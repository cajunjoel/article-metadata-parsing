The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed
account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from the date
of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the Executive
Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the
young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent
of their parents. No medal can be given for the breeding of hybrids, or of local
races or sub-species of species that have already been bred.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine before
it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of the young,
and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the species.
These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal
is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have been
awarded as possible.

With an Introduction and Descriptive Text for each Plate by
William Vogt, Editor of Bird Lore.
With 500 full-page plates in natural colours ,
exquisitely reproduced (12J ins. x 9 ins.)
Handsomely bound in green buckram with gold lettering. A marvel
of book production for the price of TWO GUINEAS NET.
This work of the most famous naturalist of America is here, for the
first time, reproduced in a single quarto volume. The work is com-
plete. It contains not only the 435 illustrations from the original
edition, but also 65 illustrations which Audubon did at a later date.
" What Gould did for the birds of the Old World, Audubon did for
the birds of the New World, depicting each species with loving skill and
as a live bird, not a stuffed specimen."--Frances Pitt (Country Life).
" The book is a superb example of fine reproduction work at a reason-
able price ."--Yorkshire Post.
" It is the kind of book which can be scanned again and again without
losing its fascination. The publishers and Mr. Vogt are to be con-
gratulated upon the moderation and good taste they have shown in
this production ."--Glasgow Herald.
" This gigantic book is a delight to own .''--The Scotsman.

The Tanagers in general are noted for their brilliant coloration,
and when the term " outstandingly beautiful " is applied to a
member of this family, it means that the bird is a living gem.
I think this can truly be said of the Blue-shouldered Tanager.
It is found in the forest of the sub-tropical zone, and does not
range to such high altitudes as most of the other large Mountain
Tanagers. My specimens were obtained between 5,000 feet and
6,000 feet. Those that I saw in their wild state were always fairly
near the ground in low trees or bushes, apparently searching for
insects. Their diet, of course, consists of fruit also, but they are
undoubtedly more insectivorous than most Tanagers.
I once saw a party of eight in a clump of second-growth behaving
more or less like Tits, clinging to the branches upside-down, and
searching under the large leaves for grubs. They are not very
wary of man, and also become very tame immediately after capture.
Their flight is rather weak for a Tanager, and they seldom fly
more than a short distance before alighting again, and being
anything but skulking in their habits they are not difficult to detect
or watch.

My Indian hunter, who was an expert with the blow-gun, had
little difficulty in stalking these unsuspecting birds, and in obtaining
several for my collection. This method of capture is a very effective
one, and is much quicker than relying on traps or nets.
Blue-shouldered Tanagers range from Central Peru to Venezuela,
but there are several races, and the one dealt with here, C. s. cyanop -
tera , is confined to the Western Andes of Ecuador and Colombia.

Luck seemed to be against us in 1938 ; the impossibly cold
and dry spring, and more still, the serious illness of Mr. F. Fooks
during April and May, were a serious handicap to successful
breeding. And to add to it, I had to make preparations for the
International Ornithological Congress which took place at Rouen
in May, so that I personally had very little time to spend with
the birds at Cleres.
The cold spring resulted in small clutches, and in the case of
all the river Ducks, no eggs at all. Mr. Fook's illness, in depriving
the birds of his experienced and assiduous care, caused the loss
of several broods. However, quite a few were reared this last
season, in spite of these unfavourable circumstances. Here is
a list of the birds, with a few notes on them.
Rheas. --We reared twenty Rheas, eleven Whites, eight Greys,
and one Darwin's. All the eggs were first incubated by the males,
then put into an incubator for a few days and hatched there.
They were brought up in small houses fitted with electric brooders.
For the first time, one Darwin's Rhea was reared out of two chicks
hatched. This very delicate species must be treated with great
care, and never allowed to eat any hard food or coarse greenstuff
for the first two months.
Ostriches and Emus laid, but their eggs proved infertile.

Cranes. --A pair of Manchurian Cranes reared a fine female,
hatched in April. They live in a 50 acre enclosure, where natural
food is plentiful, in company with Darwin's Rheas, Pseudaxis
Deer, and a few Waterfowl. The pair made up of a male Australian
and female Eastern Sarus had two young in 1937, but failed to
rear the only chick hatched rather late this year.
Two pairs of Demoiselles reared a brood as usual. The other
Cranes did not lay.
Swans. --The old pairs of Black-necked and Black Swans
reared four young each, the former hatching in March. The
American Whistling Swans showed no sign of nesting.
Geese. --The season was a good one for Geese, and the following
were reared : five Emperors, four Lesser White-fronted, two Blue
Snow, two Ross's Snow, four Magellan, six Ashy-headed, eight
Ruddy-headed, nine Andean, and four Blue-winged Geese. All,
except the last-named, were incubated under broody hens.
Sheld-ducks. --A dozen Common Sheld-ducks, six Paradise,
and ten South African were bred, as well as three hybrids, S Rajahs
X J Ruddy. Female Australian and Rajah Sheld-ducks seemed
ready to breed in the early spring, but, as usual, did not lay. It is
very doubtful whether these two fine species will ever be established
in captivity unless through cross-breeding. The f Rajah hybrids
look like Rajahs in shape, size, and general colour, but the brown
of their upper parts is lighter, almost mahogany red, and the band
across the breast is wider and rather irregular. When we obtain
the J cross, I think that it will be extremely difficult to tell them
from pure Rajahs.
Tree-ducks. --Only a very few Fulvous and Black-billed
were reared, several broods of White-faced and Red-billed
being lost.
Surface-feeding Ducks. --Fewer than usual were bred, owing
to lack of care ; just over a hundred, including Cinnamon, Brazilian,
Chestnut-breasted Teal, Chiloe and American Wigeon, and only
a few Mandarins and Carolinas. Several broods of Versicolors
were lost.
</bodyText>
<reference confidence="0.928651">
Diving Ducks. --These suffered from the same cause ; some
Scaup, Lesser Scaup, Tufted, Madagascar, and Common White-
eyes, Red-crested Pochards, Red-heads and Common Pochards
were reared.

My old Harlequin drake literally committed suicide by following
Mandarin females on foot hundreds of yards from the water, up
in the park, as they were looking for nesting holes. When I
discovered it, it was almost too late and he died of exhaustion,
never taking time to feed properly. His mate had died the summer
before, after five years on the lake.
Pheasants. --We had a fairly good season with the rarer
Pheasants, the worst failure being the loss of two Palawan chicks,
rather late hatched as usual ; we had no Germain's nor Grey
Peacock-pheasants, but we reared the following : five Rheinart's
and two Common Argus ; four Bronze-tailed Peacock-Pheasants ;
seven Temminck's, seven Blyth's, and three Satyr Tragopans ;
one hybrid Yellow-necked X Indian Koklass, six Cheer, twenty
Amhersts, six Soemmerring's, twenty-one Mikados, four Elliott's,
two Horsfield's, two Edward's, six Bel's, seven White-crested
Kalij's, four Versicolor Pheasants, six Sonneratt's, twelve Ceylon,
and fifteen Red Jungle-fowl (the latter from wild-caught parents).
Other Game Birds. --Some Wild Turkeys, Black-winged and
Common Peafowl, as well as seven Black-winged X Spicifer
hybrids. Three newly-hatched Brush Turkeys were caught in
October, only one of them being reared.
Pigeons. --Numbers of Pigmy, Tambourine, and Diamond
Doves, as well as Senegal and other commoner species were reared,
also three Long-tailed Doves, six Bar-tailed, and one Snow Pigeon.
The most interesting record is that of the Red-eyed Dove
(Melopelia cecilice ), three pairs of which I bought in July ; one
young one was reared in September. It is a very attractive little
Dove from Peru, new to aviculture, and this is its first breeding
record. The nest escaped notice, in a large and thickly planted
aviary, and we only saw the young one when it came out of the
nest, looking just like a miniature of the parents.
Of the rest of the birds, the only nesting worth mentioning is
that of the Courrier's Water Tyrants, who reared two broods, as
usual in the greenhouse.

The Avicultural Magazine devotes its pages almost entirely to
foreign birds, but would it not gain if it were a little more catholic
and comprehensive ? I cull the following passage from the August
number 1935 : its author is Dr. Amsler : " As is well known,"
he writes, " a certain faction of the Canary Fancy is aiming at a
red Canary." Come come, Dr. Amsler, as a member of the Red
Canary Club, I protest. " Section " is surely the word you were
looking for. Faction --" unscrupulous, turbulent, or self-interested
party" (Fowler). We know there have been turbulent priests
and turbulent politicians, but who ever saw a turbulent Canary-
breeder ? There is, I am told, a young man in Germany who
has taken a vow that he will never marry until he has produced
a red Canary. This may be reprehensible fanaticism ; it is
certainly not self-interest or turbulence. " We know," continues
Dr. Amsler, " that in these pages the Canary is taboo." Be it so,
I will avoid the vulgar bird. Foreign birds are aristocratic,
Budgerigars are middle-class, Canaries are plebeians. British
birds are gentlemen, and mix easily with all classes ; they deserve
a little more space than they get. For a number of years, some
thirteen altogether, it has been my endeavour to breed British
birds with new colours. Having at last, after much labour and
great expense, partly achieved this object, and having bred more
birds than I could retain, I advertised them last year in the
Avicultural Magazine ; white Sparrows, fawn, grey, and silver
Sparrows ; canary-coloured Greenfinches, blue Greenfinches,
white Thrushes, and what not. I imagined that the Avicultural
Society would be quite excited about it, and that persons of much
greater scientific competence than myself would take up the
idea. I was distinctly peeved when this advertisement, even
when repeated, brought me no inquiry, not a single letter, not one
post-card. The young man in Germany, I reflected, is very ill-
advised to eschew happiness for the sake of an object which will
not raise the slightest ripple of interest. But worse was to come.
I wrote to a very great ornithologist, saying that I had this flock of
white Sparrows, and asking whether he knew of any suitable island

or country without Sparrows, where I could send these and
establish a new variety of birds in the wild state. He replied very
shortly : " On no account release these birds . 35 To him I think
they were a sort of lapse from ornithological good taste, offensive
in the way that abominable neologisms like " air-drome 33 would
be to the late Fowler. [Let me, in passing, pay tribute to H. W.
Fowler. Not only the final authority on our language, but a Stoic
sage whom no calamity could shake, yet sensitive as a tremulous
leaf to the least breach of taste ; who was a fit companion for
Socrates himself, yet would make friends with the most ordinary
man if he liked him ; who was too humane to put a worm upon
a hook, yet when approaching sixty, sought successfully to reach
the front trenches in the War. England will not see his like again ;
not that England ever did see him, for he hid himself]
The neologisms of Nature are all beautiful. Her most out-
standing characteristic is infinite variety ; her evident object is
the creation of endless new forms and colours ; when man inter-
venes to quicken the process by a million years or so, he is merely
giving Nature a little help with her own job, and anyone who
shudders at the idea of a blue Nightingale, or yellow Skylark,
is a sentimentalist. It is human and natural to delight in novelty,
and were it not so, the world would stand still.
My next step was more fortunate. I took a few of my dead
and stuffed specimens to the Zoo and called on Mr. Seth-Smith,
who was most kindly interested in the matter. It is, moreover,
at his request that in spite of being, as I say, distinctly peeved,
I write these notes for only such of the members as wish to know
more about the breeding of our native birds in captivity. Such
articles on this subject as have appeared in the Avicultural
Magazine have emphasized and exaggerated the difficulties of
the matter. In actual fact, it is easy to breed our native birds.
How could it be otherwise when constant successes are achieved
with foreign birds for which our climate is unfavourable, while
their natural food may be unprocurable, and in many cases they
would normally breed in our December ? What, then, are the
causes of failure and the conditions of success ?
We are assured at the outset of the first essential, namely,
vigorous stock. The average novice in bird-breeding begins with
Canaries, and usually purchases from a dealer the " surplus 33

birds of other breeders ; that is to say, in many cases, the old hens,
the non-feeding hens, and the sterile hens discarded by their
owners. Where, alas, is the citizen of Roman virtue, the Christian,
observant of the Golden Rule, who never puts into circulation
a bird that will cause sorrow and trouble to its possessor ? What
wretchedness has been caused to the ignorant--and to the expert
also--by the inane degenerates to be found so frequently among
Canaries. With the wild bird we have never this fundamental
difficulty to fear. Here is a creature equipped with all its vital
instincts unimpaired, and if we respect those instincts, success
will certainly follow. The first relevant fact about most wild birds
is that they conceal their nests carefully. It should therefore be
necessary to go bird-nesting in our own aviary, and it has happened
occasionally that a bird has reared its young unknown to me in an
aviary where I have sat daily for an hour or more, so well was
the nest concealed and so careful were the parents not to visit it
till I was gone. To provide such opportunities for privacy may
be a counsel of perfection, but it is definitely insufficient to put up
a mere bunch of heather in which only the actual nest is out of
sight.
Then there is the question of society or solitude. Sparrows
will hardly breed in single pairs, and love the stimulus of a chattering
crowd, while Bullfinches prefer the company, in isolation, of their
own devoted spouse. Greenfinches, I think, like a certain amount
of social life. I have bred over four hundred of these birds in various
conditions, and find the best results in large aviaries with two or
three pairs ; or a single cock with two hens, when the trio have
been long acquainted, will do very well. Greenfinches, however,
are accommodating birds, easier to breed than even hardy Border
Canaries. Much has been written in this journal and elsewhere
of the difficulties of rearing their young to maturity, losses of 95
and 100 per cent being mentioned. This difficulty is real in a
sense ; that is to say, the young Greenfinch must have his natural
food, and will otherwise get enteritis and die. Since I have pro-
vided an unlimited amount of chickweed, etc. (for which if necessary
I send out a man in a car to ravage gardens and allotments far
and near), I have had little trouble with these birds. The average
breeder, with a small stock, can easily himself grow all he requires.
It is not only Greenfinches, moreover, which need natural food in

abundance. Bullfinches are particular also, though the complaint
usually made is that the hen lets her young die at about ten days,
and this too is true if proper food is not provided. Bullfinches require
plenty of insects for their young. I learned this from once
watching a pair in my aviaries feeding their nestlings on chunks
of earthworms gouged out of the bodies of large specimens provided
for a pair of Thrushes. This diet was clearly " Ersatz " for insects.
Since then I have always let them have mealworms, live ant-eggs,
etc., and I see them catch many gnats, etc., in their aviaries.
Greenfinches eat no live food at all. It is stated in that great new
work, British Birds , published by Messrs. Witherby, that the
young of the Greenfinch are fed chiefly on fC insects and their larvae
with a few macerated seeds ", but unless the authors have absolute
proof of their statement, based on the examination of crop contents,
it should be corrected. It is a mistake due to repeating the error
of earlier writers.
My Greenfinches have, in several of their aviaries, access to
a wide selection of insects provided for other species. I have sat
for countless hours in these aviaries, and have seen some surprising
events, but I have never seen a Greenfinch touch an insect or any
live food, either specially provided, or on the wing, or on the
ground. As the authorities are so unanimous on the point, I
endeavoured to put it to the proof so far as proving a negative is
possible. I managed to get four young Greenfinches fostered
by Sparrows. I say " managed ", because anyone who has tried
to use wild Sparrows as foster-mothers well knows that it is next
to impossible to do so. I succeeded in this solitary instance by
waiting till both parent Sparrows were absent, and then swiftly
substituting four newly-hatched Greenfinches for the four Sparrows'
eggs which were due to hatch. A Sparrow knows and ejects an
unfamiliar egg or an unfamiliar youngster, but though this pair
manifested the utmost surprise and a most comic excitement at
finding four hatched in less than five minutes, they did adopt them.
The young failed to thrive on Sparrow diet, mainly insects, of
course, " with a few macerated seeds." They died ; two on the
second day, a third on the third day, and the fourth on the fourth
day. Conversely young Sparrows placed under Greenfinches
died, or languished till removed. Is not this conclusive ? From
the interchange of wild nestlings, which I used to practise as a

small schoolboy, much may be learned without the infliction of
death. I tried at that remote period to see if Robins would rear
a Thrush as they rear Cuckoos ; but the young Thrush grew thinner
and thinner, till it was removed. A single experiment is in-
sufficient, but it is likely that the young Cuckoo has a special gift
for obtaining his wants. Having reared two Cuckoos by hand,
I can certify that the human baby itself has not a greater power
of making itself intolerable until its wants are gratified.
Among the other leading instincts of most birds there is the
impulse to hunt. A mere gnat seems able to excite in Chaffinches
and many other Finches all the excitement which is caused by a
rat to a dog, or a rising salmon to a fisherman. A cement-bottomed
aviary, fitted up with dead branches, attracts no insects, and provides
no sport. Some breeders have done fairly well with small aviaries,
but to obtain success, consistently and easily, a large aviary with
a varied bottom of woodland, arable, and meadow--all to scale--
is far better. Some breeders, after losses due to quarrels and mutual
interference, are all for quiet little aviaries, housing one pair of
birds. That is a counsel of despair, for a small aviary, by limiting
exercise, reduces at once the breeder's chances. Whether we keep
birds or mammals, plenty of exercise is the first condition of success.
In a large aviary that is suitably planted, suitably sheltered, and
thinly enough populated, almost any British birds can doubtless
be successfully bred by anybody who knows accurately on what his
birds feed when wild. It must be remembered that adolescent birds,
two or three months old, do not always eat what they will eat when
adult : I observe on a large chickweed patch outside my aviaries,
at certain seasons, numbers of adolescent Greenfinches and
Chaffinches, but scarcely any adults at all.
Pursuing a special object as regards colours, I have not tried
to breed any great number of species, but my collection has
included Sparrows, Greenfinches, Goldfinches, Chaffinches, Robins,
Hedge-Sparrows, Bearded Tits, Blackbirds, Thrushes, and Starlings.
Most of these birds have been " sports ", albinos, cinnamons, etc.
Some " pairs " proved to be two hens, so naturally they got no
further than eggs. I have twenty-two aviaries. A sample census
for one of the eight large ones (31 X 20 X 15 ft.) is as follows,
for one summer. A pair of Thrushes, a pair of Bearded Tits, two
pairs of Greenfinches, one of Chaffinches, and two of Sparrows.

A. H. SCOTT-NEW BIRDS FOR OLD
These birds all built and laid peaceably, though now I usually
exclude Sparrows from mixed collections. The Bearded Tits built
unwisely, inside the shelter, and their eggs were attacked by mice,
but that was the only casualty or failure. In former seasons I have
sometimes lost heavily through mice, but have dealt with them
successfully this year and last. * Many aviaries have been required
for Greenfinches and Sparrows, as there are several colours of
each ; and those of each colour must of course be separate. The
Greenfinches are nearly all in single pairs or trios, but have other
species to keep them company. It may be mentioned that birds with
a show-bench career behind them usually took a whole year,
often two, and in one case three years to recover their reproductive
instincts, whereas I have had wild birds caught in March that bred
in April. " Humanitarians," please note !
As regards new colours, a fairly full account of my results
appeared in Cage Birds (30th September), and I will give here only
a brief summary. I lost years through trying to breed albinos from
pink-eyed white birds which in some cases were not true albinos.
Even when a bird is a true albino, success is hardly possible unless
at least two unrelated specimens are used. Pink and red-eyed birds
will not stand in-breeding. As regards the birds I now have, they
would be much more numerous but for a heavy loss last December,
when a record snowstorm and gale crushed to the ground all the
largest of my aviaries, and set free or killed about fifty birds,
including all but two of the twelve white pink-eyed Sparrows,
the pair of white Starlings, and all but one of the blue Greenfinches,
which died later. I was left with only three yellow Greenfinches,
one pink-eyed cinnamon, some silver, cinnamon, and fawn
Sparrows, a cinnamon Chaffinch, and two albino Thrushes. There
remained also, however, normal coloured individuals carrying the
necessary factors for further progress, including two lutino-bred
cock Greenfinches, and during the spring I was able to buy three
or four more " rare-feathered " birds of various kinds. By the end
of the season I had about sixty-four with the new colours. These
included two albino Thrushes, some thirty Sparrows, mostly
silvers as these breed true, about twenty-four Greenfinches, of
which five were lutinos (now reduced to three vigorous ones)
and the rest pale yellow with cinnamon suffusion in the wing tips,
golden fawn, silver grey, and just one of a pale slate-blue from which

I hope to recapture the lost colour. There were also three cinnamon
Chaffinches, one a cock, doubtless the only one in existence,
and two clear yellow Chaffinches. The Greenfinches are mostly
descended from a yellow sport, a lutino, and a slate-blue, procured
in 1932. Another yellow, a fawn, and a silver-grey were added
later, so no extreme inbreeding has been necessary in most cases,
and the stock is very strong. Three dozen or more silver Zebra-
Finches were also bred this year. These, as has already been
mentioned by M. Delacour, were first bred in a Californian aviary
and recently imported into England. Perhaps a " faction " of
foreign bird breeders may be interested in them, and in the white
variety which I also keep, but somehow our own familiar British
friends please me better than any. If anyone will give me a yellow
Wren, or an all-blue Blue Tit, I will give him a handful of new

THE EARLY YEARS OF THE AVICULTURAL
SOCIETY

As one looks at the forty-five bound volumes of the Avicultural
Magazine one's memory goes back to the early days of the Society
and one feels a little proud to have been associated with it from the
start, though personally I cannot claim to have had anything to do
with its actual foundation.
One day, in November, 1894, I called upon Mr. J. B. Housden
at his home in Sydenham to see his very fine collection of birds.
I remember how delighted I was with his Crested Pigeons which
had reared numbers of young ; with his splendid pair of Eagle
Owls which would attack any intruder, as they had a nest, and with
his many other birds, amongst which were several well-known
prizewinners. I remember also that Mr. Housden asked me if I
had heard of the new Magazine of which the first number was then
in proof. He had a proof in his pocket which he kindly gave to me.
It was, I thought, just what was wanted by the large number of
persons who were interested in the keeping of foreign and British
birds. I myself had kept a few and was about as keen as one could
very well be on birds of all kinds, and the various lovely foreign

species that one came across at bird shows such as that held every
year at the Crystal Palace, were an immense delight. But what we
wanted was a Society which all those of my way of thinking could
join, with a journal of its own. Here it was in its infancy and I
asked Mr. Housden to put me up as a member, which he kindly did,
and my name appeared as a candidate for election in the number
for December, 1894. So, though not entitled to call myself an
Original Member, I am indeed one of the earliest.
Commencing as it did in November, the first volume finished
with the number for the following October, and for many years
November was the month in which the Society's year started.
Brighton was the birthplace of the Society and its Magazine,
for there lived two very keen foreign bird keepers, Dr. C. S.
Simpson and Mr. H. R. Fillmer, to whom the credit of founding
the Society belongs. They were ably helped by others in
London and the provinces, foremost amongst whom must be
mentioned Dr. A. G. Butler, who held a post in the Entomological
Department of the British Museum but studied birds as his hobby ;
Reginald Phillipps, whose small garden in West Kensington was
completely wired over as an aviary ; the Honourable and Reverend
F. G. Dutton, rector of the charming village of Bibury in the
Cotswolds, and a great authority on Parrots ; Mr. H. T. T. Camps,
another Parrot expert ; and our old friends Mr. John Frostick and
Mr. Housden, both of whose names are still upon our list.
In the first number of the Magazine the objects of the Society
were explained. It was felt that there was a large and increasing
number of people scattered all over the country who were greatly
interested in birds and bird-keeping, but who, by reason of their
living so far apart, could never meet to compare notes or form
themselves into ordinary Societies which exist for and by the holding
of meetings. Now a Society was offered which held no meetings,
but kept together by means of the post.
" One of our chief objects," we read, " will be to endeavour to
bridge over the gulf that exists between the lover of birds and the
scientific ornithologist--we believe that each has much to learn
from the other. We want to infuse a little science into bird-keeping
and to interest the cabinet ornithologist in the habits of birds."
The first volume, edited by C. S. Simpson and H. R. Fillmer,
contains articles on both British and foreign birds, the objects of

D. SETH-SMITH-EARLY YEARS OF AVIGULTURAL SOCIETY I 3
the Editors being to provide articles on these in fairly equal propor-
tions, a policy that might with advantage be followed at the
present time. The chief contributors to the first volume were
A. G. Butler, Horatio R. Fillmer, Reginald Phillipps, and
G. S. Simpson, though amongst others who helped with their
writings were three well-known ornithologists---J. Lewis Bonhote,
E. G. B. Meade-Waldo, and W. H. St. Quintin. Bonhote was, at
that time, an undergraduate at Cambridge and was one of a small
band of keen ornithologists there. His first article was on the
Spotted Flycatcher.
Meade-Waldo and St. Quintin were of the very best type of
country gentlemen, the one living in the south, the other in the
north. They were naturalists through and through, their chief
delight being in the observation of Nature. Both were great on
Bird Protection and they were first-rate aviculturists. They
corresponded almost daily, their letters being full of the most
interesting observations. I have often thought that if those letters
could have been published we should have had a volume as
interesting and instructive as White's Selborne.
Meade-Waldo spent a good deal of time in the Canary Islands
and Algeria, and on several occasions brought home birds. So we
find him writing on the Teydean Chaffinch, the lovely blue
Chaffinch of the Teneriffe, and in Volume II on the Moorish House
Bunting (Fringillaria saharce) and the Desert Trumpeter Bullfinch
(Erythrospiza githaginea ), all of which he succeeded in breeding at
home.
The name of O. E. Cress well first appears in Volume I. He
owned a lovely place in Herefordshire where he kept numbers of
rare Parrakeets and Doves.
In Volume II the name of the Rev. Hubert D. Astley first
appears with delightful articles on " The Nesting of the Storm
Petrel 55 and S# The Blue Rock Thrush 3? , the latter illustrated by
a wash drawing of the bird by the author. Astley was a great
aviculturist and a very delightful personality, with the means to
indulge very thoroughly in his hobby. In this volume appears for
the first time the name of the Rev. C. D. Farrar, Vicar of Micklefield
in Yorkshire, who writes on cc Breeding in the Open Air Sub-
sequently he became a very regular contributor, some of his
articles causing considerable controversy among the members.

He called upon me once and I found him quite delightful, though
we had often quarrelled through the post.
In Volume II we find also articles by Bonhote on British birds,
Fillmer on the Grosbeaks, Reginald Phillipps on the nesting of
the Rosy-faced Lovebird, and St. Quintin describing his success
in breeding Kestrels. Dr. C. S. Simpson found it necessary to
resign the Secretaryship on account of pressure of other duties.
He had been largely responsible for setting the Society going and
editing its Magazine, and now handed over the secretarial duties
to Mr. H. R. Fillmer who had, up to then, acted as Treasurer.
With Volume III (November, 1896) appear the first coloured
plates, three in number, depicting the Pine Grosbeak, the
Ornamented Lorikeet, and the Diamond Dove, all drawn by
F. W. Frohawk and hand-coloured. A series of articles on " The
Fringillinae 55 is commenced, the species dealt with being the
Pine Grosbeak (A. G. Butler), Bullfinch (Albert Rettich), Yellow-
throated Rock Sparrow (E. G. B. Meade-Waldo), the Chaffinch
(J. L. Bonhote), Black-headed Siskin (V. Castellan), Siskin
(T. Marshall), Green Singing Finch (W. T. Gatleugh), Lesser
Redpoll (G. G. Swailes), Alario Finch (H. R. Fillmer), Brambling
(J. L. Bonhote), Saffron Finch (A. G. Butler), and Linnet (J. H.
Verrall).
In these early volumes, besides many excellent articles the
Correspondence columns were well filled. There was a system of
printing queries and the answers to them where these were of
general interest to aviculturists, and here again is something that
might be revived.
Volume IV, which commences in November, 1897, contains
hand-coloured plates of the Chinese Quail and Chinese Spectacle-
bird {Zoster ops simplex ), both by Frohawk, and of the Golden-
shouldered Parrakeet and the White-eared Grassfinch by P. J. Smit.
Of the true Golden-shouldered Parrakeet (Psephotus chrysopterygius )
six specimens were imported in 1897, and I am not aware of the
arrival of any since. They were all immature birds and only one
(in the pair acquired by the London Zoo) proved to be a male.
Mr. Reginald Phillipps acquired a couple of hens and contributes
a long and very interesting article. Of the White-eared Grassfinch
(.Pcephila leucotis) Phillipps also contributes an excellent account.
The bird is much like the Masked Grassfinch but more beautiful,

and I have not seen any since those days. Smit's plate is extremely
good. He was an artist of great ability, as his father had been before
him, and it was a loss to the Society when he took up his abode in
South Africa.
In this volume Mr. George E. Bouskill records the successful
breeding for the first time in this country of the Golden-crowned
Parrakeet of New Zealand, for which he received the Society's
medal, as did also Mr. R. A. Todd for breeding the Long-tailed
Grassfinch.
The Society had now got into its stride and was able to produce
an excellent magazine, full of very useful matter.

BREEDING RECORDS : SUMMARY V

As this has carried on into another year, it will be as well to
repeat here the Introduction which preceded Part I on p. 190 of
last year's volume :--
Since the appearance of Records of Birds Bred in Captivity in 1926
much more material has accumulated and here an attempt is
made to provide a summary of all the records to date on the lines
of Part III of the original work, that is, indicating the values of the
various records by change of type. These values must necessarily
differ as the sources of error are many--from simple mistakes in
identification and observation down to downright misstatements,
as I fear many of the recent claims for success with British Birds
must be considered. We are all familiar nowadays with the
advertisements of aviary- (or cage-) bred Britishers, and I think
nearly every possible British cage-bird has so appeared ; at any
rate I have seen most, " A.B., C.R., etc.," even Nightingales and
Long-tailed Tits, but surely the biscuit must be awarded to the
advertiser (in January) of " Linnets : cage-bred, is. each, or
95". a dozen if a quantity are taken ". Gould anybody breed even
white mice or cockroaches, keep them six months, and then sell

them at 9 d. ? This sort of thing had naturally made one suspicious
of all records, but that cannot be helped, and I am sure we can be
certain that there are plenty of good records for a great number of
birds including British. Here the compiler gives his opinion of the
values and hopes with help from others to amplify the records
later on.
Towards an ideal record of the future successful breeders could
give much help by telling us in each case :--
How many young birds left the nest ?
How many of these lived to moult ?
How many survived a year or longer ?
Did any of the young breed again ?
Except for Canaries, Budgerigars, and a few other species,
I am afraid the answer to the last question would be " none 55 for
the cage-birds proper, that is excluding Ducks, Game Birds, and
the like. I fear too that in most cases the answers to the other
questions would not be too encouraging.
No details are given here but perhaps I may mention that
Records is still obtainable at 155. by anyone sufficiently interested
and that the publishers are Messrs. Witherby, High Holborn,
London. It is on this that most of the present effort is based.
Some fifty pages of additions appeared in the Magazine in
1 932-3 and those of more recent date are included here. Any
information I have is at the service of anyone really interested.
The figures with each entry, and the letters for the hybrids
are those of the original book. Capitals indicate that the species
(or hybrid) has certainly been bred : large capitals that the
record is self-sufficient, small ones that the actual breeding can be
(at least in my opinion) taken as certain, but that further detail is
desirable. When a name appears in ordinary print, it means that
the record is not entirely satisfactory, when brackets enclose an
entry it is considered at best doubtful, and when a query (?) is
added real doubt is indicated, and more queries, more doubt.

Before leaving England I consulted the Zoo Library as to what
books there were obtainable on the birds of Jamaica or the West
Indies and was fortunate to find that a new handbook had just been
published by the Academy of National Science of Philadelphia, of
which J. S. Bond was the Editor. This was most helpful, par-
ticularly as it gives the local names, together with the English.
Where Latin nomenclature is given it will be that quoted in the
above book.
A few words are necessary here on the avifauna generally of the
West Indies.
It appears that the birds of these Islands generally belong to
North American or the Arctic rather than to South American or
Neo-tropical families. There are exceptions, and Trinidad and
Tobago are not included as being West Indian Islands.
We left London on 7th January by the Rangiiiki and, with the
exception of the ubiquitous Seagull, saw no bird until a couple of
days prior to our arrival at Jamaica.
Incidentally, the Gulls have given me much cause for thought.
About thirty or forty followed the ship from England and a day after
passing the Azores there were still six or so left, but the next morn-
ing they had disappeared. As I wrote on the Hans a bound for
Southampton, there were still a few Gulls about, yet we were fully

800 miles from New York. What happens to them ? Do they sight
a returning ship in due course and leave this ship ? Do they fly
through the night or roost on the rigging ?
Before reaching Jamaica, the first bird to be recorded was the
Frigate Bird (Fregata magnificens ).
The tail of this bird is forked, but whilst in flight it merely
appears as long and pointed.
Outside Kingston Harbour the Brown Pelican (Pelecanus
occidentalis ) was seen in numbers and, to watch their heavy flight
about fifteen feet above the water and then to see them drop
suddenly into the sea after fish is a sight to be remembered. They
appear to be common all round the coast of Jamaica.
The next bird to attract attention on entering Kingston Harbour
is the "John Crow ". This is the local name for the Red-headed
Turkey Vulture (Cathartes aura). During 1,000 miles of motoring
over most of Jamaica we never failed to see "John Crow ". They
are rigidly protected in the West Indies for they act as scavengers,
but it is a little difficult to understand how they all obtain food,
for there appear to be thousands of them.
I was fortunate enough to obtain a cinematograph record of six
or seven, which were about to deal with a puppy lying in the road,
presumably killed by a car. They did condescend to move a few
yards away as I approached with the camera, but were quite
unconcerned. On another occasion, motoring back from Port
Morant to Kingston, I had to apply brakes suddenly in order to
avoid two of them, which were engrossed in fighting in mid-air,
from crashing through the wind-screen.
We came across them high up in the mountains and their
graceful soaring flight appears quite effortless.
Whilst returning from Montego Bay over the mountains I saw
through field-glasses a bird of similar size to the Turkey Vulture,
but the under parts were white, as were the wings except for black
tips to the primaries. I have been unable to trace what it could
have been and wonder if it was an albinistic variety of Cathartes
aura ; it was in company with about a dozen of them.
It may be as well to give here some few details of the climate
and vegetation of Jamaica.
The island is situated in the Caribbean Sea, about 18 degrees
latitude north and about 600 miles east of the American Continent.

The temperature at Kingston appears to average between 75-80
degrees, but drops as higher ground is reached. At Newcastle,
about 19 miles from Kingston and about 4,000 feet up, the tempera-
ture was under 60 degrees, and I was told that in the early mornings
might drop to 50 degrees. I was a little surprised, therefore, to see
a Humming Bird, the Red-billed Streamer-tail, of which more
anon.
The wet season on the south part of the island is September,
October, and November, though the north side gets considerably
more and at more varied times.
It is impossible to give more than an outline of the vegetation,
and the beauty must be seen to be believed. Suffice to say it is
tropical and dense in most parts, with a profusion of flowers,
Bougainvillia, Hibiscus, Flame of the Forest, Poinsettia, and many
others of which I did not know the names. The tree-ferns alone
are worth seeing, to which must be added bananas, oranges, limes,
pineapples, and numberless other fruit trees.
I fear, however, that I have digressed, and probably the first
bird on land to draw attention is the Smooth-billed Ani (Crotophaga
ani) , known locally as the Blackbird. It is an awkward clumsy
looking bird with glossy black plumage and a large beak. It is
ubiquitous and quite fearless. There were hundreds on the golf
course at Constant Spring and as it is insectivorous, must do a
lot of good. Rather like a large Starling in the way it hops
around the grass looking under tufts for food. The nesting habits
are peculiar, several hens apparently using one nest, the eggs
being laid in layers. Mr. Bond states that one nest of twenty-one
eggs and another of twenty were found in the West Indies.
After the Ani comes the Northern Mocking Bird (Mimus
polyglottus ). This bird is very common and on account of its song
is known locally as the Nightingale. It reminded me, in flight,
of a large hen Shama.
The song is attractive, though presumably made up from the
songs of other birds. The general colouring is brownish grey and
the wings have a certain amount of white.
We went from Kingston one morning up to Newcastle, where are
stationed part of the West Indies garrison. Just beyond Newcastle
the altitude is over 4,000 feet, and here two English ladies provide
visitors with tea and other refreshments. Their cottage is situated

off the road and in tropical vegetation. But the temperature can
drop into the " fifties 55 --was barely 60 degrees when we arrived--
which after Kingston we noticed considerably.
The Misses Paine had made a practice of putting food out for
the birds and in the short time I saw many, though was unable to
identify them all.
The most striking was the Orangequit ( Euneornis campestris).
The cock is violet blue with a deep red patch on the throat. The
hen is olive, becoming brown on the wings and tail. About 5^-
inches long, this genus is restricted in the West Indies to Jamaica.
It is a lovely bird and two cocks were soon fighting over the food
placed for them.
In company with the Euneornis was the Antillean Bananaquit
(Ccereba Jiaveola).
This is a pretty bird, slightly smaller than the Orangequit, and it
is interesting to watch how quickly it climbs the bushes, inserting its
beak into the flowers for nectar. It is easily recognized by the black
upper parts, golden yellow under parts, and white superciliary stripe.
Of several Finches present I was able to recognize only three :
The Jamaican Euphonia (. Pyrrhuphonia Jamaica ), the Yellow-
backed Finch ( Loxipasser anoxanthus) , and the Black-faced Grassquit
(Tiaris bicolor ).
The last is a cousin of the Cuban Finch ( Tiaris canora) and
around Mandeville 1 saw a number of the Yellow-faced Grassquit
(Tiaris olivacea) . These appear to be very common throughout the
West Indies. And last but not least, the Red-billed Streamer-tail
(.Aithurus polytmus).
Known locally as the Doctor Bird (why, I could not discover),
this Humming Bird is most striking and beautiful in flight. When
I say " in flight 55 I mean whilst hovering, for it is next to impossible
to follow them when they move away to another spot. The
streamers, confined to the cock, are nearly twice the length of the
bird, which is almost 4 inches long. The head is black and the rest
of the body appears green, but it is difficult to give exact details
owing to the marvellous iridescent reflections from the plumage.
This Humming Bird is quite common in Jamaica and I
recognized it in many other parts, often whilst perched.
There were numbers in Hope Gardens, about 7 miles out of
Kingston, and also in Castleton Gardens about 30 miles from

Kingston on the road to Port Antonio. Incidentally, Castleton
Gardens are well worth a visit from anyone going to Jamaica.
The plants, trees, tree-ferns, and flowers are beautiful though not
all are indigenous to the island.
Of the other two Humming Birds found in Jamaica, the Mango
Humming Bird (Anthracothorax mango) is the easiest seen on account
of its size.
I took many photographs of them at Constant Spring, where the
favourite flower appeared to be the Hibiscus, and they seem to prefer
open situations.
The third, the Vervain Humming Bird (Mellisuga minima ), is the
second smallest bird known, the smallest being the Bee Humming
Bird (i Calypte Helena) from Cuba.
On many occasions I mistook this bird for a large bumble bee,
and once it moved it was impossible to follow where it had gone.
The only thing was to wait patiently in the hope it would return.
At Nassau, in the Bahamas, I saw quite a few Bahaman
Woodstars (Nesophlox evelyna ), and here it was possible to watch
how part of the flower was lifted by the beak before the bird could
insert this to obtain the nectar. I am very pleased to have seen
Humming Birds in their natural state and with time and patience
it should not be too difficult to learn quite a lot about their habits.
In Montego Bay the Greater Antillean Grackle (Holoquisquatus
niger ), known locally as the Ting-Ting, is very common and also
very bold. They will come up to a table for a piece of cake or biscuit
much as Sparrows will come to a bird tray in this country. The
plumage is glossy violet black, becoming greenish on the wings ;
in fact, they are very similar to the Glossy Starlings, though they
appeared to me as being of a slighter build. The iris is yellow, but
the most striking feature is the keel-shaped tail, which is most
apparent when the bird is in flight.
Just outside Montego Bay I saw the Belted Kingfisher (Megaceryle
alcyon). This bird is a winter visitor to the West Indies.
The upper parts are ashy blue, but the distinguishing feature is a
broad white collar around the neck.
Apparently they are equally at home in fresh or salt water whilst
seeking food, for two we saw were diving for fish in the shallows
which surround most of the coast. Near here we came across on two
separate occasions a bird which I have taken to be the Snowy

Egret ( Egretta thula). It is classed as very rare in Jamaica, but I do
not think I have confused it with the American Egret ( Casmerodius
albus), also rare, on account of the size.
The latter should be considerably larger than the birds we saw.
As the name implies it is white and I had an excellent view of it
on the second occasion. It was walking along the road near Montego
Bay, and I managed to take some few feet of film but the bird does
not show up too well on account of the whiteness of the road. It
allowed me to approach within 30 yards and then flew away only
to settle on the road again a little farther off.
On several occasions we came across a small bird climbing round
the branches of trees, apparently seeking insects. It was about
5 inches long and striped black and white longitudinally. I believe
this to be a migrant Warbler called the Black and White Warbler
(Mniotila varia). The quick movements were reminiscent of a
Treecreeper. The local name is Ant Bird.
I saw in a private house in Kingston several of the pretty little
Ground Doves ( Columbigallina passerina). They are only about
6 inches long, and I was tempted to bring some back, but we were
returning via New York and it would have been very difficult.
In the same aviary as the Ground Dove were several White
Crowned Pigeons ( Columba leucocephala) . Known locally as Bald-
pates, they are about the size of a London Pigeon and, as their name
implies, have a white patch which extends over the head. This patch
tends to greyish in the hen.
I think the above is all I have to tell of the birds I saw in Jamaica,
but I was amused to see the House Sparrow happily enjoying
himself in Havana. It was introduced into Cuba in the late part of
the nineteenth century, and seems to thrive, particularly in the towns.
Thirty-six hours before arriving at New York, and just after we
had left the Gulf Stream and reached cold weather, a small bird
came on to the ship. It was just dusk and the ship was fully 300
miles from land. The bird was exhausted and we succeeded in
catching it, but in spite of all efforts to persuade it to take food
it died the next morning.
Slightly smaller than our Blue Tit, the upper parts were greyish
blue with some green on the wings, the under parts were white and
the abdomen yellow, the beak was yellow, and there were rectal
bristles, but I have not discovered what it was nor any reason for it

The young Sandhill Cranes have got their red caps and to all
appearances are full grown. They stand as high as their father and
quite dwarf their mother, who is a rather small specimen of her
kind. Possibly she belongs to another " race They are as grey
as their parents, which is rather remarkable, for usually this species
is brown until the first moult ; both the old birds were brown when
they first came to us, and it was quite six months before they changed
colour. The youngsters have not yet found their voices so their sex
is still uncertain.
The Pheasants are all in perfect plumage. Considering all
things we have bred a fair number of Pheasants, Mikados,
Edward's, Firebacks, and all the four species of Tragopans.
Unluckily cocks greatly predominate.
The pair of tiny Galapagos Ground Doves with which we started
have increased and multiplied and now number seven. They are
very tame and we have to " watch our step " when we enter their
compartments for they run about close to our feet hoping for
pieces of pea-nut. Like all Doves they are very pugnacious and as
soon as the young are fledged they are driven off by their parents.
Though called " Ground Doves " they do not always nest on the
ground ; the first nest was on the ground in a corner of the house,
but the succeeding ones were all fairly high up. The pair of
Australian Crested Ground Doves also went to nest after dropping
eggs galore about their aviary. They hatched two, but only reared
one. They, too, appreciate pea-nuts. The cock displays alike to
friend or fancied foe with grunts and pecks. He attacks a cock
Swinhoe Pheasant in the next compartment and pecks his head
through the wires, blissfully unconscious that the Pheasant takes

it as a friendly act and holds his head close up to allow the Dove
to tickle it.
A very fine pair of Lidth's Jays are new arrivals ; they are in
perfect plumage and absolutely fearless, fairly mob one for tit-bits.
Pea-nuts are much appreciated, a bird will carry off three at a
time and either peck them to pieces then and there or hide them
for future consumption. Pea-nuts seem to be the passport to the
friendship of most of our birds. Even the beautiful Grey-necked
Crowned Cranes come running with outstretched wings as soon
as a possible pea-nut bearer comes in sight.
Since the above was written our collection has been enriched
by the arrival of a pair of rare Hooded Cranes. We have only
(but what an " only " !) to acquire three more species before we
realize our ambition and have pairs of all the family, viz. : the
Wattled, the Grey-necked and the Whooper. Don't we wish we
may get them !

It occurred to me that, perhaps, some of the members of the
Avicultural Society might like to have an account of some of my
birds here at full liberty. They are all full-winged. About four
years ago, while in Tokyo, I saw a miserable little dirty object
in an absolutely minute cage--just big enough to hold what
afterwards turned out to be " Oscar ", my Japanese Starling.
I bought him and he travelled across America with me, and also
some other birds. He was not tame when I bought him, but
quickly became so and was allowed loose on the boat, and also
on the train crossing America. He is, I think, the tamest bird
I have ever owned. I once took him to stay at Mr. Ezra's, and let
him out directly I got there ; Mr. Ezra thought he had
gone for keeps as at that time he did not know the bird, but
/ did. He returned, as he always does, directly I whistled to
him, from some high trees at the back of the house. I can take
him anywhere in the car and let him loose and he will never go
far--always flying back when whistled for. So fond of me is this
extraordinary little creature that at night when the electric light
is on and he is running about the room and flying on to the

pictures, he will fly from a brightly lighted room into a completely
dark room to find me if I call him. To anyone who knows a bird's
fear and helplessness in the dark this will give some idea of what
a very abnormal creature he is--I know no other bird which
would do so. He will go for walks and comes exploring the garden,
and woe betide any other bird who comes near him. Exploring
nests and spearing young birds, or feeding them with any rubbish
he has in his beak, is one of his favourite pastimes. He is keen on
nest-building, and builds them of any old rubbish he can find,
and in any situation ; one day it may be an old boot, the next
day an open drawer, etc. He is a great talker, and very clear--
some of his sayings are perhaps more " pithy " than pure ! He
loathes strangers and immediately flys at them and pecks them.
One friend of mine he loathes like the devil, and if he sees his car
in the yard will fly on to the car and peck it, screaming the whole
time until he is literally tired out. I never feed this bird myself,
and he hates mealworms strangely enough, so that it is not
" cupboard love " and is a real attachment. Just as a dog never
leaves one--so it is with " Oscar ". He is about as big as a Starling,
black head, white cheeks, white rump, dark grey almost black
wings and tail, and the rest a pale French grey with a yellowish
black bill and yellow feet and legs. He is very fond of the cook,
but if I am about will leave her at once, and he nearly went mad
this year when he saw me after nine months' absence. He flew
straight on to my shoulder and a spate of words poured out of
him, singing and chattering--it made me feel a beast for having left
him so long. One cannot keep him out of the house and all windows
would have to be shut to do this for he knows every window that
is likely to be open. When he dies, which I hope will not be for
many years, I shall, I am certain, never see one like him again, he
really has to be seen to be believed !
Another very charming bird which I have had for nine years
is a Hangnest. He is bright orange and black and about as big
as a Blackbird, with a very sharp blue beak and blue legs and feet.
He is very affectionate and good-tempered and a most intelligent
bird. He will open a cigarette box and give me a cigarette and then
a match, and does several other tricks. He spends most of the
summer flying about the garden, and only uses his cage to feed
and sleep in. This bird appears to have no natural song, but

is a wonderful whistler and one would think it was a human being
whistling if one did not know. He is an ill-tempered bird with other
birds, and is a " killer He believes that all wives should be
murdered and does so promptly, so now he is a widower and will
remain so. He has a very charming swift flight which is difficult
to describe, but if he is pleased or excited he makes a peculiar sort
of " clapping 55 with his wings when flying. This is very noticeable
when he has been let out of the house first thing in the morning,
and, perhaps, does not see me until lunch time. Directly he sees
me, or hears my voice, he will come like a shot out of a gun, and
one can hear him coming by his peculiar flight. He can, and very
often does, fly absolutely silently. His favourite food is greenfly,
of which he gets plenty in the summer, going over the roses far
more thoroughly than any " spray 55 ever does !
Another very nice bird is an exceptionally tame Formosan
Magpie. These birds are not very common, I think, and I have
hopes of them breeding some time. They are very lovely, about
as big in body as a Jackdaw, black head, neck, and chest and the
rest is bright Rickett's blue with a deep orange-red bill, legs, and
feet and a wicked straw-coloured eye. The bird I am writing of is
very fond of undoing one's bootlaces and is always playing with
bits of string, stick, or stones. They are a lovely sight in flight with
their long blue tails, white-tipped, streaming out behind them.
The hen is a very tame bird and loves to be picked up and nursed,
and have her head scratched. The cock is not quite so tame, and
is absolutely wild if a stranger is about.
The last bird I shall write about is a very large " bluish "
Green Glossy Starling from Kenya. This bird, like the Hangnest,
is a killer, and I have given up all idea of ever finding a hen that
he will not immediately do his best to kill. I do not exactly know
which Glossy Starling he is, there are so many of them, but he is
certainly the biggest one I have ever clapped eyes on. He is
extremely tame, having been hand-reared, and has complete
liberty some time during the day, but as he fights with the Hangnest
they cannot be let loose together. He is very affectionate and will
follow me about and come when called and what is more important
go into his aviary when told to ! One very curious thing happened
to him and I am glad to say I have two witnesses of this, or I feel
I should be looked upon with grave suspicion as it sounds like an

G. FALKNER-TAME BIRDS AT LIBERTY
American fishing story ! One day this summer he was on top of
the aviaries when a gale got up, he was blown away, and was
missing for four days ; well, I thought, that's the end of that. Twice
he was reported as having been seen a long way from home. One
day I was motoring and got out to speak to a friend on the road.
My friend was talking to me when he suddenly said, " Don't
move, but turn round slowly, a Kingfisher or something like it has
flown on to a post behind you." I turned round and it was my
Starling. I can only conclude that it was most extraordinary
luck that he had either heard my voice or seen me and came
straight to me. He was very soon put in the car and taken home.
Since this experience I have never let any of my birds out in a high
wind, and certainly "Jumbo ", as the bird is called, never comes
out of his aviary when it is very windy ; I think it has taught him
a lesson he won't forget. I am afraid this has been a long-winded
affair, all about four birds, which probably, with the exception
of the Japanese Starling (which happens to be an extremely rare
bird in spite of his dull plumage), everyone who reads this has kept.
I may say that all my birds have a good insectivorous mixture which
I make myself, or rather my cook makes, various fruit ad lib., and
minced raw beef or mutton twice a week, and most of them seem
to survive this diet for a great many years, so I conclude it must
agree with them.

KINGFISHERS IN CAPTIVITY
THEIR REARING AND BREEDING

By Dr. Oskar Heinroth
When, with my first wife, I was writing and illustrating the
four-volumed work, Die Vogel Mitteleuropas (" The Birds of Central
Europe "), we naturally also had to rear and keep the indigenous
Kingfisher (.Alcedo atthis ispida). We came into possession of some
young birds about five days old (see illustration No. 2), taken
from a hole in the earth, which were already somewhat stiff.
Unfortunately through overheating the incubator into which we
first of all put them, they came to grief. They were completely
naked, consequently without any down, their skin was rose-
coloured, the upper mandible, as in the Woodpecker's, was some-
what shorter than the lower, and the eyes and ears were still closed.
Later a friend brought us a nest dug out in the neighbourhood of
Berlin, full of young birds, the age of which it was naturally not
possible to estimate with any exactitude. They were within a week
of leaving the nest, but still had the characteristic feather-sheaths
of Kingfishers, which gives them the appearance of hedgehogs.
In order to provide them with the most natural conditions possible
we put them in a flower pot and then placed this inside a cardboard
case with a tube (see illustration No. 1), so they remained in dark-
ness and were calm.

They soon arranged themselves in such a way, as photograph
No. 3 shows, that always one of them lay with its beak towards
the tube entrance. If we opened the roof of the covering so that the
light penetrated, they at once cowered down nervously ; but if we
darkened the entrance of the tube by holding a hand in front of it
we immediately heard a " Ruerr ruerr ruerr " note like that of the
Black Woodpecker, and the foremost bird was ready to take the
small fish which we inserted with forceps. Then he shouldered his
way back and made room for his next brother or sister. At every
feed a circular movement took place in order that every single bird
should obtain food in turn. It was the same with excretion which
took place from the flower-pot ne$t out through the tube, as can be
seen by the white flecks on the paper lying before it. When digging
out the original nest-hole it was found that the fluid excrement
had drained as far as about the centre of the entrance tunnel,
which of course in nature was much longer.
These young birds had already attained their maximum weight
of 35 gm. ; in other species of birds also the same phenomenon
occurs, that before leaving the nest they are as heavy, or even
heavier than the adult birds. Small fish were taken if one touched
one side of their beaks. Their eyes were already partly
open, but looked quite dim-sighted and the birds blinked a great
deal. The six birds consumed, in about two to three hourly feeds,
a daily total of 150-160 gm. of small fish. Shortly before leaving the
nest their voices turned to a " Zipp ", which sounded like a sneezing
bird cough. Gradually our charges became accustomed to being
fed from above which was naturally more convenient for us. The
scales and bones of the fish were ejected as castings.
Three days before the birds flew the feather-sheaths fell off
and the youngsters now looked complete Kingfishers. They left the
nest through the tube one immediately after the other as if shot out
of a gun, and immediately perched methodically on surrounding
objects. From the beginning they struck the fish now offered them
on a branch in order to place them in the right position, that is to
say head foremost, for swallowing. Also they immediately became
hostile towards each other. A few days later they plunged into a
tub after living fish like true Kingfishers. Unfortunately they soon
became wet so that we were afraid of their drowning, and we
therefore kept them in cage without water. As is well known,

one frequently has the same experience with Dippers ( Cinclus)
and also Diving Ducks ( Fuligulina ) which are reared from the egg.
Besides the familiar " Tit-tit " or " Zih-ih ", which was also
heard in the room when the birds were in flight, we sometimes
noticed a peculiar creaking, grunting noise, which certainly indi-
cated angry excitement, if one put one's hand in the cage. In a
room which they knew well these young foster-children of ours
were quite tame with us and liked to perch on us ; yet if we took
them into another room they became, like many stupid birds,
quite changed--blustered about and dashed against the window
panes, a thing they so easily learnt not to do in the bird-room. They
like best to take their food in flight from our hands.
To keep Kingfishers requires great care, it is not sufficient to
feed them once or twice a day, they must be attended to every two
hours and care must be taken that they do not get dirty and
contract disease of the feet. As they seldom clean their beaks it is
necessary to mb these up and down with a wet rag.
A grown Kingfisher requires on an average 20 gm. of fish and
a number of kitchen cockroaches (Blatta germanica) or meal-
worms a day. If he is left hungry for long he will swallow 10 gm.
of fish straight off, but then has had enough for a time. In photo-
graph No. 5 is shown how large a fish may be for a Kingfisher to
gulp straight down ; the tip of the tail of the prey then of course still
protrudes for some time out of the bird's beak.
In 1932 Herr Garniel, of Vienna, succeeded in breeding King-
fishers in a very large flight room with running water as well as a
pooh He obtained some young birds as they flew from their nest-
hole, a pair of which mated after they had killed their brothers and
sisters ; for these birds are (especially during the breeding season)
exceedingly hostile towards strangers. A full report of this is given
in the Gefiederte Welt (" Feathered World ") of 1932, and I will
here only briefly repeat the results. The male and female first
perched on the ground together and demonstrated their affection
for each other by symbolic nest-building ; then they suddenly
selected a mound of earth of about the height of a man, in which,
taking turns to dig, they excavated a tunnel. The earth was
loosened with the beak and thrown out behind with a kicking
movement of the legs. Male and female took equal shares and did
the same with the incubation, in fact each bird sat for about to

<bodyText confidence="0.9760192" page_id="56322612"  page_num="36" year="" vol="">
remained longer on the eggs than the female, and in one case two
turns of brooding were made successively, whereby the male then
almost exclusively undertook the rearing of the first chicks. The
length of the incubation period, so far as this can be determined
from the conduct of the adult birds, appears to amount to eighteen
days. During the first days the young were only fed on quite small
fish. They flew on the 29th day, at first being very disturbed and
wild, and after a further week became quite independent. If they
were left with their parents they would be murdered after a few
months.

{Continued from p. 75)
Volume V, which commenced in November, 1898, begins with
an article on the breeding of the Chinese Painted Quail by
E. G. B. Meade-Waldo. I had myself very nearly succeeded with
this delightful species, but Meade-Waldo was the first actually to
rear young. Both he and I found no difficulty with this species when
given a good-sized run in which the grass was allowed to grow, and
to my mind a pair of these diminutive Quails with their brood of
six or seven fluffy chicks, little larger than big bumble-bees, is the
most attractive sight in a garden aviary.
Both the Rev. C. D. Farrar and the Rev. H. D. Astley describe
the breeding of the Virginian Cardinal, the latter referring to a
pair of birds which had full liberty in a large garden.
A special show of British and Foreign birds and hybrids was
held at the Crystal Palace on October, 1898, which was notable in
consisting of British and foreign birds and hybrids only, and
marked " the emancipation of the exhibiting aviculturists from the
bondage of the Canary ' fancy 5 to which they had hitherto been
subject The different groups are reported on by various authors.
Parrots by F. G. Dutton, Foreign Finches by C. S. Simpson, Doves
and soft-billed birds by Hubert D. Astley, and British birds by
myself. Several Swallows were shown in one class and on this subject

D. SETH-SMITH-EARLY YEARS OF AVIGULTURAL SOCIETY 37
I made the following remarks : " Swallows always look miserable
and sadly out of place in cages, and it is satisfactory to find that the
judge did not encourage the capture of a bird so perfectly adapted
to a life in the air and so hopelessly miserable in captivity." This
was followed by further protests by other members, and it is
satisfactory to find that Swallows are rarely seen at bird shows
nowadays.
In March, 1899, appeared an interesting article by Meade-
Waldo on " The Ages to which Birds attain in Confinement ".
He believed that, under favourable conditions of food and
surroundings, they would live longer than in the wild state, where,
as they get old, they are beaten by the vigorous younger members
of their species. He mentions a pair of Trumpeter Bullfinches which
he caught himself in the island of Fuertaventura in February, 1888.
These bred at intervals until 1897, when they must have been ten
years old ; " then they suddenly took it into their heads to go
ahead in a most amazing manner. They had four nests and reared
no less than twenty-two young ones, hatching every egg and rearing
each young--this latter operation being rendered much easier for
the parents, by the young of each nest going up and feeding their
younger brethren while in the nest, and after they had left."
The chief contributors to Volume V were A. G. Butler,
C. D. Farrar, H. R. Fillmer, Reginald Phillipps and myself, but I
must not omit to mention an important article by W. H. St. Quintin
on the subject of Eider Ducks in Captivity. He found great
difficulty at first in arriving at the best diet suited to these birds,
but after many trials, came to the conclusion that barley meal,
mixed with Spratts 5 poultry meal, moistened so as to form large
pellets, or balls, with a small quantity of fresh ox or rabbit liver
daily, was sufficient to keep them in the best of health when once
they were accustomed to it. For the young, however, he found
earthworms essential--in fact they would look at nothing else,
though by degrees they could be trained to the diet that answered
for the adults. An interesting observation was that the duck never
left the nest during the twenty-eight days of incubation and in one
case became quite grown over by a mass of chickweed.

fly close to the aviary of one of these birds and, in the early spring,
reports appeared in the press of the much too early arrival of the
Cuckoo in the Hereford district !
The first arrival of the Derbyan Parrakeet in the Zoological
Gardens is recorded. Previous to this the species was only known
from an example which lived in the Knowsley aviaries prior to
1850. The species has become comparatively common in more
recent years. Meade-Waldo records the successful breeding in his
aviaries of the Scops Owl (Scops giu). He found the species
difficult to start in confinement as they require 46 the most
astonishing supply of insects and other tender food ", but after
a time they seemed to get hardier and, with proper food, thrived.
They became very tame with those they knew, but the sight of a
Stranger would transform them at once into what appeared to
be broken-off pieces of wood with its rough bark. 44 This is
done," he says, 44 by quickly, and almost imperceptibly, drawing
all their feathers tight to the body, standing very upright, drawing
the shoulder of the wing next to the supposed enemy half
across the breast, elevating the ear-tufts, and almost shutting the
eyes." Two pairs nested and reared young and it was found that
the hen did not commence to sit until the completion of the clutch,
differing from the generality of Owls ; and the incubation was the
shortest period for any Owl, namely twenty-four days.
There are four coloured plates in Volume V, depicting the
Rufous-tailed Grassfinch, the Blue Sugar-birds, the American
Siskin (Chrysomitris tristis ), and the Princess of Wales's Parrakeet,
all by P. J. Smit and reproduced by the chromo-lithographic
process. Volumes VI and VII are edited by Mr. O. E. Cresswell.
By the end of 1899 the membership was 263 and the subscription
only 1 os. a year, but in spite of the small membership and income,
the Society managed to produce a magazine that was very much
alive, a fact that is evident from the number of contributors and
extent of the correspondence. Volume VI contained four coloured
plates depicting the Sacred Kingfisher and Masked and Long-
tailed Grassfinches by myself, the Spotted Panther Bird (.Pardolotus
punctatus) by Norman B. Roberts, and the Bearded Tit by
F. W. Frohawk, all being hand-coloured lithographs.

Notes on Ecuador 55 by Walter Goodfellow, " The Feeding of
Parrots 55 by the Hon. and Rev. F. D. Dulton, and " Notes on the
St. Vincent Parrot " by Mrs. H. L. Thompson, who had spent five
years in the island.
Meade-Waldo's experience with Gouldian Finches was a much
happier one than that of most people who have kept these birds.
He writes : " Without pretending to have discovered how to manage
these little birds, I may say that since I procured one pair, five years
ago, I have found them the hardiest and most prolific of small
birds. I put them out in the perfectly open aviary in April, where
they moult, and commence to breed in the end of August or
beginning of September, and I bring them in about the middle of
November--not that they appear to feel the cold at all. Last
autumn the original old pair hatched two clutches of six and reared
them all. When rearing their young, I cannot detect that the old
birds eat anything but hard seed, although at other times they are
very fond of grass seed and of pulling out the young shoots of grass
on the lawn and eating the succulent ends."
This and subsequent volumes contained many articles by the
Rev. C. D. Farrar, a very successful aviculturist and most
entertaining writer. Mr. Fillmer made a proposal to extend the
scope of the magazine by throwing it open to papers on rare or
foreign mammals, reptiles, and fishes, discussed from the point of
view of the keeper of living animals. He further suggested the
removal of the ban on Canaries, considering their exclusion
" unscientific and absurd ". This led to a good deal of discussion
in the correspondence columns, almost all the writers being opposed
to the idea.
Volume VII, which commenced in November, 1900, contains
two hand-coloured plates, one by Goodchild of Bouquet's Amazon
Parrot, the other of the Cape Sparrow (Passer arcuatus ) by myself.
Bouquet's Parrot is one of the rare island forms of Amazona (formerly
Chrysotis ), inhabiting the island of Dominica, and is dealt with,
together with the other rare Parrot of that island, Amazona
imperialis, which was then known as Chrysotis augusta , by Canon
Dutton.
There are several valuable articles in this volume, notably by
St. Quintin and Meade-Waldo. In reporting upon the breeding
season of 1900, St. Quintin describes the nesting of his Snowy

Owls, then more than nine years old. The first egg was laid on
26th May, and the first young bird appeared on 29th June. Two
fine young, one of either sex, were safely reared. He writes : 44 I
hope that, if any of my fellow-members acquire any of these fine
birds they will be careful in regard to food. With Eagle Owls one
can take great liberties, either as to quantity or quality. But it is
not so with the far more delicate 4 Snowies They must have what
falconers call 4 castings ' at every meal, that is fur and small bones.
The only easily obtained food that seems to suit these birds perfectly
is rabbit, and it must be fresh and not tainted in the least or the
Owls will go amiss. They will not eat birds in confinement, at least
that is my experience, though when at liberty it is otherwise ; and
they are said to feed on Ptarmigan, etc., and sometimes even on
fish. 55 Meade-Waldo also contributes a good article on Owls which
were great favourites of his, and he stresses the great importance of
giving only perfectly fresh food with the fur or feathers. 44 The
health of the individual can always be gauged, 55 he writes, 44 by
the condition of its castings, viz. the indigestible portion of its last
meal which is ejected the following day. The healthy castings should
consist of the fur or feathers and bones alone , tightly wrapped. If
sloppy, or with portions of undigested meat, the bird is not well. 55
St. Quintin describes the breeding of the Roller in captivity in
the number for October, 1901. The birds nested in a large hollow
log, and young were heard calling for food on the 2nd July. The
birds were kept well supplied with mealworms, gentles, and such
beetles as could be collected, as well as their ordinary mixture of
rabbit, chopped up with the fur and small bones, mice and hard-
boiled egg.
With Volume VIII (commencing in November, 1901) my
term of editorship began, and we were able to enlarge the size of
the magazine. Seven coloured plates, six by Herbert Goodchild
and one by Astley, were published, those by Goodchild being
particularly successful. They figure the Parrot Finch, European
Bee-eater, August Amazon, now known as the Imperial Parrot,
Brown's Parrakeet, Blue-winged Siva, and St. Lucia Parrot (.Amazona
versicolor). Several photographic illustrations and a black-and-
white drawing of the Australian Crane by Frohawk are included.
The list of contributors to this volume is a long one, and space will
only allow of my mentioning a few of the more important articles.

Astley writes on the nesting in captivity of the Australian Crane,
Bonhote on the breeding of the Spotted Eagle Owl, Canon Dutton
deals with rare Amazon Parrots, Farrar describes the breeding of
the Many-coloured Parrakeet and of the Cat Bird, Dr. W. T. Greene
treats of the Hawk-headed Parrot, and Mfs. Johnstone describes
the breeding of the Black-headed Conure and Barnard's Parrakeet.
But the most prolific writer of all was the late Reginald Phillipps,
who was a tower of strength to the Magazine at the time and his
success in the breeding of the Australian Blue Wren (Malurus cyaneus)
was an outstanding achievement. Every Australian, or visitor to
the eastern states of that country, must know this exquisite little
bird, of which the cock, when in colour, is a perfect gem. It is rare
enough in European aviaries and not too easy to import, but
Reginald Phillipps was lucky enough to obtain a cock and two
hens.
I mentioned in the previous article that Phillipps's aviary
consisted of his whole back garden, enclosed with wire netting.
It was not a large garden, no more than the ordinary plot allotted
to small houses in a West London street, but planted thickly with
shrubs and grass it made a very good flight for birds. The back
room on the ground floor was known as the bird-room and
communicated with the flight, while from a semi-basement window
below a good view of the flight could be obtained. Mr. Phillipps
had noticed one of the hen Blue Wrens carrying hay to a spot
amongst some Virginia Creeper stalks, just such a place as an
English Wren might have selected, but thought no more of it until,
on the 26th July, hearing some unfamiliar baby voice, he searched.
On a long thin cane, fixed horizontally in the aviary, he beheld a
tiny mite, of a very light brown colour, being assiduously attended
to by a pair of Blue Wrens, one on either side, who every few seconds
disappeared and returned with some invisible speck which it
dropped into the open mouth of the youngster. I had the pleasure
a short time after of seeing this young bird with its parents. It was
successfully reared and for four years regularly developed the
seasonal breeding plumage of the male of this species. On its death
in 1906 Mr. Phillipps sent me its body, and it now reposes in my
cabinet.

By E. N. T. Vane
Dr. Hopkinson, in his " Breeding Records 33 published in the
November issue of the Society&amp;apos;s Magazine, states that he has no
record for Bauer&amp;apos;s Parrakeets in the United Kingdom ; conse-
quently my experience with these birds may be of interest to others,
and in any event will give a definite instance of successful rearing
of the species in England.
Having disclosed the end of my story at the commencement
may have removed most of the interest and displayed my lack of
the author&amp;apos;s craft. But to continue, I have kept Bauer&amp;apos;s for some
three years. The first pair I had were fine large birds, always in
excellent health and condition and ever ready for a good scrap in
the true Broadtail tradition ; in my opinion they are the most
handsome of the more soberly clad Parrakeets. This particular
pair appeared to live in a state of armed neutrality, explained by
subsequent events which proved them to be two cocks. I should
have discovered this earlier, but they had been selected as a true
pair by an eminent authority ; moreover, to all outward appear-
ances they were a cock and a hen. One is far more massively built
and has a distinctly larger and wider head, while the other is
slimmer generally and always perches in a more upright position,
which accentuates the difference. However, they are both cocks,
as one is the father of several fine youngsters, and the other, in
spite of his feminine appearance, has been feeding and mating
with a young hen ; but owing to " summer " being in March
this year, the pair of them fell into a moult in the " autumn " in
May, thus effectively postponing breeding operations for this
season.
All my Parrakeets are kept in 21 ft. flights, one pair to
a flight. The floors are of grass which is re turfed annually, and in
addition a number are kept vacant and limed and salted whilst
resting for a few months. I would like to rest them more, but
accommodation has to be found for the young stock and, further,
so long as I have an empty aviary I find it almost impossible to say
</bodyText>

E. N. T. VANE-BREEDING BAUER's PARRAKEETS IN UNITED KINGDOM 43
" No " when Opportunity knocks with the offer of some greatly
desired pair of birds which will never recur, so the flight being
temporarily rested becomes temporarily occupied. My latest
aviaries are movable, which overcomes the latter temptation,
and in any case those on fixed sites have only been in their present
position for two years, and some of them are less than a year old.
Wire netting of J in. mesh covers the whole of the floor of
the aviaries underneath the top layer of turf, to exclude rats, stoats,
etc. My grandfather clock nest-boxes are constructed with a
protruding base about 4 inches wide all round the foot, with
an aperture about 6 inches square in the middle, the boxes
therefore stand in the flight and are braced to the sides ; but the
important point is that the whole of the nest is in direct contact
with the earth. The drinking bowls are placed close to the foot
of the nest, and in replenishing these care is taken to soak the
surrounding earth thoroughly, particularly in dry weather. The
nest-box is filled with earth, turf, and peat mould to about 4 feet
of its height, and the remaining 2 feet is left for the birds to
climb down the netting inside. An inspection trap is provided
for emergency only (but it is sometimes used when I am totally
overcome by worry or curiosity, if I know the birds well) just
above the level of the nest proper. I find the hen digs down a long
way into this before she is really satisfied and will start her clutch.
" Nothing venture, nothing win," is quite a suitable axiom for
an aviculturist, so in my optimism I decided to open the nests early
so that there would be plenty of time for a second round. The
weather was fine and warm, in fact it was too dry if anything, and
although no first nest had been started here was I already thinking
about the second. Had the Bauer's been thought readers I fear they
would have formed a very low opinion of my mind, but it would
have been " the pot calling the kettle black " as they were in
the nest the day it was opened, and very pleased to be there, too,
judging by their behaviour. Within ten days the first egg was
laid, and this was still in March.
As I always feed and look after my birds personally, they
knew me well and took scarcely any notice of my presence, yet
strangers always annoyed the cock. His disturbed manner was
not so much nervousness as real anger ; he would fly up and down
the aviary and cling to the wires whistling out his defiance fiercely.

44 E. N. T. VANE-BREEDING BAUER's PARRAKEETS IN UNITED KINGDOM
The Bauer's call is quite musical in the open, but very penetrating,
and when he keeps on with his repeated single note for twenty or
thirty times without stopping everyone in the neighbourhood
knows something is wrong. He was far more effective than a watch-
dog, and I used to wonder if the Twenty-eight Parrakeet, his near
relative, was named thus because he kept on calling twenty-eight
times in succession. I only examine the nests when I am certain
no objection is likely to be taken, and after seeing an egg I refrain
from any further interference unless something is obviously amiss.
In this case I have no doubt the birds would not have resented my
inquisitiveness, but I did not try the experiment; certainly I could
not help, so why risk doing harm. I am confident that, in spite
of the many cases I have read about where eggs are inspected
daily and even soaked to assist incubation, it is best never to look
in. Unless you have been blessed with the gift of patience by
nature it takes years to reach this stage of aviculture.
Everything proceeded according to plan--the cock had been
feeding the hen before the nest was opened, and immediately this
had been inspected by both and duly approved they were seen
to pair. Having once seen the first egg it was not very difficult
to curb my impatience and curiosity as there was absolutely no
cause for anxiety. Every evening regularly about six o'clock the
cock used to alight on the nest platform, put his head inside the
hole, and call his mate off to feed and take exercise. She put in
some ten minutes of physical jerks and he had a nice meal all
ready for her, so that everything was obviously going along nicely.
About the middle of April the unmistakable hissing of young
Parrakeets was heard ; I first noticed it about eleven o'clock at night,
when feeding my dogs. The hen was still brooding closely, being
very little in evidence, and the cock did not start feeding the
young direct, at least I never saw him enter the nest for another
week or more. The hen then came off more frequently, and they
were both busy providing for the family. Incubation had taken
about three weeks, but I cannot be more definite than that.
When eventually a stealthy inspection was made, there were two
youngsters with the quills of their feathers just sprouting and one
unhatched egg. This was left until the young were fledged and
flown, as I would not put my hand inside the box. In the middle
of this visit both the parents came out of the shelter where they

had been feeding and caught me red-handed, but they were not
in the least perturbed, and did not even rush in after my hasty
exit to discover what damage I had done to their precious offspring ;
they just finished their meal and usual exercise before settling down
once more.
Their food throughout the year consists of a mixture of sunflower,
hemp, oats, groats, mammoth canary, and white millet, with a few
peanuts and continuous supply of sweet red apples. During the
breeding season this is augmented by a liberal supply of seeding
grasses, wild green food such as milk thistle, dandelion, groundsel,
chickweed, and spinnach beet. As a matter of fact they would
eat almost anything and took potato, carrot, and even tomato ;
they also collected earthworms from around the drinking bowl
and broke them up, apparently to feed to the young. Having
noticed this I supplied mealworms, which they ignored. Perches
were renewed fairly frequently, as the birds when breeding soon
stripped off all leaves, buds, and bark. Millet sprays were used
at the rate of one per day ; sprouted sunflower, hemp, and oats
were supplied daily together with soaked stale brown bread squeezed
dry, and they consumed a large quantity of these two items. Millet
sprays are not supplied out of the breeding season and very little
canary or white millet is taken. The birds seem to prefer sunflower,
hemp, and oats, so when replenishing their feeding bowls I always
put the three favourite seeds in first and then cover them over with
canary and millet ; neither do I refill the bowls until some of the
less favoured seeds have been taken, to vary the diet so that it should
not be too fattening. Of course, when breeding they have an
unrestricted choice of anything they fancy.
The two young birds, which were only slightly smaller and a
little duller in coloration than their parents, left the nest together
on the same day. They could be easily distinguished by the lighter
shade of the beaks and the nestling down which still showed through
their plumage ; they were quite strong on the wing from the first
but not so expert in alighting. Although they are now seven months
old they are still with their parents and are most difficult to pick
out; at least many of my friends to whom I have pointed out
the difference fail to see it, but the yellow on the young birds'
bellies is washed over with bottle-green, which is fading away.
My hopes of a second nest were frustrated, as the cock started to

moult in June and was soon joined by the hen; this is the reason that
the young have been able to remain in the same flight as the old
birds. They are quite a happy family, and will insist on roosting
in the open without any cover ; they hang on the wire netting in
close formation of fours. I have not been too insistent in stopping
this folly as yet, but they must change their site soon, as they will
be separated for the good of their health.
I have not included a description of the Bauer as it must be
familiar to most, but the contrast between the yellow front and dark
green back which is set off by the black head and yellow collar
make a very attractive bird and I should not like to be without
them. At present I have three pairs.
They are most difficult to sex with certainty, but in the adult
birds this may be done by the underside of the wing. A cock is
entirely black, but the hen has about seven or eight feathers with
white spots on them which form a bar when the wing is extended.
Young immature birds, however, seem to possess this bar to some
extent whatever the sex. I have proved that the birds with smaller
heads and slimmer appearance are not always hens, as mentioned
earlier, and the so-called hen, which turned out to be a cock
when examined, had no bar of white. Further, this indication
of sex has held good in all the Bauer's I have examined so, although
it may not be infallible, it has never failed me yet.
Perhaps many of the details here recorded appear unnecessary,
but I remember that when I first started keeping Parrakeets
innumerable difficulties were encountered which were never referred
to by the experts in their books. They had forgotten all about them
when they found out that they were not due to extraordinary
behaviour, but were normal procedure. Perhaps, therefore,
in the hope that they may be of some little assistance to a few,
if not all, who may read, I may be forgiven for alluding to them.
Those who are wearied by these superfluous incidents will in any
case most probably never get so far as reading this apology which
I offer to conclude my notes on " Breeding Bauer's Parrakeets
in the United Kingdom ".

By Dr. Maurice Amsler, F.Z.S.
The year 1938 has been a quixotic one for breeders of birds and
plants alike.
The summer-like weather of March deceived most of us and
those who keep their more delicate birds in a sheltered room during
the cold months were tempted to turn them out into their aviaries
too early.
The birds were equally deceived and very quickly began to
think of nesting, only to receive a nasty shock when the glacial
period came--April and May.
My own experience was a great number of infertile first clutches.
These climatic conditions affected not only the small Passerines
but also the eggs of some of the game birds, which at first showed
a low fertility, a condition which greatly improved as the spring
frosts ceased to trouble us. November was one of the warmest
on record and tempted me to leave the more delicate birds in the
unheated aviaries till too late a date, with the result that I had a few
casualties. Fortunately these were only among the commoner
Waxbills which I keep to fill the voids of my somewhat sparsely
populated aviaries. A hen Painted Finch [Emblema picto), however,
was accidentally overlooked and not spotted until after the thaw
which followed Christmas. This little bird, which almost always
roosts on the ground in the open flight, had perfectly withstood a
constant frost of several days, as low as 20* F. and a foot of snow.
When I caught her up she seemed none the worse for her arctic
surroundings.
The happiest days in the avicultural year are those when the
birds which have been caged for the winter are liberated in their
spick and span breeding quarters, and to me the most disagree-
able task is the catching-up when the short dark days return.
Softbills are easily trapped by means of a few mealworms--
and some of the seed-eaters will at once succumb to millet-spray,
sunflower seed, or apple, but always there will be a few wary
customers who must be caught by means of that abomination--
the net. May I again remind all bird-keepers only to use a net in
which the ring has been well padded with a thick covering of

tow or cotton-wool. If the bird comes in contact with a hard
wooden or iron ring he runs a great chance of being killed outright.
As to actual breeding results :--
Two pairs of Red-headed Parrot Finches laid and incubated in
April, eggs all clear. A second attempt in warmer weather resulted
in two broods of strong youngsters. What a pity these birds are
so difficult to sex. I am ashamed to admit that this is quite beyond
me. Even if one has time to cage birds separately, song on the part
of any particular bird merely denotes that it is a male ; its absence
unfortunately does not prove that one has a female.
I must admit to having sought the aid of a breeder who is
much cleverer than I am. In 1937 all my young stock was sent to
him and was correctly sexed--early this year I again sent him my
young birds, only four or five on this occasion, and he was mistaken
in every case but one !

always disappoint me in the early months of the year--they build
feverishly for a few days, then just as one expects eggs the nest-box
is found empty and the nest entirely demolished.
Both pairs behaved in exactly the same way and did so last
year ; but in July, very much to my surprise, one pair produced
four young. A neat globular nest had been built in a Lonicera nitida
and the hen had been sitting for a few days on a clutch of six.
One day I noticed that there were three Parrot Finches in the
neighbouring aviary and stupidly did not realize what had
happened until the morrow when I found the nest deserted and the
eggs cold. I soon trapped the truant and replaced her in her
lawful home ; she at once returned to the nest and hatched out
five young, of which four were fully reared. In November three
more young left the nest and successfully weathered several frosts
before being brought into warmer quarters.
The hen of this pair is something of a matriarch, if that term
can be applied to an old hen. I bought her from Mr. Mayer in
July, 19335 an d she was then apparently quite an adult.
The other pair did not mend their evil ways and produced
no young.
Cuban Finches and Green Avadavats both produced young
from nowhere--by which I mean that I did not know that they had
a nest or were sitting. The former species cannot abide any curiosity

on the part of their owner, so it is perhaps as well that my aviaries
are thickly planted and that they can breed in secrecy. Two
species of Niltava, the Lesser and Rufous-bellied, both disappointed
me ; in each case I had the misfortune to lose the male during
the breeding season--though it must be admitted that I saw no
signs of nesting.
Orange-headed Ground Thrushes reared two broods of two
young ; on each occasion the chicks were true pairs--the sex being
recognizable to an experienced eye before they leave the nest.
This is, I think, the ninth successive season these birds have
produced young in my aviaries. They have never reared more than
five or less than two--but, alas, the old cock was picked up dead
this autumn. At the age of over nine years I thought that a verdict
of death from natural causes was justifiable without the interven-
tion of the Coroner in the person of Mr. Hicks. Diamond Doves
as usual went on nesting until the severe frosts of December either
froze their eggs or killed the callow young. The Jobi Island or
White-fronted Doves have been less prolific this year and I have
to blame a pair of Tragopans for killing at least two squabs of
this species shortly after they left the nest. All keepers of Doves
will have bred Doves which left the nest a little prematurely ;
these flutter around on the ground for the first few days, and it is
possible that Pheasants look upon the ground floor of their aviary
as their own particular domain. A pair of the rather new Dwarf
Cardinals or Black-crested Finch (Lophospingus pusillus) arrived
here in May. In the June, 1938, number of the Magazine,
Dr. Hopkinson quoting the B.M. Catalogue says " the hen is similar
to the male only slightly smaller ". This is incorrect, the difference
in size is not noticeable ; but the sexes are distinguishable at a
glance, the " blacks 55 in the male are a very dark brown, whereas
in the female the dark areas are a rusty brown, moreover she lacks
the black bib which is quite a feature in the male. These appear
to be inoffensive and in a quiet way very attractive little birds--
one member has already had a partial breeding success with this
species. My own pair only got as far as a nest built in a Weigelia ,
it was a very small cup-shaped affair of such exquisite workman-
ship that any Chaffinch might easily have been roused to jealousy.
I have now obtained a second pair. Shamas were disappointing ;
one pair built but did not lay--the other laid but the hen is so fond

of waiting for my approach that the eggs must have been chilled
many times over and were consequently all clear. She made no
further attempt. It is only in exceptional cases that the male of
this species can be trusted to feed the young, and it is therefore
a safer plan to cage him inside the aviary as soon as the eggs hatch.
Blue Robins were rather disappointing ; I had two cocks and one
hen of the commoner Eastern variety and a cock and two hens of
the Western. The Eastern hen was a very old bird and did no good.
She has since died and was reported to be " in a healthy condition,
death due to old age ". One of the Western hens was inclined to
sneeze and sputter ever since her arrival here two years ago,
so I mated her to a spare Eastern cock ; the latter soon began to
feed her and I expected great things, but both her clutches of eggs
were perfectly clear. Meantime the season was becoming advanced
and a beautiful Western hen properly mated to a fine cock of the
same species showed no sign of going to nest.
Finally in desperation I took away her mate and put him in the
aviary with " Sneezy ".
Things began to move at once, and within a fortnight there
were three eggs in the nest-box (previous nests had consisted of
four and five eggs).
Of these three eggs two hatched and both the chicks were fully
reared, but only by taking the risk of giving the parents their
liberty. This is, of course, a dangerous proceeding with valuable
birds, but a very fascinating one nonetheless ; also barring
accidents you can be almost certain of rearing all the young--
whereas in my aviaries I always know that all my young Bluebirds
will, after the first few days--either gradually die, or disappear.
During the liberty period, the hen's sneezing became alarmingly
pronounced, so I trapped her and gave her four drops of Aniodol
( interne ), a French remedy in great favour at Cleres.
At first I thought she was about to expire, so picked her up and
put her in her aviary, but after an hour or so she appeared to have
completely recovered, and marvellous to relate I have not heard
a sneeze from that day to this.
I had treated this hen for gapeworm with other remedies on
several occasions with no apparent result, and I cannot imagine
one dose of medicine curing any chronic disease unless it were
parasitic.

By great good fortune I have been able to exchange one of these
young Western hens for a cock of the same species, so now have
two pairs of these rare birds, and a recent importation has enabled
me to buy an Eastern hen for one of my Eastern cocks, both of
which were bred here in 1937.
In the matter of game birds I am still much of a tyro and am
not sufficiently bitten to indulge in incubators and electrically
heated brooders.
The species reared here this year were Edward's, Peacock
Pheasants, and Amhersts (twenty of the latter).
A lovely pair of Sonnerat's Junglefowl were late-comers in
immature plumage and also a pair of Satyr Tragopans, the male
of which arrived with a broken wing. By dint of a piece of surgery
of which I am very proud he has made a complete recovery. So
much so that he has been the death of several small birds, including
the Jobi Doves mentioned earlier in these notes. The latest
Pheasant arrivals here are a pair of Mikados.
I see Miss Chawner complains of a great excess of male birds in
the Pheasants reared at Leckford. I have had the same experience
here, always cocks when I wanted hens--but an exception must be
made in the case of the Edward's. Both in England and on the
Continent a great proportion of the birds reared have been hens ;
here again I was in the same quandary. I wanted a cock for an
unmated adult hen, and never bred a single one, nor could I find
one for sale after much advertising and writing.
There is a somewhat risky method of getting over this trouble,
which I shall adopt with very careful supervision.
The two hens are kept in adjacent runs with a communicating
door, and the cock is occasionally driven through so that his
time is about equally divided between the two hens.
I have tried running two hen Edward's with one cock in the
same aviary, with dire results to the newly arrived hen, but the
above method of sharing one cock with two separately caged hens
has been successfully tried by Professor A. Ghigi, with such strictly
monogamous birds as Polyplectrons.
In this particular instance I believe he shared a Grey Peacock
Pheasant ( Chinqui ) between his lawful spouse and a hen Germain,
and that both hens laid fertile eggs.
As this is so, I see no reason why any monogamous species

should not be treated in like manner when one has an excess of
hens--providing always that at the first introduction, someone
stands by armed with a net, in case the feathers begin to fly ; in
most cases one will not have to wait long if the experiment is to be a
failure. The best time to bring the cock and the new hen together is,
of course, at feeding time.

FLYCATCHERS AND HUMMING BIRDS
OF CANADA
By James Cassidy
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997747608695652" page_id="56322628"  page_num="52" year="" vol="">
The Eastern Kingbird is a large, dark grey (almost black)
and white Flycatcher. Frequently during times of excitement
the orange crown-patch, which is seldom seen under ordinary
conditions, becomes vividly visible, the front and under parts show
as pure white, and the head and tail, except the latter's white tip,
become black.
The nest of the Flycatcher is no careless conglomeration of
chance materials, but a selection of weed stalks, grasses, and waste
vegetation, carefully constructed and well lined, with plant-down
rootlets, and fine grasses, the construction being placed in bushes
or trees, sometimes in orchards or near cultivated fields and never
far from water. The bird likes to be near human abodes and is
possessed of a fine spirit, which enables it to keep away Hawks or
Crows, as it never has the slightest hesitation in challenging them
vigorously, emphatically flying at them, its agility and conveniently
small size enabling it to strike its large enemy in any quarter, while
rendering it safe from attacks of birds of heavier build and less
quick movements. Its loud cries give notice of the struggle and
bring watchers readily.
Mr. A. P. Taverner has given an amusing description of the
dodging of Hawk or Crow, to avoid the attack of this gallant
defender of his home and rights. He tells how after it has " driven
away the intruder as far as it sees fit, and demonstrated its

pre-eminence within its own territory, it comes back chattering
with excited triumph, and with a flirt of tail resumes its isolated
outlook on some upstanding twig, as if to await the applause of
its mate and the surrounding community ".
If it appear to be something of a braggart after it has driven
away intruders and would-be wreckers of its home, yet the proper
and able defence of its own is at least commendable, although
maybe, unstressed by modesty of subsequent behaviour. The
Kingbird has not only gallantry and courage, but grace and a
natural simplicity.
Another name applied to it is that of " Bee-Martin The
suggestion implied by this term is that the bird captures honey-bees.
There is a slight measure of truth in this accusation, but a careful
examination of 624 birds 5 stomachs by the U.S.A.'s Department of
Agriculture showed that twenty-two of the entire number contained
a total of sixty-one bees, of which fifty-one were drones, eight
workers, and two indeterminates. Of honey-bees there were
actually none. Many destructive insects and a fraction of wild
fruit and berries were also found.
The most difficult of the Flycatcher family to distinguish apart
from their near relatives is possibly the small greenish variety known
as Eastern Phoebe. Its upper parts are of uniform dull olive green,
a dull white below, devoid of distinctive colour-marks--these are
features of this little bird. Its name " Phoebe " is due to its note,
which is " Phoe-be ", quickly uttered with a strong accent on the
first syllable. It is also distinguished by the sideway sw r eep of the
tail, and the absence of bars on the wings. It loves to haunt
buildings, including bridges and culverts, as well as barns, etc.
Its nest is just a structure of mud, moss, and grasses put
together under bridges or the overhangs of buildings or ledges
of rock.
All over Eastern North America, Canada, and West through
the Prairie Provinces and northward in the woodlands the Phoebe's
little homes are found. The bird is such a friendly mite, frequently
plastering its nest under the family porch. The little creature comes
close to man if a welcome be afforded it. Its confidence is quickly
gained and may be retained by uniform kindness.
We now turn from consideration of a few members of the Fly-
catcher family to that of the Trochilidae, or Humming Birds.

"There is only one family of Humming Birds in Canada, repre-
sented in the East by a single species, in the far West by three, 55
writes Mr. Taverner. This lovely little creature is so tiny that its
entire maximum length is covered by 3I inches. Its bill is about
one-eighth of the length of its body and is spine-shaped. The
colours of the bird have a brilliant metallic sheen.
The Ruby-throated Humming Bird is the only one East and in
the Prairies. As it flies it emits a buzzing sound as of insects. The
male bird shows a lovely rich metallic bronzy green above and on
its sides. Its under parts are dull white with a throat patch, singu-
larly suggestive of a bib, of beautiful rosy red. This last is almost
missing in the hen bird and the youngsters, a few spots, widely
scattered, of ruby being shown. The nest of this beautiful little
creature is a delightful structure, covered with bits of lichen
cemented together with cobweb saddled on the top of a branch.
Although the structure of the Humming Bird is that of a true
bird its methods of flight resemble those of an insect, since it can
fly backwards, forwards, sideways, up or down, or it can remain
stationary in the air quite easily. It is impossible to measure with
any degree of accuracy the rapid vibration of the wings by the
tuning-fork method applied to insects. It is not surprising that,
the method of flight being thoroughly different to that of other
birds, the wings themselves should differ from the usual type.
They are long, narrow, and inflexible, and the lower part of the
breast-bone is immensely deepened to give the necessary support
to the great muscles that move the wings. It has been computed
that " in proportion to its wing-spread a Humming Bird has
a breast-keel nearly three times larger than that of a Pigeon,
a bird of average flight, or forty times larger than that of an
Albatross ".
If one should inquire what is the economic status of this little
bird, the reply is that in all probability it does good out of all
proportion to its size, as it adds to its nectar such substantial
food as minute pollen-eating forms of insect-life and even
minute gnats.
Another of the Humming Bird family--but this time we must
look to the West of North America--is the Calliope Humming
Bird. It is a tiny bird even amongst the small Humming
Birds.

The male of the species is a very brilliant fellow, with his
gleaming violet gorget, long and outstanding on either side, his
rainbow-tinted bronzy green above, his dusky white below, and
his rose-violet throat feathers. He is unmistakable and a lovely
sight to look at. It has been said that the gorget is like the half of
a many pointed star on a white ground, easily recognized as a
distinguishing mark when it faces the observer.
The female is, by comparison with her mate, a homely little
Hummer with rufous flanks.
The nest, as with the ruby-throated bird, is a wonderfully
complete structure of lichens and cobwebs on a branch.
From British Columbia to New Mexico, in Canada, Southern
British Columbia, part of the Alberta foothills and on the coast,
north to Wrangel, Alaska, the black birches, which abound in the
interior valleys of British Columbia, exude a sweet thick sap,
which these tiny creatures much appreciate. The branches of the
tapped trees are black with the exudation, and clouds of Calliopes
and other Humming Birds get to work eagerly on the desirable
nectar. Here is a word-picture of such a muster by Mr. A. P.

" They are peppery, pugnacious little midgets and never meet
each other without a battle of elfin fury. They dash together,
squeaking in fine, high tones, almost above the limit of the ear to
hear, tower into the air, exchange stroke and parry with their
rapier-like bills, and then descend to opposite sides of the bush
under examination, only to meet and engage shortly. None seem
to be seriously damaged by the encounter, but they never learn to
bear or forbear, and a sap-running tree is a centre of rapidly
buzzing wings, thin angry squeaks, and dashing forms, mixing in
constant fray, from which come flashes from gleaming throats of
kaleidoscopic brilliancy. Were Humming Birds as large as their
courage, their haunts would not be safe for anybody."
To conclude this brief paper on a few of the Humming Birds of
Canada's only family it is advisable for the sake of clarity to state
that these tiny birds, with brilliant flower-like coloration, insect-like
flight, and wonderfully varied form, are a typically American
order. Strange indeed are some of the forms they exhibit, including
" crests, ruffs, fans, and muffs, exaggerated tails, long plumes,
and enormous sword-like and fine awl-shaped bills, but their most

striking feature is the brilliant metallic coloration that gleams on
various parts of the body."
The tongue of the Humming Bird is an example of apt design
for the work it is intended to do. Like that of the Woodpecker it
protrudes. It is of exceptional length with its sides " curled over
towards the middle to form a double tube, frayed over into a brush-
like tip that makes a most efficient organ for sucking liquids ".
It is, perhaps, scarcely necessary to state that the nectar is
spiced and flavoured with innumerable small insects which are
presumably necessary to the well-being of the bird. The insects
are minute.

Deciding to try to breed these birds, a pair were placed in an
aviary measuring 26 ft. long by 12 ft. wide and 6 ft. 6 in. high ;
the flight was turfed throughout.
Two nest-boxes were introduced in the flight in March, one
being a small barrel which was placed on the floor of the flight and
the other, a small grandfather clock type, 4 ft. 6 in. high and
18 in. square, was half-filled with decayed wood.
Almost immediately the cock was observed trying to drive the
hen to nest and the birds mated each morning and evening. The
hen entered the grandfather clock nest-box, but eventually laid her
first egg on the floor, which fortunately was not broken.
A pot egg was then put in the nest-box and to my delight the
hen laid her second egg in the nest ; the dummy egg was then taken
away and the first egg replaced. After this the hen laid each evening
until she had laid a full clutch of six eggs, commencing to sit after
she had laid the third egg. About this time mice were noticed in
the flight and the hen deserted the eggs. These being eradicated,

the hen immediately went to nest again, but died after laying
her second egg, egg-bound.
Fortunately I was able to secure another hen and the cock
immediately paired with her, but seemed to treat this second hen
very roughly, chasing her all over the flight, and at one time I was
afraid that he would kill her.
However, after some three to four weeks this hen entered the
nest-box and to my delight laid an egg, but then dashed my hopes by
laying three soft-shelled eggs. She sat the good egg for a month
and then once more I was disappointed as she deserted the nest
and I found a young chick dead in shell.
Disappointed, but not downhearted, I decided to give them
another try and to overcome the previous difficulty, in addition to
the usual liberal supply of grit that all my birds have, I decided to
give this pair lime water in the drinking water.
Again the hen went to nest, and at this juncture I would state
that, in my opinion, the cock bird is the deciding factor, as he gave
her no peace until she entered the nest-box, only allowing her
off for short periods. This time she laid three eggs and allowed me
to inspect the nest through an inspection hole in the side of the
box.
After twenty-four days of sitting I heard the sweetest music
to the aviculturist, squeaking in the nest-box, and to my joy
discovered that she had hatched two youngsters which grew very
rapidly, leaving the nest fully feathered in exactly five weeks from
the time of hatching.
Again Nemesis stepped in and one of the youngsters broke its
neck by flying straight into the netting when it was six weeks old.
During the whole time the birds had unlimited supplies of green
food, consisting of oats in the ear, chickweed, and apples, but took
chiefly to the chickweed, of which they consumed enormous
quantities.
At the time of writing the remaining youngster, a cock, is just
getting his red beak and is a very fine specimen.

As the " records 55 don't amount to much, the emphasis is on
the " rural
During the years when, with very little spare time, I tried to
keep and breed birds in the surroundings of a town I always
yearned for the opportunities which I imagined would be mine if
ever I migrated to the country.
On the realization of that hope I forthwith set about adapting
a large barn as a vermin-proof shelter, capable of accommodating
the many and various species I anticipated being now able to
attend to.
The concrete foundations for the correspondingly large wired
flight were laid at the same time. Those foundations are now grass-
grown, and the projected flight has never been erected.
The reasons for this neglect are twofold.
First, I soon discovered that if the life of a " Country Parson "
is in many ways much less exacting than in a town, it involves a
number of fresh interests--professional and otherwise--the pursuit
of which eat up one's time just as effectively. The life of the country-
dweller may be less strenuous, but it is a complete fallacy to imagine
it is less full of interest and activity.
In practice I have found that, so far from increasing my stock
of birds, I have gradually reduced them by eliminating species
which require special attention, and retaining only those which are,
if necessary, capable of surviving the attentions of an intelligent
gardener.
The other reason is more worthy of being recorded in an
avicultural publication, for I have found by experience that the
smaller foreign hardbills, in which my chief interest has always
lain, so far from requiring a large flight, thrive just as well and
breed all the better without one. *
I am satisfied that for the great majority of such birds the most
satisfactory arrangement consists of a large, airy, and well-lit
shelter with a flight-cage large enough to allow the birds access to
fresh air and rain, but not sufficient to accommodate shrubs or other
nesting sites. This means that all the inmates of one's aviary are
obliged to construct their nests under cover, and so avoid the

mortality which is liable to occur, from thunderstorms and so
forth, to birds nesting in the open.
I need hardly add that such an arrangement would not meet
the requirements of either insectivorous or Parrot-like birds, though
it is quite satisfactory for Doves. In practice I have had my best
breeding results with hardbills housed in an attic, and for that
reason now keep most of my best breeding pairs in such an
44 aviary ", using the converted barn only as an overflow from
there.
The original attic has been adapted by substituting glass for
part of the tiled roof, throwing out a smallish flight-cage from the
window, and carrying up the domestic central-heating system.
Given an abundant supply of fresh green food, including a good
piece of turf, and keeping a bath in the flight-cage in all weathers,
I find the birds housed in this rather primitive 44 aviary 55 thrive
exceedingly and keep in health and condition at least as well as
those outside, while the breeding results are considerably better.
The additional convenience in tending the birds in such an
aviary in bad weather need not be emphasized.
One other apparent advantage of such an arrangement is liable
to prove just the opposite, unless breeding pairs are separated for
some months during the shortest days of winter. Otherwise the
comparative comfort and genial temperature of their aviary is
liable to induce excessive breeding so that the stamina of the parents
is reduced and, of course, such young as are reared are almost
certain to show the effects of that 44 night starvation 55 from which
a certain much-advertised beverage is supposed to provide a
remedy !
Apart from the question of available time, I have suffered
another disillusionment about the avicultural advantages of the
country over the town. It has always been my ambition to keep
birds at liberty or semi-liberty, but such experiments as I had
previously attempted had not been encouraging owing to the
depredations of cats, catapults, and other urban nuisances, coupled
with the restricted garden space.
But I find that in a locality which abounds in such rural pests
as gamekeepers, Owls, and stoats I have only got out of the frying-
pan into the fire and, so far, have only succeeded with "Joey 55

and generally returns at dusk to his cage in the kitchen ; and to a
limited extent with Doves. Several red squirrels which I optimistic-
ally released very soon succumbed to the onslaughts of their grey
brethren from the adjoining park.
As any attempt to justify the reference to " records " in the
title of this rather desultory article would refer mainly to the
breeding of such " small fry 55 as Painted, Parrot, and white Zebra
Finches (which I have found just as prolific as the normals), and
must be somewhat of a bathos in comparison to the breeding records
which have appeared in recent numbers, I will mention only one
rather unusual bird which, more by accident than design, I have
bred this season.
This is a hybrid between a cock domestic Fantail Pigeon and a
hen white Barbary (generally referred to as a "Javan") Dove.
Strangely enough there appears to be no previous record of the
breeding of this hybrid and, stranger still, the offspring of two
pure white parents does not carry a white feather. At five months
old it is slate grey, with lighter grey on the throat and the tips of
the tail feathers, and a suspicion of iridescent bronze on the neck.
Presumably this surprising colouring is due to a " throw back "
to some distant ancestor of the father. In size it is about midway
between its parents, and more Dove than Pigeon-like as regards
shape, bill, and feet.
Though this is the only youngster reared by this strangely
assorted pair, they have produced another fertile egg in a later
nest, so I have hopes of securing a " mate " for my solitary specimen
before long.
Until recently I had hopes of handing down to posterity Columba
sweetnamensis (or the " Parson Dove ")--a species of Dove with the
flocking and indoor-roosting habits of the domestic Pigeon. Such
a species would, no doubt, be much appreciated by all who have
attempted to keep Doves at liberty for, though odd pairs may
survive for some time, sooner or later they fall victims to marauding
Owls, while the young are treated by their parents as " non-Aryans "
and forcibly deported to another locality, which as likely as not
will be outside one's own grounds.
Though I always have some survivors flying about during the
spring and summer, I find they never increase their numbers as do
Pigeons and if I did not catch up and confine them while the trees

are bare of leaves I doubt if any would survive the prying eyes and
tearing beaks of their natural enemies.
However, my hopes of thus achieving avicultural fame were
considerably damped when, at a recent meeting, I ventured to
mention the existence of my avian prodigy to certain august
members of the Council.
Apparently Columba sweetnamensis is never destined to appear in
ornithological lists, and my chances of obtaining fertile eggs from
the progeny of Columba and Streptophalia are about on a par with those
of the enterprising individual who aspired to produce a breed of
cattle capable of subsisting without food. Misfortune dogged his
steps, for just as success seemed within his grasp and he had got
the ration down to a straw a day--the animal died !

All members of the Avicultural Society will sympathize with the President,
Mr. Alfred Ezra, in his loss of seven rare Duck and a Burmese Peacock, in excep-
tional and deplorable circumstances. Four young boys gained entrance to

Burmese Peacock and, as the pellets failed to kill it, they stabbed the bird with
an iron bar. In the Juvenile Court the boys admitted their guilt, and the eldest,
aged 13, described as the ringleader, was remanded for three weeks with a view
to being sent to an approved school. The other three were placed on probation.

The Crystal Palace show of cage birds has always been a great event to avicul-
turists and when the disastrous fire destroyed the historic building two years ago
it was at first feared that the most important of bird shows would come to an end.
Thanks, however, to the enterprise of Mr. S. A. Legg, the Secretary, the show was
not discontinued but held in London, and now, for the third time since the fire,
aviculturists and bird fanciers have gathered in their thousands to admire the
cream of the cage-birds of the country.
This year, the show opened in the Horticultural Hall, Westminister, on the
19th January with a remarkably fine entry. There was such a display of
Budgerigars as has never before been got together, including the newest varieties
that have been produced. British birds included some very interesting species
which bore evidence of great skill in management, while the foreign birds included
a number of the greatest rarities.

Miss E. Maud Knobel writes :--
On 30th December I went down to Peaslake in Surrey to spend the New
Year with my sister. I had hardly been in the house more than half an hour when
my sister exclaimed " there is such a lovely red bird out here ". I went to the
window and there on a Canadian Maple was perched a most lovely Bullfinch.
His bright salmon breast looked brilliant in the winter sunshine. While I looked,
he was joined by another, and another, and another, until I counted sixteen.
Two were wonderfully bright-coloured birds, then there were some not so bright,
and the rest were hens. They stayed about half an hour and then they were
gone. My sister has been at Peaslake about a year and a half and only once
before has she seen a Bullfinch in the garden. It was really a very lovely, and
I should think an unusual, sight.

Mrs. Cottrill (a friend of mine), when visiting South Africa in 1928, purchased
(as chicks) seven Stanley Cranes that had been caught on the Veldt. Only three
survived the journey home from Cape Town. All had to be treated for cramp on the
voyage, eventually all succumbed but "Joey". This bird (although christened
"Joey ") proved to be a female, and was given its freedom on reaching Seven
Barrows, which is situated on the Berkshire Downs. She grew into a very handsome
specimen, and became absurdly tame. The second year after reaching home
"Joey" laid an egg (under the table of the office in the stable yard), which
caused great excitement, and inspired Mrs. Cottrill with the desire to obtain a
husband for "Joey ". In due time a second Stanley was presented by Sir Abe
Bailey, which was hoped might be a male bird, but unfortunately it has proved
itself to be another female. In cold, windy weather the two Cranes will walk into
the office or engine room for shelter, standing close to a stove. The second bird,
shortly after arrival, flew into a wire fence and broke a leg, which was duly set,
and it is now as sound as a bell again. Last autumn " Joey " had an accident
and broke her wing, so badly that it was feared she would never fly again ; however,
the vet. very cleverly strapped the wing to the body of the bird and she now flies as
well as ever she did. Each year she lays her egg (under the table) but never attempts
to incubate. Both birds are full-winged and feed with the Pigeons in the yard,
they also follow the race-horses on to the Downs at exercise. They are obliged to be
shut in at night on account of foxes, as they live in the centre of the Craven Hunt.
Both "Joey " and her companion chase the stable lads, and have been known
to peck a piece out of the breeches of one boy, so that one cannot be surprised
that the lads fly before them. They are a very handsome couple, and look most
attractive walking about the grounds. I should be interested to know whether
"Joey " is exceptionally old for a Stanley in captivity ?

Mr. A. H. Scott's "leg-pull" at my expense in your January number,
gave me cause for a very hearty laugh, but in self defence I think that my
literary effort in question was one of several which was published without my
being allowed to see the proofs.
Be that as it may, I contend that the bird " faction " might appositely be
allowed except by a prude.
I suggest that breeders of foreign and British birds are aviculturists or
ornithologists--but that those who are interested in the reproduction of
domesticated stock such as Canaries, Budgerigars, and poultry are " fanciers ".
I have bred, exhibited, and judged dogs for forty years and do not in the least
mind being called a " dog-fancier ", but I do insist that this body of men and
women called fanciers is turbulent and self-interested. You have only to stand near
the benches after the judges have awarded the Cards to acquire a very good
interpretation of both adjectives !

I had hoped to have some anatomical material with reference to this
question, but I have not managed to get same. I must therefore depend on
readers' general knowledge and powers of observation.
In general one may compare the bird's beak, and the method of use by the
individual bird, with certain human tools. A pincer or tongs action is usually
present.
Anyone watching a Crow-like bird will see the beak used as a navvy uses a
pick-axe.
To see a Vulture clipping flesh and gristle along the edge of a rib, one is at
once reminded of a particularly sharp and efficient pair of scissors.
Hawks, Owls, and such predatory birds have not as efficient a pair of scissors
as the Vulture, and tend more to tear skin and muscle, but the scissors action is
certainly present. My Little Owl makes short work of cutting the head off a mouse,
but usually after she has cracked and broken all the bones.
Note that in all these birds the lower mandible is as long as the upper, falling
short of it only by the curved tip to the upper beak, and also that both upper and
lower beaks have a sharp cutting edge.
Various other human activities may be thought of, nut-crackers, sieves, as in
certain Ducks, Flamingoes, etc., stabbing instruments as Herons and Bitterns and
so on. (There is an interesting section in Mr. W. S. Berridge's All About Birds.)
In the Parrot-like birds the only sharp part is the actual front edge of the lower
beak, which acts as a gouge or chisel. This chisel action is very marked in the
Black Cockatoos. Now anyone using a chisel or gouge to pare a piece of wood
will find that a bench or rigid support is very necessary. The bird which shows
this fulcrum or bench action best is the Hyacinthine Macaw. The smooth, or
slightly chased and roughened lower surface of the upper mandible is (except
while climbing) solely to hold twigs, nuts, and food in general, while the lower
beak cuts, crushes, almost, one might say, masticates edible things.
It is very obvious that there is no cutting action at all associated with the
massive and seemingly solid upper beak. My Hyacinthine Macaw has a curious
habit of wedging a small pebble, with a match-stick or a little twig, to use as a
whetstone to keep an edge on the lower beak.
Notice also in the Macaw and most Parrots that the lower beak falls far
short of the upper beak in length.

The function of the upper mandible in the Parrots is purely of a passive nature,
the curve being merely an adaption to hold food and to use as a hook in climbing.
Nothing of the scissor effect of the Raptores is present.
The Kea has a similar hooked upper mandible, which at first sight looks a
fearsome weapon.
Observation shows, firstly, that the Kea uses the hooked upper beak to climb
with, as do most Parrots, and secondly as a support or fulcrum, against which
the front sharp edge of the lower beak acts.
The actual cutting edge present in the Kea is somewhat less than a in. in
width. Surely an inefficient weapon with which to dismember a sheep ? The
lower beak is shaped rather like the back edge of an ordinary pen-nib.
Further, the beaks of the Keas are no harder or stronger than are the beaks
of what we call " soft-billed " birds ; there is just as marked a difference between
the nails of the Kea and the talons of a Hawk.
From my observation of Keas I am satisfied that a Kea could not pick up a
sheep's skin, let alone tear a way into its vital organs. Anatomically it is not
fitted for the job which, if it belongs to any bird, is an Eagle's business.
Apart from small objects which the upper beak will accommodate, Keas
attack boards and anything they wish to destroy on an edge, and just nibble away,
turning anything into sawdust. I cannot believe that a sheep would wait.

MEADOW PIPIT BRED IN CONFINEMENT
Allen Silver told me in October that he had recently awarded a prize
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.963332392857143" page_id="56322640"  page_num="64" year="" vol="">
(I think a First), to an aviary-bred Meadow Pipit. This is an achievement
which must be put on record, for it is the first record of success anywhere,
as far as I know.
The breeder is Miss E. Barbara Hall, of Burton, Christchurch, Hants, and
I hoped that we should have an account of the events from her pen. As she says
" No ", but " will you make it public ? " I do the best I can by copying her
letter to me. I have probably left out a lot, and can only hope that, if I have,
the omission will induce Miss Hall to give us her own account.
" The Meadow Pipit Mr Silver told you about was bred by me and reared
in the natural way by the parents, and is close-ringed. I had four Meadow
Pipits and one Tree Pipit in a mixed aviary 29 by 11 feet, grassed down,
planted with trees, and with a small pond and a thatched shelter. Round one
of the posts I fixed pieces of Virginia cork, for the purpose of collecting grubs,
and the Pipits made a beautiful nest of dry grass in this. Although I constantly
saw the hen with her beak full of grass, I did not discover the nest, which had
four eggs in it, till just before hatching, about the end of June. All four eggs
hatched, but unfortunately three of the young (when just showing feathers)
were taken, I expect, by a wood-mouse, which I caught afterwards. I looked
at the fledgelings every day, as the parents were very tame, and I intended ringing
them.
" There are a lot of other British soft-bills in the same aviary, and all are
fed on ' Mosquito ', gentles, and always pears. The Tree Pipit was so interested
in the rearing operations, that I thought he must be one of the parents, but to
my sorrow he died, and then I saw the two Meadow Pipits carrying grubs, so
the young must have been pure Meadow. They built a second nest in the open
after the first young one had flown, and laid three eggs, but soon deserted."

THE FASCINATION OF KEEPING
WATERFOWL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990609" page_id="56322651"  page_num="65" year="" vol="">
By Ronald and Noel Stevens
The keeping of waterfowl is in vogue. We seem to be falling
under the spell which influenced the Chinese in their love for the
beauty of form and colour that so characterizes these birds.
Not so many years ago the average garden pond was merely
the Moloch mouth for old tin cans, or else it was mother's warning
to the children. To-day, however, it is graced by bullrushes at
one end and a weeping willow at the other. In other words it has
been tidied up and beautified to form an outward and visible sign
of the owner's pride in his ducks that float upon it.
Nine people out of ten start keeping waterfowl because they
are attracted by their unquestionable decorative value. This is
quite all right, because these exquisite little ducks really do add
enormously to the amenities of a garden. It is the custom now
to take guests to see them after luncheon or tea. The basket of
stale bread is taken off the hall table and presently everyone is
standing at the water's edge throwing in his offerings.
That these birds swim and spend so much time upon the water
is, in itself, a great attraction, for they are thus compelled to show
themselves off to the best advantage. In the world of birds every-
thing is so perfectly ordered that criticism seems almost pre-
sumptuous. We have nothing to say against those birds which

through their shyness allow only occasional glimpses of their
glorious colours and beautiful forms. No doubt it is all for the
best, all the same we cannot help feeling grateful to the waterfowl
for being so very frank about their attractions. Their reflections
in the water and statuesque poses at the pond's edge attest to
their being natural showmen. Another point strongly in their
favour is that most of them are very small, many of them are,
for ducks, tiny.
Apart from the decorative value of waterfowl is the vast amount
of interest they provide. This of course is the fundamental motive
of some people for keeping them. Nevertheless the " nine out of
ten " group, who keep these birds because they like to have some-
thing pretty and amusing, nearly always absorb varying amounts
of ornithological knowledge from them, and become very useful
people for beginners to approach.
Whatever the reason for keeping waterfowl all people who
have them are agreed on their irresistible charm. When intelligently
fed, they become most appealingly tame. In fact certain species
seem to have a natural fondness for man which has nothing to do
with cupboard love.
This hobby also gives us a fine opportunity to " play with
water ". Who has not, some time in his life, experienced some
rudimentary excitement in making a pond, either by digging one
out or damming up a stream ? Whether it is done on a large or
a small scale the pleasure is there just the same. It is fun to plan
it all out. When the work commences one becomes absorbed
in it, and by the time it is finished further ideas are already calling
for recognition. Friends are particularly unrestrained in their
suggestions, their well-meaning advice usually having to be turned
adroitly by optimistic references to future development. If you
are prepared to spend money, a landscape gardener may be
called in. His scheme would probably be an ambitious one, and,
if allowed, would materialize into a most enchanting water-garden
which would be a luxury, but by no means a necessity, as a back-
ground for waterfowl.
There are still very many places where these birds could be
introduced. Up and down the country there are beautiful gardens
and meadows where ponds could be so easily constructed even if
they do not already exist.

When a pond is made, or an existing one prepared, the exciting
moment arrives when you realize that all is ready for the reception
of the lovely birds that are to give it the breath of life. And how
they do change it all ! They make the water ripple and shimmer
where before it was flat and lifeless. Their most welcome call notes
transport you in thought beyond your garden to the wild places
from whence such creatures come.
As it is possible to buy sixty or seventy different species of
waterfowl the choice of what to keep can be most pleasantly
bewildering. In no other family of birds has nature spent more
imagination in colour and design. With few exceptions they are
all equally easy to keep in health. All they need is to be fed once
or twice a day on wheat or split maize, and they do not have to
be driven into a house at night. So it is simply a matter of taking
your choice. Some are more expensive to buy than others, of
course, but the loveliest species are not always the most costly.
Anyone who intends going in for waterfowl would probably
like to be told that, broadly speaking, the ducks are divided into
two groups. There are those which feed on the surface of the
water, or just under it, and are known as Surface-feeding ducks,
and there are the others which instinctively dive to the bottom
of the pond to seek their food, these are called, equally appropriately,
Diving ducks.
If it is the intention to make a modest beginning with two
pairs of ducks on a little pond then have a pair of Surface-feeders
and a pair of Divers. Feeding time will show up their differences
in character admirably. It will be seen that even when corn is
thrown into very shallow water at the pond&amp;apos;s edge, which incidentally
is the best place to feed all ducks, the Divers will, quite needlessly,
make every effort to submerge for it. While the Surface-feeders
swallow their food in a quiet and orderly way, the Divers give a
shocking exhibition of table manners. In their efforts to get under
the water they fling their legs into the air and turn their toes up.
It is amusing, but throw some corn into the water where it is deep,
then down they go, gracefully and with scarcely a ripple, to enjoy
the feast on the bottom. Now, you will say, it is the Surface-feeders 5
turn to be laughed at, but if you appreciate humour which thrives
on the misfortunes of others you are going to be disappointed.
They know very well that their friends' submarine evolutions

create upward currents which bring nice plump grains to the
surface. So at the troubling of the waters they swim purposely
over the spot to snatch at the food which comes up to within their
reach.
Of the Surface-feeding ducks the best known and most admired
is the Chinese Mandarin Duck. It is a glorious creature even if a
bit grotesque. Certainly no other country but China could produce
it. The Chinese regard it almost as a national emblem. They used
to carry a pair of these birds in a wicker cage at the head of their
wedding processions as a symbol of conjugal fidelity. The Mandarin
drake is an overdressed, ostentatious little gentleman. His conceit
is appalling, but if he does show off an awful lot he certainly gives
full value for money, for he is beautiful and a dazzling ornament
to a pond.
Not so comic, but equally good to look at, is the Carolina
Wood Duck from North America. As a matter of fact there are
many people who prefer him to the Mandarin. The ducks of both
species are comparatively plain, as are all the females of the
Northern Hemisphere species, but the Carolina has an advantage
over the Mandarin Duck in that she has a musical, reedy call,
while the other bird only sneezes. As for the voices of the males
of the two species, the Carolina can only whisper and the Mandarin
just thumps when he does not sing. Yes, it is a song, but so utterly
insignificant that it is hardly worth mentioning. Even so, to execute
it, he has to throw out his chest in the finest prima donna manner.
"Appearance--good. Voice--indifferent." That is our judgment,
and it is a pity we cannot let him know it.
For those who prefer something not so exotic-looking as the
two species described the European, American, and Chiloe Wigeon
would undoubtedly appeal. The first two should not be kept on
the same pond as they would probably interbreed. The well-known
whistle of the European bird, " Whee-oo," is delightful to listen to.
The American's is different, the Chiloe's more so, and his is perhaps
the most joyful of all duck calls. The Chiloe Wigeon is an absolute
optimist. Male and female are much alike, as are most of the sexes
of the Southern Hemisphere species, and they keep their lovely
colours all the year round. The Chiloe Wigeon is so lively and so
full of the joy of living that it is impossible to resist lingering to
watch him. Male and female are devoted to each other. Note

the duck's approach to her mate. With tip-tilted bill she invites
him to another jubilation. She sets the tempo with little strangled
mutters and then--imagine a " Hip-hip, hip-hip, hip-hooray ! "
the final hip-hooray uttered with all the airiness of sleigh-bells--
and you've got it. When on your way back to the house, his
calling in the distance sounds as if he is snatching at, and transmitting
into sound, the most joyous messages which are passing over his
head, through the ether.
Whenever we see a flock of European Wigeon the thought
comes, " Would not a single American drake among them look
an absolute king ! " and the reverse would be equally true.
Comparing these birds is rather like comparing apples and oranges.
If a very small pond of only a few feet square is all that can
be allowed for ducks a pair of European Teal would be as attractive
as anything to put on it. They are perfect miniatures of ducks,
only weighing 13 oz., and it is impossible to be too eulogistic of
the subtle blending of their colours. Looked at from a distance
a Teal drake does not look anything extraordinary, but examined
in the hand or, at any rate, at close quarters, any gathering criticisms
are immediately sobered into reverent admiration, so lovely is he.
Except for the beetle-green speculum in her wing the little duck
is entirely lacking in bright colours, but her lovely plumage pattern-
ing in subtle tones of grey makes a perfect foil for the drake's beauty.
From a human point of view, however, these little birds are rather
disappointing. They are tamed only with difficulty, so that it is
not easy to live close enough to appreciate them. When kept with
other ducks they are still more shy and consequently are uncertain
breeders. Now the American Green-winged Teal is almost exactly
the same bird in appearance, but it has a much more confiding
character and is a free breeder. So if its higher price is no objection
obviously this is the bird to keep.
Smaller still is the Hottentot Teal. It is absolutely tiny. If
one were put in a cage having bars 2 inches apart it would get
through easily ! Imagine then how small its ducklings are ! It is
still rather expensive to buy because of its scarcity and so, as yet,
is not widely kept. Let us hope that this most delightful little
duck will be more easy to obtain in years to come.
There are very many different kinds of Teal and Teal-like
ducks as well as other Surface-feeders of varying sizes, shapes, and

colours, and character. Space will not allow their enumeration
and description as a few chosen Diving ducks have yet to be dealt
with. But before passing on to the Divers some small appreciation
of the Shoveler family really ought to be made. They are the
Common Shoveler, the Argentine, the Australian, and the African.
The last two are not beautiful, as we humans are apt to assess
beauty. There are even a few people who would rule out all
four species, and so raise a storm of protest from the great majority
of the waterfowl-keeping fraternity.
Let us take the Common Shoveler of the Northern Hemisphere
as the type. Put him on a homely, reed-fringed pond. Now take
a look at him. His bill is rather alarmingly large, but he carries
it gracefully and unashamedly, and now gently lays its spatulate
end on the water's surface and swings it from side to side, sifting
for microscopic forms of vegetable and insect life. Round and
round he goes, rippling the water ever so gently. He is a very
pretty patch of colour in the sunlight, but as he passes into the
netted shade of the willows his rather crudely slapped-on red, white,
green, and blue take on an enchanting subtlety. Before long we
are mesmerized by the gentle rhythm of his movements into a
sense of peacefulness. He becomes the pivot of our attention.
The trees, the sky, the white clouds, and the pond beckon to us
in vain while that little duck swims round and round.
And now for the Divers, the Tufted Duck is most people's idea
of one. It is a good choice. The drake is very spick in his contrasting
black and white, and with his rakish pigtail at the back of his
head he is altogether an exceedingly pleasing little bird. The late
Viscount Grey used to keep quantities of them on his ponds at
Fallodon. We believe they are still there. Lord Grey grumbled
good-humouredly at their prolificacy. There were flotillas of them
everywhere, taking up more than their share of the water. All
the same their owner had an affectionate regard for them as they
were some of the tamest of his ducks. Incidentally, anyone who
has the least interest in waterfowl should read Lord Grey's books
in which he has written charmingly about the ducks at Fallodon.
They are Fallodon Papers and The Charm of Birds.
When you watch a group of Tufted in the spring listen for the
voices of the drakes. Those who are unacquainted with this species
really will have to listen attentively for that very soft, inward

chuckle. You will agree that never have you heard any living thing
laugh so prettily.
Common Pochard, Scaup, Canvas-backed Duck, and White-
eyed Pochard are all most attractive Diving Duck which would
please a beginner. The Red-crested Pochard is uncommonly
handsome, so is the Rosybill, but these two species seldom dive
although classified with the Divers.
Any person who becomes really keen on his ducks will long
to try keeping the Arctic species, such as the Longtail, Scoter, and
Harlequin. These ducks have a tremendous fascination, but they
do not breed readily in captivity and their young are not easy to
rear. There are some waterfowl owners who are obsessed with
the charm of these Northern ducks, and they go to no end of
trouble trying to perfect captivity conditions for these very exclusive
birds. We know of a pond that has been specially made to give
an Arctic effect. Bold stones, a waterfall, a pebbly beach, and a
sandy beach, sea-thrift, heather, and dwarf willows are its dominant
features. Its bareness and severity are exactly what is required
to delude one into thinking that a little bit of Iceland has dropped
from out of the sky.
The Eider Duck, which for centuries has supplied the down for
the eiderdowns of bedtime associations, is quite easily kept. The
drake is a noble bird. His cold, clean-cut beauty is of a kind which
one would expect would be sent down to us from the north. It is
impossible to look at him without thinking of grey northern seas,
of snow and ice, and the wasted glories of the Aurora Borealis.
A charm of waterfowl is that they bear so very markedly the stamp
of their native countries.
Within the last few years a most peculiar Diver has appeared
in a few British collections. It is the North American Ruddy
Duck. It is a funny little thing that lives almost entirely in the
water. Except when found on its water-girt nest it could almost
be said that it is never seen on land. The female lays an enormous
egg for her size and lays plenty of them. The drake is a rich brick-red
when in colour, and he has a bill which is so intensely Cambridge
blue that it looks as though it is electrically lit from inside.
In the spring and summer all day long the male shows off.
It is a most remarkable display. He bobs his head like a bouncing
ping-pong ball that is settling. Then he thrusts his bill into the

water and sends out a cloud of foam, tips his long spiny tail over
his back, and croaks like a frog.
The courtship of waterfowl is always a delight to watch. It is
difficult to tear oneself away from the water's edge when the
spirit of gallantry is abroad the pond. Swans, as would be expected,
are sedate about it and sometimes ostentatious. Geese mostly
show off on land. The deer-like movements of Bar-headed Geese,
and the perfect artistry of their poses, are worthy of a Balinese
dance. A pair will act very prettily, but it needs the competition
of numbers to whip up their best efforts.
Fun is definitely left to the ducks, and it is exemplified best
of all by the Common, or Barrow's Goldeneye. These are Diving
Duck which breed within the Arctic Circle. They have much
similarity in appearance and are amazingly handsome. The
Barrow's is larger and more impressive, and is much easier to
obtain than the Common Goldeneye. They are easy to keep but
are not reliable breeders. Both are famous for their water-throwing
turns in their display performances. The Common does it by
backward thrusts of his feet, but the Barrow's cups a measure on
his tail and flings it into the air. Both are extremely vigorous
water acrobats. It is difficult to choose between them but perhaps
the Barrow's is the prize clown. His large, fluffy gollywog head
helps him of course to this distinction. He provokes tremendous
applause when he lays his head flat on the water and pulls faces.
He really is a lovely thing. It is safe to say that where a pair of
this species is numbered in a collection of waterfowl pointing
fingers will single out the drake for appraisement almost
immediately.
We are afraid we have been greedy with the space available
in this valuable Magazine, so must bring this discourse to an
abrupt end. It is hoped that these outpourings may hint at the
vast store of enjoyment that is to be had through the keeping of
ornamental waterfowl.

By C. L. Sibley
As compared with Europe, America has relatively few fanciers
of wild waterfowl. This is rather surprising, for there are in America
many beautiful estates with waterways well adapted to waterfowl
keeping, and men with sufficient leisure and means to enjoy the
hobby. There have been one or two outstanding collections in
this country in the past, that of the late Mr. J. V. de Laveaga,
of San Mateo, California, being one of the most complete and
noted. Unfortunately, on Mr. de Laveaga's death, the collection
fell into incompetent hands, and eventually most of the splendid
and rare items it contained were lost. Mr. Nion Tucker, of San
Francisco, later had a most estimable collection, with many very
desirable species but, because of a great increase in Mr. Tucker's
business responsibilities, the collection had to be dispersed.
Fortunately, most of the birds fell into good hands and have helped
to increase several of the smaller collections in this country.
Our country is a large one, with many variations of terrain
and climate, but the most ideal places for waterfowl are along
the north-western coast line in Oregon and Washington, and
along the eastern coastline from Virginia southward. Strangely
enough the largest collections are outside of these favourable areas.
Years ago, one of the successful American pioneers in waterfowl
was the late Dr. Whealton, who had ideal conditions at Chincoteague
Island, Virginia. To-day that whole section of country cannot
boast a really good collection. In the north-west, Mr. A. G. Elder
has a good collection, largely Geese and Swans, in Washington,
and in the same state Mr. Adolph Kietz has had some good breeding
successes with various birds in his collection. A very good collection
of Ducks is that of Mr. S. M. Batterson, in Oregon. There are
many smaller collections scattered over the country, and people
here are now beginning to learn that wildfowl on a lake or pond
or stream prevent the monotony which may very well possess an
unadorned body of water after a while.
The writer has gathered together a quite decent collection,
but the Arctic winter climate of New England, where the birds

are kept at two places, has made it necessary to acquire a third
place in Florida where tender sorts may be wintered.
Represented in American collections to-day are nearly all the
species known in Europe, but their numbers are not so extensive.
Of the Swans, eight species may be found : Mute (and its sub-
species, the so-called " Polish 55 Swan), Black, Black-necked,
Whooper, Whistling, Trumpeter, Bewick's, and Coscoroba (if one
may be so bold as definitely to place this large Dendrocygna among
the swans !). Of that number I know of the following having
been bred : Mute (and Polish), Black, Black-necked, Whooper,
Trumpeter, and Coscoroba. The Bewick's has been represented
by very few specimens, and the Whistling has thus far only been
bred as a hybrid with the Whooper and the Mute. Strangely,
the American Trumpeter Swan has been much more extensively
bred in Europe than in its native land, but that seems to have
been true of European waterfowl in America and other American
species in Europe. The Barnacle Goose (Branta leucopsis ), of Europe,
shows itself most amenable to breeding in confinement in America,
yet I am told that it is not too commonly bred among European
collections. Similarly, the American Emperor and Ross's Snow
Goose have bred well in Europe, yet they have only been bred
sporadically here. With us the European form of the White-
fronted Goose is a ready breeder, yet our American White-fronted
is a difficult species. One can't help wondering why birds breed
more readily, apparently, away from their own habitat.
Of the Geese, the Canada of our own country is by far the
most common, and breeds exactly as well as a domestic sort.
The Lesser Canada, Hutchins, and Cackling are all fairly common
in collections, and are all bred in the better handled of these.
The White-cheeked Goose is not common, but is bred by at least
one fancier here, and several pairs have gone to Europe. The
tiny Richardson's Goose is, so far as I know, only represented in
the collection of the writer by a pair, which have not yet bred.
The Lesser Snow and Blue Geese nest easily, the Greater Snow
breeding also, but only in one or two collections. The American
White-fronted is rather difficult as we have already remarked,
but is now being bred by one or two fanciers. The large and
handsome " Greater White-fronted " or Gambel's Goose is not,
so far as we know, represented in American collections. This fine

Goose is not plentiful in a wild state and our laws against trapping
wild waterfowl for propagation purposes are so stringent it is
hardly probable that this Goose will soon be seen in American
collections. Of late years the Ross's Snow and Emperors have
started to breed quite well, and there are more of them now in
American collections than ever before, although they cannot yet
be considered common. The Pacific coast Black Brant is rare in
confinement, while the Atlantic Brant, quite similar to the European
form, is less common than it was a few years ago. No one has
ever yet bred the Brant in America, and one has to depend on wild-
caught birds, so that the stringent government regulations against
trapping have cut down the supplies of Brant available to fanciers.
Of foreign species Greylag, Pinkfoot, Barnacle, Bean, European
White-fronted are all quite well represented in America, and
we believe that all have been bred. The little Lesser White-fronted
is represented, but there are not above five pairs in the country,
surely, although it has been bred. The Egyptian Goose (or
Sheld-duck) is very common, and easily bred, and its close cousin,
the Orinoco, is in most collections and is being bred in several.
Both forms of the African Spurwing are found, but only the
gambensis form has been bred, so far as I know. The Cereopsis
is quite well established with several fanciers successfully rearing it.
This fine Goose would be more generally kept if its disposition
were better. Both the Magellan and its close relative, the Barred
Upland or Chilian Goose, 1 are kept and they have not been so
much interbred as is the case in Europe. One is conscious on
looking at European Upland Geese that the Barred and the Magellan
have been bred together for so long a time that one hardly sees
a bird which appears to be wholly a pure-bred Magellan or a
pure-bred Barred and there are all manner of gradations between
the two. The pure-bred Chilian is a really handsome bird, both
the male and female being quite distinctly different from the
Magellan. Of the other Chloephaga the Ashy-headed and the
Ruddy-headed are most commonly found. Both have been bred.

while hatched, have not yet been successfully reared. The Kelp
Goose has not thus far been successfully kept, and only a very few
specimens have been imported. There is doubtless some method

which might be worked out to keep this interesting Goose in
health, but thus far no one has discovered it. The Blue-winged
Goose is represented in two or three collections, and has been
found to breed readily. This is not a particularly handsome bird
but is rather interesting. Not more than four specimens of the
Hawaiian Goose are in America. This bird is increasing in its
native islands, but a strict ban prevents any from leaving Hawaii.
One can only hope this will be lifted sooner or later for this is an
interesting Goose, in spite of the viciousness of the males. The
little Australian Maned Goose is represented in several places
and breeds fairly well. There are not more than three or four
Semi-palmated Geese in America, but one of these, a female,
has laid, the eggs infertile.
The handsome Bar-headed Goose is imported in large numbers
and is in many zoos and collections, but it has not been bred
readily, not more than one or two fanciers having done so.
During the last two years, quite a few of the Siberian Red-
breasted Geese have been brought in, but in only one instance
has it nested, then producing infertile eggs, the female dying soon
after. This lovely species will sooner or later be bred here, as it
has been in England, for several good pairs are distributed about
in excellent hands.
The wild Chinese Goose was not represented in America at
all until a pair was imported the past autumn. The domestic
form of this Goose is a common farmyard Goose in this country,
being noted for its great egg-laying ability. If this is shared by its
wild relatives, one can hope that the solitary pair of these now
in America may prove the seed which makes this distinctive Goose
an inmate of more American collections.
When one comes to the Ducks, nearly all species known to
captivity are represented. All the Tree Ducks are represented
in America, and the following are known to have nested : Black-
billed, Black-bellied, Grey-breasted, Fulvous, White-faced, Javan,
and lastly Eyton's, which nested for the first time this past year.
Probably there are no true pairs of the Spotted {guttata) in this
country, and there is no record of the Wandering having been
bred.
All the Sheld-ducks are now represented in America, but only
the Common, Ruddy, Paradise, and African have been bred,

although a few years ago a pair of Radjahs laid eggs. When one
says " all the Sheld-ducks 55 he omits, of course, the Japanese bird
about whose status there still must be some doubt.
Of the perching Ducks, both the Indian and the South American
Comb Ducks are represented, although one can find no record
of either having nested. The Muscovy, in its ugly domestic form,
is a common farmyard Duck, and during the last year or two the
true wild and slenderly beautiful Muscovy has been imported.
One can't say if it has bred. The White-winged Duck ( Asacornis )
is represented in several collections, but has not yet been bred.
There are to-day no Cotton Teal or Pigmy Geese in America.
One wishes they were a bit less difficult to transport.
Both the Carolina and the Mandarin are as popular and prolific
in America as elsewhere. It is most fortunate that these gaily
attired species thrive so well under so many and various conditions.
Of the Mallards several species are found. The Black or
Dusky Duck and the common wild Mallard are commonest, of
course. The New Mexican Duck (A. diazi) and the Florida Duck
(A. fuligula) are quite commonly found, the latter breeding rather
well. The Philippine Mallard is not now represented in American
collections, but at one time was. The Yellow-billed Duck, the
Australian Mallard, and Meller's Duck are all found in the better
collections and are all readily bred, both pure and as hybrids.
One great fault of the entire Mallard family is that in mixed
collections the males all have a strongly developed roving eye.
Anas sparsa is not now in America, nor is the Bronze-winged or
the Crested Duck. All three of the Wigeons are quite commonly
kept and all breed readily. The Falcated is represented in several
collections, but is not as commonly bred as it should be, for some
unaccountable reason. The Gadwall is common in every collection,
large or small, and recently I learned of a pair of Fanning Island
Gadwalls in a small collection. These are extremely rare.
The common Pintail, and also its close Chilian relative are quite
often kept and breed easily. The Bahama Duck is popular and
breeds as easily in America as elsewhere. Its relative, the Red-billed
Duck, is now to be found in two or three collections, and was bred,
I think for the first time, this past season.
Of the Shovelers, only the Common and the Cape species
seem to be in American collections. Among the Teal, the Common

Teal of Europe ( crecca ) is quite uncommon, and rather difficult
to breed. Its place is taken in most collections by the American
Green-winged Teal, which in the mind of the writer seems a better
and more finished bird. The Formosan or Baikal Teal is freely
imported, and found in all collections because of its low price
and hardiness and beauty, but only in one or two collections is it
being bred. The Chestnut-breasted can hardly be called common,
being limited to two or three of the larger collections. Its close
relative, the Grey Teal, cannot have more than four or five
representatives in American collections. This Teal is so like the
female Chestnut-breasted that it is often confused with the latter.
The dome-like forehead and smaller size help to identify the Grey
bird. Several collections contain the Chilian Teal and it breeds
freely. Last spring two pairs of the closely related Sharp-winged
Teal ( oxyptera ) were brought over, and if this species is as prolific
as the Chilian, one may expect it to be found in more collections
in a few years. It is larger, and softer in colour than the Chilian,
and altogether a more attractive bird. The Neck-laced Teal, once
represented and breeding in America, is now found in only one
collection. The Brazilian Teal is present in several collections
and has proven adaptable and a good breeder. There seem to be
two forms of this bird, one appreciably larger than the other.
In connection with this species, we have a very amusing situation
at our Florida farm. A Brazilian Teal female has fallen violently
in love with a huge Spur-winged gander of the gambensis race,
and follows him humbly and dutifully about the grounds wherever
he may go. However, let any other female, Goose, Duck, or Swan,
come near her adored Spurwing, and this tiny Brazilian becomes
a fighting Amazon. She routs by her very fury such birds as a
Magellan Goose, a female Black Swan and even the lawful spouse
of the object of her adoration, not to mention many other smaller
and less formidable females which happen, innocently, to stroll
closer to her inamorata than she thinks permissible.
Garganey Teal are brought over to America by the importers
in large numbers, but they must be wild-trapped birds for with
many people the Garganey is reputed difficult to breed. We
find it equally as good a breeder as our native Blue-winged and
Cinnamon Teal but it may be because our stock is hand-reared.
The Versicolour Teal is represented in two or three of the

collections I know, but is not common, although it breeds quite
well. Last spring a pair of Puna Teal was brought over, but
unfortunately, during the terrible hurricane which swept New
England in September, one was lost, so that there is only one
Puna Teal, a female, in American collections. This bird has paired
with a male Versicolour, and it will be interesting to see if the
two sorts breed together. The lovely little Marbled Teal, once
represented in the de Laveaga collection and breeding there, is
no longer found here, nor can I find it listed among European
collections. This lovely little bird should be reintroduced.
Of the diving Ducks, the Red-crested Pochard, the Rosy-
billed Duck, the Canvas-backed Duck, and the American Redhead
are all quite commonly found, and all breed well. The common
Pochard of Europe is scarce, the American Redhead taking its
place in our collections. The Tufted Duck, the White-eyed Duck,
and the Madagascan White-eye are all found, but they are not
commonly bred except the Tufted. Nearly every collection has
the Common or Greater Scaup, and the very good Lesser Scaup,
but they are mostly wild-caught birds and only one or two are
breeding the Scaups, and the closely related Ring-necked Duck,
a lovely and satisfactory little bird. Only two fanciers seem to
have been successful in breeding the Bufflehead, although several
have at different times bred the American Golden-eye. The
Bufflehead needs rather special conditions to do well, and some
collections do not include it as the conditions there are not suitable.
There are, so far as I know, no Steamer Ducks in American
collections. This interesting and curious species should be brought
in more frequently so that fanciers can learn how to maintain it
in health. The Scoters, Longtails, Barrow's Golden-eye, and
Harlequins are all kept at times in American collections, but none
have proven dependable breeders, and the usual method of
replenishing the stock is by hatching and rearing from wild-taken
eggs. Since this is now forbidden by law, these species can be
expected to become rarer in American collections.
Of the Eiders, only the common American Eider is represented,
so far as I can ascertain, and this is not being bred at the moment,
the birds already in collections being merely maintained. An
expedition is planned to visit the breeding grounds of some of
the rarer species of the sea Ducks and to obtain eggs for hatching.

If this project goes through, a more interesting picture of American
waterfowl collections may be presented.
Of the Mergansers, only a small number of the Hooded seem
to be included. I cannot find where the Red-breasted or the
Goosander are now represented in any American wildfowl collec-
tions. The Smew has been brought over, but I doubt if any are
now alive in this country. All in all, there are some very serious
gaps in our American waterfowl collections and one can only
hope that more people will become interested and make a serious
attempt to introduce, maintain, and breed some of the many
species we now lack.

By R. R. Minchin, Director
We have been asked to contribute a few notes on the waterfowl
that are being, or have recently been, exhibited in our Gardens,
and we are confining our remarks to the Australian species only.
It is feared that this article will be of little value owing to the
fact that the amount of breeding which takes place here amongst
the Anatidae is almost nil. The reason for this we are at a loss to
understand unless it is that the birds are not kept in large enough
enclosures and have insufficient areas of water. Most of our Ducks
and Geese are accommodated in fair-sized yards each with a
cement pool about 9 feet in diameter. Numerous low shrubs are
growing in the rear part of the yards in that portion that is farthest
from the public. Even such birds as Paradise and Ruddy Sheld-
ducks, which are provided with boxes and artificial rabbit burrows,
show no inclination to lay, although each have an enclosure to
themselves. On the other hand, a pair of Egyptian Geese that
are kept in a similar yard have reared several young during the
last four seasons, and all our birds appear to be in good condition
and the majority live to a ripe old age.
We are particularly anxious to breed some of our Australian

ducks so if any reader could give any suggestions as to what we
might do, we would be exceedingly grateful.
However, despite the lack of information on the subject of
breeding, we trust that the article will be of some interest in showing
what kinds are kept and their status in captivity, etc. It may be
stated that our native ducks and geese are extremely difficult to
secure, and as an instance we might mention that over a period
of years we have made concentrated efforts to obtain the Pink-
eared Duck ( Malacorhynchus membranaceus) , but so far have been
quite unable to get even a single specimen, although the species
cannot be regarded as rare in the natural state.
Of the twenty species of Anatidae known to inhabit Australia,
fifteen have been possessed by this Society during the last twelve
months.
Black Duck (. Anas superciliosa) .--This is probably the commonest
of our ducks, but owing to its drab colouring it is not much sought
after by aviculturists. It may be seen almost any day on the Torrens
Lake a few hundred yards from the city and at times numbers of
them alight on the Flamingo pond in the Zoo. They are also
permanent residents on the small lake in the Botanic Gardens
where, judging by the extraordinary array of hybrids, they cross
freely with the Mallards (A. platyrhynchos ) and various breeds of
domestic ducks that the authorities choose to support. On two
occasions within recent years, a wild pair have nested on the
thatched roof of a shelter provided for the Flamingos in the Zoo.
Grey Teal (Anas gibberifrons) .--Commonly seen in favourable
localities, usually in large flocks. Like the Black Duck, it is not
greatly sought after as a captivity bird because of its sombre
colouring. It is, however, an elegantly shaped little bird, well
deserving of a place in a collection of waterfowl.
Chestnut Teal (A. castanea). --Seven specimens are on exhibi-
tion and all were captured in Tasmania. The female closely
resembles the Grey Teal but the colouring is darker.
Wandering Tree Duck (. Dendrocygna arcuata) .--Very rare in
captivity and ours are certainly the only ones in South Australia.
Plumed or Eyton's Tree Duck (D. eytoni) .--Even less frequently
seen than the last-mentioned bird and considerably more difficult
to procure. Some two years ago we accepted an offer of five
Wandering Tree Duck and on going to the aerodrome to take

delivery of them we were delighted to see that three of the birds
were Eyton's, these being the first we had seen for many years.
Since then we have been able to obtain two more from the same
trapper who informs us that they are by no means common.
This is one of the most desirable of Australian Ducks and their
long side plumes are a most conspicuous feature of their plumage.
Maned Goose or Wood Duck (Chenonetta jubata ).--Fairly
frequently seen in captivity and we are never without one or two
pairs. During the last breeding season the writer motored to a
point on the River Murray some 150 miles from Adelaide and was
fortunate enough to catch ten birds whilst still in the stage when
they were unable to fly. It would be quite useless to attempt to
catch them in any part of the river where the banks are lined with
reeds or rushes for the birds would take refuge therein and never
be found. Consequently we adopted the technique of locating a
pair with young on a stretch of the stream where the banks were
void of vegetation. Two persons in a boat--one rowing and the
other at the prow--then singled out a young one and after it had
dived a dozen times or more it was an easy matter to make a
capture with a landing net. These young birds thrived on a diet
of bran mash mixed with a liberal quantity of finely-chopped
grass and the amount which they could consume was truly amazing.
Australian Sheld-duck [Cas area tadornoides ).--This bird's
status in captivity is about equal to that of the Maned Goose,
and it is plentiful in a state of nature. Just before Christmas,
1938, the writer completed an 800-mile motoring tour through
the south-eastern portions of South Australia, and many of them
were observed on the lakes and swamps. Their habit of not in-
frequently nesting far from water must account for the loss of a
good many young ones, for we are told that they may often be
found wandering up and down and trying to negotiate the wire-
netting rabbit-proof fences erected by sheep farmers. This, we
understand, is the only Sheld-duck that has not bred in captivity.
Radjah Sheld-duck (Tadorna radjah ).--Until five years
ago when we obtained two males, it is doubtful whether this
species had been exhibited in the collection for over twenty years.
However, since 1934 we have secured three or four more and they
have proved hardy and are a most attractive species that is rarely
met with in confinement in Australia. The most recently acquired

birds were probably not more than three months old on arrival
here and they would certainly have died of starvation had they
not been given earth-worms. After several meals of this diet they
would boldly approach a man with a spade and seize the worms
almost from under his feet.
Australian Shoveler (Spatula rhynchotis ).--Three specimens
are at present in the Gardens and the species may be regarded as
rare in captivity. When in full colour it is a most attractive bird
but is not quite so easy to cater for in captivity owing to the fact
that animal food forms a large part of its diet. The capture of
two of our birds recalls a rather amusing incident. Whilst motoring
with two friends in a lonely part of the countryside we came upon
a small swamp some 300 yards from the road. Seeing some ducks
my friends decided to investigate, and wading into the water,
they managed to catch a young Shoveler which tried to hide in
the reeds although it was perfectly capable of flying. Unbeknown
to them, they disturbed another one which flew past the motor
in which the writer was sitting, and landed in a field some distance
away. After a stealthy approach and by keeping my eye on the
spot I was fortunate enough to capture the bird which was squatting
in the hopes of not being observed. Imagine my friends' surprise
when, after they had proudly exhibited their catch, I exhibited
mine ! One wishes that all bird trapping were as easy as this,
but if it were it would doubtless lose its charm.
Australian White-eyed Duck (JVyroca australis ).--This bird's
status in captivity is about on a par with that of the last mentioned,
but if anything, it is less frequently seen. The writer has observed
numbers of them on a private artificial lake which is several hundred
acres in area and situated not very far from Adelaide. Only the male
possesses the white eye which is conspicuous through field-glasses
even from quite a long distance.
Australian Pigmy Goose (.Nettapus pulchellus ).--The only three
that the writer has ever handled came into our possession last
year. They arrived from Darwin by 'plane and were excessively
thin, and although they were offered all manner of foods they
refused to eat sufficient to keep them alive so that all were dead
within a month. They are wonderful little birds and we hope
to try them again if we are so fortunate as to come by them. It is
doubtful whether there are any in captivity in Australia at the
present time.

Cape Barren or Cereopsis Goose ( Cereopsis novae-hollandiae ).--
Of all the Australian Anatidae , it is with this bird that we have had
most success in breeding. Up till three or four years ago we allowed
several pairs the run of the whole grounds and under those con-
ditions many young were reared. However, because of the damage
they did to the flower beds we were forced to confine them to a
smaller space and since then they have not bred so freely. The
Cape Barren is a moderately common bird in captivity although
it is doubtful whether it is as common in the wild state now as
it was in former times, despite the fact that it and the Black Swan
are the only wholly protected waterfowl in the State.
Magpie or Semipalmated Goose (. Anseranus semipalmata) .--In
former times this Goose ranged as far south as the State of Victoria
but we believe that it must be many years now since they were
recorded from there. Our several specimens all came from the
Northern Territory. They are not usually kept by aviculturists,
but most of the Australian zoos exhibit them. Although the Blue-
winged Shoveler is known in certain localities by the uncompli-
mentary name of " Stinker ", it is felt that none of our waterfowl
more richly deserves that title than the Magpie Goose, for, especially
on a warm day after rain, the writer has smelt them from a distance
of at least ten yards and if the birds are handled nothing less than
soap and water will remove the odour from the hands.
Black Swan ( Chenopis atrata). --Of all our waterfowl this must
surely be one of the most abundant, and providing one had the time
to spare it would be by no means an impossible task to collect a
hundred young birds in one breeding season. We lay special
emphasis on their large numbers because not so long ago a well-
known writer of natural history articles made the statement in
a London illustrated paper that there were probably more Black
Swans in captivity in Europe than there were in the whole of
Australia ! On the artificial lake where we have observed the
White-eyed Duck we have also frequently seen Black Swans literally
in hundreds, and the last time we were there at least a dozen nests
were found without even looking for them.
Musk Duck ( Biziura lohata) .--Our experience with these
birds in captivity is limited to two or three young specimens and
which we have been unable to keep for any length of time. Several
years ago a bird of about a month old came into our possession.

It was thriving well on a diet of meal-worms, earth-worms, and
other insects when it died as a result of being bitten inside the
mouth by a centipede. The last individual we had was another
youngster which died suddenly after having been fed on meal-
worms, earth-worms, and minced raw fish. It was fed several
times per day and ate its food quite readily. The method of giving
the bird its food was to place it in a shallow tub of water and allow
the duck to dive for it. Phillips records in his Monograph of the
Anatidae that a Musk Duck lived for some six years in the Berlin
Zoo. It would be interesting to know the diet on which the bird
was fed, but no reference is made thereto. Almost certainly there
are none in captivity in Australia although it is common in a state
of nature. However, it does not congregate in large flocks but is
usually seen singly, in pairs, or in small flocks of several individuals.
They are interesting birds and Neville Cayley in his What Bird is
Thai ? informs us that : " An old drake will often amuse himself
by throwing out jets of water on each side with a rapid back-kick
of his feet, accompanied by a deep-toned note, or will place his
bill on his tail or throw back his head and, with pouch inflated
and tail spread, spin round and round in the water . 55
The following five species are the only ones which we have not
possessed during the last twelve months and they complete all
members of the family that are recorded from Australia :--
Blue-billed Duck ( Oxyura australis ).--This is the nearest
relative of the Musk Duck and almost certainly none are being
kept in captivity in Australia. We have observed them on several
occasions, the first being some fifteen months ago when we obtained
an excellent view of a pair on a lake near the town of Ballarat in
Victoria.
Gargamey Teal (Anas querquedula). --We have exhibited this
species, but it is extremely doubtful whether they were captured
in Australia, for the bird has only been recorded from this country
on about three occasions.
White-quilled Pygmy Goose ( JVettapus coromandelianus) . -- We
have not heard of the Australian race having been kept in captivity
here.
Freckled Duck (" Stictonetta naevosa). --A rare species inhabiting
the inland districts. We have never seen a living specimen.

The Editor's idea of devoting one number of the magazine to
waterfowl seems to me a particularly happy one because these
birds have been gradually growing in favour with those aviculturists
who have the opportunity of keeping them, for they realize what
a large, diverse, and beautiful group they are. I was always
particularly interested in the Anatidae and one of my very first
contributions to the pages of this Journal dealt with this subject
(June, 1896). At that time there were few who kept waterfowl to
any extent, and the only book on the subject was one by the Hon.
Rose Hubbard which gave a great deal of good practical advice
on the subject. I had myself quite a small outdoor aviary, but
in it I made a pond where I kept, first, a pair of Mandarins, and
later, a pair of Garolinas. These latter are the ideal ducks for
the beginner with little space. They are naturally tame and will
breed in a very small enclosure, and no ducks are more beautiful.
But though, as a rule, they breed more freely than Mandarins,
the young are less easy to rear under Bantams, which is the system
generally adopted by Duck-keepers.
The practice of taking the eggs and hatching them under
silkies or other light hens is very necessary where many ducks
are kept together on a large pond because the ducklings are so
very apt to stray right away from their mother and be killed
by a peck from some other duck. They are the most independent
little creatures and as soon as they become strong are apt to go
scuttling away after flies and gnats right across the pond where
their parent has no chance of protecting them if danger threatens.
They may go blundering in amongst another brood whose mother
gives them short shift. But where just one pair of ducks is kept

D. SETH-SMITH-NOTES ON WATERFOWL IN THE LONDON ZOO 87
in a small enclosure with a pond of small dimensions there is a lot
to be said for allowing the duck to hatch and rear her own brood.
Young Carolinas, reared by their mother, never get wet, whereas
those hatched by a hen, if allowed to enter the water soon after
hatching, will often become saturated and die as a result. Carolinas
and Mandarins are, like Muscovies, true tree-nesting Ducks and
must be supplied with nesting-boxes in an elevated position.
In 1910 we drove newly-cut elm stakes into the ground on one of
the islands in the Zoo Three Island Pond and on these we placed
suitable boxes with ladders leading to them. Those elm stakes
took root and now form a small elm forest on that island.
When I became Curator at the Zoo in 1909 I was very anxious
to work up a really fine collection of waterfowl, but this was difficult
with only the one pond. There was then a piece of waste ground
at the western corner of the South Garden and I managed to
persuade the Council to allow me to develop this as a place for
waterfowl. We dug a pond with two islands and plenty of surround-
ing grass and we formed some eight or ten paddocks for Geese,
each separated from the next by a thick hedge of euonymus, the
object being to prevent the different pairs of these quarrelsome
birds from seeing one another.
In 1910, and up to the time of the War, the Zoo possessed the
finest collection of the Anatidae that it has ever had, and we
reared quite a number, including the first Andean Goose to be
hatched in this country. During 1910 we bred three species of
Sheld-duck, Wigeon, Shovelers, Australian Wild Duck, Snow
Goose, Maned Goose, Tufted Duck, Wild Muscovy, Andaman, and
Chestnut-breasted Teal. Of these last I had brought two pairs
from Tasmania in 1908 which were the first to be seen in Europe
for many years. I had come across them in the collection of
Mrs. Roberts, a very keen aviculturist living in Hobart, and as
they appealed to me very strongly, their owner had allowed me
to take them. They were placed in a very unsuitable aviary in the
Zoo and one pair died before I took charge there in 1909 when
I was able to give them attention and they went to nest at once,
or rather as soon as their southern nesting season came round,
which was in the winter. Some died of rickets because we had to
rear them in a warm shed, but two or three were reared. The
following spring they went to nest again and from then onwards

we reared a large number. In fact for many years all the Chestnut-
breasts in Europe were the descendants of that original pair.
About that time we reared at the Zoo a number of the closely-
allied Andaman Teal, a rare species which seems to have com-
pletely died out in Europe now.
Wigeon do not, as a rule, breed freely in captivity, but we had
a full-winged duck that nested every year amongst the wall-
flowers in one of the flower beds, and the head gardener had to
be restrained from planting out that bed until she had hatched
her brood. When she came off with her family she would march
them round to the gateway of the enclosure and wait there until
someone came and opened it to allow them access to the pond.
A very attractive and striking duck that one rarely sees in
collections nowadays is the Speckled or Black Duck of South
Africa which is dark grey in colour, heavily spotted with white on
the back. It is spiteful with other ducks, due, no doubt, to its
solitary habits in Nature, for it is said to be found only in pairs in
the rivers. It is of the Mallard type, in all of which, with the single
exception of the Mallard itself, the sexes are alike. By " Mallard
type " I mean those ducks that were formerly the sole occupants
of the genus Anas and could at once be recognized as such. Now
a new school of systematists has lumped together the Wigeon,
Pintails, Gad wall, Teal, and Mallard, all under the generic term
Anas, which, to me, seems about as sensible as it would be to
place the Grass Parrakeets in the same genus as the Rosellas !
Fancy placing that little gem, the Ringed Teal, with the Mallard !
To the ornamental duck enthusiast the Teal will always be regarded
as a distinct and particularly fascinating group.
The Baikal Teal was imported in considerable numbers with
Mandarins before the War, but they seem to be rather scarce at
present. When first received they are as wild as hawks though
they soon settle down. The American Teal are particularly
delightful, especially the Cinnamon and the Blue-wing. The
Green-wing is just like our Teal with the exception of a horizontal
white band on its sides.
Geese are great favourites of mine and most of them are good
breeders and make excellent parents, but the pairs must be kept in
separate paddocks. In Nature each pair requires a fairly extensive
territory and will not tolerate trespassers, so this has to be taken

into consideration when keeping them in captivity. The Chloephaga
group are some of the most charming. C. magellanica is the one most
often seen in this country, the ganders with pure white breasts.
The closely allied Black-banded goose, C. inornata or dispar , is striped
over the breast and neck and the two cross freely to the danger of
producing a hybrid race. The females of both are reddish brown
more or less striped, but that of C. inornata is distinctly darker
in general hue than the other. The Ashy-headed (C. poliocephala)
is a particularly beautiful and charming species, but decidedly
rare as also is the smaller Ruddy-headed (C. rubidiceps) . Of the
European Geese none is more satisfactory than the Barnacle,
which we found to be a good breeder.
Except that they are more aquatic, the Sheld-duck are much
like the Geese in many respects, in fact the Egyptian and Orinoco
Geese are intermediate between the Geese and Sheld-ducks. Of
the latter one of the rarest and most beautiful is the Radjah Sheld-
duck of Australasia.
Our success with waterfowl at the Zoo came to an end when
the late Secretary developed his schemes of popularizing the Zoo,
first by the building of the Mappin Terraces which cut right into
our Western Duck Pond, and then by the creation of a hill for
baboons which swallowed up the whole of that corner of the
Gardens.
Now the Zoo has reverted to its former condition so far as
ducks are concerned, with one over-crowded pond and, as for
Geese, there is no room to keep them at all, though a few have
found a home at Whipsnade. But though, from lack of accommoda-
tion, the Zoo can no more go in for serious waterfowl keeping and
breeding, this has developed considerably with private aviculturists.
Thirty years ago the only collections of any importance in the
country were those of the Duke of Bedford, at Woburn, and of
Mr. St. Quintin, at Scampston, in Yorkshire, but now the splendid
collections in the possession of Mr. Ezra, Mr. Spedan Lewis,
Major Pam, the Messrs. Stevens, McLean, Wormald, and Laidley,
in Britain, and M. Delacour and Dr. Derscheid across the Channel,
will ensure the interest in these fascinating birds not only being
maintained but increased.

By Dr. J. M. Derscheid
For about ten years I have devoted most of my time and work
to the various problems concerning the preservation of the fauna
and flora in all the countries of the world, and naturally I have
a special interest in the preservation of birds, as these have always
been my great favourites.
During the time when I was European Secretary of the
International Committee for Bird Preservation, I had exceptional
opportunities to get in touch with a great number of societies and
organizations directly connected with this question all over the
world. I must admit that I have always been amazed to find how
strongly many of these organizations are opposed not only to
the shooting of birds for sport, but even to their capture alive and
to their being kept in captivity.
In several countries, and even in some colonies, stringent
measures have been enacted to that end by the authorities, generally
as a result of the propaganda and pressure of these societies, such
action being most of the time instigated for reasons of a humanitarian
and sentimental character. In many cases, drastic measures
have been taken to prohibit the export of live birds from a country,
even in limited numbers, although no restrictions were made
against shooting the same kinds of birds in large numbers for
pleasure or profit. A typical instance of this is the case of the
Australian Sheld-duck [Cas arc a tadornoides) since several years. Else-
where, such regulations were the only steps taken to protect some
species of birds which were in fact far more seriously threatened
from quite different causes ; for instance, the New Zealand Duck,
which it is forbidden to export dead or alive from its native country,
although it is probably doomed there to complete disappearance
as a species, due to " mongrelization " with the dominant European
Mallard, introduced--alas !--by the Acclimatization Societies with
the approval of the Government.
As a matter of fact the disappearance and eventual complete
extinction of a species of bird in its native country is very often
due to factors quite beyond human control, even when due to
human influence, and still more often out of proportion with the

influence of the most active Nature Preservation Societies. What
can they do, for instance, to remedy the disastrous introduction
in remote countries of unnatural enemies of the local avifauna
(rats, European foxes, mongooses, etc.), or, still worse, dominant
competitors, such as Mynahs, English Sparrows, European Starlings,
and so on. I equally doubt if the " conservation " bodies will
ever become strong enough to oppose the ever increasing land
reclamation schemes, forest destruction, and extensive plantations,
which must sooner or later supersede the original marshes, wood-
lands, savannahs, and prairies, the true haunts and breeding
grounds of most of the bird life.
It is a matter of stupefaction to me that in face of these
unsolvahle problems, so few interested people think of turning
their minds towards another way of preserving the various species
of birds threatened with extermination, viz. maintaining them and
increasing their numbers by methodical breeding in captivity. Half a century
ago this would have sounded like Utopia, but nowadays I am
convinced that it is quite possible, at least for some groups of birds,
on account of the great progress already made in the technique
of aviculture. This applies without doubt to most species of
Gallinaceous birds, Ducks, Geese and Swans, and Parrot-like birds.
This would not be completely unprecedented in the history
of the rescue of wild species by Man. Botanists will tell you how
Buddhist priests managed for centuries to keep alive around their
shrines in China and Japan what is probably the oldest kind of
tree in existence, Cinko biloba , a unique botanical type completely
extinct in its original habitat ; the same applies to a number of
shrubs and plants which have only reached us thanks to the
horticultural skill of nature lovers in the Far East. Among large
mammals, there is no doubt that in South Africa the survival
within the fences of a few farms of fine species like the white-tailed
gnu, the blesbok, the bontebok, the mountain zebra, is exactly
a parallel case, and this is true also of the European bison, completely
destroyed except for some good specimens in captivity, and for
the Pere David's deer (from China), a species of which the very
last herd in existence is still thriving and increasing . . . under
the English sky, at Woburn Abbey !
Exactly the same good work can be done to preserve rare and
interesting kinds of birds, and in fact it is already done, but on

much too small a scale. I have a faint idea, for instance, that as
I write these lines there must be perhaps as many specimens of
Elliot Pheasants (Syrmaticus ellioti) alive in the aviaries and zoos
of Europe, North America, South Africa, and Australia, as at
liberty in their native country in China. It is still more interesting
to note that most of these captive birds have been aviary-bred for
a number of generations, being the progeny of a very few imported
pairs, and still they do not show the slightest symptoms of
degenerating under these new conditions. I even venture to say
that the Elliot Pheasant, as a species, is much more in danger
of complete extermination at liberty in China than in our aviaries.
In view of these indisputable facts, one will admit that one
of the highest goals of aviculture must be to contribute to the
preservation of species by the establishment of permanent breeding
stocks, kept and increased under methodical control and scientific
technique.
The main results of such a far reaching undertaking would
be the following :--
(i) A better and deeper knowledge of the species of birds, their
habits and needs, and probably better enlightenment as how to
preserve them at liberty by a complete understanding of their
natural requirements. Except perhaps for some groups of Passerine
birds, our systematic knowledge of the avifauna of the world is
nearing perfection, and very few new species and varieties of
birds remain to be discovered and described. Their anatomy is
still more an unploughed field, and what has been done in that
direction has been made possible by morphological material
provided mostly by captive birds which have died at the zoos and
in private collections. By far the most promising field of investiga-
tion remains in the study of the live bird, and although a good
deal of this can be done by field-naturalists, there is no doubt
that much more can be learned from the birds kept under control
or in semi-liberty, directly under the eyes of the observer. As
I want to confine myself to-day more specially to waterfowl,
I might emphasize as a good instance that the best and most
complete essay on the classification of that group published in
recent years has been written by our friend Jean Delacour, mostly
as a result of personal observations on all the species of waterfowl
so successfully kept and bred by him in his wonderful collection

at Cleres. Let us think also of the remarkable scientific contributions
made by Dr. Heinroth, Dr. K. Lorenz, and many others, all
based chiefly on captive birds.
(2) A reduction in the demand for wild caught birds on the market.

<bodyText confidence="0.999232428571429" page_id="56322683"  page_num="93" year="" vol="">
There is no doubt that as soon as a species is freely bred in captivity
its commercial value drops quickly, and sooner or later it no longer
pays to face the heavy expenses and risks of importing such birds
from distant foreign countries. I have already referred to the
case of the Elliot Pheasant. This species has been reared so freely
for several years in Continental Europe, and a little more recently
in England and the United States, that its present price is already
below the actual cost of the transport of any bird of that size
from Shanghai to Europe ; the same applies of course to Golden,
Lady Amherst, and Silver Pheasants and I should think that it is
no longer a profitable proposition to import from China either
Brown or Blue Crossoptillons (Eared Pheasants), at least in the
U.S.A. where both species are bred in large numbers, and are
quite cheap in consequence.
No matter how low their price is in Australia, no European
bird dealer would to-day think of importing a consignment of
ordinary Budgerigars, as it would certainly not pay in comparison
with the home-bred birds, and the same is true (at least here in
Belgium) for the Cockatiel, and even (to a lesser extent) for the
Common Rosella and the Red-rumped Parrakeet.
Although the various Love-birds are bred by a number of
fanciers every year in Belgium, I may draw your attention to
the fact that a number are still regularly imported by our dealers.
It is amusing, however, to note that most of these imported Love-
birds come either from Australia or from Japan via Singapore
(being naturally in both cases aviary-bred birds).
In the special case of waterfowl the competition on the market
between home-bred, " hand-reared " birds and those imported
from their natural country of origin, is still more to the advantage
of the first-named as it is a well known fact among the prospective
buyers that the imported (wild-caught) waterfowl are nearly
always very shy breeders, and consequently the hand-reared birds
fetch a much better price. One can therefore realize that as soon
as a prosperous breeding stock of any kind of bird is established
and well maintained in Europe or elsewhere, the incentive--for

local bird catchers--to take a toll of the native avian population
for sale to travellers, ship crews, or export agents, is much lessened.
This may not make much difference in the countries where most
of the birds are netted or snared chiefly for the pot (the case of
most Pheasants in Indo-China and the Himalayas, and, I believe,
waterfowl in India), but it might become a most beneficial factor
where rare species are concerned, especially those restricted to
small sized islands.
(3) The possibility of reintroducing a species to its former native
haunts, when it has been exterminated there. I shall never forget
my first visit to Mr. Blaauw's world famous collection of waterfowl
and other birds at Gooilust--some fifteen years ago--when I had
my first opportunity of admiring his fine breeding stock of Trumpeter
Swans ( Cygnus buccinator ), a wonderful species which I had then
thought practically extinct. Mr. Blaauw told me then that he
was not only slowly but regularly increasing the strength of that
stock, but that he had had much satisfaction in sending some of
the Trumpeter Swans bred at his place to the United States Federal
Government, with the object of restocking some American National
Parks with this species, formerly living there, but then practically
extinct. It is interesting to note in this respect that years have
passed since that time, and that owing to most rigorous measures
of preservation, the small wild stock of Trumpeter Swans are still
holding their own in the remotest districts of the United States
and Canada, but in no way better than the little breeding stock
of captive birds in Europe (now concentrated since Mr. Blaauw's
death in the best possible hands at Woburn Abbey).
One will perhaps object that in the example mentioned above
we have the case of a most valuable kind of bird, already so reduced
in numbers in nature as to be on the very eve of disappearing for
ever, and, on the other hand, kept in captivity under the most
favourable conditions and with no regard to trouble and expendi-
ture. As a reply, let us remember that, a quarter of a century ago,
the American " Wood Duck " (which we call Carolina Duck)
was also considered by the best authorities to be quickly approaching
extinction, at least in most parts of its former distribution area.
With their acute sense of business, the Dutch waterfowl breeders
lost no time in realizing that there was here a new market open
to their productive activities, and they set at work at once, breeding

and rearing Carolinas by thousands and tens of thousands, to be
sent at a most remunerative price to the duck's native country,
for restocking purposes. Nowadays, instead of being a vanishing
species, the restored Carolina Duck is again plentiful enough to
be listed as a game bird with regular open seasons even in very
" conservationist " States.
Such success in the case of the Carolina Duck had a far reaching
effect in showing to the Americans themselves what could be done
to produce in large numbers wild birds born in captivity nearly
as easily as if they were domestic fowls. Of all the countries in the
world the U.S.A. have certainly evolved the most up-to-date
principles and methods of safeguarding their wild fauna and flora,
probably because nowhere else has there been such brutal and
wanton destruction of beasts, birds, and trees as on their territory
during the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries.
At the present day the " Conservation Departments " in many
of the States have special farms where their staffs rear every year
California Quails, Bobwhites, Mallards, Wood Ducks, Black
Ducks, as well as the introduced Pheasants, Hungarian and Chukar
Partridges, etc. These are all reared and released of course to
restock shooting grounds and to provide sport for an ever increasing
number of game licence holders, who would otherwise direct
their attention and guns at the poor remnants of the original
avifauna of the country.
On the other hand it seems a great pity that the American
authorities have not yet understood that exactly the same methods
could be used to tear out of the grip of destruction the last individuals
of wild species of birds in immediate danger, as is the case of the
Trumpeter Swan.
A still more striking example of this is the Sandwich Island
Goose, a monotypic kind of bird actually reduced to a few pairs
haunting the ash-clad summits of the Hawaiian volcanoes. There
these rarieties are strictly protected by law, and nobody is allowed
to disturb them, less still to carry away a few live Geese, even
with the object of propagating them methodically. The annoying
point is that we are not at all sure that the gradual disappearance
of the Hawaiian Goose has been due to human interference of
this kind, neither can we hope to see them increasing greatly in
numbers under the strictest laws within the limited area of a

National Park which is open to all sorts of introduced vermin.
When we think that American money has been freely offered to
subsidize the sending to the South Seas, during a number of years,
of a ship and an expedition with the sole object of raking over all
the islands and collecting bird skins for museum purposes, we
may express the wish to see the Federal Government taking, in
the very near future, adequate measures to ensure by artificial
propagation the future of the Hawaiian Goose as a live species,
rather than as dusty specimens in glass cases.
In a later issue of this magazine, I hope to convince the readers
that careful propagation of nearly all species of waterfowl in
captivity or semi-liberty not only has already been made possible
by the progress of our avicultural knowledge, but will also prove
in future years the simplest and surest way to preserve disappearing
species from complete destruction.

OBSERVATIONS ON THE BREEDING HABITS
OF SMEWS IN CAPTIVITY

(&amp;lt;Curator of the Walcot Waterfowl Sanctuary)
When Messrs. R. and N. Stevens moved their collection of
waterfowl from Worcestershire to Walcot in Shropshire, they
brought with them a pair of wild-caught Smews which had been
in their possession for about two years prior to moving. Late in
the autumn of 1935 these Smews were turned loose on a lake of
about 14 acres.
They were fed on small strips of rabbit flesh and in addition to
this they were given either bread scraps or soaked dog biscuit.
Of course they found a considerable amount of natural food for
themselves such as small fishes, water snails, and freshwater
shrimps.
Throughout the winter the male Smew lived in company with
two male Common Goldeneyes. The female passed her time in
solitude. However, at the end of April the two birds began to
take notice of each other and met several times a day to perform

their respective displays. The male throws back his head over his
mantle, raises his crest forward in Cockatoo fashion and at the
same time utters a peculiar catarrhal sound. He repeats this
performance again and again. The female usually follows behind
him or swims round him with her neck upraised and her bill
pointing downwards. While doing this she swims in a series of
jerks after the manner of an infuriated Swan and frequently utters
a muffled nasal quack.
During May the pair of Smews were never far away from one
another and their conjugal association became a closer one. Early
in June, however, the Smew duck was so active that her drake,
wearying of her endless energy, gave up keeping her company in
favour of resting under a shady tree or preening on a sunny bank.
While he rested thus, the little duck spent her time diving first
up one side of the lake and then down the other. This lake,
incidentally, is about half a mile long. Presumably she was
searching for grit, water insects, fish, and weeds with which to
build up her ovaries. She never came up to the surface for more
than a second at a time and as soon as she had replenished her
lungs with air down she went again. The bubbles which marked
her whereabouts showed she was searching round the roots of
reeds which grow in rather deep water. She set about her task
with amazing speed. All the time she appeared to be in a tremendous
hurry, her business was urgent and there was not a moment to
spare. It was generally her custom to have a short break in the
middle of the morning and a longer one in the afternoon. During
these rest periods she would seek the company of her mate and
after a greeting he accompanied her to the lake shore, where she
preened and dried her feathers. This was most necessary for her
endless under-water activities soon told on the condition of her
plumage so that after several hours of continuous diving she
became very wet indeed, even though she periodically sat up and
shook herself to throw off some of the water from her feathers.
On the morning of 14th June, 1935, the Smew duck was
nowhere to be seen. I was pretty certain that she was either laying
or had commenced to sit. However, in the afternoon she was
diving in her usual hurried manner at the end of the lake farthest
from the island. As she followed the same procedure for the next
few days I decided that she must have a nest somewhere near that

end of the lake and therefore made a thorough examination of all
the tree-roots and rabbit holes in that area. This search revealed
nothing, so one afternoon I concealed myself in a shrubbery and
waited in the hopes that she would let the cat out of the bag and
show me where she had her nest. I waited for several hours and
the only thing she did was to run up the bank opposite to where
I was in hiding and go underneath some thick shrubs, but in a
very few moments she returned to the water. Time was precious
and there were many other nests to be found so, knowing that
there was nothing in those shrubs that she had visited, I decided
to search for her nest without waiting for her to give me any clues.
The following morning I went straight to the boathouse, took out
a canoe, and paddled over to the large island. While beaching the
canoe I noticed one little " fluff 55 of down on the bark of an oak
tree which had rotted at the bole. This down was a pale silver grey
in colour like that of a Carolina Wood Duck. I knew that there
was no Carolina Duck nesting near the oak tree in question, so
I lay on the ground and examined the cavities formed by the
decayed wood. To my surprise I nearly put my nose on to the
Smew duck. She looked snug as she sat surrounded and almost
covered with down. Rather reluctantly I put her off her nest and
took her eggs. Never before had I come up against such a cunning
little bird, and I felt almost sorry when I discovered her secret.
In the nest were six eggs, white in colour, being in size and shape
similar to those of a Carolina Wood Duck. At a guess I should say
that the eggs had been incubated for about a week. Having got
ihem safely ashore I placed them under a broody bantam.
The period of incubation for Smews is thirty days. All six eggs
hatched. In the down the ducklings are very similar to Common
Golden-eye ducklings. The head and neck are black and there is
a white patch under the chin which continues down the throat
and spreads over the under parts. The flank, back, rump, and
wings are also black. On either side of the rump is an oval white
patch, there is a similar patch on each shoulder. The legs and bill
are black, being well formed and closely resembling those of the
adult bird.
We find Smew ducklings exceptionally easy to rear for they are
strong and active from the time they hatch. They are eager to
feed and require no coaxing at any time. They take readily to

small shreds of fresh lean raw beef and they will also eat the biscuit
meal mixture which we feed to all our ducklings. It is worth noting,
however, that we once attempted to rear a Smew duckling (which
hatched from an egg taken in Lapland) entirely on biscuit meal,
but this diet proved unsuitable as a sole means of nourishment.
Young Smews are fully fledged at ten weeks old. From the six
which hatched we reared five and so far as we know they are all
alive to-day.
In 1936 the Smew duck again nested in June and commenced
sitting about the 14th of that month. Her nest was found on the
same island as she used in the previous year, but this time she
chose a rabbit hole and made her nest about 10 feet from the
entrance. There were seven eggs in the clutch but all proved to
be clear. The reason for this may be that the male was an old
bird, for he sickened and died early in July of that year, having
been in captivity about five years. He was in adult plumage when
he was caught.
Fortunately we had another Smew drake, a bird which we
had reared by hand from an egg gathered in Lapland in 1936.
This drake paired with the duck in the spring of 1938, and once
again she nested on the same island at about the same time of
year. Under a tree-stump there was a small rabbit hole, only
about 3 feet deep. She made her nest at the bottom of this and
laid eight eggs. According to our usual practice these were placed
under a bantam. Four ducklings hatched, all of which were
reared, their sexes being one male and three females.
A few weeks after we had taken her eggs the Smew duck con-
tracted a form of abdominal dropsy. Our efforts to save her were
in vain and after a short illness she died. So ends the history of
the only Smew duck which has ever been known to breed in
captivity.
We have every reason to hope that before long we shall have
Smews breeding once again at Walcot. A 1938 duck of our own
rearing has been placed on the lake and she should breed in
June, 1940. Also we have other strings to our bow. In addition
to a well-established wild-caught female Smew (adult) obtained
from a Continental trapper, we have two other wild-caught
females (one a 1938 bird) which a kind friend caught on his lake
and sent to us.

H. WORMALD-BARROW'S GOLDEN-EYE DUCK
BARROW'S GOLDEN-EYE DUCK IN
CAPTIVITY

I do not think that this magnificent Northern species has
ever been recorded in a wild state in the British Isles, though
there seems to be no reason why it should not occur occasionally
like the Harlequin, but unless an adult male was seen, the chances
are that it would be overlooked, since females and immatures
would be very difficult to distinguish from Common Golden-eyes.
In a mixed collection of pinioned wild fowl, the adult Barrow's
Golden-eye drake always seems to attract more attention and
admiration than any other bird. The most noticeable difference
in this and the common Golden-eye is that in Barrow's the white
patch at the base of the bill is crescent shaped, and in the common
Golden-eye, round or nearly so. The head is rather larger and the
irredescence much bluer, and not so bottle-green as in the Common
Golden-eye.
The birds do not become adult until the second year, they
are very shy breeders in confinement.
Adult males begin displaying as soon as they have attained
full plumage in November. At the beginning of the season they
seem to " show 55 to any sort of duck, but once paired they spend
their time courting their own duck and driving off other ducks.
It is amusing to watch a drake driving other ducks away as they
attack from under water, the bird takes deliberate aim, then
dives with hardly a ripple and torpedoes the enemy ; they will
continue to do this for quite a long time, and it seems to get on the
other ducks' nerves, since if the target happens to see the torpedo
coming he flaps along the top of the water in a tremendous hurry !
Personally, I have never seen any damage done to the target,
but a friend of mine last autumn had an immature pair of Barrow's
and had to part with them, because the drake would spend all
his time torpedoing the other ducks and taking out bunches of
feathers, which apart from making the other ducks wild, caused
my friend to fear serious casualities.
When courting the drake swims about with head held erect,
opening and shutting his bill from which hardly any sound seems

to come, then stretches his neck out along the water with the bill
slightly raised and the lower part of the neck submerged, then throws
his head right back so that the back of the head touches his back,
at the same time kicking a jet of water into the air with his foot,
this action makes the bird's body bob like a cork. J. G. Millais,
in British Diving Ducks , depicts the Common Golden-eye making
the " kick ", but shows the foot right out of the water scooping
up a jet of water like a spoon--in this, I think he is wrong, since
I have never been able to see the bird's foot above the surface of
the water during the " kick The Common Golden-eye duck
has a reciprocal courtship and " kicks " too, but I have never seen
a Barrow's duck " kick
In Iceland the nest is placed in clefts in the lava rock, but our
breeding duck always uses a box, sometimes on the ground, and
sometimes a raised box four or five feet up against the trunk of
a tree. She first went to nest when two years old on the 4th May,
1931, and has bred regularly every year since, laying the first egg
between the 2nd and 15th of May, the clutch being seven to eight
eggs. In 1937 she did not lay until the 23rd May, and only four
eggs, and I feared that she was getting old. However, in 1938
she laid on the 28th April, and a full clutch of eight eggs. I have
never been able to persuade her to lay two clutches in a season
as most ducks will.
This seems strange since the two birds mate every day when she
comes off the nest to feed during incubation. The eggs are large
and much bluer than other duck's eggs ; incubation lasts thirty
days.
When first hatched the ducklings are perfectly beautiful, brilliant
black and white like little dominoes. When about a week old, and
beginning to grow, the black becomes rather rusty and they lose
their looks ! They are not very easy to rear and must have some
form of animal food and I do not think they can be reared on
meal only.
In the first plumage the sexes are alike, but the drakes very much
larger than the ducks, the drakes assume a certain amount of adult
plumage during the first winter and spring. One bird which we
reared in 1937 had assumed almost adult plumage by the end of
May, 1938, but this was an exception ; now he is fully adult and
I hope will breed this spring.

Two Cackling Geese were a pair out of six I bought and
imported four or five years ago from U.S.A., I forget exactly
how long ago. Anyway they showed no signs of breeding and
I had rather lost interest in them until last year when I found
the Goose on a nest. A nest made right in the open and the Gander
of course sitting close by. The bird was laying and had laid two
eggs. They were small, indeed exactly the size of a double-yolked
hen's egg. I hunted the country and got two such hen eggs and
substituted them for her own eggs. The following two days she
laid two more eggs and not being able to get another large hen
egg I gave her one more ordinary hen egg and one Barnacle
egg, fortunately having a Barnacle laying at the same date, i.e.
13th June, when she laid her last and fourth egg.
Barnacle take twenty-four to twenty-five days to hatch so I had
to remove the hen eggs on the nineteenth day of incubation in case
she hatched those. I was rather afraid she would then desert, but
she stuck to the one egg of the Barnacle and hatched and reared
it in due course. Her own four eggs were put under two bantams.
One proved to be a clear egg, one had a dead chick in shell, and
the others hatched. We gave one gosling to each bantam.
Having in the past killed, through lack of knowledge, a brood
of Lesser Snow thinking they could live on grass alone, and finding,
too late, that one only was saved, that their diet when very small
needs to be a mixed one of weeds, annual meadow grass seed
heads, clover, etc., we gave the two bantams and their two young
a very large range and only at night before shutting them up gave
them a little biscuit meal, very little indeed, and plenty of grit.
They were slow to start growing, but after ten days they shot ahead
and are now fine birds, a true pair. In size a little larger than
Red-breasted Geese of the same year with whom they share an
enclosure. In the down stage they are slightly darker and lack the
olive golden gloss that young Canada have when newly-hatched,
though otherwise resembling them. I might add that, as far as

I could see, the Goose, when sitting, sat the full incubation period
of the Barnacle eggs without coming off her nest, which was in
this case twenty-five days and which was the same period as it
took the two Cackling to hatch. They are most attractive little

HAND-REARING OF RED-BREASTED

Unfortunately, I lost my own notes on this subject and I have
had to rely for information on a letter which I wrote to Dr. Derscheid
at the time, a copy of which he has very kindly returned to me.
It will be understood, therefore, that details are lacking, and the
account is neither as full nor as particular as would be desirable.
In the summer of 1937 we obtained some Mergansers' eggs
from Iceland through the courtesy of Messrs. R. and N. Stevens.
Inasmuch as we had a lot of other eggs setting at the time we had
to use old cross-bred Rhode Island Reds which, as we thought
at the time and as it subsequently turned out, were much too big
and clumsy for the purpose. Sixteen eggs hatched, two died in
the shell, and two others were trampled on by the hens. Fertility
was good. We had few books to refer to and the greatest help
was undoubtedly Heinroth's Birds of Central Europe.
We did not know whether the ducklings expected to be hand-fed,
that is to say, whether in the wild state the parent fed them from
her bill, but indications seemed to point that way. Moody makes
a similar reference to young Harlequins apparently desiring to
be hand-fed. At first we pushed pieces of freshly caught pike in
front of them, and although they showed every desire to feed they
seemed not properly to understand the meaning of it. It was
almost entirely by chance that we happened to have some minnows
at hand and although we did not think the ducklings would be
able to eat them, we threw some on the ground in front of them.
They were eaten avidly although some of them were well over
2 inches in length and the ducklings were still only two days old.
In the second and third weeks the weather became bad, the
ducklings got wet and, in spite of all we could do, began to die

off one by one, the cause of death in those that were analysed
being pneumonia. At the end of this debacle four survived. They
seemed healthy although they were not keen on going into the water
and would eat their food only when it was thrown to them on
the grass.
In a way it was fortunate that the others did die, as we after-
wards realized that we should never have been able to feed the
whole twelve. Our minnow-traps (wire gauze fly traps baited
with bread) we had to keep working all day and we calculated
that these traps--four of them--had by the end of the season
accounted for some fifteen thousand minnows. The Mergansers
had them all. Naturally, we were anxious in these circumstances
to get them on to an artificial diet as soon as possible, and just
as soon as they started to feather we tried them with meat dipped
in cod-liver oil. It proved useless at this stage and only by the
second week in September, that is to say, when they were fully
grown and ready to be sent away, were we able to get them on to
meat. Meat and strips of raw pike, when we could catch it,
remained their diet for perhaps a month more, until we could
change them to a diet of biscuit meal, such as we use for our other
Sawbills.
I doubt whether any conclusions can be drawn from our
experience with these Mergansers. We should not be prepared
to say that a stock of live minnows is necessary for success, but
it would appear that until well accustomed to an artificial diet,
any food given to them must be moving ; but that so long as it is
moving, they can be persuaded to eat practically anything. In
the early stages, when occasionally our stock of minnows did run
out, we had to resort to pike, and tough as it was, they would eat it,
provided it was dangled (skin and all) in front of their noses on
the end of a knife. On the other hand, they had little use for dead
minnows.
Some time we want to do the same thing with other fish-eating
birds. In fact, at that time we tried with a number of Slavonian
Grebes, Red-throated and Great Northern Divers, but none of
the eggs hatched.

When starting to keep waterfowl on a pond or lake I have
always found the primary question is what kinds will be best
suited to the conditions one is giving them--a most difficult question,
which can only be answered by the birds themselves. For though
everything may look right some species will not nest. We enclosed
in here once six acres of water, marsh, and wood, it looked ideal
and some thirty kinds of waterfowl ranging from swans and geese
to duck were put on it ; only Barnacle and a few Shoveler laid.
Adjoining this enclosure was one other, a smaller one of some
three acres, so the birds were allowed to go from one to the other
and then all kinds went to nest. The answer was easily seen for
in the large enclosure the water was open and more or less of
rectangular shape, whereas in the smaller pen the water was
well broken up into bays and channels, affording far more privacy.
Waterfowl in the nesting time do require privacy. For the same
reason they should not if possible be disturbed in the early morning
or evenings, for at these times they like to wander about hunting
for nesting sites, slugs, and worms. For the latter reason fertility
is better and more eggs will be laid in a wet spring than in a dry one.
Geese require plenty of grass and prefer open ground to nest in.
It is easy to kill young geese by feeding artificially ; if their eggs
are taken and set under hens the young thrive best when allowed
loose during the day with their foster-mother, for they range about
and choose all sorts of weeds as well as grass to feed on, indeed,
I do not think during the first few weeks they can live on grass
alone.
If one can spare the room a collection of waterfowl to my
mind looks most beautiful when they are kept in groups. All
the various Sheld-duck on a water to themselves show better than
when mixed with the smaller duck, likewise the geese look better
apart from duck which they are apt to dwarf.
Given good weather most kinds of duck or geese will bring
up their own young if sufficient natural food in the shape of duck
weed and insects is available ; if not it is a good idea to have at

various places in the shallow water little enclosures made of wire
netting with a mesh sufficiently large to enable the young to swim
in and at the same time to keep the old ones out. They can then
be fed with biscuit meal, etc., and if these enclosures have been
fed just outside during the nesting season the duck will be
accustomed to go to them for food, so will take their broods there
when hatched.
If it is decided to take all the eggs and rear them under hens
it is a good plan to allow three or four eggs to be laid and not
touched before lifting them, these can then be substituted by eggs
as like the ones taken as possible and an egg added each day for
the one taken till the clutch is completed. Otherwise duck are
very apt to desert the nest and stop laying. When setting eggs
it is best to keep the species separate, for not only does the incuba-
tion period vary in different kinds, but some grow faster than
others and may require slightly different feeding and treatment.
I am inclined to think too that if mixed broods are reared and
grow up together it tends towards hybridization.
One sometimes finds that young ducks are difficult to start
feeding ; it is a good plan then to sprinkle a little food on their
backs for they will pick it off each other and so learn to feed.
It is not difficult to rear young duck but, and it is a large but, it
is surprising how many unfortunate things can happen ! A weasel
or stoat in a few minutes will kill the best brood, or a rat dig into
a coop at night, or a heavy shower and some adventurous duckling
sticks it out too long and when thoroughly cold and draggled
cannot reach the coop and warmth of his foster-mother in time,
and so on. A hot sun is dangerous and there should be some
places near each coop where the young can get shade. When rearing
artificially we find most species of duck do best when kept entirely
off water for the first few days, and gradually introduced to it in
increasing sizes and time they are allowed to stay on it ; all
depending on the weather for naturally on a cold day they chill
more readily. Young geese are different, they, when very young,
will not go on to water when reared artificially, so do best of all
when they can wander along a water edge feeding on the small
rush tips and weeds.
Incubation of the eggs is often not attended to with the care
that is needed. Ducks in nature come off the water to their nest,

so the eggs are frequently damped and are, as we all know, often
laid on very wet ground ; obviously, therefore, the eggs should
be moistened daily with warm water and kept clean.
I do not know much about the nesting of geese in a wild state,
but here in captivity it is customary for Greylag, Canada, Bean,
Cackling, Cereopsis, to name a few, to sit without coming off their
nests the full period of incubation. So if the eggs are set under
hens it is obvious they should never be allowed to get cold. The
actual period of incubation varies according to weather, dryness
or dampness of eggs, and closeness of sitting. It must, therefore,
be considered that a species that should, say, take twenty-three days
may take twenty-five and so on.
Waterfowl are a fascinating hobby, possibly because of the
many difficulties to be overcome !

About three months ago we were lucky enough to receive from
Australia a pair of Musk Duck. This was made possible through
the kindness of Mrs. Tyser, of Brora, Sutherland.
Prior to their dispatch we posted to the sender in Australia
a diagram of the type of crate in which we wished the birds to
travel. We also sent him a list of instructions about the feeding
and general care of the birds on board ship. The feeding
instructions were handed to the ship's butcher, who took charge
of the birds during the voyage. A few words about the above two
points may interest aviculturists who are contemplating a shipment
of waterfowl to or from distant lands. Our specification for the
crating was as follows : Size of crate, 2 ft. square. Floor composed
of small-mesh wire-netting, well strained. About 2 inches beneath
the floor a sliding tray made of three-ply wood. Front of crate
composed of laths placed 1J in. apart. In front of these a frame
to hold a metal feeding-trough.
With regard to care and feeding we emphasized most strongly
that the birds were to be kept dry. Many ship's butchers have in

mind " nice weather for ducks 55 (referring, of course, to times
when it rains cats and dogs) so that the first thing they do is to
imitate a downpour by turning a hosepipe on to the wretched birds !
The result of such treatment is a speedy death from pneumonia.
We instructed that no water pans were to be placed in the crate,
nor were the birds to be taken out of it and given a swim in the
butcher's bath. Some butchers haven't forgotten the days when
they required a celluloid swan (generally pink, but nothing to do
with mice, we hope !) in their bath to comfort them after a vigorous
hand had soaped their face and, worse still, their eyes !
While captive in Australia these Musk Duck had been fed
chiefly on raw fish dipped in pollard. Knowing this we requested
that the birds should be given their fish in a dry trough. After
the feed this could be cleaned and then filled with water so that
they could drink. Unfortunately the fish must have been given
to them in a trough full of water, which soon became greasy with
fish oil. Of course the Musk Duck, after feeding, dipped their heavy
bills in the greasy water and then preened their feathers. After
six weeks of such treatment the plumage of the birds became
frayed and sticky, and was not waterproof when we received them.
In view of this we are keeping them off water until they moult.
In every other respect both birds were in wonderfully good con-
dition when they reached us, and the gentleman who cared for them
on board ship is to be congratulated on the way he looked after
them. No other person has, so far as we know, set out from
Australia with a consignment of Musk Duck and delivered all
of them in good health either to the Continent or the British
Isles.
Since the birds arrived here they have been kept in a small
room carpeted with sacks. They always have access to a drinking
trough and once a week they are given a large shallow pan of
water in which they may paddle and so keep their feet from cracking.
The daily diet of our Musk Duck consists of a generous helping
of fresh raw beef, a small trough of biscuit meal containing
io per cent of fresh blood, and a handful of tepe (sun-dried
shrimps and small fishes). They will not eat grain nor will they
touch duckweed.
The natural diet of the Musk Duck is said to consist of fresh-
water shellfish, seeds of water-lilies, and other aquatic plants,

mussells, leeches, aquatic worms, mud crabs, and frog spawn.
Their bills, which are ponderous-looking tools, appear to be con-
structed for the purpose of dealing with soft sloshy foods.
The Musk Duck belongs to the sub-family Oxyurinae, or often
called Spiny-tailed Ducks. Members of this family are essentially
diving ducks, and have large feet, legs which are set far back,
small wings and long stiff narrow tail feathers, closely resembling
those of a Cormorant.
The most unusual characteristic of the Musk Duck is the lobe
on the lower mandible. This is not very well developed in the case
of the two birds we have received, one shows a small amount of
lobe, the other possesses practically no lobe at all.
It is not possible to give a very comprehensive account at
present of the two specimens under observation as they are kept
in such an artificial manner. However, later on when these birds
are well established on one of the lakes here I hope to write an
account of their habits in natural surroundings and ask our Editor
if she will print it.

On the night of 15th February, a disastrous fire broke out at Cleres, destroying
the greater part of the Chateau and most of its contents, including many beautiful
and valuable works of art collected by Monsieur Delacour from all parts of the
world and the whole of his library which contained many rare ornithological
works. The animals and birds in Monsieur Delacour's collection were in no way
affected by the fire, those birds which were in any danger being safely rescued.
Monsieur Delacour is himself on an expedition in French Indo-China, for which
he left Europe last November.
The destruction of the Chateau of Cleres which is famous all over the world
and which has been a source of delight to all aviculturists and naturalists who have
been fortunate enough to visit it, is nothing less than tragic, and a loss that will
be shared with Monsieur Delacour by his friends in every country. Many members
of the Avicultural Society have written desiring that sympathy should be expressed
to Monsieur Delacour in the Magazine and there is no doubt that every single
member will join in offering him the heartfelt sympathy of the Society as a whole
in this great calamity and irreparable loss.

COLOUR IN AVADAVATS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982445291666667" page_id="56322700"  page_num="110" year="" vol="">
I have been long trying to find out why Avadavats lose their red colour
in captivity and, indeed, sometimes become black. Some years ago (I do not
remember how many) I wrote a letter to the Magazine and I believe I said
then I thought the colour was due to heat and moisture ; and also I believe
sunlight, because when one keeps Avadavats indoors, even in India, the red
fades to a nasty yellow.
I thought at one time it is food, but it is not, because for the last three years,
since my transfer here, I have kept some Avadavats, and fed them only on the
ordinary plain seed " Kong " and " Cheena ", that is the tiny Indian millet and
yellow millet, and far from any tendency to go black, some of them have shown a
tendency to become albinos. Some have got white feathers about the head !
In season mine have become a lovely deep red, and I have compared them with
newly caught birds and there has been no perceptible difference. Any that I
have kept in the house and not exposed to air and sunshine, namely those I have
not had out on the lawn in the morning and evening " to sun ", have gone yellow.
I am now convinced, for what my conviction is worth, that Avadavats get and
retain their red plumage in the same way that tomatoes get theirs ! Indeed there
is an extraordinary similarity between the nasty yellow of an unripe tomato
and the nasty yellow of an Avadavat whose red plumage has lost its colour owing
to the birds being kept indoors. I am not joking and am quite serious. Tomatoes
will not ripen unless they have sunshine, heat, and moisture. Nor will Avadavats
in captivity get or retain their red plumage without sunshine, heat, and moisture.
Hence the success of greenhouse aviaries for small tropical birds. I believe they
have been successful !

By C. S. Webb
At the beginning of 1937 I visited the Gold Coast with the
idea of collecting some of the gems of the bird life of the forest
and savannah regions. As in the Cameroons the country is divided
into three natural zones--forest, savannah or park-like country,
and semi-arid. Unfortunately the latter is rather too far from a
railhead for collecting live specimens without entailing tremendous
expense and trouble in transportation, so, much to my regret,
I was unable to include this in the itinerary. On arrival at the
port of Takoradi one is impressed by the entire absence of hotels
--a state of affairs that applies to the whole of the Gold Coast.
In many cases, however, permission can be obtained to stay at
the Government Rest House, which is very pleasantly situated at
Seccondee.
My niece accompanied me on this trip, and we both thoroughly
enjoyed our brief stay at Seccondee thanks to the hospitality of
the local District Commissioner and other Government officials.
As our destination was Ashanti we only remained on the coast
sufficiently long to make certain arrangements, purchase stores,
and select suitable servants for the interior. The trains provide
no catering arrangements, neither do the stations en route, and
so the journey to Kumasi, which takes all day, would be extremely

unpleasant if one did not discover the "joke" beforehand, and
lay in sufficient supplies for the trip.
This journey through forest, resembling somewhat that of the
Cameroon, is very hot and uncomfortable and after a while becomes
rather monotonous. In an endeavour to keep cool I travelled
with the electric fan switched full on and as a result spent two
days in Kumasi Hospital suffering from muscular rheumatism.
This was not as boring as it might have been for I was able to
get an occasional glimpse of the local bird life, and was highly
amused one day at a little comedy acted by a party of Pied Crows
(\0x25A0Corvus albus). They had gathered together in the shade of a small
tree, when there was a sudden commotion and I noticed that
they had " treed " a large lizard. Two of the Crows were chasing
it among the branches and the rest had spaced themselves evenly
on the ground below watching the proceedings intently, knowing
full well that sooner or later the lizard would have to jump for
its life. They frequently changed position according to the move-
ments of the prey overhead and after several minutes of this comic
procedure the lizard was " cornered " and was compelled to
jump. There was an immediate scrimmage of Crows on the ground
and one emerged with the lizard in its beak and flew off, with the
others in hot pursuit.
From Kumasi we went about 35 miles north by road to the
outskirts of Mampong--a native town in the forest. Actually
most of the virgin forest in Ashanti has disappeared owing to the
extensive growing of cocoa by the natives. It happened that just
prior to our visit the price of cocoa rose so suddenly that the natives
were getting far more money than their limited requirements
necessitated, which made them very independent and unhelpful.
As in all, cocoa-growing countries the climate is very hot and
humid, and any physical exertion in the Gold Coast forest, such
as scrambling through undergrowth or climbing trees, is sufficient
to bring forth streams of perspiration and quickly makes one feel
quite exhausted. Changing into something dry was my chief
form of recreation, but it only meant a few minutes' comfort.
Our first captures were some Grey-headed Negro-finches
(Nigrita canicapilla) ; an Allied Hornbill (. Lophoceros semifasciatus ) ;
a Black-and-white Casqued Hornbill ( Bycanistes subcylindricus )--
a large quaint-looking species which has only quite recently been

located as far west as the Gold Coast ; and some Red-headed
Parrots (Poicephalus gulielmi fontiensis )--a subspecies which is rare
in captivity. But trapping was exceedingly difficult and bird life
comparatively scarce.
My chief interest here, as in Cameroon, was new species of
Sunbirds, but at that season (February) they were feeding almost
exclusively on the flowers of Bombax trees. These trees grow to a
great height and there are usually no branches within 50 feet of
the ground, also the trunk and branches are covered with hard
thorny spikes, so that it needs a great deal of enthusiasm, in such
an enervating climate, to make an attempt to reach the top. In
a previous article I described the capture of a Buff-throated Sun-
bird ( Chalcomitra adelberti ) in a Bombax tree, and in a similar way
I managed to get a specimen of the exquisitely coloured Superb
Sunbird (Cinnyris superbus).
In the same district we were also successful in getting
a pair of the quaint-looking White-crested Hornbills ( Tropicranus
albocristatus) --birds unlike any other Hornbills with their white
crests looking like bonnets, and their very long graduated tail-
feathers. They appear to be more insectivorous than any other
species inhabiting the forest.
Owls were not uncommon and a pair of Fraser's Eagle-Owls
(Bubo poensis) was obtained. These fascinating birds with their
lovely large brown eyes and their soft barred plumage are very
handsome and become very tame, making charming, intelligent
pets. Equally beautiful, though small by comparison, was a pair
of W. African Wood Owls (Strix woodfordii nuchalis), with large
black eyes and reddish-brown plumage, spotted with white. An
Owl could often be located in the day-time when it was roosting,
if it had been seen by an inquisitive Bulbul (Pycnonotus) , for the
latter would set up a chattering alarm note which would quickly
bring more Bulbuls on the scene. As the chattering increased
other birds, especially Sunbirds, would arrive to see the cause of
the commotion. Eventually the Owl would resent all this unwanted
attention and fly off seeking a quieter spot, but usually followed
by Bulbuls, so if the Owl only flew a short distance the " mobbing "
would start afresh.
In Ashanti the Twi natives have a legend concerning this
unfriendly relationship between Bulbuls and Owls, and the native
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.993525675" page_id="56322714"  page_num="114" year="" vol="">
I 14 C. S. WEBB-A COLLECTOR IN THE GOLD COAST COLONY
name for both is the same except that a suffix is added for that
of the Bulbul. The legend runs : "In early times there was a
Bulbul who, being a hard-working fellow and careful with his
money, accumulated more wealth than he could conveniently
manage, so he looked round to find someone capable of looking
after his hard-earned savings. His choice fell on an Owl, who
was not only wise but was also big and strong. The Owl agreed
to take care of the money, but some time later when the Bulbul
required some of it, the Owl made the excuse that he had none
with him because he had hidden it away. Again and again the
Bulbul tried to get his money, but each time the Owl made fresh
excuses and finally admitted that he had squandered it all. This
so incensed the Bulbul that he told all his friends, who gathered
together and mobbed the Owl furiously. So, from that day Owls
have always been afraid to come out in daylight, or if any dare do
so they are immediately chased by Bulbuls, who have never
forgotten or forgiven a gross injustice to one of their forefathers."
Hawks were quite plentiful at Mampong and perhaps the most
conspicuous was the African Harrier (Gymnogenys typicus). These
long-legged Hawks, with bare yellow skin on the face, were often
seen clinging to clumps of parasitic plants on the high trees,
apparently searching for food--perhaps young birds or small
arboreal mammals. They are also fond of palm-nuts, i.e. the outer
oily husk, which seems an extraordinary diet for a Hawk. Another
peculiarity is their flexibly jointed legs which bend partly backwards
as well as forwards. I obtained a fine specimen which was fed
for a while on palm-nuts and flesh and then on the latter only.
It appeared to be perfectly healthy on a carnivorous diet, but
there is no doubt about their fondness for palm-nuts when at
large, for these Harriers are only found in districts where palm-nuts
flourish. This, of course, only applies to the forest race (G. t.
pectoralis ).
A rather rare Hawk which I obtained was the African Little
Sparrow-Hawk (Accipiter minullus zenkeri ). This, as its name implies,
is very diminutive, but is nevertheless very handsome with black
head, slaty black upper parts, whitish breast, and chestnut flanks.
Like all Sparrow-Hawks these birds are exceedingly quick, have
incredibly sharp claws, and are adept at catching birds. Sparrow-
Hawks and Goshawks frequently got caught in my nets when
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.98256445" page_id="56322715"  page_num="115" year="" vol="">
C. S. WEBB--A COLLECTOR IN THE GOLD COAST COLONY I 15
darting through some gap in the trees, but quite as often they
were caught through swooping at a bird that had already become
entangled in a net. They are so keen-sighted that they are nearly
sure to detect the struggling of a captive bird unless it is released
almost at once. Few aviculturists nowadays are interested in the
smaller hawks, but apart from this I dislike catching them as they
invariably badly damage the nets with their powerful legs and
claws, which necessitates hours of tedious labour repairing them.
It is also a tricky business trying to disentangle a Sparrow-Hawk
from a net, and to avoid a painful experience it is essential to
catch the culprit by the legs (avoiding the claws) and to retain
hold of them all the while.
Squirrels are very common in the Gold Coast, especially the
White-spotted (Funisciurus leucostigma ) and Gambian Tree Squirrel
(.Heliosciurus gambianus) . The latter must take a heavy toll of young
bird life and eggs, judging by the behaviour of a pair that I had
in captivity. These were hand-reared by my niece and caused us
constant amusement by their playful antics. Although given
complete freedom they never ventured far away and always turned
up when we were having our meals and when it was time to sleep.
Their one drawback was that they could not be trusted with birds,
and I had two birds killed before realizing that they were very
carnivorous by nature. In fact Gambian Tree Squirrels are very
much like mongooses in habits and appearance, the tail being
rather thin and straight and never arched in the typical squirrel
fashion. In diet they are practically omnivorous and are especially
fond of eating the brains out of a dead bird. After I reached England
one climbed up to a Sparrow's nest and, although it was attacked
viciously by the cock Sparrow, it took out the eggs one by one
and ate them.
When one thinks of the abundance of these squirrels in the
Gold Coast forest it makes one wonder how the smaller birds
survive. Only those species with protective nesting habits such
as Tinker-birds and Barbets, etc., which nest in small holes in trees,
or species large enough to protect their eggs and young can be
immune from the depredations of these creatures.
I noticed that the western form of Grey-headed Negro-Finch
(Nigrita canicapilla emilite) had quite different call-notes from those
of the race found in the Cameroon (jV. c. canicapilla). It must be

very unusual for two races of the same species only separated by
a short distance to have completely different call-notes.
Finches and Waxbills were not much in evidence in the Gold
Coast forest and one missed the Black-capped Waxbills (. Estrilda
nonnula and E. atricapilla) of the Cameroon forest. The most
interesting seed-eaters at Mampong were the western race of
the Blue-billed Weaver-Finch ( Spermophaga hamatina hamatina) and
the Green Twin-spot Waxbill ( Mandingoa nitidula schlegeli). The
former was by no means common and the latter very rare. Another
rare but beautiful seed-eater was the Crimson Seedcracker ( Pirenestes
ostrinus). This glossy crimson and black bird I found to be one of
the most elusive of the West Coast birds. In Cameroon after weeks
of hunting in the most suitable localities--overgrown boggy places
in the more open parts of the forest--I only captured one pair,
and in the Gold Coast I was even less fortunate, for I only got
one specimen. It is strange that it is so rare compared with the
other thick-billed Finch--the Blue-billed Weaver-Finch--which is
somewhat similar in habits and appearance. About 50 miles
north of Kumasi the forest gives way to savannah country which
becomes drier and drier as one proceeds northwards, and then
the semi-arid belt with its stunted thorn-bush growth is reached.
It might be imagined that any tropical forest would be a paradise
for birds, but it is the drier regions where they are far more plentiful.
To be sure of seeing an abundance of bird life, both in variety
and numbers, it is only necessary to visit some stream or river,
with its usual fringing luxurious vegetation, running through
some dry region.
In seeking such a spot I went northwards from Mampong
through the savannah country, and found that, being the end of
the dry season, the usual annual fires had swept the country
leaving it quite barren. The charred leafless trees, and the ground
covered with the ashes of burnt grass and shrubs, presented a
picture of complete desolation. There were hundreds of square
miles of this eyesore and one wondered what could have happened
to all the bird life. On reaching the River Pru, about 120 miles
north of Kumasi, a veritable oasis came into view. The trees
and bushes bordering the water being of a totally different kind--
mainly evergreens--and not being interspersed with dried grasses,
had entirely escaped the fire. This offered a natural sanctuary

to all the birds of the surrounding countryside and I have never
gazed on such an animated scene. Thousands of Weaver-birds
were twittering in the trees and large flocks of them were bathing
in shallow water. Mixed up with these were Whydahs, Orange-
cheeked Waxbills, Bar-breasted Firefinches, and Gordon-bleus in
great numbers, and other birds such as Spectacled and Fairy
Flycatchers, Coppery and Beautiful Sunbirds, many species of
Kingfishers, etc., were plentiful. The natural beauty of the river
combined with such a dazzling display of bird life in the bright
tropical sunlight presented a picture almost impossible to describe.
This appeared to be the ideal place for collecting although
I was well aware that living in proximity to the river would have
serious drawbacks, such as exposing oneself to the attacks of the
dreaded tsetse flies and mosquitos. The natives themselves prefer
to make their villages as much as two miles or more from a river
and carry all their water this distance rather than tolerate the
blood-sucking tsetse flies--carriers of sleeping sickness.
The only available place that we could occupy was the Govern-
ment Rest House at Prang--some two miles from the river--so,
having obtained the necessary permission, we made the long
tiring journey from Mampong by night with all our birds a fortnight
later.
Our first project was to get some quarters built near the river,
for we had decided to risk the dangers of dwelling where insect
pests were most numerous. To offset this we were able to enjoy
the beautiful river scenery and to be right among the bird life
and so save constant journeyings to and fro, which in the heat of
the Gold Coast was in itself a big consideration.
Fortunately the native chief of the district was very friendly
and helpful, and having learnt our requirements he immediately
ordered about a hundred natives to commence building sufficient
grass huts to house us, our servants, and the birds. With two natives
beating tom-toms furiously to spur the others on, the huts sprang
up like mushrooms. Every native had an appointed task and while
huts were being erected some natives were cutting grass, others
poles, and a few making string from the inner bark of trees for
binding the thatch, and some of the old men, well experienced
at the job, were making grass mats for walls. Thus in two days
everything was completed.

Soon after my first journey through the savannah country the
first heavy rain of the season fell and the charred stumps of trees
soon burst into a wonderful green, and from the ash-covered soil
a profusion of plants sprang up in an incredibly short space of
time. It was as if the whole countryside had been suddenly thrust
from winter into spring. Although all this was very pleasing to
the eye it only meant extra work for me, as many of the birds
left the riverside foliage and returned to their savannah haunts.
If I had come to the district a few weeks earlier it would have
saved me miles of trudging, especially when trapping Sunbirds.
There were some lovely species here not found in the forest zone,
such as the Coppery ( Cinnyris cupreus), the Splendid (C. coccinigaster ),
the Beautiful ( Nectarinia pulchella) , and the Senegal Scarlet-breasted
Sunbird ( Cholcomitra senegalensis )--all exquisite birds with metallic
plumage. Specimens of all these were obtained, but the Splendid
Sunbirds, which rival in beauty the Superb Sunbird of the forest,
were by far the hardest to trap. They were rather uncommon
and showed a preference for feeding on the flowers of the highest
savannah trees rather than on the flowering shrubs of the riverside.
I have always regarded Sunbirds as the quickest of all birds in
detecting anything in the nature of traps, nets, or bird-lime, and
these Splendid Sunbirds were certainly no exception. They were
so elusive that after many weeks of tree-climbing I only managed
to get three specimens.
The Coppery Sunbirds, which look like miniature Tacazzi
Sunbirds, were very plentiful and to see a lot together on a flowering
tree was a wonderful sight.
Beautiful Sunbirds were common for a while, but after the
first few heavy rains they all disappeared--returning northwards
to their real home--the semi-arid belt. This species is found
right across Africa in the zone immediately below the desert.
As with the Malachite Sunbird the male has elongated central
tail feathers and has an eclipse-plumage. The Green-headed
Sunbird ( Cinnyris verticalis), which is also found in the forest, prefers
to remain in thick vegetation and in the savannah country is
only found along the edges of rivers and streams where there is
plenty of cover.
A Sunbird with entirely different habits to any of the foregoing
is the Violet-backed Sunbird ( Anthreptes longuemarei). I rarely

ever saw this species feeding on flowers, and the specimens that
I captured were in company with Glossy Starlings, Amethyst
Starlings, Golden Orioles, and other fruit-eating birds, usually
in a wild fig tree. They live mainly on fruit and insects and
occasionally nectar, consequently the usual liquid food given to
Sunbirds in captivity does not suffice. It is better to treat them
as one would Sugarbirds or Fruitsuckers.
To facilitate the trapping of the birds in the riverside foliage,
I hired a native canoe which enabled me to set nets in the over-
hanging creepers and branches. Many of these creepers formed
natural archways through which Malachite, Pigmy, and Shining
Blue Kingfishers could be seen darting to and fro, making a most
delightful scene.
The peacefulness and beauty of this river with its lovely
reflections and varied bjrd life never ceased to make me glad
that I was miles from civilization.
The Pigmy Kingfisher ( Ispidina picta ), although found some-
times along streams, is really an insectivorous bird and is met
with in any type of vegetation, often miles from water, whereas
the Malachite Kingfisher ( Alcedo cristata) and the Shining Blue
Kingfisher ( Alcedo quadribrachys) are both fish-eaters. Adult insect-
eating Kingfishers such as the Pigmy and the Forest Kingfisher
(.Halcyon senegalensis fuscopilea) may with patience be taught to eat
artificial food, but the fish-eaters, unless taken as nestlings, are
almost impossible to establish. Being particularly keen on getting
some of the latter, especially that gem of a bird the Shining Blue
Kingfisher, I searched the banks of the river in my canoe for likely
nesting holes, and was lucky to find one frequented by a pair of
these birds. Unfortunately the breeding season only commenced
just prior to our departure so I was compelled to make a chance
excavation in the hope of finding young. With the aid of a cutlass
the end of the tunnel was soon reached, so I proceeded to scoop
out the earth from the nesting chamber with my hands. At this
stage I got a nasty shock for I found that it was occupied by a
large snake which turned out to be a Black and Yellow Cobra--
a very venomous species.
It is quite probable that this unwelcome intruder had devoured
the rightful occupants, but as a slight compensation for this I
captured the snake alive and added it to the general collection.

In the excitement of this little episode I failed to notice that my
canoe was drifting down-stream, so I had the pleasant task of
swimming after it fully dressed. The heat was so terrific that I
frequently swam the river with all my clothes on in preference to
using the canoe, merely so that my wet clothes would create a
cool layer of air round my body and thus provide temporary relief
from the roasting sunshine.
The riverside vegetation sometimes referred to as gallery forest
contained some interesting Robin-Chats ( Cossypha albicapilla and
C. niveicapillo) and a very curious bird known as the Oriole Babbler
[Hypergerus atriceps). The English name of the latter is not a very
fitting one for, except that the Oriole Babbler has yellow and green
in its plumage, it has little resemblance to any Oriole and is even
less like a typical Babbler. It is not gregarious and therefore does
not indulge in community babbling, but it has a variety of calls,
the usual one being a whistle up and down the scale uttered in a
quick lively manner. Others reminded me very much of the notes
of certain Bush-Shrikes. The markings are rather unusual, for
the head is black, with each feather laced with silver, while the
upper parts are olive green and the under parts yellow, with a
black breast-band.
One day while trying to capture one of these rare birds I
caught five Weaver-birds [Ploceus cucullatus) that had flown into
one of my nets set in a creeper overhanging the water. Not requiring
anything so common I released them one by one while standing
in the canoe, but the last one, in its eagerness to escape, dashed
down a bit too low, struck the water, and started flapping its
wings rapidly in an endeavour to reach the shore. A second later
there was a big splash but no sign of the Weaver-bird--a large
fish had taken it. I thought then that this would indeed be a
paradise for some of our English anglers who often sit for hours
waiting patiently for something to happen.
Every afternoon in February a large flock of Carmine Bee-eaters
[Merops nubicus) arrived in the vicinity of the river and remained
there for several hours performing aerial acrobatics while catching
flying insects, but often they swooped down at the water, just
touching it with their bills presumably to catch flies, as I have
never known Bee-eaters to drink. They certainly do not in captivity.
I have rarely seen any birds more attractive either in colour or

flight than Carmine Bee-eaters. They are clothed in a garment
of pale blue and red on the back, with a rosy red breast and blue
and black head. They are also among the largest of the family
and have the central tail feathers about 7 inches long. Like
all Bee-eaters, their short legs and long pointed wings make them
well adapted for flight. In the dry season when grass fires are
sweeping the country these birds are attracted long distances by
the sight of the rising smoke, for they know that where there's
a fire there's a feast. As the flames advance they hover close by,
swooping on the flying insects--mainly grasshoppers--as these are
driven from cover and safety by the heat. Having captured a
tit-bit they usually make for somewhere to perch so that they
can bang it hard with a sideways swing of the bill to ensure killing
it. This habit is continued in captivity even with artificial food,
and they rarely eat a piece of meat without " killing " it first on
the perch.
Bee-eaters and Kingfishers and, I suppose, all other birds that
tunnel into banks, run equally well backwards or forwards--
a trait brought about no doubt by necessity. One of the greatest
problems in the Northern Territory was getting a fresh daily
supply of flesh for my Hawks, Owls, and Kingfishers. In Prang
the natives only killed a beast once or twice a week for local
consumption, and in that climate meat would not remain fresh
for 24 hours, so in between times I had to purchase the skinny
native fowls at is. 6 d. or 2s. each. It took several of these bony
creatures to satisfy our carnivorous birds for one day, and as often
as not, even fowls were not procurable. On many occasions my
house-boy spent hours cycling round to native villages trying to
purchase domestic pigeons for bird food. When his efforts were
unsuccessful I had to get busy quickly trying to catch common
birds such as Weavers and Doves with my nets. Even the feeding
of our insectivorous birds was a bit of a worry for, although we
had plenty of dried flies, ants' eggs, and biscuit meal, it was very
difficult getting a constant supply of eggs, the latter when hard-
boiled being, of course, a very necessary ingredient. As there were
no Europeans living in the district there was no demand for new-
laid eggs, and those that were brought to the local market were
usually from outlying villages where they might have been
accumulating for any period up to a month before being deemed

sufficient to merit the long journey to market to sell them. On an
average nine eggs out of every dozen were rotten and this even
applied to the eggs presented to us by the local chief. For our
fruit-eating birds, bananas had to be brought from the forest zone
about ioo miles away.
In spite of these and many other difficulties we got together a
fine collection, including Tinker-birds, Barbets, Robin-Chats,
Golden Orioles, Sunbirds, Starlings, Flycatchers, Oriole-Babblers,
Kingfishers, Eagle-Owls, Owlets, Hawks, Touracos, etc., and
a number of small mammals. In the Northern Territory I had
to do all my own trapping and as the collection grew and grew
our duties became more and more strenuous. Weakened by a
recurrence of a very bad dose of malaria that I had at Mampong
in the forest zone, I felt that I had reached the limit of endurance
when the time came for us to leave on the 120 mile journey to
Kumasi. My niece, who had withstood the effects of roughing it
in a hot humid enervating climate with bad food and too much
hard work, had the misfortune to develop an attack of malaria
on the day that we were leaving for the railhead. She had to
travel all night on a lorry with a temperature of 104* over terribly
bumpy roads. During this nightmare we encountered a very bad
storm which blew a large tree down across the road, and it took
twenty natives with cutlasses, working in the light of our head-
lamps, nearly an hour to clear away the trunk and masses of
branches.
After one day's respite at Kumasi we caught the train to the
coast and my niece had to be carried to the train from the hospital.
We soon forgot all the hardships and rejoiced to think that we
were able to introduce quite a number of new species to England.
We look back on the Gold Coast as being a wonderful country
for birds, but definitely not one in which to take liberties with
one's health.

A few brief further notes on this species new to aviculture
may be of interest.
As previously recorded, the four birds imported last year did
well for a time but, as the summer went on, showed signs of failing
health. One died and proved to be badly infested with tapeworms
of a tropical genus, which must have been present in the Parrots
on arrival.
The three survivors were caged and given medicine, and after
a time they began to improve considerably in appetite and plumage,
and were then returned to the aviary. While indoors they began,
for the first time, to eat seed--mainly hemp, sunflower, and spray
millet--in addition to their former diet of fruit and a little bread
and milk.
During the early part of the winter the worst specimen of the
three was again noticed to be infested with worms, and had to be
taken in for a second course of treatment which, we hope, has been
successful. It is now once more with its companions in the aviary.
Given a decent start, which mine have not had owing to the
wretched parasites already mentioned, there seems little doubt
that Dwarf Parrots would prove by no means difficult to keep.
They are clearly not delicate as regards temperature for,
except during periods of very severe and snowy weather, my birds
spend most of their time in the open flight. Even the rough-
plumaged specimen that had to be brought in a second time, has
taken no harm through being returned to the aviary in mid-win ter,
after being kept for some weeks in a birdroom at a temperature
of about 75 0 .
As I have already recorded, this Cyclopsittacus , though a small
Parrot in appearance, is in its voice and all its movements and
manners, a Lorikeet. The flight, in an aviary, is like that of
Lorikeets, rather heavy and clumsy, but it is possible that at
liberty a considerable degree of speed may be attained.
The three birds are good friends, and the pair (?) seemed
pleased to see their third companion on its return, and made no
attempt to attack it. It has, however, happened that Desmarests

have attacked and killed in a travelling-box one of their number
which got itself wedged in a hole in a partition. The claws and
beaks of my birds occasionally require cutting, but this abnormal
growth may be partly due to disturbances in health consequent
on parasitic infection.

A new series commenced with the volume for 1903, which contained
no less than twelve coloured plates, one by Astley and all the others,
hand-coloured lithographs, by Gronvold and Goodchild, and of
excellent quality. The first depicts the family of Blue Wrens (Malurus
cyanens) in the aviary of Reginald Phillipps, who continues his ex-
haustive account of the breeding of the species to which I referred
in my previous article.
Astley writes on the Hooded Siskin (Chrysomitris cucullata ) of which
he contributes a nice coloured plate. He discovered at Santa Cruz
birds which were termed " Mista Canaria ", which he found were
hybrids between the cock of this species and the hen wild Canary.
The Hooded Siskin, with its brilliant orange dress, inhabits Central
America and is now, as then, a rare and much sought after cage bird,
especially desirable for hybridization with the Canary.
Bonhote contributes a series of articles on the birds of the Bahama
Islands which he had visited, and publishes a good photograph of an
Osprey which he reared from the nest and brought home.
Mrs. Johnstone supplies a very interesting account of the nesting
of the Satin Bower Bird in her Suffolk aviaries. Five of these birds,
all in the green plumage, were kept in a large aviary and, in the
spring, a typical bower was constructed amongst some rhododendron
bushes. "All five birds assembled here, and the curious rolling
trilling song of the cocks was continually heard, and their love dances
watched with much interest by the hens which never helped in the
building of the bower or of the decoration thereof." The two interesting
points here are : (1) the fact that all five birds agreed, and (2) that
young cocks still in their green plumage constructed the bower.

Then a nest, formed of loose twigs and resembling that of a Crow,
was built in a rhododendron bush about 36 feet away from the
bower, and only visited by the pair of birds to which it belonged.
The cock bird kept guard on the nest and attacked any other bird
that might approach, but he did not feed the hen when on the nest.
He was thought to be the oldest of the party, but was still in green
plumage though the back of his neck was pencilled with purple. Two
young were hatched after an incubation period of three weeks, during
which they were fed by the hen upon mealworms, gentles, and cock-
roaches, the latter being first favourites. Snails were never touched*
and earthworms only occasionally, while the soft food that was the
staple diet of the old birds was completely ignored as food for the
young. The young birds left the nest at four weeks, when they looked
very much like young Thrushes with violet-coloured eyes. They were
fed all day by their devoted mother, but she was unable to supply
their growing needs in the way of live insect food. The great mistake
had been in leaving other insect-eating birds in the same aviary which
took a great deal of the food needed by the young ones. So both died,
and thus complete success was not achieved.
W. H. St. Quintin contributes an interesting note on Tragopans
in captivity. It is now well known that these birds always make their
nests, or take possession of those of some other bird, at some considerable
height from the ground. St. Quintin writes : "In the last three
seasons I have had six clutches of eggs laid by four different individual
Tragopans, (two Cabots and two Temininck's). In each case the eggs
were laid in a Pigeon's nest, or on a platform resembling one, from
eight feet to fourteen feet from the ground. Each of these clutches con-
tained only two eggs." He also points out the high state of development
of the chick at hatching.
A note in this volume records the fact that among the more notice-
able additions to the Zoological Society's collection during 1900 was
a female Lyre Bird (Menura superba) of which no specimen had been
exhibited since 1876. I can remember that bird quite well in the
Western Aviary, which was an aviary in those days. I cannot find the
record of its death, but am under the impression that it lived for three
or four years and upon dissection proved to be a young male ! No
specimen has reached this country since.

Phillipps, while the next two plates, which are by Gronvold, and of
superb quality, depict the West African or Black-necked Crowned
Crane {Balearica pavonina) , of which Mrs. Gregory writes an interesting
story. Then comes a coloured plate of the Blue-bearded Jay ( Cyano -
corax cyanopogon ) with an article by A. G. Butler followed by one of the
Black-headed Sibia with an accompanying article by Phillipps.
St. Quintin supplies a valuable article on Waders, which he con-
sidered " the most charming of pets ". His Waders' aviary was 73 feet
long and 31 feet wide, with a lean-to shed at the north end, and a
pond with a stream running through it near the opposite end, about
21 feet by 10 feet. Yews and hollies, kept low, afforded shelter on
the east, and it was found necessary to board up the sides to a height
of eighteen inches to provide additional shelter and prevent the
occupants, when newcomers, " from fretting up and down against
the wire netting." He found that the majority of species, especially
if full-winged, were quite indifferent co any frost, even in East York-
shire. During the summer certain birds other than the Waders were
also kept in the aviary, the most attractive being some half-dozen
Pratincoles which " charmed everybody by their agile flight and lively
movements, running along the gravel, chasing flies which visited the
food dishes, or hovering like Terns before the door if they thought I
had some mealworms ".
St. Quintin was a most experienced aviculturist, and so his recipe
for the food of Waders is worth taking note of. He writes : " My
Waders scarcely ever see a mealworm, but they manage to capture
a good many insects which find their way into the aviary, especially
in spring and summer. Twice a day a flat dish is put in, containing

insect food (dried corixae and ants' cocoons, I believe), and made
into a crumbly mass with ground oats. Another dish contains some
finely chopped sheep's heart, liver, or rabbit, but the former is the
best."
It was in November, 1902, that the Varied Lorikeet ( Ptilosclera
versicolor) was introduced into this country for the first time, and it is
the subject of an excellent coloured plate by Goodchild in the July
(1903) number, to which Reginald Phillipps contributes an article.

to the group known as Hemipodes in which the female is considerably
larger and more brilliantly coloured than the male and, when nesting
time comes round, does all the courting. I was able to watch the
display of the hen-bird and to note the way she presented food to the
cock and produced her booming call-note ; and was able to describe
the incubation of the three eggs by the cock in the incredibly short space
of twelve days, after which he led his brood from the nest like a barn-
door hen, while their mother not only took no interest in them, but
wandered off and continued to call for another mate.
One is apt to hear the remark that the seasons are changing for
the worse, but one cannot imagine a worse breeding season than that
of 1903. It was particularly bad in the southern and eastern half of
England when, as Meade-Waldo tells us, 4 4 the almost unprecedented
deluge continued almost without intermission from the 9th to the 21st of
June." For forty-eight hours the maximum temperature was 48* and
the minimum 28* F., with a rainfall of 1*23 inches. This practically
annihilated the nests and eggs of many birds. Tits in nest-boxes were
starved and perished from the cold, as did Wrynecks, Nuthatches, and
even Jackdaws and Stockdoves. Young Barn Owls starved, owing to
their parents being unable to hunt for food in the continuous rain,
while House Martins lost all their nests. In an aviary a Chinese
Painted Quail was drowned on her nest, and a couple of young Pintailed
Sand Grouse a fortnight old perished.
The late A. J. Campbell, of Melbourne, well-known as the author
of that extremely useful book, Nests and Eggs of Australian Birds , con-
tributed a delightful article on Honey-Eaters in which he describes
the aviaries of his friends, Mr. and Mrs. Horne, and their niece, Miss
Bowie. I had the pleasure of visiting these charming people, with
Mr. Campbell, at a later date, and was delighted by the tameness of
the numerous Australian birds in their aviary in a Melbourne garden.
There were few aviculturists in Australia then, but there are many now.
This volume, of which we were all very proud at the time, ends
with an account by St. Quintin of his success in breeding Ruffs and
Reeves for the first time in confinement in this country.

H. HAM PE-BREEDING THE RED-FACED LOVEBIRD
BREEDING EXPERIMENTS WITH THE RED-

(Agapornis pullaria)

<bodyText confidence="0.99889659375" page_id="56322728"  page_num="128" year="" vol="">
My breeding experiments with Agapornis pullaria , about which I
wrote in the Avicultural Magazine, 1937, page 148, and 1938,
page 58, were continued in 1938. On 6th February, after successfully
wintering in an unheated room, the old female was placed with her
new mate in her old garden aviary. There I saw the female, for the
first time, on 27th March, again at the entrance to the hole in the
clay wall, and a month later she began to peck at the hole. On 16th
June, however, she began to make a new hole about 10 cm. away from
the old one. When, on the next day, I closed up the old entrance hole
with a thin layer of mud, and removed the existing perch from the
new hole, the hen took up with the old hole again and worked so
diligently that by July last she could reach the already existing nest-
hole. In the preceding year she had taken over this hole, made by the
female which had died on 1st February, 1937, without further ado
and without pecking much at it. This year, however, she was not
satisfied until after I had closed the hole with mud, and had thus
given her opportunity of satisfying her building impulse.
In 1939, therefore, I will close up the hole from the beginning,
and think that the female will then soon begin with the work of pecking
it out. That the true nest-hole already exists evidently does not
worry her, for in freedom when the birds have pecked through the
side of an anthill they will probably also find more or less ready-made
holes which they can use for laying their eggs. The birds are satisfied
when they have only made the entrance hole.
From 15th July the female slept at nights in the hole, and on
28th July there were five eggs in it, of which one measured 21 x 16,
and three 20 x 16*5 mm. On this occasion also the bottom of the hole
was thinly covered with pieces of willow leaves, which the female
had brought in in all parts of her small feathers.
On 15th and 16th August, a young one, which was covered with
whitish down, hatched out. It died, however, a day later. The
remaining eggs, which this time were all fertilized, came to nothing.

At the end of August the female concerned herself more often with
the hole and at the beginning of September also several pairings took
place. But soon after the commencement of the moult, the mating
instinct came to an end.
So nothing remains but to postpone once more the hope of a
complete breeding result. So far as I am concerned, in 1938 at least,
I have gone a step farther in the fact that, for the first time in years
of experiments a young one was produced. Eventually perhaps success
will be achieved.
[This is an extremely interesting experience as the Red-faced
Lovebird, although known to aviculturists for a very long time,
has apparently never yet reared young in captivity though there
are a few records of eggs having been laid. Its nesting habits
have always been rather a mystery.-- Ed.]

THE RING-NECKED PARRAKEET
(.Psittacula manillensis)
By Godfrey Davis

<bodyText confidence="0.9815977" page_id="56322729"  page_num="129" year="" vol="">
The garden from which I write is in Larkana, in Upper Sind,
and it is full of trees. Some of these trees are old and have holes
in the trunks and branches and already pairs of Ring-necked
Parrakeets can be seen clinging to the outside bark and discussing
nesting sites. The garden seems full of Parrakeets, and at almost
any time of the day their voices can be heard in some part of the
garden ; either they are flying swiftly and calling as they fly, or
they sit in the shade among the leaves, chattering to or among
themselves.
Though very common in India and a curse to the cultivator,
whose crops they constantly despoil, they are very lovely birds,
particularly in the early morning before the light is too harsh and
bright and the soft velvety smoothness of their plumage shows at
its best. Now at the end of January it is cold in the mornings,
and from 8 to 9 o'clock the Parrakeets sun themselves, perching
upon the dead branches of trees or upon any branch which stands
out exposed to the light. One can stand beneath the branches
and look up and see the bright beady eye, the shining red upper
mandible, so like a ripe red chilli, one of their favourite foods, and
the lovely pink and black ring round the neck of the male and the

long and elegant tail, and the feathers upon the head and breast,
as smooth as a dove. And one sees them as one rides in the morning
along the dusty country roads, if roads these sandy cart tracks
can be called, feeding upon grain which has fallen from the laden
carts, paddy or rice in the husk, and in its season, corn. As the
birds fly up at one's approach, one sees the full beauty of the male,
the lovely green, the swift flight, the long and slender tail.
And when taken young from the nest they make most charming
pets. In this part of India young are generally available in March,
though in South India they nest earlier, in January or February,
and basketsful of half-fledged young can be seen in the bird market
in Bombay. One rupee would be a very good price for a fledgeling
Ring-necked, and eight annas more for a fledgeling Alexandrine,
the so called " Hill-Parrot 55 of the Indians, because it comes from
the hilly country in the west and central India, with the distin-
guishing red mark upon the wing. Both the Ring-necked and
Alexandrine are the easiest things to rear upon a simple paste of
parched gram flour mixed with water to the consistency of putty.
If little bits of this be broken off, rolled into a pellet between
finger and thumb, and then put into the fledgeling's beak, the
young of both Ringnecks and Alexandrines will thrive upon this
simple diet. And when I read in the Avicultural Magazine of
young Australian Parrakeets being fed upon a chewed-up mixture
of brown bread and apple (and is there raw egg too ?), I wonder
whether a plain diet of parched or toasted gram flour and water
would not do. But fledgeling Malabar Parrakeets will not thrive on
this. I once lost two out of three on this diet, though the third I saved
and it grew into a lovely bird, on a simple diet on which Dr. Amsler
fed with such success his Blue Mountain Lorikeets, ground rice,
milk, and honey sugar, made as rice mould is made for the table,
and about which he once wrote in the Magazine years ago. Though
it may be necessary to keep Ring-necks in large aviaries if they
are to breed, they do keep in beautiful condition in comparatively
small wire cages. For instance, only the other day upon a station
platform, I saw a cock Ring-neck in lovely plumage and very tame
and friendly in a strong wire cage with rounded top, not more than
a foot in diameter and eighteen inches high, at least that is
what I judged it without measurement. But it was not one of the
small dome-shaped cages made of hoop iron with a sheet-iron floor,

which one sees, alas, so often hanging in the bazaars, but a cage of
strong galvanized wire with a clip-on bottom, after the style of the
Chinese bird cage. Probably also the owner let the bird out of its
cage, as tame Parrakeets commonly are.
When the young fledgeling can feed itself it is still fed largely on
gram, but the gram is not roasted or parched as when it is to be
made into flour. The gram, which is a sort of pea, is soaked
overnight in water, and fed in the morning to the birds ; they are
also often given fresh fruit, guava, and mango in season, ripe red
chillies and green vegetables, such as Wali-sang, a sort of country
scarlet runner, and indeed the wild flocks play havoc in the
vegetable gardens and orchards. Particularly do the birds love
the half-ripe mangoes when they are of the consistency of an
apple three-quarters ripe. I have often thought how hard it is for
Parrots to be fed largely on hard seed, seeing how small a part hard
seeds must fill in the dietary of a wild Parrot throughout the year.
When no cultivated crops or fruits are available the Ring-neck
feeds upon wild fruits or seeds, the wild fig or the seeds within the
husks of the tali tree. They are purely vegetarians and fresh
vegetarians at that, for choice, and they also drink something
stronger than water wdien they can get it. They join the noisy
throng of Mynas and Rosy Pastors and Bulbuls and Sunbirds on
the silk cotton trees when in February the lovely scarlet flowers
appear and offer free drinks of nectar to the birds. In captivity,
or perhaps I should say domestication (because the Ring-neck is
essentially a pet and should be made much of and not kept, a
mere captive, in a cage), the Ring-neck when hand-reared, as he
should be, is both affectionate and talkative, and a good listener,
too ; too affectionate sometimes, when he not only postures, as he
does to his wild mate on a branch of a tree, but regurgitates his
food. Above all, he is a bird that can be kept with a good con-
science, for while ever so much good can be said of him when he is
tame, ever so much bad can be said of him when he is wild, and
it is a pity that an ordered and supervised transport cannot make
him more easily available to bird lovers at home. I shall miss him
when I retire, though I like to think I shall be able to keep and
breed a pair in an orchard in England ; and Mynas and Doves
and Bulbuls and Grey Partridges, and lots of other birds. How
rarely do dreams come true.

Kofu is an old provincial town, the capital of Yamanashi province
in Japan. There is a public park called Yuki Park, which is
situated in the centre of the town, with a small zoo attached to it.
Here many Herons of local species and other water birds are kept
in a small flying cage. In 1936 a Night Heron (Nycticorax n.
nycticorax) and a Little Egret (Egretta g. garzettci) mated, and three
eggs were laid ; however, only two hatched, and the chicks reached
maturity. I saw these curious hybrids when I visited the park
during the summer of 1938. There is a remarkable difference in
plumage between them, although the shape of the body is similar,
being intermediate between the two parents ; their bills are
somewhat less pointed than those of the Egret, and not as heavy as
the Night Heron. They perch quietly on a tree with their necks
well tucked into the body, resembling the Night Heron, but the
hinder part is more elongated like the Egret. The colour of the bill
is black, and the legs a pale ashy white ; the iris is pale flesh
colour, an intermediate colour between the silver eyes of the Egret
and reddish brown of the Night Heron. They have no ornamental
plumes behind the head. The darker bird in the cage appeared
somewhat larger, so it may be a male. Its head is white, gradually
becoming blacker towards the neck. The rest of the body is black,
but the back of the wing-coverts is ashy white. The whiter bird
looked smaller, most likely a female. It is whitish, but has
asymmetrical black feathers on the back. We recall that Dr. Kuroda
recorded in " Tori ", about ten years ago, a similar hybrid in the
Fukuoka aquarium in Kyushu, so the present record forms the
second ever to have been reported from Japan ; and to my know-
ledge it has never been known in any other country.

Subscriptions of members of the Avicultural Society are due on the first
of January in each year, and the majority observe this Rule. However, though
it is now the fourth month of the year many have not yet paid. It is hoped that
this will in all cases be remedied within the next few weeks. The Editor feels
that when it is pointed out that it is very hard on the Society's Secretary and
Treasurer to have to spend summer days indoors writing letters and acknow-
ledging subscriptions, all readers will make an effort in future to send their
subscriptions early in the year. Editors come and Editors go, but the invaluable
Secretary and Treasurer has carried on year after year of unremitting work to
the great benefit of the Society, and it is to make that work at least less arduous
at a time of year when she would wish to enjoy some relaxation that the
co-operation of members is most earnestly solicited.

The Avicultural Society of New Zealand is to be warmly congratulated
on its Tenth Annual Report and Bulletin , and also on the increase in membership.
As the Hon. Secretary and Treasurer states in his report, " The greater our
membership the more useful we can be and, while we cannot hope to attain
the numbers of the parent body in England, we do at the present time have the
satisfaction of knowing that we are the second largest Avicultural Society in
existence in the British Empire." The members of the Avicultural Society of
New Zealand may be assured that the parent body in England watches their
progress with the greatest interest and feels justly proud of its active offspring
across the seas.

Dr. Derscheid in his article " The Preservation of Waterfowl and Aviculture "
in the March number of the Avicultural Magazine pointed out the value of
co-operation between aviculture and bird preservation. The need of this is further
evidenced by the new Editor of the New Zealand Report and Bulletin, the Rev. H.
Ranston, who in his foreword states, " One of the objects of our Society is the
study of and the conservation of our New Zealand birds both at liberty and in
captivity. ... As things are in our bushlands, some species of our natives are
doomed to sure extinction unless expert bird keepers are allowed to breed them
under suitable aviary conditions." It is hoped that this matter will be given
the earnest consideration of the authorities and of aviculturists in New Zealand,
for in this country, perhaps more than in any other, the avifauna has suffered
so greatly from unfortunate introductions and unwise interference with forests
and other vegetation.

The New Zealand Report and Bulletin contains much interesting and informa-
tive matter well put together, but space does not permit reference to all the
articles and notes which appear. Of particular interest, however, is an account
of the breeding of Spinifex Doves by M. E. Fitzgerald. It is a pity that the Latin
name is not given for, though everyone in Australasia undoubtedly knows
what a Spinifex Dove is, the name does not convey anything to many aviculturists
outside that area. If the Latin name Lophophaps plumifera had been added those
who are not acquainted with the common local name of Spinifex would
immediately realize that it was the Plumed Ground Dove, by which name it is
more generally known. The inclusion of the Latin name of any species is strongly
advocated, for this is the international means of identification and greatly adds
to the value of any article.
Dr. F. D. Pinfold contributes an informative article on Psittacosis in which he
explains the means of infection and symptoms of this disease. He states that
the disease can be controlled by scrupulous attention to cleanliness and con-
cludes by stating, " I firmly believe that the public imagination and a brainless
officialdom in certain parts of the world have magnified the risks and dangers
from this disease, an uncommon and fairly localized disease, to the detriment
of the real bird lover the world over."

THE FIRE AT CLERES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99102075" page_id="56322741"  page_num="141" year="" vol="">
I have greatly appreciated the sympathy expressed to me by the members
of the Avicultural Society in the painful loss that I recently sustained of many
cherished possessions in the fire which has entirely destroyed the contents of the
Chateau at Cleres. The loss of the Zoological Library and of all my notes and
correspondence on birds is particularly deplorable. For the second time in some
twenty years the ruin of my home has been recorded in the Avicultural Magazine,
and our older members will remember that of Villers-Bretonneux in 1918, when
not only the Chateau but the aviaries, birds, and gardens were destroyed by heavy
shelling and fighting.
In the present case, fortunately, the grounds have not suffered, and all the
animals and birds are safe in their usual quarters. Even the buildings known
as the Tower of Justice and the Manor House are untouched. Although it is feared
that a complete restoration of the Chateau to its previous state will not be possible,
there is little doubt that the outside can soon be repaired and recover its normal
aspect and the Manor House turned into a new residence.
I naturally intend to maintain the live collections at Cleres and even to increase
them as a compensation for the loss of irreplaceable treasures.
The cordial sympathy shown to me on this sad occasion by ornithologists
and aviculturists the world over has been a great encouragement and I take this
opportunity to thank them and express my deep appreciation.

Many aviculturists, together with the public generally, seem to have but a
vague idea of the meaning of these two words. One meets a traveller from, say,
Africa or Australia, who says that in his travels he met with many varieties of
Sunbirds or Honeyeaters. These were not varieties but species. Varieties in Nature
are rare ; it is true that a few species are variable, the Ruff being a case in point,
and one sometimes sees a white or pied Blackbird or a pale-coloured Greenfinch.
These are varieties, but Nature does not produce them to any extent. It is only
when Man takes a hand in managing a species that varieties begin to appear.
Take as an example the Budgerigar. There is only one species, and I believe
there are one or two records of a yellow variety occurring in Nature ; but by
careful breeding and selection under domestication, a number of varieties have
been produced.
So let us not talk about the many varieties of foreign birds in our aviaries, or
the many varieties of wild birds we have seen during a country walk. They are
all good species unless we refer to some that, for some reason or other, are abnormal.

WHERE ARE THE VERSICOLOR PHEASANTS?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.967022272727273" page_id="56322742"  page_num="142" year="" vol="">
Although I have not kept any Pheasants since 1913, I have been reading
the Avicultural Magazines for the last three years, in nearly every one of
which somebody extols the beauties of Golden and Amherst Pheasants ; I grant
that they are gaudy " Eye-catchers ", but to my mind do not compare in beauty
to the Versicolor Pheasant--of which I can find only one brief reference, to the
effect that four were reared by M. Delacour last year.
What has happened to these lovely little Pheasants ? They were com-
paratively common in the years before the War, but I personally have not seen
a pure one since the War, and of all the true Pheasants they are surely the most
beautiful. While on the subject of Pheasants, I was shown a most amazing hybrid
the other day, which if I had not seen I should hardly have believed, as I should
not have thought it was a possible cross. The bird was a three-year-old cock
Amherst X Monal ! In shape exactly half-way between the two parents, in
colour a uniform deep steel throughout, each feather highly metallic, but no
brilliant colouring, a small patch of dirty white on the lower breast. The owner
was contemplating presenting it, as a skin, to the British Museum, as I under-
stood that they were sceptical about the bird ! Even did the owner not know
the breeding of the bird, anyone acquainted with Pheasants would know what
cross it was immediately on seeing the bird.

FOOD AND BREEDING OF AVADAVATS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994344473684211" page_id="56322742"  page_num="142" year="" vol="">
I have often wondered on what the little flocks of Avadavats and Silverbills
one sees so often in desert country feed as there is little grass or grass seeds,
until one day I saw a flock of Silverbills alight on the tall pampas grass, called
locally " Sar " grass, which grows freely by water channels in this sandy country.
The plumed heads of this pampas grass bent from the vertical to the horizontal
even under the light weight of these little birds, and when I picked some heads
of this giant grass, growing as it does some 20 feet high, I found it full of tiny
seeds. On these seeds the tiny birds feed and sustain life. Also they use it when
soft to line their nests. I send herewith a little for you to see.
Another point on Avadavats. I have bred Avadavats in a small cage 24 inches
long by 14 inches high by 14 inches wide, with a square box 6 inches by 6 inches
with the lower 3 inches of the front closed in, hung on one end of the cage, but
the hens were constantly troubled with egg binding. I gave them tiny white
snail shells crushed up for grit and they ate this greedily, but still the eggs were
soft-shelled and passed only after great difficulty. Then in despair I put a pair
into a much bigger cage, 40 inches long by 20 inches wide and 26 inches high,
and the hen then started to lay eggs in the nest-box in that cage without any
difficulty. I came to the conclusion that lack of wing exercise was the cause of egg
binding in my hen Avadavats.

By Walter E. Higham
Our new Editor, Miss Barclay-Smith, has asked that I should
write an article on the Budgerigar and, as there appears to have
been little said about this lovely little Grass Parrakeet in these
columns in recent years, perhaps some comments may now not be
out of place.
I have spent the greater part of my life photographing wild
birds in my leisure hours. This still is my main hobby.
However, about nine or ten years ago I underwent such a
severe operation that the doctors handed me an ultimatum, telling
me that climbing trees, descending cliffs, meals at all hours, etc.,
did not blend with my physical condition.
I was so depressed with my general outlook that as a means of
" taking my mind off myself", my wife took me to a well-known
seaside resort, and, of all places, we wandered on to the amusement
park.
There she was the lucky (or unlucky) winner of a Budgerigar
which was handed to her in a paper bag !
Being rather horrified with our position, we hastened to the
nearest bird shop to obtain a cage. The assistant told us that
unless we bought a second, the bird would pine away for want of
a mate and so " like lambs for the slaughter " we were persuaded
to purchase a mate.
From that period I went, in small stages, from the owner of
a pair of very mediocre birds to last year, when my stock ran into
over 2,000 birds of over thirty different types or varieties.

W. E. HIGHAM-THE BUDGERIGAR IN CAPTIVITY
Without any doubt at all, to-day the Budgerigar is one of our
most popular cage birds. And when one considers why, the
reasons are not very difficult to find.
Firstly, the birds themselves are very attractive indeed ; their
colours now being so numerous, those who desire an odd bird or a
pair have a wide choice, and can easily suit their own particular
taste or fancy. Then, again, these birds are extremely hardy and
their feeding and keep are particularly simple. The recent
publicity on the wireless of the talking " Budgie " has created
a tremendous demand for young birds suitable to be trained as
talkers and, lastly, there are few birds that breed more prolifically
or are easier to rear. These points as a whole must encourage
a beginner when he considers the " pros and cons 55 as to what
variety of bird life he shall commence with.
I do not propose to start now by giving readers a brief account
of how to manage a stud of Budgerigars ; there are several adequate
books dealing with this subject already on the market. To any
readers wishing to start keeping these birds I suggest they first of
all buy one of these books, secondly, join the Budgerigar Society,
and, thirdly, buy a copy of The Book of Budgerigar Matings , issued by
that Society.
What I intend to do is to give one or two tips which existing
breeders may not have tried, and one or two remarks which are
probably not covered in the text-books.
Firstly, in regard to feeding, there is a considerable divergency
of opinion as to the ideal Budgerigar mixture. Many breeders
do not trouble to mix their own seeds, being content to buy some
mixture ready prepared. However, the larger breeders, and also
a lot of the thorough smaller breeders like to know exactly what
their mixture is and consequently mix their own. Picking up
the two most recent books on Budgerigars, I find that
Watmough's Cult of the Budgerigar recommends equal parts of millet
and canary seed with the addition of a quarter part of oats or
groats, and maybe a few handfuls of linseed to each stone of mixture
at certain times.
As against this, Frudd's book, Incomparable Budgerigars , recom-
mends for breeding purposes : one-third Mazagan Canary seed
(not too large, but of a good quality), one-third best white millet,
and one-third Indian millet. In cold weather a few groats may be

given separately, but as the season advances this heating food
should be cut out and green food substituted. Some of the earlier
books have very divergent views to these. I myself, having had
thousands to feed, have tried out quite a few experiments, and,
when I was in Toulouse visiting Messieurs Bastide and Blanchard,
I noticed that their birds were fed on practically nothing but a
poor quality yellow millet. On my return home, after my first visit
to Toulouse, I started my feeding experiments and, after six years,
I am of the very definite opinion that yellow millet, as a staple
food, is very good indeed. My seed mixture this last season has
been : yellow millet half, a good pearl white millet quarter, and
a quarter bold Spanish canary. During the coldest winter months
a small quantity of groats is added. My percentage of millet is
far higher than that generally recommended, but after several
visits to the Toulouse establishments and the knowledge of the
condition of my own stock, I shall need quite a lot of convincing
that I am not on the right lines.
I give you herewith Watmough's figures for canary seed and

Round about a month before the breeding season I commence
giving my birds cod-liver and halibut oil, the mixture consisting
of one part halibut oil to nine parts cod-liver oil. The approximate
amount of this mixture added to the seed is one teaspoonful to
every pint of seed. It is important that the seed should be very
well agitated to make sure that the oils are evenly mixed with it.
The birds when feeding break the seed husk to eat the content,
and in doing this they are forced to consume some of the oil which
is on the outside of the husks.
Another tip in this direction is the treatment of birds suffering
from gastric troubles such as enteritis.
It has been my usual course to administer bismuth carbonate,
or some similar alkali, when a bird is suffering from this type of
ailment. Often a bird is so ill that any shock such as forcible
feeding with a fountain-pen filler, or any similar method, would
probably prove fatal. I administer the bismuth in the following

way. I soak the seed in cod-liver oil, then put the seed into the
bismuth powder and the bird then consumes the bismuth in the
same way as she gets her halibut and cod-liver oil, as I have
already detailed.
Up to the present the cages used for the housing of Budgerigars
has left much to be desired in the way of sanitation.
The pet " Budgie 55 cage, the breeders stock cage, and even the
exhibitors training cages--in fact, every type of cage--suffers from
one and the same fault--the birds walk about, eat and play amongst
their excreta. It does not need much imagination to realize that
this is far from ideal.
During the last season I have experimented with a new type
of cage bottom. We use in each cage a wire tray constructed of
f-inch square mesh. The wire used is 16 s.w.g. galvanized, and
the whole is stiffened round the edge by an outside wire made of
something like 14 s.w.g.
This wire tray is suspended about S to 1 inch from the main
tray or bottom of the cage. It is easy to suspend the wire tray,
and the most simple method is to nail on a small wood flange
round the sides of the cage, resting the wire tray on top of this.
A word of warning must be given, however, to see that the
wire tray is electrically welded, or, if this is not the case and solder
is used, great care must be observed to see that no loose particles
of solder are left on the tray, as this would probably prove fatal
if any of your birds consumed it.
If anyone has any doubts about the efficiency of this method,
I suggest he or she try out the idea on one cage only.
Put in clean perches in this cage and put also clean perches
in one of the older type. At the end of the month examine the
two sets of perches and I think the answer will be obvious.
In this issue there is a frontispiece of four of the more recent
arrivals in the land of the " Budgie ". This plate in no small measure
faithfully represent the varieties in question. The bird on the
top right is the Opaline Dark-green. The one below is a fine
example of a cock Whitewing Cobalt. The bird depicted not
only well illustrates the variety but shows to advantage the points
of a modern show Budgerigar. This bird faithfully represents the
type set down as the ideal by the Budgerigar Society. Note the
shape of the head, the body, and the general carriage. Note also

the shape and position of the wings. The third bird from the top
is a typical example of the Yellow-wing Dark-green, whilst the
lowest bird represents the " Yellow-faced 55 or " Golden-faced 53
variety Cobalt in a very natural attitude.
The Whitewings and Yellow-wings originated first in Australia,
in fact, though the varieties are fairly new over here, these birds
have been bred " down under 35 for several seasons. The Opalines
funnily enough appeared in both Australia and Great Britain about
the same time and, as both want to claim the distinction, we had
better say the origin was a double one.
The Golden-faced variety, which is the more recent arrival
of the four, as far as I know originated in Great Britain. For those
who are interested in the genetics of these birds, the Whitewings
and Yellow-wings breed normally, the Opalines are sex-linked and
the Golden-faced birds are dominants.
It is an interesting point that whenever a new variety arrives,
whether it be in this country, Germany, or Australia, more often
than not, the same, or similar, variety breaks out from unrelated
stock, round about the same time.
Some keepers of our birds are content with their small lean-to
aviary, others have palatial garden aviaries, adorned with expensive
decorations. Some have one pet bird in a cage, others hundreds of
show birds caged up for the show season. Some people breed birds
just for the excitement and hope of breeding something no one else
has yet bred. Others pair up their birds to breed the finest show
bird that has ever been benched. Some like to see the birds flying
about a sheltered outside aviary, whilst one or two have even tried
to develop a stud of homing Budgerigars, birds that can leave
their pens like Pigeons.
Others are using our bird as a means of furthering their know-
ledge in animal genetics. It has been proved that the Budgerigar
lends itself admirably in this direction.
All these different spheres attract thousands of enthusiasts all
over the country and it is amazing to think that fifty years ago
it was more common to see one on a fair ground perched on a
fortune-teller's finger than anywhere else, and coupled with this
any colour, other than the original green, was the exception, when
one realizes to-day the dozens of varieties we now possess.

These two Partridges of India are not true Partridges at all
but Francolins, but the Grey is one of the most charming of pets and
a great favourite among the poor. The chicks are easily obtained,
for in the dry and sandy country which they inhabit they are very
common and chicks a few days old are often caught by the boys
who take the village herds of cattle and goats and sheep to graze
in the scrub jungle. When taken young the chicks are easily reared
upon bajri, the lesser millet, and white ants which abound in the
jungle, but it is useless taking them when they are half or even
quarter grown. Chukor, the handsome Partridge from the
Baluchistan hills, can be easily tamed when taken adult, but not
so the Grey or the Black Partridge. Instead of a tame and confiding
bird one has a timid and frightened captive which, if one has
any pity, one frees.
The chicks are easily reared upon bajri which is a common
grain, a tiny grey-green seed upon which all young game birds
thrive. Indeed, I had failed to rear some Guinea-fowl chicks upon
a careful diet of hard-boiled egg and lettuce, and they all died when
about three weeks old, of what I can only think was
" staggers ", if there be such an illness among Guinea-fowl chicks,
because these unfortunate chicks literally could not stand, their
legs giving way beneath them. Our cook, Peter Fernandez, who
owns the Bulbuls, took charge of the next clutch of eggs when the
hen was killed by a jackal, when on her nest which she had concealed
from us, and put them under a broody hen. He and the hen
between them reared the chicks only on bajri and broken rice and
chopped onion tops, which Peter Fernandez said were very good,
and on chopped lucerne. These chicks, now grown up, strut about
the garden and the neighbouring plain with a fine disregard of my
humiliation. But bajri must be a very good and tasty seed for the
Grey Partridge, when grown up, will eat little else. Juwari, or the
greater millet, or the dari of commerce, they merely throw out of
their food jars. Even Black Partridges are fonder of bajri though
they will take juwari more readily than the Grey ; also, in the hot

weather, my Mali, or gardener, who looks after the birds, will soak
dal or lentils in water overnight to give to the Black Partridges to
cool their blood. The Grey Partridge in winter is given pellets of
channa or parcher gram flour mixed with water about which I
have written, but neither Grey Partridges nor Black Partridges are
given water in winter. It is said it gives them colds and it is true
that when these birds are given water in winter they are apt to
get a cold or " snuffles " which is really difficult to cure. But they
are given a green food of which they are very fond. It is like a wild
yellow clover and is called " Sinji 55 and grows in all cultivation.
Of this Partridges are very fond and will pick off the leaves through
the bars of their bamboo cages. When this Sinji fades the leaves
give the scent of a hay-field. Black Partridges will also eat the
yellow blossoms of an oil seed called Jambu or Sirieh, which is
even now growing among the wheat in the fields. A field of Jambu
looks like a field of mustard ; it is a lovely rich yellow and with it
grows another oil seed called, Sirieh ; this is a pale sulphur yellow,
but both are rich in oil. The oil is extracted in small mills in the
houses of the oilmen and the shaft of the mill is pulled round in a
circle by a blindfolded bullock. Only a few days ago I heard the
loud, clear, ringing calls of Grey Partridges behind the Circuit
House where I was staying and there were two pairs of Grey
Partridges, with their domed bamboo cages gaily decorated with
blue beads, set down in a patch of yellow Jambu and Sirieh flowers,
while there were also two Black Partridges, each in its own domed
cage. One Black Partridge was one of the finest birds I have seen
and one was much smaller, and when I asked why one was so
much bigger than the other I was reproved, though unintentionally.
The big Partridge, I was told, was the Partridge of a rich man.
Still, I noticed it had only red Juwari in its food jar. Its cage was,
however, bigger and it certainly got more attention than its poorer
brother, and more exercise and probably white ants, for the finding
of white ants takes time.
It is surprising the size the Grey Partridges grow in their
comparatively small cages. Generally the cages measure 12 inches
square and two are joined together with a communicating door
between. The framework is of light wood, generally only five inches
high, and through this framework the thin bamboo strips are
drawn and fixed somewhat in the shape of a tall inverted pointed
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.9983142" page_id="56322758"  page_num="150" year="" vol="">

basket, so that the birds, if frightened, should not hurt their heads
if they jump upwards ; and the bamboo framework is given a
concave inclination so that the bird, if frightened, jumps not only
upwards, but towards the highest part of the cage, the centre of the
dome or basket. In front of the framework in each cage is a small
door through which the tame Partridge enters and leaves its cage.
It is all very simple and ingenious and is the outcome of generations
of loving care of a people to whom the ways of the wild things are
familiar. And as Partridges when wild do not sit about in the open,
so each cage or pair of cages is fitted with a cover of some fine
textured cloth so that a shaded light only enters the cage and the
bird feels safe and protected, as in the protective shrubbery of the
fields. And this much care is taken of the birds, even by the poorest.
Only a few days back, when I was going with a friend to see
his date garden by the Indus, we passed some poor travelling lohars
or smiths who had set up their simple forge by the wayside under
some trees. Near by was a Partridge cage and next to it what they
call a Taat or Khotra or dusting cage, a bigger domed cage, some
2 ft. by 2 ft. with no bottom and which is placed on sandy ground
for the Grey Partridge to take his dust bath. So he goes from his
cage proper to his dusting cage and when I asked whether it was
not difficult to get him back again, again I was reproved. " Does
the Partridge not regard his cage as his house and will one not
return gladly to one's house ? " And yet again when I once asked
a tall Mohammedan who was followed along the country road by his
tame Partridge which followed like a dog, whether he was not
afraid to lose the bird, he pointed to the cage he was carrying,
in one compartment of which was the hen, and said, " Would a
gentleman Partridge ever leave his lady ? " How superior, I thought,
were the morals of Partridges to men ! The birds are the objects
of constant care and pride ; their cages are really their homes.
Only this morning I watched a coolie digging in the local park
while his fine cock Partridge, which appeared to me as big as a
Grouse, wandered and scratched and pecked near by where the
hen was in her cage upon the ground. Seeing my admiration he
stopped his work and whistled through his teeth, whereat the
Partridge answered with his loud ringing call. The hen was also
a fine bird, and she should be, said the coolie, because her mother
was an Irani or Persian lady !

While the Grey Partridges, with their warm and modest
colouring of browns and greys, almost autumn tints, and their soft
friendly murmurings as they are petted, always remind me of some
friendly hen, the Black Partridge is a dashing fellow and far more
like a Pheasant in his ways. Moreover, he loves the damp, salty
ground of the river banks and the cover of the thick Tamarisk or
lai bushes or tall Sar grass of the jungle. He does not like the dry
sandy country and the cultivation, as does the Grey Partridge,
and with the bold chequered patterns in black and white and his
jet black breast he approaches nearer to the decorative plumage of
the Pheasants. He also can be tamed if caught when he is very
young and I have two fine cock birds now which, when let out of
their cages in the morning, will rocket up in the sky and come
floating down on widespread wings. Yet in two hours they will
come back willingly to their small cages. The hen of the Black
Partridge also partakes more of the ways of a hen Pheasant than
does the hen Grey Partridge, which, but for her smaller size and
the absence of a spur, resembles the cock bird. Moreover, the Black
Partridge is rarely tamed as is the Grey. He is used chiefly as a
decoy. He is taken out in his covered cage to the fields and calls his
harsh, challenging cry, translated by the pious Muslim as " Khuda
tera Khudrat ", " God, thy glory." And when the wild cocks come
to his challenge they, poor things, are shot. They are fed in captivity
much as the Grey Partridge, but being bigger eat more of the greater
millet or Juwar. They will peck the yellow petals of the Jambu
flowers and the tender shoots of vetch or gram or Sinji. But while
the hen Grey Partridge will lay readily in captivity or I should more
truly say, in domestication, she will, when among friends, sit like
an old hen under a basket, the Black Partridge is a more difficult
proposition. He will take two or even three wives in captivity,
but the only man I know who bred them kept them in the breeding
season in a wired enclosure. And the poor Indian is right when he
prefers the Grey Partridge to the Black ; he prefers the more modest
and the more faithful creature. And I myself think I shall always
remember the Grey Partridges' clear ringing call coming in the
early morning over the awakening fields.

Volume II of the New Series, commencing in November, 1903,
contains only eight coloured plates, as it was found impossible to
stand the heavy expense of one every month, but all are of first-
rate quality and there are several good black-and-white illustrations
as well. The volume commences with a beautiful plate of the
Rufous-bellied Niltava (,Niltava sundara ) with a short article on the
species by Russell Humphrys.
St. Quintin writes on the nesting in confinement of the Waxwing,
a unique event, which was unfortunately not quite successful, though
young were hatched on two occasions.
In the previous volume Dr. Geo. Greswell had written on " The
influence of diet on the avian death-rate ", and given as his opinion
that the use of egg in food mixtures was the chief cause of
septicaemia in captive birds. This resulted in a considerable
amount of correspondence which is continued in the volume
under notice.
Needless to say, the experience of the majority of aviculturists
was hostile to a discontinuance of this item of diet for insectivorous
birds.
Frank Finn writes a good article on the Carolina Duck, which is
illustrated by a coloured plate by Goodchild. He remarks on the
close resemblance of the female to that of the Mandarin Duck, and
the curious fact that hybrids between the two are unknown. Close
observation has shown, however, that the relationship is not nearly
as close as would at first seem apparent. Hybrids between the
Carolina and other species are not rare, but for some unknown
reason the Mandarin refuses to interbreed with any other species.
Finn concludes by urging aviculturists to do all they can by breeding
the Carolina Duck to save a lovely species " from the fate which
awaits it ", but if he were alive now he would be pleased to hear
that on account of protection in the U.S.A. it has considerably
increased.
This volume contains several good articles on wild birds, which,

to my mind, add greatly to the value of the Magazine. The Rev. F. R.
Blathwayt writes on rambles amongst the Highland Lochs, and
describes the nesting there of the Black-throated Diver and others ;
W. H. Workman tells of " A Naturalists' ramble in Algeria ", and
of " Birds by an Irish Stream in Winter " ; while Captain Boyd
Horsbrugh gives " Some Field Notes in South Africa ", and Russell
Humphrys describes a ramble in Ceylon.
There is an excellent coloured plate by Goodchild of Guilding's
Amazon Parrot (.Amazona guildingi ) with an article by Canon Dutton
describing his experience with this rare species, peculiar to the
island of St. Vincent. Since the devastating hurricane on that island
this Parrot was thought to have been exterminated, but several
" only survivors " have turned up since.
The White-throated Ground-Thrush (Geocichla cyanonota) is the
subject of a beautiful coloured plate by Gronvold, with an exhaustive
article by Reginald Phillipps.
St. Quintin's article on the Great Bustard, which follows, is of
considerable interest, as he had much experience in keeping this
species. He found that the male does not get his spring plumage,
pectoral bands, and whiskers until the third summer and, until that
time, does not expand his pouch. He had kept this species for years
but, although many eggs had been laid, these were invariably
infertile, until June, 1901, when a young bird was hatched, the
only one in captivity in the British Isles before or since. Appearing
during a spell of cold weather, the young bird unfortunately died,
but the story, by Arthur Moody, who was for many years at
Scampston, is worth reprinting, since the event appears to be
unique.--"June 16, 1901 : The sitting hen Great Bustard has
hatched off, but I am sorry to say that the young one is dead. She
was due to hatch to-day, but I thought I had better keep an eye
on her a day or two before, so on Thursday and Friday I just went
near enough to the nest to see her sitting, and of course thought she
was going on well, as I could see no difference in her behaviour.
However, I took the precaution on Friday evening of putting a
board near her nest with a little meal, some ants' eggs, and meal-
worms upon it. J[ was going to do the same on Saturday morning
when the old bird came rushing from a different place and, on
going there, I found the young bird very weak and almost unable
to stand, with its eyes shut and looking very bad. By its emaciated

appearance, I should say it had been hatched two or three days,
and was suffering from want of food. I put all kinds of things round
it and climbed into a beech tree to see if the old one would feed it,
but she did not, though I watched for some time. She picked a
little of the flowering grass and dropped it near the young bird, but
it was too far gone to eat. I though the best thing was to cram
it with chopped mealworms, which I did several times, and to
leave the old one to brood it until evening. But it died about
5 p.m."
T. H. Newman writes on his experience in breeding hybrids
with various Doves of the genus Turtur , which all proved to be
fertile. The genus has since been altered in name, in fact split
up into several genera and some of his fertile hybrids were not
merely between two species of the same genus but between two
genera, e.g. Spilopelia and Streptopelia.
It has often been said that hybrids between genera are sterile,
and this might be so if we knew exactly what constitutes a genus.
Man has, for his convenience, distinguished certain groups as
genera, perhaps because one group possess a ring on the neck and
others do not, but nature evidently regards the Turtle Doves,
whether ring-necked or not, as a very closely-related group.
A coloured plate of the Bahama Amazon Parrot (Amazona
bahamensis) by Goodchild is perhaps rather too vividly coloured, but
a charming plate for all that. Bonhote, who writes on this bird,
had spent some time in those islands, and knew the species well.
He does not give it a particularly good character, considering that,
" apart from its beautiful coloration, it has but little to recom-
mend it."
An account appears of a rare Lorikeet obtained by
Mrs. Johnstone, which proved to be Weber's Lorikeet (Psitteuteles
weberi Buttikofer) from the island of Flores. At the time of its
arrival, there was no specimen in the British Museum, and, so
far as I am aware, no other living specimen has reached Europe
either before or since.
Meade-Waldo contributes an attractive article on " Nesting
Boxes for Wild Birds ". He writes, " The boxes we use and which
are almost always occupied year after year, are made by our own
carpenter, out of } in. oak plank for small birds, and i in. plank
for large birds. Those for small birds are usually 5 to 6 inches

hinge, the lid sloping and slightly projecting over the hole, which
should be near the top of the box, at the side or in front, it does not

diameter. I find an admirable way to attract Tits, Nuthatches,
Wrynecks, etc., is to nail a piece of stout bark across the hole so
as to make the hole too small for any bird ; and then the incoming
tenant chips the bark away to the size required. This has the effect
of keeping out House Sparrows ; but boxes placed low and away
from houses and out-buildings, are not much troubled by these
4 undesirables V 5 The article is illustrated by photographs, one of
which shows a box made of oak and put up in 1872.
Miss Alderson, writing on the breeding of the Rufous Dove
(Leptoptila reichenbachi) gives a very useful hint which applies to
other species of Doves and Pigeons as well. The dangerous time for
the young birds is just as they leave the nest, and Miss Alderson
says "it is essential to have a wooden crib (made of 11 in. high
floor-boards) on the aviary floor under the nest. The crib of course
filled with a good bed of straw and hay. If you neglect this simple
precaution, you will probably find your young birds dead or with
a broken wing on their first descent from the nest, for they are very
fragile little creatures, and their small bones are soft, and if startled
by other birds they may lose their hold and fall heavily, with fatal
results 55 .
Doves were more popular as aviary birds in 1904 than they
appear to be to-day, and Miss Alderson had many species which
she kept very successfully. I myself had a good many then, and in
the volume under notice I have recorded the breeding of the
attractive little Scaly Dove (Scardafella squamosa). But amongst
my most interesting birds at that time were some Tataupa Tinamous,
[Crypturus tataupa) whose nesting habits were strange as they were
interesting. Their story as well as portrait by Gronvold of adult
(and chick) is in this volume.
The Tinamous are a large group, inhabiting Central and South
America and, although superficially resembling the gallinaceous
birds, are, in reality, more closely allied to the Ratitae. In their
breeding habits they are polyandrous, a fact that I was able to
confirm, though it had been previously proved by M. Delaurier
with the Martineta Tinamou ( Calopezas elegans). The female

Tataupa is considerably larger than the male, and having paired
and produced a clutch of eggs for him to incubate, she goes in
search of a second mate and repeats the process, in this respect
resembling another group of which I have had some experience,
the Bustard Quails.
St. Quintin writes on Ravens' breeding in captivity. The young
birds grew up somewhat rickety, a condition he found to be due to
their having been fed principally upon the flesh of rabbits. "It
did not occur to me at the time," he writes, " but as a falconer, I
ought to have remembered that, though rabbit flesh is a good
change of food, especially in hot weather, Hawks cannot work hard
upon it, and, if fed too freely upon this meat, will rapidly lose con-
dition and stamina."
A. E. L. Bertling writes on the hatching and rearing of Brush
Turkeys at the Zoo, an event that has been repeated since, and
which is now an annual occurrence at Whipsnade. The hatching
of Crested Screamers ( Chauna cristata) at the Zoo is also recorded,
this being, probably, the first occasion upon which this species bred
in Great Britain, though they have done so again since then.
The incubation period was six weeks, the young, which somewhat
resemble goslings, being clothed in yellowish down.
Gronvold supplies a drawing of the young of the Painted Quails
(Excalfactoria) showing the difference between E. chinensis and the
Australian E. lineata , both of which had been bred in my aviary.
A. G. Butler writes on the Orange-billed Tanager (Saltator auranti-
irostris ), of which a good coloured plate by Gronvold appears.
This is followed by an excellent article by that fine old zoologist,
Dr. Albert Gunther, on the breeding in captivity of the Red-backed
Shrike. After his retirement from the British Museum, Dr. Gunther
found great pleasure in the study of aviculture, and the breeding of
this Shrike in his aviary at Kew was a great achievement.
An account by G. C. Porter of the breeding of the Red-faced
Lovebird (. Agapornis pullaria) is particularly interesting, since the
appearance in our last number of a similar account by Helmut
Hampe. In Mr. Porter's case the birds nested in a small box, with
half a coco-nut husk cemented inside, but exact details are lacking.
The owner discovered two young birds, practically reared, dead
on the floor of the aviary. I must admit that I had completely
forgotten this case, but so far as I know, it is still true that the young

One of our latest rare acquisitions is a beautiful little Waxbill,
which we have called, or rather styled, the Orange-Cheeked, or
more correctly the Tangerine-cheeked Cordon Bleu. It is a perfect
little Cordon Bleu in every respect, except that the cheeks, beak,
legs, and feet are tangerine colour, instead of the blood-red cheeks
and pinkish-blue beak and feet of the common Cordon.
It is the same size and has the same graceful shape of the lovely
little Cordon, with the same pretty song and chirp or call-note.
It also boasts the same pretty love dance or courting display, bobbing
up and down on the perch, with a long straw in the mouth, as it
edges closer and closer to its mate, uttering forth its fascinating
little song, so characteristic of the Blue Waxbill family.
The back and wings are mousey-brown, which colour also
extends over the head and back of the neck. It has a rich blue upper
breast and flanks, and an equally rich blue tail, gracefully running
to a sharp point, slightly curved upwards, thus giving a pleasing
finish to a neat little bird. The blue extends well up the sides
of the face, on which are painted two perfect orange or rather
tangerine-coloured patches, the same size as those prominent red
cheeks of the well-known Gordon. A significant contrast against
the clear-cut fawn-coloured lower breast and under parts are the
two orange-coloured legs and feet. The blending of these delicate
colours on such a spruce and alert little figure is a rare sight. Truly
a delight to the eyes of ornithologist and aviculturist alike.
Now, may I ask the question. What is he ? Is he a freak, or a
hybrid, or a new species ? If the latter then all credit and honour
goes to my wife for her keen observation and alertness in discovering
him. She does the doctoring and nursing, finds pleasure in
personally supervising the feeding and attending to the wants of

all the birds on the place, and it was during one of her rounds
that she picked out this fascinating little chap. Perhaps the effort
would be better appreciated were it known that there are some
three to four hundred small birds, including dozens of Gordon
Bleus, Orange-cheeks, and others all mixed together, flying about
in a fairly large aviary.
If a freak, then it is a marvellous specimen. For why should
the bird be so evenly marked and the lines so clear-cut and
distinct ? For instance, why should it have two orange cheeks ?
It might easily have had only one, instead of one on each side of
the face, so symmetrically placed. The blue of the breast could
easily have run irregularly into the fawn, and a pink instead of an
orange beak, and so on.
If considered a hybrid, between an Orange-cheeked Waxbill
and a Cordon Bleu, as one may easily imagine, then it could
easily have shown some evidence of the maroon rump or greyish-
white breast of the Orange-cheeked Waxbill, or the red cheeks
and pinkish-blue beak of the Gordon, but none of these possibilities
are present. Up to the present it is a problem to us all in South
Africa, aviculturist and ornithologist alike. Neither the South

African Museum, Gape Town, nor the Pretoria Museum, Transvaal,
can place it. In reply to my letter, Dr. Austin Roberts says of it :
" The bird you describe is not known to me, but may nevertheless
be one that has been described. I don't like to venture an opinion
about it, without seeing the bird itself. There are occasions when
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999170928571429" page_id="56322766"  page_num="158" year="" vol="">
pigments do not develop correctly, of which we have three cases
in the Black and Crimson Bush Shrike, in which the crimson has
turned out yellow."
To this I can only remark that the bird has passed through
one moulting season, while with us and there has been no change
in the colour of his plumage and every marking is the same. There
in the aviary he is, a bright-eyed perky little chap, and a puzzle
to everybody who has seen him. Again the common question
must be asked, What is he ?
He originates from the wilds of Senegambia, West Africa. It
is this thought that lingers in my mind, when trying to decide
whether he is a hybrid or not. If he had been bred in captivity,
it would perhaps have been an easy matter to say whether he is
the result of a cross between an Orange-cheek and a Cordon Bleu.

THE FIRST NESTING IN CAPTIVITY OF THE
AUSTRALIAN SHELD-DUCK
(Cas area tadornoides.)

<bodyText confidence="0.981713294117647" page_id="56322767"  page_num="159" year="" vol="">
Of the four species of Casarca , three have for several years,
bred freely in captivity : the Ruddy, Grey-headed (South
African), and Paradise (New-Zealand) Sheld-ducks. All are very
handsome, but extremely quarrelsome, which is a great drawback.
The Australian Sheld-duck, perhaps the most beautiful of all,
however, had so far seemed badly disposed to nesting under
artificial conditions. I have not heard of its having laid eggs, either
in Europe, in America, or in its native country, where it is known
under the name of " Mountain Duck ". Although closely related
to the others, particularly to the Paradise Sheld-duck, it has a
much longer neck, is more slender in shape, and, a very important
point, proves quite peaceful in a mixed collection, both with the
members of its own species as well as other Ducks and Geese. In
short, its behaviour is much more like that of the two Sheld-ducks
of the genus Tadorna , the European and the Radjah. In voice and
display, on the other hand, it closely reminds one of the other
Casarca.

l 60 J. DELAGOUR-NESTING OF THE AUSTRALIAN SHELD-DUCK
For a long time, the Australian Sheld-ducks were seldom brought
over, and considered decidedly rare in European collections. The
first to arrive after the war, a male and two females, came six or
seven years ago to Mr. Laidley, who kindly let me have them. They
lived for a few years, but never laid. Four years ago Mr. Goodwin
brought me another pair from Australia, and the last three years
a certain number have arrived, so that the species is now well
distributed in the collections of live waterfowl. At present, we keep
three pairs : the oldest pair in the garden, where they peacefully
live with many different Geese, Radjah Sheld-ducks and smaller
ducks ; and two pairs on the lake, where they have* been for two
years and also prove harmless.
Every year, in January or February, these birds come into
breeding condition, but so far nothing has happened, and in April
they go into moult.
This winter, in spite of the severe frost in December, they again
looked like breeding, and finally the female in the garden started
laying in a nesting-box half-buried in the ground on 2nd February.
Six eggs were laid at two-day intervals, the last on the 14th. The
colour of the down of the female covering the eggs is very light
grey. Mr. Fooks put them under a broody hen, and on 20th and
21 st March two eggs were chipped on the thirtieth day, and three
on the thirty-first, and finally five ducklings were hatched on the
thirty-second and thirty-third day of incubation, the sixth egg being
infertile.
The young look very lively. They resemble other Sheld-duck
chicks in shape and markings, but the latter are pale greyish brown,
therefore quite different from those of young Paradise Sheld-ducks,
which are black ; they are decidedly lighter in colour than
Ruddies and South Africans. They are also more slender in build,
and have yellowish-grey feet and legs.
I hope to be able to report later on the full and final breeding
in captivity of this interesting bird.

How the Law Stands in Northern Ireland
The following statement has been received from the Government
of Northern Ireland :--\0x25A0
Inquiries have been received from time to time from bird
fanciers and others regarding difficulties arising out of the proposed
importation of birds of the Parrot family into Northern Ireland
either from Great Britain or abroad, one recent example being that
of a Cockatoo which was " held up " at Stranraer in Scotland.
The Government of Northern Ireland wishes to point out that in
1930, with a view to preventing the spread of psittacosis, regulations
were made (and still exist) whereby as a general rule the importa-
tion of Parrots and certain birds of the same species is prohibited,
whether for sale or otherwise. There are, however, two exceptions
to the rule. Firstly, the case of any Parrot which is proved to the
satisfaction of the local Medical Officer of Health to be required for
purposes of medical or veterinary research. Secondly, the case of a
Parrot which is consigned to a person for the time being specially
authorized by the Ministry of Home Affairs to import birds other-
wise than for sale.
In the latter case, the Ministry issues a permit to the importer,
provided he furnishes the following documents :--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.817850571428571" page_id="56322769"  page_num="161" year="" vol="">
(a) a declaration to the effect that the bird has been three
years continuously or since birth in Great Britain, and has not
been in contact with any birds suffering from disease ;
(b) a further declaration to the effect that the bird is not for
resale, and
(c) a certificate from a duly qualified veterinary surgeon
to the effect that the bird is in good health.

Birds as Animals. By James Fisher. Heinemann, Ltd., London.
8vo. Price 12 s. 6 d. nett.
There has been a great advance in the study of birds during
the last twenty years, especially in field ornithology, and in the
present volume Mr. James Fisher gives a summary of our present
knowledge.
The first chapter is devoted to a brief summary of the rise of
the ornithological literature from the earliest times to the appear-
ance of Newton's Dictionary of Birds , published in 1896. Then
follows a short account of the evolution of birds with chapters on
adaption, environment, habitat, migration, etc., with a useful
bibliography at the end.
A work of this kind must of necessity be a compilation, and
the difficulty is to separate the grain from the chaff. We should
hardly describe Quail and Vultures as typical desert birds, and
Persia and Afghanistan are not now included in the Indian region.
We are told that the Wrens of St. Kilda and the Shetlands have
longer wings than the mainland birds, because they are exposed
to such strong winds, but no mention is made of the race found
in the Outer Hebrides, an equally wind-swept area, in which the
wings are of the same size as in the mainland race.
Then we would hardly accept the peculiar distribution of two
races of Stonechat in Africa without a revision of all the forms of
Saxicola torquata inhabiting that continent. Holte Macpherson
did not " discover " Fair Isle ; he has never set foot on the island !
There are a number of other minor points which require
checking, but nevertheless the book will certainly be welcomed
by all field naturalists.

The Australian Sheld-duck.
In his account of the first nesting in captivity of the Australian Sheld-duck
(Casarca tadornoides), published in this number, Monsieur Jean Delacour mentions
that a very important point of this bird is that it " proves quite peaceful in a
mixed collection, both with the members of its own species as well as other Ducks
and Geese s '. By a curious coincidence within a day of receiving Monsieur
Delacour's article the Editor also received a letter from Mr. C. L. Sibley, from
Connecticut, dated 13th March, 1939, in which he states : " At the moment
I have a pair of Australian Sheld-ducks (Casarca tadornoides) in Florida which
appear to be on the verge of nesting. The interesting thing to me about them is
that, while they have been almost universally described as the one member
of the Sheld-duck family which is not pugnacious and ill-tempered, this pair of
Australians is exactly, if not more so, as ugly in disposition as any pair of Ruddys,
Paradise, or South Africans. A pair here in the north appears docile and gets on
well with other waterfowl in its pond. Possibly the reason for the mistaken idea
of the Australian's good temper, is that conditions have not been such, where it
has been kept, as to bring it into breeding (and consequently pugnacious)
condition."
It would be extremely interesting to receive further observations on the
behaviour of this bird as those of Monsieur Delacour and Mr. Sibley vary so
much in temperament.

The Lesser Blue-winged Pitta.
In a note on the Lesser Blue-winged Pitta {Pitta cyanoptera) Mr. P. H. Maxwell
states that he regards this species as one of the most charming of aviary birds.
Mr. Maxwell's specimen thrives on chopped raw meat, banana, and insectivorous
food, though, in the wild state, the food consists principally of ants and other
insects and snails. Mr. Maxwell's bird remains for long periods on its perch and
then suddenly gives the most amazing hops and jumps. It seldom makes any
vocal sound, but when it does this consists of an " odd sort of little whispering
sound ". He considers Pittas as more suited to a tropical aviary than to a cage,
as is evidenced by the condition of those in the central aviary at the London Zoo.
The sexes are alike and of colours too many and varied to be described here.

Insurance of Birds Transported by Sea.
The following extract is made from the Annual Report for 1938 of the British
Section, International Committee for Bird Preservation :--
"At the meeting of the International Committee in Rouen in May, 1938,
Dr. van Tienhoven (Netherlands) drew attention to the danger existing in the
possibility of dealers in birds abusing the facilities given by insurance by having
valuable and delicate birds sent to them under very bad conditions. He gave
several illuminating details of large numbers of birds which had died while
being transported, and concluded by proposing that the Chairman of Lloyd's
should be communicated with in order to draw the attention of the Under-
writers to this state of affairs. This proposal was accepted and the President
was charged with sending the letter.
" In June a letter was duly sent by the President, Monsieur Jean Delacour,
to the Chairman of Lloyd's, Mr. S. J. Aubrey, stating that the International
Committee had reliable information that certain animal and bird dealers take

advantage of the facilities given them by insurance to have valuable and delicate
birds sent to them under very bad conditions. In reply a letter was received
in which the Chairman of Lloyd's stated : 'You may be quite sure that the
Underwriters at Lloyd's would be most anxious to put a stop to the malpractices
to which you refer.' Subsequently Mr. Aubrey received a deputation consisting
of the President of the International Committee, Monsieur Jean Delacour,
Mr. Alfred Ezra, Mr. David Seth-Smith, and Miss Phyllis Barclay-Smith, who,
on behalf of the International Committee for Bird Preservation as a whole,
laid the case before him and discussed with him how best it should be dealt with.
Mr. Aubrey expressed full sympathy with the aims of the Committee and his
desire to assist in any way in his power, and undertook that the whole matter
should be investigated. Details of instances in which large numbers of birds
had died while being transported were supplied, and the matter, as promised,
was fully investigated.
" As a result the Committee of Lloyd's offered to print and circulate to Under-
writers the requirements in connection with the insurance of live birds which,
in the opinion of the International Committee, would most effectively achieve
the object in view. With the assistance of the information already collected by the
International Sub-Committee on Bird Transport, conditions which it was felt
should be required for insurance of live birds transported by sea were drawn
up by Monsieur Delacour, Mr. Ezra, Mr. Seth-Smith, and Miss Barclay-Smith,
and submitted to the Committee of Lloyd's.
" On receipt of these proposals a letter was recieved from the Clerk to the
Committee of Lloyd's in which he stated : ' I now have to inform you that arrange-
ments have been made for these suggestions to be brought to the notice of Under-
writers generally, and it is trusted that these will assist in promoting the ends which
your Committee have in view.'
"In this most satisfactory conclusion a most valuable step has been taken
in checking an abuse which is greatly deplored by Zoological Societies, aviculturists
and bird-dealers themselves--a step which will be acclaimed by all bird-lovers.
The International Committee is greatly indebted to the Chairman and Committee
of Lloyd's for their sympathetic co-operation and prompt action."

Each spring when they begin to pour forth their melody the Skylarks of
Victoria, British Columbia, are news. For there is no other place on the American
Continent where they live and breed. Brought to Victoria in 1903 by the British
Columbia Natural History Society and released at the Uplands, a sea girt stretch
of rolling parklike country studded with oak trees, there they have flourished.
They were augmented by forty-nine additional birds in 1913, have bred, and are
now numerically strong, a delight to all who hear them sing. They nest in and
around the Cadboro Bay and Gordon Head districts as well as the Uplands.
In September, 1925, Professor William Lyon Phelps, Dean of American
Literature, wrote to a correspondent in British Columbia : " Victoria, when I saw
it in 1908, seemed to me more English than Warwickshire--it is a lovely spot ;
and probably the English bird knew what he was about when he went there."
This year during Spring Gardens Festival, 3rd-6th May, when hundreds of
garden and beauty lovers from all parts of the country visit Victoria's spring-
time gardens, special arrangements are being made for them to drive out and hear
the Skylark's song.

THE WATERFOWL NUMBER--AN OMISSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.872411125" page_id="56322780"  page_num="172" year="" vol="">
When writing the article on Australian Ducks which appeared in the March
number of the Magazine, I left a blank space where I intended to insert the
dimensions of our enclosures for Waterfowl and another blank space for the number
of Egyptian Geese that our pair have reared during the last four seasons and
intended, at the time, to fill them in when I had the opportunity of checking
up on the actual figures. However, owing to a foolish omission on my part I
posted the article without having filled in the missing data, and the only recourse
left for the Editor was to fill in the blank spaces by saying that " Most of our Ducks
and Geese are accommodated in ' fair-sized 5 yards ", and that " A pair of
Egyptian Geese . . . have reared 5 several ' young during the last four seasons
As this information is somewhat vague I would like to say that the dimensions
of our Waterfowl yards are 50 ft. by 20 ft., and that the number of young reared
by our pair of Egyptian Geese during the last four seasons is twenty-seven.

WHERE ARE THE VERSICOLOR PHEASANTS?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.934179828571429" page_id="56322780"  page_num="172" year="" vol="">
I have read with interest Mr. Hugh Wormald's letter on this subject. In
the first place I personally appreciate the beauty of this Pheasant, although
I consider Mr. Wormald is bold indeed to state its beauty exceeds that of the
Golden and Amherst Pheasants, but I admit it is only a matter of opinion. I
consider the Amherst Pheasant is one of the most beautiful birds in the world,
and running it close is the Mikado Pheasant. There may not have been much
mention in this paper of the Versicolor Pheasant, but I rather imagine there
are more in the country than Mr. Wormald imagines. There is a pair on my
place, Captain Scott Hopkins has a pair, and Mrs. Cawley, of Alnwick, also
possesses a pair, there are also a few other odd pairs about. There are quite
a few reared every year, and I shall be very surprised if a few chicks are not
running about on my lawn before May is out. I think I can give sound reasons
for the drop in their popularity. For many years the average phasianist and
certainly gamekeepers looked upon the Melanistic Mutant (Phasianus tenebrosus)
as the Versicolor ; the former was advertised and bought as the Versicolor.
The result has been that the pure Versicolor has dropped out of favour. Two
years ago I bought two sittings of Versicolor eggs and was assured they were
pure, all the chicks were tenebrosus, much to my disgust. There is a similarity
between the two Pheasants, but on close examination they are entirely dissimilar,
but the fact that both males possess much green plumage is sufficient for many
to label both Versicolors, A year or so ago a judge at one of the patronized
O.P.S. shows labelled a Melanistic as Versicolor ; since he has heard a good
deal about this judgment.
In a recent issue of the O.P.S . Journal a magnificent plate of the Versicolor
Pheasant was portrayed by a Japanese artist, and I must send a copy of this
journal to Mr. Wormald, it may induce him to join that Society ; I hope so.
For his benefit I may state that since the publication of that journal there has
been a steady and gratifying demand for the Pheasant.
As to the hybrid Amherst X Monal, it is certainly a most intriguing cross,
but about ten years ago the late Lady Dunleath reared one in Northern Ireland
(Ballywalter Park to be precise). She kindly sent me a photo of the adult male.
This bird lacked the long beautiful tail of the Amherst cock, but otherwise, judging
from the photo, the Amherst blood was in preponderance.

THE NEED OF A SYSTEM OF PEDIGREES FOR PURE-BRED BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995233956521739" page_id="56322781"  page_num="173" year="" vol="">
Although I have never kept waterfowl owing to not having a suitable place,
I read the March Magazine with great interest and in my own opinion it was one
of the best numbers of the Magazine ever published.
Every article was distinct and there was no overlapping.
In his article Dr. Derscheid mentions certain species of Pheasants, which
it is no longer necessary to import, as it has been found out that they can be
propagated in Europe in the necessary numbers to render their extinction an
impossibility.
One very serious point, however, has cropped up in recent years, not only in
regard to Pheasants, but to many other species of birds. I refer to the hybridisation
of closely related species. Take for instance the Golden and Amherst Pheasants.
It is now almost impossible to get pure specimens.
Having judged Pheasants at about half a dozen shows in 1938, I came to the
conclusion that not one person in a hundred can tell a pure-bred Golden or
Amherst. They may have kept Pheasants twenty years, but how are they to
know a pure one, when they have never seen one ? They may have bought the
birds for pure-bred ones, but the person who sold them was in the same position,
as he did not know the points of a 100 per cent pure bird. Another difficulty
is that show promoters select judges who know nothing about Pheasants, and the
result is that Goldens are judged on size. A Golden cock Pheasant is a small,
light bodied bird with very thin yellow legs, and clear pinkish buff face. The
ones that get the prizes under most non-Pheasant judges are heavy bodied, and
have dark faces, a sure sign of Amherst blood.
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.427972625" page_id="56322781"  page_num="173" year="" vol="">
Even Tragopans, Kaleeges, Hokis and Peacock Pheasants are being crossed.
I have heard remarks at various shows that a similar state of affairs is found in
African Love-Birds.
Unless some system of pedigrees and ringing is adopted it looks as if there
will be very few pure-bred birds twenty years hence.

BREEDING OF WADERS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.733000882352941" page_id="56322781"  page_num="173" year="" vol="">
I am interested in the various letters on Waders, but I fear that Mr. Lambert
is due for disappointment if he hopes to breed any--a few of us in pre-War days
--St. Quin tin, Bonhote, the Zoo and others kept Waders, but as far as I can
remember none but Green Plover, Avocets, Ruffs, and Reeves ever nested,
though I seem to remember that a Knot's egg was laid at Lilford.
I used to keep Curlew, Oyster catchers, Bar- and Black-tailed God wits,
Avocets, Ruffs and Reeves, Redshanks (Common and Dusky), Green, Grey,
Golden, and Ringed Plover, Knots, Turnstones, Dunlins, Curlew Sandpipers,
Whimbrels, Sanderlings, Rednecked Phalaropes, and during the ten years
I had Waders I never got any eggs except from Reeves--in fact we used to be
very pleased if we could persuade the birds to assume full breeding dress.
I entirely agree with Mr. Lambert that Waders are among the most interesting
and nicest birds that one can keep, and I sincerely hope that he will prove me
unduly pessimistic and breed many of them.

WHY ARE MEALWORMS NOT BRED IN ENGLAND?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983874" page_id="56322782"  page_num="174" year="" vol="">
A number of bird lovers who keep insectivorous birds are asking the question,
why do we have to buy imported mealworms, why are they not produced in large
quantities in England as they are in Germany and Holland ? I should also like
to know the reason why. In the event of another world war the supply would
cease and cause a lot of suffering to our birds. It appears to me that a small
limited company could be formed for this purpose, and could be made a paying
proposition. I am certain plenty of bird keepers would subscribe.
The present importers would probably prefer to get their mealworms from a
home supply. Quoting from a letter I have received on the subject from one of
the large importers, he says :
" It is vitally necessary, as I see it, to go and see how it is done, and if such
a person were required, I would volunteer."
I should much like to know what other members of the Avicultural Society
think about the matter.

[I have visited the section of the Aquarium in the Berlin Zoo where meal-
worms, flies, etc., are propagated for the reptiles, amphibians, and fish. The
mealworms are kept in a warmed room on shelves, in wooden, ventilated boxes,
in which are a series of trays. The mealworms in addition to meal are provided
with paper and are in varying degrees of development in order to maintain a
constant supply. I will endeavour to secure exact information of the method
used for publication in the Avicultural Magazine.--Ed.]

(Stephanophorus diadematus)
By H. C. Martin
Of the not very large number of birds which I have kept
and studied in captivity--since as a lad I first began bird-study
and bird-keeping some 50 years ago--this lovely Tanager, by reason
of his many charms, stands out, I think, my favourite. When I
first went out to the River Plate, in 1903, I carried with me, a
valuable contribution to a staff library, the two volumes of W. H.
Hudson's book, Argentine Ornithology , hardly dreaming that I should
really soon make acquaintance with this conspicuously beautiful
species, the subject of one of the fine coloured plates and which,
to my then inexperience, had seemed to me something almost
ethereal, surely altogether too rare, too delicate, ever to be kept in
a cage. But hardly a year later I was making my first journey of any
length in the " camp ", accompanying, by his suggestion, the good
old pastor of the district of Rio Negro in Uruguay, himself a great
nature-lover, on his periodical round amongst his widely-scattered
parishioners. Near the end of our trip we stopped at the Estancia
San Juan and then at the near-by old town of Colonia (that same
San Juan and that same Colonia visited by great Darwin in
1 833 : voyage of the Beagle ), the point of embarkation for Buenos
Aires and the return journey up river.

With eyes open all the time for birds, I still remember vividly,
in particular, how at the Estancia I marvelled at seeing the numer-
ous palomitas , pigeons in miniature, the smallest of the several kinds
of doves so common in the country (at that time at all events),
nesting, perfectly tame and quite unmoved, right under one's eyes
on the rough excrescences and lower branches of some large trees
round the house. But I did not imagine I should be so lucky as to
see the " Cardenal imperial " ( Stephanophorus ) when, a day or so
afterwards in the town, there at the hotel in an open wire cage,
behold a lovely male in all his imperial blue, snow-white cap and
scarlet diadem, tame and in perfect trim, though kept under
conditions which aviculturists at home would judge but little
suited to a Tanager. I seem to remember that when we inquired
" Con que lo alimenta ? " " What do you feed him on ? " part of the
reply was " con flores "--amongst other things--which I can quite
believe, for I do not think the good host was " pulling the leg " of
the " gringos "--because this bird is very fond of green food and loves
to nibble flowering grass and chick-weed, while he simply dotes on
crisp lettuce, preferring it almost to a meal-worm, and he will
gnaw it away with his rather Bullfinch-like beak to the last scrap
of stump. It has not occurred to me to try my present pets with
rose-petals or geraniums, but these could hardly do them harm.
Actually, in the native bird-shops, these birds are fed chiefly
on orange and banana, with sweet potato or scalded maize-meal,
and some finely chopped beef: this latter they eat quite greedily
but, except in small quantities, I do not consider it very good for
them, though it takes the place of insect food when this, a
considerable part of their natural diet, cannot be obtained.
During many years afterwards, at various times, out in pleasant
Uruguay, I kept a few of these birds, purchased in Montevideo,
and I now and then observed them wild in ones and twos near the
river-bank in the neighbourhood of Fray Bentos. The bird is not
common and I never had the good fortune, or good opportunity,
to observe its nesting and other habits in freedom. Hence I cannot
personally say anything scientific about these, but I am able to
quote some passages from a recent article in an excellent, authori-
tative Argentine periodical, La Chacra (The Farm), devoted to
farming, agriculture and country topics, which I believe will
interest aviculturists. This article translated reads :--

" We illustrate as our frontispiece a male example of the
Cardenal Azul (Blue Cardinal), a beautiful bird of the River
Plate which makes its appearance in Spring, migrating to warmer
climes as winter approaches and fruits, its principal food, become
scarce : it is a creature which, though it bears cold well, only
lives comfortably in a warm climate." (My experience does not
quite bear this out since, with proper shelter, it winters admirably
in England as I shall show further on, while I have a distinct
recollection of watching a couple picking about on my garden
path in Fray Bentos one very cold day indeed).
" It is also known by the name of Cardenal Imperial or Cardenal
de la Sierra , and in Uruguay it is called Cardenal Patria because
it bears the colours of the flag of Artigas (the Liberator and
national hero).
" Every year it appears first in Uruguay, coming from Brazil,
and then passes to the islands and river-banks of the Rio de la
Plata, where it is seen singly or in pairs : these birds do not go
in flocks and are not abundant, it being difficult to get them in
the birdshops of the capital, because the catchers can rarely
obtain them in number sufficient to meet the demand.
" It nests in the woods, in high trees, principally fruit-bearers,
where it makes a shallow nest, lined with dry grass. The
female lays, as a rule, four white eggs with flecks of deep red.
" During incubation the male remains hidden in the densest
foliage, continuously singing to his mate. His song consists of
a soft melody but does not give him fame as a song-bird, since
it is rather for the adornment of their aviaries by reason of
his strikingly beautiful plumage alone that amateurs acquire
him.
tc They live very well in captivity and there have been persons
who have succeeded in breeding them. The birds are some 17
to 19 centimetres long. They eat grains and insects but their
favourite food is fruit, principally the orange, of which they leave
only the skin and the membranous divisions of the core and
segments.
" They get tame very soon after being caged, to the point
of coming to feed from the hand of the person who tends them.
They do no damage in the fruit-gardens, despite the fact that
they are fruit-eaters, possibly because they are not common

enough to be looked upon as harmful." (How unfortunate that
this is too often the case with our own lovely Bullfinch, which
they somewhat parallel).
It is true that they eat out an orange in the way described but
it is another, much more abundant Tanager, the light blue come-
higos, or " fig-eater ", helped too by the lovely siete colores , as the
little boys call him--the Seven-coloured, or Striated Tanager,
often associating with it--that does serious damage at times to the
oranges and figs, and is unhappily mercilessly shot in consequence.
It is curious to discover sometimes that what one took for a full,
ripe orange still hanging on the tree is just a shell completely
hollowed out from above by these birds.
Returning from the Plate in 1926, and thinking that I would
remain in England, though I had not yet decided on establishing
a home here, I could not resist bringing over two male White-caps
to keep wherever and whenever I could make them comfortable.
Fate, however, decided that I should go back once more to the
sunny South and thus, instead, I had the pleasure of presenting
them to the Zoo, where only last month, over twelve years later,
I saw one of them still in excellent condition, though showing signs
of age, while the other survived till only a few months previously,
no bad record for small birds in captivity and proof of their
adaptability to cage life--and of the great care with which they
have been looked after.
By a coincidence, just at the time that I learned of the death
of the latter bird, I received two more nice males and, having
another old favourite too in my small collection, I was happy to
offer one of these also to the Zoo, so that there are still in the Bird
House two males of these interesting birds in the large box cage
which has so long been devoted to them.
I had been long trying to get some females when, early in 1936,
a friend rather unexpectedly brought me over three, but owing to a
change of residence, I was only able to accommodate one, parting
with a second to another aviculturist and sending the third to the
Zoo. Unfortunately, misfortune overtook both of these not very
long afterwards, while the one I retained proved weakly and lived
some ten months or so only, so that my hopes of breeding this bird
were shattered pro tern., but at least I had the pleasure of observing

the elegant display and quaint approaches of the male towards his
mate, raising one foot at a time, as if it were a hand, to touch her.
Since the female is so seldom brought over I might say that her
plumage is of a dull, almost slaty blue throughout and, but for a few
hardly visible flecks, she completely lacks the snow-white cap of
the adult male, while her frontal tuft is of a coppery hue instead of a
rich red. In the old male the cap is of a pure glistening white and,
when fully depressed, with the tuft or diadem which fronts it, forms
a clearly defined " V " shape pointing down the neck, the tuft
making a similar but narrower pattern along its middle. In the
young male--I have by my side as I write a nice one, two years old
perhaps, sharing a large cage with a Scarlet Tanager--the white
cap is rather indistinct and blends into the blue of the neck feathers,
nor has the rest of his plumage, though handsome, yet reached the
full imperial blue of the adult.
My old bird lives now, with some small South Americans, in
an outdoor aviary where he has been throughout this past, really
severe winter, but of course it is furnished with an inside shelter,
in which the lowest temperature I have observed has been about
43 0 . Yet he is in splendid health and feather and it is delightful,
when one goes out to attend to the food supply, to see this beautiful
gleam of blue come sailing down to discover what one has brought
him, for these birds, like others of the Tanagers, are very confiding
and intelligent. I have at the corner of the aviary what I call a little
" feeding table " accessible by a small self-closing door, an arrange-
ment which avoids one entering the aviary each time and which I
can much recommend. At really cold times I shut him and his
companions in the inner compartment by means of a sliding
shutter, worked by a counterpoise, and, incidentally, it is amusing
to see, when a mild day comes, how eagerly they all troop out the
moment the slide is lowered, if but a bare two inches.
Although this bird lives very happily when kept indoors at a
mild and even temperature, as at the Zoo, this is, as I have shown,
by no means a necessity for he is really quite hardy and will do
excellently under roomy, and as sunny as possible, out-of-doors
conditions, provided that he has been long enough in England to
have adapted his moulting period to our seasons, and that dry,
draughtless and frost-proof shelter be at his disposal. It is to my
mind a cruelty to expose birds from warm countries to the cold of

our winter, but this particular Tanager is not really " tropical ",
and in fact the climate in the River Plate can be at times extremely
chilly. My small aviary is built against the house wall--there is
to my mind nothing like a lean-to--from which it receives some
warmth and when the weather is frosty a small electric stove in the
adjoining shed helps to keep things comfortable.
I kept this old bird for some two years at first under ordinary
sitting-room conditions and he has never been sick or sorry except
for one occasion when he developed a cyst on the cheek which
seemed to threaten the eye. Although I greatly dislike to handle
birds I was thus forced to catch him, roll him in a handkerchief
and gently excise it, using a diluted antiseptic ; after a week or
two no trace of the trouble remained and his plumage soon became
perfect again.
I am more enthusiastic than La Chacra as to this Tanager's
powers as a vocalist ; for me he is one of the most agreeable bird
musicians I know, his song being sweet and sustained and inter-
spersed with some quaint and delightful chattering notes. When
my older male was kept indoors he sang constantly, both by day
and by artificial light--at one's bidding even, and, delighting in
the rustling of a newspaper and the sound of voices or the wireless he
would sing so vigorously in fact that we sometimes had, jokingly,
to tell him to be quiet, as the combined noises were rather over-
powering.
His junior too, here as I write, is chattering and warbling very
prettily, but he has not yet attained the full power of song of the
adult.
The feeding of these birds gives no special trouble : fruit is the
natural staple--orange, banana, grapes, sweet apple or pear--in
good-sized portions which I fix in a hook-on pan in such a way that
they cannot pull them out, and at the same time always some food
of a farinaceous kind, namely ordinary rice or semolina pudding from
the table, chopped egg with dry crushed sweet biscuit, crumbled
cake and so forth. As stated, they are very fond of lettuce and other
green food and rejoice in a ripe cherry or privet berries in season,
while they will also eat apple pips and certain seeds. They should
have a few meal-worms daily or a scrap of shredded beef or,
better still, spiders, small moths, beetles and flies which are
part of their diet in the wild, and which one tries to procure for

them as far as possible in the summer. Saw-dust I consider better
than sand for their cage-floors and I doubt in fact whether grit of
any kind is necessary for these soft feeders, though I provide sand
as well, "por las dudas ."
I have sometimes wondered what fruits these and other Tanagers
lived on in the River Plate before the Spanish colonists introduced
the prolific vine, orange, fig, loquat and other European kinds.
As far as my knowledge goes the monte , i.e. the woods, seem
to be singularly lacking in palatable wild fruits such as we have in
England, though there is one tree at least, called higueron, which
bears quantities of little, rather tasteless " figs " doubtless attracting
many birds.
Like all the Tanagers, White-caps are most energetic bathers
and delight in soaking themselves till they can barely fly. My old
bird promptly makes for the water-pan in the outer flight when he is
let out on what the weather clerk calls " rather milder " days and
thoroughly enjoys a good splash in spite of the, actually, quite
chilly conditions.
I have not seen these birds offered for a very long time : they
are not easy to get, partly on account of their scarcity and partly
---I am glad to record from what friends overseas have written to
me--because of the stricter enforcement nowadays of the close
season laws. South American republics too, it would seem, are
realizing the importance of protecting their fauna, and particularly
the birds. Then, too, it is difficult to get them properly cared for
on board ship and the trials of the voyage may often result in
permanent sickliness. At all events the aviculturist who possesses
one, or several, is fortunate, for altogether I know no small bird
having more pleasing attributes combined with great beauty, or
one more desirable as a pet either in a suitable covered cage indoors
or flying free in a not over-large aviary.

BREEDING RARE PARRAKEETS IN THE
CHICAGO ZOOLOGICAL PARK AT
BROOKFIELD, ILLINOIS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9855522" page_id="56322800"  page_num="182" year="" vol="">
By Karl Plath, Curator of Birds
This is to be narrative, rather lengthy I am afraid, of a breeding
experiment and its results amongst birds, rarely if ever before,
propagated in American Zoological Gardens. The main inspira-
tion of this idea was the magnificent collection of birds brought to
the Chicago Zoological Park at Brookfield from Australia in
May, 1934. This was secured from the Taronga Zoological Park
Trust of which Colonel Alfred Spain is the Chairman, and came
under the personal supervision of Charles Camp, overseer. The
excellent care shown the birds during their long journey was
very evident on their arrival--every one was in perfect show
condition and possibly only a zoo man or a sincere lover of animals
could really appreciate what this signified. It meant unending
and faithful care every minute of the trip.
Mr. Edward H. Bean, the Director of the Brookfield Zoo, has
had many successful results in breeding in the various depart-
ments and among those yet to be attempted was a plan to breed
from the choice stock of the Parrakeets which formed an important
part of this Australian collection. The plan finally materialized
in the spring of 1938, when a row of breeding runs was built in a
secluded part of the service yard away from the din and clamour
of the public. It seemed pretentious to us at the beginning, but
now that success seems assured, we could use again as many.
The runs measure 6 feet across by 20 feet long and 7 feet high, and
have an open shelter at the north end. The nest-box, which may
be compared to a grandfather's clock in style, stands out in the
open at the opposite end from the shelter and the roof above it is
covered with burlap which admits rain, but protects from the sun's
rays. The nest-box reaches nearly to the top and has an opening
commensurate with the size of the birds. Below the opening is a
small " porch ". The box is filled about three-quarters full of
earth and peat-moss with a piece of inverted sod on top. Rough
bark was nailed on the inside, aiding the birds to climb up or down.
Lord Tavistock, whom we know as one of England's most successful
Parrot breeders, was most gracious in giving us these valuable

" tips ", and it speaks well for this type of nesting-box to mention
that nine species of the Parrot tribe immediately " took " to it.
A record of accomplishment in breeding birds in captivity
means more than the mere laying of an egg or even hatching it.
It means that the youngster must reach an age where it can fly
and feed itself without the aid of its parents. Concerning Parrots
if a young bird is seen outside the nest for the first time it may be
said to be a fact accomplished. If they are willing to breed they
go about their business in their own determined way and usually
the female is seldom seen during incubation. After the young
have hatched both parents feed them in the privacy of the nesting
cavity and we do not see the results of our hopes until they appear
one by one ready for their battles with the world. Sometimes,
of course, tragedy ensues--the female may die egg-bound, eggs may
be infertile or the young may die from lack of attention--but we
found these dismal happenings to be the exception.
Most of the pairs selected were put in the runs on 5th June, and
they will be named in order of success.
Our hopes at first centred on the Bourke's and Turquoisines
as they showed immediate interest, and it was not long before the
females of each disappeared. The males, however, seemed to find
the nest-holes companionable and spent long hours alongside
warbling in a quiet, contented manner. We had placed a hollow
log in the Bourke's cage ; it was the only one used because of the
difficulty in getting suitable ones. The female remained in seclusion
until nth July, when she appeared for a short time, then again
retired until 2nd August. On that date the first youngster appeared
--almost identical with its mother in appearance, and three days
later a second one emerged. Shortly afterwards it disappeared,
and there was no trace to be found of it. In the meantime the
female again took to the nest while the male attended to the wants
of his remaining offspring. One morning a tell-tale bunch of
feathers showed there had been a struggle of some sort, but again
no trace of the young bird. Later, both mice and a shrew were
caught, and it is possible that the young birds either stunned or
killed themselves flying about and, dropping down, were seized
and carried away by these vicious marauders.
However, we have a cheerful sequel to record with the pair of
Bourke's. By the end of October there were several intermittent

<bodyText confidence="0.999371846153846" page_id="56322802"  page_num="184" year="" vol="">
days of abominable weather, so it was decided to catch up the pair.
To our surprise and delight, a youngster had made its appearance
and was flying about. This made it urgent to remove birds and
nesting-log to a smaller cage at once, so there would be no risk of
the young birds hurting themselves in their wild flight. A quick
scrutiny revealed three more young birds inside the log, and the
next day all four were out and quietly inspecting their surroundings.
The Turquoisine procedure was much the same as that of the
Bourke's, with the exception that but one young bird appeared,
and was seen only for a few hours on the day of its appearance.
The mice had gained access and had several holes under the founda-
tion in which we later found some of the bodies of the " victims ".
It is my belief that all the deaths were caused by the fright incurred
by stray cats and squirrels scrambling over the tops of the runs.
We will dismiss the experiment with the Turquoisines in this short
paragraph--it was a keen disappointment not to have had success
with them, but it is hoped they will live long enough so that we
may try again this year.
The Cockatiel were the next to show results, for on 5th August,
twenty days after we first heard voices in the nest, a fine young bird
appeared, and three days later, another. Both parents incubated
alternately--the male bird being on the nest during the day.
Shortly after the second young bird emerged the female again went
to nest, and after another long period a third appeared on 28th
September. We had to see what had gone on in the nest, and
inspection revealed the dried body of a callow infant. Cockatiel,
of course, are not considered difficult, and breeding them would
not be thought extraordinary.
Probably the greatest cause for joy came with the Queen
Alexandra Parrakeets. Robert Bean, Assistant Director, was
fortunate enough to secure the last of three pairs which were the
first ever to come to America. They arrived on 14th July, in their
original shipping cage, which had housed them for many weeks.
This species is very elegant in form, and in its delicate pastel tints
of green and pink forms a refined contrast to the garish colour
schemes of most of the Parrot tribe. The pair was installed in one
of the runs, and within two weeks we were fairly certain that they
approved of the nesting site. The female was seen less and less
frequently, and finally in September, after seeing the male fly

into the nest, we suddenly heard the welcome sounds of young
birds being fed. They were much noisier than any of the other
babies we had been hearing, and we could hear them every day
until the first appeared twenty-six days later on 2nd October. It
was so like the parents we could not be sure until we saw three
birds feeding together. On the next day the second youngster
was noticed sitting in the nesting hole. It differed from the others
in having the forehead pink like the throat, instead of pale grey.
The season becoming too late to risk further breeding it was deemed
best to close up the nesting-hole, but before doing so an examination
disclosed the female with four more eggs. A discarded nest-box
was hastily sawed in half and prepared to hold its quota of earth ;
it was then replaced on the lower half and put in the run alongside
the occupied nest. Some handles had been fastened on so it could
be moved whenever necessary with a minimum of shaking up.
The female and the eggs were carefully put in the new nest, and
she continued her incubation without a sign of impatience for
many days. A sudden cold snap came on 23rd October, and forced
us to take the family and the nest indoors to the exhibition cages.
A newly-hatched " chick " was peering from under its mother's
wing, so to avoid any chance of neglect on the part of the parents
and the first-born already being able to feed themselves--we
removed them to another cage. We await further developments
from the second brood. This is the first record for America.
The gorgeous King Parrots have always been our favourites--
the male especially, in vermilion and rich green, being outstanding
in brilliancy. From the time of their arrival they were not happy
in the wall-cages, and several were lost until they were removed
to a large flight cage in the Perching Bird House, which they
shared with a miscellaneous group ranging from Oyster-catchers
to Bower-birds. Frequently the female was seen feeding on the
raw meat which had been put there for the Kookaburras. She paid
no attention to the various hollow logs placed for her disposal
beyond a quick and indifferent investigation. But when released in
the breeding run outdoors they showed immediate interest, and
in due time presented us with two very husky progeny. They
remained in the nest twenty-five and twenty-six days after we
first heard their voices demanding food. There was a second
brood of two which were still in the pin-feather stage when found

dead and desiccated, having been deserted by the mother. We
noticed that the male did most of the feeding in this family. The
young birds are like the female, but lack the pale green feathers
which mark the wings in both sexes.
The gay Crimson-winged Parrakeets were in rough plumage
when they were put out, and it was some time before they showed
any inclination even to inspect the nest. Finally, by the ist July,
it was evident that the female had eggs in the nest, for she was not
were audible, but it was not until forty-six days later that the first
young bird came out. It could fly like a veteran, but had the toes
missing on one foot--whether this was a defect from birth or the
result of an attack is difficult to say, as there was no sign of recent
injury. A second bird came out four days later ; it was smaller
than the first, but both resembled the mother. It may take a year
or more before we are certain of the sexes. These are among
the most gorgeous of the family ; the combination of scarlet, green,
and velvety black being dazzling in the sunlight.
Our Swainson's Lorikeets were the surprise of the lot. Apparently
always ignoring the nest-box they were to be seen every time we
visited the runs. In fact, when Robert Bean brought in a fine
pair of Barraband's on 5th August, we decided to remove them
and give the run to the newcomers. The Swainson's were caught
up and put in a small box while we proceeded to renovate the
nest. When the top was taken off our plans were suddenly changed,
for there were two downy young huddled in the hollow. When
the incubation took place we do not know, but it is likely that
whenever we appeared on the scene the male would in some way
warn his spouse and she would immediately dash out to be on the
spot.
Needless to say we left them in peace. Exactly fifty-two days
later the first young bird left the nest, and the second came forth
five days later. They^ were almost identical in colour with the
parents--just a trifle duller and faint bars marked the paler orange
breast. There were many days when we heard no sound at all from
the nest before the young were seen, and we often were in doubt
as to their being still alive.
This happy result gave us further ambition. In our regular
outdoor exhibition cage we had nine more Swainson's. One had

laid an egg on the ground, so for encouragement we placed an old
artificial woodpecker's log in a recess in the wall. It was immedately
taken over by a pair--the male of which was most woe-begone in
appearance and particularly bedraggled in his neck plumage.
It was not until the 3rd September that we first heard sounds
of young birds, and they were most vociferous. They could be
heard every day until the 14th October, when we first saw a young
bird on the ground. It was not long before the other adults in the
cage took a too-active dislike to the stranger, and we were fortunate
in getting it out before any dire happening. For safety's sake the
nest log and all was taken over to one of the runs. When the log
was lifted from its recess another young bird flew from a hole which
had been chewed out in the rear, and there was a third baby in
the nest. A sudden drop in temperature to 36* reminded us that
our abnormally warm fall was to come to an end, so that family
was brought in for the winter. In the hour's interval before the
birds were caught up a young rat got one, and two days later
another was killed by one of the adults. So our total of young
Swainson's to date numbers three, but all are doing very well.
The young birds from the second pair did not appear as well
feathered as the first lot on leaving the nest ; it will be interesting
to note the development of the last young bird whose parents lived
under conditions quite different from the first pair which had the
advantage of a long grassy flight.
There were pairs of other species which did very little or
nothing--at any rate no young were reared. An unfortunate finish
to our attempt with the Red-sided Eclectus came after weeks of
hopeful watching. We were not over-concerned when we did not
see the female for a long period, because we thought she was
incubating eggs. Finally our curiosity forced us to look in the nest,
only to find her a dead and dried corpse, possibly from egg-binding.
The Black Lories deceived us with their apparent earnestness,
but time proved that they only used the box for sleeping. The
Rosellas laid four eggs and the female incubated faithfully for too
long a period when she must have realized the futility of her sacrifice.
The eggs were clear. The Barraband's arrived too late for safe
breeding, but showed no interest anyway. Perhaps the ubiquitous
Budgerigar should not be mentioned in this company of blue-
bloods, but nevertheless from three pairs--green, yellow, and blue--

we derived fifteen young in a wide and bewildering range of
colours--three shades of green, yellow, grey, pale-blue, and white.
This test has proved that Chicago 5 s summer climate appears as
conducive as any for successful breeding, and it seems remarkable
that birds should be willing to propagate their kind after four years
of being on exhibition in cages which certainly gave them no
chance for retirement. These results have been most encouraging,
and stimulate further efforts in the future. The field is vast, and
fortunately available subjects are numerous and varied.

BREEDING EXPERIMENTS WITH HOODED
PARRAKEETS

At the end of 1935 I obtained a pair of Hooded Parrakeets
which had already laid and brooded while in the possession of their
former owner, but had reared no young. With me they also
brooded without any result, but their behaviour was so interesting
that it is worth while describing.
In the winter 1935-6 I placed the Hoodeds in a cage in my
living room where they were allowed to fly about free for many
hours each day. They were hostile towards the other Parrots
in the room and they ruled the lot as they were very pugnacious.
They had respect only for a tame Parrotlet which in a battle
used to fly furiously on to their shoulders and so make them helpless.
To sleep they either sat on one of the nest-boxes which were hanging
in the cage, or, if the cage was open, on a shelf above one of the
doors. Here they sat breast to breast close together and did not
stir the whole night even when other birds were alarmed and
fluttered about as, is well known, frequently happens with
Australian Parrakeets. Not unless a bird flew directly on to them
would they likewise start up in fright and fly off. Their need of
sleep was very great ; they went to rest much earlier than their
relations and also woke up much later. They did no harm to the

carpets or furniture though they soon began to peck holes in the
wall just above the carpet on the part which was covered with
lime-colour. This was undoubtedly with the praiseworthy intention
of making a nesting-hole. Later on this intention was fulfilled
as I will fully describe below. During this winter, however, it was
merely a playful occupation.
In freedom, the Hoodeds, as is already well known, breed in
ant-hills, in which they dig out a nest-hole with beak and feet.
In the garden aviary, in which I placed the pair at the end of
April, 1936, I had arranged a mound made of clay with some sand
and chalk of about the size of an upright sack of potatoes. In this
I made some transverse furrows and little holes of about the size
of a thimble. Sure enough, a week after being put in the aviary
the birds, cock as well as hen, began to peck at these holes. When
I covered all but one with clay they remained at this one and
together deepened it with such industry that after about five
weeks they could get right into and turn round in it. In the middle
of June, when the hole was nearly ready, the moult began, as
unfortunately generally happens with these birds, and the breeding
impulse was past. Not till the middle of September did it arise
anew and then the birds soon went again in the hole. As the
season of the year was so advanced there could be no more hope
of results, so I stopped up the hole and put the pair back again in
my room where they were at once at home, but showed no signs
of breeding.
On 2nd April, 1937, I put the Hoodeds, which had begun to
moult in January and February, back in their garden aviary.
Not till September, after the moult was finally ended, did they
again develop the breeding impulse. This time they showed little
interest in the clay mound ; they only occasionally crept into it
and the female spent a great deal of time pecking a hole in a beam.
When I affixed a nesting-box, made out of a natural tree trunk,
the female immediately entered it. On 12th September I brought
the pair back again to my room where they began at once to peck
a number of holes in the wall. I deepened one of these and put a
perch underneath it. This was adopted by the birds and assiduously
worked further. A row of bricks in the wall, which was otherwise
entirely composed of plaster, I dug out myself, but the rest was
removed by the Hoodeds alone. At first they pecked out pieces

of plaster with their bills and then let them fall to the ground, but
when they could creep half-way into the hole they kicked the
loosened plaster out backwards with their feet so that the pieces
flew far out into the room. Both male and female worked about
the same amount. The passage was so large that the birds could
creep through it. Even after a few days the tunnel was excavated
so far that the next room was reached. The comparatively thin
wall offering no possibility for nest building, as in the clay mounds,
I hung a nesting-box in front of the hole. I had removed one side
from this box so that the Hoodeds could enter it direct from their
tunnel. They were perfectly content with this arrangement and as
soon as 30th September, that is to say only eighteen days after they
had reached the room, the first egg lay in the box, and up to
6th October, three further eggs followed ; they weighed 5-6 gr.
and measured 21-22 X 19 mm. The female brooded perfectly,
but unfortunately three of the eggs were infertile, despite the fact
that I had seen several successful pairings taking place. The fourth
egg soon expired. A second clutch did not follow although the
birds still occasionally went in the hole or into one of the nesting-
boxes hanging in the room.
In 1938 I put the Hoodeds, which again had begun to moult
in the winter, in the garden on 20th June when the moult was
nearly finished. This time they had another, larger aviary about
6 metres long in which was also a mound of clay. However, they
did not take any notice whatever of this. When the birds developed
the breeding impulse, which also on this occasion did not occur
till September, they tried to bite holes in one of the solid walls
of the aviary. A nesting-box, which I hungup on 18th September,
was at once investigated and both birds crept in and out of it.
From the 4th to nth October the female laid four eggs which
measured 21-22 X 19 mm. This time three eggs were fertile, but
the young died in the shell. On 7th November after the female
had sat closely for about four weeks I transferred the birds to
the winter room. This year also they did not produce a second
clutch. Naturally I shall continue my experiments in 1939 and
hope eventually to be able to report complete results.

Volume III of the New Series, which commenced in November?
1904, contains eight coloured plates, as well as several black and
white plates and text illustrations.
The first plate is a very beautiful one by Goodchild, showing
the European and Himalayan Goldfinches. Bonhote writes on the
former, which was even then increasing in numbers in this country
as a result of protection. The Himalayan species ( Carduelis caniceps)
is dealt with by Frank Finn. The two species are much alike, but
there is no doubt that our bird is by far the more handsome of
the two.
Mrs. Johnstone contributes an article on the breeding of
Fraser's or the Great-billed Touraco ( Turacus macrorhynchus ),
which stands out as an event of particular importance in the
annals of aviculture, for up to that time the nestling was apparently
unknown. It was not reared, owing no doubt to the lateness of
the season (September), but it formed the subject of an important
article by W. P. Pycraft, who was able to compare the relationship
of this group with the Cuckoos and the Hoatzin. St. Quintin writes
an interesting article on the nesting of Pterocles exustus, the Fesser
Pintailed Sandgrouse, with which he was very successful. He
mentions a curious habit these birds have of supplying moisture to
their young, and remarks :
" Mr. Meade-Waldo was the first to describe this most interesting
habit in the case of the former species [P. alchatus, the Greater
Pintailed Sandgrouse]. It has been repeatedly observed in my
aviaries, and now again with exustus. Whether the habit is common
to all the species of this family remains to be ascertained, though
in the case of the five arenarius Mr. Meade-Waldo observed this
species also visiting the troughs and puddles about the village wells
in Morocco, and flying off after soaking their breast-plumage,
doubtless with the same object in view. The process is so extra-
ordinary that perhaps I may be forgiven for again dwelling upon it.

The young no doubt are somehow able to make it clear to their
male parent that they wish to drink and he starts off to the pan,
and after sipping a little on his own account, steps in and stands
motionless for a minute or two, watching. Then he sits down in the
water, and goes through a shuffling movement, very like a bird
that is dusting. After remaining in the water several minutes, he
gets out and hurries off, loudly calling to the young who, if old
enough, run to meet him. Then follows what reminds one more
than anything of a mammal suckling its young : the chicks push
their heads amongst the breast-plumage and under tail-coverts,
evidently taking the water off the feathers by passing them through
their bills, moving to fresh places as the supply becomes exhausted."
This habit has been discounted by certain ornithologists, who
have done more collecting than observing, as a habit acquired as
the result of captivity, but birds do not alter their habits to this
extent in one or in very many generations.
A coloured plate of the White-fronted Dove (Leptoptila jamaicensis)
shows this beautiful bird in the act of cooing. These Doves were at
one time frequently imported, but I fear they have now become
quite rare in Jamaica, as a result of the ill-considered introduction
into that island of the mongoose, which, after doing some good in
destroying rats, set to work to destroy the very interesting Ground
Doves.
Reference is made to an account, published in the Bulletin de la
Societe National d'Acclimatation de France , of tame Swallows, by
M. G. Pays-Mallier, who considers these the most intelligent,
amusing, and interesting of all insectivorous birds. He made a
practice every year of rearing some of the early broods from the
nest, but allowed them complete liberty. During the summer
months these tame birds might be seen flying at great heights, but
always coming to a call and perching upon his finger without the
slightest fear of any number of strangers present. He always carried
a few mealworms to reward them for their trustfulness, and they
remained tame until the time for their departure when they left
with their wild companions.
A very fine coloured plate by Goodchild depicts a pair of
Peter's Spotted Firefinches ( Lagonosticta niveiguttata) , a living speci-
men, the first apparently to be seen in this country, having been
exhibited at the Crystal Palace in February, 1903.

In writing on the Smew in captivity, Bonhote refers to the
existence of a society which was known as the " Ornithological
Society of London ", founded in 1873 with the object of keeping
rare and foreign birds, more especially water birds, in confinement.
Among its 200 members were the late Mr. Yarrell and Lord Lilford,
and one of its privileges was the use of the waters of the Royal
Parks for Waterfowl. This was probably the commencement of the
interesting collection of these birds that has been maintained in
St. James's Park to the present day.
Miss R. Alderson, who was an authority on the keeping and
breeding of foreign Doves, gives an interesting account of the
successful breeding of the Solitary Ground Dove, otherwise known
as the Bronze-necked or Salvadori's Dove (.Leptoptila chloroauchenia ).
A young bird was successfully reared in the early summer, but
later nests were unsuccessful. " Late hatched birds," writes
Miss Alderson, " never do well and the parents seldom look after
them so thoroughly as in the case of the earlier broods."
Mrs. Johnstone writes on the Black Lory (Chalcopsittacus ater),
which is illustrated by an excellent black and white drawing, by
Gronvold. Mrs. Johnstone had received an example, collected by
Walter Goodfellow in N.W. New Guinea, which was the first
living specimen to be brought to this country, though a good many
have arrived since.
Hubert Astley always wrote in a very charming way, and his
account of his outdoor aviary on the Italian Riviera gives one a
glimpse of palm trees and orange groves, with the deep blue of the
sky and sea. An ideal site for an outdoor aviary, and one is not
surprised to read that many young birds were reared. Senegal and
Diamond Doves increased so greatly that the experiment was tried
of liberating them in the garden. One can quite realize that " a
pair of Diamond Doves in perfect condition, sitting cooing and
preening their feathers in an orange tree, with the golden fruit
hanging over their small grey heads, and the brilliant blue of the
Mediterranean in the background, is worth seeing ". And we can
picture his delight in watching a cock Diamond Dove cooing in an
orange tree on a level with his face as he stood on an upper terrace
" when suddenly he shot out and went soaring up and away over
the sea, coming down again with outstretched wings, rather after
the manner of a Wood Pigeon ". One must know this delightful

white spots, as well as its arrow-like flight, to appreciate the joy
of such a scene.
A coloured plate of the Yellow-rumped Munia (Munia flavi-
prymna) was drawn from one of the first specimens of this species
to reach Europe. Although the species was described by Gould in
1845, it remained almost unknown until the arrival of a single
living example, sent to me by Mr. H. E. Pier, of Sydney, in 1904,
the only specimen in the British Museum being one collected in
1856. Astley writes on Bourke's Parrakeet, a coloured drawing of
which he has himself supplied, and also of that other lovely Parrakeet,
Polytelis (or Spathopterus) alexandrae , the Queen Alexandra's or
Princess of Wales' Parrakeet.
A. Trevor-Battye contributes a delightful article on Hey's
Partridge (.Ammoperdix heyi), which is illustrated by a charming
drawing from his own brush, for he was a practised artist as well
as a gifted writer. When in the Cairo Zoological Gardens in the
spring of 1904, he was much struck with the elegance of these little
Partridges and, through the kindness of Captain (now Major)
S. S. Flower, the Director, was able to bring home a pair from which
he subsequently reared some young. It is a lovely little Partridge,
mostly of a reddish fawn colour, which inhabits the rocky desert
country on both sides of the Red Sea, and is sometimes known
as the Sand or See-see Partridge. Very few have been imported
into this country, though it is not difficult to keep in a sunny and
dry aviary with good shelter.
An account is given of the fourth International Ornithological
Congress, which opened in London on 12th June, 1905, under the
presidency of Dr. Bowdler Sharpe. It was very similar to those that
have followed it, but it is interesting to look back at the names of
the ornithologists who took part, some of which are with us to-day,
though others have gone. That was, I believe, the first Congress
at which there was a section on Aviculture, but only one paper was
read, and that by myself, on *&amp;apos; The Importance of Aviculture as
an aid to the study of Ornithology ". Excursions were made to
Woburn, Tring, Cambridge (where Professor Newton informed the
members that they had come to the place where the nest was made
and the egg laid which hatched into the Ibis ), to Mr. Bonhote's
aviaries at Fen Ditton, and finally to the breeding site of

innumerable sea-birds on Flamborough Head and Bempton in
Yorkshire.
Articles by myself on the breeding of Turnix varia, the Australian
Varied Bustard Quail and the Australian Swamp Quail ( Syncecus
australis) bring back happy memories. The former proved of
especial interest, as its habits were the same as those of Turnix tanki
of India, which I had previously kept and bred. In this species the
female is much larger and more brightly coloured than the male,
who performs the duties of incubation and the rearing of the young,
a process I was able to watch.
Butler writes on the breeding of hybrids between the Grey-
winged Ouzel ( Merula boulboul) and English Blackbird ;
T. H. Newman supplies an account of birds seen on a trip in the
Mediterranean, and Major F. W. Proctor remarks upon the abun-
dance of breeding Redpolls in Berkshire in 1905.
A very good coloured plate of the Golden-throated Barbet
[Cyanops franklini) , by Gronvold, is accompanied by an article on
this species by Reginald Phillipps, while an equally successful
coloured drawing of the Red-capped Parrot ( Pionopsittacus pileatus)
by Goodchild is followed by an article by Hubert Astley.
Concluding articles in this volume deal with the breeding of
Gray's Bare-throated Francolin ( Pternistes leucoscepus) by Sir William
Ingram, Bart., illustrated by Collingham Ingram, who follows with
an article on the Little Auk in Spitzbergen. The Rev. G. D. Farrar
writes on the successful nesting of the White-throated Finch
(Spermophila albigularis) and Captain Perreau contributes a delightful

ON BULBULS
By Godfrey Davis

<bodyText confidence="0.999285657142857" page_id="56322814"  page_num="196" year="" vol="">
In the garden at Larkana, Upper Sind, there were many
Bulbuls as well as Parrakeets. They are white-cheeked Bulbuls
with black crests and saffron yellow under their tails, not
a pale yellow but a good rich saffron, and early in the
morning they sun themselves upon the tops of the tamarisk or Lai
trees, for it is chilly at nights and in the early mornings. They
have the same cheery notes as have their cousins farther south,
the Red-vented and the Red-whiskered, but not quite so loud and
clear, because the White-cheeked Bulbul, though he has the same
bright and busy ways, is more subdued in his calls and in his
deportment and in his feathers too.
In the Deccan it is not usual for little boys to catch full-grown
Bulbuls. They take them from the nest and rear them, but here in
Sind little boys do catch full-grown Bulbuls and tame them in a
few days. The way to tame them is to keep them hungry and then
to feed them on boiled yams or sweet potatoes or what are called
here Lahori Gajar or Carrots from Lahore ! These are sweet and
when boiled and skinned make a very good diet for the local
Bulbuls ; and they will fight on it and for it too, because Bulbuls
are kept here mainly for fighting. But the fighting is not very serious
and no one is really hurt, but as with the tame Partridges, it is
believed if Bulbuls do not fight occasionally they lose interest in
life.
On the Bombay side Bulbuls, the Red-vented and the Red-
whiskered, are taken from the nest and reared by hand. Undoubtedly
grasshoppers are the ideal food for rearing, not the hard-cased
grasshoppers found in stony places ; these are indigestible, but
the long and soft bodied green caterpillars which are found in
the dhuh grass that grows by the water channels and in almost every
cultivated field. Particularly do these green grasshoppers damage
the rice crops, but for Bulbuls food they are ideal. But they must
be prepared for eating and so the little boys take the unfortunate
insects, and the green is sometimes very beautiful, and they pull off
the grasshoppers' long legs and the hard wings and wing cases ;
then they pinch off the hard head and have left a soft, green body.

This is popped into the young expectant Bulbul's open beak.
This sounds cruel, but mother and father Bulbul probably treat
the grasshoppers in much the same way, but they beat them upon
a branch to shake off the legs, and heads, and wings. Once up at
Goonoor, in the Nilgiri hills, I watched a pair of Red-whiskered
feed their young in a nest made largely of fallen pine needles,
or what looked like fallen pine needles, and fine rootlets, which was
built in a thick hedge like a thick, well-trimmed privet hedge.
For the first week the parents seemed to bring only insects, small
beetles, caterpillars, grasshoppers, and so on, but then they started
to bring beaksful of tomato from tomato plants that were growing
wild nearby. And if grasshoppers are not available parched gram
flour, called Satto, that is gram flour made into the consistency of
putty, when made and fed as little pellets will do. But gram flour
must not be continued when the birds are old enough to feed
themselves because it is a very strong food and though good for
Mynas even when they are grown-up, must, with young Bulbuls,
be discontinued when they are grown-up. I once reared three
Bulbuls on this " Satto " and grasshoppers, and they grew up into
fine, strong birds but their plumage when they moulted through was
black, the white spots on the tail feathers had gone and the red
beneath the tail was edged with black. I could not understand this
until I let one of them go and it remained about the garden,
coming back again to its companions in their cage on the verandah
until it moulted out again into the proper Bulbul plumage. This
was the wild food of the garden, I thought, and it is the gram which
made the Bulbuls black ; and so it was because when I started to
feed the other two on boiled carrots and plantain and sweetened
rice mould and grasshoppers, they moulted through in due course
in proper colours. And coming to more recent times, our cook,
Peter Fernandez, a most proper man and an extremely good cook,
has two Red-vented Bulbuls which he keeps with his wife and son
in his quarters, and he feeds them only on wheat chappatis (that is
unleavened bread, flat wheat-cakes prepared on a flat iron plate on a
fire) dipped in milk, and milk puddings and plantains. They are in
lovely plumage ; the red beneath the tail is pure and clear and
the white spots are on the tail, but they have had no gram flour
since they were very young. They are in quite small cages and the
hen last spring layed five eggs in her small cage. They were not

fertile because the cock Bulbul was so tame and jealous he fought
the hen, but the fact that the hen layed these five eggs in a small
cage in a small room inhabited by a family, seemed to me no mean
achievement. In England she would probably have wanted a
movable aviary 30 feet by 40 feet at least ! Indians, I think, are
extraordinarily good with birds. As one explained to me, " They
are our guests and not our servants," but as this gentleman kept
his birds in his bungalow and his wife and children in the outhouses
this appeared to me to be carrying avian hospitality to extreme
lengths, but this is not usual. But anyone seeing the Indian, Mali
(gardener), or Bhaya (watchman), with his tame Partridges must
come to the conclusion the birds are his honoured guests. Bulbuls
get extraordinarily tame. Two Red-vented Bulbuls we reared
from the nest, when they grew up used to fly out from their cage
every morning and every evening used to fly back and perch on the
curtain-pole. Then at night when they were asleep, our good butler,
Balthazar by name, would come with a small pair of steps, with
great dignity mount them and reach up and take the sleeping
Bulbuls and put them in their cage, safe for the night from rats.
Indeed I have only had one tamer bird and that was a little crested
Tit-mouse that was brought to me when I was in Belgaum in South
India. The little boys had fed it on the ubiquitous gram flour but
it had not suited it and it appeared almost in extremis ; but at that
time the asters in my garden were much troubled by green cater-
pillars, so I gave the baby Tit-mouse to the Mali (or gardener),
an old, old man. He put the little thing in the breast of his shirt
and as he went along pulling green caterpillars off the asters, so
he popped them into the baby's mouth. It throve exceedingly on
this diet and it was so tame that when I used to go on Circuit I
used to take it with me in a small bamboo cage and when we
reached a Circuit house, its cage would be hung on the wall of the
veranda, the door opened and out my little bird would fly to
return in an hour or two. This to my thinking is the ideal way of
keeping birds. One should keep tame birds, not wild ones. One
has then no captive in a cage but " an honoured guest

As the executive of the Avicultural Society of South Australia did not consider
that their members were giving enough information about the breeding of their
birds, a list of questions was drawn up, and it has been made a rule that as many
of them as possible must be answered when medals are applied for. This list of
questions has been forwarded to the Avicultural Society by Mr. R. R. Minchin,
Director of the Adelaide Zoological Gardens, and is given in detail below.
Dr. Hopkinson, who has recently returned from Australia, has also forwarded
a copy of this list and writes : " Below is the 4 Breeding Report 5 asked for by
the Avicultural Society of South Australia, from members claiming Medals

The Foreign Bird League.
The Secretary of the Foreign Bird League, of which the Marquess of Tavistock
is President, has written, suggesting that it would be to mutual advantage if
statements concerning the aims and membership of the League and of the Avicul-
tural Society were exchanged in their respective magazines. He forwards the
following note :--
Many members of the Avicultural Society are also members of the Foreign
Bird League, but there are quite a number who are not, and possibly some have
not yet heard of its activities. The League exists for the encouragement of the
keeping, breeding, and exhibition of Foreign Birds, and gives medals for breeders,
special prizes at the shows, and seeks to help and encourage aviculturists in various
ways. One of its chief activities is the publication of a bi-monthly magazine,
Foreign Birds, each issue of which includes a number of very helpful articles, as
well as the latest Foreign Bird news. The annual subscription is only five shillings,
for which six issues of the magazine are posted annually to all members, and new
members joining now receive the back numbers for the year and any others avail-
able. A specimen copy of the current issue will be sent, post paid, for one shilling.
There are many overseas members, and others will be welcomed. No proposer is
required for members of the Avicultural Society, and all who are not yet members
of the Foreign Bird League are invited to join. The secretary's name and address
are--Harold T. King, 41 Compton Road, Sherwood, Nottingham, England.
A note giving particulars of the Avicultural Society will shortly be published
in Foreign Birds.

BEHAVIOUR OF AUSTRALIAN SHELD-DUCK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975539125" page_id="56322819"  page_num="201" year="" vol="">
I read with great interest in the Notes of the May issue of the Avicultural
Magazine that M. Delacour states that he has found the Australian Sheld-duck
" quite peaceful in a mixed collection ". I should be interested to know if, as
I suspect, he refers to wild-caught birds ? I have myself found wild-caught
Australian Sheld-duck rather shy of other birds ; but three years ago I had a pair
of hand-reared birds, probably the first in Europe, and unfortunately the female
died. I still have the male who is as pugnacious as a Paradise Sheld-duck male,
though the female he is now paired with, a wild-caught bird, is nervous and
timid. I think the question of temper or, better put perhaps, " bossiness " is
only acquired when the bird is hand-reared. So much so is my male a boss that
I can't even keep him in a pen with the smaller geese. I found much the same
once with some wild-caught Magellan Geese, though as every one knows that a
hand-reared or captive bred Magellan is a bird to be feared by most other water
fowl. Captivity alters temperament in all waterfowl and changes dates of laying.
Wild caught Barnacle here laid for two or three years between 6th to 13th June,
but the eggs of hand-reared Barnacle, two clutches, were set by 1st May.

Referring to M. Delacour's note on the breeding of the Australian Sheld-
duck (C. tadornoides) in last month's issue of this Magazine.
During recent years the species has been continuously represented in the
collection at Lilford by one or more pairs since 1933. During that time one
and all of the eleven imported examples received have proved moderately peaceful
with other birds. It is only during the present season when a pair of those retained
decided to go to nest that they developed the Sheld-duck family's pugnacious
disposition, the female in this case proving quite as dangerously aggressive as
the male.
As to the nest, six eggs were laid beneath an inverted box placed in an isolated
shrubbery. During incubation, 30 days, the female frequently left the nest for
lengthy periods; the eggs, however, on examination always proved warm so
abundantly were they covered by a mass of grey down. The five young birds
hatched are growing well and I hope may be reared.

I am interested in this month's copy of the Avicultural Society Magazine
Notes about the Australian Sheld-duck. I have a pair and a half of these birds,
having lost one of the ducks this winter. I imported these duck last year. I do
not find them at all ill-tempered. In fact I find that they are rather timid ; though
they are quite the biggest of my ducks, they seem to let themselves be bullied by
most of the other ducks. I had to move my Ruddy and South African Sheld-
duck to another pond, because they never left the Australians alone. They, poor
birds, were really frightened and kept right away from the rest. I also have a
pair and a half of Radjah Sheld-duck (Tadorna Radjah) : these I find far more ill-
tempered. They have only just been put on my water, as all through the winter I
kept them in a small pen and shut them up at night, as they came straight from
the tropics to England. Since they have been put with the other ducks, I notice
that they are quite full of their own importance and give any other duck that is
in their way a good peck ! Also my Maned Geese set about the Australian Sheld-
duck, in fact I must say that my Australian Sheld-duck seem very docile, and some-
what if one might call " Duck Pecked ".

After reading two articles in the May edition of this Magazine, written by two
friends of mine, Mr. P. Lambert and Mr. G. Beever, I decided to ask the Editor
if she could find a little room for me to talk to some of my Pheasant friends. As
Mr. Lambert can testify, I am a very keen admirer of Pheasants, and I always
used to lay claim to having the finest collection of these birds in England. But
I think I must now surrender that title to Mr. Spedan Lewis. I cannot compete with
him. I am very pleased that he has such a truly marvellous collection, as it has
been so difficult, if not impossible, to obtain fresh blood in some of the rare species.
I am now hoping to be able to do that.
I paid a visit to Leckford and was taken round the aviaries by Mr. Jones, and I
enjoyed every minute of it. I found Mr. Jones a very keen and intelligent Curator,
and I wish him the best of luck.
As regards my own collection. I certainly must claim to have a good one.

My favourites are the Peacock Pheasants and the Tragopan family. Of the former
group I have the three usual species, Chinquis, Germain, and Bronze-tail.
I should dearly like to have the Palawan, but I am afraid times are not what they
used to be with me. I once had two pairs of these birds, and I gave the very high
price of #65 per pair ! That was, needless to say, some years ago. I also had two
pairs of Bulwers at the same time. Of the Tragopan family, I have all but the
Western. What wouldn't I give for a pair of these wonderful birds. I don't think
they have ever been imported alive into this country. I have most of the other
species of Pheasants, except the Hokis, which I do not think are suitable for
aviaries and besides, I have not the accommodation for them. I have kept both
the Brown and Blue, but not the White !
Mr. Wormald will be pleased to know that I have a very fine pair of Versicolors,
in fact two pairs, both cocks were imported direct from Japan. I believe I know
of one more imported cock for sale in this country. Versicolors are beautiful birds,
but they have two snags. I have nearly always found them very timid birds, and
the chicks are difficult to rear. I hope Mrs. Lambert will succeed in rearing some, if
we are lucky enough to get fertile eggs.
That one word fertile haunts me ! How many eggs do I get which are not fertile.
I am afraid this is going to be a bad year for fertility. It may be a little soon
to judge, but certainly the first clutches have not turned out well. And can one be
surprised. For weeks now there has been, every day and all day, a biting north-
east wind blowing, sometimes at gale force. It is a wonder to me that any eggs are
fertile with such cruel weather. To call it spring is a farce.
My Peacock Pheasants usually prove the most fertile. Last year all three
species laid fertile eggs. A curious thing has happened this year in my aviaries.
I have never known so many Pheasants wanting to incubate their own eggs. At
the present moment I have the following Pheasants sitting : Golden, Elliot,
Swinhoe, Amherst, Monal, and Crestless Fireback, and very soon the Chinquis
will want to sit. I have never heard of a Monaul hen wanting to sit. And curious
to relate that with the Elliot's it is my cock that sits, never his two hens. He is an
excellent sitter too. I do not think I shall let him rear them. But I am rather
counting my chicks before they are hatched ! I have generally found Elliot's
very fertile, and they are sturdy chicks. Alas, they are very low in price now, and
seem hardly worth rearing, but they will be reared all the same. The only eggs
I do not bother with are Silvers and Goldens. My tame Magpie benefits
occasionally ! I think I have probably exceeded my limit, so I must lay down my
pen. I wish all lovers of Pheasants the best of luck with their breeding (of

A SUPPOSED HYBRID WHYDAH
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.875993666666667" page_id="56322821"  page_num="203" year="" vol="">
When judging the South African and Foreign Wild Bird Show, staged by
the Avicultural Society of South Africa, in Johannesburg last February, one bird
in particular attracted special attention. It belonged to the Whydah family and
most people believed it to be a cross between Steganura paradisea and Vidua regia.
It is about the same size, with the same shaped body and head as the Paradise
Whydah. Perhaps it is the unique tail which immediately attracts ones attention.
It has not got the same short, circular feathers, rising rather high from the base
of the tail, curving back a little lower down, which is so characteristic in the
widely known Paradise Whydah.

<bodyText confidence="0.995032775510205" page_id="56322822"  page_num="204" year="" vol="">
It has four fairly long tail feathers, similar to those of the Red-collared Whydah,
only they are even in length and very much prettier I fancy because each feather
is slightly twisted, cork-screw-wise, reminding one of a lightly twisted paper
streamer.
In summer plumage, the head, back, wings and tail are glossy black and a
broad, light, tan-coloured band covers the nape. The breast, stomach and under-
parts are the same pleasing golden-brown colour as those of the Shaft-tailed or
Queen Whydah. The legs, feet and beak are a reddish orange colour which is in
keeping with that of the Shaft-tailed Whydah, except that the beak is somewhat
larger. In winter condition it loses its beautiful long tail feathers, which are
replaced by an insignificant ugly brown tail about two inches long.
The black from the back, wings and head, and the effective golden brown
from the under parts all disappear, and the bird takes on that mixture of drab
brown and black colour associated with the Paradise Whydah in winter garb,
except that the black and dirty-white stripes at the sides of the head and face
resemble the Shaft Tail Whydah in the off season.
In full colour it Is a striking bird, immediately commanding attention, and one
which has never before been seen in captivity In South Africa, as far as we can
gather. It came from the outskirts of the district of Pretoria, Transvaal, and was
entered for competition as a hybrid and as such was awarded first prize for the
best hybrid on show.
Though not absolutely convinced in my own mind, my reasons for awarding
the first prize to this bird as a hybrid are :--first, the appearance of the bird,
shape, size, markings and colour, definitely give one the impression that it is a
cross between a Paradise and a Queen Whydah. Secondly, it was in splendid
condition and definitely the prettiest and most outstanding bird in its class. Also,
I felt that the exhibitor should be given the benefit of the doubt and every encour-
agement for the expense and trouble he had gone to, to stage the bird in such a
topping condition, rather than disqualify it for appearing in a doubtfully wrong
class. After all, it was not the exhibitor's fault that the judge was technically not
satisfied in his own mind. It is certainly a great rarity which we may never see
again. Had the bird been bred in captivity the whole matter would have been
cleared up, but the fact that it originated from the wilds keeps one thinking and
leaves always a little doubt in the mind. It was probably this same thought, of
the bird originating from the wilds, which dragged Dr. Roberts all the way from
Pretoria to Johannesburg to see the bird. Dr. Roberts, as everyone knows, is a very
keen ornithologist, always alert and keen to discover a new species. It did not
take many words to excite his keen bird-sense and curiosity, and he lost no time
before travelling to Johannesburg to see the bird for himself. After examining
it very carefully and weighing up all the pros and cons, with his shrewd judgment,
he eventually agreed that it was a hybrid between a Paradise and Shaft-tailed
Whydah.
The proud owner of this unique bird Is my good friend Mr. R. Gleugh, Father
and, until last year, President of the Avicultural Society of South Africa since its
inception. He paid a fancy price for this bird, but like a true bird-lover he says
it is worth it. Ultimately it will be destined for the South African Museum, Gape
Town.
If a hybrid, it would be interesting to learn whether there is any record of
such a breeding in captivity.

The Toucan-like Barbet is an inhabitant of the sub-tropical
zone of the Andes of Ecuador. It is found in forest between 4,000
feet and 6,000 feet, either singly or in pairs.
This Barbet is certainly quaint in its appearance with its gaudy
colours and large, brightly coloured bill, but in spite of these it is by
no means a conspicuous bird in its wild state, where the foliage and
light and shade offer a natural camouflage. It is not at all common
and has rather a restricted range, but its presence may be detected
by its call-notes. In common with some of the Barbets of the Old
World and some of the African Bush-Shrikes, the male and female
join in a sort of vocal duet, the call of the male being followed
instantly by the call of the female, and this is continued alternately
so quickly and so perfectly timed, that it sounds exactly like the
rhythmic call-notes of a single bird.
The large " toothed " bill has tremendous power, though what
purpose this serves it is difficult to say.
The diet is mainly wild fruits and berries, although insects form
part of the fare. In captivity these Barbets are particularly fond
of cockroaches.
There is very little difference in the coloration of the sexes,
but the male is slightly larger and has the black feathers of the crown
elongated to form a nuchal crest.

The multiplicity of species found in the bird world enables the
aviculturist to display his or her preference for certain species,
groups, or families. One prefers to keep the various species of
Thrush, another the ornamental Finches, and a third excels with
the Parrot group and so on. This is all to the good. Specialists
are thereby created, who for the most part are quite successful
in their various fields and so gain experience. I myself frequently
choose birds which do not appeal generally to the aviculturist.
They are said, perhaps, to be too dirty, too difficult to feed, too
large or too small, do not sing, etc. It must be admitted, of course,
that there are certain species of birds which can only be kept under
special conditions. It is also a fact that many aviculturists are
prejudiced against certain species. These include many Jays,
Bulbuls, Woodpeckers, Barbets, and others.
It is, however, just these despised species, the outlaws of avicul-
ture, which interest me most. It is always interesting to keep birds
which are found only rarely in aviaries. Even more interesting is
the possibility of making new observations, although this does not
mean that we know everything there is to know about the life-
histories and breeding habits even of the popular species in aviaries.
It is a matter of regret, for example, that up to the present there is
no detailed account of the breeding of the much-favoured Zebra
Finch. A detailed breeding report should include exact data
regarding incubation, development (weight) of the nestlings, and
so on.
During the last few years I have confined my attention to
the keeping of Bulbuls and Barbets. I give below descriptions
of various species of the latter bird.
In my opinion Barbets, from the point of view of mentality,
occupy a high position among aviary birds, and if obtained when
young, can easily be tamed and afford interesting glimpses of their
special character. Barbets resemble in many ways their South
American relatives, the Toucans, and appear to have much in
common with them.

The Barbet, whose habitat is the primeval forest, the wooded
banks of streams, and other tropical places, possesses a character
and behaviour which renders it very attractive to the aviculturist
who approaches it with an unbiased mind and makes a careful
study of the species. These birds soon learn to know their keeper,
even though shy and wild at first. They learn to distinguish him
quite well from other people and greet him in the manner
characteristic of the species. They are distinctive, for the most
part beautiful, birds whose character requires understanding.
To be properly appreciated they must be kept in large cages or in
aviaries. They require stout perches ; thick branches and twigs
are best, and these should be placed in the enclosure in natural
fashion and more or less horizontally.
Sleeping-boxes, like those for Parrakeets, or of a half-open
type, should always be provided. The birds like them at night.
Many species of Barbet go to sleep in the summer months while
it is still light and also wake up fairly late in the morning. Other
species, for example the Yellow-breasted Barbet, Trachyphonus
margaritatus (Cretzschm.), are early risers and go to rest late. At
dawn already their rythmic call can be heard in the aviary. Oort's
Barbet, Cyanops -oorti (St. Mull.), and the Blue-cheeked Barbet,
Cyanops asiatica (Lath.), still sleep on. In between can be heard,
also at an early hour, the alarm-clock-like call of Levaillant's
Barbet, Trachyphonus cafer (Vieilh), a beautiful characteristic species.
Only when it is quite light the low, solemn note, like that of the
drum of a primitive people, of the Javan Great-billed Barbet,
Ghoiorhea javensis (Horsf.), is heard in the peculiar rhythm of a
world strange to us.
Each species has its peculiarities, which will be described at
greater length when the individual species is dealt with. One often
hears that Barbets cannot be kept with other species of birds,
which is a somewhat sweeping statement. It is sometimes rather
more difficult to keep together Barbets of the same species, even
if they are a pair, than a Barbet with a bird of quite different
species of the same size and strength. The Yellow-breasted Barbet,
Trachyphonus margaritatus , and Levaillant's Barbet agree well with
one another and also with other species of birds. Naturally it is
not meant that small ornamental Finches and similar species
can be kept with the Barbet but, for instance, Sunbirds, Bulbuls,

208 R. NEUNZIG-ON THE CARE AND KEEPING OF BARBETS
and the like can be put with them without any difficulty. There
are exceptions even here. For example, a Blue-cheeked Barbet
can be kept quite well with the Timaliidae , e.g. the Red-cheeked
Scimitar Babbler, Pomatorhinus erythrogenys . Still larger Barbets mix
best with large Jays = Garrulax, or with Raven-like birds, etc.
And now for the feeding of these species. This is not in general
more difficult than that of Chloropsis, Tanagers, and other similar
species, perhaps even simpler, as well acclimatized Barbets are
quite robust. My Barbets, like all my insectivora, are given a
food mixture consisting of Spratt's bird-food, dried ants' eggs,
mealworm, musk, silkworm pupae, meatmeal, mountain-ash grits,
etc. The component parts are freshy mixed before each feed in
varying quantities in order to obtain as great a variety as possible.
One or other ingredient is sometimes left out or mixed in varying
quantities.
The ratio of the various foodstuffs is not constant, as the
food is often mixed quite casually. One cannot feed birds by chart.
A true aviculturist usually does the right thing by instinct. He has
to take into account the constitutions of his charges and other
details of that kind. Neither can there be any hard and fast rule
about times of feeding. A bird is a living organism, dependent on
his environment and its influences, which alter daily or even
hourly and thereby affect him. To this must be added the quality
of the food. A bird eats less of a substantial food than he does of
one poor in content.
To return to the feeding of my Barbets. The above-mentioned
mixture is scalded with boiling water and then kneaded with fresh
grated carrots, so that it forms a light, flaky mass. Cream-cheese
made with skim milk is often added, together with the whey, as
this contains mineral salts. In addition the Barbets are given sliced
fruit or berries, according to the time of year. They are fond of
apples, pears, bananas, cherries, plums, etc. It is absolutely essential
that fruit be regarded as an extra, so that the Barbets are obliged
to eat the mash. Newly introduced Barbets are often accustomed
to fruit alone. They must be trained gradually to take the mash.
Bananas, for example, can be spread with the mash, so that some
portion is taken with the fruit. Small pieces of raw bullock's heart,
or other easily digested meat, may be given now and then. There
are Barbets, however, that will not eat raw flesh or mealworms.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999584871794872" page_id="56322837"  page_num="209" year="" vol="">
The quantity of fruit must be reduced gradually and that of the
mash increased, until the bird is fully accustomed to the latter food.
All Barbets soon accustom themselves to a sweet drink which
I concoct with boiling water, oatmeal, and cooking sugar, to which
is added syrup and sweetened condensed milk. The drink is given
in the early afternoon, after which the fruit is entirely devoured.
This drink is a favourite with many species of birds such as Bulbuls,
Honey-eaters, Tanagers, Timalias, etc. A little levurinose yeast
may be added. This I always do in the case of the smaller Honey-
eaters-- Meliphagida --a good time before their moult, which it is
supposed to aid. However, this is not always the case I have
observed, although there is no doubt that the yeast preparation
enriches the drink with strengthening properties. The amount
of excretion from Barbets depends largely on the quality of the
food. The better the food, the less the excretion.
I have also observed that the Yellow-breasted and Levaillant's
Barbets live quite peaceably together. On the other hand, two
Blue-cheeked Barbets only agreed at intervals. Certainly the
supposed female turned out later to be a male. A pair of Oort's
Barbets, however, failed also to agree at times. The last-named
species had to be accustomed gradually one to the other, even when
it was a case of the sexes. This can be done in various ways. I usually
place the respective birds in neighbouring cages, so that they can
see one another and become acquainted. When one sees them
hanging on the separating wire trying to get to each other, the
game is as a rule won, although not always. When both birds are
together they must be watched carefully to see if they quarrel.
In the case of Barbets, and many other species also, it is advisable
to place a number of food receptacles in various places. If these
methods are not successful, the birds should be placed in separate
cages side by side, the dividing wall being replaced by glass which
can be pulled out. After the birds have been separated for some
time, the glass is removed and the birds left together. As soon as
they chase one another, they should be separated again and placed
in each other's cage. This process should be repeated daily,
lengthening the period of time during which they are together,
until they are fully accustomed one to the other. In this way
I have familiarized the sexes of the most varied species of birds.
Barbets belong to the Scansores. Many species enjoy hammering

on branches and trunks. Others, like the Yellow-breasted Barbet,
which nests in holes like our Kingfishers, make their holes them-
selves by hammering on stone or masonry walls. Yellow-breasted
Barbets have been bred successfully in England (Avicultural
Magazine, 1927, p. 226) and Levaillant's Barbets in France
(.UOiseau , 1928). Unfortunately detailed breeding data are lacking,
neither is there anything known of further breeding successes. I might
mention here that in the case of Yellow-breasted and Levaillant's
Barbets the pairs maintain close contact, while in that of the Blue-
cheeked Barbet and other species they tend to live more apart.
It is my experience that Barbets are seldom ill for any length
of time. If mine became ill, they quickly died. The birds were
usually in good physical condition, but showed a considerable
enlargement of the liver, often accompanied by dropsy. Even well-
acclimatized Barbets will become suddenly ill and die very quickly.
Up to the present I have kept ten different species of Barbet,
of which six came from Asia and four from Africa. The smallest
species in my aviary was the--

<bodyText confidence="0.997740277777778" page_id="56322838"  page_num="210" year="" vol="">
This first came to Germany in 1937. The three birds which
came into my possession had unfortunately suffered very much
on the journey. Two died very soon, but the third bird, still in
juvenile plumage, recovered somewhat. It lived some weeks and
then died suddenly. I have seldom regretted the death of a bird
more than that of this little Barbet. He was a beautiful bird and
became very friendly. That is not to say that I have not been as
fond of other birds, or that I found them less charming.
These freshly introduced birds were apparently accustomed
only to bananas. With great patience and trouble I tried to induce
them to take a good mash with the addition of fruit. But the banana
diet had undermined their health and the consequences were
fatal. The surviving Barbet soon became a charming and lively
bird. He was very gay and his call note, somewhat like the bark of
a small dog, was frequently heard.
The species in question is divided throughout its area of distri-
bution into several geographical races, differentiated according to
size of beak and to a small extent by variation of colouring. The

Burmese race, X. h. indica Lath., inhabits Burma, Assam, East
Bengal, and Siam. The race inhabiting India, X. h. lutea Less.,
distinguished by the less sharply defined colouring of the underside,
is distributed over almost the whole of India, Ceylon, East and
West Bengal.
The partciular bird imported by me belonged to the race
inhabiting the Philippines and Sumatra. The coloration of these
birds, which are about the size of a small Bullfinch, but with a
much shorter tail, is very pretty. The blood-red colour of forehead
and crown is bordered at the back of the head by a broad black
streak. The hinder part of the cheeks and ear-coverts is pale
blue-green. The underside is whitish yellow, certain feathers being
streaked with dark green. Legs and feet are coral-red.
Another specimen, which arrived later in Berlin, was extremely
feeble and only lived a short time.
(2) Oort's Barbet, Cyanops oorti (St. Mull.)
This Barbet, offered by dealers occasionally in recent years, is
larger than the above-mentioned bird, but smaller than the more
frequently imported Blue-cheeked Barbet, Cyanops asiatica L.
The first two specimens of Oort's Barbet to arrive in my possession
were charming birds and quite tame and would come to my
hand. They were supposed to be a pair. However, it was an
extremely difficult matter to accustom them to one another and
I only succeeded in doing so after prolonged attempts. I placed
them at first in a small aviary with a pair of Black-crested Yellow
Bulbuls, Otocompsa flaviventris (Tickel). Later they were transferred
to a considerably larger aviary in company with a pair of Long-
tailed Sibia, Sibia picaoides simillima (Salv.), Orange-spotted Bulbul,
Pycnonotus bimaculatus barat Robinson and Kloss, and Black
Crake, Limnocorax niger (Gm.), respectively.
The two birds troubled very little about one another in general.
Occasionally they chased each other in apparently harmless fashion
and at night retired to separate sleeping-boxes. They entered the
boxes at an early hour, in summer even while it was still broad
daylight, about seven. Sometimes one of the Oort's Barbets
passed the night in a Harzer nesting-box. Their sleeping position
was rather like that of the Toucan, head under wing, tail erect.
These birds sleep very soundly and only stir at a loudish noise.

212 R. NEUNZIG-ON THE CARE AND KEEPING OF BARBETS
Both birds called mainly in the morning, but also at feeding-
time and in the late afternoon. The call of one was loud and strong,
while the other replied in the same tempo, but in softer, clearer
tone. The call is somewhat similar to that of the Blue-cheeked
Barbet, but softer. These birds lived for two years in my aviary
and then one morning towards the end of summer one of them did
not come out of the sleeping-box, and on investigation was found
to be dead. The bird was plump and lay in the box in the position
already described. On the previous day it had been quite lively
and seemed in good condition. The post-mortem revealed that the
supposed female was indeed one. Later on she was replaced by
another Oort's Barbet, apparently also a female. Neither bird
could bear the other and they had to be kept entirely separated.
The new bird, far from being tame and friendly, was extremely
wild. A fourth bird similarly could not be kept with any of its
own species. The two last-mentioned birds were smaller and more
beautifully coloured than the first-named and came apparently
from another region of the distribution area. The coloration of
the green plumage of Oort's Barbet after moult in captivity becomes
somewhat lighter with a slight bluish tinge. The red markings, too,
become somewhat lighter, while according to my observation the
red coloration of other Barbets does not change in captivity.
Newly introduced Oort's Barbets often require to be trained
to take a mash, as during transport they are frequently fed solely
on bananas, although this is not always the case. The transition to
another diet must be effected gradually in order to avoid disturbance
of the health of the bird. Tame Oort's Barbets are charming com-
panions and grow very fond of their keeper and greet him joyfully
with their own peculiar call. A single Oort's Barbet lived for some
time with a tame Jacana, for which he had the necessary respect.
(3) Blue-cheeked Barbet, Cyanops asiatica asiatica (Lath.)
The Blue-cheeked Barbet is the most frequently imported of
the Asiatic Barbets. A few specimens appear every year on the
market. Its distribution area is very great and is inhabited by
several geographical races :--
(a) Blue-cheeked Barbet, C. a. asiatica Lath., with a black
streak on the crown is found in Mussoorie, Kashmir, Nepal,

Baker, resembles the Blue-cheeked Barbet, except that the plumage
of the upper and underside is spotted red. It inhabits the
higher mountains south of the Brahmaputra, Manipur, and the
Lushai Mountains.
Apparently only the first-named race has been imported up
to now. The Blue-cheeked Barbet is a beautiful cage and aviary
bird. It is only seen to best advantage in a large enclosure. Like
all Barbets its plumage is always smooth and neat. If these birds
are very shy, they usually sit motionless, but ready to fly up at the
approach of a human being. As soon as they think they are
unobserved, or become tame, they are very lively, hop about,
hammer on the tree trunks and branches, slip into the sleeping-
boxes, or emit their rhythmic call. This call is a deep kuruwuk,
kuruwuk , often repeated.
I kept a beautiful Blue-cheeked Barbet for several years. He
was always in bright plumage and ate the usual mash and requisite
fruit. He would never touch raw flesh or mealworms. In fact I must
say that the above-mentioned Asiatic forms very seldom, if ever,
eat raw flesh, still less living mealworms, in contrast to the African
species I have kept. The Asiatics mentioned here seem to eat
much more fruit and less meat and insects while the Africans
prefer animal food with their fruit and berries. Perhaps this
resembles their diet in their wild state.
Later on a second bird was added to the male Barbet already
mentioned. This bird was smaller and duller in colouring, so that
the assumption that it was a female appeared justified. At first
both birds agreed very well. They only chased one another now
and then in a harmless manner. In general they took very little
notice of one another. However, one day in July the chase became
more violent. I put it down to breeding instinct, as both birds
disappeared at times during the day into the nesting holes. But one
day I found the weaker bird mortally wounded on the floor of the
nesting-box. It had been killed by its companion. The post-
mortem revealed that it was a male. Strange to relate, I never

heard the typical call from the smaller bird. Unfortunately it is
very difficult to distinguish the sexes in the case of a number of
Barbets.
The Blue-cheeked Barbet lived in an aviary in company with
a pair of Red-cheeked Scimitar Babblers, Pomatorhinus erythrogenys
Vig., which they did not attack at all and which left the Barbets
in peace also. I never gained the impression that the Blue-cheeked
Barbets are aggressive with birds of the same strength. Like Oort's
Barbet, they go to their sleeping-holes during the summer months
in the full daylight of the late afternoon and only appear the next
morning when it is quite light. The male each time greeted the
new day with a repetition of his rhythmic calls, which echoed
loudly through the house, but were quite pleasant to hear. He
often called too at midday and again in the afternoon.

During my visit to Australia I had the good luck to be invited
by Mr. Gebhardt to stay for a time at his homestead which is
about sixty miles from the nearest railway station of Burra-Burra,
in the north-eastern part of South Australia. Mr. Gebhardt is a
member of the South Australian Avicultural Society and has many
interesting birds, most of them of local origin and plentiful in the
district, though to us at Home they would constitute great rarities.
There was a Bare-eyed Cockatoo which had been in
Mrs. Gebhardt's possession for over twenty-seven years. This bird was
a good talker, as in fact were most of the other Cockatoos, especially
a Lemon-crest which had the most remarkable repertoire, being
able to repeat whole sentences ; it could also give a very realistic
performance of a baby crying and shrieking for its mother. There
were two of these birds both in the most perfect condition. The
only wild Lemon-crests I saw were in the National Park in New
South Wales, though I saw dozens in captivity in various parts

of Australia. These are usually kept as pets on sheep stations in
rather inadequate cages, but nevertheless they always looked in
very good condition and were, in most cases, accomplished talkers,
those belonging to Mr. Gebhardt being the best I heard. One of
them would hold long unintelligible conversations which it had
obviously heard from a distance. Often tame and talking birds of
this species are very savage.
The wild birds which I saw were in the tall forest trees in a very
beautiful gully. The noise they were making was nothing short of
terrible and all the while they were displaying their handsome
yellow crests. There were not a great many birds and I was rather
surprised to find them living in a forest. In some parts of Australia
they are found in huge flocks and do a considerable amount of
damage to grain and fruit, but one can hardly expect anything else
when Man has done his best to destroy the birds' natural food.
There are a great many in the various Australian Zoos, in most
cases pets whose owners have grown tired of them, and most can
repeat the inevitable " Scratch Cocky ", " Hello Cocky " or " Cocky
Wants a Drink ". As in the case of the African Greys and the
Amazons which are always known as " Pollies ", so the Cockatoos
are seldom if ever called anything but " Cocky ". To get back
to Mr. Gebhardt's, there were many fine Parrakeets including
Adelaides, Mealy Rosellas, and a perfect Blue Bonnet which had
been in the owner's possession for, I think, eight or nine years.
Mr. Gebhardt told me that he hand-reared many of this species and
if he sold any to the dealers in Adelaide he only got 4s. 6d. a pair
for them. What would such birds be worth in England now ?
Amongst the others I noticed Common Rosellas or, as they are
called in Australia, Eastern Rosellas, which I think is the best
name, Port Lincolns, Barnards, Bourkes, these latter were very
prolific and I noticed quite a little flock of them. To continue with
the Parrakeets, there were also Elegants, Turquoisines, Redrumps,
Cockatiels, and Budgerigars.
Considering that Lagoon Station appeared, at least to a person
like myself from over-crowded England, rather isolated, being about
sixty miles from a railway station and only in touch with it by means
of a car which called once a week bringing the mail and supplies,
the aviaries were excellent, well made and consisting mainly of
small breeding pens. The birds were also as well looked after as

any I saw in Australia. Mr. Gebhardt feeds his birds on a large
amount of seed in the ear, which he grows himself, and this accounts
no doubt for the fine condition of most of the birds. My host was
a keen bird observer and had lived all his life in the Bush. I met old
favourites around Lagoon Station ; one of them was our old friend
the Galah. I shall never forget my first sight of these birds. It was
on the way up from the railhead. We started at 5.30 in the morning
from the hotel where I had been staying overnight. We left in a
fourteen-year-old Dodge car, almost unrecognizable under a welter
of sacks, packages, boxes, etc., to be distributed on the weekly
round at the various sheep stations. At first sight it might have
been just one huge pile of baggage, but on closer acquaintance one
noticed the wheels, so that we could tell that it was a car ! My
case was placed with other packages on the bonnet, just allowing
the driver to see where he was going.
It was still very early morning when we passed through the
" Salt " bush country. The land was as flat as the surface of the
ocean, the sky, which looked like an inverted dome above the earth,
was that pale celestial blue which betokens a fierce heat later on.
In fact the thermometer did go up to 112 0 F. As far as the eye could
see the earth was a monotone of the softest dove-grey with the
" salt " bushes ; suddenly there rose up a flock of these old
favourites, the Rose-breasted Cockatoos, or Galahs as they are called
in Australia. Their upper plumage matched exactly with the grey
of the bushes, but between the two greys, that of the birds and that
of the vegetation, was a glow of the most beautiful pale rose pink.
That flush of softest rose-pink between the greys was superb. Oh,
how different our friend looked in his immaculate freshness to the
poor soiled and half-poisoned creatures we see in stuffy living rooms
at home. No bird, I thought on that sunlit morning in far off
friendly Australia, could look more lovely and I felt glad that there
were restrictions which prohibited these birds of the wide open
spaces of Australia being used as articles of commercial exploitation
and forced to exist for the rest of their lives under an inverted
wire bell. As we sped on more and more vast flocks rose up as we
disturbed them feeding on the ground, but my first sight will ever
remain an indelible impression, a picture of the softest pastel blue,
greys, and pinks. And as I write these notes the air is thick with
Galahs, as flock after flock swarm around the dam to drink, every

available perch is crowded, fences, posts, wires, as well as all
round the edge of the water, those birds which cannot find a space
fly over the water and drink on the wing very much like a Swallow.
What a * galaxy of old favourites I saw that day, hosts
of Budgerigars rising in small warbling flocks from the ground.
For a moment I almost felt like asking my companion if they had
escaped from a nearby aviary, for a Budgie in the open, like a
Canary, gives one the impression that it is an escaped bird.
As we sped along swift-winged Parrakeets flashed across our
pathway, more old favourites again, Manycolours, lovely Barnards,
Blue Bonnets, and when at last I reached the homestead and was
sitting beside the dam amazed at the wealth of bird life around me,
I heard one sound that made me feel strangely at home, the tiny
thin " penny trumpet 55 song of the Zebra Finches.
Mr. Gebhardt's homestead was a bird lover's dream of heaven ;
set far away from the noisy multitudes and nerve racking rush of the
present day, in a country where the grey of the " Salt 53 bushes
mingled with the sombre green of the " Bull Oaks 33 , and where
most of the landscape seemed sky. Even at sea there never seemed
quite so much sky as there, and one realized the full significance
of that well worn phrase, " the wide open spaces . 33
The sight of sights, and one for which I was wholly unprepared,
was when a vast concourse of those most beautiful birds. Lead-
beater's or Major Mitchell Cockatoos, streamed across my line
of vision ; no spectacular play or film ever thrilled me as did that
galaxy of colour which unfolded itself before my eyes. Vast streams
of spotless white suffused with--I can never quite decide whether
it is pale raspberry pink or pale pinkish salmon, possibly it is
between both colours--like some vast floating scarf streamed
between me and the dark vegetation. No words of mine can ever
convey the ethereal beauty of those long strings of lovely birds.
Every bird seems to take on an added beauty in its proper setting ;
but no picture was ever framed to throw up its beauty as the setting
threw up the beauty of these birds. Lovely as they had always
appeared to me, here they seemed a hundred per cent more so.
They had come to drink at the water and for many hours while I was
staying at Lagoon Station I watched them in the evenings come to
quench their thirst at the dam or the small pools near at hand.
Sometimes a flock settled on a dead tree making it look as though

it were covered with raspberry pink snow, but strange to say when
the birds alighted in a " Bull oak " tree they seemed to vanish into
thin air and they were quite invisible even at a few yards distance.
I used to watch the birds feeding on the fruits of a low spreading
bush, the fruits were slightly smaller than " hip 55 berries, and had
a small stone and were very sweet and pleasant to the taste. If
I disturbed a flock when they were feeding they seemed very
annoyed, wheeling round and round, sometimes turning back and
hanging in the air, quite close and shrieking their anger at me.
The noise was almost pleasant compared to that made by the
Gang-Gang or the Lemon-crested Cockatoos. Mr. Gebhardt told
me that he often took the young ones and hand-reared them, at
one time having as many as fourteen ; but the birds, in spite of
their very high price in England, fetch only 8 s. 6d. each when sold
in Adelaide.
The Leadbeater's Cockatoo is not common except in certain
areas, and I saw very few in captivity in Australia, which is rather
surprising as it is certainly the most beautiful of the Cockatoo
family and to my mind one of the most beautiful of Parrots. For
a few days I went out sheep driving with Mr. Gebhardt so that
I could see something of the bird life in the surrounding districts,
and when we camped at night near a dam or bore we were always
rewarded by seeing some of these birds come down to drink. It
was very noticeable that the birds, even though in flocks, were in
definite pairs and if one lingered on to drink its mate would
always wait for it on the top of a near-by tree. Often while he or
she was waiting they would display their beautiful yellow, salmon,
and white crest, in the same manner as a Lemon-crest, and when
the other bird joined the one in the tree they would go through
a mutual display in which they threw their crests forward and
opened their wings and tail to show the beautiful salmon suffusion.
At a small dam where we stopped for the night I saw my first
wild specimens of that lovely Parrakeet, the Manycolour. Sitting
with our backs to the setting sun we watched a male and female
settle on a wire fence preliminary to drinking, and how vivid their
colours looked in the sun's rays. Instead of flying down to drink
they skimmed over the surface, scooping up the water as they
flew in the manner of a Swallow, though later on they did settle
by the water's edge and have a drink.

Afterwards I saw small flocks of these birds, often very difficult
to tell at a distance, or on the wing, from the very much larger
Barnards ; as the flight is S0 swift and the green so brilliant I often
got confused with them. When once settled in the dark " Bull
Oaks 53 it was almost impossible to detect them ; they kept
perfectly still and quiet until one was almost under the tree, then
they flew from the opposite side with their swift direct flight.
This is another very difficult Parrot when first caught, and
unfortunately the mortality is very distressing ; in fact all the
Psephotus Parrakeets are the same, the Blue Bonnets especially.
I should not think that 10 per cent of these Parrakeets survive the
first six months of captivity. I was amazed when in Australia at
the very high mortality amongst all species of freshly caught
Parrakeets.
Another lovely Parrakeet which is very common in its natural
habitat, but very rare in our aviaries in England is the Barnard's.
I saw my first wild ones on the way up the Lagoon Station and
afterwards I became well acquainted with them.
On the way to Lagoon Station we called in at a homestead
for tea where there was a most beautiful specimen of this Parrakeet.
It was aggressively tame and could talk and whistle tunes and,
though in a very inadequate cage, was in perfect condition.
These birds eat the cultivated fruits and nuts and are shot in
large numbers ; one person who kept snakes as pets had a large
aviary of these Parrakeets and also Rock Pebblers which he fed
to his snakes ! In flight these birds are exceedingly swift and as
they flash past the sombre green of the trees they look particularly
brilliant. So tame and familiar did the wild birds become around
Lagoon Station that they would enter the open Parrot cages, whose
rightful occupants had been let out, and eat the seed. Even if
they were fastened up, "just to larn 'em , 35 they returned the next
day. I saw a good many of these birds in captivity, but I do not
think any one bothers to breed them as they are so common ;
only is. Is paid for hand-reared birds.
There are seven distinct species of Rosellas, though in England
they go under the heading of " Parrakeets 53 all except the one we
call the Common Rosella. With one exception all these birds are
very distinct, but showing the family characteristics such as the
lacing on the mantle and scapulars, the violet outer tail feathers,

<bodyText confidence="0.999364974358974" page_id="56322848"  page_num="220" year="" vol="">
and the pale blue cheek patches. Two of the Rosellas, the Crimson,
known in England as the Pennant's Parrakeet, and the Yellow
Rosella, known as the Yellow-rumped Parrakeet, merge from one
to the other, and in the districts between the ranges of these two
birds is another Rosella which shows traces of both species, this
is known as the Adelaide Rosella. As we get nearer the habitat
of the Crimson Rosella, the Adelaide becomes redder until it at
last merges into the Crimson, and if we go in the other direction
the Adelaide becomes a paler colour until it, too, is indistinguishable
from the Yellow. This species is very variable, even in one district
some birds being very fine specimens and others looking like
nondescript hybrids, the yellow ones which are suffused with
brick red are the most beautiful, the suffusion usually being in the
centre of the breast and on the forehead. Even birds from Adelaide
itself are apt to be rather red. I obtained three very fine specimens
with a strong brick red suffusion.
I saw a good many wild ones around the country districts of
Adelaide and their habits seem very similar to those of the Crimson
Rosella, though they seemed to frequent the more open lands and
not so much the forested regions, although there were no thick
forests like those in Victoria. The Adelaides didn't look half as
brilliant in flight as did the Crimsons, though at close quarters
I think some of the Adelaides are the brighter coloured birds.
I saw very few in captivity in Australia ; for one thing they are
very common around Adelaide and are not thought much of;
their habitat is rather restricted and they do not seem to be sent
away from the Adelaide district.
The Australian Bee-eater was very common around the dam
and the homestead ; in its actions it differs in no way from the
rest of the Bee-eaters, which are very homogeneous in the habits.
Taking up its position on point of vantage, usually on the dead
limb of a tree or a wire fence or perhaps on a telegraph wire, the
birds make short excursions after flying insects.
In Australia this bird has the appropriate name of " Rainbow "
Bird, but this might easily apply to a good many of Australia's
birds especially the Parrots. A family of these birds lived around
the homestead and could be seen especially in the evenings on the
wire fences when the old birds hawked for insects to feed the young
ones. It is often found about the dams where, because of the sheep

over the water and it is surprising how many people mistake it
for a Kingfisher.

The 1906 volume of the Magazine, being Vol. IV of the
New Series, which commenced as usual in November of the previous
year, is well up to standard, though it contained only six coloured
plates. There are, however, in it some good black and white
plates and text illustrations. It commences with a coloured plate
of the Black-throated Lorikeet ( Trichoglossus nigrigularis) with an
article on the species by W. A. Harding. It occurs in the Aru
Islands and this was one of the first imported into Europe ; then
there is an account by Mrs. Mitchell of the successful breeding of
Forsten's Lorikeet (T. forsteni). Albert J. Salter writes on the
breeding of the King Parrakeet ( Aprosmictus scapularis), the
birds having elected to produce their family on the ground in a
corner of the flight close to a footpath. Two young birds were
hatched though only one successfully reared.
Mrs. Howard Williams supplies an interesting article on the
breeding of the Pileated Finch ( Coryphospingus pileatus) , for which
she received the Society's Medal. The nest was built in a laurel
bush, at the end of a shoot which had been topped and had
sprouted out all round after the manner of a rhododendron when
the flower has fallen. All sorts of odds and ends had been used
to fill up the space between the young shoots, and on this foundation
was built an open nest entirely composed of fibre from pieces of
an old rope. There was no lining of any kind and the nest was
tiny, barely two inches across, and shallow. Three white eggs,
very large for the size of the bird, were laid, and all hatched in
due course, though the period of incubation is not given. The

young were fed mainly upon mealworms and soft food and grew
very rapidly. One died as the result of a storm, but the other two
were reared.
In an article entitled "The Commonsense of Bird Protection 35
I tried to impress upon readers the great need for bird protection
conducted on commonsense lines and by those " who are not
swayed by mere blind sentiment ". Reginald Phillipps contributes
three articles on the Regent Bird ( Sericulus melinus), the male of
which is a remarkably handsome bird in his dress of gold and
black. In his aviary in Kensington a pair of these birds were kept
with such success that the male constructed his bower and his
mate her nest in which she hatched and reared two young birds,
a very fine achievement in aviculture.
Mrs. Howard Williams describes the breeding of the Pectoral
Finch ( Munia pectoralis ), for which success the Society's Medal was
awarded. The nest was made in a rush basket and no less than
seven young birds were hatched and, in due course, left the
nest in twos, with about two days' intervals between.
A medal was also awarded to Mr. Teschemaker for successfully
breeding the Green Avadavat ( Stictospiza formosa ) for the first time.
A letter appears, written by myself, recording the prolificacy of the
Diamond Dove ( Geopelia cuneata ). " Two pairs were liberated into
my largest aviary last April (1905) and quickly commenced to
build their fragile nests in any branch that offered a platform for
a nest no more than two inches in diameter. ... I have recently
caught them up for the winter and find their number has increased
from four to seventeen." Walter Goodfellow was at this time a very
successful collector of rare birds from various distant parts of the
world, and amongst the treasures he brought home was a Lorikeet
from the Mountains of Mindanao, in the Southern Philippines.
It was new to science and, as he was collecting for Mrs. Johnstone,
this bird was named Trichoglossus johnstoniae by Dr. Hartert at a
meeting of the British Ornithologists' Club It is one of the green
type of Lorikeets with red on the head and closely related to those
which have been placed in the genera Psitteuteles and Ptilosclera,
genera which, as Dr. Hartert pointed out, only differed in colora-
tion from Trichoglossus and should therefore not be separated.
A good coloured plate of the species is given.

experienced aviculturist, in addition to being a very charming
personality. Half a century ago he had a great reputation both in
Germany and Great Britain as an authority upon cage birds,
little inferior to that of his friend Carl Russ. In the early years of
the century he came to live in London and, on the introduction
of his friend and compatriot, Dr. Gunther, was elected a member
of the Council of the Zoological Society ; and it was he who
persuaded the late Mr. Czarnikow to defray the cost of building
the first Bird House at the Zoo (now converted into a Tortoise
House). But he considered that all captive birds thrived better
in cages than in aviaries and so, when the house was first built it
contained no aviaries but row upon row of comparatively small
cages. In the volume under review Wiener writes a long article
" On the size of Aviaries and Cages ", in which he expresses his
views that in the latter birds not only show to better advantage
but actually thrive better than in aviaries. His article brought
forth a good many letters in the Correspondence columns, the
majority of the writers being decidedly in favour of aviaries where
possible as opposed to cages.
The arrival at the Zoological Gardens of a living Humming
Bird, a specimen of the Bolivian Violet-eared species ( Petasophora
iolata) is reported. It appears to have been the first living Humming
Bird ever received at the Zoo, though not the first to reach England.
It lived a fortnight Another new arrival is recorded at the Zoo
in the form of specimens of the Quail Finch (Ortygospiza poly zona ),
which was new to the collection though not to aviculture for,
in a subsequent letter, Mr. Osbaldeston mentions a previous
importation.
Another new importation recorded is that of the Bald-headed
Starling ( Sarcops calvus ) of which Mrs. Johnstone received three
specimens, collected by Walter Goodfellow in the Philippines.

E. G. B. Meade-Waldo on Sandgrouse in general, a group that
he had studied much both in the wild state and in captivity. He
mentions the habit of this group of conveying water to their young,
and as this has been considered by some ornithologists to be merely
a habit acquired by captive birds, I would like to quote from him
here. He writes :--

224 D. SETH-SMITH-EARLY YEARS OF AVICULTURAL SOCIETY
" The extraordinary method employed by the parent Sand-
grouse, of conveying water to their young by saturating the feathers
of their breasts, was first described by me in 1895, and since by
Mr. St. Quintin in his interesting account of the successful rearing
of the Lesser Pintailed Sandgrouse (P. exustus). I have had the
good fortune to see the males of Pterocles arenarius , the Black-
breasted Sandgrouse and Pteroclurus alchatus , the Greater Pintailed
Sandgrouse, getting water for their young in a wild state, but,
had I not seen it administered in confinement, would have con-
sidered them to have been demented birds trying to dust in mud
and water when unlimited dusting ground surrounded them on
every side. In very waterless districts where the only water pro-
curable was from deep wells situated at great distances from one
another, this method of procuring water must be most precarious,
for I saw P. arenarius waiting by the wells and going to the muddy
spots where the skins used to be laid before being loaded on to the
camels, and where water was slopped over from the troughs
where the animals drank. I also saw them fly over to the prickly
Zareba surrounding the tent-villages and go to where there was
a soft spot for the same purpose. I did see P. alchatus actually soaking
themselves ; they were much wilder and also in less arid places,
but I repeatedly saw cocks pass over, their white breasts soaked in
mud and water. Doubtless the whole group of Sandgrouse obtain
water in this manner although I can only answer for the three
species mentioned."
Captain B. R. Horsbrugh writes on Aviculture in South Africa
where there is " constant sunlight ", though the nights are often
very cold and windy, and Collingwood Ingram gives an account
of a visit he paid to a Guacharo Cave in Trinidad. This curious,
fruit-eating bird called also the " Diablotin " or " Little Devil ",
is known to science as Steatornis caripensis and is of great interest
as it occupies a family all to itself. Superficially it resembles a
Nightjar and lives by day in dark caves where it forms its nest
upon a ledge. The young, which are very fat, are much sought
after by the natives for food.
Mr. W. G. Perceval contributes some notes on birds in the
Sudan, the most interesting, I think, being one on the habit of the
young Egyptian Plover of burying itself in sand. He writes :

For many years I have been banding Evening Grosbeaks, and
I was particularly interested in their migration. The general
belief that these birds are winter visitors, and migrate only when
the cold weather approaches, left me sceptical. I came to the
conclusion that these birds have no fixed migration.
To show that my contention is correct, I may point to the
following facts :--
It has been proven beyond any doubt that species such as
Cowbirds, Cat Birds, Song Sparrows, American Goldfinches,
Purple Finches, and the most reliable of all the Baltimore Oriole,
invariably return to the same locality. Returns are numerous.
In one instance, immature male Baltimore Oriole, No. 691257,
banded by me on 10th August, 1930, at 140 Luxton Avenue,
Winnipeg, Canada, was taken alive from a cat by A. W. Gillman,

There was not a single bird retaken the year after being banded.
However, repeats during the season were numerous, some birds
entered the traps four and five times daily, and kept it up for
weeks. Some specimens, when released, did not bother to fly
away, just waited a short distance from the traps ready to re-enter
as soon as the coast was clear for another good feed. There were
birds retaken after an absence of two and four years but, in
proportion to the number banded, few and far between.
The following is a record of two birds, which is particularly
interesting --
A. 287801 : Evening Grosbeak, banded 29th March, 1932,
at Mayville, Michigan, by Dr. H. A. Barbour, was trapped and
released by me on 27th March, 1937, at Lot 54, East Kildonan,
Canada.
A. 35-200461 : Evening Grosbeak, banded by me on Lot 54,
East Kildonan, Canada, on 19th March, 1935, was trapped and
released on 18th March, 1937, by M. J. McGee, 603 South Street,
Sault St. Marie, Michigan.
As will be noted these birds were taken the same month but
in a different year far away from their original banding station.
In my opinion, migration is solely dictated by the food problem.
As long as maple and poplar seeds are plentiful, the birds stay.
Climatic conditions have nothing whatsoever to do with their
migration. These birds can stand 40 below just as well as 100 degrees
in the shade. Occasionally a few pairs stay all year in the same
locality to breed.
On 24th July, 1934, I observed two old birds feeding three
young in a pasture road at Petersfield, Canada. They were one
young male and two young hens ; the birds still had some down

feathers on their head and very short tail. They were quite fearless
and could be approached within 10 yards without making any
attempt to fly away. I also had ample opportunity to observe
several pairs which have been kept for many years in my aviaries.
The birds are immune to heat or cold and nest and breed regularly
by the middle of July, when the temperature always hovers between
90 and 100 degrees in the shade.
The Evening Grosbeaks can safely be classed in the same category
as the American Crossbills, erratic wanderers. As long as there is
a plentiful supply of pine cones, these birds never leave their habitat.
The only time they move is when there is a scarcity of pine cones,
then they even come to town and invade our gardens.
The Evening Grosbeak always has been one of my favourites
in my aviaries. When in full plumage they are beautiful birds.
They soon become very tame and take sunflower seeds from the
hand. They don't bother other inmates of the same avairy, though
they snap at other birds, if they come too close. There is no harm
done, they make a clicking noise with their powerful beaks, and
that is enough for any other bird to move on. When feeding on
the ground with a number of other birds, they don't bother, as they
are too preoccupied cracking sunflower seeds.
To give an instance how tame and familiar the birds become
to their surroundings :--
One morning, when entering their flight after feeding, I must
have left the door partially open. As I was leaving home, I noticed
my seven Evenings running about the garden. As there was no
time to do anything in the matter, I opened the door to their
aviary, sprinkled a good feed of sunflowers and hemp on the
ground, hoping for the best. As there was running water in a
fountain in their flight, I turned this on as well. Great was my
excitement and pleasure on returning home, in the afternoon, to
find all seven birds back in their aviary feeding contentedly, some
of them splashing in the water. The breeding of this species is an
easy matter as far as laying eggs and hatching young, but rearing
their young is a different story.
The birds are poor nest builders ; the nest has to be provided
for them--a small basket or large strainer filled with soft hay. One
hen laid one egg on the ground of their flight. I put some grass in
a small strawberry basket tacked 4 feet from the ground to the

wall and placed the egg in it. Next morning, the hen was sitting
on the egg and incidentally laid another one.
The bird sat steady for twelve days. On the thirteenth, two
young were hatched. They were strong and healthy chicks, all
black with a fluffy down. They looked exactly like young Bull-
finches. They opened their beaks wide, asking to be fed. To my
amazement, the parents stood on the side of the nest and just
looked, never made any attempt to feed them, though the young
clamoured for food. The birds were provided with mealworms,
earth-worms, all kinds of seeds, green food, and apple. I tried to
feed them myself, but was not successful. After four days, I lost
them. The only way I managed to raise some was the method
adopted to raise Red-crested Cardinals.
I take a spin in the country, dig up a good-sized ant hill, fill
a canvas sugar bag with earth, ants, eggs, as it comes along.
The cap is securely tied, so the ants will not escape. Three times
daily I throw a shovelful of the contents of the bag on the floor
of the aviary. It is marvellous to watch how quickly the birds pick
up the running ants. They don't pick up just one, they grab a
beak-full, fly up to the nest and come back till there is nothing left.
I also found out that all Grosbeaks are very fond of fine chopped
raw meat ; they eat it with relish. When feeding young, I also
place a dish with this raw meat mixed with maggots. This also is
fed to their young. Mealworms and earth-worms are hardly
touched. Of course the birds get sunflower, canary, rape and a
little hemp, green foods and apple, also lots of fresh running water,
of which they are very fond.
The birds have only one nest a season, usually two or three
eggs comprise the clutch, seldom four. They breed in the middle
of June to end of July.
On 3rd August, 1938, I had three young leaving their nest ;
they were fed by their parents for another three days. They soon
learned to crack seeds by watching the old ones, they also were
given fine chopped hard-boiled egg.
I may point out that these birds are strictly protected, and can
only be kept by Government permit.

[Erythmra trichroa)
By C. N. Abrahams
Breeding these pretty birds and the Red-headed species, has
been one of our most cherished ambitions. Unfortunately, up to
the present, we have had no success with the latter, but we have had
some interesting experiences with the former. At the outset it
seemed as though fate was against us, and we would be doomed to
failure. The first pair we received, from a friend in Nottingham,
England, arrived suffering from white diarrhoea. We did all we
possibly could to pull them round, but unfortunately they were too
far gone. Arriving here in the middle of our miserably wet winter,
their chances were still further reduced, and we could not save them.
Another pair was sent, but only one arrived. Misfortune befell
them on board ship, and only the cock reached Cape Town. The
hen is still at sea.
So we were left with a lone cock, until some months later when
we received a mate for it. These were in one of the breeding aviaries,
together with a pair of Gouldians, Hood Siskins, and Owl Finches.
After some months had passed, a hurried nest was made of green
seeding grass, in a 7 in. square nesting box, hung some 7 feet from
ground level.
We had every reason to believe that they were in earnest, but
time went on and nothing seemed to happen. In the meanwhile,
the Gouldians became serious and ousted the Parrot Finches from
their box. The Gouldians lost no time in building a beautiful dome-
shaped nest in the same box, and soon were sitting very closely.
After sitting for about three weeks, my wife reported that they had
suddenly given it up. As I was ill in bed at the time and unable to
assist, it was arranged that she should make certain whether or not
the Gouldians sat on the nest at night. After satisfying herself on this
point, next morning she removed the box and on examining the
nest found one infertile Gouldian egg. Surprised to find that they
had made their nest so high up in the box, my wife grew suspicious
that something might be wrong. Thereupon she dug still further
down into the nest and was amazed to find two eggs with chicks

dead in the shell, and two well-developed young Parrot Finches,
both dead. The quills had already commenced to burst open.
Apparently the Gouldians had built their nest on top of the living
young Parrot Finches and eggs, and all the fuss was over one
infertile egg. There were many more nest-boxes dotted about the
aviary, and lots of natural bushes, which makes their behaviour all
the more difficult to understand. Needless to say, the Gouldians
were promptly removed from the aviary.
The Parrot Finches went to nest again, but misfortune seemed to
dog the hen as she was picked up dead early one morning, having
succumbed to egg binding during a cold night ; so disappeared what
we considered all hopes of ever breeding Blue-faced Parrot Finches.
However, good fortune smiled on us once more, and it was during
the 1937-8 breeding season that we met with the success which my
wife had so much longed for.
A pair was sent to her from England, and fortunately on this
occasion they arrived during the lovely warm weather of summer,
which is a great advantage to new arrivals. After the usual three to
four weeks' period of quarantine, they were liberated into a breeding
aviary, which they had all to themselves. The aviary was well
supplied with natural bushes, also a liberal supply of nesting-boxes
and tins. Almost immediately they settled down. The cock was
seen carrying straws, and for more than a fortnight we never caught
sight of the hen. My wife, by this time, had become anxious
and worried. Watching often and very closely without success, she
was sorely tempted to make still closer investigation between bush
and box, even going so far as to remove a suspected nesting-box for
inspection, to see whether the hen was dead or alive. Afraid of
interfering with the privacy of the birds, she wisely decided to
trust to her nose and ears, since all else had failed.
The more cherished thought and hopes, of course, were that we
would hear the sound of young voices crying for food, but these hopes
we dared not even think about. They were secret thoughts.
Thoughts we held entirely to ourselves, which were not disclosed to
each other until long afterwards.
Some weeks had passed by now, and still there were no signs of
the hen, dead or alive. Nor was there any other evidence, for which
we were at all times prepared whatever it might be. There was no
bad odour forthcoming, but at the same time, none of our secretly

cherished hopes of young voices were heard. Suddenly the cock
bird started gorging on live food, in the form of termites.
Although these birds were nervous and terribly wild when first
put into the aviary, the cock afterwards became so tame that as
soon as he caught sight of my wife, through the glass window of the
aviary house early in the morning, he would hop down to the shelf
and literally tell her that he was waiting for termites. Afterwards
he became so tame and bold that with one or two chirps as though
to say " I'm coming 35 he would land on the glass paste-pot full of
termites In her hand, as she was placing it Into the centre of a
dish of water on the shelf. This is the method we use to keep the
Argentine Ants out of the termite pots. After filling himself on live
food, he would Immediately fly to the nest. This was the first
bright spark of hope, and no surer sign that there were young in the
nest. A few days after, to the delight of my wife, she excitedly
reported having heard the faint voices of youngsters. Day by day
the voices grew louder and louder, until on 19th October, 1937,
our first baby Blue-face left the nest. On 21st October my wife
proudly introduced me to four bonny youngsters, sitting together on
the perch. They were all fine, strong, sturdy chaps, full of life and
vigour. They were the usual dark green colour, with very con-
spicuous, luminous blue beads on each side of and at the base of
their bright yellow beaks. Gradually the pretty blue beads
disappeared and were completely gone in about six weeks. In the
meanwhile the beak was changing from yellow to shiny black. The
blue slowly commenced to appear on the face, the maroon tail
became more rich in colour, and in due course they were a very
pretty adult quartet.
What nervous, frightened young birds they were At the first
glimpse of anybody approaching the aviary house they would fly
straight for the light, and strike the wire with terrific force. It was
painful to see them dashing about, and made one reluctant to go
near. However, after a week or two they seemed to become more
sensible, and took cover in the bushes at the first sound of anyone
approaching. In all there were four clutches of eggs, made up of
four, three, three, and four. Fourteen chicks were hatched out
during the one season, but only twelve were reared to full maturity.
As a result of this success, several friends have benefited, and

South Africa, from Claremont to Johannesburg. At this stage we
agreed that they had bred sufficient for one season. We also
thought that after rearing twelve youngsters in the same nest, the
box must be in a very filthy condition, so we decided to remove
the box.
In this we were greatly mistaken, firstly because the box we
removed was empty, and not the one we made so sure they had
nested in, and secondly when we did discover the right box we were
astounded to find that the nest was spotlessly clean. Despite the
fact that there was plenty of natural bushes available, attractively
arranged, they chose a box about 7 inches square, tucked away in
a dark corner of the house, behind the bushes some 7 feet from the
ground. A very ordinary saucer-shaped nest was made, consisting
of a few green straws on the bottom of the box, suggesting that
nesting material was very scarce. The only reason we can give for
such an improvised nest is that, in the circumstances, they were in a
desperate hurry and did not have sufficient time when the original
nest was built, so never bothered to add any new furniture to the
home during later breeding operations.
During the breeding period they were certainly not in good
plumage, in fact I've never seen a pair look so ragged, the hen was
perfectly moth-eaten. The fact that she did all the incubating may
also have something to do with the appearance of her plumage.
The cock seemed to spend most of his time on a near-by perch,
apparently on the watch, ready to sound the alarm and carry live
food to the nest.
About three and a half weeks passed before the hen showed
herself. She was extremely nervous and took cover immediately she
caught sight of anyone.
The aviary was heated during the cold winter months, and is
now stocked with Hartlaubs, Green Twin-spotted Waxbills,
Gouldians, Green Avadavats, Masked Finches, and the Parrot
Finches. After winter, all the bushes, boxes, etc., were taken out,
the aviary burned out with a blow-lamp, whitewashed, and then
restocked with bush and box. Despite all these changes and
additions, it seems to have made no difference to this faithful pair.
They started off this 1938-9 season exactly the same time as last,
and up to date there are already 14 fine, strong youngsters on
the perches, 4 from the first clutch, 4 from the second, 3 from the

third, and 3 from the fourth. This makes a total of 28 youngsters
from one pair, of which 26 were reared to full maturity.
On this occasion they changed the site for their residence, and
chose a similar box, in full view of everybody. This season they
appear to have had more time to think matters out, and a beautiful
deep, dome-shaped nest was built.
It has been most interesting and amusing to watch the young-
sters, in the latter stages of their dormitory period, climbing on
top of each other's backs, each trying to get a peep at the outside
world through the entrance. This went on, much to the amusement
of the family, until on the 19th October, exactly the same date as
last year, the first youngster left the nest, followed soon after by the
remaining three. They have been a great source of pleasure to us
all. Now they are busy building again.

Two pairs of this species, commonly called the Palawan Peacock
Pheasant, have been kept at Leckford for two or three years.
Until last Sunday no one had seen either of the cocks display.
The bird is greyish-brown with a white face. The extent of
this white seems to vary a good deal. The crest resembles that of the
Burmese Peacock. The feathers, that compose it, stand up pretty
tightly together in a fairly long tuft and this points rather forward
over the bill.
I have never seen a skin of Schleiermacher's Peacock Pheasant,
but I understand that the Napoleon is the most highly coloured of
the genus.
On this background of greyish-brown with a little white there
is a gorgeous decoration of metallic green. This colour is placed
on the wings and tail. On the wings it is in several long bars which,
to my eye at all events, look rather as if they had been painted
upon the bird without attention to the individual feathers. On

the tail it is in numerous, large round spots. Speaking from
memory I think that on the wings the green has a bluish gloss but
that there is less, if any, of this on the spots on the tail.
It is obvious that in the display the wings and tail must be
spread but there is nothing in the build of the bird to indicate
that the tail would not be spread like the false tail of a Peacock,
that is to say at right angles to the body.
On the nth June one of our two cocks suddenly displayed
repeatedly to his hen while I was standing with two strangers
at the door of the shed in which both sexes spend much of the day,
though there is good cover in their run.
At Leckford we take a good deal of trouble to get our Pheasants
tame. A good many of the Tragopans will feed from hand. Many
other species will not merely come right up to visitors, including
strangers, but will stay there as long as bits of pea-nut are dropped
for them.
Neither of our Palawans has become as tame as this and the
cock, of which I am speaking now, has been decidedly the shyer of
the two. He would not show definite alarm, as all of our Bulwers
still do, but he would not come at all close and, unless pea-nuts
were thrown from a distance and at the right time, he would
generally, if out in the run, get behind the shed or hide otherwise.
On this occasion he showed no shyness at all. As soon as we
came to the open door of the shed and I saw that the birds were
inside, I threw in a nut hoping that they would begin to feed
instead of leaving the shed by the little chicken-door at its other
end.
Either this small excitement in a general way or possibly the
hen's moving towards the nut seemed to excite the cock at once.
He immediately drew himself up and, as it were, hunched his
shoulders like a barn-door cock about to crow. The pose was not
extreme but it was definite. He then spread a little the feathers of
the tail that are normally carried closely together so as to form a
straight mass on which few of the eye-spots can be seen.
He then suddenly spread both wings and the tail and twisted
the upper face of the wings and tail so that they formed a single
flat surface, absolutely at right angles, so far as I could judge, to the
ground.

displayed several times so that on at least three occasions we got
the view intended for the hen and at other times we got both the
view from the other side, where there is no colour at all, and also
the view from straight behind the bird. One saw then how com-
pletely the two wings and the tail are twisted so as to be
perpendicular to the ground.
When thus spread, the tail is so circular as to form with the
wings a general impression, that to my own eye was almost comic,
of forming an exact circle. The bird looks like a circular plate
standing edgewise to the ground and lifted by an invisible stand
an inch or two into the air.
The head was pointed downwards, though less extremely so
than in, for example, Rheinhardt's Argus. The crest seemed quite
unaffected but its normal angle to the head emphasized the way
in which the head was bent downward and markedly, though
not extremely, sideways towards the hen.
At the height of the display the cock gave a rather prolonged
cry like a small groan. The sound was rather more poignant than
the noise that a human being may make in an extreme yawn
but not so much so as to be at all eerie or distressing.

More than a hundred members of the Society accepted the kind invitation
of Mr. and Mrs. Ezra to a Garden Party at Foxwarren Park on the 27th May,
when they were favoured with perfect weather. The majority travelled from Town
in a charabanc, most generously chartered for the occasion by Mr. Ezra, others
arriving in private cars.
Foxwarren Park is certainly one of the most lovely spots in Surrey, and at this
time of year, the garden and surrounding country is in perfection, and when one
adds to its natural loveliness the sight of the finest private collection of living birds
in the country if not in the world, one realizes that here is a spot entirely unique.
The Aviary
On the arrival of the guests in the early afternoon, a move was made towards
the aviaries. These consist of ranges of well-equipped shelters, each with its outer
flight, these flights leading into much larger flights, planted with growing shrubs.
The collection is a wonderful one, containing many of the rarest foreign birds
that have ever been imported to Europe. Many were nesting, and we noted a
sitting Blacksmith Plover. Rows of smaller aviaries contain single pairs of such
birds as Kookaburras, Mynahs, and others, while behind the main aviaries are
long ranges of very good Parrot and Parrakeet Aviaries.

Parrots Breeding

<bodyText confidence="0.969366285714286" page_id="56322864"  page_num="236" year="" vol="">
Here we noticed a splendid pair of Guildings Parrots (Amazona guildingii),
which were incubating eggs, a most noteworthy event. A pair of Leadbeaters
Cockatoos had three young ones in the nest, while another nest contained a fine
young blue Alexandrine Parrakeet. The yellow variety of the Indian Ring-necked
Parrakeet is becoming quite well established in the Foxwarren aviaries, and this
year there are a number of yellows bred from yellow-bred birds. Crimson-wings
and Malabars also had young.
Weavers at Liberty
In the shrubbery outside the aviary we heard the chattering song of Weaver-
birds, and Mr. Ezra tells us he has liberated a number of yellow Weavers which have
settled down well and are busy building nests.
Cranes
The Crane Paddocks, which were visited next, contain a grand lot of birds,
including a pair of the very rare Wattled Crane from South Africa. Two pairs of
Stanley and a pair of Manchurian Cranes were nesting, while a pair of White-
necks had two very healthy chicks.
The Bird Room
In the Bird Room, to which the party then wended their way, are very many
gems of all kinds, some being the only ones of their species ever imported. Some
time was spent here, and then a move was made to the house, where Mrs. Ezra
and her daughters entertained the party to a sumptuous tea.

<bodyText confidence="0.986237192307692" page_id="56322864"  page_num="236" year="" vol="">
After tea, Mr. Ezra conducted his guests to the park, which is full of delights
for the naturalist. Bennett's Wallabies were here in numbers, many with Joeys
in their pouches, and in the distance a large herd of Indian Blackbuck, two of
which, having been hand-reared, preferred the company of the visitors to that
of their own kind, and became almost embarrassing in their attentions.
The birds here consist mostly of Cranes and Waterfowl, many of the former
being full-winged. The sight of a pair of enormous Sarus Cranes on the wing is
one to be remembered.
Waterfowl
The Duck ponds contain a very choice collection, including Barrow's Golden-
eye, Indian Cotton Teal, Tree Ducks and many others ; and numbers were
nesting. Full-winged Mandarins and Carolinas nest freely in boxes placed in
trees, and already quite a number had hatched and taken their broods to the
water.
Foreign Geese roam the Park, and three species at least, namely Bar-headed,
Hutchins', and Ross's Snow Geese were sitting ; while in a paddock a pair of
Ashy-headed Geese had two healthy goslings.
Mr. C. S. Webb
There is always great excitement amongst keen aviculturists when Mr. Webb
returns home from one of his expeditions, because he always brings a number of
birds that are new to aviculture, and on his arrival from the Central Province of
Tanganyika at the end of May, they were not disappointed.
The birds of Tanganyika are not well known to aviculture, but most of them
are races of the better known species from West Africa. Some thirty species were
represented in the collection, the majority being new to aviculture as sub-species,
.and several as distinct species.

A COLLECTOR IN THE ANDES OF ECUADOR
By C. S. Webb
In the winter of 1937-8 I went to Ecuador with my niece in
search of some of the delightful birds confined to the Andes, which
rarely find their way to aviculturists in Europe. I believe that,
prior to my visit, Walter Goodfellow was the only Englishman to
go to Ecuador to make a collection of live birds from the Andean
region, and that was in 1914. Some of the older members of the
Avicultural Society may remember seeing, or reading of, his
wonderful collection, containing mostly specimens that were quite
new to England.
Away from the towns and railways travelling conditions have
not changed very much in Ecuador and to get to any of the forested
regions of the western or eastern Andes it is still necessary to go on
foot or by horse along the same old narrow trails that have been in
use for generations. In these days one can at least reach Ecuador
in comfort and if one chooses a line that includes many ports of
call the voyage is most interesting. Besides the West Indies our
boat called at the lovely harbour of La Guayra with its impressive
background of high mountains. This is the port for Caracas, the
capital of Venezuela, which is well-known to aviculturists on
account of its famous bird-market. It is about twenty-three miles
from La Guayra, situated at an altitude of 3,000 feet, and can be
reached by car in a little over an hour. When I visited the market
there were a number of the more common Tanagers on offer,
including the Black-throated (Euphonia nigricollis ), the Violet

Tanager (E. violacea), the Yellow-headed Hangnest ( Icterus
chrysocephalus) , a Black Cassique ( Cassidix oryzivora ), and a few
Salvadori's Sugar-birds ( Coereba mexicana intermedia). There were
also a few Humming-birds which looked rather sorry for themselves
as they were being fed on sugared water only.
From Puerto Colombia we made the journey to Barranguilla,
a few miles inland, where there were a few birds for sale in the
shops, including Yellow-winged Sugar-birds which looked remark-
ably well, and also some Military Starlings and Violet Tanagers.
After calling at the Dutch island of Curacao and passing through
the Panama Canal we called at Buenaventura on the Pacific coast
of Colombia. Here I saw quite a number of privately owned birds
and, besides some common Amazons, there was a lovely Lesson's
Parrot {A. lilacina), several Red and Blue Macaws ( Ara chloroptera ),
and a fine Yellow-backed Cassique (Cassidus persicus).
About 800 miles south of Panama, Guayaquil, the principal
port of Ecuador, was reached and here we disembarked to make
the journey to Quito the capital. The line for the first fifty miles
traverses the flat coastal belt and then winds its way up the western
slopes of the Andes to a height of 12,000 feet, after which it descends
to the plateau in which Quito is situated at 9,500 feet, and about
300 miles from Guayaquil. Ecuador is one of the smallest and
least known of the South American Republics, but it is the richest
in bird life, due to the remarkable diversity in climatic conditions
and vegetation.
The Andes traverse Ecuador from north to south, leaving only
a narrow strip of flat country between them and the Pacific, and
every kind of climate exists from desert, tropical (humid), sub-
tropical (humid and dry), temperate (humid and dry), to the
alpine regions of the great mountains which are perpetually covered
with snow. In this respect Ecuador can boast of the fact that it
has snow on the equator.
This extraordinary variety of climate with its corresponding
types of vegetation make this part of the New World the most
prolific in bird life, and its inaccessibility to the ordinary traveller
rather adds to excitement of exploring the numerous mountains
and valleys where bird life is extremely local.
The Andes on account of their great height create a natural
division in the animal life, and so we find about 400 species and

sub-species of birds in eastern Ecuador that are not found on the
western side, and nearly 200 in the west that do not occur in the
east.
The very size of some of the families is sufficient to indicate a
number of distinct zones and there are, for instance, 132 species
and 16 sub-species of Humming-birds ; but this enormous
total is beaten by the Tyrants [Tyrannidae ), which number 142
species and 18 sub-species. Altogether there are 1,357 species
and 151 sub-species of birds in Ecuador in an area less than that
of Germany.
We decided, first of all, to visit a small village called Santo
Domingo de los Colorados at the foot of the western Andes, which
is famous for its Indians and also rich in bird-life--being in the
humid tropical zone. We were able to go about eighty miles by
car from Quito, but then we had to resort to mules for three days,
which provided a severe contrast in speed and comfort. Not having
done any riding for a couple of years I found the wooden saddle
anything but comfortable, especially as we had to ride for thirteen
hours a day on the first two days.
Being the rainy season it was pouring down nearly all the way
and the narrow trail was in a terrible state. It was very rocky in
some parts, and in others so boggy that the mules sank to their
bellies in the mud. One seemed to be completely hemmed in by
mountains all the time, but the trail winds its way through the
valleys, following the river on its tortuous course to the open
plains. Waterfalls hundreds of feet high were a frequent sight and
at short intervals streams were rushing wildly from the mountains
into the river. Often these streams tore their way through deep
gorges which were spanned by rudely made narrow bridges
consisting of a few poles laid horizontally across and covered with
earth. In some cases they were made of bamboo and in the heavy
rains it is not an uncommon thing for the earth to get washed
through the crevices between the poles so that the mules' feet
sometimes go clean through the bridge. My niece had a hair-
breadth escape crossing one of these gorges on a bridge that was
only three feet wide, with no sides, when her mule put its foot in
a hole and fell flat on its stomach ; as it struggled wildly to regain
its feet it seemed inevitable that it must go over the side into the
raging torrent below. Fortunately it righted itself safely and it was

lucky too, that my niece managed somehow to keep on the mule's
back, otherwise it would have been a disastrous affair.
The grandeur of the scenery surpassed anything that I had seen
in the Himalayas previously, and acted as some compensation for
the rough going and for the discomfort of being wet through to
the skin. We were so late one day in reaching a hut along the
trail where we intended staying the night that it was pitch dark
before we reached our destination, so we just had to rely on the senses
of our mules to guide us to safety. It was rather an awesome
business crossing the narrow bamboo bridges without being able
to see anything, and with the sound of water rushing far below.
Our pack-mules were laden with provisions, blankets, and bird-
cages, and the transportation of the latter along the narrow forested
trails was a problem owing to the mules constantly trying to pass
one another, with the result that the loads jutting out from their
sides were subjected to heavy crashes The same thing happened
when a mule passed too near to a tree. Also it was not uncommon
for them to fall over when sliding down the sides of slippery boulders
or when wading torrents studded with large rocks and holes.
Santo Domingo is noted for its nearly extinct tribe of Indians,
who plaster their bodies all over, and even their hair, with a bright
red paste made from the seeds of the achote tree. They are very
shy and only a few speak broken Spanish, so conversing with them is
difficult. They are a fine race physically and morally, but these
attributes as well as their very existence are jeopardized through
contact with the Ecuadorian degenerates now living in their midst.
Unfortunately it rained hard every day that I was at Santo
Domingo and the surrounding country was reduced to a bog,
otherwise I might have received some assistance from the local
Indians.
I was particularly keen on getting a live specimen of the
Umbrella Bird (Cephalopterus penduliger) known locally as the
Pajaro toro (Bull bird) on account of its bellowing call-notes.
This bird is one of the curiosities of the animal kingdom with its
" bushy " crest and feathered wattle, over a foot long, hanging
down from the neck. An Indian hunter told me that this appendage
is inflated when the bird is calling.
In the plantations and second growth Tanagers were plentiful,
especially the Yellow-backed Tanager (Ramphocelus icteronotus) and

the migrant Scarlet Tanager ( Piranga rubra). The males of the former
were the most conspicuous birds of the region, and in flight looked
very handsome with their yellow backs contrasting with the velvety
black of the rest of the plumage.
In spite of the rain and mud I managed to trap a number of
interesting specimens by setting nets in the trees, though this was
rendered somewhat hazardous by the wet and slippery nature of
the branches. Two of the nicest birds that I got at Santo Domingo
were a pair of Coroneted Manakins ( Masius coronulatus) , which
looked like very diminutive Cocks-of-the-Rock. The most hand-
some Tanagers were a pair of greenish-blue Tanagers ( Tangara
labradoroides ).
I saw, on rare occasions, a rather pretty bird, Arremon auran-
tiirostris occidentalism which had an orange bill and black and white
striped head. It is closely related to the Saltators, but does not
appear to have a satisfactory English name. I believe that it was
referred to formerly as the Orange-billed Tanager, but is now
classed as a Pectoral Sparrow. I only managed to secure one,
which was quite a handsome bird and not a bit Sparrow-like in its
habits. A very distinct Tanager and one of the most beautiful--
the Western Swallow Fruit-eater ( Tersina viridis occidentalis) --was
occasionally seen in the clearings where berries were plentiful.
It has a wide gape like that of a Gotinga, and the males are a
shining turquoise-blue with the forehead, throat, and sides of the
face black. The female is quite unlike the male but is nevertheless
very beautiful with brilliant green plumage.
A pair of Sclater's Orange-headed Tanagers ( Tangara lunigera)
was also obtained. They are very striking, with their orange plumage
contrasting with a black face, wings, and tail.
Many other attractive birds were seen in the forest around
Santo Domingo including several Barbets. The New World Barbets
are not well known over here, but some that I saw were exceedingly
handsome, especially the Bourcier's Barbet ( Eubucco bourcieri
aequatorialis) , which is a gorgeous bird with a mixture of green,
scarlet, silvery white, and yellow in its plumage. Swainson's
Toucans ( Ramphastos swainsoni) were also seen, and we were
fortunate in obtaining a pair of young ones which were ridiculously
tame and made most amusing pets. They are rare in captivity.

which we were living made us give a sigh of relief when we set off
again on our mules for Quito. The return journey was even worse
than the outward one as the heavy rain was continuous and we
had to climb over 8,000 feet.
Not being able to obtain any porters, our bird cages had to be
strapped to the mules and the journey was rather a nightmare,
with the animals frequently falling into mud-holes and crashing
into trees. All the birds survived the first two days, but the last
one was too much for some of them. I never attempted to carry
birds again by mules, and wherever I went I took porters with me.
Our next trip was to Lloa, a small Spanish village to the south-
west of Mount Pichincha, situated at an elevation of 11,000 feet.
While we were searching the surrounding country for some sort
of a hut to stay in and use as our headquarters while collecting,
we were offered the use of the local school, as there was no other
accommodation available in the village. Fortunately the children
were on holiday, though this did not mean that we were without
company. Ecuador is noted for its fleas, but I never experienced
anything like the massed attack by the inmates of that school-
room. Luckily we didn't have to put up with that ordeal for long
as we got the loan of a charcoal-burner's hut about 500 feet above
Lloa on a steep hill overlooking the valley and facing Mount
Pichincha.
At 11,500 feet we were in the temperate zone and the country-
side was frequently enveloped in cold mist. The nights were
particularly cold and anything less like the tropical conditions
usually met with on the equator it would be difficult to imagine.
In this region Humming-birds were particularly plentiful and
it was an extraordinary sight to look out of the hut at daybreak
when one's limbs were stiff with cold to see numbers of the fragile-
looking Thornbill Humming-birds (Ramphomicrom microrynchum)
flitting round the flowers through the cold grey mist in the most
animated manner. Other Humming-birds common at this altitude
were Bouquet's Puff-legs ( Vesiiped.es luciani ), and a charming sight
they were with their white " powder-puffs " displayed pro-
minently on the legs. It is a common belief that Humming-birds
are attracted only to red flowers, but in this region nearly all the
different species were feeding on white blossoms.
After much searching I came across a Sword-billed Humming-

bird (Ensifera ensifera), a bird which I was particularly anxious to
capture owing to its very unusual proportions. The beak is con-
siderably longer than the body and it feeds almost entirely on the
trumpet-shaped flowers of the scarlet brugmansia. These blooms
are about the same length or a little longer than the bird's beak and
it seems that the Sword-bill has evolved a bill (and tongue)
sufficiently long to enable it to feed quite easily from its favourite
food plant. During six weeks of strenuous mountaineering
I captured five of these rare birds, but was unable to find a suitable
artificial diet for their sustenance. The usual proprietary infants'
food mixed with condensed milk and honey or glucose, such as is
a recognized diet for Humming-birds in general, acted just like a
poison to these specialized feeders and after having a good feed
they would roll over dead. The last one I kept for three weeks by
completely changing the diet and I was hopeful of solving the
problem, but by that time the Sword-bills had completely dis-
appeared as the brugmansias had finished flowering. Evidently
they had gone to another district where, owing to different climatic
conditions, these bushes were later in blooming. By changing
about it seems that they can find their favourite food nearlv all the
year round. There is evidently something different about the
nectar of the brugmansia flowers for I never experienced any
difficulty with artificial food for any other Humming-birds.
The beautiful Scarlet-bellied Tanagers (.Poscilothraupis lunulata)
live in the wooded temperate zone and I caught several above
Lloa. They are happier in the virgin forests where there is an
unlimited supply of food, but the western Andes anywhere near
Quito offer no such abode in these times. For miles and miles
every tree has been chopped down for firewood or charcoal, and
all that remains is bushy second growth. It is difficult to find a
tree of sufficient growth and strength to bear one's weight, so that
setting nets in between the branches is almost an impossibility.
But fortunately the forest of the eastern Andes remains untouched
and so between 11,000 and 12,000 feet Scarlet-bellied Tanagers
are abundant.
To return to Lloa, another Tanager living at the same altitude
but with entirely different habits was the Chestnut-capped
Tanager (Buarremon spodionotus ). It was not uncommon but always
kept near the ground in low bushes, and was rather skulking in its

<bodyText confidence="0.998957128205128" page_id="56322880"  page_num="244" year="" vol="">
habits. In captivity they become quite tame and although not so
showy as some of the other high mountain Tanagers are nevertheless
very attractive.
The commonest birds on the hillsides above Lloa were-
Guit-guits {Diglossa )--a genus closely related to the Sugar-birds,
but with dull blackish plumage. Wherever I set nets I was sure to
catch numbers of these birds, but not being of particular interest
I liberated them all.
There were two kinds of very beautiful Ant-thrushes around
south-west Pichincha, the Chestnut-crowned {Grailaria ruficapilla)
and the Undulated Ant-thrush (G. squamigera). The former has a
chestnut head and white under-parts striped with chestnut-brown
and the latter is brown with yellowish fulvous under-parts crossed
by numerous black undulations. They love to frequent the damp
ditches dug along the sides of fields, which have a thick overhanging
vegetation. In such places they can run along unhampered and
unseen, and capture a plentiful supply of earthworms which are
their principal food. The Grallarias or Ant-thrushes have short
tails, long legs, and plump bodies, and they look very quaint as
they hop about looking for food. Towards evening they may be
seen perched on a stump or fallen tree uttering their rather
monotonous call-notes. If disturbed they make for cover--always
on the ground, either under some thick bushes or in a well-covered
ditch. In captivity they show plenty of intelligence and are most
amusing. To transport them to England I kept a plentiful supply
of moss on the bottom of their cages and a stump of soft wood for
them to stand on. These simple precautions prevented any foot-
trouble which would have occurred if the birds were compelled to
stand or hard perches on floors all the time.
Owing to the proximity of Quito to Mount Pichincha and
to the growth of this city in recent years, most of the Tanagers
described by Mr. Goodfellow as being found on the wooded slopes
of the mountain are now almost non-existent in that area, owing
to the destruction of the tree-life.
In an attempt to find a region untampered by man I made the
journey to Papallacta--an Indian village situated at 11,500 feet
in the eastern Andes. Leaving my collection of birds in charge of
my niece in Quito I set off with a blow-gun expert, a muleteer,
and some pack-mules.

Crossing the Tumbaco valley at about 8,500 feet I got my
first glimpse of the Giant Humming-bird ( Patagona gigas ) which
looked quite enormous on the wing. What it has in bulk it lacks in
beauty for it is one of the dullest, although the largest of the
Trochilidae. Having crossed this wide valley we started the long
climb up to the Guamani Pass (14,500 feet) ; as we proceeded by
easy stages it became colder and colder until I felt that I could
no longer sit on a mule's back, so I tried walking for a change.
I soon discovered that walking up a stiff incline at 14,000 feet, in
competition with mules that were used to high altitudes, was no
joke and in a few minutes I was gasping for breath. This was more
unpleasant than being half-frozen so I quickly resumed my seat.
In this treeless alpine zone, known as the " paramo " there was
precious little bird life--the only two living things that I saw being
a Black-rumped Ground-Tyrant ( Muscisaxicola alpina) and a Red-
rumped Ground-Tyrant ( Cremarchus erythropygius) . As I sat almost
frozen to the saddle I marvelled to think that even higher in the
mountains lived a Humming-bird, the Hill Star ( Oreotrochilus ) and
that it should choose such a bleak zone to live in permanently,
rather than descend to the warmth of the lower levels.
Having reached the highest point of the pass we crossed a sort
of no-man's-land with some of the wildest scenery imaginable.
It was quite thrilling to think that I was passing over one of nature's
greatest barriers and that I would soon be in a very different floral
and faunal zone. The excitement grew when I saw a few small
streams running eastwards instead of to the west. These quickly
became torrents rushing wildly down, and I thought of their long
course to the headwaters of the Amazon and then thousands of
miles through Brazil to the Atlantic, whereas the rivers of the
Western Andes have a very short course to the Pacific coast.
As we were leaving the paramo and passing into the forest
zone the first bird I saw was a Scarlet-bellied Tanager which
must have been at 13,000 feet, then came some Humming-birds
and more Tanagers. At 12,500 feet we passed the dark cold-looking
waters of Lake Papallacta where I saw a few Andean Teal ( Nettium
andium). We then descended to Papallacta--a village surrounded
by mountains dominated by the picturesque and mighty Mount
Antisana (over 20,000 feet). Papallacta is one of the most beautiful
places I have seen, but the climate, although warm in the daytime,

was incredibly cold at night. I was fortunate in being able to stay
in the substantial residence of the local " Jefe Politico " which was,
far more comfortable than any of the Indians' huts. The latter
were very picturesque with their long thatched roofs reaching
almost to the ground, but the insides were dark, and wonderful
breeding-places for vermin.
My blow-gun man very soon came in with an assortment of
marvellous Humming-birds, including a Temminck's Sapphire-
wing (Pterophanes temmincki), which reminded one of an enormous
butterfly, with its shining deep-blue wings and silent flight. The
body was metallic green and the total length 6f in. Another species
of Humming-bird, the Shining Sunbeam (Agleactis cupripennis ) was
very common around Papallacta and was interesting to me because
of the irridescent plumage, showing only when viewed from behind.
Normally the back is a velvety blackish brown but viewed from
behind it lights up into purplish crimson, with a coppery hue on
the lower back and metallic green on the rump.
One of the most gorgeous species--the Comte de Paris
Humming-bird (Helianthea lutetiae) was locally common, and it
had an affinity for some crimson tubular flowers with yellow tips.
These grew in great clusters but only in a few spots and it was here
that I found the Comtes de Paris plentiful but elsewhere none were
to be seen. The colouring of these birds was rather extraordinary,
the head being velvety black, the forehead metallic green, the
under-parts shining green with a metallic blue throat, the
secondaries buff making a conspicuous patch in the wing, and the
upper-parts brownish-black glossed with green. They are medium-
sized birds with long straight bills and in captivity they seem to have
a constant fear of one another. When I had several together in
a large cage they were too busy watching every movement to
seize an occasion to take a few sips of nectar from one of the feeding-
bottles. I never once saw anything in the nature of an attack, but
they all seemed to live in constant anticipation of one, and it was
only necessary for one bird to hover to cause the rest to dive into
corners on the floor, with their hearts beating rapidly as if the
enemy were about to drop bombs. They were so stupid in this
respect that I was forced to cage them singly.
Scarlet-bellied Tanagers were common here and I was able to
capture all I wanted by setting nets in the trees where they fed.

I occasionally saw a few Orange-bellied Tanagers ( Poecilothraupis
palpebrosa )--a species very similar in size and appearance to the
foregoing, but with the scarlet parts orange. Another most striking
Tanager that I saw near Papallacta was Vassor's Tanager ( Procnopsis
vassori) ; I saw a small flock of these one day at close quarters,
and the brilliance of their shining silky blue plumage was almost
startling.
The return journey to Quito was by no means a picnic as the
birds had to be carried by porters. Grossing the paramo we
were subjected to a fierce freezing wind and so the cages had to
be wrapped up tightly in sacks. It was a relief to descend to the
warmer levels again both for our own comfort and the safety of
the birds.
Around Quito the ubiquitous eucalyptus tree is very much in
evidence and these are a great attraction to Humming-birds,
especially the Violet-ear ( Petasophora iolata ) and the Trainbearer
(.Psalidoprymna victoriae aequatorialis) . This was another instance
of Humming-birds feeding on white flowers. In many of the gardens
in Quito Violet-ears and Trainbearers can be seen flitting about all
day long, the latter being particularly thrilling to watch as they
dart through the air like arrows.
It is remarkable how most of the Andean Humming-birds
remain at certain altitudes, in some cases within narrow limits.
It would be difficult to say if this is brought about by the influence
of climate, or vegetation, or both. Nearly all the mountain
Humming-birds have favourite food-plants, but the plant-life is
influenced by the different climatic conditions. Who can say, for
instance, whether the Hill Star which lives at 13,000 to 14,000 feet
confines itself to such a frigid zone on account of the climate or its
favourite food-plant, which only grows at such altitudes ?
The Hill Star Humming-birds are among the wonders of the
bird world, for it is amazing that such small creatures which rely
mainly on nectar for their sustenance should choose the cold wind-
swept paramo region of Mount Pichincha and Mount Chim-
borazo. On the latter mountain Hill Stars are found within
500 feet of the snow-line. So isolated are these birds in their alpine
retreats that the two mountains, although quite close to one another,
have produced two distinct races. The capture of both these alive
was a very uncomfortable and laborious business and the expense

entailed was out of all proportion to the prizes gained. Strange to
say these birds were not affected in the slightest by the tropical
heat when taken down to the coast.
Our last trip was to Chiriboga on the River Saloya. This was
on the western slopes of the Andes, at 5,000 feet, in a region thickly
forested and very precipitous--in fact too precipitous to be an
ideal collecting ground. A road has been newly constructed
following the course of the Rio Saloya, from where it will eventually
be extended to Santo Domingo. This is a sporting course in the
rainy season, for the road, being cut out of loose earth on the
precipitous slopes rising from the river, is apt to give way under
the weight of a car. This actually happened only three days before
we went along there and the car and its occupants came to rest
1,000 feet below. Normally the roots of trees, bushes, and grasses
hold the soil together but once the vegetation has been cleared the
torrential rains get the upper hand.
The main idea of coming to this part was to make an effort to
capture the Red Cock-of-the-Rock (Rupicola sanguinolenta ). This
magnificent bird even outclasses in splendour its eastern relative
(.Rupicola rupicola ), which is well-known in captivity. The former
has blood-red plumage, with the wings and tail black and the
secondaries silvery grey. The crest is also much broader than that
of its relative.
On this occasion we took all our birds with us and, having gone
as far as we could by lorry, we proceeded on foot with fifteen porters
along a narrow path through dense jungle. The going was bad for
the path was blocked with the stumps of fallen trees, and swamps
and slippery rocks were met with alternately and numerous small
rapids had to be forded. Finally after marching for six
hours we had to cross the Rio Saloya. This, like all the mountain
rivers, is just a raging torrent especially in the rainy season. The
only " bridge " was a long slimy tree trunk stretching from the
bank to a pile of stranded drift-wood in the middle of the river,
and another long trunk from there to the opposite bank. We
managed to get all the birds over safely but some of our stores, which
were left behind owing to an insufficiency of porters, remained on
the wrong side of the river for a week. The reason for this was that
our crossing of the river coincided with the commencement of a
terrific storm and owing to the mountainous nature of the country

the river rose rapidly, and with a roar we saw our " bridge 55 and
its supporting pile of tree trunks washed away in the mad torrent.
While another " bridge 55 was being constructed our sole diet
consisted of rice and potatoes. We commenced by capturing
several Blue Sylph Humming-birds ( Cyanolesbia coelestis ), one of the
most beautiful of the whole family, and conspicuous chiefly on
account of its long blue graduated tail-feathers with metallic
edgings. They are extremely temperamental and while they are
becoming used to captivity they behave more or less like sulky
school children. Sometimes they feign death, and while doing so
they will occasionally open one eye to see if anyone is about.
If they think all is clear they get up and fly round in the normal
manner but if someone is in view the eye is closed immediately and
the " dying 55 position is resumed. They are also very " finnicky 55
about their food and once they have become accustomed to feeding
out of a particular type of vessel, nothing will induce them to feed
from any other. This is very curious for they will get as far as
tasting the fluid, but the fact that it is not in the familiar pot seems
to put them completely against having any more, and they will
die of starvation rather than give in. I was thankful that all
Humming-birds were not such a trial as these though, generally
speaking, the mountain species are much more difficult to establish
than those of the low country. Other beautiful Humming-birds
that we added to the collection in this region were the White-
booted Racket-tail ( Ocreatus underwoodi melanantherus )--a very
diminutive species--and the Hill Angel (. Heliangelus viola) ; we also
captured a pair of the very quaint-looking Toucan-like Barbets,
which are rare and rather local.
Unfortunately heavy rain continued to fall and we had great
difficulty in reaching the region where it was known that the
Cocks-of-the-Rock resided. In the dry season they can be found
in numbers in certain spots where the males have dancing grounds,
and so normally the trapping of them would have presented no
great difficulty. But we discovered that they give up their dancing
displays during the rains and disperse throughout the forest. We
saw and heard odd specimens but the drenching vegetation and
swollen rivers were such a handicap that we had to abandon the
idea, with regret. After my departure I heard that they all returned
to their old haunts once the dry season had set in, so I hope

to return one day to try my luck when the conditions are
favourable.
On our way back to Quito I saw several Rieffer's Grass-green
Tanagers (Psittospiza riefferi) and managed to catch one. They
are large Saltator-like birds with yellow feet and an orange bill.
Ecuador is a most interesting country for the ornithologist,
but to anyone wishing to accomplish a certain task in a limited
time it is most exasperating. The Ecuadorian people have no
sense of responsibility whatsoever, and no sense of time. They
cannot and will not understand why anything should be done on
a certain day if it can possibly be left over to some future date.
Consequently arranging for transport in the way of porters or
mules was a business calculated to try one's temper to the utmost,
for usually all the arrangements misfired. The people concerned
seemed most surprised if you asked them why they had failed
to turn up, as if it were the most natural thing to do.
My luck was not of the best in Ecuador and I had a series of
rather disappointing adventures, but the final episode capped
everything. This occurred when the collection was being trans-
ported from Quito to the coast. This was a two-day journey by
rail, with a halt for the night at the half-way station. Having paid
some fabulous sum for a truck to be attached to the passenger
train and having made all arrangements with the heads of the
railway departments for the journey, someone detached the truck
and attached it to a goods train in the middle of the night, when we
were sleeping at the halt. I awoke at 5 a.m. to find that my birds
had gone. In an endeavour to overtake them I arranged for a
motor trolley, but the goods train had five hours' start and so it
was nearly 11 a.m. when we linked up. By this time all
the Humming-birds were in a torpid state through being without
food. Some of these I managed to revive but quite a lot succumbed.
This was a bitter experience after months of hard work in difficult
mountain country. Apart from such episodes the cost and
difficulties of hunting out species which are interesting and new
to aviculture in such an uncivilized region are out of all proportion
to the recompense such as is forthcoming in these times.

(4) Javan Great-billed Barbet, Chotorhea javensis (Horsf.)
The Javan Great-billed Barbet is one of the rarest appearances
in the aviaries of zoological gardens or in the cages of aviculturists.
It must have been brought to Europe for the first time about 1936.
Three years ago I received a bird of this species not yet in full
plumage. It is a little larger than the Blue-cheeked Barbet. Its
beak is stronger and broader and its colouring is quite distinctive.
It is chiefly dark green in colour, paler on the underside. The
crown of the head is bright straw yellow, the neck feathers having
narrow olive-green edges. Above each nostril there is a small red
spot and on each side of the root of the lower mandible a lemon-
yellow one. Chin and throat are scarlet. The eye area is black.
The black extends back up to the temples and downwards along
the yellow corners of the mandible and widening, frames the red
throat. On each side of the black throat stripe is a red spot. The
quills are black with yellowish outer edges. The lesser wing coverts
are marine blue, as are also the underside of the tail feathers.
Beak and feet are black. The iris is gold. The bird inhabits Java.
In its native state it is said to like the fruit of the fig-tree,
somersaulting cleverly through the branches in order to obtain it.
It pulls off the fruit with its beak, dashes it two or three times
against a thick branch before it swallows it. If there is no branch
against which to dash it, the fruit is crushed and pressed by the
strong beak. According to Brehm, the Javanese call it Tschodok
and Brehm names it from its call, the Mourning Barbet.
The Javan Great-billed Barbet I kept reminded me in character
of the Blue-cheeked Barbet. It is perhaps somewhat heavier than
the latter. It is plumper and displays less activity in the aviary. It
becomes agreeably tame. A short time ago I saw at an importer's
here three Javan Barbets which were very tame and took fruit from
one's hand. They moulted in the autumn from the dark juvenile
plumage, in which all the distinguishing colours were only faintly
marked, into the beautiful adult dress. The very characteristic

call of this Barbet could be heard mostly in the mornings and late
afternoons. It sounded like " tulung-tumpuk, tulung-tumpuk ",
and was often repeated. Like most Barbets it quickly learned to
know and greet its keeper. It devoured a good mash with the
addition of fruit and berries according to the time of year. It too
refused meat or meal-worms. It lived with a pair of the pretty
little Chestnut-capped Laughing-thrush --Rhinocichla mitrata (S.
Mull.)--from Sumatra. The Laughing-thrushes avoided the Barbet,
which hissed or clattered at them with its powerful beak if they
tried to approach.
( 5 ) Yellow-cheeked Barbet, Chotorhea chrysopogon (Temm.)
One specimen of the Yellow-cheeked Barbet came to Germany
for the first time in 1937. It is one of the largest representatives of
the Barbets. In many respects it reminds one of the smaller relatives
of the Toucan, the Green Arassari. It seems to be an intelligent
bird, tame and friendly. Its beak is very long and broad, especially
suitable for the picking and dividing of fruit. It is more powerful
than that of the smaller Javan Barbet.
The Yellow-cheeked Barbet was put in a cage at first and
accustomed to a mash with the usual additions. Meal-worms and
small pieces of raw meat were refused by this bird also. It was
not tame at first, but neither was it shy and later became quite
friendly. When accustomed to its surroundings, it was put in a
large aviary with a Fire-tufted Barbet and a pair of White-headed
Woodpeckers, Melanerpes candidus, which had formerly been the sole
occupants of the cage. The communal life of these four birds was
not a success at first, in spite of the fact that there were sufficient
sleeping holes and a great number of more or less thick branches
and trunks in the enclosure. The White-headed Woodpeckers
were aggressive and often flew at the Barbets, but soon the former
came to respect the Barbets and left them alone. Now the Yellow-
cheeked Barbets became the disturbers of the peace and would not
agree with the Fire-tufted Barbets. Gradually, however, they
became accustomed to one another, i.e. each had its sleeping-hole
and avoided the other. Thus, apart from little squabbles, peace
reigned in some measure.
In character the Yellow-cheeked Barbet resembled its relation
from Java, which apart from size, it also resembled in shape.

It is like too, in voice and in the rhythm of call, except that the
calls are louder and deeper and sound like a low, quick drumming.
A year later, two other Yellow-cheeked Barbets came to Berlin,
but they did not live long. The bird kept by me died suddenly at
the end of a year. Up to the end it was lively, though it must
have been a very sick bird as was shown by the autopsy. It suffered
from an advanced stage of liver disease.
These Barbets are a beautiful grass green in colour. Forehead
and lores are dark scarlet, the upper part of the head is pale brown
as far as the middle, from the middle to the back it is red, single
feathers having a narrow blue border. Under each eye is a black
spot, temples and ears are brownish black, while a dark blue
horizontal line runs above the temples. A gold band, bordered
below by an ultramarine-blue stripe runs from the corners of the
mouth down the lower part of the ear-coverts. Chin and throat
are smoke-brown, single feathers having yellow shafts. The under-
side is light grass green. The pinion feathers are brownish black,
bordered with light yellow. Tail feathers are green, dark marine
blue on the underside. The iris is brown, the broad and long beak
black, the feet dark olive brown. Length of wing : 126-152 mm.
Tail : 87-93 mm. Its habitat is Sumatra and Malacca.
(6) Fire-tufted Barbet, Psilopogon pyrolophus (S. Mull.)
The Fire-tufted Barbet from Sumatra was imported into
England in 1929 (Avicultural Magazine 1929, p. 10). The
strongly developed forehead bristles give the bird a distinctive
appearance. To this is added another peculiar arrangement of
the feathers, namely the tuft formed of narrow green feathers over
the eyes. The black forehead bristles have light red tips.
The Fire-tufted Barbet is doubtless one of the most beautiful
of the Barbets. Its plumage is always smooth in good health, a
characteristic of all Barbets. It is very lively and needs a large
aviary to move about in. It is very graceful in all its movements
and differs therein from the afore-mentioned larger species. It is
slimmer, the tail is longer than that of the species described above
and it is always nimble and quick.
Its food is similar to that of the other species. It dislikes meal-
worms and raw meat. At night it usually sought a half-opened
box in which to sleep. It sat there with tail erect and tilted slightly

forward, a sleeping posture it adopted even when spending the
night on a branch. It got on with the Yellow-cheeked Barbet as
far as that was possible for both of them. The heavier Yellow-
cheeked Barbet would not suffer the former near it, especially at
the feeding-dish. On this account several food receptacles were
placed in the aviary. Without doubt the Fire-tufted Barbet is one
of the most interesting, beautiful, and graceful of the Barbets.
Besides the above-mentioned six Asiatic species of Barbets,
four African species, which in some respects differ from them, have
up to now been kept in aviaries. The African forms I have kept
seem to be more lively, energetic, and robust than their cousins
from Asia. They are less sensitive to changes of temperature, low
temperatures, and are in general more hardy. During low
temperatures the plumage of the Asiatic forms was lanker and they
appeared less lively, signs of a less healthy condition. In general
during the winter they were kept at a temperature of 18-20*
Celsius. However, in extreme cold it sometimes happened that
the temperatures of the inner aviary dropped at night. The
African species too were less difficult to feed. They liked more
animal food, were fond of meal-worms and other insects and their
larvae, in addition to raw and cooked meat. One can therefore
vary their diet more. Many species, as for example the Yellow-
breasted Barbets and Levaillant's Barbet, will also eat seeds.
(7) Pied Barbet, Tricholaema leucomelas (Bodd.)
In the spring of 1937 I received from an aviculturist a Pied
Barbet, which had already lived for eleven years in captivity. It
was a pretty little Barbet, which always lived with a Red-breasted
Barbet --Lybius tridactylus. The Pied Barbet naturally showed signs
of age, which increased with time. It died of old age in its thirteenth
year of captivity. It was very fond of meal-worms and small pieces
of raw meat, fruit and mash. It could swallow quite large pieces
of fruit without great difficulty. At night it retired to a sleeping
hole with the Red-breasted Barbet.
(8) Red-breasted Barbet, Lybius tridactylus (Gm.)
The Red-breasted Barbet is a smaller Barbet, like the Pied
Barbet, with which it is very friendly. Both have strong toothed

beaks. The Red-breasted Barbet is a very lively fellow, which
gives a croak-like call now and then. It lived quite peacefully with
the other inhabitants of the aviary, a pair of Ruby-throated Bulbuls
--Rubigula dispar --and White-bearded Honeyeaters --Meliornis
novaehollandiae. I may say that the smaller, more graceful, but more
aggressive Honeyeaters ruled in the aviary. This Barbet, though
strong-beaked, never attacked another bird, but only defended
itself when the Honeyeaters became too oppressive. As far as
possible, it tried to avoid these birds. Now and then it gave its
peculiar triple call, to which it owes its scientific name. These
Barbets are also very hardy and a German aviculturist kept one
for eleven years.
Like the Pied Barbets they are very beautiful birds, although
they lack the brilliant green colourings of the Asiatic species.
Their greater hardiness is probably accounted for by the fact
that as they will eat living insects, raw meat, etc., they are easier
to keep for their diet can consequently be made more nourishing.
Fruit and berries are not as important for them as for the other
species.
The Red-breasted Barbet, like the Pied Barbet, has been seen
only rarely in Germany and then as single specimens and is therefore
difficult to obtain. The former is related to the Black-collared

am always enamoured afresh by these beautiful and lively birds.
The various pairs I have kept in the course of years were always
alike in character and behaviour. The last pair has now been
living in my aviary for five years. It is an advantage that in this
species the sexes are easily distinguished, the male having a black
spot on the crop, which is lacking in the female. The mates were
very faithful to each other and resemble in this respect the
ornamental finches. They always live peaceably together and
usually with other species of birds also. As soon as they become
accustomed to their surroundings and feel at home, they are always

lively and active. They are distinguished from the other Barbets
by their somewhat slenderer and more graceful form and the
comparatively long tail, which helps to give the bird a more
slender appearance.
The typical plumage of the bird always appears again after
each moult in its natural colouring and freshness. They moult
regularly in midsummer. The red colouring of the under tail-
coverts appears again in undimmed brilliance, neither do the
yellow tones pale at all. During the morning hours especially, the
series of rhythmic calls can be heard for a long time. As soon as it
becomes light the " song " commences, soon followed by that of a
second pair, and resounds through the whole house. Other Barbets
often join in, a remarkable concert, which never sounds
inharmonious, but always enchants the listener.
One pair lived quite peaceably for several years in company
with a pair of Grey Sibia-- Sibia picaoides simillima --and White-
eared Bulbuls-- Pycnonotus leucotis --but suddenly in the summer
of 1937 the peaceable behaviour of the pair left much to be
desired. The Yellow-breasted Barbets suddenly became hostile
to the rare Grey Sibia. They persecuted them and injured
the female on the head. She soon recovered again, as did the
exhausted male. There was nothing to be done but to remove the
Sibia. The smaller Bulbuls were not molested. Later a pair of
the bold and cheeky Black-headed Sibia-- Leioptila capistrata
capistrata --were added, which were also persistently persecuted by
the Barbets. There was nothing for it but to place the Barbets
with the pair of White-eared Bulbuls in a smaller aviary, in order
to give the beautiful Sibia more freedom of movement in company
with other species.
The Yellow-breasted Barbets were always anxious to breed in
summer, and then again during the months December to January.
They often visited the nesting-boxes in the daytime. The male
especially, hung on to the entrance-hole of the nesting-box and
looked in with jerky movements of the head as if he were feeding
young through the hole. Now and then he looked at the female
and flew off, leaving the hole to the female which behaved in like
manner. The same process was repeated with food in the beak.
At this time the Barbets hammered a great deal in the nesting-
boxes. They also struck the stone and " rabitz " walls. They

knocked such a large round hole in one of these walls, that they
could slip into the next aviary. In their free state these birds nest
in steep river banks and such-like places. They hammer and dig
their nesting-holes in the earth and nest there like our Kingfishers.
The second pair kept at the same time behaved in like fashion.
However, they did far less damage to the walls. Both lots could
frequently be observed pairing, but it never resulted in egg laying.
The cleaning of aviaries in which Barbets, especially Yellow-
breasted Ba t bets, are kept, has many " pleasant surprises " for the
keeper. As one enters the aviary these birds will spurt their
excrement with sure aim into the intruder's eye, so that one's
eyeglasses are covered with an impenetrable mass of fluid excrement.
It is pleasant to get a full complement direct in one's eye ! It
stings and twitches beautifully for a time. It is not an easy matter
to free one's eye from it. In my opinion, therefore, the keeping of
Barbets at least has a somewhat less pleasant side to it.
(10) Levaillant's Barbet, Trachyphonus cafer (VieilL)
In the summer of 1937, a few pairs of the South African
Levaillant's Barbet, one of the most distinctive and beautiful types
among the Barbets, arrived in Berlin. These brilliantly coloured
birds are nearly related to the Yellow-breasted Barbet, but they
are larger and more brilliantly coloured. When they fly, the
glittering black, white barred and bordered wing feathers are
especially striking. The female is smaller and duller in colour
than the male bird. Both have a glittering black crest which is
erected in excitement. It is considerably smaller in the female.
The greenish, horn-yellow beak is very strong.
In character and behaviour they resemble closely the Yellow-
breasted Barbet, but are still livelier than the latter. They are
always in movement or busy. Any unfamiliar object is a matter
of curiosity, and causes an up and down movement of the crest,
while the tail is jerked first to one side then the other. The peculiar
call of the pair is often to be heard in varying degree of loudness.
These calls can be likened to the loud strokes of an alarm clock.
Frequently, however, one hears a soft ascending and descending
trill, principally from the female.
After the birds had become accustomed to their surroundings,
they took up their abode in a large aviary in company with other

birds such as the Bengal Red-vented Bulbul --Pycnonotus hengalensis --
etc. The nesting-boxes in this enclosure were immediately inspected.
The Barbets were anxious to breed. They behaved at this time
in exactly the same manner as the Yellow-breasted Barbets. First
the male and then the female hung in feeding posture at the
nesting-hole, looking at the other male. They too tried to strike
the walls. In the wild they nest in the same manner as their
relations, the Abyssinian Yellow-breasted Barbets. Wooden
structures were also hammered. However, no brood appeared
that year. It seems as if Levaillant's Barbets have a desire to breed
the whole year through.
Later on in February the desire increased rapidly. The female
often disappeared into the nesting-box for long periods. Now and
then hammering could be heard. The male frequently flew to the
box and brought food to the female. When meal-worms were
given, the male took several in his beak and brought them to the
female. However, on inspection of the nesting-box, no eggs were
to be found. I assume that the Barbets ate them, as this was
observed in the case of a late brood.
As already mentioned these birds live quite peaceably with
other inhabitants of the aviary. But when one day the Yellow-
breasted Barbets invaded the aviary through a hole knocked in
the dividing wall, they were set on by the Levaillant's Barbets
and doubtless would have been killed by these stronger relations,
if the incident had not been observed immediately.
In May of last year the Barbets were again most anxious to
breed. The female disappeared for a long time into the nesting-
box. On inspection of the nesting-box on the 30th June, the
female was found sitting on two eggs. Apparently the disturbance
upset her, for she only brooded another four days. During this
time the hen bird did most of the sitting, the cock relieved her
several times during the day for short periods only. A few days
later it was seen that the eggs were no longer in the box and the
Barbets had apparently eaten them. The nesting-box was similar
to that used for Budgerigars. So ended the dream of rearing
Barbets. However, this species had been bred a few years previously
in France (. LOiseau , 1928).
Levaillant's Barbets are hardy and robust and their health is
not affected by lower temperatures.

Perhaps the least known of South American waterfowl are those
to be found in the high Andes and, with the solitary exception of
the Andean Teal (Anas andium ), all the species are represented in
Peru. Two years ago I attempted, amongst other things, to make
a live collection of some of these waterfowl and perhaps a few notes
on them may be of interest to members.
My activities were confined to the Department of Huancavelica,
and Lake Junin in Central Peru. In the former I spent some four
months collecting skins, working at various localities between
8,000 and 16,000 feet. At Lake Junin, a notable locality for water-
birds, I spent about the same period of time. The lake, situated
at an altitude of 14,000 feet in the open plateau, is of no great size
but is extremely shallow and bordered by immense reed beds.
Ducks, Geese, Coots, Ibis, and other birds swarm there in remarkable
numbers.
The environs of the lake are fairly well settled and perhaps the
least common waterfowl in the locality is the handsome Andean
Goose (Chloephaga melanoptera ). This is one of the largest Chloephagas
and a very fine bird, pure white save for a good deal of black in the
wings, and with a pink bill and pink feet. The sexes are alike but
the male is very much larger than the female. In the more out
of the way parts of the high Sierra the Andean Goose is very
abundant and I have seen them in fair sized flocks. I never saw
them below 14,000 feet.
Though technically waterfowl, these birds never go near water
save under exceptional circumstances. I have seen a bird settle on
water when frightened by gunfire, but otherwise the only examples
observed in water were adults with young on small lakes around
Lake Junin. This, however, I regard mainly as a local measure
of security, and not as a general habit. The goslings are easily
hand-reared, and quite a number are reared thus by the natives,
mainly, I am afraid, with the object of eating them when adult.
It is interesting to note that my experience with these native
reared birds is that there is always an excess of males, a disparity
which appears usual among birds reared in Europe. These birds

are kept at semi-liberty and become ridiculously tame, always
coming home in the evenings to sleep with the family and all the
domestic animals. Curiously enough I never heard of a case of
Andeans kept under these conditions becoming spiteful, as they
nearly always do in Europe. Perhaps they always end up in a
cooking pot before they have a chance of becoming truculent !
A bird which I was able to add to the known fauna of Peru
was the South American Comb-duck ( Sarcidiornis carunculata) , a
female of which was shot near Lake Junin. What this bird,
essentially a species of the tropical lowlands, was doing at that
altitude, I cannot imagine.
A very beautiful and distinctive species, probably related most
closely to the Sheld-ducks, is the Crested Duck (Anas cristata alticola ).
This is a large, rather slender duck, greyish-brown in colour and
with a long pointed black tail. The flanks are dappled with paler
markings and the speculum is a beautiful coppery red. The iris
also is red and the feathers of the nape are elongated to form a
drooping mane. They are mainly to be seen in ones and twos on
small lakes in the Puna zone. They do not appear to favour large
tracts of water such as Lake Junin, although I have seen unusual
concentrations of up to thirty birds feeding on the margins of that
lake. They swim low down in the water, and their length gives
them a most unusual appearance. All my birds became very tame
and familiar, and its hardiness and beauty make it a most suitable
species for avicultural purposes.
The common Chilean Pintail (Anas spinicauda ), so widely
distributed throughout South America, is found in the Andes as
far north as Ecuador and is a common bird on Lake Junin. It is
too ugly and common to arouse much interest. I did, however,
bring one pair over with me, and found them the hardiest, easiest,
and most fool-proof birds it would be possible to imagine.
The little Sharp-winged Teal (Anas oxypterum) is found in all
suitable localities from 10,000 feet upwards, and is very adaptable,
occurring with equal freedom on lakes and streams. In appearance
it is not unlike the Chilean Teal but is altogether larger and more
delicately coloured, a very smart and elegant little bird. It is a
most hardy and satisfactory bird to keep, and the ducklings are
easily reared. The Sharp-wing is found in the Andes from North
Chile to Peru. In Ecuador and Colombia it is replaced by the

Andean Teal which differs amongst other things by possessing a
black bill. It would be a most desirable introduction. Another
Andean duck with which I failed to meet is the highland form of
the Cinnamon Teal {Anas cyanopterus orinomus ), which is only known
to occur in South Peru (Lake Titicaca) and North Chile (Tara-
paca). Though a larger bird than the lowland race, the male
does not differ in appearance, only the female having some slight
differences in coloration.
The finest of all the mountain ducks is in my opinion the Puna
Teal {Anas puna), a bird which somewhat resembles the better-
known Versicolor Teal. It is, however, very much larger, and
I regard it as being considerably more handsome. It differs from
the Versicolor by lacking the yellow spot on the bill, the white
of the face is purer and cleaner, and it is more delicately barred on
the back. Apart from the voice there is a noticeable sexual differ-
ence, which is almost invariable, in the colour of the speculum,
which I am told is not the case in the Versicolor. In the male at
all ages the speculum is green. In a few very old females it is
occasionally similar but in the young female it is dull brown and
becomes greenish with age.
The Puna Teal is abundant in the high Andean Lakes but I have
never seen them at a lower altitude than Lake Junin. Outside of
Peru it is found only to the south in Bolivia and Northern Chile
and Argentina. It is a species that is naturally tame, even wild
caught birds, and it has proved a most satisfactory species in
captivity.
The list of Andean waterfowl must be brought to an end by
the inclusion of two very peculiar species, the Ruddy Duck
(.Erismalura ferruginea) and the Torrent Duck (Merganetta armata
leucogenis). The former is a member of the stiff-tailed lake ducks,
of which only the North American {E. jamaicensis ) has hitherto
been kept in captivity. I think it is the biggest of the genus, a
stumpy, short-necked bird with a relatively huge bill. The tail is
composed of hard stiff feathers and is usually carried cocked up
at a ridiculous angle over the back. It is a comic sight to see a party
cruising about, looking for all the world like an array of little
battleships. At times, however, particularly when feeding, the
tail is depressed. The female is dull blackish-brown with a black
bill ; the male bright chestnut with a sky-blue bill and black head.

It is a very handsome bird and in bright sunlight looks quite red.
The feet are relatively enormous and the bird is very clumsy on
land. They are immensely strong and not particularly difficult
to keep. Though their natural food consists largely of small water
snails, and small crustaceans, they learn to take wheat in captivity.
I brought back three females. The Ruddy Duck has a wide
altitudinal range for I found it in all the high lakes visited, and also
on a lake at 8,000 feet on the upper borders of the subtropical zone.
Outside of Peru it is found in Ecuador and southwards to Tierra
del Fuego.
A very striking contrast to the Ruddy Duck is provided by the
Torrent Duck, perhaps the most highly specialized of all the
Anatidae. In shape they are extremely slender with very long legs
and tail. The neck is long and slender, topped with a small head,
and the bill is minute ; the wings are adorned with a large spur. The
male has a white head and neck, with narrow black streaks through
the eyes and down the neck. The upper parts are black and the
belly is a mottled grey. The female is mainly chestnut with blackish
upper parts. The bill and feet are red in both sexes. They are
about as big as a Chilean Teal but, of course, very much more
slender. In fact so slim are they that the only example I possessed,
a male, could pass through 2 in. mesh wire netting.
The Torrent Duck is well named for it is found exclusively
in rushing mountain streams in the Temperate Zone. I have only
seen it at altitudes of 10,000 to 13,000 feet, and it is not found in the
Puna. It has, however, been recorded from well down in the
subtropical zone by other observers. Closely allied forms are found
from Colombia to Tierra del Fuego. They delight in the wildest
rapids and scorn tranquil and sluggish stretches of water. In such
places they may be seen perched on projecting boulders, sometimes
sitting upright, almost like a Cormorant. When alarmed they
jump into the water and slip buoyantly and easily downstream,
treating the fiercest maelstroms with complete indifference. Some-
times they dive through rough water, but as a rule remain on the
surface. They aid their progress when necessary by hopping
actively from rock to rock, and one rarely sees them in flight,
save when thoroughly alarmed. It is my ambition to bring home
live examples of this curious duck. The one specimen I ever had
only lived 24 hours but I think it had been injured in capture.

I doubt if it would thrive in an ordinary lake or pond, but would
be most likely to do well when kept in clear running water with an
abundant supply of natural food such as caddis flies, small fish, and
other aquatic creatures.

Six coloured plates and many photographic and text illus-
trations adorned Volume V of the New Series of our Magazine
which commenced in November, 1906. The first plate figures the
heads of six species of Quail of the genus Coturnix and was, perhaps,
one of the most useful plates ever published in the Magazine for
it shows the distinguishing characters of practically the whole
genus. I was myself particularly interested in this group of birds
at the time and in the accompanying article describe the breeding
habits of the Rain Quail (C. coromandelica ), the Harlequin Quail
(C. delegorguei ), and the Australian Quail (C. pectoralis) which had
taken place in my aviaries. This is followed by directions as to
the keeping and breeding of Quails, and as these birds seem to
have rather gone out of fashion and to be little kept or understood
at the present time, perhaps I may be allowed to quote here from
what I wrote more than thirty years ago :--
" To keep Quails of the group we are now considering successfully, they must
have a fairly large run which is well turfed and in which cover is provided by
low bushes or bundles of brushwood. Part of their enclosure should also be
roofed over and sanded so as to provide a place for dusting and scratching. My
new aviary, in which no less than three species of Coturnix have lived together
and reared broods during the past summer, measures about 42 feet by 21 feet and
is turfed and planted with trees and shrubs and has a pond in the centre, and the
birds have access to a dry, well lighted shed. The aviary is tenanted by many
birds including Ground Doves ( Geophaps ), besides the Quails and two species
of Turnix. It is, therefore, not necessary that each pair of Quails, in order to
breed successfully, should have a place to themselves.
" As the nesting season approaches the males are apt to drive one another
about, but no serious battles are likely to take place, and, in the case of the three
species I have had under observation during the past summer, no cross-breeding
has taken place as I feared it might with such closely allied forms as C. coromandelica
and C. delegorguei.
" The female generally selects for a nesting site a thick clump of grass under
which she draws together a few blades of dry grass, the growing blades being

carefully arranged over her back so as to render her invisible from above when
on the nest.
" The clutch varies somewhat with the species, six being the lowest number
and thirteen about the highest for a single bird. The eggs are laid daily until
the clutch is complete when, providing the surroundings are to the bird's liking
and she is not disturbed in any way, incubation commences. At this time the male
deserts the female entirely and seeks another mate, so that, if the enclosure is
sufficiently large, it is well to have two females to each male. If, however, there
is no other female present, it is advisable to remove the male as soon as incubation
commences, otherwise he may worry the hen and cause her to desert her nest.
" A note should be made of the date on which incubation commences so as
to be able to calculate the date of hatching. Incubation varies from sixteen to
eighteen or nineteen days in the case of Coturnix, and probably depends slightly
upon the temperature of the weather.
" A critical time arrives when the hen leaves the nest with her brood. If she
should get frightened she may run some distance, calling her chicks, which will
do their best to follow her, though some may be too weak to do so and promptly
die from cold. My own plan, which has worked most successfully, is to confine the
hen and her brood in a small run by themselves for at least a fortnight. The
runs I use are about 6 feet long by 4 feet wide, about 12 or 18 inches
high, boarded at the sides and wired over the top, and with one end made
to open to facilitate the often difficult task of drawing the birds in. Part of the
top is made to open for feeding. This run is placed upon a flat piece of ground
on which is plenty of good grass, and care has to be taken that no space is left
anywhere below the sides through which a chick could squeeze. Over part of the
top brushwood is placed as a shelter. The hen and her chicks are then carefully
and gently driven towards the run and when once in they may be considered
perfectly safe from harm and easy to rear. In fact I cannot remember ever losing
a young bird when once I had them safely confined thus. There is no fear of their
being disturbed or robbed of their food by other birds, and there is no chance
of their wandering from their mother or she from them and not being able to get
to one another again."
Mr. H. C. Martin contributes a very interesting article on
the " Urraca " Jay which an Editorial footnote identifies as
Cyanocorax pileatus. He describes his aviary in Uruguay and many
of the interesting birds to be seen in that country. Dr. Albert
Gunther describes a further success in breeding the Red-backed
Shrike in his aviary at Kew.
In my review of the previous volume I mentioned the discovery
and naming of Mrs. Johnstone's Lorikeet which hails from the
mountains of Mindanao, and in the present one Mrs. Johnstone
describes the nesting of this rare species and the rearing of two
young birds. The second plate illustrates the White-bellied
Plumed Dove (.Lophophaps leucogaster ), and in the accompanying
article is a text-figure of the display of this charming species, of
which, later in the volume, Mrs. Connell records the successful
breeding.
W. H. St. Quintin describes the breeding in his aviaries of the
Pine Grosbeak. Of the species as an aviary bird he writes, " If

anyone wants a charming pet for a garden aviary, which will be
tame with its owner and gentle to its fellow captives, and at the
same time one which will never give him a moment's anxiety
in time of bad weather, let me recommend the Pine Grosbeak.
I have now kept several for nearly two years and know no hardy
bird which shows itself better and is so lively without being restless
and timid." Farther on he writes, " On the 28th May my man,
Arthur Moody, saw the hen Grosbeak arranging some twigs in
the fork of a yew in rather an exposed position, but to some
extent screened by the upper branches of the bush. To his surprise
she took up a small bit of a dry spruce branch which he tossed
on the ground and carried it up and laid it with the others, and
for some twenty minutes or so she picked up twig after twig as
fast as he threw them down for her. . . . Pine roots and coarse
bents were used as a lining, but no feathers or soft material."
Three eggs were laid and two hatched, the young being successfully
reared. " The hen Grosbeak would come on to the fingers of one's
hand and take off the palm the fresh ants' eggs (pupae), small
caterpillars, and sawfly grubs which alone were given at first to
the young."
J. H. Gurney describes the successful breeding in his aviaries
at Keswick Hall of the Jackal Buzzard (.Buteo jakal), one young
bird being successfully reared.
E. G. B. Meade-Waldo contributes a very interesting article
on the birds seen during the historic cruise of Lord Crawford's
yacht, the Valhalla , in which he and Michael Nicoll travelled as
naturalists.
Mrs. Johnstone writes on the nesting of Fraser's Touraco
(Turacus macrorhynchus ), this time successfully, the young bird being
reared to maturity.
Hoopoes are such charming birds when seen in their natural
state that many aviculturists would like to add them to their
collections. To these I would draw attention to a note by Meade-
Waldo, who writes, " Hoopoes in confinement are always difficult
subjects. They appear to require much warmth, although they
can support for a short time considerable cold ; but I think that
the heat that seems necessary for them is to an extent dependent
on their bodily health. They want plenty of room, a dry compart-
ment, no farinaceous food, any number of mealworms : you

cannot overdo them. The only really good Hoopoes I ever saw
that had been long in captivity had practically nothing else. Such
grasshoppers, leather jackets, etc., as can be provided, with yolk
of egg, ants 5 eggs, etc. They require deep gritty soil to keep their
beaks in order. They are very liable to split and curl, but with
everything in their favour, even when kept in their native land
and fed practically on their natural food, they are not easy to
keep long, although they are delightfully tame, confiding pets."
Reginald Phillipps, who had probably kept more Hoopoes than
anyone, thought that mealworms could easily be overdone and
that the chief cause of failure in keeping these birds was the difficulty
in keeping them warm enough throughout the year. He says that
his birds were not wholly insectivorous and partook of milk sop, rice
pudding, stewed pear, and boiled cabbage ; were fond of tomatoes
and stewed onion, cherries and red currants.
A half-tone plate illustrates the two Australian species of
Munia, M. flaviprymna and M. castaneithorax , with two specimens
intermediate between these. When obtained these had been
typical examples of the former, but, apparently as a result of the
English climate, had begun to develop dark markings on the plumage
characteristic of the latter, and it is suggested that the Yellow-
rumped Finch (M. flaviprymna) is a desert form of the Chestnut-
breasted Finch (Af. castaneithorax).
The arrival at the Zoo of a collection of twenty Humming
Birds from Venezuela is recorded. These were placed in glass
cases in the old Insect House (now the Rodent House) and kept
at a high temperature, but none survived for any length of time.
Another arrival about that time was a specimen of the New
Zealand Kakapo (Stringops habroptilus) , the curious, flightless Owl
Parrot, now on the verge of extinction.
Another event at the Zoological Gardens at this time was the
opening of the Small Bird House which served its purpose for
many years and is now a Tortoise House.
One of the most noteworthy avicultural events that has taken
place at the Fondon Zoo was the breeding in 1906 of Avocets in
the Waders 5 Aviary which is fully described by Mr. R. J. Pocock.
Three young were hatched though two died at an early age.
The article is illustrated by some delightful line drawings by
Herbert Goodchild.

M. Cordier accompanied me to Indo-China last autumn.
While I was collecting skins in North-West Laos with Messrs.
J. Greenway and F. Edmond-Blanc, he went to Chapa, a hill-
station in Tonkin, close to the Yunnan border. In 1929-1930 we
had made there a remarkable collection of skins, obtaining over
fifty new forms. Chapa stands at an altitude of 5,000 feet, and the
neighbouring chain of the Fan-si-pan reaches 10,000 feet.
M. Cordier arrived on 12th May, with about 300 birds, many
of which are new to aviculture and extremely attractive. The
greatest part of them are now at Cleres and at Foxwarren. As they
inhabit quite a cold country, where frost and snow are not uncommon
in winter, they should prove very hardy. Perhaps a few words on
the more interesting species may prove of some interest to our
readers.
Golden-throated Barbet ( Cyanops franklini )--one of the
prettiest of the medium sized Barbets, with black, yellow, red,
and grey markings on the head.
Long-tailed Broadbill ( Psaris omus dalhousm )--a marvellous
bird, emerald green, with lovely blue, yellow, and black markings
on the head and wings, and a long, narrow blue tail. A common
forest bird in damp country, purely insectivorous, and difficult to
keep, which had never been brought alive before.
Fulvous Pitta {Pitta oatesi )-- a large high-ground Pitta, of a
beautiful pinkish chestnut, with green upper parts. First arrival.
Elliot's Pitta {Pitta ellioti ) --one of the handsomest of all
Pittas ; my pair, imported three years ago, build and nest every
year, but destroy their eggs. The nest is dome-shaped, but wide
open in front.

Scarlet-backed Flowerpecker ( Dicosum cruentatum ignitum) --
a tiny bird, black above, with a broad scarlet band from head to
tail ; buffish white underparts. Difficult to keep and first imported.
They do well on mashed potato and banana, mixed with insectile
food.

Dabry's Sunbird ( JEthopyga dabryi) --one of the finest red
Sunbirds, living at high altitudes in North Burma, Indo-China,
and in China. It ought to prove quite hardy. I suspect this species
to have an eclipse plumage. It will be interesting to find it out by
observation in captivity.
Dark Rosefinch {Procarduelis nipalensis) --one of the most
beautiful of all Finches, of slender and pretty shape ; the cock is
dark scarlet and rosy pink. Lives at high level ; is new to aviculture.

pretty species.
Lesser Orange-headed Thrush {Geocichla aurimacula) --a very
small race of the well-known species.
Indo-Chinese Shama ( Kittacincla interposita )--very similar to
the Indian Shama, but the hen is darker and better marked. Very
fine songster.
Blue-tailed Bush Robin ( Tarsiger cyanurus )-- a pretty migrant
from North-East Asia.
Plumbeous Redstart ( Rhyacornis fuliginosa) --an interesting
water-side bird.
Spotted Forktail {Enicurus maculatus guttatus) --a mountain

black and white birds have a very elegant shape and the most
attractive ways.
Slaty-backed Forked tail {Enicurus schistaceus) --a smaller
species.
Large Niltava {JViltava grandis )--a fine and hardy species.
Not a cage bird, but it does well in a planted aviary.

Rare Birds from Chile.
Mr. Alastair Morrison has recently returned from his second bird-collecting
trip to South America : this time to Chile. He has brought a number of rarely
imported live birds and a series of skins, etc. Here is a list of what he has brought,
as far as I remember, and remarks of avicultural interest :--
Steamer Duck ( Tachyeres ). Several brought.
Kelp Goose, Chloephaga hybrida (Molina). Two dozen or more. Very rarely
imported and said to be bad doers. When Aviculture , vol. ii, appeared (1931),
only three cases of importation were recorded : Zoo 1868, Berlin later, and a
third brought to Holland by Blaauw more recently ; all were single birds and
none lived longer than a few months. We will hope this lot will do better ; the
ones I saw certainly looked strong and were feeding quite well. Anyhow their
reputation for frailty seems to be based on very little evidence, if it is really the
case that there have been only the three importations referred to.
Magellanic Penguin, Spheniscus magellanicus (Forster). Four which have been
taken by the Zoo, where this species has been at least once before.
South American Black Oyster-catcher, Hamatopus ater (V.). A pair, which
are, I believe, a first arrival.)
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.712847111111111" page_id="56322909"  page_num="271" year="" vol="">
Black-faced Ibis, Theristicus melanopis (Gm.). Rare, but have been in the
Zoo and elsewhere, and also bred in captivity.
Partridge Tinamou, Nothoprocta perdicaria (Kittl.). Four, which have gone
to Mr. Ezra. This Tinamou has been imported before and was bred by Shore
Baily (Avicultural Magazine, 1929, 251).
Chilean Pigeon, Columba araucaria. Very rare ; once in the Zoo a long time
ago (about 1876) and was bred in France in 1922 (Avicultural Magazine,
&amp;apos; 933 , 79 )-
Black-winged Dove , Metriopelia melanoptera (Molina). Six, which Mr. Ezra
</table>

took, as he also did the araucaria Pigeons (2). The allied M. cecilia was imported
by M. Delacour in 1938 and one pair nested and reared a young bird with him.
Curl-crested Aracari , Beauharnaisius beauharnaisi (Wagler). A single example
of this new Toucan, which went to Mr. Ezra, as did all or most of the remaining
birds.

<reference confidence="0.9899572">
D'Orbigny's Slaty Finch, Xenopspingus concolor (D'O. &amp; Lafr.). One ; new.
Black-and-white Seed-Finch Sporophila luctuosa (Lafr.). Also new.
Yellow-bellied Ground-Finch Pseudochloris auriventris (Phil. &amp; Landb.).
Also new, I think, but Mr. Morrison brought some of the Peruvian P. uropygialis

The Collections of Mr. Shaw Mayer and Mr. W. J. C. Frost.
Two very fine collections of rare birds made by Messrs. Shaw Mayer and
W. J. G. Frost arrived together on the 2nd July. Mr. Shaw Mayer was
unfortunately taken ill on the voyage and had to go into hospital on arrival,
but is now progressing favourably.
In Mr. Mayer's collection there were no less than nine species of Paradise
Birds, including Paradisea augusta-victoriae , Tricho-paradisea gulielmi , Parotia wahnesi
and Astrapia rothschildi , but perhaps the most striking of his specimens was a pair
of thrush-like birds of great beauty-- Eupetes pulcher.
A Monkey-eating Eagle ( Pithecophaga jejferyi) which went to Mr. Whitley,
is the second example of this fine species from the Philippines to reach this country.
There were a number of fine Pheasants including Bulwer's, Gray's Argus, and
Palawan Peacock, as well as a magnificent Baud's Pitta.
Mr. Frost's collection contained four species of Paradisidae, including
Schlegelia wilsoni. and Parotia sexpennis ; Rothschild's Grackle, Temminck's Blue
Roller, several rare Rollers, a Maleo, Pied Java Sparrows (Munia fuscata), Munia
quinticolor and Timor Zebra Finches ( Taeniopygia insularis ), in addition to a large
number of other rarities.

Waterfowl are becoming increasingly popular with aviculturists who possess t
the right conditions for their maintenance, and it would appear that this is so in
other countries as well as Great Britain. The Curator of the Auckland Municipal
Zoo, Lieut.-Col. Sawyer, is very interested in this group of birds and has recently
greatly increased his collection of importations from England and America,
while his collection of native New Zealand species is one of the most extensive in
the Dominion. Colonel Sawyer would be glad to get into touch with those interested
in this group of birds.
The " Little Widow "
A Little Widow Tyrant ( Xolmis irupero) that died in the Zoo Bird House
recently had lived for four years in a cage. When it arrived, the intention was
that it should live in the aviary in the Tropical House, but its appearance there
had an extraordinary effect upon the other occupants who were, one and all,
frightened almost to death by the appearance of this small but ghostly white
apparition. Hiding in corners and under rocks or leaves, they refused to feed or
to move while the Widow was there, so there was nothing for it but to remove her.
This beautiful little bird from tropical South America may be compared in
size to a common Robin, but its plumage is of the purest white, relieved by very
black eyes, primary wing-feathers, and tail tip.

BEHAVIOUR OF AUSTRALIAN SHELD-DUCK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.955219605263158" page_id="56322911"  page_num="273" year="" vol="">
Since waterfowl are my favourites, I am much interested in the letters of
Mr. Laidlay, Mr. Mood, and Mr. Pape regarding the Australian and the Radjah
Sheld-ducks.
As reported to you before, the pair of Australians at our Florida place became
very ugly and pugnacious as soon as they got into breeding condition. They
were equally as nasty as a pair of Paradise or South African. These birds were
wild-caught.
The pair which we kept at our place in the north made no effort to nest,
and were (and still are) most peaceable in a mixed collection of waterfowl. These
also were wild-caught birds. We have lately brought up the pair from Florida,
and have them with several other sorts of ducks, and since they have got over
the breeding fever, they get on perfectly well with the other Ducks in their pond.
Contrary to Mr. Pape's experience, our Radjah Sheld-ducks are most peaceful
and very retiring in disposition. This may be because we have only two and I am
rather sure both are females.
It is splendid that both Mons. Delacour and Mr. Moody have bred the
Australian Sheld-ducks. I hope both rear the young to maturity. The award of
medals for finest breeding is a splendid gesture that we might well copy in America.
At the same time, it dosn't make so much difference who breeds a species for the
first time, as that it is bred by someone and a new species perhaps started on the
way to being available for many to enjoy.
Reverting again to the behaviour of the Australian Sheld-ducks, it seems to
me that the difference in behaviour is in part a matter of the individual. We have
Cereopsis Geese which are absolutely vicious, with humans as well as other
birds. Yet we also have one bird, a female, which was not pinioned, and this
bird flies about from one enclosure to another, and up on the lawns and anywhere
she can find someone, and she is as gentle with other birds as any bird we have.
Possibly it is because she was the smallest of a brood and got special attention
when a gosling, but she belies the usual pugnacity of the Cereopsis. I've noticed
with other sorts of birds also that individuals vary in disposition more than one
would reasonably expect. A pair of breeding Ruddy Sheld-ducks here are
absolutely peaceful, yet another pair we once had could not be allowed with
even such large birds as Swans, and they accounted for quite a lot of deaths before
we realized how very bad they were and got rid of them. Evidently that's the
way it is with the Australian Sheld-ducks.

GAPE WORMS IN YOUNG EIDERS AND GOOSANDERS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999827" page_id="56322911"  page_num="273" year="" vol="">
We are indebted to such pioneers in the art of keeping and rearing sea ducks,
as Messrs. Moody and Laidlay, for the easiest way to feed successfully young
Eiders and other sea ducks, viz. by allowing them a liberal amount of earth-
worms at least during the first four weeks. However, I would like to give a word
of warning to the Aviculturists intending to try the rearing of these birds in
certain districts where gape worms are prevalent.
This month (July), owing to shortage of better food, I gave a good amount
of earth-worms to a small pen of young Eiders and young Goosanders, all about
a week old. Within two days, one third of the Eider ducklings had succumbed
to what the post-mortem proved to be a severe attack of gape worms. Three

quarters of the young Goosanders were also badly affected, but up to now I
have managed to keep them alive (as well as the remaining Eiders) by giving
them daily some drops of " Aniodol interne " rubbed inside the windpipe by
means of a soft long feather (Budgerigar tail feathers are quite suitable for the
purpose). This cure for gape worms is well known to Pheasant breeders, and
I hope will prove successful in the case of sea ducklings.
I must admit that the earth-worms were collected here in soil which had
perhaps been soiled by Pheasants and domestic Turkeys, but the strange thing
is that scientists consider that gape worms in Waterfowl belong to a species of
Syngamus quite distinct to the species affecting Gallinaceous birds.

THE CLONCURRY BARNARD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997056043478261" page_id="56322912"  page_num="274" year="" vol="">
Innumerable as are the obstacles placed in the way of private aviculturists
anxious to secure a limited number of Australian birds, certain Continental
dealers this summer have been importing, almost wholesale, the choicest and
rarest treasures. I declined what in ordinary times would have been the tempting
offer of White-tailed Black Cockatoos new to aviculture and the almost equally
rare Funereal Cockatoo, but when Cloncurry Barnards appeared on the list
I first refused the offer, but later succumbed. After all, even if a mad world is
bent on quite unnecessary suicide and the voice of constructive reason falls
usually on deaf ears, it is worth while to see a new Broadtail--before we make
ourselves food for the crows !
And the Cloncurry Barnard really is a new Broadtail, so unlike the other
races of Barnard's Parrakeet that it is a bit more than a good sub-species, especially
if intermediate forms--and I have not heard of any--do not occur. It is a very
lovely bird, very light in colour, as Barnards go, and with far less dark and blue
shading and marking. The general plumage is a bright, rather pale green, with
the usual Broadtail blue in wings and tail, but no red frontal band and practically
no dark shading on the head and mantle. Across the lower breast extends a
very wide band of uniform, rich buttercup yellow, which forms a striking contrast
to the rest of the plumage. If my birds are a true pair which, from the shape,
the head I hope they may be, the hen is as brilliant as the cock. This phenomenon
has been observed in one other sub-species of Barnard--or at any rate in the
case of certain individuals of one other sub-species--but as a rule hen Barnards
are decidedly duller than their males.

The Red-flanked Blue Bush Robin is rather a rare bird in
European aviaries, although it is a popular cage bird in northern
China. I remember seeing many freshly caught specimens on
the Peking bird market in October. The northern race of this
Robin (T. c. cyanurus) is a common migrant there in the autumn,
and is caught in numbers. It travels south and spends the winter
in Indo-China. Every year, in the northern half of this country,
it is met with in forests, always near the ground and often along
roads and paths. Immatures are there much more numerous than
adults. They are quite tame and easily approached. In their ways
they remind one of Redstarts more than any other European birds,
wagging their tails incessantly.
In the Himalayas a resident geographical race (T. c. rufilatus)
is found at high elevation ; it differs from the northern bird in
having light blue instead of whitish buff highbrows, brighter and
deeper general colours. This non-migratory race is depicted on
the adjoining plate and has been brought over on a few occasions.
In south-west China and Tonkin lives a somewhat greener
resident race {T. c. pradieus).
In captivity Red-flanked Blue Bush Robins, purely insectivorous,
are silent and unobtrusive. They require the same treatment as
Redstarts and Chats. They can be kept in adequate cages and
in aviaries. At present, I keep two specimens in densely planted

By Dr. J. M. Derscheid
{Continued from page g6)
In the March issue 1 of our Magazine I tried to show the
importance of establishing permanent breeding stocks of all kinds of
Waterfowl in order to help to maintain the rare species on account
of their scientific interest, and even the commonest for their utility,
or value as game birds. Let us see how such an aim could be
. attained.
There are several aspects of the problem, owing to the amazing
diversity of this group of birds. In short, it is evident that the
starting point must be to secure a sufficient number of birds of
a species, likely to become breeders, either by importing wild-
caught adult birds, or by securing eggs fresh enough to be still
hatchable under control. As a rule Duck, Geese, and Swans are
large- or medium-sized birds, commanding everywhere the attention
of even casual observers, and this is probably why the percentage
of species already imported alive is I believe larger (in comparison
to the number of kinds still to be caught and imported) than in
any other order of birds, the Parrots excepted.
To give a very rough idea, I may mention that about 200
different species of Waterfowl ( Anseres ) are known to science,
including perhaps ten kinds which became extinct in historical
times. Something like 100 species have been already more or less
freely imported alive and kept in captivity, often in great numbers.
Some thirty other species have been received less frequently or in
quite limited numbers, and another thirty so exceptionally that
they have never had the slightest chance to become seriously
established. One may estimate again at thirty the number of

species which, as far as I know, have never been received alive
in Europe or North America, or even kept by amateurs in their
own country of origin.
Every true aviculturist will understand that these species of
Duck, Geese, and Swans which have never been imported, or
only very seldom, have therefore a special interest for us. In
several cases it seems not unreasonable to hope that these gaps
will be filled in the near future, the attention of the bird collectors
being naturally drawn more especially to these birds. Of course
rarity in the natural habitat of the bird is often the chief obstacle,
especially when combined with wariness and shyness of habits,
and also lack of accessibility of the country. This is, for instance,
the case of the Auckland Island Teal (, Nesonetta aucklandica) which
lives in a remote corner no longer connected by any regular ship
line with the civilized world. A great pity, for it would be of special
scientific interest to study fully in captivity the life (including
embryology) of that aberrant flightless member of the Teal group.
Highly valuable research work could likewise be carried on on
the famous " Steamer Ducks " ( Tachyeres ) of the Patagonian coasts,
one form of which at least is also flightless in the adult stage.
These birds, which are considered as being a modified type of
Eider (a hypothesis contradicted by biogeography), are very seldom
imported here ; nearly always as isolated specimens which find
their way chiefly to Zoological Gardens, and they have never
been given a real chance of breeding in confinement under suitable
conditions. I may add that their proper care is apparently not
yet well understood.
The strange and probably very heterogeneous sub-family,
Merganettince (Torrent Ducks), is entirely made up of Ducks still
completely unknown to Aviculture. The true Torrent Ducks
(about six species of the genus Merganetta) are evidently well
protected against capture by their habit of frequenting only the
most torrential waters in the desert parts of the high South
American mountains. They might also prove to be not at all
too easy to keep alive in captivity. On the other hand, the Blue
Mountain Duck ( Hymenolamus malacorhynchus) of the New Zealand
Alps would, I am sure, be much more amenable to captivity.
It would be a great achievement to breed a number of them in
confinement, as in nature the species is rare, very local, and seriously

threatened by extinction on account of the gradual settlement of
the country. A few odd Blue Mountain Ducks have already been
kept even in barn-yards, without any special difficulty, by New
Zealand amateurs ; but it seems evident that the most important
step towards success in establishing a breeding stock would be of
a diplomatic nature, viz. to persuade the New Zealand Government
authorities to relax, for this special purpose, a little of their usual
severity in enforcing their bird protection laws.
The last kind of so-called Torrent Duck, the New Guinean
Salvadorina waigiuensis (unknown in Waigiu I. in spite of its name),
is still too little known to allow us to express any opinion about
its eventual comportment in captivity. But here again we have
one of these ornithological puzzles, making more desirable the
establishment and careful study of the bird in captivity. Here our
hopes of a successful importation of a live consignment .must lie
entirely on the skill, experience, and enterprise of some first-class
bird collector, as probably we need no less than a Goodfellow, a
Shaw Mayer, or a Frost to bring safely home such living treasure.
As a rule Duck are rather bad travellers on long trips, and require
to be packed in specially constructed boxes and to receive en route
selected food and intelligent care.
The Brazilian Black-capped Teal (Heteronetta atricapilla ), never
imported, would be another valuable addition to our collections,
and its life history could perhaps throw some light on its still
enigmatic affinities (although, of course, it has no relationship
to the species mentioned above). Cuckoo-like in its breeding
arrangements, this little Teal is said always to use the nests of other
Duck and to let foster parents rear its young, but much is still
obscure in this story. I have been told that a single bird of this
kind was being kept in captivity, two years ago, by a Brazilian who
obstinately refused to part with it.
There are quite a number of other Duck which never reach
the hands of the European or American aviculturists, either on
account of lack of enterprise by the bird collectors, or of actual
inaccessibility of their country of origin (or sometimes by the effect
of protection laws indiscriminately applied, this being more often
the case in young Countries, Dominions, and Colonies freshly
awakened to their duty towards Nature). Mention of these species
will be made later on.

Progress in the Art of keeping Waterfowl in captivity
Waterfowl keeping is an extraordinarily ancient hobby and
was practised in classic times by the Greeks and, probably with
still more skill, by the ancient Egyptians. The Romans, too, had
extensive collections of Ornamental Duck and Geese besides the
farms where domestic waterfowl were raised in great numbers
for utility purposes. According to Columella and other authors,
the aviculturists of those days already knew quite a lot about
their job ; for instance, among the species enumerated as frequently
bred in confinement, we find the Common Teal, a bird which we
know to be quite a shy breeder. Americans of pre-Columbian
times must have been also attracted by this hobby (as they were
by Parrot keeping), and certainly they managed to keep and even
truly to domesticate the Muscovy Duck ( Cairina moschata) before
it was sent to Europe and other parts of the world in the sixteenth
century. Indians and Chinese, since the beginning of historic
times, Have likewise always been fond of keeping Duck and Geese,
and when we come to Japan, we find that in medieval times,
according to old paintings, they were skilful enough to keep in
their gardens and probably even breed in confinement the Crested
Sheld-duck ( Pseudofadorna cristata) from Korea ; a magnificent
bird so rare that only three skins are at present known to science
and it is feared that the species is now extinct, or very nearly so.
In recent years quite a number of people in western countries,
and a few in U.S.A., have taken to the hobby of keeping and
breeding waterfowl with a view to seriously studying their habits
and requirements. Therefore real progress has been made even
in the last few years, in evolving a scientific technique of keeping
and even breeding these birds. Two or three examples could
perhaps be given here of such progress. The introduction to the
late Dr. John G. Phillips 5 monumental Monograph of the Ducks
(written in 1922) includes two or three pages on " behaviour in
captivity 55 which give us a fair view of the opinion of an expert
on the matter some fifteen years ago. We find there such state-
ments as the following :--\0x25A0
" . . . only a half-dozen species can be classed as among
those that lay readily in confinement, and the great proportion
of Ducks can either not be reared at all, or only with great

difficulty, as a sort of avicultural ' stunt 5 . . . then there is
a large class of Ducks that simply do not keep healthy in
captivity, and are short-lived when deprived of wild food.
Such are Shovelers, Scaups, Canvas-backs, Golden-eyes, Eiders,
and the fish-eaters. Ruddy Ducks only live a week or two. . . ."
This rather discouraging picture is of help in measuring the
progress made during these years. Among the examples mentioned
by Phillips, we can say that shortly after this was written, Hugh
Wormald and Colin McLean, followed by a few other aviculturists
in Great Britain, managed (with the help of Phillips himself) to
start a good breeding stock of Canvas-backs ( Nyroca valisnerid)
which is still flourishing. Out of the four known species of Shovelers
two--the European Shoveler ( Spatula clipeata) and its South
American cousin Spatula platalea --are also strongly established and
bred regularly every year. The Cape Shoveler ( Spatula capensis ) &amp;apos;
is a more recent addition to our stock, due to the enterprise of
my friends, R. and N. Stevens, and has not yet been given a fair
time to increase in confinement. The last one, Spatula rhynchotis,
from Australia and New Zealand, is still very poorly represented,
although it was successfully bred immediately after being introduced,
a few years ago, at Cleres by Jean Delacour. Difficult to rear, as
the other Shovelers, at the early stages, this species will need some
experienced hands to start it, but it appears to be quite a free
breeder in confinement. This is one of the species for which the
responsible Governments should take special measures, not in order
to prohibit their keeping in captivity or exportation, but in order to
give support to serious aviculturists ready to help in breeding them.
Phillips mentions the Ruddy Ducks as especially difficult to
keep alive ; elsewhere he says that " the Spiny-tailed, or Ruddy
Duck family do not bear captivity ". Since that time we have
happily enough been shown that this was not the case, and we
have kept Ruddies or " Stiff-tails " in captivity for many years
in the best of health. The North American Ruddy Duck ( Erismatura
jamaicensis ) has now for years been bred in confinement every season
by some American aviculturists, and also by Messrs. Stevens at
Walcot Hall. This allows us to be quite optimistic about keeping
and breeding the other species of the genus as soon as a sufficient
stock of wild caught birds is obtainable.

J. M. DERSCHEID-PRESERVATION OF WATERFOWL 28 l
To the European ornithologist perhaps the most interesting
species would be the White-headed Stiff-tail (. Erismatura leuco-
cephala ), a fine European bird which seemed to have completely
disappeared in recent years from its classical range, the Mediter-
ranean basin, so that several authorities feared that the bird was
extinct, or nearly so, as a species. It was comforting to hear a
year ago that one of the most interesting observations made by
Peter Scott during his trip to the Persian shores of the Caspian
sea was the sight of hundreds of these fine little Ducks in that
district.
The three other species of the genus are all black-headed (adult
male), but they are similar to the preceding in having a bright
blue bill. " Blue-bill " is, in fact, the local name given to the
Australian Stiff-tail, Erismatura australis , a rare or rather very
local species which has never been received alive in Europe. It
would be fine if Australian ornithologists and aviculturists could
help us to secure a small stock of this little known bird.
Its South American counterpart, Erismatura ferruginea , repre-
sented by the typical form in Peru, by another sub-species
(E. f. vittata) in Argentine and Chile, and perhaps a third form
in Ecuador {E. f. aquatorialis), is also very little known, and up to
now, only the Peruvian bird has been imported alive, three
specimens being brought eighteen months ago by Mr. Alastair
Morrison. One of these succumbed to the hard weather of last
December, but the two others (2 $ $ ?) are still in good health
in my collection. However, I have never seen Ducks so slow to
come into colour, and even if they would condescend to breed,
a single pair is nothing to start a stock. When we come to the
African Stiff-tail (. Erismatura macoa), a close cousin to the preceding,
we find that it has been brought alive only once ; I believe two
years ago, by a skilful aviculturist, Capt. B. Howard. We are
without news about the results of this importation which we hope
will be followed by others.
Another genus of the same group is made of the White-backed
Ducks, birds whose English name is only surpassed in stupidity
by their scientific name " Thalassornis 55 ; the so-called white back
is the least pronounced feature in their plumage, and no bird
is so lacustrine in habit and so adverse to going to sea. ... I do
not believe that the typical form, Thalassornis leuconota leuconota,

from Central and South Africa has ever been brought alive to
Europe, but in recent years the Madagascar sub-species, Th. 1 .
insularis , has been received by several of us, and it is encouraging
to know that it has been regularly bred during the last four or five
years by Mr. Alfred Ezra, at Foxwarren Park. I have a suspicion
that if the bird has not yet been bred in other large collections, it
might be due to the difficulty in distinguishing the sexes, a point
to which I intend to come back later on. A fresh consignment
of these White-backs is expected from Madagascar next Autumn
under the able care of Mr. Webb, and this might help considerably
in settling the species as a regular breeder in confinement.
In the West Indies and part of South America, is found another
Stiff-tail, the charming Masked Duck (Nomonyx dominicus ), still
practically unknown to aviculture. In most islands of the Caribbean
Sea, where that little Duck was more or less abundant, the Mongoose
has been introduced, and is said to be a terrible menace to the
species ; a really important field of work is therefore open to
Waterfowl breeders in this respect. Last year my friend Sibley
managed to secure a few eggs of Masked Duck and to hatch two
youngsters, the first ever born in captivity. They were doing quite
well, when they were swept out--with many other things !--
by the hurricane which crossed New England on 21st September,
1938-
The last, and also by far the largest, member of the sub-family
Erismaturintz , the Australian Musk Duck (Biziura lohata), is also
an exceedingly interesting bird, only imported from time to time,
and then always in very small numbers, or as odd specimens.
A great pity, as it has not yet been given any good opportunity
to nest in captivity under proper care, although a few odd ones
have proved to be good doers in living a number of years in public
zoos. Six months ago a pair arrived at last at Walcot Hall, and
it is to be hoped that Messrs. Stevens will be successful with these
and that several other pairs will follow.
We have reviewed the various members of the Stiff-tail sub-
family, as this is typically a group about which our predecessors,
the aviculturists of last century, knew practically nothing, and
where real progress has been made quite recently. In other groups,
better known, some modern successes are also worth recording.

For instance, nearly all the members of the Sheld-duck sub-family
(Chloephdgina) are good livers in captivity. There was only one
exception, the Kelp Goose ( Chloephaga hybrida ), a Patagonian
bird said to be so exclusive in its diet of kelp and seaweed, and
so delicate, that it could simply not bear confinement. Even such
an experienced aviculturist as the late Mr. Blaauw had to give up
trying to import this species, although he went so far in his attempts
as to import at the same time large quantities of kelp from the
Argentine. . . .
Last winter, however, Mr. Alastair Morrison succeeded in
bringing back from South America many pairs of Kelp Geese in
good health, indeed a fine achievement. From what I heard
recently from Cleres (where most of these birds went) they are
doing splendidly on a diet which is not at all special, and we
cannot see any reason why the Kelp Goose should not at last
become well established in our collections. The five other members
of the same genus (the so-called Upland Geese) are all also well
established in Europe, although in the case of the Andean Goose
(Chloephaga melanoptero ) it would certainly be worth while to
strengthen the present breeding stock by a good fresh importation.
The Ashy-headed and the Ruddy-headed Geese, which were so
hard to obtain a few years ago, are now much better represented
and are breeding regularly for a few fanciers.
Thanks to the true aviculturists interested in Waterfowl, and
especially to those who take the trouble to publish their observa-
tions, every year we learn more about the correct method of
keeping our Duck, Geese, and Swans, and every year the list
of the species considered too difficult to bear captivity is shortened
by such progress. The forward steps have been notably encouraging
since ten years when we consider the most interesting group called
Sea Ducks. Golden-eyes, for instance, are now much more
extensively kept and sought after, and their proper management
may be considered as well understood now, some individual birds
having already lived in collections for more than ten years, some-
times breeding every year. This applies chiefly to Barrow's Golden-
eye (. Bucephala islandica ), which is reared yearly by three or four
breeders, either from eggs collected in Iceland or from eggs laid
in captivity. The Common Golden-eye ( Bucephala clangula ) has
also been found to do quite well even on small ponds with com-

pletely artificial food, and the late Mr. Blaauw used till his death
to breed it every summer at Gooilust. Unhappily the maintenance
of this species in our collections still lies nearly entirely on wild
caught birds. Freshly caught Golden-eyes are among the most
difficult birds I know to accustom to captivity, having very often
to be fed by force for several weeks before eating by themselves.
Here is a point where our friends, the Scandinavian ornithologists,
could be of great help, by assisting us to secure fresh eggs of Common
Golden-eyes for hatching purposes. Very large numbers of these
eggs are taken every year from the nests, chiefly in Lapland and
Finland, just as food, and the toll imposed on the wild stock would
certainly not be heavier if a small percentage of these eggs could
go to the aviculturists instead of being eaten by the Laps ! ! Exactly
the same thing can be said of the Golden-eye's cousin, the Smew
(Mergus alhellus }. We found by personal experience that it is
extremely hard to obtain in Northern Europe fresh eggs of Smew
for incubation purposes, the chief difficulty being apparently that
the authorities in countries like Finland simply refuse, under any
pretext, permission to take out some eggs, even although, in some
districts, a great number of nests are robbed every year by the
natives.
Our readers will have seen in our last March Magazine (p. 96)
a detailed and extremely valuable report by Mr. Wintle on the
successful breeding of Smew at Walcot Hall. This article, by the
way, has provided us with information of high scientific value on
the life history of that species, of which even the incubation period
was still unknown to ornithologists. The large size (14 acres)
of the lake on which the breeding of Smew occurred prevents us
from saying that Smew will breed just as well on the more common
type of pond, but from personal experience I can say that, once
well established, Smews may be kept year after year in perfect
health on small pieces of water. I am sure also that Smews born
in captivity (if necessary several successive generations of them)
will gradually become less exacting in the matters of size of enclosure
and amount of natural food.
There are some other species of " Sea Ducks " which are a
little more difficult to keep in captivity, a proof that we have still
a lot to discover about their exact requirements. The American
sub-species of Common Golden-eye ( B. c. americana) and the

charming tiny Buffle-head ( Bucephala alheola) are said to be
moderately easy to keep in health, and both have already been
bred by one or two fanciers in U.S.A. (see Sibley's article, p. 79).
I have not found special difficulty in keeping the Buffle-head here
on a small pond of slow running water, and there is probably no
difference at all in the treatment needed by the American and by
the European Golden-eyes, the two birds in fact being quite hard
to distinguish. Two species already much more difficult to keep
in real health for a long time are the Harlequin Duck ( Histrionicus
histrionicus ) and the Long-tailed Duck ( Clangula hyemalis). The
Harlequin, which is, to my mind, the finest of all Waterfowl, is
comparatively easy to cater for at first, even when newly hatched,
although of course more delicate than Golden-eyes and all the
fresh water species. But for some mysterious reason, after a year
or two, or even three, in confinement, they seem to "go light "
and die unexpectedly. They are also bad travellers and sometimes
they die just as the result of one or two days journey or perhaps
of the change in habits and surroundings. They are also, I think,
sentimental birds, and I know of a fine little drake Harlequin,
already in adult dress, which had formed a very strong attachment
for the Black Scoter I had reared as its companion ; when I had
to separate them last Spring, the Harlequin died within three days,
probably of broken heart. Another Harlequin in Delacour's
collection took a liking to Mandarin Ducks, and used to follow
them up and down hill for miles, till it apparently died of exhaus-
tion.
Harlequins are naturally tame and should breed in captivity
just as well as Golden-eyes, but primum vivere. . . . Before attaining
that end, we have first to find out exactly what is right and what
is wrong in our present day methods of keeping this species, and
so bring it really into breeding condition. Exactly the same may
be said of the Longtails, which are still probably one degree more
difficult in management. Quite easy to accustom to captivity
when wild caught (and far better than Golden-eyes in that respect),
even adult birds which have been netted become tame in a few
days. Every year we succeed also in rearing quite a few youngsters
from wild collected eggs and so do two or three Waterfowl breeders
in England, but nearly all Longtails, either hand-reared or wild
caught, prove to be, alas, short-lived in captivity. Shortly after

the War it was considered very fine to succeed in keeping a Long-
tailed Duck alive for just a few months ; we are already further
than that and recently some of our Longtails have lived two years
and more ; but still the proper method of management has not
yet been discovered.
These difficulties are further aggravated in the case of the
Scoters, a group I would describe without hesitation as among
the hardest and most exasperating birds to try to keep and to
maintain in good condition. This applies to wild caught and to
hand-reared birds, and to Velvet and Black Scoters (the latter
species only having been up to now hand-reared, as the few Velvet
ever kept in confinement were all full sized birds when caught).
The main problem with Scoters is that these high-sea birds so
badly built for walking on the ground, most of the time develop
a strange and obstinate aversion to water, quite often immediately
after being caught, or when two to three months old when hand-
reared. Feather troubles soon follow and generally the bird dies
after lingering a few weeks or months in a miserable state. There
are very few people indeed--among whom Messrs. Stevens, Jean
Delacour, and the late Sir Philip Sassoon--who have ever succeeded
in keeping Scoters in good health and feathers with any amount
of success. However, I am convinced that this again is just a
question of discovering the true cause of the trouble, and accordingly
giving the birds the proper treatment they require.
Among the remaining Sea Ducks, it is a pity that the Eider
group is still so poorly represented in our collections. The Common
Eider of Europe is doing well on the ponds of quite a few aviculturists,
although still unrepresented in most of the public Zoological
Gardens. It breeds quite freely in confinement, but still most of
the hand-reared young Eiders come from wild eggs. It would,
however, be a wonderful sight if some enterprising amateur, with
a large pond of clear water, would try to establish a true little
colony of Eiders breeding for him. Among the sub-species of
Common Eiders, up to now I failed to rear and establish here
the Faroe Islands Eider (the smallest of all), all my eggs being
rotten or too stale for incubation. However, Common Eiders
reared here from eggs imported from Iceland proved to be slightly
but decidedly smaller than my Eiders from Scotland, Holland,
and Germany, and perhaps Hachisuka was right when he expressed

unknown to aviculture and this is also the case with Steller's

both would be most interesting acquisitions, but they inhabit
grounds far remote from civilization, the most likely place from
where to obtain them being Northern Alaska !

were males and both did not live long, but it is to be hoped that
future importations may be more successful, the more so as there

where these birds are killed in tremendous numbers and their
eggs taken by tens of thousands every year. Being a less maritime

These beautiful birds have not been given as much publicity
as is due to them. Some have referred to their melancholy habits,
harsh noises, etc., and I am wondering if the disparaging remarks
are due to the exhibition of them under unfavourable conditions,
as it has been found here that, if suitably displayed, they make
one of our most beautiful exhibits.
The glorious plumage of both the hen and the cock birds
seem always to raise the old controversy as to whom has the greater
appeal, the bright colour of the hen being in striking contrast to
the duller feathering of most females of the Parrot Group.
However, it is more in reference to the breeding of these birds
that I wish to record. As is well known, reports of their multiplying
under aviary conditions are rather sparse, and the question was
raised as to whether there was some particular reason as to why
they did not mate, whether it was due to unsuitable housing, wrong
class of food, insufficient flight in the aviary, and so forth.
In their wild state in New Guinea, reports that I have received
have given the information that they were known to the natives
under the name of " Kalanga 55 and were observed to feed heavily
on paw paw fruit, bananas, sugar cane, and other foods in the
Kokopo District.
However, it was not possible in Sydney to procure all these
fruits except periodically at certain times of the year and
consequently a varied diet was prescribed consisting of a mixture
of sunflower seed, oats, hemp, millet and canary together with
fruit such as apple and banana supplemented with plenty of
lettuce, some occasional spinach, and a little of the dandelion
plant.
Although the first birds were received here in 1933 and others
were added to the collection from time to time, up to the end of
1937, no increase took place.

R. A. PATTEN-RED-SIDED EGLECTUS PARROT IN CAPTIVITY 289
Towards the latter end of 1937, I fortunately succeeded in
making a contract with a grower of lucerne in the famous Hunter
River District of this State to supply this succulent food which is
well known to be rich in Vitamin E and having a rich mineral
content.
Feeding experiments were at first carried out with our
herbivorous animals and a thorough check up of our foods was
at the time under review. So encouraging were the subsequent
results with these creatures, both in connection with increase in
births and in their condition generally, that lucerne was introduced
into a number of aviaries and, as a result, the Eclectus Parrots had
added to their diet chart plenty of this succulent food, also a little
parboiled maize.
Early in 1938, the plumage of these Parrots was noticed to be
greatly improved and altogether it was apparent that they were
more attractive in every way. Although it was observed that they
only occasionally bathed in the pond provided, it was noticed
that they took full advantage of rain showers and would delight in
exposing themselves to all but exceptionally heavy squalls.
The aviary allotted to them faced due North providing the
maximum of sunlight. It was rather spacious having a width of
12 ft., height 8 ft., and flight 25 ft., J in. netting being used with
galvanized piping supports and on the south side a well
constructed shelter kept out the cold southerly winds. This allowed
them plenty of freedom and it was noticed that they certainly took
full advantage of it.
One pair of birds (hereinafter called A) was provided with a
box, 12 in. by 9 in. by 9 in., and out of the right top-hand face a
space 4 in. by 4 in. was removed to enable them to enter. This
nesting box was placed inside the house or shelter away from the
weather.
The other pair of birds (hereinafter called B) were given a
hollow log 2 ft. 6 in. long, the hollow itself 6 in. in diameter,
plugged at one end. This nesting box was hung in the open flight.
Both nests were provided with an amount of earth and decomposed
wood as found in most of our old gum trees in and around this
locality.
From each of the nests A and B, two young cock birds emerged
in April. However, it was observed that, although the hens looked

after the youngsters, all was not well with them, and they were
weak and. unsteady on their legs and unable to fly. On investi-
gation they were found to have rickets. Unfortunately at this
stage, one of the young birds died from each nest.
The other two were removed to the hospital and force-fed on
boiled maize with the addition of cod-liver oil and a little malt
extract combined with halibut oil. On this diet they made
wonderful progress until old enough to participate in the adult
food and developed into two lovely Parrots.
The adult birds now had cod-liver oil added to their diet On
30th August, 1938, a very fine young cock left B nest and on 12th
October, 1938, two more young--a cock and a hen--emerged
from A nest. On 14th December, 1938, one hen emerged from
B nest.
Towards the end of December it was decided to finish breeding
and to take out the nests. In attempting to do so, we discovered
that in A nest two more birds were just hatched. Consequently
the nesting boxes had to be left intact to prevent any interference
with the young. However, the nests were constantly under
observation, and were finally removed to provide the adults with
a well earned rest.
On 14th January, 1939, we experienced one of those shocking
days of heat, which one reads of, but rarely encounters. The
weather had been sultry and a heat wave had been forecast. Will
we ever forget that day ?--the temperature of Sydney rose beyond
all records and the glass went up to 116 0 F. taking unfortunately
in its wake the breeding hen from B nest. Fate was most unkind
to this gallant little mother.
The young birds were removed and cared for in the hospital
where we hand-fed them on boiled peas with a liberal amount of
cod-liver oil for three weeks, when they were changed over to
parboiled maize supplemented with cod-liver oil and banana.
These birds were gradually brought up together with the
earlier arrivals and subsequently placed on the food supplied to
the adults. We now have quite a fine collection of these Eclectus
Parrots and we hope to release them in a special avairy when the
warmer weather comes to hand.
It was confirmed that the number of eggs laid at each period
was two of white colour. The sexes are quite clear in the nest--

the cocks showing green feathers and the hens red--from the time
the feathers commence to form at approximately one month of
age. The young birds stay in the nest for some two months from
the time they are hatched. When they are getting their feathers
it is noticed that, in the hen, the mandibles are at first a slaty
grey colour. This gradually darkens and at six to eight months
becomes totally black.
The cock bird, on the other hand, has the upper mandible a
dull yellow ochre colour and, as time goes on, the base of the
mandible turns to red, leaving the tip of the beak a brilliant
orange. In both sexes the eyes are brown and the feet slaty grey
in colour up to six months when the feet gradually become
darker in colour.
I thought we had certainly lost one during their removal to a
bright room to enable a photograph to be taken for record purposes
for Dr. E. Hopkinson. One managed to escape from the keeper
and disappeared in high trees outside the boundary of the Gardens.
However, we were agreeably surprised to find a little later in the
day that it returned to its companions and was once more in safe
keeping.
From our observations, it would appear that the hen bird did
all the incubation and, as the young were hatched, the male bird
certainly fed the hen but we could not say definitely whether he
helped in providing food to the young birds other than supplying
the mother.
I am of the opinion that the Red-Sided Eclectus Parrots are
very sociable, at least in a large aviary such as supplied to the
ones in question and do not appear to fight or injure others in
the enclosure. Altogether it can be stated that they are very
striking and beautiful birds and are the medium of much favourable
comment.

(&amp;apos;Coriphilus ultramarinus)
By The Marquess of Tavistock
The breeding of this Lory of necessity marks the apex of my
achievements in rearing birds of the Parrot family, for the simple
reason that for rarity and beauty, combined with need for very
careful management, there is no species that I shall keep likely to
be its equal. In my more despondent moments I am also tempted
to wonder whether the summit of my achievements in aviculture
may not also be my swan-song, for, in these days of international
upheaval, what hope is there for the long survival of hobbies and
cultural pursuits ? Indeed, I am sure X only spared the young
Lory to leave the nest because it amused him so much to see me
too worried by " crises " to take a proper amount of interest in
its welfare, or joy in its appearance !
As recorded in previous articles my hen Ultramarine or Goupil's
Lory was only snatched back from the jaws of death by our dis-
covery at the eleventh hour of the correct diet for this species
new to aviculture--Allinson's Food, as for other Lories, but
Allinson's Food diluted again with its own volume of water after it
has been prepared as for infants and sweetened. The mixture is
given fresh twice daily with a little marmite and tomato juice
added and lime-water is given when breeding is in prospect.
Pear, grapes, and apple are supplied and, when young are being
reared, the insides of eight to twelve mealworms mixed with two
to three teaspoons of honey and water. During the three years
I have had her the hen Lory has shown herself extremely ready to
go to nest, but her zeal to rear a family has not been equalled by her
good fortune. Before we gave lime-water she had trouble with
soft-shelled eggs and at all times she is liable to get egg-bound,
although she sits dutifully after the egg had been laid in hospital.
On two previous occasions the single egg was incubated for the
full period and proved fertile, but failed to hatch owing to a dent in
the shell. The cock sits, but not as much as a cock C. peruvianus ,
during the early stages of incubation. Later, when the young
bird arrives, he is very attentive and both parents spend the night
in the log.

The nest was a grandfather clock box with the base standing in
a vessel of water and during incubation more water was poured into
the peat some way below the nest-level through a funnel, the base
of which pierced the wooden side of the box. On top of the peat
was a layer of decayed wood. My hopes of breeding Ultramarine
Lories were at a low ebb during the past winter. The hen had got
rather badly egg-bound with a soft-shelled egg in the autumn and
to discourage her from further efforts at reproduction I put her
in a different compartment to her mate. For some reason he came
out into the open flight much less this winter than last and although
I could not see anything definitely wrong with him I expected his
early demise.
In February, owing to disagreements between the young
Tahiti Blue Lories, I had to put the Ultramarines together again,
hoping that the absence of a nest would keep the hen from laying.
However it did not--for she got egg-bound during the latter part
of February and the egg laid in hospital was unluckily damaged.
We then gave her a nest and, although the pair were dropping
a lot of feathers, another egg arrived safely on the 28th. The young
bird was first heard on 27th March and emerged on 20th May--
a very nice, well-grown bird. The time spent in the nest was con-
siderably longer than in the case of the Tahiti Blue Lories I bred
last year.
For part of the time a hen Blue-crowned Hanging Parrot shared
the aviary with the Lories, but we removed her when the young
bird arrived as the cock Lory rather resented her presence. On
the whole, however, C. ultramarinus is a much more gentle bird than
the smaller C. peruvianus, a spiteful little creature, of which it is
afraid.
Ultramarine Lories have a gentle, squeaky, sibilant cry. The
flight is rather slow and heavy, though less so than that of
C. peruvianus , but they climb actively and spend a lot of time running
over the roof of the flight, upside down. They occasionally play
together, but less often than the other species. Now and again a
small spider is eaten. The hen is, and remains, a very nervous
bird, though her nerves do not affect her devotion to her egg or
young. The cock, on the other hand, is quite steady with people
he knows and will often let me go into the flight without rushing
into the shelter for refuge. The sexes of C. ultramarinus are much

alike, the male being slightly the larger. The wings, back, and tail
are a beautiful powdery blue of a rather unusual shade. The
breast and abdomen are largely white with some ultramarine spots
and markings ; a broad band of the same colour crosses the upper
breast, and there is ultramarine and turquoise on the crown.
The young bird has the bill and feet black and the white areas
on the breast and abdomen bluish black, with only a faint splash
of greyish white and a trace of the same colour behind the eye.

For many years I have always admired this most interesting
and beautiful bird from coloured plates, not having seen a live
specimen. People from districts where they are found invariably
say that they cannot be kept in captivity, that they have tried but
could not persuade the birds to feed. On these reports I had given
up hope of ever having a Bee-eater in the aviary.
On 2nd January I received a phone call at about 6 p.m. from a
Mr. Wheeler, saying that he had been out shooting with a friend
and had seen a bird disappear into the ground. His companion,
not knowing the nesting habits of Bee-eaters, would not believe
that a bird had gone into the ground, so they dug at the hole where
the bird had entered. After digging about 4 feet a nest containing
four young Bee-eaters was found, they were well feathered ; in
fact, two were able to fly and were liberated. The remaining two
were made comfortable in a box in the motor. Upon reaching
home, Mr. Wheeler became worried about feeding the birds,
so phoned me for advice. Taking me by surprise I did not know
what to tell him to do, my first thought was that they could not be
kept. I told him they were most difficult to feed, but to try hard-
boiled egg and white ants (these being plentiful in his district).
Half an hour later there was another ring, asking " would I take
the birds if he brought them down to me, as he was unable to get
them to feed Needless to say I was only too pleased to have the

opportunity to experiment with the keeping of these birds. I
immediately filled a hot-water bag and made a cosy nest in a box,
then mixed some Sugar-birds' food (Mellin's Food, condensed
milk, and honey), and cut up some mealworms. By this time the
birds arrived, looking rather sorry for themselves ; they were given
some of the above mixture with the aid of an eye-dropper, and then
tweezers were used to give them the pieces of mealworm, which
were pushed well back in the throat. That night they were given
two more feeds at hourly intervals and then tucked in beside
the water-bag for the night. The next morning they were quite
bright, and were fed in the same manner with the addition of
hard-boiled egg to the menu. A few days later we added mince-
meat moistened with water and rolled in dried flies. They were fed
five times a day. After about a week they commenced to pick the
food from the tweezers ; this made the feeding much simpler,
as we only had to pick it out of the dish for them. Feeding in this
way was continued for five weeks before they commenced to take
food from the dish ; this was encouraged by blocking the dish up
level with the perch.
Since the middle of January the Bee-eaters have been taken into
an aviary 20 ft. X 12 ft. X 6 ft. 6 in. high for exercise when the
weather was favourable. At first they were only left for a short
time ; later they were left out all day and taken in at night. Since
the beginning of April they have remained in this aviary altogether,
and always go in the house to sleep. They have become very tame
and fly all over you on entering the aviary. They are extremely
quick on the wing and are always looking for a mealworm ; if you
throw a mealworm and the bird happens to miss catching it the
first time, he flies down and catches it before it reaches the ground.
There is no doubt about their being fond of bees. For some weeks
numbers of bees have been flying over the aviary to some grapes
near by ; quite a lot of these bees find their way into the aviary
but are snapped up by the Bee-eaters immediately they are through
the netting. It is very amusing to see the birds sitting on a perch
watching the bees.
These birds are now nearly five months old, they are not fully
coloured and there is no sign of the elongated tail feathers. They
have never been seen to drink ; pellets about the size of a date-stone
are ejected.

Volume VI of the New Series of the Magazine commenced
in November, 1907, with a very nice coloured plate by Goodchild
of the Double-banded Courser {Rhinophilus bicinctus) of which
Captain Boyd Horsbrugh writes an interesting article. Sir William
Ingram records the breeding of the Roulroul Partridge (Rollulus
roulroul ), though the young were not reared to maturity. This is
a bird of the tropical jungle and its great beauty and natural
tameness should appeal to the aviculturist who possesses suitable
accommodation for its requirements. Sir William says, " the
female constructs a curious domed nest which is cunningly concealed
among the grasses and brushwood of the aviary. The dome is
considerably flattened with a small and proportionately low aperture.
It is constructed of dry grasses and fronds of dead palm leaves.
Once the female has completed her nest the male keeps as far as
possible from his partner's abode and leaves all the sitting to his
mate. She seldom leaves the nest and then only for a very short
time, always closing up the entrance during her absence."
A coloured plate by Herbert Goodchild of the American
Bluebird (Sialia sialis) is accompanied by an article from the pen
of C. William Beebe to whom the species was very familiar as a
wild bird. " To write an essay on the Bluebird," he says, " is like
attempting to describe the face of a dear friend ; it is so familiar,
so much of its charm has always been taken for granted, that it is
difficult to translate into definite words and phrases." In years
gone by this delightful bird which, " from its back reflects the
colour of the sky and from its breast, the earth," was freely imported
into Europe, but now it is rarely seen in aviaries owing to the
prohibition of its export. It breeds very freely in captivity though
requiring abundance of insect food in order to rear its young.
It was generally known here as the Blue Robin and even in the
wild state seems to be very robin-like in its choice of nesting sites.
Beebe records that " in Reading, Massachusetts, a pair of Bluebirds
built their nest in one of the signal balls near the railway station.

Here they successfully raised two broods of young, in spite of the
fact that the ball was lowered fifty times a day for the passing
trains. Every time it descended, the parents flew out and waited,
perching nearby or flying about impatiently, until the ball was
raised again, when they immediately returned to sit on the eggs
or cover the young as the case might be
A. G. Butler follows with an account of the Bluebird in captivity.
He had many nests but the great majority of the young died at
an early age. There were probably too many cats in his neigh-
bourhood to permit of his trying the method of liberating the
parents to find their own insect food, so successfully adopted since
those days of Dr. Amsler and others. Butler also contributes
an article on the Superb Tanager as an accompaniment to a very
good coloured plate of the species by Goodchild. Tanagers were
favourites of his and he writes, " if I had to restrict my avicultural
studies to one group of. insectivorous birds, I should certainly
choose the Tanagers : they are not only about the most lovely of
all cage-birds, but they are no great trouble to feed ; as a general
rule are quite friendly after the first moult in captivity, and, if in
good health to start with, are likely to live to a reasonably good
ageA
Collingham Ingram, writing on Oriental aviculture, describes
the method of feeding cage-birds in Japan. " The Japanese,' 5
he writes, " who are really skilled aviculturists, rely almost entirely
upon a specially prepared food which they seem to give with like
success to Warblers, Tits, Buntings, Robins, Thrushes, and, in
fact, to any bird that is either partly or wholly insectivorous.
The same recipe is, I believe, used in almost all parts of Japan,
and is as follows : A fresh-water fish (usually a carp) is first roasted
over a fire and afterwards thoroughly dried and then ground into
a fine powder which, by the way, is said to keep good for a long
time. To one part of this # fish-powder 5 is added two parts of
rice-bran and a small quantity of pulp from the cooked leaves of
a Japanese raddish. The whole is mixed into a soft paste with
a little water and is then ready for use." A beautiful coloured
plate of the Olive Finch (Phonipara lepida) accompanies an article
on the species by Reginald Phillipps who considered this " an
exceedingly nice little bird, neglected only because its merits are
not known ". Captain Stanley S. Flower writes on the Egyptian

Plover ( Pluvidnus a gyp tins) which is also known as the " Crocodile
Bird 55 from its reputed habit of entering the reptile's mouth and
pecking food from between its teeth. Of this he writes : " personally
I have carefully watched many hundred Nile Crocodiles, small,
medium, and large sized, basking on shore ; I have seen many
birds, Herons, Storks, Ibises, Spoonbills, Geese, Ducks, Plovers,
and Wagtails, close to and among the sleeping reptiles, but never
yet have seen a bird try to enter a crocodile's mouth or peck food
from it. It may possibly occur, but from my knowledge of the
habits of reptiles I would agree with Dr. Anderson that a crocodile
would not refrain from closing its jaws on a bird that entered its
mouth, even out of consideration for any service the bird might
be rendering it by catching vermin or cleaning its teeth."
The first arrival in this country of the Black-cheeked Lovebird
(.Agapornis nigrigenis) is recorded by Reginald Phillipps, while a
fine coloured plate of the species by Goodchild appears at the
end of the volume. The bird was discovered in North-West Rhodesia
in 1904 and described by W. L. Sclater in 1906 {Bull.
xvi, p. 61), and living specimens reached London in April, 1908.
It is a beautiful species which, like its near relatives A. per sonata
and A. jischeri , breeds freely enough in captivity, but, although
numbers were subsequently imported, it seems to have become
rather scarce since those days.
The rare Abbott's Rail (. Rallus abbotti ), from Assumption Island
in the South Indian Ocean, is the subject of a coloured plate by
Goodchild. Two of these handsome Rails were captured by Messrs.
Meade-Waldo and Nicoll during the voyage of the Valhalla and
safely transported to the London Zoological Gardens where they
lived for some years, probably the only specimens ever to leave
the island.
In 1906 Dr. Hopkinson brought from the Gambia a cock White-
bellied Amethyst Starling ( Pholidauges leucogaster ) which, apparently,
was the first specimen of this very beautiful species to be imported
to this country alive. It was presented to the Zoological Society
where it lived for some years. It is the subject of a very fine coloured
plate and an article by Dr. Hopkinson in the volume under review.
In December, 1907, at the request of the Council of the
Zoological Society, I paid a visit to Australia with the object of

animals. During my absence, Dr. A. G. Butler kindly took over
the editorship of the Magazine, and at the end of the 1908 volume

C. Barnby Smith records the successful breeding in his aviaries-
of the Partridge Tinamou ( Nothoprocta perdicaria ), one of a group
of highly interesting birds which one rarely hears of in private
collections now.
T. H. Newman contributes a very interesting article on the
nesting of the Patridge Bronze-wing Pigeon ( Geophaps scripta), a
charming species which failed to breed in my aviaries but did so
as soon as it was transferred to those of Mr. Newman, and its
breeding habits presented many points of especial interest.

Two well-known collectors arrived in London at the end of
June bringing many very beautiful birds, all well housed and in
wonderful condition. It is not often that we have the thrill of
seeing so many exquisite new arrivals all together, but Mr. Frost
and Mr. Shaw Mayer travelled from the East in the same boat.
This was fortunate because the latter was taken ill, just before
reaching home, and had to be taken to hospital on arrival. Mr. Frost
took charge of his birds and brought them with his own to the
London Zoo. A short note on these collections appeared in the

there was a pair of Molluscan Crimson Wings and Edwards,
Mitchells, the White-rumped and the Iris Lory, the last named a
first importation rather resembling Desmarest's but more subdued.
Of the three species of Mynas, Eulabes veneratus , of Flores, is
a very large kind not previously imported, and there were also
examples of E. intermedia , of India, and E. nigricollis , of China.
There were several examples of Rothschild's Grackle ( Leucopsar
rothschildi) , Bali, a lovely thing ; and from Celebes a curious
Shrike-Starling ( Scissirostrum dubium) , with yellow beak, grey body,
and waxy-like streaks of crimson on the upper tail coverts. Another
interesting importation was a baby Temmincks Blue Roller
(\0x25A0 Coracias temmincki ), from Celebes, and there were also some very
lovely Blue-vented Javan Kingfishers ( Halcyon cyanoventris) . Then
there were King Crows, Javan and Sumatran Cissas, Red Mesias,
Grey Longtailed Sibias, Scimitar Babblers, Yellow-headed Fruit-
suckers ( Chloropsis icterocephala) , Fairy Bluebirds, and the loveliest
little Van Hasseeti's Sunbird in finest condition.
There were quite a number of very taking Plover-like bird,
the Nile Courser or Crocodile bird ; a number also of a new
and very attractive little bird from Timor {Munia fuscata), much
resembling a dark form of Java Sparrow, having chocolate in
place of grey, and a blue, instead of a red bill. Another new
importation was Munia quinticolor, an almost red and white form
of Nun. A very dwarf form of Zebra Finch from Timor {T. insularis )
should also prove interesting and easy to breed. A Maleo, and some
specimens of Salvadore's Pheasant, concludes this fine collection.
Mr. Shaw Mayer's birds were superb--nine species of Birds of
Paradise, in finest show condition, a sight not to be forgotten !
Pride of place must, I think, be given to the Wahne's Six Plumed
(. Parotia wahnesi ), perfectly exquisite. Comparing it with other
Six Plumed, the long tail makes it more graceful, its head plumes
are considerably larger, and the gorget is wonderful, shot blue
on gold, in place of red on gold, and the larger nasal plumes are
bronze in place of silver. The female is lovely, too, bright reddish
brown, vermiculated with black. Almost equally thrilling was the
arrival of the rare Rothschild's Bird of Paradise ( Astrapia rothschildi ),
from N.E. New Guinea, and a near relative of the Princess Stephanie,
which has a graduated tail instead of two long feathers. The

Empress of Germany's Bird of Paradise (P. augusta-victoria), the
Lesser (P. minor), Count Raggi's Bird of Paradise (P. raggiana),
the Lesser Superb ( Lophorhina superha minor), a lovely Rifle Bird
(.Ptiloris intercedens), and some most perfect examples of the gem
Hunstein's Magnificent ( Diphyllodes magnificus hunsteini), completes
this wonderful array. Next we come to Mr. Shaw Mayer's greatest
triumph--the landing in finest show condition of a pair of Chestnut-
backed Eupetes {Eupetes pulcher), a task often attempted by others,
but never successfully accomplished. These are most lovely birds,
the size and shape of a Mocking-bird, but distinctly a ground bird ;
the whole body is a beautiful shade of smoke blue, back chestnut,
chin and upper throat snow white. The species appears to come
between the Dippers and Forktails ; it lives near water and has
the habits of a Wagtail.
There were two most attractive new Mountain Honey-eaters
found at an altitude of 6,000 feet. The large species especially,
was a dream bird, with dark body and yellow cheeks which
blushed crimson when the bird got excited ! There was a pair of
Dumont's Grackles ( Mino dumenti), with yellow cheeks, and two
species of lovely Pittas (P. baudi and P. cyanoptera), Blue-eyed
Cockatoos, Green-winged King Parrots, Musschenbroeck's Parrot,
and New Guinea Ravens.
Now we come to another triumph. The second importation of
the Monkey-eating Eagle, one of the largest and rarest of birds
of prey. This wonderful bird is now at Primley Park with
Mr. Whitley. Two Owls came in this collection, the Pagoda and
the Rose Owl, which is something like our own Barn Owl, but
with rose-coloured breast, and a slight difference in the face--
the Rose Owl appears to have a divided disc. Further, there were
two species of Kingfishers, the White-breasted and the Collared
Blue ; a number of the Bornean Black Nuns {Munia fuscus), and
some lovely Pheasants, Bulwers, Gray's Argus, Palawan Peacocks,
Chinguis Peacocks, Roul-roul Partridges, Longbilled Francolins,
Painted and Button Quail.
To conclude I will mention a most beautiful Javan Myna,
with plumage like satin, and yellow wattles which flap in a fascinat-
ing manner. The bird chants and talks in an Eastern language.
Our Secretary, Miss Knobel, is now the proud owner of this treasure,
and is very pleased with her newly acquired friend !

Some notes on the four pairs of Kelp Geese in Mr. Spedan
Lewis's collection at Leckford may be of interest.
Mr. Lewis purchased three adult pairs from Mr. Morrison
and was presented with an immature pair. They were brought
down from London on 29th April this year.
Before they came we had hunted through the earlier Avicultural
Magazines to find out how they should be fed in captivity and the
result was not encouraging. Heer Blaauw seemed to be the only
person who had kept any and his bird died when the supply of
kelp gave out. We made inquiries from the chemist about dried
kelp, which it was proposed to soak in salt water. Meanwhile
the Geese arrived. On the voyage and while in London they had
been fed on biscuit meal, kelp, and prodigious quantities of chopped
lettuce.
They were released in a small grass run containing a shelter
and I went off to find the head gardener. After a sympathetic
chat and having duly admired his treasures, I broached the
subject of lettuces and succeeded in getting fifteen. These were
chopped up and were completely finished immediately. Next
I tried biscuit meal soaked in sea-salted water, and this also was
a success. Elaborate arrangements were made with the market
gardener to supply thousands of lettuces, fortunately the drought
killed them before they grew up. For the next few days the lettuce
nightmare continued, then suddenly, realizing that they were
Geese, they started grazing and day by day took less interest in
their lettuce till finally we ceased to provide any.
The first night the Geese were shut up with two dishes of salted
biscuit, and when they were released in the morning we found to
our horror they had been bathing in their biscuit. As the day
was warm and sunny we let them have a quick bath in a stream
before the biscuit dried. They enjoyed it enormously and had to
be fished out, soaked through, and shut in their run. The weather
remained good and very quickly we got their plumage oiled up
again by allowing them regular, but very short, swims and after

a week they could be allowed constant access to the stream and
were no longer shut up.
The young pair were weak and at first were unable to flap
their wings, but from the day they came their health has caused no
worry. After they had been here almost a month the kelp arrived.
It was in a wooden barrel and proved to be as finely pulverized as
flour and smelt like a muddy sea-shore when the tide is out. We
now give a small handful of this mixed with the salted biscuit, but
it is probably unnecessary as the birds had already greatly improved
before it came.
The Kelp Goose, to my mind, is by far the most attractive of the
Chloephaga. The adult male is white with soft yellow legs and feet
and a black beak with a small flesh-coloured mark at the nostrils.
It is about the same size as the Ashy-headed Goose, but, being very
densely feathered, the bird has a more rounded and more kindly
appearance.
The adult female is nigger brown, darkest on the flanks and
palest on the head ; her rump, abdomen, and tail are white ; her
wings and shoulders as in the other Chloephaga ; her beak flesh and
feet as in the male. Her flanks are marked with zig-zag lines, rather
similar to the dark ones on the flanks of a female Magellan, except
that hers are white.
The young female is similar except that her flanks are more
finely barred, her abdomen dark and her rump and tail dark with
splashes of white. The young male has a similar colour scheme to
the male dispar and magellanica crosses one sees, except that his legs
and feet are yellow. The webbing of the feet and flanges on the
outside toes are very much more developed than in the other
members of the genus. They have a curious habit of doing Penguin-
like jumps from tussock to tussock or onto any perch or plank.
By nature they are completely fearless and at present gregarious,
although individually they are constantly squabbling rather in the
manner in which the individuals of a flock of feeding Starlings do.

I got a pair of these birds from the well-known collector, Mr.
Webb, when he brought them from Africa in May, 1937. They
were turned out in a large aviary with a good many other birds.
Last year they nested but only partially reared their young. On
the 30th May this year when the nest box, which was hanging
on the wall of their sleeping quarters about nine feet off the ground,
was examined, a nest was found containing two eggs about the
size of a house sparrow's egg. Colour of eggs a dull grey heavily
speckled with black spots. The nest was very simply constructed
with a few short pieces of dried grass. One young was hatched out
on 8th June, but the second egg had disappeared. The old birds
were never observed incubating nor feeding the young one, but
once or twice they were seen collecting meal-worms. The young
bird left the nest on 22nd June. Colour of the young bird--head
light brown, cheeks black and under part light brown heavily
speckled with dark spots. Wings--black with faint brown lines
across. Tail--light brown with the two central tail feathers black.
Legs and feet dark grey. The young bird is about the size of an
Amethyst starling, and about two-thirds the size of its parents.
On 29th June the young bird was observed on the food tray eating
insectivorous food. As far as I know this bird has never before
been bred in captivity.

By V. A. V. Carr
Noticing the lack of material on British birds I approached
the Editor and hence the result. My father has kept British birds,,
now, for over half a century, and long before the Buckmaster Act
he had bred many species. Since then, however, he has gone into
it a lot more thoroughly and the result is fifty-one breeding pens,
nearly all single units situated in a spinney covering an area of
about an acre. This site has its advantages and its disadvantages,
the latter being : insufficient sunlight penetrating through the
trees and the cursed danger of trees or limbs coming down on top
of the aviaries and letting the inmates out. On the other hand,
it is very sheltered and secluded and free to a certain extent of
Hawks and other predatory birds hovering above. Because of
these dangerous risks, I might add that the aviaries are none too
spectacular or finished off in elaborate details--but for all that
they have suited our purposes admirably.
Of the breeding of British birds in cages I know little so far,,
but another season we intend to try a few pairs that are severaL
generations aviary-bred and see what success can be achieved.
I have seen other fanciers breeding them in cages varying from
4 feet square to 4 feet long, and 18 inches wide, the birds including
Siskins, Goldfinches, Linnets, and bigger birds such as the Song
Thrush and Blackbird. These people ought to get greater praise
than those who are fortunate enough to possess sufficient ground
for bigger aviaries, as the amount of work and the varying foods
to keep these birds in the fine fettle that is essential for laying
of eggs must be enormous.
It is necessary to mention these facts to enable ornithologists
to realize how important it is to have the proper accommodation
in order to expect any success. The abode is of primary importance,
and when one has made the conditions as natural as possible one
can go into the feeding problems afterwards.
Some of the abodes we find most satisfactory, are 3 feet wide,
6 feet long, 6 feet high ; half boarded up, including the top half,
with two panes of glass at the bottom ends of the covered parts.
They are eminently suitable for two pairs of birds and are quite
inexpensive to construct.

-306 V. A. V. CARR-BREEDING BRITISH BIRDS
Another type of structure we use is 4 feet wide, 6 feet long,
and 6 feet high, protected in exactly the same manner as the
above and this will easily contain two pairs of British birds.
Another type of aviary we use, measuring 6 feet by 6 feet by
6 feet, is all wire with a shelter shelf all round the top, containing
easily three pairs of birds.
As regards suitable sites for British birds to nest in. The Hartz
Roller Canary travelling cages (made of all wood, including the
bars) are ideal, practically all species choosing them in preference
to anything else. We have had Bramblings, Chaffinches, Haw-
finches, Siskins, Redpolls, Canaries, and Greenfinches nest in
these sites successfully and if a few leaves are placed around and
a pane of glass placed on top, they will nest in such a place even
if it is exposed to the elements. Hedges, constructed with wooden
batons or wire netting, in the corners of the aviaries, and ever-
green bushes placed on top, covered by glass, also attract different
species with success.
This year we have had Bullfinches nest in evergreen bushes,
in artificial bushes, in wooden boxes, ordinary Canary nest-pans,
and in cup-shaped wire netting containers. Why there is this
difference in opinion as regards where to nest I cannot quite
fathom for they all have identical sites from which to choose.
Good bushes can be made by tying bunches of heather together
and then ramming one's fist into the centre. With the aid of some
evergreen, such as box, laurel or ivy an ideal site can be manu-
factured. But there is one thing that must be impressed and that
is :--Do not in any way restrict light from getting into nesting sites
as the parent bird is then unable to see the young birds' mouths
when feeding.
They will nest in a dark spot as well as a light one, it is true,
but they will not rear their young in a dark site.
Again, one must not expose nesting sites to any violent rain-
storms, or the youngsters are likely to be drowned or deserted.
Protection round the sides of the bushes one arranges in the
open is a good thing, but light must get in somewhere--either from
-,the top, or, alternatively, from the sides.

The Handbook of British Birds. Vol. III (Hawks to Ducks).
By H. F. Witherby, F. C. R. Jourdain, N. F. Ticehurst,
B. W. Tucker. Price 25s. Published by H. F. and
G. Witherby, Ltd., 326 High Holborn, London, W.G. 1.
In his foreword to this volume the Editor writes " Owing to
the peculiar fascination of ducks for ornithologists, aviculturists,
and sportsmen alike these birds have been very fully studied and
monographed 55 ; a statement which not in the least overestimates
the wealth of information contained in the following pages in
which this most interesting group of birds is dealt with from many
points of view. All the coloured illustrations of Geese have been
painted by Peter Scott which in themselves alone make a great
attraction. Maps showing the migration and breeding distribution
of various species of duck are a most valuable addition and most
interesting are the plates showing feathers from the nests of Ducks
and Geese which are a useful aid to the identification of the nests
of these birds. The assistance of Mr. Hugh Wormald on many
points in the preparation of the volume is acknowledged and other
members of the Avicultural Society who have contributed informa-
tion are Messrs. J. Delacour, J. G. Laidley, A. F. Moody, G. A.
Norris and D. Seth-Smith. It is certainly a volume no keeper of
waterfowl should be without.
No less admirable is the section on the birds of prey, the drawings
of birds in flight by G. E. Lodge and the diagrams by L. Tinbergen
being particularly helpful guides to identification. The plate of
the pellets of Hawks is a welcome addition. Storks, Herons, and
Swans complete this excellent volume. No ornithological library
whether public or private can be complete without this work,
and every aviculturist interested in the birds contained in Volume
III will find it of great assistance in many ways.

The Avigultural -Society of South Africa
With the publication of the first issue of their magazine, The Aviary , the
Avicultural Society of South Africa has at last, as the Editor states, fulfilled a
much needed want. Through the medium of this Magazine members will become
better acquainted with the workings of the Society, and it is hoped that the
public in general will take a greater interest in the activities of aviculturists in
South Africa. The first issue contains articles on the Zebra Finch (Taeuiopygia
castanotis) by W. Grei, giving useful information and advice on keeping, breeding,
and buying these birds ; on the Shama, by F. E. O. Mors, with a detailed menu,
varied for different days of the week, and an article entitled " Seven different
varieties of Doves I have bred in Captivity ", by W. A. Duncan, which should
be of particular appeal to all those interested in this group of birds. It is a pity,
however, that in the title the all too common mistake of confusing " species "
and " varieties " is made (see letter D. Seth-Smith, Avi. Mag., April, page 141),
as in this case the author certainly intends to refer to species. A letter from the
President, Mr. W. G. H. Zipp, outlines briefly the objects of the Society and
states that it has gone ahead tremendously and members are continually enrolling.
The publication of the journal, which is under the able editorship of Mr. Isidore
Lopis, the Hon. Secretary, should certainly help the Society to make even greater
progress, and best wishes for success to the magazine and congratulations on the
enterprise in its publication are accorded by the Avicultural Society in the
Mother-country.

THE SWIFT PARRAKEET
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992154115384616" page_id="56322958"  page_num="310" year="" vol="">
Although, according to A. J. North, in Nests and Eggs of Birds of Australia and
Tasmania, the Swift Parrakeet (or Lorikeet), Lathamus discolor, lays only two
eggs to each clutch, I have known instances among Swifts in captivity of clutches
of three, and this year in Dr. Derscheid's aviaries a hen laid four, all of which
hatched and were successfully reared.
I had not previously heard of these birds being double brooded, but this
same hen nested again in a similar log close by before the first four young had
left the nest, and laid three eggs, two of which hatched and the young are now
nearly ready to come out.
There are two pairs in the one aviary (which seems the best way to breed
them), but there is no doubt that all four eggs were laid by the same hen because
the second went to nest a week or two later, laying three eggs ; also, of course,
it is easy to see when the hens are about to lay because the eggs are large for
so small a Parrakeet.
According to A. J. Campbell, in Nests and Eggs of Australian Birds, the clutch
is two or three in Australia (" stated to be four to six in Tasmania "), but if the
young are fed largely on nectar from the flowers of Eucalypti, it seems likely
that broods of more than two would soon make the nests uninhabitable.
The young of Swifts are gentle and steady--a pleasant change from the
insane crashing about of most other young Parrakeets--and they are, to my

adult females.

The Argus form with the Peacock-Pheasants a specialized
group of Pheasants ; all are remarkable for the fact that they lay
a clutch of two eggs, never more, just like Pigeons. They are more
arboreal than most Pheasants. All have brown as their dominant
coloration, varied and elaborately patterned with different shades
of grey, russet, black and white. The Peacock-Pheasants, however,
also have metallic green or blue ocelloe and markings on their
wings and tails which the Argus lack, and are of a much smaller
size. In both one finds a genus with display in the vertical way,
spreading tails and wings in the same way as the Peacock (Argusianus
and Polyplectron) and others with narrower and compressed tails
which display sideways like a Silver Pheasant (Rheinardia and

Aviculture is a bond which knows no political differences and
is a link between the peoples of different nations which is hard
to be broken. The Avicultural Society, though a British organiza-
tion, is essentially international in its composition and has members
of many different nationalities and in every part of the globe,
brought together by a common interest.

utmost to avoid. It is not a war against a country, but a war against
a system which has already brought persecution, destitution, and
despair to countless members of the German nation itself.
During the months it has been my privilege to be the Editor of
the Avicultural Magazine I have considerably increased the
links with other nations, by means of exchange of publications with
scientific institutions and societies, and by requesting contributions
from aviculturists in other countries. It is my sincerest hope that
these new links, as well as the old, will hold, and though we are
now inevitably cut off from the German aviculturists, I feel sure
I am voicing the opinion of the majority of their colleagues in other
countries in saying that the friendly regard for them will remain
unchanged, and if they ever read these words they will know that
no bitterness is felt towards them or towards the German nation.
The present struggle is as surely for the salvation of Germany
as against her leaders.
The bonds between the Avicultural Societies in the great
British Commonwealth of Nations have always been close and
sincere, but the immediate response to the mother country's need
has united us even more surely. Backed by the Empire, Great
Britain with her staunch ally, France, by keeping their pledge to
valiant Poland, once more stand fast against the wreckers of the
peace of Europe.
The future is uncertain and obscure, but in the end right must
prevail. In the dark days that are before us we must never give
way to the inclination to assume that there is no future at all
and that all culture is lost for ever.
The Avicultural Magazine will continue so long as is
possible, and it shall be my utmost endeavour that it shall not fail.
Amongst the material in hand are some articles from German con-
tributors and these it is my intention to publish, although I cannot
submit the translations and proofs to the authors.
The efforts of the majority of people will be mainly concentrated
on some form of national service, but continuous work without
relaxation is not humanly possible. I hope, therefore, that members
w r ill endeavour to send me contributions for the Magazine, that
they will continue to support the Society, and that we may strive
not to lose the more beautiful and aesthetic side of life.

Many aviculturists who are called either to military or national
service are finding it difficult to provide for their collections of
birds, also those living in areas more vulnerable to air attack are
anxious to transfer their rarer birds to safer quarters. An urgent
appeal is made to all aviculturists to communicate with Mr. Seth-
Smith, Curator's House, Zoological Gardens, London, N.W. 8,
stating the number of birds they could take charge of in addition
to their own collection, the species they are able to cater for,
approximate charge, if any, best means of transport, nearest
railway station, and any other details. Similarly those who are
anxious for their birds to be cared for are requested to forward all
details of their needs. Every effort will be made to avoid collections
having to be split up and the proposed scheme of " transference "
will be systematically organized in order to avoid birds having to
travel greater distances than necessary.
Owners of birds are earnestly requested not to have their birds
destroyed without inquiry as to the possibility of their being suitably
cared for.
As far as can be ascertained the present stocks of bird foods
are adequate and immediate steps are being taken as to the possi-
bility of providing further supplies of insectivorous food in this
country. We are in consultation with the Editor of Cage Birds
and representatives of the Ornamental Pheasant Society, the Foreign
Bird League, and other kindred Societies, in order that all may work
together and that the closest co-operation in the efforts for the safe-
guarding of aviculture may be ensured. It is hoped thus that
both the arrangements for the care of the birds themselves and for
the supply of their food may be efficiently carried out, and that
the needless destruction of what in many cases represents the work
and efforts of years will be avoided.
This is a matter which concerns every member of the Avicultural
Society in the British Isles and they are earnestly requested to
come forward at once with offers of assistance and not to delay
under the mistaken impression that there will be sufficient without
their co-operation. In order to carry out the scheme effectively
a complete register of offers of help is the first step.

(Emberiza fiaviventris)
By Norman G. Allison
In September, 1937, I obtained a true pair of Gold-breasted
Buntings (.Emberiza fiaviventris ), and during that winter they were
housed indoors in a small flight. In the spring of the following
year they were turned out into a fairly small aviary inhabited by
a mixed collection of foreign and British Finches, but no attempt
whatever was made at nesting.
Before continuing this rather interesting breeding experience,
perhaps a rough description of this most attractive and inoffensive
Bunting would be appreciated. The adult cock is a handsome
fellow ; in size similar to the European Yellow Bunting, but of
rather a slimmer type. His back is a rich chestnut, wings black
edged with white and chestnut, and with a conspicuous white
shoulder patch ; tail feathers black with grey edges and the outer
feathers tipped white ; under-surface pure yellow with a distinct
orange chest ; head, black with a fairly wide stripe of white
extending from beak over centre of head, and also a white stripe
over each eye and another below the eye crossing the ear-coverts.
The hen is similar but her colour areas are more subdued, and the
stripes on the head are considerably tinged with brown.
This particular pair are delightfully tame, readily taking
mealworms from the fingers. They are partial to plain canary
seed, eating little else, although insectivorous mixture has been
provided.
In the early part of this year they were again turned out into
the same aviary, although this is now situated in a London garden,
ravaged with cats and strong winds, and entirely unsuitable for
the successful breeding of foreign Finches. However, towards the
end of May both birds were seen to be carrying small twigs and
pieces of dried grass, but as far as I can tell the hen actually con-
structed the nest. This was built in a rack of dried grass about
4 feet high, and the hen laid her first egg on the 3rd June. She only
laid two eggs, which were pale blue spotted and scrawled in a
complete circle round the larger end with purplish-brown. The

first youngster hatched on the 14th June, the other following the
next day. These were covered in white down. The next difficulty
was to supply live food, which in London is not easily procured.
At this period gentles seemed unobtainable so cut mealworms
were offered, and also any other insects that could be trapped or
scrounged. The supply, however, obviously was not large enough,
for in addition to the Buntings every other bird in the aviary
decided that live food was just what they desired, and on the 16th
June both youngsters were found to be cold and badly in need of
food and attention. In sheer desperation, therefore, I transferred
them to a hen Border Canary, whose eggs were infertile. She
kept them going for a further two days, but on Sunday, 18th June,
both were dead. At this juncture, perhaps I should mention that
so far as I could see the hen Bunting was feeding for at least two
days from the crop, although the cock carried numerous live insects
in the beak, which he fed to the hen on the nest.
The hen went to nest again in the same situation and laid her
first egg on the 23rd June, followed by her second on the next day.
These hatched on the 4th and 5th July respectively, so it will be
seen that incubation lasts eleven days exactly.
After the failure of our first attempt, we decided that we would
go all out to succeed in breeding probably the first Gold-breasted
Bunting reared in this country. Arrangements were, therefore,
made to procure a supply of live gentles every other day, and these
were provided in a flat tin about four times daily, together with a
plentiful supply of cut mealworms. Live ants 5 eggs were also
provided, but these latter were ignored after a few days.
Towards the end of the first week I became very alarmed and
; extremely surprised to find that the hen Bunting, in addition to
caring for her own youngsters, was also busily engaged in feeding
four healthy Black-headed Siskin X Canary Hybrids which were
being reared by their mother hen Canary quite near to the
Buntings' nest. It was a surprising sight to see the young Mules
being fed with live gentles and cut mealworms, and at first I
wondered how they would fare. However, they much appreciated
this altered menu, but my consternation grew when it became
apparent that the Bunting would only feed her own youngsters
after she was quite satisfied that the Mules had had sufficient.
These Mules were considerably older than the young Buntings.

310 N. G. ALLISON-BREEDING THE GOLD-BREASTED BUNTING
I therefore decided on the gth July to take the Canary away,
together with her youngsters, and place them in a cage in the
bird-room. I thought this arrangement would enable the Bunting
to concentrate her efforts on her own youngsters, but I was dis-
illusioned. Within an hour I found both babies thrown out of the
nest. One was dead, but the other appeared to have a spark of
life left, and by breathing on it in my hands I eventually succeeded
in bringing it back from the Gates of Beyond. The hen Canary
and her family were again returned to the aviary and the young
Bunting to its nest where it continued to thrive, and I have a
note that on the nth July (seven days after hatching) its eyes
were open and the breast had commenced to feather in addition
to the wing quills breaking.
On the morning of the 15th July, i.e. eleven days after hatching,
it was quite apparent that the hen Bunting had finished feeding,
and I attribute this to the fact that the young Mules had left the
nest and she was far more anxious about their welfare than she
was of rearing this little rarity. My wife, deeply appreciating
my keen disappointment and in sympathy with its sorry plight,
volunteered to try her luck at hand-rearing. With some degree
of persuasion it was fairly easy to get it to gape and then pop cut
mealworms and gentles into its beak. No regular feeding times
were decided upon, but whenever anybody passed food was offered.
In order to give artificial heat the chick was placed in an ordinary
Canary nest-pan with felt lining, which in turn was placed on a
hot-water bottle in a cardboard box surrounded with pieces of
flannel. This worked very satisfactorily and the chick thrived,
although my wife found that a daily drop of cod-liver oil and water
proved beneficial, inasmuch as this seemed to keep its motions
in correct order. In addition, as it was seen that the hen Bunting
had previously dipped cut mealworms into a jar of grit before
feeding, we decided that we would follow Nature as much as possible,
so at least once daily a few cut mealworms were dipped in a jar
of sand and fed with the particles of sand adhering. It was noticed
if this was not done several gentles passed completely through the
chick still alive. When I first saw this I could hardly believe my
eyes, but it was certainly a fact.
Apart from one or two scares in the shape of it refusing to feed,
the hand-rearing did not present any great difficulty, and I am

happy to report that it is now (14th August) quite independent,
and feeding lustily on my own insectivorous mixture and cut
mealworms twice daily, the gentles having been discontinued.
I believe it to be a cock, and in coloration he is a subdued edition
of his mother. At twenty-one days he was running strongly on the
bottom of an all-wire cage to which he had been transferred, and
was attempting to pick for himself. At twenty-seven days he was
eating and drinking.
The above is rather a detailed report of this hand-rearing,
and is given for the benefit of any member who may be tempted
to hand-rear Buntings, as I have no doubt that the method success-
fully adopted in this case would prove equally successful in rearing
other Buntings. It will be interesting to know if this is the first
instance of breeding the Gold-breasted Bunting in captivity in this
country.

THE BROWN PADDA OR RICE BIRD

this bird living, which I had not and I was pleased to be able
recently (July, 1939) to do this and add it to my collection.
Most people know that Viellot described and figured the
Brown Rice Bird in Oiseaux Chanteurs , 1805, and that when vol. xiii
B.M.C. Birds was compiled apparently five skins were in the
collection, viz. : one E. Timor, one Semao Timor, one Timor
Coupong (Wallace Collection), one Gould (Timor Wallace), and
one Timor (Forbes Collection), see p. 330 with the usual references

1850, 1861, 1863, 1870, 1874, 1879, last Russ Stubenr (Magde-
burg, 1879). Vol. i, p. 142, apparently refers to the instance (by a
Mr. Beretta) of the species being on sale at 100 francs a pair. It
was, however, a case of mistaken identity.
Figures of this species by F. W. Frohawk may be found in a
Monograph of the Weaver Birds (1888), by Edward Bartlett, whom
I knew many years ago as Curator of Maidstone Museum.
The description of the colour of the eyelids and bill in this
work is erroneous, as these are livid and not the conspicuous
pinkish feature as in P. oryzivora, the Grey Rice Bird or Java
Sparrow. Regarding this Bowdler Sharpe was more careful and
does not describe the colour of these areas.
The species differs from the other member of its genus in
having a leaden bill shaded lighter at the cutting edges, darkest on
top and at the lower sides of the under mandible, eyelids leaden.
Feet dirty whitish with a smoky wash at sides. Eyes so dark brown
as to appear black. Upper parts, dark snuff brown, lower throat,
sides of neck, fore neck, and upper breast similar in colour. The
white of the under-parts is separated from the brown of the chest
by a band of black, the edges of these feathers being irregular and
showing a little of the white under-parts between their tips. A
white area is made up by feathers below the eye embracing the
cheeks and ear coverts. Crown to nape dusky black merging into
the brown of the nape. Chin and upper throat black ; in both
cases most dense near the bill. The plumage is close and has a
noticeable sheen in good lights. Quills brownish black externally
most brown. Tail blackish. Size slightly less than that of the Java
Sparrow. Bill in the male not so swollen or broad as in that species,
but there appears to be about the same sexual guides. The call
note is very like, but quite distinguishable from that of the common
bird. I have both flying in aviaries apart and can detect which
are calling without looking.
It is to be hoped that Mr. Frost will contribute a few notes
as to the kind of country (whether forest, open, or cultivated) in
which the birds were observed and, if nesting, particulars of the site,
nest, etc., about which little appears to be known.
My own pair already occupy at night a pailful of hay stuffed
in an old empty wire cage but one can hardly expect such recent
arrivals to think about house-keeping.

By R. R. Minchin, Director
Our records show that during the year ended 30th June last,
222 birds of 44 different species were reared in the Gardens and
this does not include numerous Budgerigars and a few hybrids.
Possibly the most outstanding achievement was the breeding of
the Brush Wattle-bird (. Anthochara chrysoptera) which we understand
is a first record, and only about the fourth species of Honey-eater
to be bred in captivity.
The following, from our point of view, were the most interesting

these wonderful birds and it is our ambition to rear fifty in one
season !
Turquoisine Parrakeet [Neophema pulchella). Two reared.
Pileated Parrakeet ( Purpureicephalus spurius). Three reared.
The parents were housed in an aviary together with seven or
eight others of their kind. No fighting took place as might have
been expected, but no intruders were allowed near the log.
Red-collared Lorikeet ( Trichoglossus rubritorquis) . Two reared.
In this instance also, several other Red-collareds, two Blue-
mountains and a pair of Scaly-breasted Lorikeets were in the same
cage, so the breeding pair by no means had the place to them-
selves. The food provided for our Lorikeets consists of bread
and milk sweetened, and fruits such as pears, grapes, and apples.
Brown's Parrakeet ( Platycercus venustus). Four reared. As is
usual, these birds nested during our winter and the young have
only been out of the log for about four weeks. The cock still feeds
them occasionally and the hen has laid again and is incubating
at the time of writing (ioth July, 1939).
Brown Quail ( Synoicus australis). Six reared.
Banded Rail (Hypotanidia philippensis) . Four reared. The
parents were accommodated in an aviary some 35 ft. by 25 ft.
wide and three other Banded Rails were in with them besides a
number of Banded Plover (#. tricolor ) and several kinds of Ducks.
A cup-shaped nest was built in some coarse grass growing near
a cement pond. Four eggs were laid and when they hatched the
young remained close to the nest for about ten days before they
ventured forth into the open. Prior to nesting their diet consisted
of raw mince-meat, grain, and green food in the form of lettuce.
The young ate a little hard-boiled egg crushed up with biscuit-
meal and chopped lettuce, but we think that the parents fed them
mainly on flies which conveniently congregated around the meat
dish. It was interesting to watch one of the old birds literally
stalk a fly and having made a catch, return to the youngsters and
hand it to them.
Brush Wattle-bird (. Anthochara chrysoptera) . One reared. The
nest was a cup-shaped structure placed some 9 feet from the ground
in a banana passion-fruit vine which was growing over a trellis.
We think that only one egg was laid, but even had we desired
to do so, it would have been next to impossible to look into the

nest without making a disturbance. At any time these Wattle-birds
are inclined to make a nuisance of themselves in an aviary by
attacking the other occupants, but during the time that they were
nesting they were furiously pugnacious. However, nothing could
have been done to avert this as the aviary in which they bred is
a very large affair made entirely of half-inch netting and measuring
46 ft. by 26 ft. by 24 ft. high, also it is fairly thickly planted with
trees and shrubs, so it would not have been an easy matter to
remove the smaller kinds of Honey-eaters that shared the aviary
with them.
The staple diet of all our Honey-eaters is a simple mixture of
one large teaspoonful of honey to one cupful of water and besides
this they are given soft fruits such as pears and grapes. Brush
Wattle-birds, together with others of the larger Honey-eaters will
eat a little soft-bill food which is always before them and is also
enjoyed by the Crakes and Masked Plovers which are in the cage.
The actual mixture provided consists of
1 lb. Pea-flour. 1 lb. Oatmeal.
ijr lb. Beef dripping. 1 lb. Dog biscuits (containing meat meal).
^ lb. Honey. 10 per cent, by weight wheat germ.
When the above are thoroughly mixed they form a dry crumbly
mass containing a certain number of lumps which we remove by
putting the lot through a mincing machine. It is extremely doubtful
whether the Wattle-birds fed their young one on this item of diet,
but they certainly eat a little of it themselves. As a matter of fact,
it was so difficult to follow the movements of the old birds in this
large aviary that we are unable to say exactly what the young
bird was fed on, but it was certainly given insects for the parents
were often observed catching them on the wing and returning
to the nest. In such a large cage it would have been quite possible
for them to have caught enough insects to feed a single young one.
Meal-worms were given very sparingly as at that time we were
short of them and other more valuable and newly imported birds
were in greater need of them.

TWO BEAUTIFUL BIRDS
THE SCISSOR-TAILED FLYCATCHER
(Muscivora tyrannus)
AND
THE RESPLENDENT TROGON
(.Pharomacrus mocinno)
By James B. Housden
On my first visit to Mexico I found in New York Zoo gardens
a friend whom I had known years before in London now in

charge of the Bird House there. He gave me a great deal of informa-
tion about the birds of Texas and N. Mexico, and told me to look
out for two birds especially, the Scissor-tailed Flycatcher (or
Fork-tailed Tyrant) and the Resplendent Trogon.
The first-named bird arrives in Texas about the middle of
March, and returns to its winter home in Central America in
October. I reached Southern Texas in March. There is no
denying the beauty of this bird, which would well entitle it to the
admiration of all bird lovers and is certain to be noticed wherever
it goes. The long centre tail feathers it can open and close at will.
Its appearance is most pleasing to the eye, when fluttering slowly
from tree to tree uttering its twittering notes " Spee-spee
When chasing each other in play or anger these birds have a harsh
note.
Extensive timber land is shunned by this Flycatcher : it prefers
more open country, though it is often seen on the edges of woods.
The first two I saw were flying in the open road and expanding
the two outer tail feathers ; they looked very beautiful. Its social
disposition is observed in the fact that several pairs will breed close
to each other in perfect harmony, but they are rather noisy.
I was visiting a friend on the border of the city of San Antonio
S. Texas, and found he had several pairs nesting in a mesquite
tree. After dark they became very noisy and quite a nuisance ;
he took a long pole and drove them away to another tree, and was
amused when I told him I should like to have a nuisance of the
same kind near my house in the Homeland.

J. B. HOUSDEN-TWO BEAUTIFUL BIRDS 323
Many years ago I bought a case of very beautiful birds at
Stevens's Sale Rooms (the Resplendent Trogon). I think I had
never seen anything more beautiful. Of all birds there are
few which excite so much admiration as the male " Quetzal ",
the Mexican name. I tried in every way to get all the information
I could before I went to Mexico. I visited the South Kensington
Museum and found all the specimens there came from Mexico
(they were old specimens). I was not successful in finding any of
the Quetzals, but found a report from Vera Paz from a traveller in
Guatemala. He writes : " My companions are ahead, and Filipe
comes back to say that they have heard a Quetzal. Of course,
being very anxious to watch one of these birds myself, I immediately
hurry to the spot. I have not to wait long. A distant clattering
noise indicates that the bird is on the wing. He settles--a splendid
male--on the bough of a tree only a few yards from where we are
hidden. It sits almost motionless on its perch, the body remaining
in the same position, the head only moving from side to side.
The tail is occasionally jerked open and closed again, and now
and then slightly raised, causing the long tail coverts to vibrate
gracefully. I have not seen all. A ripe fruit catches the Quetzal's
eye and he darts from his perch, plucks the berry, and returns to
his former position. A low whistle calls the bird nearer, the first
Quetzal I have seen."
I have never been so fortunate as to meet with this beautiful
bird in the wilds of Mexico or elsewhere ; and I have only met one
white man who has seen it in Santa Cruz. This gentleman I met in
a most strange way. During the War I was serving in the army at
Victoria Station; there I met with an officer who before the War
was a butterfly collector in the West Indies, Mexico, and other parts
of Central America, and learned he visited one of these parts every
spring. I saw at his home near here his beautiful collection of
butterflies. This is the only person I have met who has seen
this bird (either white or coloured). He told me one afternoon he
was very fatigued and lay down in the shade and went to sleep.
He was awakened by the cry of a strange bird and saw one of the
most beautiful birds in creation, a male Quetzal, which flew
quickly away.
Some months since I saw a live Quetzal at the Zoo, brought
home by a lady.

THE GREY-NECKED BUNTING
(.Emberiza buchanani)
By Godfrey Davis

" merchant ", descended on me with a basketful of nestling Ring-
neck and Alexandrine Parrakeets and a cageful of Buntings.
In March we had had the usual fall of spring rain and one of
my peons who takes an interest in birds told me big flocks of
Buntings would be coming in. They are returning on migration
to more temperate countries ; and here were some of the poor
migrants. There were Black-headed Buntings for which, I suppose,
one should not be sorry as the flocks commit such havoc in the
grain fields, but in spite of that they are beautiful, if uninteresting
birds, with their lovely deep yellow breasts, their black heads, and
the upper plumage a deep orange chestnut. The hens were almost
as modest in their colouring as hen Sparrows. But besides the
Black-headed Buntings there were some other Buntings which
I thought at first to be Grey-headed Buntings, but I found on con-
sulting Blandford's Fauna of British India they were Grey-necked
Buntings. According to Blandford the Grey-headed Bunting is
a Himalayan species and is not generally found in the plains
of India in winter. Moreover, the colouring given was not the
colouring of my birds ; and according to Blandford the Grey-
necked Bunting is a winter visitor to the whole of the north-
western portion of the plains of India, and that includes Sind,
and our Indian birds probably summer in Turkestan and Persia.
These Buntings were smaller than the Black-headed Buntings, were
finer in build in every way, and seemed far less reconciled to

captivity. They squatted on the floor of the cage, their feathers
puffed out, snapping with their beaks at other birds which came
near. But they were pretty birds with their tawny reddish breasts,
which Blandford describes as rufous, and a light yellow ring round
the eye was most conspicuous, though Blandford calls it fulvous.
He also says the birds have an indistinct black moustachial streak,
but the colour of this appeared to me to be more of a dark olive,
leaving two well-marked patches of yellow or I should say, I suppose,
fulvous on the chin. But yellow or fulvous they were pretty birds
with their grey necks and heads, a patch of rufous also upon the
wing, reminding me of Redwings, and their slender tails, the outer
feathers of which were white and reminding me in their slenderness
of a Wagtail, but not, of course, as long. I therefore took those
two Buntings from Nazir Mahomed and put them both in separate
cages because I have found that wild birds do better if each one is
in a separate cage (I am not, of course, referring to tiny things such
as Avadavats which like company), rather than two or more in a
larger cage where they worry each other with their movements. I
use a very simple cage for taming the smaller birds. It is 22 inches
long by 11 inches wide and 11 inches high with two perches
resting upon the wooden bar 4 inches up from the wooden base of
the cage and doors at each end and one at the side. It is an all
wire cage with the usual wooden framework through which the
wires pass ; the bottom also is of wire with wooden bars, and
there is a wooden base 2 inches high along the sides and at each
end to protect the bird from the wind. It is a cage handy in size to
move and to clean. When the tray is removed and the cage is placed
upon the ground under the shelter of a wall or bush, protected
from the wind yet accessible to the morning sun, I find a wild
bird soon cheers up and if insectivorous may find insects on the
ground on which the cage is resting, and, if a seed-eater, pecks at
the seeding grass which protrudes through the wires at the bottom
of the cage, when the cage is placed upon a patch of seeding grass.
So I treated my Grey-necked Buntings in this way, but one
seemed ill with what, I suppose, the experts would call enteritis
and which, I believe, comes from fright or shock or chills or
improper food. So one of my peons caught grasshoppers and
every morning dropped some of these, having been well
pinched to keep them quiet, in the cages. The Buntings

would take them one by one, bang the larger ones on the floor
of the cage as the Thrush bangs a snail on a stone, and eat them
with every sign of satisfaction. The one that was not so well was
given at first the tiny grasshoppers which could be swallowed at
one gulp. It was also given maw or poppy seed which I find valuable
in such cases. Both birds I found preferred paddy or unhusked
rice and the lesser millet or bajri, a little grey-green seed about which
I have written, to any other seed. I was told that Grey Buntings
and the Black-headed Buntings were caught in nets under which
bajri had been spread.
Soon the Bunting that was well began to sing. I think it must
be the cock as its plumage is brighter all over than the other and
when the sun shines on his breast, it looks almost red, though not
the carmine of the Linnet.
His song was a typical Bunting song ; not, indeed, with the long-
drawn note of the Yellow Bunting yet the same homely and not
unpleasing sound. It reminds one of a hot summer day with the
countryside drowsing in the summer sun. It is a short song of
six notes, three, if I may say so, beginning his song and three ending
it. In some of its ways the Grey-necked Bunting reminds me of a
Chaffinch and of a Hedge-Sparrow, a Chaffinch in the way it erects
its crest and of a Hedge-Sparrow in the way it moves and generally
in its modest plumage and modest song, though it is somewhat
daintier in its ways and has a slender tail. It seems essentially a
bird of a temperate zone, a wanderer but for a brief space in
Hindustan.
Blandford in his Fauna says little about these birds because per-
haps it is so little known, but I have found them pleasant little birds
ready to sing their homely little song time and again in the mornings
and in the evenings, becoming tame in little more than a month
and content with a frugal diet of bajri the lesser millet, and paddy,
unhusked rice and grasshoppers. How useful are grasshoppers to
the bird-keeper, but how difficult to catch as one grows old.

Volume VII of the New Series (November, 1908, to October,
1909) commences with a good coloured plate by Goodchild of
the King Bird of Paradise ( Cicinnurus regius), accompanied by an
article from the pen of Mrs. Johnstone. At that time Walter
Goodfellow was collecting for this lady and was the first to introduce
this species, as well as many others, to aviculture. Mrs. Johnstone
noticed, what others have observed since, that when in an aviary
the cock King Bird, when in colour, is very fully aware of his
conspicuous appearance and " the instant he realizes he is being
watched, there is a flash of crimson and he is gone ", but the
brown-coloured hen " does not in the least mind being watched ".
Curassows have not bred in the Zoo on many occasions, but in
1908 a male Crax globicera mated with a female of the so-called
Heck's Curassow (C. hecki ), a bird with barred plumage which is
undoubtedly only a mutation of C. globicera. Their nest-building,
mating, and rearing a chick is described in an article by R. I.
Pocock, which is illustrated with a line-drawing by Goodchild of
the hen feeding the chick. Mr. Pocock concludes by drawing
attention to the following facts connected with the nesting of
</bodyText>

these birds :--
1. The nest is built in a tree and consists of twigs.
2. The hen does not build it but leaves this task to the cock.
3. The latter takes no share in incubation, nor, so far as is known, in brooding
or feeding the chicks. After making the nest his part in domestic affairs appears
to be restricted to the expulsion of intruders.
4. The eggs, two in number, are white and rough.
5. The incubation period is twenty-eight days.
6. The wings of the newly-hatched young have distinct flight feathers which
grow very rapidly.
7. The chicks leave the nest and follow the mother to the ground the first
day after hatching.
8. She broods them on the ground for a few nights and at intervals during

the day. After this they spend the nights perched by her side on a branch well
above the ground, reaching their position by climbing.
9. They feed at first upon insect food and afterwards take to the diet of their
parents.
10. For several weeks they do not peck food from the ground but take it
from their mother's beak, at ten weeks old they feed themselves and are also fed
by her.

328 D. SETH-SMITH-EARLY YEARS OF AVIGULTURAL SOCIETY
The late Heer F. E. Blaauw kept, for many years, a grand
collection of living birds, as well as a few mammals, at Gooilust,
Holland, and in this volume he describes the breeding of some of
his birds in 1908. Wattled Plovers ( Sarciophorus pectoralis ) reared
a pair of young, as did his Emerald Doves ( Chalcopelia chalcospilos ),
the young of this African species " when still in the nest, feel a
cold, wet day very much and often die if the sun is obscured too
long He found Turtur humilis , the Dwarf Turtle-dove, " the
most prolific and most successful breeder of all the exotic doves."
Ten chicks of Gallus sonneratti were successfully reared and proved
to be five cocks and five hens. The first two clutches were reared
under a bantam, while the Sonneratt hen herself hatched and
reared the third. Amongst Waterfowl, for which Gooilust was
celebrated, Golden-eyes, Orinoco, Ashy-headed, Ruddy-headed,
and Sandwich Island Geese reared young.
An account, by Dr. O. Heinroth, of his successful breeding of
the Nightjar is quoted from The Field. A pair of these birds " were
kept in a large cage during the night and morning, but allowed
the free flight of Dr. Heinroth's study or dining-room during the
rest of the day. Pairing took place at the end of May and the
male commenced to form a nesting-place on an peccary-skin rug
in the dining-room, by twisting round and round and scraping
with his feet. Eggs were laid on the 2nd and 4th June, the female
sitting well, her place being taken by the male when she left to
obtain food. Incubation lasted 16J days, both eggs hatching
successfully. The young were fed by both parents by the latter
inserting their bills as far as the nostrils into those of the chicks.
Both young were successfully reared as were a second brood of
two, hatched in July". Surely an astonishing achievement.
C. Barnby Smith contributes some very interesting notes on the
Rock Ptarmigan ( Lagopus rupestris) , and the Harlequin Duck,
while Sir William Ingram contributes an account of the first
specimen of Prince Rudolph's Bird of Paradise to reach this country.
That some of the Birds of Paradise are capable of withstanding
a considerable amount of cold is proved by Mrs. Johnstone's
experience with a hen New Guinea Rifle Bird ( Craspedophora
intercedes) which escaped from its cage in the autumn of 1908
and was not recaptured for ten weeks. Mrs. Johnstone writes :
" We have had 17 decrees of frost and cold, wet nights, and for

ten weeks this bird has lived in the woods and is apparently none
the worse. After this I think we over coddle our Paradise Birds,
and next year I believe they could be wintered in a cold aviary
without heat. This bird was freshly imported and had been caged
for months before it escaped."
A coloured plate of the Waxwing and another of the egg of
this species accompanies an article by W. H. St. Quintin. He
never quite succeeded in breeding these birds successfully, but the
egg figured was the first and is probably even now the only one
ever laid in captivity. Mrs. Reid contributes an article on the
breeding of the African Grey Parrot in captivity in Madeira.
The nest was in a small barrel fixed on its side inside a box, open
in front and high up in one corner of the aviary. On the bottom
of the barrel was a good thick layer of sawdust and, before laying,
the hen covered this with soft down which she took from her breast.
" On the 3rd August the pair of birds were noticed to be feeding
each other and very affectionate. I therefore began using much
lime, old mortar broken up, and cuttle fish bone, which was grated
all over their food. On the 6th a nice sound egg was laid ; on the
8th a second ; after an interval of five days a third. The hen sat
steadily from the very first, only leaving the nest for fifteen minutes
in the morning, generally bathing then, and for another ten
minutes in the evening before sunset. The male bird fed her
constantly and most regularly and was extremely good and devoted.
On the 6th September a chick was hatched ; on the 7th another ;
and the third chick did not come out till five days later, when
I was beginning to feel sure the third egg was bad." The birds 5
normal food was Indian corn soaked for twenty-four hours, then
well washed and given damp ; also hemp seed with a sprinkling
of canary and millet and a spoonful or two of rice, tapioca, or
any other milk pudding that was going, with plenty of ripe banana
of which they were very fond. For the first fortnight the parent
birds fed the young on soft food only, but later gave much hemp,
some canary, or millet and ground monkey nuts. The youngest
chick was neglected by the parents and died, when it was found
to be deformed. The other two were very strong, healthy birds,
but did not begin to come out of the nesting log until the middle
of December.

event, but this may be partly due to the fact that males seem to
be very scarce, and few people keep more than single individuals ;
but under proper conditions there should be no great difficulty
in breeding them in this country.
Hugh Wormald writes on the Californian Quail and illustrates
his article with some delightful drawings of this lovely species in
its various attitudes. He recommends this bird as " very hardy,
readily tamed, easily kept, and an extraordinarily prolific breeder ".
But unless kept in a very large aviary the young are best reared
by bantams, the best type, according to Mr. Wormald, being a
cross between the Jungle Fowl and Silkie. A single hen Californian
Quail in his aviary laid an egg a day from the 3rd April, only
missing three days, until she had laid 144 eggs, very nearly all of
which were fertile.
Aubyn Trevor-Battye gives a delightful account of his Great
Bustards, birds of which he was particularly fond. He was a great
naturalist as was his cousin Edmund Meade-Waldo, and they
loved the country and its wild life. What can be more charming
than Trevor-Battye's note on the Water Rail.--" If you put on
your best protective resemblance clothes, have no white linen
showing, sit down in the likeliest place and remain quite still, then
you have a chance [to see one]. Should you be fortunate you will
before long notice here and there a bit of grass or reed close to
the water moving a little, and then may catch momentary glimpses
of a small object threading about through the runs in the herbage.
If you did not know the Rail and its ways you might easily take
this for a water rat. As the day wears on the Rails begin to cry or
call, and you will seldom have heard in the stillness of a summer
evening a more startling sound. The voice of the Water Rail is
amazing in volume and variety, out of any proportion to the size
of the bird. It is quite impossible to attempt to phrase it syllabically.
There are squeals, sometimes with a shiver in them, there are
gurgles, and there are grunts."
W. E. Teschemaker records the successful breeding of the
Cinnamon Tree Sparrow (Passer cinnamomeus) for the first time in
the British Isles, and T. H. Newman supplies an excellent article,
which is illustrated by a coloured and two black plates, on the
breeding of the handsome Bartlett's Bleeding-heart Pigeon. An

This attractive little Finch was, as far as I am aware, first
imported in 1937. A considerable number came over, suggesting
that the species is not rare in its habitat--though possibly markedly
local.
I pointed out in these pages that the British Museum description
is inaccurate in that the sexes are described as similar.
In point of fact, the male and female are distinguishable to the
most casual of observers. The male is a study in black, or very
dark brown on a groundwork of grey ; in the female the blacks

are replaced by a rusty brown, and she has no dark " chin " patch.
The crest is equally well developed in both birds--but the above
sexual colour distinctions apply to the crests also. In size this little
Finch is about as large as a Great-Tit, but much resembles the
Crested-Tit in coloration and outline. This especially applies
to the female, but here the similarity ends ; these birds have all
the staid demeanour of a true Finch and never indulge in the
acrobatics common to the paridce. Last year my birds attempted
to nest but I only discovered this on finding an exquisitely built
cup-shaped nest built in a large Weigelia (now known as Diervilla).
I had no idea that such recherche building materials existed in my
aviaries--the outer part of the nest was composed of a mixture of
lichen and fine moss, inside this a layer of fine grass or hay, and
finally a lining of very fine fibre of some sort. The whole nest
was a minute affair about 2 inches in diameter externally, the
cavity being little more than 1 inch across. This may be accounted
for by the fact that these birds apparently only lay two, or possibly
three, eggs. In the October number of the Avicultural Magazine
for 1938 Mrs. Cholmeley describes a partial success in the breeding
of these birds but it will be seen that I am not in agreement with
her as to the colour of the eggs or of the young chick when first
hatched. The colour of eggs, however, is known to vary greatly
in the same species.
My birds spent last winter in a large cage containing a mixed
collection, chiefly Grass Finches, and enjoyed a little heat, the
temperature seldom falling below 45 0 . They were quite inoffensive
in this cosmopolitan crowd and were turned out into a large and
well planted aviary in April.
By 6th May a nest had been completed and contained two eggs,
rather globular in shape, size 10 mm. by 7 mm. Their ground
colour was a greyish white with the minutest of evenly distributed
black spots ; in addition to this there were a few larger black spots
at the blunt end of the egg. Both birds took part in nest building,
at least the cock pretended to do so, constantly getting in the
way with coarse pieces of hay which did not appear in the com-
position of the nest. He reminded me very forcibly of the circus
clown who tries to be so very helpful in clearing the arena
for the next turn and who, in fact, only delays the other
workers.

On this occasion the site chosen was a thick privet bush, and
the nest was much as last year's, though possibly not quite such a
fine work of art.
I never saw the male incubating, but when the chicks hatched
at the end of twelve days he made up for any past deficiencies.
I did not inspect the young until a couple of days after the
hatching ; they were by then very well grown and covered with
black down, crops bulging with canary and millet seeds. During
these early days the male became almost tame in his anxiety to
get mealworms and finally I had to contrive a little feeding cage
which he could enter, but in which the bars were too close for the
larger insect lovers which shared the aviary with the Black-crests.
At ten days the chicks were well quilted and looked much like
House Sparrows. Six days later both left the nest (3rd June).
4th June was a day of holiday and merry-making in my old
home, but this year calamity overtook my little family.
An infuriated Thrush which could not get at the Black-crests'
supply of insects savagely attacked the little hen as she was leaving
the little feeding cage, and killed her instantly in front of my eyes
before I could get into the aviary.
The cock, much too busy to notice or mourn his widowhood,
simply redoubled his efforts to such good purpose that the two
young, who could fly strongly from the first day, were feeding and
independent within a week of leaving the nest. At sixteen days
both chicks were drab counterparts of the hen with very short tails
and no crests. Both these appendages quickly began to grow
and at two months neither was distinguishable from an adult hen ;
I feel certain that they are both of this sex.
Had the old hen been murdered a week earlier, when she was
still brooding her young, these notes would never have been written.
A very easy species to breed but I am not sure that success could
be attained without the use of mealworms, or ants-eggs in season ;
gentles were completely ignored.

Mr. Webb brought six of these very attractive Plovers in
May, 1933. They were found by him in the Highland plains,
below the Aberdare mountains at an altitude of 8,000 feet.
According to Webb they were very partial to the paddocks where
cattle are herded at night. A very good photograph of this bird
appeared in the Avicultural Magazine of 1933 on page 194.
Two of the six birds were kept at the Zoo, and the other four
came here, and were turned out in one of the large aviaries, which
housed a good many other birds including some Avocets and Stilts.
They were exceedingly wild, and one actually killed himself by
constantly flying against the wire netting on top of the aviaries.
The other three gradually settled down and this year have become
almost tame. On 31st May two eggs were seen on a large stone
at the side of the pond. There was no nest made, and it was only
the hollow in the stone that prevented the eggs from rolling into
the pond. On 9th June one egg- disappeared, and this, I believe,
was eaten by a pair of Madagascar Partridges. The Partridges
were instantly removed into another aviary. On 28th June one
young was hatched, and we caught the old birds up and put them
with the young one in a small aviary about four feet square. The
birds did not like being put into this small aviary, and kept
trampling on the young one and taking no notice of it. We then
turned them out in the large aviary again where they were perfectly
happy and took great care of their chick. The old birds were seen
continually taking bits of minced meat from the sleeping quarters,
where the food is placed, to the outside flight to the chick. When
fourteen days old the young one was often seen in the sleeping
quarters, eating from the food tray. The young one was fed
principally on meat and a few mealworms, and was no bother at
all to rear. When born the young bird was identical to all other
young Plovers. The colour of the chick when a month old was
a greyish fawn on the upper parts, underparts dirty white, beak
and legs slate coloured. The eggs were fawn coloured splashed with
large black spots. I believe this is the first time this Plover has been
bred in captivity.

Of all the birds in Australia none are more charming than the
Blue Wrens ; they are indeed the fairies of the avian world. Few
birds I have ever met with on my travels possess such charm and
beauty ; they have characteristics all of their own which put them
apart from other birds. I had seen plenty of pictures of them and
also stuffed specimens in museums but it was like comparing a
mummy to a ballet dancer ; they couldn't be compared to that
tiny dancing atom of intense turquoise blue which is such a familiar
creature in Australia. In the public parks, in back gardens, or
in the vast forest lands he is always the same, a dancing wraith-like
creature of ethereal blue.
Like our own bird at home, but only half the size, and twice
as active, he is always on the move with his long thin tail kept
upright at right angles to his body.
The Colin MacKenzie Sanctuary near Healsville swarmed
with these dainty little birds and I saw more fully plumaged males
there than anywhere else. They were everywhere and very tame,
so one was able to observe them at one's leisure. They are the
embodiment of perpetual motion as they scurry through the low
vegetation or dance along the ground, the cocks sometimes finding
time to mount the top of a bush and sing their short trilling song
very much like that of a Reed Warbler.
The dull coloured females are charming in a quiet way and have
a very alert appearance with their long tails cocked up over their
backs. I saw the birds feeding their young in January. These
resemble the hen bird and it is three years, I think, before the male
gets his plumage. He has an " undress " period when he goes out
of colour and resembles the hen. Books tell us that after the cock
bird has been in colour for three successive years he retains his
blue plumage. According to friends who have kept these birds
for years this is not so, and the male always has an eclipse plumage.
Around Lagoon Station all the birds were in the eclipse plumage,
and I did not see one male in colour. One would have thought that
there would at least have been one over the period in which the
bird is supposed to retain its coloured plumage.

By a pond in a district some miles from the homestead I made
the acquaintance of the most superb of all the Blue Wrens, if not
the most beautiful of the Australian birds, the Black-backed Blue
Wren. Once when I was in Fiji I met with a tiny fish living in
the hot pools on the coral reefs and I thought it was the bluest thing
I had ever seen. From a distance it looked like a small brilliant
blue electric light, it was the most intense " living " blue I had ever
seen. But when I saw this tiny ball of brilliant blue feathers hopping
and flitting in the low grey herbage I thought it was even bluer
than my shining blue fish of the coral reefs in Fiji. Of all the
birds I had ever seen this was the loveliest. It had a large moustache-
like patch of wax-like egg-shell blue which stood out from the
side of the head ; the rest of the body varied from cornflower to
delphinium blue with a thin black crescent on the breast and a
broader one on the nape. There were a great many females and
uncoloured males about and these, too, were lovely with their
delicate grey-brown bodies and their long upstanding lavender-
blue tails.
These birds live in small colonies or family parties in the low
dense bushes, flitting one after the other in a ceaseless round of
activity from one bush to another.
I saw the male of one species which I could not recognize ;
he was like a dull edition of the common bird, but with a brilliant
blue moustache-like tuft which stood at an angle from the body,
and his back was reddish chestnut. This bird was followed by a
whole host of youngsters who seemed to harass the father in the
most embarrassing manner, all crowding around him in his search
for insects, and as soon as he got one, there was a " general post
There are fourteen distinct species of these lovely Wrens in
which blues of varying shades predominate in the plumage ;
some are marked with red, others white, and one with orchid-
purple. When once established they are easy to keep in captivity
and have in years gone by been bred in a London back garden !
Around the dam near the homestead at Lagoon Station, which
by the way was a perfect Eldorado for birds, one saw odd pairs
of that beautiful little wader, the Black-fronted Dotterel, running
along the water's edge with great rapidity. One is almost sure
to see a pair of these birds around any small dam or pool in the
interior ; usually one pair is in possession of such a small sheet

of water. These birds are often found at great distances
inland.
The tiny Grebe, known as the Hoary-headed and locally as the
Dabchick, is quite unlike our well-known bird. It has a longer
neck and swims along with its hind parts held high ; in fact,
from a distance, it resembles in shape a miniature cygnet. I found
it common on the smaller ponds and dams in South Australia
where it was very tame. As soon as one approached, the birds
dived, but if one settled down to watch them they soon became
used to one's presence and resumed their usual activities. They
are quite the prettiest of the smaller Grebes.
There was also another small species of Grebe to be seen on
the ponds, the Black-throated. This is about the same size as the
Hoary-headed, but not so rotund in build, and of a very dark
colour with a white mark on the chin and sides of the face. This
bird was also common and frequented the same ponds as its
congener. I saw one pair with young which were heavily striped
longitudinally.
Our old friends the Zebra Finches were everywhere ; around
the wells and dams there must have been thousands of them and
even if not seen, one soon knew of their presence by the tinny
trumpet-like song of the cock birds hidden in the low bushes.
A great many of the birds I saw were youngsters, so it must have
been just after the breeding season. Around the homestead they
nest in all manner of places like our sparrows at home.
Around the house and farm buildings a pair of Pied Grallinas
or Magpie Larks lived, and had their nest in a nearby tree. These
birds have no connection with either Magpies or Larks and they
are one of the most striking and conspicuous birds in Australia,
at home either in the far interior or in a suburban back garden.
Their nest is most extraordinary and resembles a thin and shallow
bowl made of mud, strengthened with hair, and placed on a
horizontal limb of a tree. So perfectly spherical is it that it looks
as if it had been turned on a potter's wheel.
These birds are found around farms and their presence is
looked on with favour by the farmers, as they are supposed to
eat the snails which carry the liver fluke, a deadly parasite of sheep.
The Grallinas have very loud, powerful, and musical voices and
a very peculiar flopping flight. They are seldom found far away

from water where they can find the mud with which to construct
their unique nests. The Pied Grallina is the size of a Jackdaw
but slimmer and strikingly marked with black and white.
Another very noticeable bird, but rather an uncommon one,
is the Chestnut-crowned Babbler which I saw when we were
driving sheep near Mr. Gebhardt's place. The Australian Babblers
are very conspicuous birds which the proverbial blind man in a
dark room could hardly miss. If one is to judge by the number
of names in the vernacular, these birds must have made an
impression on the Australians, " Happy Jack," " Happy Family,"
" Twelve Apostles," " Hopper," "Jumper," are but a few of the
names these birds are known by and which give an indication of
its character.
Exceedingly noisy and active, the birds spend most of their
time bustling about the low herbage and on the ground in small
flocks or family parties, being extremely loquacious all the while
as if to call attention to their activities, as much as to say, " Hello,
there, look how busy we are, keep out of our way, we haven't
a moment to spare ! " Not only is this bird of very striking
demeanour but its plumage is equally obtrusive. Larger in size
than a thrush, it has a big fan-shaped tail tipped with white which
it is always displaying. In colour it is a rich brown conspicuously
marked with white, the head being bright chestnut edged with
white. This is the brightest of the four so-called Babblers of the
genus Pomatorhinus which is confined to Australia.
Wood-Swallows were common in the Lagoon Station district
and I saw several species both there and in the districts around
Adelaide. Although possessing no brilliant colours they are
extremely beautiful birds and their habits make them very con-
spicuous. Like Flycatchers, they take up their stand on the top-
most branch of a tree or other point of vantage and make excursions
after winged insects. They rather resemble large thick-set Swallows
and their flight is very swallow-like though they are not related
to these birds. They have a habit, when alighting, of jerking their
large slightly forked tails up and down. The food of the Wood-
Swallows consists entirely of insects taken on the wing. About
Lagoon Station I noticed the White-browed, the most beautiful
of these birds, whose plumage is a combination of soft greys, black,
and white with a rich chestnut breast.

I also noted the Masked Wood-Swallow, a rather duller bird,
and about Adelaide I saw the Dusky Wood-Swallow. Of these
latter I saw a family party, the parents and young ; the youngsters
obviously not long out of the nest. Once the Wood-Swallows
were well-known birds to aviculturists in England but they never
seem to come over now, very probably they get sent to foreign
countries !
The Welcome Swallow was also noticed, a common bird in
Australia and very much like the European one.
There were a good many species of Honey-Eaters in the district
and one of the most conspicuous was the Spiney-cheeked, so called
because of the white spine-like quills on the cheeks. The bright
pink beak is a most conspicuous feature of the bird. It is a fine
songster as indeed are many of the Honey-Eaters. One day when
I was out in the bush I came upon a pair of these birds, and as
there were a good number of other birds in the vicinity I sat down
to watch them. The cock bird was a bit shy at first, but he was
rather curious and generally eyed me over. Gradually he came
closer and started to sing ; he came nearer and nearer, most
obviously singing for my benefit, until he was but a few feet away
and was by this time singing his best. This is the first time that
a wild bird has sung for my benefit which he evidently did. The
bird's whole demeanour was that he wanted me to appreciate his
fine vocal efforts, which I certainly did. The song is almost exactly
like that of the New Zealand Tui and in fact I have heard both
birds singing together and have been unable to tell the difference.
The Spiney-cheeked Honey-Eater was recently bred by Mr. Harvey
and this is to my mind a great achievement. This Honey-Eater
is not uncommon in the scrub regions of the interior, but gets
rarer towards the coast.
We used to watch in the evenings the Bronze-wing Pigeons
coming in to drink at the pools ; unfortunately these birds are
very extensively shot and consequently are very shy. The Common
Bronze-wing has a swift and noiseless flight in strange contrast to
the loud clattering flight of the Crested Bronze-wing. They come
in ones and twos, alight some distance from the water, watch for
a time to see if all is well, then make little sudden advances, stopping
every few yards, then take a hurried drink when they reach the
water and are quickly off again.

Another very noticeable bird seen was the White-browed Tree-
Creeper, a bird more than twice the size of the European Tree-
Creeper. It is strikingly coloured and finds all its food on the
trunks of the trees, where it is always seen actively engaged in
searching the crevices in the bark for insects. I saw many of these
birds and was surprised at their tameness.
On the scrub lands we saw odd specimens of the Grey Shrike
Thrush, a rather sombre coloured bird with a very fine song.
Numerous Chats were seen ; we had hoped to see the wonderful
Crimson Chat, one of the most brilliant of Australian birds ;
it was found in the vicinity frequenting the flat bush-covered areas
where it makes itself conspicuous by perching on the tops of the
bushes. This species is largely nomadic and unluckily I missed
seeing them while at Lagoon Station. The Chats which we did see
were the White-fronted, a bird I had already seen on Swan Island
off the Victorian coast. Other birds seen in the district were
Sparrow-hawks, which were very common ; Stubble Quail, too,
were seen, but these are difficult birds to study. One meets with
them when out riding and they fly up with an explosive flight just
from under the horses hoofs and hurtle themselves into the
vegetation some distance away.
Unfortunately I didn't stay very long at this interesting place.
I had to go back to Adelaide to catch a steamer to Sydney as I had
some livestock with which it would have been impossible to travel
such a long distance on the railway.

Homing Budgerigars
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995816" page_id="56322995"  page_num="341" year="" vol="">
In the wild state Budgerigars are great roamers, flying in large flocks from one
district to another as the grass-seed ripens. So they are by nature unsuited to
naturalization in any one particular district. However, in a letter in Cage Birds and
Bird Fancy , Lord Tavistock claims to be able to produce a " homing " strain.
He says that " after many generations have been reared in confinement, our present
day aviary strains yield a higher and varying percentage of stayers among old
breedings. . . . The normal young Budgerigar, when free to do so, leaves his birth-
place as soon as he is completely independent of his parents, or within the first
few weeks of his independence, and only about ten per cent remain after a month,
when their ceres begin to take on the adult colour and the danger period is past.
Youngsters which have passed this test are the foundation stock for a strain of
real ' homers ', for I find that their offspring yield about 50 per cent of stayers and
there is little doubt that every succeeding generation will give improved results."
The other 50 per cent would partly account for the many escaped Budgerigars
that one hears of, which are generally discovered being eaten by the cat or in a
dying condition through lack of their accustomed supply of seed.

Early this year Mr. H. G. Otto Fockelmann kindly gave me two yellow
Seed-crackers or Cuckoo Weavers (. Anomalospiza imherbis ) from East Africa. In
earlier days this bird was included with the Serins as Serinus or Crithagra imberbis,
both by Reichenow (Die Vogel Deutsch Ost-Afrikas and in the B.M.C. Birds, vol. xii,
p. 355 -) A characteristic coloured figure of it may be found among the Serins
on pi. xii facing p. 288 in Fremdlandische Stubenvogel (Karl Neunzig) under the
term " Dickschnabelgirlitz " but the correct scientific name is used.
The genus is listed page 784 in Systema Avium JEthiopicarum (W. L. Sclater),
pt. 2, 1930. I am afraid both are males. It is a silent statuesque bird sitting very
upright when perched either on twigs or large leaves and an easy bird to photo-
graph. In demeanour and form it has nothing in common with any Serin and
in no way behaves in the fussy manner common to typical weaver birds of the
Euplectes or Ploceus groups.
From the same source I obtained two (unfortunately both males) Sparrows
(1 Sorella eminibey ). This Chestnut Sparrow which is mainly clad in rich deep chestnut
is a cheerful active species hailing from the Upper White Nile to Uganda and
Kenya, etc. Full description of the species may be found on p. 332 B.M.C. Birds,
vol. xii, and the genus is listed p. 726, pt. ii, in Sclaters systematic list of birds of
Africa, 1930. I have remote hopes of obtaining females for both species.

The Masked Grassfinch inhabits North-Western Australia and
has, from time to time, been freely imported and proved a com-
paratively hardy and very desirable aviary bird. It breeds freely,
making the usual domed nest, either in a bush, nesting-basket, or
box. It is less quarrelsome than either the Long-tailed Grassfinch
(P. acuticauda) or the Parson Finch (P. cincta ), though it will readily
produce hybrids with either.
This species belongs to a group of closely related Grassfinches
consisting of the Parson Finch of the eastern parts of Australia,
the Long-tailed of the north and west, the White-eared (P. leucotis )
from Northern Queensland and the Masked.
Years ago the only one we ever saw was the Parson Finch, but
the importation of this has practically ceased for several years past.
Then came the Long-tail in its two forms, the Yellow-billed
(P. acuticauda ) and its red-billed race (P. hecki). The very beautiful
White-eared (P. leucotis ) has been imported on very few occasions.
It was the subject of a very fine coloured plate in our Magazine
for 1898, illustrating an article by the late Reginald Phillipps.
I have not seen a specimen since those early days. P. personata,
though a very charming bird, is not so beautiful as its White-eared
cousin of the north-eastern parts of Australia.

Go-operation between Societies and the Trade
On the suggestion of the Editor of the Avicultural Magazine.,
a meeting was held on 21st September at Dorset House, London,
by kind invitation of the Editor of Cage Birds , Mr. E. R. W. Lincoln,,
in order to discuss the whole question of aviculture in time of war.
The meeting was largely attended by representatives of the
Societies concerned, and by leading members of the trade in
bird foods, etc. Unfortunately, Mr. Alfred Ezra, President of
the Avicultural Society, and the Secretary, Miss Knobel, were
unable to be present ; and the Editor, Miss Barclay-Smith was
prevented at the last minute from attending by being called for
war work. The Society, however, was well represented by
Mr. David Seth-Smith. Mr. E. R. W. Lincoln presided over the
meeting, and the main points discussed were (i) the state of
existing food supplies ; (2) facilities of economic distribution of
foodstuffs ; (3) evacuation of valuable stocks to safe areas ;
(4) special activities to be undertaken by leading societies in time
of war ; (5) breeding mealworms and other live foods. A lengthy
discussion on the first two items took place. Representatives of
the trade stated that there were adequate supplies in the country
for the next few months and that there were a number of seed-
producing countries which would be able to maintain the supply
providing transport was available. It was considered by the
meeting that the distribution of stocks to retailers was a matter
which should be dealt with by co-operation between leading
firms in order to save petrol and to ensure that each district had
adequate supplies ; and representatives of the trade stated that
they were already taking steps to prevent hoarding. In summing
up it was agreed that there was at present no shortage of raw
material, that there was a general desire not to interfere with the
small trader, and that it might be necessary, in order to avoid
overlapping, to pool transport. This question would be further
discussed at subsequent meetings. In reply to Mr. Seth-Smith's
proposal that some scheme for breeding mealworms on a large
scale should immediately be put forward, Mr. Harris (representing
Messrs. De Von and Go.) stated that the majority of imports of

mealworms was from Holland. The meeting then discussed the
possibilities of breeding mealworms in Great Britain, but it was
felt that it should not attempt to take steps which might harm
the trade of dealers here and breeders in a neutral country.
The representatives of the Avicultural Society, the Foreign
Bird League, the British Bird Breeders Association, and the
Budgerigar Society reported on the steps being taken by them to
secure volunteers to take charge of birds of those called for active or
national service, and also for the evacuation of birds from areas
vulnerable to air attack ; these societies will all co-operate in
this scheme.
The meeting concluded with a vote of thanks to the Editor and
proprietors of Cage Birds for organizing the meeting and providing
the room, and also for their offer of facilities for future meetings
of a similar nature to deal with any emergencies that may arise.
Care of Birds in War Time
In response to the appeal in the October number of the Avicul-
tural Magazine several offers of accommodation have been re-
ceived and a register containing all details is being kept. Members
desiring to take advantage of these offers are requested to com-
municate with Mr. David Seth-Smith, Curator's House, Zoological
Gardens, London, N.W. 8, who will supply all particulars.
Warm thanks are expressed to the members of the Society who
have thus come forward in order to help their fellow aviculturists.
The Maintenance of Collections
The spirit shown by Monsieur Jean Delacour, who, as he states
in his article published in this number, is for the second time in
a quarter of a century making every effort to maintain his collec-
tion (despite the fact that he is serving in the French army and
having to contend with the greatest difficulties), is one that should
animate every true aviculturist. The inclination to disperse
collections instantly and without foresight is certainly one that
should be curbed as far as possible, even though the difficulties
may at the moment appear unsurmountable. In his letter in this
number concerning the maintenance of stocks of rare waterfowl,

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99539992" page_id="56323006"  page_num="346" year="" vol="">
Mr. Moody puts forward an excellent suggestion which should
certainly be acted upon. It is of the utmost importance that the
trouble and work of years should not be lost for the lack of a little
organization, and it is hoped that all breeders of waterfowl will
act in concert together. The Editor will be glad to receive letters
from those who are willing to take part in this scheme.
Supplies of Live Food
Dr. Amsler, in a letter, suggests that the question of the breeding
of mealworms and other live food on a large scale should be
considered. Though the meeting held on 21st September was of
the opinion that this matter need not be further considered, it
would be as well that full investigations as to the possibilities of
producing a supply of live food should be made, in case the supplies
from Holland should be, for any reason, unavailable.
In conclusion, the Editor accords warm thanks to those who,
despite the calls made on their time in the present emergency,
have so promptly responded to the request for contributions to
the Magazine. Without their help the Magazine, and subsequently
the Society, would surely die, but with it we can keep both alive
in spite of the adverse odds we are at present facing.
It is particularly hoped that aviculturists overseas, who perhaps
may have more opportunity and time for aviculture than those
who are immediately concerned with the war, will do their utmost
to help the Society and the Magazine through the hard days that
are before us.

<bodyText confidence="0.9797784" page_id="56323007"  page_num="347" year="" vol="">
By J. Delacour
The maintenance in war-time of a large collection of birds
is a serious problem. Shortage of labour and food, and many
handicaps of various sorts, necessitate careful supervision and
planning, if one wants to take every chance to ensure their surviving.
As our older members may remember, it is the second time
in a quarter of a century that I am facing such difficulties. In
September, 1914, the Germans reached Villers-Bretonneux, in
Picardy, killing and letting out a certain number of my birds, but
the bulk of the collection was saved and, after the retreat of the
enemy, kept in excellent condition for nearly four years. In
March, 1918 , unfortunately, their last offensive brought the
Germans back to our grounds, when they were stopped first by
British and French troops, and later on the Australians. Severe
fighting took place for several months in the park,&amp;apos; the result
being complete destruction of the birds and everything else
there was.
In the present tragic circumstances, Cleres can be expected to
be reasonably safe, and as far as one can foresee, the question of
labour and food, difficult as they are, ought not to be an impossi-
bility. Therefore we hope to preserve the collection, or at least
the best part of it, and we are making arrangements accordingly.
All our gardeners and four bird-keepers have joined up since
the beginning of the war ; another one is soon going. But
Mr. Fooks is fortunately staying at Cleres, and is able to carry
on with a reduced staff. By the doubtful privilege of age, I am
remaining in the district, though on military duty, so that I can see
my birds at frequent intervals.
For the moment we have decided to keep the whole of the
collection, only thinning out gradually to a couple of pairs the
more ordinary species of Pheasants, waterfowl, and small birds,
or even suppressing the very common ones altogether.
I hope that other members will report in the Magazine on their
position and plans as far as maintaining their collections is
concerned.

J. DELAGOUR-THE BIRDS AT CLERES IN 1939
Breeding in 1939
Breeding results in 1939 were rather interesting on the whole,
several species being reared at Cleres for the first time.
During the thirty years that I have been keeping Ostriches, we
have never had anything but unfertile eggs, although females usually
lay large clutches. This is generally the case in northern countries,
but in North Africa, on the Riviera, and also in California, they
often breed freely. This year, we have eight excellent young
Ostriches, hatched in an incubator in August.
The parents were received three years ago from Senegal as
very young birds, four months old about, and raised at home.
Perhaps this has something to do with their stamina and fertility.
Last year they produced some unfertile eggs, but last June they
started laying good ones. As before, the cock, very spiteful and
dangerous, scratched a large hole in the ground where the hen
deposited her eggs, and several were broken. About twelve were
removed and placed in an incubator. For the first lot, the incuba-
tion period was 53 days, the incubator being kept at a temperature
of 36-37* centigrade, and cooled thirty minutes a day ; two chicks
were hatched, one dying in the shell, and another fertile egg being
broken. The second lot was kept at the higher temperature of
38'5* centigrade, and cooled only 15 minutes a day, the six fertile
eggs being hatched on the forty-second day.
Ostrich chicks are extremely quaint and amusing, round in
shape, and looking rather like hedgehogs in their rough down ;
they have curious short jelly-like legs and swollen nape the first
day. They proved very tame and sensible. Placed into a hut
heated by a stove, as we always do for young Rheas, with covered-
over run well supplied with sand and a grassy enclosure outside, they
were first fed on biscuit meal mash, cut up green food, with plenty
of grit. The first three days, they ate nothing but sand, and started
on mash and green food the fourth day. They did splendidly from
the beginning, and are now already quite big and strong.
Nine white and six grey Rheas were also reared. It is interesting
to note that during the unusually cold winter of 1938-39, when
the thermometer dropped at Cleres to 5 0 F., all Ostriches,
Cassowaries, Emus, and Rheas kept in perfect health, the last
two species outside ; Ostriches and Cassowaries in unheated wooden

shelters or barns, proving the complete hardiness of these large
birds.
Cranes laid very well, but we were unlucky in several ways.
Three Demoiselle and two Stanley chicks, several weeks old, died
of gapes, so quickly that they could not be noticed in time and
saved. The White Asiatics laid one unfertile egg, the first one since
eighteen years that they have been at Cleres. The Eastern Sarus
paired up to an Australian, which had reared many young in the
past, laid late, and did not hatch. One Manchurian was reared.
A pair made up of a cock Grey-necked and a female Black-necked
Crown Crane, long in the park, built for the first time a large nest

unusual number of three eggs late in August, and hatched them
all by the end of September. They are doing well in a small pen,
where they can be shut in at night. The male seems to be taking
the greatest care of them. I hope that they will be reared, as it
would be interesting to see what these hybrids will look like.
The breeding pairs never showed any sign of bad temper towards
other Cranes, Crown, Demoiselles, Sandbills, or Common, or
waterfowl in the park during incubation, which both birds
shared in turn.
Five Black Swans were reared, but three Black-necked chicks

Many Ducks were reared from eggs collected round the lake

Red Shovellers, Versicolor, and Cinnamon Teal, Greater Scaup,
and a few commoner species.

In the greenhouses, an Elliot Pitta and seven Indo-Chinese
Shamas (two broods) were successfully bred. White-capped
Redstarts nested several times without result, proving extremely
spiteful during the season. A pair of Garnet-throated Humming
Birds built a lovely nest in an hibiscus tree, but did not go any
further.
Now, all the birds have been removed from greenhouses to
bird-rooms, as it would have been very difficult to obtain coal to
heat them during the winter. The rarer plants have been deposited
at the Rouen Botanical Gardens, and I hope to be able to replant
the houses when the war is over. It was very heart-breaking to me
to close these houses, which were so attractive in every way ; this is
the only noticeable difference that the war has made to Cleres so far.
In a later article, I hope to say something of our rarer species
which have not bred during the year.

An all too short a time was spent in South Australia and I had
several very interesting little tours with Mr. Harvey into the
country districts and saw many birds which were new to me in a
wild state. The chief amongst these was the Fire-tailed Finch, or,
as it is known in Australia, the Beautiful Fire tail. It is rather an
uncommon and shy denizen of the scrub and heath-lands, and is
easily located in the area where it lives by its distinctive call.
It does not seem to be found in flocks like the usual run of Finches,
but in pairs and small family parties. The country in which this
bird lives was quite different to any other I struck when I was out
there. The chief food of this bird is the seed of the 44 Bull Oak ".
I could never find the scientific name of this tree, but the seeds are
contained in small roundish cones which are extremely hard
and take a long time to open. The method adopted by the trappers
is to burn a small area containing these trees which makes the cones
open and shed their seeds. The birds are attracted by this and once
located are easily caught. I saw very few of these birds in a wild
state ; for one thing, they are rather shy and my time was limited ;
no doubt had I been able to stay for some time in the district
where they were found I could have seen more of them.
A good many people in Australia have at one time or another
attempted to keep the birds but few are successful in keeping them
for any length of time. When once apparently established they
do well, but suddenly die off for no apparent reason. Some avicul-
turists have bred them, but no one seems very successful with them
in the long run, though Dr. Cinner of Adelaide had been very
successful with the Red-eared Firetail, a much rarer, and to my
mind, a very much more beautiful bird than the so-called
" Beautiful ". This bird is restricted to a very small area in the
extreme West of Australia. I consider it one of the most beautiful
of Finches, but more of this anon.
One evening, sitting near a small pool which we called the Pool
of the Honey-Eaters, we saw a good many birds, especially
Honey-Eaters, which seemed to come in relays to bathe. The

commonest bird and to me the most beautiful of the Australian
Honey-Eaters was the New Holland. During the whole time we
were by the pool these birds came in to bathe and very lovely they
looked with their strikingly marked black, white, and yellow
plumage. There were a great many in the vicinity feeding on the
strange cone-like flowers of the Banksias. Other Honey-Eaters
seen were the Crescent, a smallish bird rather like a dull edition of
the foregoing. The birds inhabit the scrubby heath-lands and get
most of their sustenance from the eucalyptus flowers. The Lunated
Honey-Eater is also a common bird, small, greenish in colour,
with a white crescent-shaped mark on the nape, hence the name.
The Singing Honey-Eater was also seen, though " Singing " is
rather a misnomer as the bird has little song. A better name in the
vernacular would be a translation of its Latin name, Virencens,
or greenish.
The only Peaceful Dove I saw whilst in Australia was by the
Honey-Eater's pool ; it was very tame and fed only a few yards
away from us on minute seeds which it procured from the dusty
soil. These tiny Doves, in common with their near relations, the
Diamond Doves, are common birds and often kept in captivity.
Mr. Ward of Sydney had both white and fawn specimens which
he bred true to colour in his aviaries.
We saw large numbers of Diamond Sparrows, which seemed to
feed by the roadsides and upon approach would fly on to the tele-
graph wires. These birds were very timid and it was difficult
to get close to them. At the pool we saw a Sacred Kingfisher,
flying down and taking insects off the water, a most unusual thing
for these birds which are not birds of the water as our European
bird is. The Australian Sacred Kingfisher seems a much smaller
and brighter bird than the New Zealand one, though they are
supposed to be one and the same species.
The Crested Pigeon, or Crested Bronzewing as it is called in
Australia, is a common bird in South Australia where I saw numbers,
usually around water holes and dams where they came to drink.
It is a very wary bird but should one sit around the water in the
evenings the birds will approach quite close. The flight is extremely
loud and noisy.
The Australian Crow is a large bird approximating the Raven
of Europe. In the district around Lagoon Station it was very much

in evidence. It has an extremely loud and unpleasant call some-
what between the bleating of a sheep and the nocturnal calls of a
cat. It is a very noisy bird and takes delight in making as much
noise as possible. It is bold and fearless, often landing within a few
feet to give one a thorough inspection. It is one of the few birds
I ever felt a dislike for. It strikes one that it knows everything
that is going on and is always gossiping with its friends about it.
Whatever one is doing the bird is watching. It is reputed to kill
and eat small birds and take eggs, but it seemed, as far as I could
see, to be little feared by the other birds. It feeds mainly on insects
and any scraps which it can pick up around the farm buildings.
In South Australia I saw three species of the Psephotus Parra-
keets, Blue Bonnets, Manycolours, and Redrumps. These latter
were very common around Adelaide, and I was told that they
sometimes came into the gardens in the city. They are found in
small flocks in the open country and one often disturbs them feeding
on the roadway. They look singularly brilliant on the wing as
their crimson rump patch shows up to advantage. As they fly
they utter a soft musical call very different from the usual harsh
notes of the majority of Parrakeets. Their food consists of the seeds
of various grasses which they find on the ground ; in fact, in
Australia they are known as Grass Parrakeets, a name which really
belongs to the Neophemas.
I found these birds very plentiful some distance from Newcastle,
in New South Wales, where small parties could be seen feeding
on the ripening seeds of a tall grass-like plant which is used for
cattle fodder and which looked to me uncommonly like dari. I saw
few, if any, of these birds in the aviaries of aviculturists in Australia,
I suppose the reason being that they are too common. I saw a
good number in the dealers' shops but I suppose these were for
export.
Whilst in Melbourne I was asked to join a small party of
bird-watchers who were spending some days on a low sandy island
some seventy miles from Melbourne. Of course I gladly accepted
and had a delightful time seeing many interesting species for the
first time. What a rush I had catching the ship which was to take
us to the nearest port ! It was Foundation Day, a kind of Bank
Holiday, when everyone starts on their summer holidays. The
little steamer was crowded, there being over 2,000 on board, but it

was a good-natured crowd and everyone seemed happy. At
a small resort some sixty miles away from Melbourne we dis-
embarked and transferred to a specially chartered fishing smack.
After quite a lengthy sail we landed. The island, long, low, and
flat, and beloved of wading birds, reminded me of a favourite spot
at home where I have spent pleasant hours, Scolt Head Island
off the Norfolk coast. The sight of it and the thought of days of
brilliant sunshine and bird-watching gave me a great thrill.
The largest and most outstanding bird we saw there was the
Australian Pelican. These birds visited the island in the early
morning and it was a magnificent spectacle to see these huge birds
sailing majestically along in the clear early morning atmosphere
looking like some pre-historic pterodactyl. It is an amazing thing
how agile and light these huge birds are in flight. They are anything
but laboured or heavy and they can soar to great heights with the
utmost ease. Few birds present such a spectacular sight as a flock
of Pelicans in flight.
Another bird which I was glad to see was the beautiful Australian
Sheld-duck, a bird almost unknown to aviculturists outside Australia
until very recently. A large flock of these birds came from the
mainland and settled to feed on a certain marine grass which grows
in the shallow water and which is also greatly relished by the Black
Swans. We crept up to the birds hoping to watch them, but we
underestimated their timidity and watchfulness, for when we were
still a good distance from them they took flight and returned
to the mainland from whence they had come, and we never saw
them again. Evidently they were unused to have visitors on the
island and thought it better to stay away until we departed. I
regretted that the birds did not return as I always wanted to study
this bird in a state of Nature. One of the most beautiful of the Sheld-
ducks, the Radjah or White-headed, is found in Australia, but it
comes from the tropical regions and though I saw no wild birds I saw
several in captivity. All around the island were spectacular flocks
of Black Swans, hundreds and hundreds of them. This was one of
their favourite resorts and they came here to feed on the kind of
marine grass previously mentioned which grows very profusely
in the shallow waters. It was a strange sight to see the flocks feeding
with their heads and necks under the water ; they looked like a
fleet of miniature galleons floating along. They were not as wary

<bodyText confidence="0.999092487179487" page_id="56323015"  page_num="355" year="" vol="">
as the Sheld-duck, but if one approached too close there was a
mighty threshing of the water and then a loud report like machine
gun fire as the whole flock took wing. They made a magnificent
sight with their black bodies and snow-white wings as they got up
and gradually formed into the usual Swan formation. At night it
was a sight to thrill any bird lover's heart to see string after string
of these large birds pass across the paling evening sky. The Swans
feed during most of the night as well as in the day, and their voices
added greatly to the babble of bird sounds during the night. When
encouraged the Swans will frequent quite small ponds and lakes
and become very tame.
The vast shallow lagoon in the centre of the island was
a sanctuary for thousands of waders, nearly all visitors from the
Far North. Most were in the " off-season 55 plumage and many
were hard to recognize. Perhaps the commonest was the Red-
necked Stint, easily distinguished by its very small size even though
it was lacking the nuptial plumage. This little bird was in countless
numbers and quite the tamest of the waders except the Sharp-
tailed Sandpiper, allowing one to approach within a few yards.
This bird is a winter migrant from North-Eastern Siberia. It spends
its time by the edge of the tide feeding on small crustaceans, etc.
It leaves Australia for its Northern breeding range in February.
The Sharp-tailed Sandpiper was another very common bird
which comes from the far North Pacific lands and spends its winter
or rather southern summer in the Antipodes. As well as frequenting
the mud flats it is to be found in pairs in the boggy and marshy
places where few other waders are found. Like the Stint, it is a
confiding bird and seems reluctant to take flight until one is nearly
on top of it. The white rump and pointed tail serve to distinguish
this bird.
The Oyster-catcher is another well-known wader found in
small numbers on the island. These birds keep in small parties
around the main shores and are wary and suspicious. In
with one party we came across the very much rarer Sooty or Black
Oyster-catcher, a bird confined to the Australian regions though
sometimes occurring in New Zealand.
We were able to pick out and identify a bird very rarely recorded
in Australia, namely the Wood Sandpiper, which had previously
been unrecorded for Victoria. This bird is distinguished by its

large pointed wings, and larger size than most Sandpipers. It is
a rare straggler from Northern Europe and Asia. The bird we
had under observation kept more or less to itself and did not appear
to consort with the other waders.
The Curlew Sandpiper was another common bird. It is a large
Sandpiper with a slightly down-curved bill. These birds consorted
with the other waders, especially the Stints, in the shallow lagoon
in the centre of the island. Its home is in the far North of Siberia
where it breeds, migrating to the South after the nesting season.
Also fairly common was the Grey-tailed Tatler from Eastern
Siberia, a near relation to the well-known Wandering Tatler of
the U.S.A. This is a large Sandpiper-like bird found consorting
with the other waders on the mud flats.
There were large flocks of those well-known and cosmopolitan
birds, the Golden and Grey Plovers ; birds not always easy to
distinguish in their " undress 55 plumage, the best method of
identification being their flight.
Perhaps the commonest bird of all and one which could be
seen in huge flocks was the Bar-tailed God wit. Another very
cosmopolitan little bird found around the shores of the islands
was the Turnstone, one of the prettiest of the waders and a most
delightful aviary bird. The birds seen were rather drab compared
to the brightly coloured specimens one sees in England when they
are in their breeding plumage.
A large wader seen in the company of the others was the
Greenshank ; tall and slender and easily recognized by its pale
grey colouring and green legs. The largest of all the wading birds
was the Eastern Curlew, the most easily recognized of all the
waders, apart from its large size, by its loud call with which I am
very familiar with on the moors of Derbyshire where its Western
representative breeds. These birds were extremely timid and they
are the first to retreat amongst the waders as one approaches.
The breeding range of this bird is Eastern Siberia, and it is a migrant
to Australia during the southern summer.
The Common Sandpiper is also seen on the mud flats but it
is less common than the others. Other waders were seen but it is
difficult to identify all, especially the timid ones, if they have no
outstanding characteristics.
The Caspian Tern was frequently seen and could easily be

identified by the ear long before one could by the eye, for it has
an extremely loud and raucous voice, more like that of a Cockatoo
than a Tern. This is the largest of the Terns and can be distinguished
from the others by its large size and bright red beak. There were
a number of young ones about, for the birds nest on the island.
The young do not have the red beak but they possess the loud
raucous voice of the adult.
Another Tern was the beautiful Fairy Tern, a near relation
of the well-known Little Tern. The larger Crested Tern was seen,
this is a well-known bird around the coasts of Australia. It is
somewhat smaller than the Caspian Tern and has the beak a
yellow colour and the feet and legs red, while the Caspian has black
legs and feet. On the back of the head the black feathers are
lengthened and form a crest but this is only occasionally displayed.
The island was a favourite haunt of the White-faced Heron
and great numbers were seen wading about in the shallow waters.
At one time I had over twenty under observation in a large straggling
line, wading near the shore ; they must have been in an area where
food was very abundant for with them were Black Swans, two species
of Cormorants, Curlews, Godwits, Golden Plover, Stints, and Sand-
pipers. This Heron is a common bird around the Australia coasts
and is not unduly wary, at least not on the island.
In the scrub near where we pitched our camp we found the
Little Grass Bird, a small Warbler-like bird rather shy and difficult
to observe owing to the rapidity with which it moved and its habit
of frequenting the thick vegetation.
Two birds of prey were observed soaring over the thick scrub
on the island, no doubt on the look out for the young of the White-
faced Storm Petrel. One was the Swamp Harrier, a bird which
could easily be confused with the other but for the fact that the
Harrier has a very distinctive light band across the rump which
is very conspicuous when the bird is in flight. The other bird was
the Whistling Eagle, a small Eagle not much larger than the
Harrier, which makes its presence known by its loud shrill whistling
cry which can be heard from a great distance. This Eagle is found
around the coastal regions of Australia and feeds upon carrion
in the shape of dead fish, etc., as well as upon living food.
In the low wind-swept trees around our camp we heard at
times the well-known and cheery call-notes of the Grey-backed

Zosterops, the commonest of the Zosterops in Australia and a
bird I was very familiar with in New Zealand. I hardly know how
the birds managed to exist on this rather bleak and wind-swept
island, but this little bird seems to be able to adapt itself almost
anywhere.
The beautiful White-fronted Chat was seen on the island, usually
looking very conspicuous with its black and white plumage, sitting
on the tops of the low stunted bushes, though when not disturbed
most of his time is spent on the ground searching for the insects
upon which this species mainly subsists. This bird is no relation to
the Chats of the Old World, but is a small dainty Warbler-like
bird.
Two Gulls were very common on the island, the Pacific Gull,
a large black-backed type found about the coasts of South Australia,
and the Red-billed or Silver Gull, a native of both Australia and
New Zealand, where it is extremely numerous, being as common
and familiar as the well-known Black-headed Gull in Europe.
There were many pairs of those beautiful little waders, the
Red-capped Dotterels, on the dry sandhills on the island. I am sure
that they must have had either eggs or young ones, for the several
pairs which I had under observation always tried to lead me off
the scent with the broken wing trick. Sometimes a pair would lead
me on ; running with their incredibly quick mincing steps, they
would mount one of the low sand dunes, utter their harsh cries,
then lead me on to another hillock and repeat the performance.
In the dry driven sand it was possible to see all their footprints,
and by this means I had hopes of tracking them to their nest,
but search as I might I never found one.
The island was one of the chief nesting grounds of the White-
faced Storm Petrel. In some parts the earth was riddled with
their burrows ; in fact, it was impossible to walk on the ground
without its caving in and we had to rescue many young ones from
being buried alive. There were young in all stages of development
from tiny fluffy atoms of long grey down, only a few days old, to
fully fledged youngsters nearly ready to fly. Some areas had been
abandoned owing to the top soil subsiding ; this was mainly
owing to the vegetation dying through excessive burrowing, the
roots not being able to hold the soil. Sometimes the nests were not
in the ground at all, but under dense tussocks of grass into which

the birds had burrowed. We went round at night to see the parent
birds come in from the sea. They arrive about 9 p.m., stay until
about 2 a.m., then depart again for the sea. It's wonderful how the
birds on a pitch black night can find their own burrows amongst
so many others. With the aid of an electric torch we watched them
come in. They gave no indication of their coming as their flight
is as noiseless as a snowflake, and if we kept the torch on continu-
ously they would not come, so we had to keep flashing it at intervals
on certain areas of the breeding grounds. The birds flutter in
from the sea and with no hesitation shoot right into the holes. The
White-faced Storm Petrel is a beautiful little bird, and one wonders
how such a fragile feathered creature manages to survive the terrific
storms which one encounters in those far southerly latitudes where
the bird makes its home. Yet they seem as much at home on the
most turbulent sea with the wind blowing the fiercest gale as a
Humming-bird is around a flowering shrub. To see this tiny bird
flying just under the crest of a mighty wave with dangling feet just
skimming the water itself, in the teeth of a storm of hurricane
intensity, is a feat that must be witnessed to be appreciated. Nothing
gives me greater pleasure than those days spent in cargo ships in
the far southerly latitudes watching the amazing flights of Petrels.
I have watched them for weeks on end quartering the surface of
the ocean but I have never yet seen them pick up anything in the
shape of food. However, they must do this, for they live on minute
forms of ocean life which they pick up as they skim the surface of
the water. The best place for observing Petrels and Albatrosses
is in the far south of the Indian Ocean, in those great watery wastes
between South Africa, New Zealand, and the Antarctic. I can
never imagine how these little, seemingly fragile birds, with legs
too weak even to walk upon, can excavate such lengthy and copious
burrows. Other birds seen on the island were the Little Pied and
the larger White-breasted Gormorants.

By V. A. V. Carr
(&amp;apos;Continued from p. 306)
In these times of national disrupture, both in domestic affairs
and business, one's first instinct is to turn to a more enlightening
subject, and if one's tendencies lean that way, feathered creatures
are much more near and dear to all of us. I suppose, speaking
without any authority on the subject, the importing of foreign
birds will be more or less suspended for a time at any rate, because
of the difficulties of international transport. But, thank goodness,
we have our own native birds to interest us and to my way of
thinking there is as much, if not more, to know and learn about
them. The range of our observations is so very broad--both
in different families of Britishers, and different places. If one has
the birds in captivity one can go, in the majority of cases, a few
yards or miles to see the same species enjoying life, whether it
be hot or cold.
The breeding of most of our native birds smaller than, and
including, the Magpie, is also easy, providing one has a fairly
good imitation of the bird's natural building site. For instance,
it is no good attempting to breed Wheatears in bushes, or to breed
Magpies in a hole in the ground. In my last contribution I out-
lined a few ideas of how one can best adapt a small (or large)
aviary for breeding purposes, and I hope I achieved my object by
pointing out a few simple hints which can be followed up and
improved upon, if one has the idea of how to start.
After one has the aviary ready, I suppose the next thing is
to stock it suitably with pairs of birds. This, then, leads us to the
different sexes. As a general rule the male bird is always the
best and brightest coloured, and a little larger than the female.
But there are a few British Finches that are difficult to sex, and if
one intends breeding at a later date it is imperative to know for
sure that you are suitably accommodated.
I should say that the Goldfinch, Redpoll, Twite, and Linnet
are very difficult for the inexperienced and only at close quarters
can be sexed with any accuracy.
The hen Goldfinch has small brown feathers on the butt of

the wing, while the cock has black ones. Another certain means
of identification is by the colour of the whiskers on the bird's
mandible. On a hen bird these are a buff or straw colour, while
the cock's are black.
Redpolls are difficult. As a general rule the cock bird has a
faint pink on the surface of the breast feathers. In exceptional
cases of aviary-bred birds the colour is sometimes very pronounced,
whilst field moulted birds have a very beautiful red coloration--
losing it when moulted in captivity.
The hen has little, if any, colour on its breast either noticeably
so or under the surface. The bib of the hen bird is a lot larger,
broader, and a denser black in comparison to the male.
Cock Twites, when field moulted, have a vivid red rump, but
the hen lacks this. Again, when moulted in captivity, this dis-
appears. Aviary moulted birds can only be sexed by the white
on the primary wing feathers. On a male, these are very large
and pronounced, the hen's being quite a bit less pronounced.
This also applies to Linnets, and so does the red coloration
on the breast feathers, resembling the Redpoll, both aviary moulted
and field moulted.
Every hardbill comes into its adult plumage the same year it
is born--after its first moult--and then one can sex the birds.
This does not apply to some softbilled birds, such as the Nightingale,
Wheatear, Whinchat, Stonechat, Spotted and Pied Flycatchers,
Dartford Warbler, Red-backed Shrike, and some species of Wag-
tails. These come into colour in the spring, and it is necessary
to keep these birds for half the year before one can tell with any
assurance what is what.
The majority of the softbills I have mentioned (with the
exception of the Shrike, this being to some extent a flesh eater)
will do in a mixed aviary and will agree quite well with hardbills.
But on no account place two cock birds in the same aviary for
they will fight to the death. Robins, Redstarts, and Nightingales
are the worst offenders in this respect, and they are not too particular
as to whether they go for any other species, be it hard or softbilled.
As in other branches of aviculture, the feeding problem for
rearing youngsters successfully is as great and very much the
same. Seeds soaked and then allowed to sprout for a day or two
can be given to both adult and young birds, in the former case

combining green food with the once hard seed, and in the case
of the young birds giving them food more easily digested. It is
interesting to note that only a few species of hardbills feed their
young with seed and green food and nothing else. The others
feed chiefly with insects, and the more live food a parent bird can
get prior to and during the time of rearing, the better will be the
youngster. Wrong and lazy feeding at this stage of our feathered
friends, means a short life and not a very merry one.
A fairly good explanation to a novice of a hardbill and softbill
is this : a hardbill feeds its young from its crop ; a softbill carries
its food in its beak and gives it directly to its young ones without
an intermediary process of semi-digestion in the crop. This
cc explanation 55 is about the best one to give ; but then certain hard-
bills carry the food to their youngsters in the beak. All species
of Buntings, Chaffinch, Brambling, Siskin, Hawfinch, and Twite
do this, although they are typical hardbills. But such is Nature,
having very perverse habits at times.
So, if there is a hardbill that feeds its young as a softbill, it is
essential that live food should be given to the parent birds whenever
one thinks fit--but more particularly regularly when rearing young
--if success is to be assured.
I know this live food required during the breeding season is a
very difficult problem, more particularly if, as I am, the enthusiastic
ornithologist is not an entomologist. I believe these people can
breed anything they want almost, in this respect, catching female
moths and " housing 55 them in linen cloths tied round birch or
sallow trees and then leaving them for a month or so until the
caterpillars have reached a useful size. I have to content myself
with gentles (thoroughly scoured in bran, sand, or sawdust),
mealworms, and ants eggs (live). The latter are ideal and if
collected from the nest and placed in a tin floating on a larger tin,
the ants are unable to carry the eggs away.

Mr. C. L. Sibley sends the following report :--
" At the Hialeah race track at Miami, Florida, there are several
lakes in the infield, and Swans, Storks, Scarlet Ibis, and other birds,
including a flock of 265 Flamingoes, make their home there and add
interest and colour to this, perhaps the most beautiful race track in
the world. In spite of having been at home here for a goodly number
of years, no nesting was attempted until in 1936 one egg was laid
and a young bird hatched, but it soon died.
" This year, 1939, a large number of birds nested, and at the
present time (July) there are thirty-eight young in various stages of
growth, some of them well along towards maturity. These are
the Phmicopterus ruber, from South America.
" The birds are fed on a diet of boiled rice, shrimp, wheat, and
cod-liver oil. Besides this, they doubtless get more or less food from
the lake in which they live. The climate is exceedingly mild there,
and evidently conditions agree well with the birds."
A few weeks later Mr. Sibley reported further :--
" A friend in Florida writes that he has visited the colony and
has handled eggs and seen young birds from newly hatched chicks
to those several weeks old. Earlier, about sixty nests were flooded
and the eggs destroyed. Since Flamingoes lay only one egg, this
meant an equal number of eggs spoiled. Even so, there are about
100 youngsters of various ages, I am told."
This is apparently the first occasion that Ruddy Flamingoes
have bred in captivity, though certainly the conditions at the
Hialeah race track must be regarded as captivity in the widest
term of the word. In the Berlin Zoo the birds succeeded so far as
laying eggs, as was described by Dr. Georg Steinbacher in the
following : " Some observations on the breeding of Phmicopterus
ruber in the Berlin Zoological Gardens," published in the March,
1938, number of Beitrage zur Fortpflanzungs-biologie der Vogel mit
Berucksichtigung der Oologie. A translation of his observations is as

" In a large flock of Ruddy Flamingoes, which were ringed in
January, 1937, six birds remained in pairs up to April. Unfortu-
nately, further observations could not be made, as the rings were
bitten off by the birds, but some pairs certainly remained together
longer. The fact of their remaining together after the breeding
season permits one to presume that Flamingoes pair for life. In the
case of these supposed pairs one bird was always larger than the
other. Although Flamingoes live in large flocks, they are by no
means peaceful, but fight a great deal among themselves. Whenever
they are angry, the long pointed feathers on the back are erected
and beaks loudly clattered. This clattering can also be heard
when the Flamingoes are quiet, but desire to fly to another spot.
It assists to stimulate them to flight. One bird starts, another
joins in, and the clattering quickens until the birds begin to rise.
As their wings are clipped they naturally do not get far. The
warning note, on the other hand, which is heard when the bird is
alarmed, is a nasal " Aah aah ", accompanied by the plumage
being contracted and the neck stretched out. If the danger passes
without serious disturbance, the birds often react by clattering.
Each evening the Flamingoes endeavour, amid loud clattering,
to make a general change of position. They run and flutter about
for some time. These flights are similar to the restless flutterings
of our small caged birds before darkness descends, and corresponds
to the flight from the day feeding grounds to the more secure resting-
places for the night.
" Pairings were observed from the middle of May, but they were
relatively rare. In most cases there was a prelude, during which
the larger male pursued the smaller female closely and tried to
cover her. The female finally ran in narrow circles, the male close
behind, pressing at the same time his breast against the back of the
female. He then covered the female, who stood still. During
copulation the male balanced himself slightly with his wings.
" On the 1st June, 1934, 6th July, 1936, and 5th June, 1937,
respectively, an egg was laid. One egg measured 1 o 1 * 2 X 55 \0x25A0 3 mm.
and weighed 172 grams. Unfortunately they were always unfertile.
" The first egg lay on a flat stone at the edge of the pond, where
the bird had built a low circular wall of earth. The birds laid the
other two in artificial nests of stone, which were placed in shallow
water and which, after the egg was laid, were covered with clay

by the keeper. These nests were more or less circular with a diameter
and height of about 40 cm., and with a shallow depression in the
centre ; they were mostly in groups of three. They were each
immediately taken possession of by a pair of Flamingoes, several
pairs fighting for possession for some time. The Flamingoes busied
themselves with the nests, smoothing the clay covering with their
beaks and piling sand and mud on the outer edge of the clay
cavity and smoothing it likewise. The development of the nest
cavity progressed so well, that the bird now occupied itself by
carrying nesting material from the water to the artificial nest in
its beak. Then it took up position on the edge of the nest, head
hanging down so that it reached the middle of the nest. At the
same time it stamped quickly and firmly against the wall of the
nest, welding it well together. Then it got into the nest cavity
and turned on the spot, its downward-hanging head describing
a circle over the wall of the nest. In this way the bird trod the inside
of the nest firm.
" Male and female brooded the eggs, the latter, however, longer
than the former. The sitting bird was relieved by its mate approach-
ing the nest. The birds greeted one another with clattering
beaks, then the sitting bird rose up and waded away. The new-
comer stood over the egg, straightened it with its beak and let itself
carefully down on it. To all appearances it pushed its toes, as the
majority of the birds do, under the egg. I have never seen a
Flamingo with its legs hanging down to the right and left of the
nest, as is described by old authors. The chief duty of defence
of the nest is left to the male. In the numerous encounters which
every pair of Flamingoes has to face with the others of the flock,
the male is always much more active than the female. The male
of a pair which tried to breed in 1936 proved an exception. He was
abnormally peaceful. So it came about that the birds after laying
were chased from the nest by a more belligerent pair. The former
took another nest for a short time. The pair which had taken over
the egg left it without a struggle to a third pair after one day and
took another artificial nest. The third pair incubated the egg for
some time."

A lovely pair of these rather large, but beautiful Pigeons was
brought over about three years ago by the well-known collector,
Mr. W. Frost, from North-West New Guinea. These birds were
kept in a large cage for two weeks, after which time they were
turned out into a large aviary containing a number of other birds.
They showed no signs of nesting until this year, and although there
were numerous nesting baskets and trays placed on the walls of
the sleeping quarters in the aviary, this pair of Pigeons were con-
tinually fighting a pair of Snow Pigeons for possession of a nesting
tray measuring about 1 foot square and ij inches deep, which
was hanging on the wall 9 feet from the floor. First the Snow
Pigeons would place a few sticks on the tray and then the Banded
Fruit Pigeons would place a few more. To give these Pigeons
every chance of nesting the Snow Pigeons were removed and two days
later the nest was completed, and on the 12th June, an egg was
laid. This was a shade larger than a domestic Pigeon's egg. Both
parents took turns at incubating, and on 3rd July the empty shell
was found on the floor of the aviary. It was impossible to see the
young one as the parents sat too tightly. The first time the young
one was seen was when it was ten days old, and then only the head
and shoulders could be seen. Four days later, on 17th July, the
young one left the nest, being almost the size of the parents, but
lacking the band across the breast. These Pigeons were fed on
minced fruit, which was mixed with fine biscuit meal, which
prevents the bird's feathers getting messed up. The fruit minced
consists of bananas, oranges, apples, figs, dates, and dried pears,
and to this is added boiled rice and mashed potato. The young
bird is now as big as the parents and the breast band is as clear as
that of the parents. I am pleased to be the first to breed this
beautiful Pigeon.

A winter noted for its persistent night frosts, followed by such
weather as is described by Longfellow when--
" The day is cold and dark and dreary
It rains, and the wind is never weary."
made me decide to keep my more sensitive birds indoors until
May. It may be foolish to do this as certainly the birds' plumage
suffers, also nesting operations are delayed. But the gloriously
warm burst at the end of May seemed to bring birds quickly into
condition ; had they been turned out earlier this might not have
been the case.
The adult Gouldians came out of their moult quickly, and look
in fine form--though dilatory about going to nest. The young ones
have donned their adult plumage at nine months, and look more
lovely than their parents. The Shama hen went to nest at once,
but, I imagine through the cock's fault, eleven eggs have proved
unfertile.
As she was likely to nest again I told my trouble to a well-known
aviculturist. He solved them by lending me his cock, showing that
peculiar sympathy one meets with. The sprightly little hen is
now brooding a large clutch of eggs. The Violet-eared cock's
bright attire will be complete as soon as " bib and tucker " have
been added, his wife was certainly dressed first. Though he can
be heard daily trilling his lark-like song I fancy the Violet-ears
will adhere to their original habit of nesting in the autumn.
Three months ago I was persuaded to buy two pairs of Emblema
Picta Finches--quite recently imported. To my dismay one cock
died at once, he arrived suffering from a severe moult. The other
three were put out into a small aviary at the end of May. One
hen laid almost at once--I think, five eggs. From this nest three
nice young birds are on the wing (July). They are almost as big
as their parents. I felt it was a great risk leaving two hens with
one cock--that it might have been with him a case of " How happy

could I be with either, and the other dear Charmer away ! 55 --
that some tragedy might happen to " put her away But this
Painted Finch cock has altered my previous experience of these
birds, and the opinions I have read. He has proved himself equal
to the best traditions of Australian Finches. He is full of life and
second to none in colouring and attractiveness.
He knows all about running his establishment peaceably.
When he was on the nest, both hens were off, and all through the
incubating period, and afterwards, one of the three was in the
nest on duty. They all appear to have helped to feed the babies.
These birds never roost on the ground. They go down a great deal,
especially where the soil has been disturbed and seeds are to be
found germinating, and possibly minute grubs. The cock samples
all seeds, he does not confine himself to one kind. All good finch
mixtures and especially the large white Italian millet and the
spray are much liked. Fresh seeding grass and that which has
dried a bit, finely pounded eggshell, cuttlefish, and the powdered
charcoal are essential. Sometimes soaked seed has been taken.
The cock very much believes in baths.
A finch-box was provided, but these birds (like many others)
forsake these for a dome-shaped rush nest with a small opening.
These we make at home. These are placed in the fork of a branch
which is firmly fixed high in the covered aviary, or they can rest
in a small basket hung high up--the latter plan has found greater
acceptance.
I strongly recommend these birds for their tameness and
attractiveness.

With the volume commencing in November, 1909, a third
series began under the editorship of Frank Finn who, however,
resigned with the July number when J. L. Bonhote took it on.
It commences with a coloured plate of the Abyssinian Lovebird
(Agapornis taranta), a species that was practically unknown to
aviculture at the time and has not become common since.
E. J. Brook describes the successful breeding in his aviaries
at Hoddam Castle of the Black Lory ( Chalcopsittacus ater ), the first
ever reared in confinement.
R. A. Holden gives an account of the breeding in his aviaries
of the Spotted-backed Weaver ( Hyphantornis spilonotus ), a South
African species that is rarely imported in the usual way. Young
were hatched, but unfortunately, not successfully reared. " Many
of the Weavers," writes Mr. Holden, " show a decided preference,
when building, for branches which overhang water, and I imagine
that H. spilonotus is no exception. My birds have for a bath a
shallow earthenware dish, perhaps a foot in diameter, and one
of the first nests was built directly over this. The dish was, from
motives of curiosity, twice moved and on each occasion weaving
was commenced directly above it."
The Duchess of Bedford gives an account of the nesting results
at Woburn during 1909. Manchurian Cranes nested there for
the first time and one young bird was hatched and was thriving
when the account was written. Hutchin's Geese also nested for
the first time and reared their young, and Pekin Robins ( Liothrix ),
which had been at large in the Park for a year, bred.
Reginald Phillipps describes the successful breeding of the
Quail Finch ( Ortygospiza poly zona). He writes, " If there be but
a blade of green grass in the aviary, under that bit of greenery he
will build his nest--or nowhere. Oh, the number of nests my
old male has had destroyed by the rain during these last three
summers ! Nevertheless, he has never given up ; and now, at
last, his perseverance has been rewarded, for three fledglings,

strong on the wing and stout of foot, have left the nest : surely
his pluck is worthy of being immortalized in the pages of the
Avicultural Magazine."
W. E. Teschemaker describes the successful breeding in his
aviaries of the Blue Grosbeak ( Guiraca cyanea). His attempts to
breed this species extended over five years during which time his
birds laid no less than twelve clutches of eggs, the twelfth time
being successful. He came to the conclusion that to nest success-
fully, the species must have a fairly large aviary, in which there
is likely to be trouble should any other species attempt to nest
in their neighbourhood. The same writer also gives a long and
interesting account of the successful breeding of the Giant Whydah
(Chera progne) which he does not consider a difficult subject in
a suitable aviary where there is plenty of long grass.
The year was a particularly successful one for Teschemaker
and his collection must have been of absorbing interest and delight
for besides those mentioned above, he successfully bred the Blackcap
(i Sylvia atricapilla) , the Red-whiskered Bulbul ( Otocompsa jocosa ),
and the Grey-headed Sparrow (. Passer diffusus) . Of the first of
these he writes : "Just as the Blackcap is by far the hardiest of
the Warblers, so it is, I think, very much the least difficult to breed.
The fact that our member Mr. Suggitt reared a fine brood (only
a fortnight after I succeeded) shows that the experiment is quite
a feasible one : on the other hand the fact that both he and I and,
I think, other aviculturists also have had many failures shows
that the Blackcap is not bred every day."
A coloured plate by Gronvold illustrates a pair of attractive
hybrids between the Crimson Finch ( Neochmia phaeton) and the
Star Finch (. Bathilda ruficauda ) bred in Hubert Astley's aviaries
at his villa in Italy.
Flamingoes are from time to time reported on the coasts and
open pieces of water in this country and there is little doubt that
most if not all of these are escapes from zoos or private collections.
Here is an account which I contributed to the volume under notice,
of one that escaped from the Zoo : " On 17th November (1909)
the water in the pond was drawn off for cleaning and a gang of
navvies appeared with brooms and shovels. This rather scared the
Flamingoes and one managed to clear the boundary fence, circled
round two or three times in the air and then throwing out its

long neck forward and its long legs aft, headed straight away to
the south and vanished out of sight. Nothing more was heard of
it that day, but on the following morning a report was brought in
that the bird was walking in Regent's Park. I at once summoned
four keepers, and arming myself with a long net, set out in search
of the truant. We soon discovered it walking in stately fashion
on the grass.
" As we approached it became uneasy and hastened its steps,
and before we had approached within 40 yards it extended its
wings and commenced to run. With slowly flapping pinions it
soon got under way and gradually rose from the ground, a wonderful
object in the bright morning sunshine, its jet black pinions con-
trasting beautifully with its pink plumage. With neck and legs
in a straight line it sailed away towards the lake and soon became
a mere speck in the distance. We saw it wheel to the left over
the lake and vanish from sight in the distant mist. We made in
the direction in which the bird had disappeared, but did not have
to go very far, for again our bird appeared heading directly for us
and gradually approaching the ground ; down it came gently to
earth and sank upon its breast with expanded wings, exhausted.
" We picked it up without the aid of the net before it could
recover, none the worse for its flight. We had had a beautiful
exhibition of the flight of this majestic bird under the most
advantageous conditions."
T. H. Newman describes the successful breeding of the White-
throated Pigeon (Columba albigularis ), a rare species from New
Guinea, which he considers " the most beautiful member of the
finest group of typical Pigeons, to which the sub-generic name
Ianthoenas has been given One egg only was laid in the nest, a
habit common to several of the large fruit-eating Pigeons, and
although late in the season it hatched and the young bird grew
to be a fine specimen.
A beautiful coloured plate by Goodchild depicts a pair of
Purple Sugar-birds (Coereba coerulea ), while Frank Finn contributes
an article on this species and its relative, the Yellow-winged Sugar-
bird (C. cyanea ), which is much more frequently imported.

Paradise, with which he was very familiar in their wild state. This

plumage into this country and the massacre of the full-plumaged
males was going on unchecked. He says : " The collector of
Customs kindly gave me the returns for the first year (since the
establishment of customs), which amounted to roughly 1,100 skins
of apodas. These figures would include only those sent away in
bulk. There would certainly be more taken out in personal luggage
and not declared. . . . The apodas resort to the same dancing trees
year after year, and at the commencement of the season (March)
the owners of the trees are able, before the birds' plumes are quite
mature, to estimate almost to a skin the number they will obtain
when shooting commences. A chief once told me that the preceding
year he was only one bird out in his calculations, more or less,
I quite forget now. This really means that each year possibly not
one full-plumaged bird escapes."
A very excellent coloured plate of the Cock-of-the-Rock
(Rupicola rupicola) by Goodchild illustrates an admirable article
by W. Frost on his experiences of this extraordinary bird in its
wild state in British Guiana. He describes the nest which was
" stuck to the face of a large overhanging boulder, fourteen feet
up, on a small, sharply sloping ledge. . . . On close inspection the
nest appeared to be built of fibrous material, probably from a palm,
worked up with some gelatinous substance and plastered on the
outside with dried lichen or moss ; in shape, forming about two-
thirds of a circle ".
The boulders amongst which the Cocks-of-the-Rock are to be
found " vary in size from that of a small cottage to, say, that of the
Albert Hall. The whole formation of the range indeed reminds
one of nothing so much as a gigantic stone wall from which the
top courses have been dislodged, forming a heap of debris all along
the foot, over and under and through which one has to struggle
like a stray ant until one comes to the wall itself, running up sheer
some hundreds of feet. Over all is the thick, dark, tangle of bush,
the sort of trail that even the Indians shirk, although swarming
with game.
" Near the top of the slope, close under the wall, we found the
dancing places. ... I found the birds danced fairly regularly every
morning between eight and ten a.m. . . . During the time I remained
on the range I watched perhaps some thirty or forty dances. They
were always started by an old cock who, taking up a position on

a horizontal or slightly sloping branch, a fallen one preferably,
at a height of from three to four feet, would start squawking over-
head. Presently he would start jumping back and forth from his
perch to the ground, giving a quick swirl with open wings and tail
as he struck the ground and turned to regain the branch. One
after another the other cocks would join in, sitting opposite the first
and taking turns in the jumps, squawking the usual challenge.
The excitement spreading, the rest would gradually fall into place
until with seven or eight birds flashing up and down, faster and
faster, it began to look something like a dance. I cannot say that
I ever saw a hen anywhere near during the dance, though, of course,
they may have been watching the game from overhead in the thick
foliage."

Birds in the Copenhagen Zoo.
Mr. P. H. Maxwell sends the following note of his visit to the Copenhagen Zoo r
The gardens were looking very beautiful when we visited them. The Bird House
was a small pavilion-like structure with two large cages at either end depicting
an African and another scene. These both were unoccupied when we visited it.
The small birds are placed in cages at one side of the House and the larger ones
on the other side with outside aviaries. The Humming-birds looked very attractive
in their special small cage with tropical plants. In the House I saw such interesting
birds as the Great Bird of Paradise and the Red Bird of Paradise, also a beautiful
specimen of the Purple-throated Continga {Continga cay ana) from Guiana and the
Amazon, this bird is very seldom imported to Europe. There was a single specimen
of the China Pitta. The other inhabitants of particular interest included two-
Blue-backed Manakins (Chiroxiphiapareola), a Paradise Tanager {Callisteparadisea)
and Fire-Tufted Barbet (Psilophon pyrolophus) , a Racquet-tailed Drongo ( Dissemurus
paradiseus) . Among the larger birds in the House were some Tinamous with one-
young one, also some Vulturine Guinea Fowl. In various paddocks and cages,
about the grounds were Emus, Sarus Cranes, Flamingoes, Peacocks, a Cassowary
and one American Vulture in the Mammal Flouse. The Ducks had a beautiful
shaded lake surrounded by trees.

BREEDING OF MEALWORMS

<bodyText confidence="0.885799058823529" page_id="56323034"  page_num="374" year="" vol="">
I have just written a note to Cage Birds in answer to an article appearing in
that periodical on " Live Food and Substitutes
The gist of my letter is that there is at present no known substitute for meal-
worms, and I would like to suggest that the present time, when there is no competi-
tion from the Continent, would be a good time to start a " factory " on a large
scale for the production of this indispensable larva.
From what I have heard of the German methods of breeding mealworms, it
transpires that large numbers of men, women, and children are employed in
their production.
It is obviously not a trade which requires much activity, and it seems to
me that this might be a useful method of employing a number of disabled men
and women who are already in this country, and possibly more who, alas ! will
be available before long. The ways and means of such an enterprise I should
leave to those with more business acumen than myself, but the whole matter
might be discussed if and when the Council meets again, and I would suggest
that ordinary members of the Society be invited to be present in order that we
might have their suggestions.

A SCHEME TO MAINTAIN A STOCK OF THE RARE SPECIES OF

aviculture generally, and the keeping of waterfowl in particular. Quite apart
from the graver issues which are at stake, it seems particularly hard that after
all the work and endeavour put forward by Messrs. Stevens and others to procure
and establish new species of the family Anatidae for collections in England, the
keeping of waterfowl should have received such a set-back.
With so many species now available there never was a time when the beauty
of waterfowl was more appreciated, or the study of this interesting group of
birds more popular than it is to-day. That being the case, I only hope that
some of us may be able to concentrate upon the things worth keeping, and keep
the best species going. My own view is that all the British species, except the
very rarest are not for the time being worth a moment's consideration, and
can be picked up by whoever requires them at the end of the war.
Several foreign species which have been many years with us are comparatively
safe, too, provided that we do not all part with or keep the same. With this end in
view, I put forward the suggestion, if not too late, that waterfowl keepers get
together, take a rough census of the material available, and try to lend a guiding
hand.

(B. macgillivrayi)
By Alan Lendon, F.R.C.S.
My recent acquisition for the first time, after several years of
endeavour, of a specimen of the Cloncurry Parrakeet, has prompted
me to write the following review of this interesting genus of Australian
Broadtailed Parrakeets. The most recent edition of the Australian
Checklist recognizes four species, namely, the Twenty-eight or
Yellow-naped Parrakeet, B. semitorquatus , the Port Lincoln or
Bauer's Parrakeet, B. zonarius, the Mallee Ringneck or Barnard's
Parrakeet, B. barnardi, and the Cloncurry Parrakeet, B. macgillivrayi.
The members of the genus are widely distributed over the main-
land of Australia, and Spencer's Gulf and the 138 th meridian of
longitude roughly divides the range of the two western or black-
headed species from that of the two eastern or green-headed forms.
The first three mentioned species are well known in captivity in
England and all appear to have been bred there. Strangely enough,
no member of this genus appears to have been bred by a member
of the Avicultural Society of South Australia, although several
hybrids between the species and with other Broadtails are on
record. The reason is, I think, that although they are commonly
kept in captivity in South Australia, it is seldom that an aviary
is devoted to a pair of these birds. More frequently, they are kept
as cage pets, making, as they do, quite good whistlers. To deal
with the individual species in the order named above :--

The Twenty-eight Parrakeet, B. semitorquatus. -- A typical
example of a male of this species is a very large bird with a well-
marked red frontal band and a uniform pale green abdomen.
It appears to be confined to the south-western portion of Western
Australia. The female is a smaller bird, especially as to the size
of the head and beak and generally has only a little red obvious in
the frontal region, also the black head is rather less intense in
colour.
The Port Lincoln Parrakeet, B. zonarius .--A typical male
as obtained from the Eyre's Peninsula or west coast district of
South Australia is a smaller bird than the preceding, lacking the
red frontal band and having a pale lemon yellow abdomen. In
addition, the green coloration has a much bluer tinge than in
the Twenty-eight. This I find is particularly noticeable in the
females which otherwise I find difficult to sex with any degree
of certainty, though other helpful points are the size of the head
and beak and the intensity of the black head. This bird has a very
wide range extending westward to that of the former, where over
a wide area intermediate forms are encountered ; also north-
westward to the coast where the pale form, described by North
as a distinct ;pecies, B. occidentalism occurs. Never having seen
this form in life, I do not feel disposed to offer any opinion as to
whether its retention as a species is warranted. Skins that I have
seen so labelled merely give the impression of a very faded Port
Lincoln. In Western Australia all Black-headed Ringnecks are
called " Twenty-eights 55 quite irrespective of markings or habitat,
but I have never yet seen a typically marked Port Lincoln that
possessed the " Twenty-eight " call note.
The Mallee Parrakeet, B. barnardi. -- This species has an
extensive range through eastern South Australia, the interior of
Victoria and New South Wales into Southern Queensland where
the town of Windorah is said to be its northern recorded limit.
Certainly it does not extend north of the tropic of Capricorn.
It is a common bird in the Mallee districts of South Australia and
the local form has a rather ill-defined narrow orange band across
the lower breast and a good deal of dusky feathering on the head.
A typical New South Wales bird on the other hand has a broader
pale yellow breast band, a lighter coloured head, and the general
breast coloration is a paler green. As a rule the species is easy

to sex, the females being generally duller and much greener on
the back.
The Glongurry Parrakeet, B. macgillivrayi .--This species,
which is practically unknown to aviculturists, was not described
until 1900. As far as is known, it has a comparatively restricted
range in North-Western Queensland, the southern limit of which
is not known and no intermediate forms between this species and
the preceding have been described. It is well portrayed by the
coloured plate that appeared in the Ibis for 1902 which is repro-
duced in this number of the Avicultural Magazine. Good paintings
also appeared in the Emu , vol. 29, plate 1, and in Gregory Mathews
Birds of Australia , vol. vi. My efforts to obtain examples of this
species may be of interest. When in Sydney in January, 1936,
I learned from one of the leading dealers that he had recently
had a small consignment of Cloncurrys for the first time ; he was,
however, unable to trace any of them for my inspection. Some
months later, through the help of a friend in Sydney, several of
these birds were brought down to Brisbane, destined for me.
Having got so far, they came under the notice of a well-known
English collector who happened to be in Brisbane at the time,
and shortly afterwards became his property. Although they passed
through Adelaide, I was unaware of the fact until later and missed
the opportunity of even seeing them. I have since heard that they
did not reach England alive. Nothing further eventuated until
early this year when two more pairs were taken to America from
Brisbane and more were promised to me. Then in March of this
year I was surprised to learn that there was a specimen in the
collection of Mr. Oscar Seppelt, a member of the Avicultural
Society. Mr. Seppelt's collection was at that time being broken
up and he was good enough to let me have the bird which had
only been in his possession for a few weeks. He told me that he
had made several previous attempts to obtain specimens direct
from North Queensland and that this bird was the first to arrive
alive, so the credit for the introduction of the species to South
Australian aviculture must go to him. The bird under consideration
is, I think, a male but I am by no means positive. At present,
it is sharing an aviary with a pair of Barraband's and takes very
little notice of two pairs of Barnard's Parrakeets in an adjoining-
aviary, nor for that matter, do they appear interested in it. It is

a smallish bird, about the size of an Eastern Rosella (Platycercus
eximius ), and the pale green body coloration and slightly bluish
head are quite attractive. So far I have only heard it utter one
call note which is identical with the alarm note of the Port Lincoln.
The bird has probably been hand-reared as it is fairly tame and
will accept food from the hand. Failing being able to obtain a mate
I intend trying to pair it up with either a Port Lincoln or a Barnard's.
It has always been assumed that the species is most closely related
to the Barnard's, but my own impression is that it is possibly
nearer the Port Lincoln ; in fact for those who have not access
to a coloured plate it might aptly be described as a small pale
Port Lincoln with a bluish-green head and without any trace
whatever of the red frontal band of the Barnard's.

I am delighted to see so many people are keeping up their
interest in birds, and still have very good collections. So far there
has not been much difficulty in getting most of the feeding stuffs,
and I am hoping that we shall always be able to get something
to keep birds going. Mealworms seem to arrive regularly from
Holland, and gentles are always obtainable. My avairies were
very full in August, and now I have taken over a good many
birds belonging to my friends, so the aviaries are overflowing.
I am determined to do all I can to keep my collection going, and
I hope everybody else will try and do the same. It has taken us
years to get such a beautiful lot of birds, and it would be a shame
to have to destroy them. It may be a very long time before collectors
will be able to get birds from abroad even after the war is over
so we must try to keep all we can. I have never had so many
birds as I have now--besides my aviary birds, I have over 200
Mandarin and Carolina ducks, all full winged and flying about
from one pond to another. Any number of Chukor partridges in
my garden, also jungle fowl, Tigrine doves, and some Silver
Pheasants in the park. I sincerely hope all members will keep
their birds, and also keep up their interest in the Society and help
us all to keep things going through these difficult times.

There are some people who never seem happy unless a thing
sounds--or unless they can make it sound---just as complicated
as possible, in rather the same way as any doctor will tell you that
many of his patients entirely refuse to believe that the medicine
he gives them will do them the slightest good unless it tastes as
unpleasant as possible.
Now with regard to the housing of Parrakeets, I am bound to
confess that their successful breeding and keeping is not to be
achieved by anything at all complicated or elaborate in the way
of their accommodation. Actually their needs in this respect are
simple, although it is essential that certain fundamental rules
should be understood and observed. Thus, ornamental scroll
work and eagles rampant in bronze to ornament the four corners
of the aviary may be decorative, but they won't induce the inmates
to breed successfully !
Firstly as to movability. Doubtless there are still champions
of the fixed aviary, but I do not think even they would dispute
the fact that quite large Parrakeets can be bred in quarters of
very much more modest dimensions if these are movable than
would be the case if they were on a fixed site. If movable aviaries
are an impossibility, however, obviously the larger the space
occupied by the fixed aviary the better, since the ground will
take all the longer to become stale.
Alternatively, of course, an aviary with a washable tiled or
concrete floor to the outside run could be tried.
We have had excellent breeding results here at Keston
with any Parrakeets up to the size of a Rosella in aviaries whose
overall dimensions are 15 feet by 5 feet by 7 feet, but I cannot
too strongly stress the fact that these are moved annually, not on
to entirely fresh ground each year, but to and fro alternate years,
the vacated site being heavily limed and salted before it is occupied
again twelve months later. This serves to clean and disinfect the
ground and also encourages the growth of grass and discourages
the more noxious weeds.

When we first tried this principle I was delighted with the
breeding results, but at the same time wondered whether the
alternate aviary sites would not gradually become stale and
possibly lead eventually to infertility. As, however, some of these
aviaries have now been in use from ten to twelve years, and the
1939 Parrakeet breeding results were quite as good, if not better,
than any experienced before, I feel that one's doubts on this point
can be finally allayed.
Roughly speaking, an aviary for Parrakeets should consist of
a dry, well-lighted, draught proof wooden shelter, adjoining an
outside wire flight. As Parrakeets in most cases intensely dislike
driving winter rain and wind, it is important that they should be
provided with somewheie to sit that is in the open air and yet
fairly protected and under cover.
This is most easily achieved by roofing over the top and boarding
down the sides of the one-third of the flight actually joining the
shelter shed. In this way the birds can either sit completely protected
in the shelter, or out of doors yet under cover, or again in the
entirely open part of the flight. One very common error is to roof
over the whole of the outside flight, and this is the greatest mistake
in the world, as nothing is better for a bird's plumage than a good
shower of rain.
To realize this one has only to compare the condition of the
plumage of a Parrot that is kept indoors without being either
sprayed or put out in a shower of rain, with that of one living
under the aviary conditions already described. Such a caged
bird may not actually appear in bad condition, but it usually
entirely lacks the final bloom and gloss which characterizes the
plumage of an outdoor aviary specimen.
Quite apart from the benefit to the birds themselves, it is well
worth while keeping them as I have advised, if only for the pleasure
it will afford their owner to watch the positive transports of joy
in which members of the Parrot family indulge when taking a
rain bath in the open. Roseate and other Cockatoos are particularly
lovely as they fling up their crests, bristle their feathers and spread
their wings, reminding one of great gaudy butterflies as they turn
this way and that to make sure that the moisture shall penetrate
to every part of their plumage. Among Grass Parrakeets Bourke's
are by far the most enthusiastic rain bathers, and there are few

prettier spectacles than these chaste yet lovely little birds at such a
time.
The actual design of the aviary will, of course, have to be
modified according to the nature of the site upon which it is to be
erected. For instance, if it can face south in a situation in which
it receives natural protection--in the form of trees or hedges--
from the prevailing wind, a single wooded shelter and an open
run is really quite sufficient. If, on the other hand, the only available
site is an exposed one such as a large open lawn or meadow, it is as
well to have the shed double wooded and to board up that side
of the flight which is going to get the full blast of the prevailing
wind. Such details of construction, however, are really best left
to the ingenuity of the individual aviculturist.
The wire run should be constructed of half-inch mesh netting,
and I have often been asked why, for birds such as the larger
Broadtails, such a small mesh is necessary, since obviously a bird
such as a Rosella could be confined in wire of considerably larger
mesh without any fear of its escaping. Actually, the answer to this
is two-fold. Firstly, half-inch mesh netting will exclude such
dangerous vermin as rats, stoats, and weasels, and secondly--and
this is a point that is often overlooked--a person may erect an
aviary primarily for Parrakeets and later on may want to house
in it small Finches or Waxbills, which they would, of course, be
unable to do if they had used anything but half-inch mesh netting.
Some of the larger Parrakeets, such as Bauers, etc., can bite
through netting of this gauge, particularly as soon as it begins to
get at all old. For these it is a good plan to tack a width of stout
1-inch mesh netting round the whole of the top of that half of
the run where the perches are, as they usually sit on a perch and
whittle away at the wire beside it. Incidentally, it may be of
interest to mention in passing that, although both Brown's and
Rosellas hardly ever damage wire netting, I have some cock
Brown's X Rosella hybrids bred two years ago which are the most
expert wire cutters, being quite as efficient in this respect as any
Bauer ! They set about it, too, in an extremely methodical manner,
but this only bears out my contention that hybrid Parrakeets, like
mongrel dogs, are often unusually intelligent.
Black Cockatoos incidentally can only be confined in link mesh
netting, such as is extensively used at the London Zoo.

The wire of the run of a fixed aviary should, of course, be
buried in the ground and it is a good plan to dig a trench to bury
it at least 18 inches deep turning it outwards at the bottom for
another 6 inches. This tends to thwart anything trying to burrow
into the aviary.
Much the best method of construction for a movable flight,
however, is to have the bottom wired over in the same way as the
sides and top. The grass will quickly grow up through this wire
floor, and it has the great advantage of making an aviary entirely
vermin-proof. Rats may, and frequently do, burrow round the
aviary with the idea of gaining entrance underneath, but this is
barred as soon as they come up against the wire netting. This,
of course, means that none of the uprights of the run are, as in the
case of a fixed aviary, let into the ground and particularly in a
very windy situation it is sometimes advisable to drive iron stakes
into the ground flush against two of the uprights, and bolted to
them so that they can easily be removed.
The most important thing to remember about the perches is
that these should never be allowed to clutter up the whole of
the aviary, as this merely prevents the inmates making full use
of its flying space. I just mention this because more than once
I have seen aviaries so crammed with perches of every description
as to make them far more suitable as quarters for some climbing
animal rather than for a bird. Natural perches are, of course, best,
the most suitable, perhaps, being hazel, as straight lengths can
be cut for each end of the aviary while the twiggy branches
may be nailed on to the back for the birds 5 amusement.
One of the bugbears of Parrakeet keeping is feather plucking,
and I am convinced that this vice is more often started as an
antidote to boredom than from any other cause. Now boredom
doubtless chiefly assails caged birds, but even so those kept in
aviaries should be provided with as many healthy diversions as
possible, and one of the chief and best of these is a twiggy branch,
preferably with the leaves on, of some non-poisonous tree such as
hazel, oak, ash, lime, or any of the fruit trees. How often a fresh
bough can be provided for the birds depends, of course, on how
busy one is, but in any case the oftener they can be given this
treat the better. Immediately a fresh branch has been put in
the birds will be found dangling from it at every angle, busily

nibbling off the buds and whittling away at the bark, and a very
pretty sight they make as they do so.
Generally speaking, most Parrakeets need the following diet.
Seeds : canary, millet, hemp, sunflower, and monkeynuts ;
members of the Broadtail family feeding chiefly on hemp and
sunflower and monkey-nuts while members of the Psephoti such
as Redrumps, Manycolours, etc., will eat a good deal of canary
and millet. Grass Parrakeets need the same seed mixture as
Budgerigars. Curiously enough, all the Broadtails are fond of
monkeynuts, with the sole exception of the smallest, the Stanley,
and I have never been able to induce any of our numerous pairs
to eat these.
A perpetual supply of cuttlefish should be maintained,
and it is also a good plan to give mineral salts in some
form or other, the most convenient probably being the iodine
nibbles that are sold commercially. Specially large ones are
made for Parrakeets.
Apples are an important article of diet, and it is a mistake to
suppose that just any old apple will do for the birds, as they are
often extremely fastidious as to the quality of the fruit they will
consent to eat ; and after all, particularly if you have a rare
and costly pair of birds which are going to produce readily saleable
broods, it is hardly reasonable to begrudge them a supply of
really good eating apples.
Parrakeets may be supplied with any of the ordinarily
recommended greenfoods, such as groundsel, chickweed, etc.,
and spinach beet may be grown in the garden for them. They
are very fond of grass, and a turf should be provided at
regular intervals for caged specimens, or those whose aviaries
are bare of herbage. Most Parrakeets, particularly the Grass
Parrakeets and Psephoti , are very fond of some of the flowering
grasses, such as rye grass, which is one of the best, and one should
take advantage of the supply of this during the few summer months
that it is obtainable.
Incidentally, all Parrakeets will be observed to eat a much
greater quantity of green food as the breeding season approaches
in the spring than they did during the autumn and winter.
One of the most valuable of winter green foods, particularly
for the Grass Parrakeets, is the little " poa annua " grass, which

<bodyText confidence="0.998367820512821" page_id="56323054"  page_num="384" year="" vol="">
grows as a solitary weed in gardens, and seems to bear flowering
heads most of the year.
As to heating, this, fortunately, is quite unnecessary for the
vast majority of Parrakeets, even the Hooded, which hails from
tropical Northern Australia, being, in my experience, quite
indifferent to cold and able to winter out successfully in any
reasonably constructed aviary.
At one time, not so long ago, members of the Grass Parrakeet
family were generally considered only half hardy, but I have
made extensive experiments with this family, and have now
proved that Bourke's, Bluewings, Elegants, Splendids, and Rock
Grass Parrakeets are all perfectly hardy, at any rate if they are
provided with a double wooded shelter into which they are shut
each evening and an aviary in as protected a situation as possible.
I should just like to stress here that I do not share the belief
of some aviculturists that it is important to let out birds that have
been shut in over night in winter, as early as possible. For one
thing, if the aviary is properly constructed, they should be perfectly
happy in the shelter, and I am convinced that chills are usually
contracted in the cold and perhaps fog of the early hours of a
winter's morning. Personally, I would advise that all stock from
the end of September until the spring should be shut into the
shelter at dusk, and not let out again until between 9.30 and 10
the following morning, when the day has had time, if it is going
to do so at all, to warm up a bit.
The only Grass Parrakeet I have failed to winter out with
success is the Turquoisine, but although these have been bred
at Keston on several occasions, they do not really flourish here
for some reason, usually dying off after a year or two, so I do not
consider this part of the world any real test of their hardiness, as
I know of other Turquoisines in different localities whose owners
find no difficulty in wintering them in an unheated aviary.
Most Parrakeets are great bathers, and a fairly large enamel
pie-dish provides a good bath for them. These are more to be
recommended than earthenware vessels since they are much easier
to keep clean.
Some people seem to experience very bad luck with their
Grass Parrakeets in the unfortunate losses they sustain owing to
their birds cracking their skulls against the wire of the aviary.

At one time it was considered essential--and we adopted the
principle ourselves--to line the whole of a Grass Parrakeet's
aviary flight with string netting, stretched taut, about 6 inches
from the wire itself. As, however, it is a most tiresome business
to keep string netting perpetually taut, and as we found it
discouraged so many potential keepers of Grass Parrakeets, I
decided to take my courage in both hands and tried first of all
some Bourke's in an aviary without this inner lining of string
netting. Since then I have dispensed with this precaution for all
our Grass Parrakeets, and have so far had no cracked skulls as a
result.
From various letters I have read, however, I have quite come
to the conclusion that there is a very real need for a string netting
lining if Grass Parrakeets are kept in unnecessarily large, all-wire,
aviaries in a particularly exposed situation, since under such
circumstances they are, if suddenly frightened, apt to dash up,
forgetting that there is anything between them and the sky above,
usually with fatal results to themselves. If, on the other hand,
their aviary is no larger than that I have recommended for Broad-
tails, they are far less apt to lose their bearings and when alarmed
usually fly straight into the shelter.
Suitable nest boxes for Parrakeets are of various types, but
personally I have found one of the best of all to consist of an oblong
box with a hole towards the upper end and half a coconut husk
fixed in the bottom of it, this being most easily done with clay or
plaster of Paris. All the Broadtails I have tried rear excellent
young ones in such boxes, and this season I tried the experiment of
giving a pair of Redrumps three Princess of Wales's eggs in a box
of this type, the result being the rearing of three of the finest young
Princess of Wales I have ever seen.
Another nest box is the well-known grandfather clock type,
filled to within 18 inches or so of the entrance hole with peat moss,
having a 6 in. layer of decayed wood on top of the peat moss.
Such a box is perhaps most suitable for some of the larger Parrakeets,
such as Kings, Crimsonwings, Ringnecks, Rock Peplars, etc.
Then again there are natural logs, which have many advantages,
their chief disadvantage being that ones of suitable size and shape
are so difficult to get hold of.
Bourke's, although they will breed in husk boxes, are particularly

<bodyText confidence="0.999477897435897" page_id="56323056"  page_num="386" year="" vol="">
fond of logs, and I am inclined to think these make the best nest
box of all for Manycolour Parrakeets, who are apt to let their
young ones die unless the nest box provided is entirely suitable,
and even then are a somewhat tricky proposition to rear successfully.
The beautiful little Hooded Parrakeet, which nests in a wild
state in burrows in termite ant heaps, was at one time considered
impossible to breed unless it was given as realistic an imitation
as possible of one of these ant heaps, which meant erecting a vast
sort of pyramid of turfs, superimposed one on the other, with
a hole burrowed in the side for the birds to nest in. This being an
extremely tiresome business, I decided to try Hooded with the
ordinary husk nest, but this, I must confess, they entirely ignored.
Most hens, however, readily take to a natural log hung horizontally,
and this would doubtless apply to the beautiful, but apparently
almost extinct, Paradise Parrakeet as well.
Grandfather clock boxes, being very stoutly constructed, can
be placed in the open run with no overhead protection ; but it
is as well to hang logs and husk boxes under slight overhead
cover.
It should be remembered that, generally speaking, Parrakeets
do not like the entrance hole of their nest box to face so that
the sun can shine full into it during the hottest part of a
summer's day.
Of the Grass Parrakeets, Bluewings and Elegants do excellently
in husk boxes, but for some reason I am inclined to think that
Splendids and probably Turquoisines are usually more successful
in a miniature box of the grandfather clock type.
Incidentally, with regard to heated aviaries, which I have
mentioned earlier, it might be as well to point out here that it
is quite erroneous to assume that because a bird comes from the
tropics it is necessarily delicate and needs a heated aviary, and
vice versa. Indeed, some birds which come from very hot parts
are able to stand even the coldest weather without heat, whereas
others, such as the little Yellow-fronted New Zealand Parrakeet,
which inhabits islands off the mainland whose climate is apparently
sometimes almost as unpleasant as our own, is apt to get a chill
the moment the weather starts to turn cold in the autumn. Nor
did I find that these rare little Parrakeets really flourish, even
if given a heated shelter. Indeed, the best winter quarters for

<bodyText confidence="0.999345466666667" page_id="56323057"  page_num="387" year="" vol="">
them consist of a large flight cage in a heated birdroom. I have
bred them in large numbers,, but found it, for some unexplained
reason, impossible to keep them alive for more than a year or two.
In conclusion, it would perhaps be as well to say a few words
as to the possibility or otherwise of keeping mixtures of Parrakeets
together. Personally, I shall always consider that for the best
breeding results, it is essential to give each pair of birds an aviary
to themselves, but I know of at least one aviculturist who has a
spacious enclosure in which he successfully manages to breed
Ringnecks, Rock Peplars, and Bluewing-winged Grass Parrakeets.
Generally speaking, the old rule applies as to relationship,
namely the less closely related the various species in an aviary
are, the more likely they will be to live and even breed peacefully
together. Some Lovebirds, such as Nyassas and Blackcheeks, can
be successfully bred on the community system, but others,
particularly Peachfaces, must always have a separate aviary to
each pair. This, too, of course, is absolutely essential for members
of the Broadtail family, as a cock Broadtail in perfect health and
breeding condition is a very cantankerous gentleman indeed.
This applies almost equally to the Psephoti.
For anyone who wants to keep Parrakeets merely for show,
it is possible to house a number of cocks of various species in the
same aviary, as long as no hens are in sight to provoke quarrels
among these enforced bachelors. One important point to remember
is that whereas two male Broadtails confined together in an aviary
might, and probably would, fight to the death, a larger number of
them similarly confined would be a much safer proposition, as
then no one bird is able to vent its concentrated malice on another,
since their quarrel would promptly be broken up by a third, so
that in this way there is undoubtedly safety in numbers.

CONURE (.Eupsittula guarouba (Gmelin)), IN CAPTIVITY
By W. C. Osman Hill, M.D., Colombo, Ceylon
In December, 1936, I had the extreme good fortune to acquire,
through the kind offices of Mr. John Hagenbeck of Colombo, what
has since proved to be a true pair of that rare and exquisite Parrot,
the Queen of Bavaria's or Golden Conure (.Eupsittula guarouba).
The birds, though having spent several months journeying the seven
seas in a small box, arrived in almost perfect plumage and appeared
to be in the best of health. They were quite typical in form, size,
and coloration, but the one which I took to be the female had a
few greenish and green-tipped feathers on the mantle, so that I
took it that this was a young bird. These green feathers were
soon lost, and apart from their behaviour I was quite unable to
distinguish the sexes either by colour, head-form, shape of bill,
or any other physical feature.
The birds were kept together for the first six months in a good
sized ordinary wire Parrot cage. They proved very affectionate
with one another and quite tame with human beings ; whilst the
female was frequently heard to mutter a few words in an unknown
tongue.
Meantime a large aviary was under construction, with a flight
of 18 feet, a height of 9 feet, and a width of 6 feet. The hind-
most third was closed in at the top and sides with asbestos sheeting,

another 3 feet. Two nest boxes were fixed high in the roof in the
closed part of the aviary. These measured 18 in. X 12 in. x 12 in.
each, and they had a hole in the front near the top.
After being let out into this aviary the birds remained very
affectionate to one another, and also retained their tameness so
much that they would walk right up to me if I went inside. Most
of the time, however, the cage was kept locked and the attendant
has never been allowed inside, feeding being done through a hatch
in the rear.
The birds have been fed on a mixture of canary and sunflower,
with a few monkey nuts, supplemented by various soft fruits, such
as papaw, mango, etc.

entry into this aviary, the two birds spent most of their time in
it, apparently only playing about. If they heard anyone outside
the cage they would struggle with one another to see who should
be first out of the hole, which only admitted one bird at a time.
It frequently took ten minutes or longer before one bird eventually
got out, and then the other followed, and both then clambered
over the wires to meet their visitors.
No serious nesting apparently took place till about December,
1938. The nest was lined by a few chips of wood bitten off the
inside of the nest-box. Babies were first suspected from the occur-
rence of a peculiar squawking noise on 21st March, 1939. With
the aid of a torch I saw at least one half-grown youngster covered
with dirty-white down crawling about in the bottom of the box.
The parents made no fuss whatever, but returned to the box
immediately after my examination.
One of the baby birds first peeped out of the nest hole on
the 24th April. Its head was greenish yellow and peculiarly streaked.
The bill was pure white. As I left Colombo for a holiday in England
on the following day, I write the remainder of the story from
notes received from Mr. F. E. Loos, an aviculturist of Colombo,
who has shown deep interest in the birds, and is keeping a careful
watch on them during my absence.
Apparently two youngsters eventually left the nest, one on
3rd May, and the other the following afternoon. Both babies had a
scraggy appearance about the neck, due to the presence of a lot
of pin-feathers. They were also streaked on the cheeks. In size
they are almost as large as their parents. In general colour the
youngsters resemble the parents, but the yellow is much paler,
with none of the amber tone. The richest yellow occurs on the
lower breast and abdomen. The forehead is yellow, but the cheeks
have a dirty-greenish streaked effect. Neck, throat, and mantle
are yellow, also streaked with green. The flight feathers are olive
green, as in the old birds, but the rectrices are yellow. The cere
appears to be naked and very swollen. The mandibles appear
to be similar to those of the adult in shape and colour. This descrip-
tion agrees with that given of the young of this species by Finsch
(\0x25A0 Papageien , i, 455, 1867).
The accompanying photograph shows the two youngsters with
their parents. The former are easily recognized by their streaky
plumage.

By J. Delacour
I never have specialized in Parrots at Villers-Bretonneux
or now at Cleres. I do not keep either a large collection of rare
Amazons, Cockatoos, Lories, and other Parrots and Parrakeets
such as one can see at the London Zoo, or in the aviaries of Mr. H.
Whitley or Dr. J. M. Derscheid, nor have I the wonderful colour
varieties of Indian Parrakeets and the rare species of Mr. Ezra
or the numerous breeding pairs of nearly all the Australians,
Broadtails, and Grass Parrakeets which Lord Tavistock, Mr. A.
Decoux and many others possess in Europe or in California.
The reasons are that the climate of Villers or Cleres is not
really suitable for the breeding of Australian Parrakeets, being
too damp, and also I always felt that the best accommodation
for Parrots and Parrakeets is indeed rather unattractive. The
dullness of strongly built aviaries (the movable ones being much
the best for breeding purposes, but far the worst to look at), and
the impossibility of growing any shrubs inside, on the one hand ;
the ugliness of strongly built Parrot cages, on the other, have
always prevented me from trying to keep a large series of these
birds. There is no doubt that if one wants to keep and breed
Parrots and Parrakeets under the best practical conditions, one
must put aside to a degree the idea of making them an ornament
to the garden, and be prepared to think only of the utility side of
the question. As, however, I could not possibly do without Parrots
and Parrakeets, some of the most beautiful, intelligent, and
interesting of all feathered creatures, I have to content myself
with a selection of four of the most attractive, from my own point
of view.
I have tried to keep them to the best advantage so far as the
artistic side is concerned, as well as their comfort, health, and
happiness. I always try to maintain a good many Macaws, which
are among the finest and most showy birds on earth, and with
them some of the larger Cockatoos.
These big Parrots look awful in aviaries, I think, and do badly
in them. None have ever bred to my knowledge in such
accommodation.
The solidarity of Macaws' aviaries and their untidiness, due

to the frightful work of the bird's beak on their perches etc., make
them an eyesore. Contrary to what many may believe, Macaws
and other large Parrots are perfectly happy and do exceedingly
well chained by one leg to a perch, though naturally, the ring
and chain must be perfect. After having tried many sorts of
supports, I have adopted a long fence made of concrete, imitating
rough wood in a perfect way, on which each bird is tied at intervals
of about three feet. The chain is long enough to allow the Macaw
to reach his neighbour, preen him and play with him, without
getting entangled. The top of the cement fence is hollow, and a
piece of wood is fastened into it, in such a way that the birds' feet
rest on wood and not on cold concrete. These pieces of wood do
get broken off and are replaced whenever necessary. Suitable
holes are made in the concrete and used as feeders and drinkers,
and the whole affair looks neat and nice. In the climate of
Normandy and of most parts of England, Macaws prove perfectly
hardy. Their roosting fence at Cleres is built&amp;apos; under very high
beech trees, where they can have some sun, but also a lot of shade
and shelter. They always remain out in the rain, which they
like and is very beneficial to their feathers, and they stay out of
doors practically all the year round. Only during spells of hard
frost and snow are they taken indoors, into an unheated room,
very often for the night only. For thirty years or more, we have
never lost one Macaw or Cockatoo through exposure to cold or wet.
There is now and then a specimen which cannot stand being
tied up. In such a case, the best thing to do is to give the bird its
liberty, either full-winged or with cut flight feathers. Nothing
of course is finer than Parrots flying at large and I always have a
few. But some individuals are impossible to keep in that way,
as they stupidly lose themselves. Others prove spiteful to other
birds and even to human beings, or too harmful to trees and
fruit. There is a certain amount of individual selection to be
made among the birds, and in any case, for one reason or another,
I have found it impossible to keep more than half a dozen flying
Macaws and Cockatoos at the same time.
Our chained Parrots are fed and watered twice a day, and
get many tit-bits between their regular meals.
At the present time, we have 4 Hyacinth, 7 Lear, 3 Green-
vvinged, 4 Red-and-Yellow, 5 Blue-and-Yellow, 1 Military and

as well as an old Bodtini Amazon. A beautiful free flying Great
Crested Black Cockatoo committed suicide last year, after a long
life of freedom, by sitting on an electric transformer on the other
side of the valley. All our Macaws are tame and gentle, and
some talk well.
There are a few Grey and Amazon Parrots in cages, as pets,
including Bodin's, Yellow-cheeked, Orange-winged, Red-fronted,
and a pair of the rare Cayman Amazon Parrots, which are put
out in an aviary during the summer and might, I hope, breed
one day. I brought them over from their native island on Lord
Moyne's yacht, Rosaura , two years ago. They are extremely
susceptible to cold and must be put in before the first frost.
I have now only a few pairs of Australian Parrakeets, a dozen
or so, of the most ornamental species, and also a few Cockatiels,
Lovebirds, and Lorikeets. They share some of the Pheasant
pens, living long and breeding now and then, although I must
admit that our results are poor compared to those of our members
who keep them in more suitable quarters, particularly movable
or concreted aviaries. To avoid the rather dreary sight of a long
row of unplanted aviaries, I devised the scheme of having
alternatively one planted compartment with Doves, and one
unplanted, with Parrakeets. The effect is quite pleasing. Of
course most of the Grass Parrakeets, and to a point the Polyteline
(Barrabands, Rockpeplars, and Queen Alexandra's), are harmless
to vegetation and can be kept in planted flights ; Hoodeds also
are not destructive.
My oldest Parrakeets are a lovely pair of Queen of Bavaria,
which Lord Tavistock sent some eighteen years ago to Madame
Lecallier who gave them to me in 1928. They live in the open,
and only last year, during the exceptional cold weather, were
they taken indoors. They have laid and hatched several times,
but unfortunately always in the autumn, and the young were
never reared, though two lived to be fully feathered on one
occasion. These magnificent golden-yellow Conures are very
intelligent and amusing, but terribly noisy. It is a pity that they
are so difficult to obtain. They inhabit Lower Amazonia, in the
Para district. When I was there in 1937, I could not obtain any,
and one old bird only was then to be seen at the local zoo.

A pair of Blue-fronted Amazons have successfully reared a
brood of five young ones here at Keston this season.
The parents had been in Lord Tavistock's possession, but he
finally decided to part with them, because although they produced
fertile eggs and actually hatched them, that is as far as their breeding
operations got, since they subsequently starved and finally murdered
their offspring. Lord Tavistock believed that the cock was the
murderer.
Now in spite of their sounding a pretty hopeless breeding pro-
position, I was anxious to give them at least one season's trial at
Keston, because a hen Parrot that will lay eggs and sit properly
and a cock that realizes the importance of fertile eggs--if a family
is to be raised--are two birds by no means to be despised !
If, furthermore, as in this case, they are a mated couple here is
an extra piece of good luck, since good breeding cocks of a seldom-
bred species usually seem to have the misfortune to be mated to
some idiotic hen, while a really good breeding hen of, say, the
Cockatoo family, is as likely as not mis-mated to a useless cock,
probably a " tame talking " specimen---who, when his wife
obviously wants to pair, merely asks her in his Punch and Judy
voice if she would like a cup of tea ! I know just such a bird !
The Amazons arrived here in September, 1938, and were housed
in one of the Parrakeet aviaries whose dimensions (15 ft. long
by 5 ft. wide by 7 ft. high) are similar to those in which we
breed our Broadtails. The aviary run was strengthened by the
f-in. mesh from which it was constructed, being covered with
larger mesh wire. Curiously enough, Amazons, although in
common with most Parrots they do a good deal of perch
whittling, are singularly undestructive to the actual woodwork
of the aviary ; an advantage which is certainly not shared
by the African Grey as an aviary bird.
In this aviary they passed the winter and were provided with a

nest-box at the end of the third week in March. This was of the
grandfather clock type, with the entrance hole protected with a
binding of zinc.
The hen, unlike most female Parrots, took to it at once, and there-
after was only very occasionally seen. We left them quite undis-
turbed and had no idea how many eggs they had, if any. Actually,
unless the cock had been shut in the shelter, this would have been
a difficult matter to investigate as he is an extremely ferocious bird,
and looks really alarming when he bristles his feathers and glares
at you with his brilliant orange eyes, muttering in a sinister fashion
the while.
Incidentally, when he is given an apple he will, if you are
standing close to the aviary, hurry down to it and tear it viciously
to pieces just to demonstrate what he would like to do to your
finger if you were unwise enough to put it within range of his
beak !
As a result the hen mighty for all we knew, have been merely
incubating what Lord Tavistock aptly describes as the " abstract
idea of eggs
Eventually, however, the cock was observed to be paying
frequent visits to the nest-box and disappearing inside it for quite
long periods. We therefore concluded that the young must have
hatched, and about this time I thought I heard the sound of a
young one being fed in the nest. The brood were, however,
singularly silent thereafter, and the sound may have been only an
over-optimistic delusion on my part.
Although--since I knew he was reputed to be prone to
infanticide--I felt it might be wiser to remove the cock to the next
aviary I did not do so, as it seemed to me that if previous broods
of young ones had been half-starved with the attentions of both
parents, matters would only be made worse by the removal of
one of them. At the same time I decided on a somewhat bold
experiment, in order to test a theory I had long held, namely that the
larger Parrots might fail to rear their young ones in confinement
owing to their becoming weary of the hard labour of perpetually
eating a sufficient quantity of small seeds to feed them with.
Lord Tavistock had given them bread-and-milk in addition
to their ordinary diet, and I decided to give them this too, supple-
mented by the catholic diet that pet Parrots in cages seem to enjoy

so much. A little Senegal I had for twenty-one years was passion-
ately fond of boiled white fish, and the menu I finally gave the
Amazons consisted of boiled cod, scrambled eggs, boiled potatoes,
and bread-and-milk. The potatoes, incidentally, were those left
over from the table, so that they had a certain amount of butter
on them. Of these, particularly scrambled egg and boiled potato,
they consumed enormous quantities and were supplied with as much
as they would eat of these various extras morning and evening,
and they also had to be given a double ration of sunflower, hemp,
and monkey-nuts. I should not, of course, have been so surprised
at the quantity they were eating if I had realized that they had
five young ones to feed, but even in my most sanguine moments
I did not allow myself to hope that they would produce a brood
of more than two or three at the most.
The Amazons proved to be extremely devoted parents, and
they certainly had to work pretty hard as the young ones spend
a very long time in the nest and the rearing of a single brood is a
full-time occupation for the parents during the whole of the summer.
Actually the eggs must have been laid about the end of the first
week in April, and the first young one left the nest on 20th July.
When at last we were able to catch both the parents feeding in
the shelter, we took the opportunity of looking in the nest-box and
I do not expect ever again in my avicultural career to have quite
the thrill I had to find the nest completely packed with young
Amazons, all obviously extremely healthy and flourishing.
Unlike a brood of Broadtail Parrakeets, which are usually
much about the same age, the Amazons were all of different ages
as in the case of Budgerigars, so much so that the two eldest were
large and feathering well when the youngest was still quite a tiny
nestling, the remaining two being at a roughly intermediate stage.
The young ones, when they left the nest, were extraordinarily
brightly coloured, so that actually at a distance it was difficult to
distinguish them from the hen ; but their most characteristic
feature was their very dark eyes which thus appeared considerably
larger than those of their parents. It is difficult to sex them,
although there is considerable variation in the areas of blue and
yellow on the head in each of the five young ones.
Four of the nestlings are, I think, quite the finest young birds
we have ever bred here and the fifth would have been equally

good had it not, owing to the large size of the brood, been forced
to grow up almost buried under the four elder members of the
family so that it must, as it were, only occasionally have been able
to get its head up to the surface for air ! In this way it got slightly
squashed and one of its legs is bowed outwards. Had the nest
been larger or the brood smaller, this bird would obviously have
been just as perfect as the others.
All five are excellent fliers, and I was surprised to find that they
flew immediately they left the nest, as I had imagined that, any
rate for a week or so, they would progress entirely by climbing
about the wire netting.
They learned to feed themselves with extraordinary rapidity
and two of them were seen at the food dish eating potato two days
after they left the nest.
At first, whenever one went to look at them they " froze 55
as a setter does, remaining so still that I can quite imagine they
would have been completely invisible against a background of
green leaves.
They are now just getting to the playful stage and are fond of
going back to and rummaging about in the nest-box. They are
also, I think, starting to join in their parents' morning and evening
chorus, which consists of the strange jumble of cries which most
Amazons utter at such times, supplemented, in the case of the
cock, by a most realistic imitation of a child being beaten by its
cruel parent.
The latter really is almost too realistic, particularly the gradual
crescendo of screams as the child sees its wicked father approaching
with the dreaded belt ! I have no idea where he picked this up,
but doubtless, like most of the Parrots that come into one's possession
since the Parrot ban, he has a fairly long and varied career behind
him, spent, apparently, in a variety of households.

When my father returned from India in 1923, he brought with
him a beautiful cock blue Alexandrine Parrakeet and a hen Lutino
Alexandrine.
The former was then unique, as it was the only known bird of
this species in which the green tinge had entirely disappeared.
After being acclimatized indoors for the first six months, the two
birds were turned out in a large open aviary, where the blue cock
lost no time in taking to his yellow wife. But, although they mated
and laid for the next two years, all the eggs were infertile.
We then paired the blue cock bird with a normal coloured
green hen, and in 1930, for the first time, they succeeded in rearing
four strong young ones, though unfortunately all were green.
In 1934 our object was at last achieved. The year before,
we had paired the blue cock bird with one of his green daughters,
and though they failed to produce any live chicks, we decided
to try this experiment once more. On the 14th and 15th April
two eggs were hatched out, and on the 5th May one Blue feather
was actually discovered on the second chick ! . . .
We were not absolutely certain, however, about this bird's
colour until a week later, when he was simply covered with sky-blue
feathers. It was certainly a triumph and the result of ten years
patient efforts.
The blue chick grew into a very handsome cock bird and became
even lovelier than Father.
We have now bred about half a dozen Blue Alexandrines, but
only two have been reared. This year the nest contained two
eggs, both of which hatched, one into a green and the other a
blue bird. Alexandrines are poor breeders compared with ring-
necked Parrakeets. They are unreliable parents and will often
give up feeding their young when they are only a few days old.
As we now possess a good many pairs of blue-bred birds, we
hope soon to establish this variety, of which the old blue cock bird
is the only one ever seen in India.
We also have Lutino Alexandrines and hope to be able to
establish these too, one day.

The breeding of fertile hybrid Parrakeets is usually an undesirable
pastime, but the infertile crosses between the various Polyteline
Parrakeets, Kings and Crimson-wings are a different matter, being
of exceptional beauty and intelligence and ideal birds for the show
bench or for an aviary where a display of gay plumage is the
first consideration.
Most of the crosses between the commoner species of the genera
just referred to have now been obtained, but there remained one
notable exception which promised great possibilities--Barraband X
Crimson-wing.
Having an odd cock Barraband this spring I obtained a hen
Crimson-wing for him, feeling pretty sure of successful results.
For a time they did not take much notice of one another, but
towards the middle of May they grew more friendly. It became
apparent, however, that the Crimson-wing was going to be one of
those foolish birds which will not look at any kind of nest and
insists on laying on the ground in the open flight, and in due course
an egg arrived in a fairly hopeless and exposed position. An
attempt to put some thick turf under the egg to protect it from
the wire netting on the floor of the flight merely caused the Crimson-
wing to desert and lay the rest of her clutch on the floor of the
aviary shelter. The eggs were taken by my aviary attendant and
put under a broody bantam which damaged most of them, including
one fertile one, but succeeded in hatching another. I had recently
lost a Crimson-wing chick through leaving it too long with the
hen foster-mother. Young Pheasants may be able to live twenty-four
hours and more after hatching on the egg-yolk in their bodies,
but young Parrakeets, it would appear, need feeding almost as soon
as they are dry. Accordingly I removed the little hybrid and
established it in a flannel nest in the bird hospital where the
temperature is about 85*. I intended to try and hand-rear the
fragile little morsel of white fluff, but although it got on fairly
well the first day, I did not like the look of it on the second as it
did not seem to be digesting the food in its crop as quickly as it

should and appeared uncomfortable. A foster-mother seemed
indicated, but the only one available appeared a doubtful pro-
position.
For many years I have had in my collection a fine hen Amboina
King, a large, gorgeously coloured bird as brilliant as any cock.
Her domestic career has been a stormy and unfortunate one.
I mated her to a cock of the smaller Salwatty race. Several years
ago they nested and produced one rickety offspring which, in spite
of good care by the Amboina, died soon after leaving the log.
The bereaved mother soon after fell upon her mate without warning
and scalped him badly.
A year later they were reintroduced and seemed pleased to
see each other, but the following day the Amboina again fell upon
the Salwatty without warning and repeated her Red Indian tactics.
After that they were separated for two or three years, and when
I introduced them for the last time I partly cut the Amboina's wing
and kept it sufficiently cut to enable the Salwatty to get away from
her if she turned nasty. The Salwatty was now master as, strange
to say, he had always appeared to be, except when his wife elected
to run amok without warning. He got his own back for the rest of
his life by bullying her mildly and cursing her in unmeasured terms,
but they never nested again, probably because the Amboina
resented the handicap I had placed upon her as a punishment
for her murderous outbursts. About two years ago the Salwatty
died and the Amboina remained alone for I did not care to risk
any weaker male bird with so fierce and untrustworthy a com-
panion. Last winter I obtained an exceptionally fine male Australian
King as a mate for a widowed hen occupying the aviary next the
Amboina's. He made a very good impression on the Australian
hen, but, what was more, I soon realized he had captivated the
Amboina as well ! At first he was not unresponsive and indulged
in a little mild flirtation through the wire, but later when his
proper wife began to contemplate domestic duties he realized that
such conduct was unworthy of a married man and merely cursed
the Amboina when she came near. As, however, is not unusual in
such cases, even alas ! in human society, his increasing coldness
merely fanned the passion of the despised lady who started sitting
about making lovelorn whinings and growlings which culminated
about a fortnight before the hatching of the young hybrid in

two eggs being laid on the floor of the aviary shelter. The eggs,
however, were not incubated and I thought that the hopeless
venture was over for the year when to my surprise two more eggs
appeared, the second arriving the same day that the young hybrid
was hatched. Although the risk of failure seemed great I drove the
Amboina into the flight, substituted the baby for one of the eggs
and watched from a distance. In a little while she returned to
her nest now reinforced with a thick layer of earth superimposed
on the sand on the metal floor-tray of the aviary shelter. Would
she kill the young one and come out again ? No, all seemed to
be peace and cautious inspection some hours later showed her
sitting steadily. Next morning she was still sitting and the following
day the baby was seen to have a full crop and to have grown
considerably. In fact whatever her shortcomings as a wife no one
could have discharged a mother's duties more admirably than did
the Amboina. Under the care of its large and devoted foster
parent the chick grew faster than I have ever seen a young Parrakeet
develop, and on 23rd July made its first appearance in the outside
flight, a strong flier, though, like all birds of its genus, a bit clumsy
in its first venture. In appearance it is much more Barraband than
Crimson-wing, having all the coloration of a young Barraband--
red thighs and pink under-surface to the tail--and no red in the
wing or blue on the rump. What will be its sex and what its future ?
Will it one day reveal glories now hidden ? Will it prove to be a
hen ? Will the Amboina, repenting of her good deeds, scalp it
when it dawns upon her that it is not as red as it should be ? Time
will show.
One interesting fact relating to the foster-mother's behaviour
is this. Though she disregarded the " breeding-sequence " theories
of the scientific ornithologists sufficiently to feed a young bird
before she had incubated, she decided not to let the poor gentlemen
down too badly, and brooded until her foster child actually flew,
i.e. longer than he needed the warmth of her body and as long
as she would have brooded if she had had to hatch her eggs.

We had been trying for eight years to breed Lutino Ring-necks,
when in 1934 we succeeded in rearing two.
There were already quite a number of yellow-bred green birds
here, and in a special mating aviary where young Parrakeets were
turned out before being sexed, there were two wild-caught Lutinos
and five green Lutino-bred birds, all of which were living happily
together. This was very unusual, for in most cases Lutinos and
greens will not agree together in colonies.
We did not know if any of the Parrakeets were cock-birds as
none of them yet showed signs of a collar. But one day in May
my father looked inside the nesting-box and was thrilled to discover
two yellow babies.
Young Lutinos can be identified almost as soon as they hatch
out, by their pink eyes.
Both these birds were reared with success, and after the moulting
season in August, three of the seven birds which had been turned
out together assumed male plumage.
Adult Lutinos are extremely pugnacious and will even attack
human beings. In the last two years we have bred ten of them,
most of which, so far as we can judge at present, are hen birds.
They are all living together in one large aviary, and are a really
beautiful sight.
In the wild state in India, Lutinos are still quite rare and the
bird-catchers only secure one now and again. When my father
was in Bombay last winter he was offered one for #40, a ridiculous
price. Indians are very fond of these sports, especially the Princes,
who frequently pay large sums for them.
As we now have twenty perfect Lutinos besides a great number
of Lutino-bred birds, we may safely say that the yellow variety of
the Ring-necked Parrakeet is established.

Like many other American Parrots the Brotogerys Parrakeets
also have loud, piercing voices, of which they make frequent use.
In a room one cannot stand this screaming for long ; but even
in the aviary it is so unpleasantly noticeable, that out of considera-
tion for one's neighbours it is almost impossible to keep these birds.
This is no doubt one of the reasons why the breeding of Brotogerys
Parrakeets is only seldom successful. Another reason appears to
be that birds like Agapornis pullaria require special nesting arrange-
ments. For, according to an observation of G. A. Lloyd quoted by
Chubb in his Birds of British Guiana , I, 1916, p. 319, members of
the species Brotogerys lay their eggs in the deserted nests of Termites
(wood-ants). It is interesting to note that in the few accounts
existing of the breeding of Brotogerys Parrakeets, it is twice mentioned
that the birds gnawed a hole in the ceiling of the room. The first
mention is found in Gefiederte Welt , 1892, p. 78, and concerns

to Herr G. Graeff, which, however, did not breed, perhaps because
they were two males. The second concerns the first breeding of
the All-green Parrakeets (B. tirica) by Pastor Hintz (Gef. Welt ,
1883, p. 205). In the large hole between the boards of the ceiling
and the floor above, which the pair only left for feeding, there
were in 1882 2 young of the first brood and 4 of the second and
in 1883 again 2 young which remained a long time in the nest.
In 1883 the pair began to breed for a second time, but nothing is
known of the result.
According to E. Hopkinson (. Records of Birds bred in Captivity ,
p. 86) the first successful breeder in England of the All-green
Parrakeet was Lovell-Keays, who in 1914 bred 4 young. In
Gefiederte Welt there are three accounts of the breeding of this
species : in the volume for 1886, p. 306, G. Graeff writes that his
pair reared 2 young in an aviary, after they had laid several times
in the cage, twice each year. Von Prosch (1894, p. 214) got
7 young in two years, and a pair belonging to Charlotte Rieck
(1932, p. 229) reared, in a cage only 80 cm. long, 5 of a first brood
and 4 of a second. In all the pair had 5 broods each of 5 eggs.

then the male died. Two of the young also had begun to breed.
Some of the fledglings were pecked to death by the mother. The
eggs were laid every second day and brooded from about the third
egg ; the period of brooding lasted about 21 days and the
young flew in about 5-6 weeks, as can be reckoned from the
statements of Frau Rieck.
As N. Grasl reports in Vogel ferner Lander , 1931, p. 163, shortly
before the Great War two blue B. tirica were fledged in the
Schonbrunn Zoo, having been hatched by an ordinary Green
pair unobserved by the keeper behind an ornamental cork screen.
In the second brood the pair produced once again 2 blue and
2 green youngsters. Of the 4 blue ones, one was drowned and the
other devoured by rats ; the two remaining birds were sold to a
lady in Budapest who raised 7 blue young from them, which
unfortunately, with their parents, came to grief during the war.
A coloured illustration, taken from a skin of one, was published
in Vogel ferner Lander . Another blue All-green Parrakeet was
described and figured in the Revista do Museu Paulista (Tomo XII,
1920, p. 81). A blue Tovi-Parrakeet (B. jugularis jugularis) is
also known. It was shot in a flock of normal Tovi Parrakeets
and wrongly described as B. subcaerulea , that is as a new species.
O. Finsch [Die Papageien , II, 1868, p. 97 and PL 2) gives an account
and a figure of this bird. Lord Tavistock was once offered (as
already mentioned) a white Tui-Parrakeet (B. sit. thoma st. thorn a)
(" Parrots "... in Aviculture , p. 142).
With regard to the Tovi Parrakeet Frau Hedwig von Prosch
reports (Gef. Welt , 1879, P- IQ 6) that it was not she, as was wrongly
stated in Gefiederte Welt , 1874, p. 241, who had reared these birds,
but that the rearing had been done by Frau Veronica Greiner
in Vienna. In 1873 two and in 1874 three young were fledged,
these having hatched out after a brooding period of about twenty-
two days. They were ready to fly in about five weeks. K. Russ
(Die Papageien , 1881, p. 186) and K. Neunzig (Fremdldndische
Stubenvbgel , 1921, p. 656) also make the same statements, Neunzig,
however, changes the name Greiner into Grimm. This explains
why Hopkinson quotes both names separately. In reality the
breeding of these birds has only once been successfully accomplished
and that was by Frau Greiner. Later Ed. Schmalz, as is further
reported by Frau v. Prosch, obtained another youngster, which,

however, was killed together with its mother by the father when
it was eight or ten days old. One pair that Frau v. Prosch
herself had for seven years, only laid ten to twelve unfertile eggs
each year. Further breeding records of the Tovi Parrakeet are
not known to me. On what the statement of Butler quoted by
Hopkinson : " not infrequently . . . bred by German aviculturists "
is founded, I cannot therefore say. Perhaps it is the result of an
error that has evidently been repeated by Tavistock when he says
on page 139 of his book : " The species has often bred in Germany."
According to Hopkinson it has never been bred in England.
Apart from the fact that according to Tavistock (p.141) a
female of the Tuipara Parrakeet (B. chrysopterus tuipara) in Mr.
Seth-Smith's collection laid 4 clear eggs, then the last species
successfully bred was the Orange-flanked Parrakeet (. B . pyrrhopterus ).
This was achieved for the first time at the beginning of this
century ; as is briefly stated by " Langjahrige Vogelliebhaber "
in Gefiederte Welt , 1902, p. 82, an acquaintance of his had fledglings
which were growing well. As u Langjahrige Vogelliebhaber " was
a Dane, this breeding was probably carried out in Denmark. The
first record of breeding in England is reported in 1925 (W. Lewis,
Avicultural Magazine, 1926, p. 71). Five young flew, which
were paler in appearance than the old birds and had no blue
caps. Finally in 1935 R. R. Hood (California) succeeded in
breeding these birds, as appears from a statement in VOiseau,
Vol. VI, 1936, and also in Vogel ferner Lander, 1936, p. 74. The
five eggs were laid on the 19th, 21st, 22nd, 24th, and 27th of June,
and on 20th July, three, and on 21st July, one, young were hatched,
of which two flew on 26th August, while the other two were
reared by hand. The rapidly independent youngsters were soon
neglected and persecuted by the old birds. Apparently a second
brood was intended. The young were quite naked at first. During
the breeding time the tame adult birds became very hostile towards
their keeper and attacked him violently whenever he entered the
aviary.
I myself have kept four Brotogerys , namely the Tui Parrakeet,
the Canary-winged Parrakeet, the Tovi Parrakeet, and the Orange-
flanked Parrakeet, but unfortunately not long enough to achieve
breeding successes. I was the more sorry that I was prematurely
obliged to give up keeping these birds on account of their

screaming, as they were very tame and amusing. Some were
already quite tame when I received them from the dealer, and
others were tamed in a short time. That Brotogerys Parrakeets
are easily tamed is well known and often stated, and single specimens
of these birds have proved themselves extremely pleasing and
affectionate pets, which could quite well distinguish their owner
from other people. If they are together with others, they are
naturally less affectionate towards their keeper, as their social
needs are satisfied by their kind. Both my Tuis, which I kept
for a year, became in time somewhat aggressive towards me ; if
opportunity offered to bite my finger or to drive away another
bird, both were always united. Otherwise they did not agree very
well, probably being two males. The larger of the two was very
tyrannical and treated his little companion in very unfriendly
fashion. Above all he would never allow the smaller bird to devour
a titbit before himself. And if both received a piece of apple at
the same time, the larger bird simply took away his piece from
the smaller, while he let his own drop. The Tuis when they
quarrelled not only pecked one another with their beaks, but also
attacked with their feet.
At night they, like all my other Brotogerys Parrakeets, always
slept in the nesting boxes ; they also often remained in them
during the day. That they had no intention of breeding was shown
by the fact that they made the box very dirty. Later the larger
Tui paired with a Canary-winged Parrakeet, although he only
took notice of her during the day. He only allowed her to sleep
in the box with him at night when the smaller Tui was taken
away. Both birds fed and stroked one another frequently, but it
did not come to breeding. An apparently genuine pair of Canary-
winged Parrakeets, which I placed for a whole summer in a very
large garden aviary in a village, also failed to breed. Certainly
they were often disturbed and handled inexpediently by their
keeper.
As one can see from the bare skin round the beak, the Brotogerys
Parrakeets are great fruit-eaters. Mine liked in addition raw
meat, fresh maize cobs, boiled and roasted potatoes, biscuit, cake
and that type of thing. They especially loved meal worms and
fresh ant eggs, but were not particularly fond of green-stuff. Of
cereals, they ate sunflower seeds, and if these were unobtainable,

canary seed and millet. When eating, the Tuis held the grains
exclusively in the left foot, as did also the Canary-wingeds ; only
one was right-footed. The feet of the Brotogerys Parrakeets are
turned in quite considerably. This, of course, does not denote
degeneration, as in the case of weak Budgerigars, but is an adapta-
tion for walking on branches. The birds preen themselves in front,
bathe often and thoroughly in a bowl of water and love sun-baths,
although they do not spread their feathers.
My Tuis weighed 49 g., 45 g., 43 g. and 43 g., the Canary-
wingeds 65 g., 64 g., 62 g., 56 g. and 55 g., and an Orange-flanked
Parrakeet 64 g.
With the deepest regret the Editor has to announce that Herr
Helmut Hampe, who was severely wounded in the Great War,
died suddenly at Braunschweig on 22nd August, 1939. By his
death aviculture has sustained a serious loss and his contributions
to the Avicultural Magazine will be greatly missed.

THE NORFOLK ISLAND PARRAKEET

about the Cyanorhamphus Parrakeets, and with the first instalment
there appeared a very excellent and accurate coloured plate of a
pair of Norfolk Island Parrakeets which was reproduced from
a painting of a pair of these birds then living in New Zealand. In
the articles I mentioned all the known species with the exception
of the Norfolk Island, the one with which I was the most familiar.
The articles were never completed, through illness and a protracted
residence abroad, and consequently did not include the chapter
about this very rare Parrakeet ; so I will now endeavour to make
good this deficiency.
For those not familiar with the Cyanorhamphus Parrakeets, and
I am afraid, unfortunately, that few are, I might mention that
they are entirely different from any other Parrakeets, not so much

from their outward appearance as from their anatomical structure
and general demeanour. They range in size from the tiny Alpine
Parrakeet (C. malherbei ), as large as a Budgerigar, to the subject of
this article, which is the size of a Pennant's Parrakeet.
The feet of the Cyanorhamphus Parrakeets are remarkable, they
seem more adapted for a terrestrial existence than for an arboreal
one, for they seem to resemble those of a gallinaceous bird except
that they are zygodactyle, that is to say they have two toes at the
front and two at the back. Yet I saw these birds on the ground
very seldom in the wild state, the only exception was when I saw
the Yellow-fronted Parrakeets feeding on the leaves of a small
weed on the ground on the Little Barrier Island. For the most
part they are birds of the heavy forest.
These Parrakeets are unique in the fact that they scratch in the
ground like a true gallinaceous bird, this habit is especially notice-
able in young birds which have just left the nest. In an aviary in
which I kept a pair of Yellow-fronted Parrakeets I noticed a lot
of small depressions in the earth into which one could put a golf ball.
I thought that mice must have got into the aviary and were starting
to make their burrows, but I was amazed one morning to find
the pair of birds busily engaged in scratching out more holes with
their feet, in the meantime sending up showers of earth behind
them.
The Norfolk Island Parrakeets have long slender legs and
delicate looking toes, and they skip with an agility unknown to
most of the Parrot tribe. Both these and the other Cyanorhamphus
Parrakeets which I have kept are able to run both up and down
wire netting with the greatest of ease, without using their beaks,
with quick jerky movements like those of a rat.
On Captain Cook's memorable voyage around the world he
discovered a small and very isolated island, a thousand miles or so
from New Zealand and over eight hundred from Eastern Australia,
and on the island he discovered two remarkable Parrots, one the
long-extinct Norfolk Island Nestor, a near relative of the Kea,
and the subject of this article, which was named in honour of its
discoverer.
It was my intention to visit Norfolk Island after staying in
New Zealand, so that I could see something of the wild life of
this bird. Unfortunately the company which ran a direct line

from Auckland to the island suspended the service just after I
arrived in New Zealand, owing to it being so poorly patronized,
so that to have got there would have meant going to Sydney and
getting a steamer from there, which is a long and expensive journey.
Some particulars of the island were given to me by a well known
airman who, through a breakdown with his machine, was forced
to spend a considerable time on the island. It is of comparatively
small size, only a few square miles in extent, and is now quite
thickly populated, there being over a thousand inhabitants. The
advent of such a large population has only been during these last
few years when, owing to the island being the nearest place to New
Zealand where bananas could be grown successfully, there had
been a great boom in land prices and a large influx of retired people
from Australia and New Zealand, who hoped to supplement their
incomes by banana growing besides being able to live in an almost
perfect climate. Now instead of resembling a typical South Sea
Island, it resembles a huge allotment garden where almost every
acre is under cultivation. From this it will be seen that there is
not much hope of the survival of this interesing Parrakeet. At the
present state, in another generation or so, the bird will exist only
as a few dried skins in museums like its interesting congenitor the
Norfolk Island Nestor, which was exterminated by the convicts
who inhabited the island in the early days of the last century,
and who were responsible for the disappearance of many unique
species of which we have little trace.
The following is a letter written to me by one of the inhabitants
of the island regarding this bird.
" Re the green Parrakeet you mention, it is not at present very
plentiful on this island, it is only found in the thick bush around
Mount Pitt. It is very destructive on nearly every kind of fruit.
It nests during October in hollow trees, especially in the stems of
dead tree ferns, never on the ground. This Parrakeet or one like
it was found on Lord Howe Island (this was C. subflavinscens, and is
now extinct), but has long since disappeared. It is still very
plentiful on Sunday Island (this is C. n. cyanurus which is quite
distinct from C. cooki ) in the Kermadecs where it usually lays from
7 to 11 eggs only about half of which are fertile."
I heard that an American expedition which visited the island
some years ago in search of this and other rare birds had slaughtered

every one seen* The person who informed me about the affair
said that after they had departed not a Parrakeet was seen for
years, and it was only during the last year or so that they had begun
to make their appearance again. Fortunately the birds are now
protected, and no further expedition it is hoped will be allowed
to commit such wholesale destruction. A few more expeditions like
this one would certainly sweep most of the small Pacific Islands
clear of their endemic avifauna.
Usually one only gets an odd rare Parrot or at the most a pair
at a time, but altogether I had thirteen of these Parrakeets, which
I think is perhaps more than anyone has possessed before or is
likely to possess again. I hoped at the time they came into my
possession to let those members of the Society who had permits to
import Parrots, have some of them at the cost of importation, to
try their hand at breeding them. In fact, I did let one member
have a pair and an old cock bird, but I got^nto serious trouble with
the Ministry of Health for doing so and they (the Ministry)
threatened to revoke my permit if I let any more birds go out of
my hands, though I had always been under the impression that
it was perfectly legal to dispose of birds to anyone who had a
licence.
Unfortunately there were ten cocks and only three females,
which left me with two hens and eight cocks, furthermore a mouse
got into the aviary one night, frightened the birds, and the next
morning I found both the hens dead with cracked skulls, thus ended
my dreams of breeding these birds. On my next visit to New
Zealand I was fortunately able to secure the only hen in the
country but, though apparently in perfect health, it died on the
voyage back to this country. I believe the only other known
females are two in America, or at least they were some few years ago.
As mentioned before, the Norfolk Island Parrakeet is about
the size of a Pennant's Parrakeet, and is of a bright grass green
colour, the front half of the head, a spot behind the eye, and two
large spots on the lower back are bright crimson. The red feathers
of the head are sleek and glossy, and look rather as if they had
been greased and brushed back. The flight feathers are bright blue,,
a round patch of closely set feathers on the back of the head are
pure white on the basal halves, and cannot be seen unless ruffled!
by the hand, all the Cyanorhamphus have this peculiar characteristic.

S. PORTER-THE NORFOLK ISLAND PARRAKEET
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99920946875" page_id="56323086"  page_num="410" year="" vol="">
The voice of this Parrakeet is singularly soft and pleasing, and is
like the distant bleating of goats. Sometimes they converse in
low undertones which reminds one of a person with a cleft palate
speaking very quietly. They also have a loud whistle which is
far from unpleasant.
They are remarkably intelligent, as indeed are all the members
of this genus, and when tame are extremely inquisitive. They
watch all one's actions with the greatest interest, and if one has
been working in their shelter, as soon as the communicating door
is opened they will go inside and examine anything that has been
done. Though not destructive to woodwork they gradually chew
up all plant life. Their diet is very simple, canary, millet, a little
hemp and sunflower, also plenty of green food and fruit such as
apple and pear.
Nearly all the species of this genus are liable to lutinism and
cyanism, and in the museums of New Zealand many beautiful
specimens can be seen. In the museum at Dunedin there is a
specimen of C. novea-zeelandia , which is a beautiful sky blue ; there
are also many specimens of a lovely golden yellow colour ; in the
Invergargill Museum is a lutinistic specimen with uniform brown
mottlings, whilst there are other species which have brown heads.
What beautiful strain we could evolve if we could get hold of
such specimens alive.
Pennant's Parrakeet is also found on Norfolk Island, where no
doubt it was introduced from Australia. As the immature plumage
of the Pennant somewhat resembles that of the adult Norfolk
Island Parrakeet, but has more red in it, the inhabitants of the
island believe that the two species interbreed.
This is quite erroneous, as the two species are so distantly
related that a union between them would doubtless be sterile.
The female resembles the male in plumage, but is much smaller
and has a very much smaller head.

Secretary of the O.P.S. in the Air.
Mr. Jerome Lambert, Secretary of the Ornamental Pheasant Society, a member
of the Auxiliary Air Force, has shown his prowess by spotting two mines in front
of a convoy. Warm congratulations are accorded to him and to his father,
Mr. P. J. Lambert. Members may remember that an Auxiliary Air Force officer
was mentioned on the wireless and in the Press for the above-mentioned deed.
Mr. P. J. Lambert writes : " We are not carrying on the O.P.S. during war
time, we are under suspension. Immediately the war is over we shall spring into
life, we hope with renewed vigour." A hope which is certainly endorsed and
carries the good wishes of all their fellow aviculturists. In the correspondence
columns of this number Mr. Lambert contributes a letter on the importance
of maintaining stocks of rare Pheasants, a matter which should receive immediate
and serious attention.

Though the Avicultural Society and the Ornamental Pheasant Society
have both had to abandon their Greeting cards owing to the war, two kindred
Societies have published bird cards which should be of interest to aviculturists.
A charming painting of the Hobby with young by G. E. Lodge, reproduced in
colour, is the subject of a card published by the Association of Bird Watchers and
Wardens. This may be had at 5^. a dozen inclusive of envelopes, or 5 d. each,
from N. Tracy, Esq., The Black Cabin, South Wootton, Kings Lynn, Norfolk.
All proceeds from the card assist funds of the Association which is doing good
work in preserving rare birds in Britain, particularly the birds of prey.
The British Trust for Ornithology publishes a reproduction in colour of the
Woodcock and young specially painted by Peter Scott which is most attractive
and which should certainly find a ready sale. The price is 45. 6rf. per dozen with
envelopes, post free, and the cards may be obtained from Mrs. J. B. Priestley,
Billingham Manor, Chillerton, Isle of Wight. A leaflet giving a black and white
reproduction of this card and all details of price was circulated with the
November number of the Avicultural Magazine.

BREEDING THE BLUE AND YELLOW MACAW IN EDINBURGH
ZOOLOGICAL PARK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998319166666667" page_id="56323087"  page_num="411" year="" vol="">
The breeding of any species of Macaw in captivity is an event worthy of
record and most of the cases hitherto reported have been of hybrids between
two species. I was therefore very interested to receive a letter from Mr. Lewis
Newstead, Keeper in the Zoological Park at Edinburgh, telling me of the hatching
and rearing of a couple of Blue and Yellow Macaws (Ara ararauna ). Mr. Newstead
writes under date 10th November, 1939 : " The first two eggs were laid in

June, but were infertile, but the next nest contained three eggs laid while I was
on holiday which I started on the 5th of August. I was away a fortnight and
when I got back I discovered the three eggs. One hatched on 22nd August,
the other on the 29th, the third being infertile.
" The birds are out in an open aviary with a mixed lot of Cockatoos and
Macaws. You have seen our place and will remember that there is no heating.
The nest is in an old tree-trunk and the young birds still keep out of sight but
are getting nicely feathered.
" I had a pair of Red and Blue Macaws for years which laid every year up
till the time they died a few years ago, but the eggs were always infertile."

A PLEA FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF A STOCK OF RARE
PHEASANTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983746111111111" page_id="56323088"  page_num="412" year="" vol="">
I am fully in accord with Mr. Moody's suggestions in last month's letter to
our Magazine. That rare waterfowl should be carefully nursed during the war
period is indeed most important. I must make a similar plea for rare Pheasants.
Pheasants that have their natural habitat in Malaya, many parts of India,
Burma, Indo-China, and other countries, are perhaps safe for all time, as vast
impenetrable forests and the nature of the country practically make the birds
immune from serious diminution in numbers. If we turn to China we find a
very different proposition ; all great travellers tell us that Pheasants are not
only on the decrease in that vast territory, but that many species are seriously
threatened with extinction. If the world's stock of many Pheasants that come
from China is not now carefully nursed, then it is certain that they will be lost
for all time in our aviaries. The O.P.S. has suspended operations and activities
for the duration of the war, but whilst one regrets this suspension, nevertheless
under existing circumstances I am certain it was necessary if the Society hopes
to renew activities with full vigour after peace is declared. Therefore I make
an appeal to all members of the Avicultural Society who now keep Pheasants
that come from China to preserve them at all cost, or if they are unable to do so
then I do trust such members will get in touch with me as I shall be able to find
them temporary shelter and food. There are in this country many hybrid
Golden and Amherst Pheasants, and these should be at once sacrificed " for the
pot ", but pure Pheasants of these species will I trust be kept and bred from.
Reeve's, Elliot's, the Crossoptilons must be mentioned in the same category. I am
given to understand that even the Reeve's Pheasant, at present so common in
our aviaries, is seriously threatened in its own home.
P. J. Lambert.

Nesting of Newly Shipped Geese
The Editor greatly regrets that an error was made in the letter under this
heading contributed by Mr. C. L. Sibley in the October number. The letter
should have read " A most unusual occurrence this year was the nesting of a pair
of Greater Snow Geese within a week or two of their receipt from us by Mr. Spedan
Lewis ", the two words in italics were in error transposed in the letter published
in the October number. Owing to the unsettled conditions at that time no proof
was sent to Mr. Sibley or this mistake would not have occurred.
