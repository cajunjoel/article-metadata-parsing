By W. R. Carthew (Vereeniging, S. Africa)
I have had for many years a number of cranes in my private
collection of birds and animals. The Crowned Cranes had never shown
any indication of wanting to reproduce until 1963 (after fourteen
years with me) when one pair decided to do something after so long.
They nested just outside a side gate 50 feet from the front door of my
house leading into a large open paddock. It appears that these birds
are very long lived and commence to breed late in life. It is usual for
these birds to nest in swamps by constructing a nest of swamp vegetation
piled together in a raised position above water level.
In this instance they went about their nesting in the very same way
only they had dry land conditions. They built their nest on the
ground using small twigs from a pile of last year's prunings, lining it
with still smaller ones. The nest was built on the west side of this pile
of prunings which afforded them much shelter. Incidentally they
selected and used the same* spot last year, but most unfortunately the
hen was attacked and rather badly injured by some unknown vermin
whilst incubating at night.
When this sad accident was noticed it was then too late to transfer
the already well advanced incubated eggs to other means of incubation.
However, the injured hen made a remarkable recovery and laid her
first egg about mid-November, 1964, followed by two more at longish
intervals. Later only two of these three eggs proved fertile while the
third was not and I assume this was the first laid. The normal clutch
is always two. The eggs are egg-shell blue in colour and measuring
3 1 '75 by 87-31 mm., rather sharp at pointed end.
Incubation started in earnest in early December, but owing to my
being away just at this time for a short while it was impossible to record
the exact date. Incubation was equally shared by the two birds. The
male doing the day shift and the hen the night. At change of shifts from
5 to 6 p.m. both birds indulged in an evening walk. These birds are
very spiteful during the breeding period and attack any and everything,

2 W. R. CARTHEW-BREEDING OF GREY-NECKED CROWNED CRANES
inflicting nasty wounds, should any living thing approach their territory,
which is theirs and theirs only, arid this I must mention amounts to
quite a large area.
The incubation was about twenty-eight days ; the two chicks hatched
at 4 p.m. New Year's Day, 1965, in terrific heat. During this operation
the hen bird stood up and watched every movement along with quite
a crowd of New Year's Day visitors all of whom were astonished at the
performance. All this lasted until sunset when the hen settled for the
night.
The chicks were rather small for such a large egg, were covered in
a reddish-brown fluff, had slate-coloured legs and bill, and faint
indication only of the crest. At this hatching unfortunately there was
no camera available. The chicks developed rather rapidly for the first
two weeks when unfortunately one was lost due to heat stroke, or being
injured by a hawk which was about catching other fowl chicks at the time.
The single chick is now almost fully grown, well feathered out,
with crest showing which is brown in colour.
The method of tending these chicks by the parents is exactly the
same as a domestic fowl with chicks, that is picking up food making a
faint noise and dropping it in front of the chick, still toying with it for
the chick's attention. The chicks of course are very fond of water apart
from loving to stand in it.
Incidently, all my birds of this nature are pinioned and have free
range and are only securely locked up every night.
I will be most happy to know if I am the first world breeder of this
species in captivity, for as far as my knowledge tells me I am the lucky
breeder. It has not happened here in South Africa but I do know of
Crowned Cranes raised in captivity from eggs collected in the wild
and hatched by ordinary domestic fowls.
Other recorded breedings in my collection this year are twenty
Egyptian Geese and three geese now incubating. These birds I am now
breeding to the fifth generation in my collection. Also many ornamental
pheasants, canaries, and parrakeets were raised. One Stanley Crane
alone laid twelve eggs just because she was an odd bird. Stanley Crane
normal clutch only two eggs. Pied Crows nested but eggs went astray,
either the parents ate them or the rats, which we are continually
destroying. This is a very sandy area and exceedingly difficult to
control rodents.
Additional note .--This pair of Crowned Cranes have now again nested
in the exact same place--have adopted territorial attitude and have
driven their year old chick frantic so have had to put it in a place of
safety far away from the parents. It is now a fine specimen.
The hen has laid three eggs as follows : 23rd, 25th, and
27th December, 1965.

Incubation started in earnest at midday of 28th. A point of interest is
whether all those eggs will hatch. I am inclined to say no for I am
now of strong opinion that the first egg laid, is, shall I say a dummy, or
an experiment, on the part of the hen bird.
I should mention that the local native name of these birds is Mahem
from which its call gives it its name, which is very pronounced at
evening, change of weather, or alarm.

I have for long seen the necessity of a regular supply of small live
food if one is ever able, as I had once hoped, to establish strains of the
small waxbills, in particular, in captivity or should I say domestication ?
Particularly I have wanted to breed the tiny but very beautiful
Avadavat. In India I found by chance that one could breed the
house-fly with great ease, merely by half-filling a big clay chatty or
water jar with bran, wetting the bran which in the great heat rapidly
decomposed, and the decomposing bran attracted numerous houseflies
which soon left large numbers of offspring or as some of my Indian
friends would say " issues 5 5 though this particular term was more
generally restricted and applied to the human species. " How many
issues has your Honour got ? 55 was usually the tender and solicitous
inquiry. But be this as it may, I had found in India the means of
providing myself with very large numbers of clean odourless little
maggots, in quantities of what appeared to be leaf mould, but which
was in fact decomposed bran. I found I could not reproduce these
conditions in this temperate English climate.
I read many and various solutions of this vexed problem in various
articles. " Get a sheep's head," it was written, " and hang it up and
maggots will fall like manna from Heaven, only there will be a strong,
strong smell; but the maggots will fall in myriads in the receptacle filled
with sawdust placed upon the ground to receive them." Somehow this
particular source of nutrition did not attract me. Then wrote another,
"Get chicken manure, bury it in the ground and water it, and in time
the ground will heave with this choice food." The ground never
heaved for me. " Bury a young chicken, a dead young chicken or a
duckling," wrote another. Young dead chickens or young dead ducklings
do not smell, at least, do not smell offensively, but the young chickens
or ducklings never heaved for me. An old friend from India did buy
and bury in our compost heap some expensive liver ; this he used to
do some fifty years ago for bait for angling, and behold it was successful.
The liver increased and multiplied. Matter we are told, is indestruc-
tible only it changes its form. This is a Hindu saying which contains

a profound truth but I did not want fat maggots for angling. I wanted
thin maggots for young waxbills and in a place more convenient of
immediate access than a compost heap.
Once I thought I had discovered the secret by accident, as Isaac
Newton found by accident the secret of gravity. Susie, my Yorkshire
terrier, though she did not know it, was a partner in this great discovery.
I revealed in a letter to our Magazine how this great joint discovery
was achieved but we could not repeat this great achievement.
Again it was by chance I discovered what I think is the infallible
way of producing this great form of necessary nutrition for young birds.
I have a pair of Greater Hill Mynahs. In India I would feed them
very satisfactorily on the great universal food among those who keep
Shamas, Magpie-Robins, and other attractive Indian softbills. This
is Sattoo which I have described already in this Magazine. One of the
ingredients is ox kidney which could be bought very cheaply in the
Indian bazaar but it is very expensive in the English bazaar : and so
I was constrained to use as a substitute minced meat. I did not find this
cheap. Two shillings a half-pound they charge me. But one day this
nutritious food arrived in its usual greaseproof paper but it was not as
securely packed as it should have been ; it was not absolutely isolated
from the outside world and when I came to use it, it smelled, not too
strongly ; not stronger than, for instance, many a camel driver I have
sat behind on my journeys through the Sind desert on tours of inspec-
tion in days long past. It was a strong smell, the surrounding air was
nifty ; it caused a certain movement in the nostrils but the meat was
also covered with the eggs of the bluebottle or perhaps the greenbottle,
I was not sufficiently fortunate to see the stocking up, if you catch my
meaning. This sight would have filled any housewife with horror, but
I was not a housewife. I was an aviculturist on the verge of a great
discovery. I placed this half-pound of best minced meat, or so I had
been assured, in its greaseproof paper in a shallow enamel pudding
dish, having carefully spread out the minced meat over the bottom of
the dish so as to keep the " issues 55 of these wonders of nature free
from harm. By chance under the greaseproof paper on which lay
this precious burden, was another piece of greaseproof paper and this
appeared a happy accident for after the maggots had hatched and fed
for a few days some of them, being seized with the spirit of adventure
which we are told our young people sadly lack, found their way through
a small hole in the first piece of greaseproof paper into the second piece
resting beneath. Masses of tiny clean maggots were there for the gather-
ing up with a spoon, a rich harvest indeed and still masses of tiny maggots
were gathered in the greaseproof paper which saw their infant birth.
I placed the adventurous young maggots in another pudding dish
filled with bran and in this they cleaned themselves and indeed
seemed to me to continue growing. This I thought, is another version

of the widow's cruse but their growth was slight and due, I suppose, to

SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE HARLEQUIN
QUAIL
(Coturnix delegorguei)

ByJ. Trollope (Hounslow, Middlesex, England)
This species was first bred by Mr. D. Seth-Smith in 1906, who wrote
a most interesting article on the Genus Corturnix, which appeared in the
Avicultural Magazine the following year.
C. delegorguei has a wide distribution in Africa, but is not often
imported. I purchased a pair on 1st July, 1965, which were in good
condition except for slight scalp injury. The left wing was clipped as a
precaution ; within a few days, however, they became remarkably
tame. The cock is very handsome with a black and white facial
" mask ", black chest edged with rufous, black abdomen, and rufous
flanks. Hens are not easily distinguishable from other females of the
genus, there is a faint black necklace marking, the breast is spotted
with brown, and the flanks show a slight rufous colouring.
An egg was laid on 8th August in a scrape lined with a few dead
weeds and the hen completed a clutch of nine, but did not sit. A second
clutch of eight eggs was commenced on 22nd August, again the hen
did not sit, probably because both sites were completely exposed.
After these efforts I did not think any further breeding attempt would
be made, but much to my surprise a third nest was found on 2nd
September, well concealed behind a clump of weed. This scrape con-
tained three eggs and a fourth was laid on the same day. A clutch of
seven was completed and she began to sit on the 5th September. An
interesting point concerning this clutch was that nine eggs were counted
on 21 st September, when the hen came off for a feed. Four chicks
hatched on 24th September, five eggs containing developed chicks
were left in the scrape. The hen and chicks were shut in the aviary
shelter the following day, the cock showed no sign of distress at the

separation. On the morning of the 27th only three chicks could be
found ; this was a mystery as there seemed no possible way of escape.
Mixed millets, maw, white worms, maggots, and chopped meal-
worms were given twice a day, also clumps of grass complete with
roots and soil. In the down stage the chicks were a yellowish buff,
heavily striped with dark brown, they could not get through inch
wire mesh. The eggs varied from light buff to olive brown, in most
cases very heavily marked with reddish brown, the average size of
nine eggs measured was 31 *4 by 23-2 mm. On 12th October the first
of five completely unmarked eggs was found in the shelter. During
this period the cock was continually calling with a loud " Whit-Whit
Wheet ", " Whit-Whit Wheet-Whit ", the hen answering with
" Quick-ic " "or Queet-ic ", they could not see each other and this was
the first vocal contact since separation.
At the time of writing (14th November) the three surviving chicks are
following the same development pattern since they became recognizable
as individuals, one very robust large cock, a smaller cock, and a hen
which has been retarded from the start. The chicks were scratching
for food at 13 days, dust bathing at 15 days, the hen was not seen
" brooding " them after 20 days but the weakling was constantly
trying to " clump " with her brothers and still does. The most notable
thing about the adult birds was the apparently limited pair-bond.
There was no physical contact apart from copulation, during dust
bathing (accidental ?), and a peculiar " attack " by the cock while the
hen was sitting. He would drive her from the nest with sharp blows of
the beak when I entered the aviary to feed them. After these attacks
she would run around the aviary in an agitated manner, occasionally
picking up seed, sometimes returning to resume incubation before I left.
Any suggested explanation for this behaviour, is confused by this
" attack " once happening when the birds were not aware of my
presence.
Prior to incubation they roosted in the same area of the aviary but
never together. Sometimes the cock would chase the hen with both
wings half raised in exactly the same manner as the Painted Quail cock
(Excalfactoria chinensis ). On one occasion the cock held an insect in his
beak, adopting a posture very similar to that of the Painted Quail
when calling his hen for the tit-bit. The head, however, was not tilted
sideways and if there was any call note, it must have been very low
pitched as I was a few feet away at the time. Should I succeed in
breeding these birds next year, the hen and chicks will be left with the
cock, as it will be interesting to see if he plays any part in the chick
rearing.

Introductory Note
It may seem a little impertinent to put these suggestions before a
society already well versed in the needs of birds, but it was considered
desirable that they should appear in a journal of recognized scientific
standing, in which they would be available for reference at future
periods, rather than be entrusted to a more ephemeral publication.
Introduction
A casual glance at many of the structures at present on sale as cages
for keeping birds in should suggest to anyone who cares for such things
that the time has come for a reappraisal of what we are attempting to
do when we produce such a cage. Birds differ from most other creatures
kept by man in that they are frequently kept on view in the home for
decorative purposes, but at the same time need to be confined in some
sort of cage. The cage then becomes a part of the furnishings of the
room, and this has affected the design of such cages, which tend to be
judged for their decorative rather than their functional value. Undue
emphasis has been laid on the appearance of the cage in relation to the
room that contains it, and too little on the needs of the birds. It is
significant that the type of cage sold to the general public for bird-
keeping is not used by those who hope to breed the birds that they keep,
and who therefore need to keep their stock in satisfactory physical
condition. In addition to the unsatisfactory nature of so many cages
there has been an increasing tendency to put on the market cages of
a purely decorative type, with odd shapes such as a vertical cylinder,
or a sphere with a single central perch, or a reproduction of some
fantastic oriental design. Some of these are obviously intended solely as
decorative objects, but it seems certain that someone will unwittingly
assume that since they are for sale they are therefore satisfactory for
the keeping of birds.
Summary of Minimum Standards for Cages
We have put the summary first so that those who are interested only
in the conclusions need read no further. In a subsequent section we
have given the reasons for the points quoted here.
The sizes given are regarded as minima. The larger the bird the
larger the cage must be, and the sizes given are based on the length of
the bird to be kept. A cage should be at least 6J lengths long, 4 lengths
high, and 3 lengths deep. This would work out for a Budgerigar at

52 by 32 by 24 inches ; for a Canary or Greenfinch 39 by 24 by 18
inches ; and for a small Waxbill 26 by 16 by 12 inches. This is to house
one pair only. The cage should have at least two higher perches ij
lengths from each end and 1 J lengths from the top, with an unobstruc-
ted space between them. There should be another perch at least 1 length
from the cage floor, and so placed that it is at an angle to the other two
but does not pass beneath them (see diagram). Food containers may
be placed in the space on either side of this perch free of the zones of
droppings from higher perches.
The back and most of the ends and top should be screened against
draught with some impervious material. Wood is traditionally used,
but transparent glass or plastic material would be equally appropriate.
As an alternative one end could be screened to include one perch.
Perches should vary in diameter.
These sizes are intended as minima, there is no reason why they
should not be larger, and no reason why one might not keep birds in
a cage shaped like a television set or a replica of the Taj Mahal provided
that this external ornamentation represents an addition to the basic
requirements given here. We have not considered here species having
special needs, such as terrestrial birds, and the standards are for typical
passerines likely to feed from the ground. In the case of insectivorous
and fruit-eating birds, whose droppings are likely to be moist and
copious, with a greater likelihood of soiling feet and plumage unless
the cage is constantly cleaned, the size of the floor space should be
considerably increased in relation to the size of the bird, preferably by
increasing the depth of the cage to give longer perches, since it is the
droppings space that is important.
Reasons for the Proposed Standards
Rather than debate the merits of the various types of cages available
it seems better to return to first principles and to try to decide just
what we are attempting to do when we make a cage. A bird is an
animal which is peculiar in that it moves mainly by means of flight.
If it is to be kept satisfactorily its cage must therefore be a structure
enclosing an air space which it is intended that the bird should fly
across. Since a bird will fly most readily from one perch to another,
the first and most basic need is for two perches which must be at
opposite ends of the air-space. In order to give the bird the greatest
opportunity for exercise in flight the perches should be as far apart as
possible. The space between them must be uncluttered so that the
bird can fly freely from one perch to another without its wing-feathers
encountering any other objects, and without the bird having to perform
any special evasive manoeuvre. In addition, there must be sufficient
space beyond each perch for the bird to turn without any part of the
plumage touching the sides or ends. There must also be sufficient

space above the perch for the bird to raise its wings without touching
the top.
The main difficulty here is to decide on the space between the
perches. This distance must be related to the length of the bird. We
can discuss this in terms of three typical sizes of the birds most likely to
be kept. For this purpose we may use the Budgerigar (8 inches),
Canary or Greenfinch (6 inches), and smaller Waxbills (4 inches). We
are of the opinion that the minimum length between the two perches
should be at least four times the total length of the bird. In addition
there should be at least one length of the bird above and below the
perch, and just over one length between the perch and the cage end,
and so the primary unit of space, consisting of the two perches and the
space around them would occupy 52 by 16 inches for a Budgerigar,
39 by 12 inches for a Canary or Greenfinch, and 26 by 8 inches for
a Waxbill. The usual practice is to place both such perches on a level
with one another, but there is no reason why there should not be a
Plan of cage to show arrangement of perches when viewed from above.
difference in level between the two provided that the angle that the
bird must fly at is not so great that the flight becomes abnormal. If the
levels do differ we would suggest that it should not be greater than
30 degrees above the horizontal.
While two perches represent an absolute minimum it is an advantage
to have at least one more perch at a different level, preferably a low
one since a nervous bird may be a little reluctant to drop down to a
strange cage-bottom in order to feed. If a third perch is added then it
is also advisable, in order to give greater variety of movement, that
the perch should be set at a different angle to the cage-ends from that
of the other perches. A perch running the length of the cage at right-
angles to the other two has the disadvantage that it is likely to be
fouled by droppings from the perches above. This is least troublesome

<bodyText confidence="0.998291733333333" page_id="56366233"  page_num="10" year="" vol="">
in cages where perches are expendable and frequently renewed, but
for general purposes it is preferable that the lower perch should not
pass beneath the others but be set diagonally across the cage at as
sharp an angle as the space between the other two perches will allow
(see diagram).
The addition of the low perch beneath the other two perches,
together with the fact that the bird on the lower perch should not
obstruct the space between the first two perches, while a feeding bird
should be able to pass beneath the lower one, will determine the total
height of the space required (although if the first two perches are set
at different levels the final mass might be a little lower at one end and
higher at the other).
The third dimension is one of depth from front to back, and this is
determined by the length of the perches. Since there is likelihood that
any cage may be used for a pair of birds rather than a single individual
the length of perch should be such that two birds in a slightly aggressive
mood should be able to use the same perch without one being in
immediate danger from the bill of the other. This means that the
depth of the cage should be at least three times the length of the bird.
This now gives us a minimum cage-space, based on the length of the
bird to be kept, of 6J times the length of the bird from end to end,
4 times the length of the bird in height, and 3 times the length of the
bird in depth. This brings the dimensions for the commoner species to
those quoted in the summary.
The feet of perching birds need exercise in grasping, and the several
perches should be of different diameters. Natural twigs which differ
along their length are useful in this respect, and twiggy branches may
be used provided that they do not obstruct the space and prevent free
movement. If possible it is better that twigs should be used and replaced
at frequent intervals ; and in such cases the cage should be provided
with some form of clip to accommodate perches of varying diameters.
In addition to the question of space and the siting of perches there
is another important point to consider, and that is the screening of
cages against draughts. Unless a cage is set close into a recess it is liable
to draught in any normal household. A bird which wishes to roost or
rest in the wilds will usually retire to thick cover of some sort which
may give complete protection against wind, even in very rough weather.
When a bird is confined to a cage it is necessary that it should be able
to find comparable shelter within the cage when it requires it. The
only way that this can be achieved is by screening part of the cage to
exclude draught. This screening need not be of solid wood but could
be of transparent material such as glass or plastic. Birds tend to roost
as high as they can, and so screening must extend to the top of the
cage. In order to give the necessary draught-proofing it would be
necessary to screen the back and most or all of the ends and top, or

alternatively to screen one end, including part of the front, back, and
top, so that at least one perch is completely screened.
Containers for food and water can be set inside the cage but must be
clear of the zones of droppings from perches. It should be remembered
that fouling will occur for about an inch on either side of the perch and
not necessarily immediately below it. In the case of insectivorous and
fruit-eating birds the droppings are likely to be moist and copious
and a larger area is fouled, so that there is greater likelihood of the plu-
mage and feet becoming soiled unless the cage is constantly cleaned. To
avoid this an easily replaced sheet of absorbent paper as a cage floor is
a great advantage. In addition cages intended for such birds should
have the greatest possible depth to allow longer perches and to prevent
too deep an accumulation of droppings.
On the floor we are in favour of sheets of paper or any reasonably
absorbent material which can be changed at frequent intervals for all
birds. The custom of scattering sand is not a good one. Grit intended
for seed-eating birds should in any case be given a container where it
can be kept clean, and sharp sand on the cage floor frequently leads
to foot ailments. Other substitutes are not difficult to find. The absor-
bent paper tissues widely sold at present can be useful ; while, if
economy is necessary and the cage floor not too obvious, even news-
paper can be used.

Final Comments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99984395" page_id="56366234"  page_num="11" year="" vol="">
We have confined ourselves to recommendation on the main points
affecting the design of cages for the birds most usually kept. To check
on the necessity for putting forward these views we independently
examined the typical cages on sale to the public. It was found that
none came up to the standards put forward here. In cages intended for
Budgerigars or Canaries the space between perches was usually as little
as 6 or 8 inches and rarely more than a foot, while even this space was
usually obstructed by a hanging perch. By the standards we suggest
most of these cages would be barely suitable for Waxbills. In cages in
the form of tall cylinders or tall slender square-section structures the
perches were above one another at sharp angles, often about 70 degrees
above the horizontal, and it was difficult to see how fouling of lower
perches and birds could be avoided. When the question of the sale of
such cages was discussed with stockists the universal complaint was that
suitable cages were not available and that it was necessary to sell the
styles offered by the manufacturers. The only ones that appeared to
begin to approach the necessary standards were some breeding cages
advertised in the cage-bird press and some do-it-yourself kits, although
even these were too small for the species for which they were intended
when judged by the criteria given here.

Construction
The house which is 20 by 10 feet was built by filling in the space
between the gable-end of my house and an outbuilding. The two new
end walls were built from reconstructed stone blocks. The entrance
door has one large glass panel, almost the full size of the door, glazed
with " Georgian " glass in which is moulded a small square mesh of
wire. This effectively stops the birds trying to fly through.
The sloping roof is covered with Trafford Tile profiled " Filon "
material translucent sheets. Under this and 8 feet above the floor is
a flat suspended ceiling of 2 by 2 feet square Filon sheets. This apart
from the door is the only source of natural light. It is adequate. In the
wall opposite to the door is a ventilating fan with an iris diaphragm
which completely closes the aperture when the fan is switched off.
Two dwarf walls 2 feet high were built to form a curving pathway
through the length of the house and at the entrance end this pathway
is expanded to the full width of the house to provide room for a seat.
The floor is paved. Land drains were laid beneath the crazy paving to
drain the beds behind the dwarf walls. These beds were filled with
a 3 inch layer of coarse gravel and a 1 ft. 9 in. layer of compost made
from a mixture of peat, sharp sand, and loam in the ratio 3:1:1.
In the right-hand corner farthest from the door, a pool was built in
the shape of a quadrant, the back of the quadrant being filled with
a waterfall built from natural gritstone rocks to nearly the height of
the ceiling.
Outside the entrance door is a safety porch 6 feet square built of
stone and with a wooden roof. The door to this porch has a similar glass
panel to the bird-house door. This safety porch serves to house all
switches, control valves, heaters, etc., and has a range of shelves for
equipment and accessories. Under the floor is a large water-tank into
which drains the overflow from the pond and the drainage from the
flower beds. It is topped up by rainwater from the roof of the bird house
and from part of the roof of the dwelling house.
Heating is by two \\ kW Humex fan heaters which blow hot air
through a S inch square mesh grid into the bird-house just above
floor level. Each heater is controlled by its own thermostat, one set
at 6o* F. and the other at 57 0 F. so that the second heater only comes
into use if the first breaks down or if the weather is so cold that one
heater is unable to maintain the temperature. Lighting is by four
" warm-glow 5 5 fluorescent tubes fitted above the door in fittings
specially designed for use in humid atmospheres.

An electric pump to draw water from the underground tank was
originally fitted in the safety porch. However, the noise was objection-
able and it was subsequently moved outside the building altogether
and covered with an insulated box to prevent freezing. The output
from this pump can be controlled by four valves. The first goes to
a hose connection by which the tank can be emptied for cleaning ;
the second feeds the waterfall ; the third controls four spray heads
projecting through the ceiling down one side of the house ; the fourth
controls four similar spray heads down the other side of the house.
These spray heads simulate tropical rain both for watering the plants
and maintaining the necessary humidity against the drying effect of
the hot air heating. They were split into two sections so that each half
of the house might be watered separately leaving the other half for the
birds to get out of the wet ; this in fact, has proved to be a quite
unnecessary refinement.
Planting
The beds have been planted with camellia, citrus, maidenhair
fern, Primula obconica, African violet, Lantana, bromeliads, Strelitzia,
Tradescantia, Rex begonia, Peperomia, Anthurium, Impatiens,
Maranta, arum lilies, and many other species. Coleus, scented-leaved
geraniums, and succulents have not been successful as the atmosphere is
too humid. Columnea and Bougainvillaea have failed, probably because
they need a higher temperature.
The walls were covered with 6 ft. by 3 ft. 6 in. panels of " Gro-mesh"
up which hosta, passion flower, lapageria, abutillon, etc., are being
trained. The waterfall is planted with the small leaved ivy, Hedera
saggitifolia and hearts-tongue ferns.
Birds
When planting had been completed, four small foreign finches were
moved in from an outside aviary until a few weeks experience had
been gained in controlling temperature, humidity, ventilation, etc.
Humming Birds were then added followed by Zosterops and sub-
sequently, to furnish the ground level, Chinese Painted Quail, White-
breasted Rails, Bengal Pitta, and Hooded Pitta. The finches have now
been moved out as they soiled the foliage with their droppings and
made too much work in sponging the leaves--a long and tedious job.
I find Humming Birds extraordinarily difficult to identify--dealers
names are not very reliable. I am not at all certain that the names
given below are correct. Even where I can find descriptions of the
species it is not too easy to reconcile these with the birds. It is standard
practise for Humming Birds to be described as seen when the light is
coming from behind the observer. Even so, as the colours are not due
to pigmentation, but to refraction, they change in an unbelievable
manner if the bird moves through thirty degrees or less to either side

or up and down. The general works on ornithology such as Birds of the
World by Oliver L. Austin describe and illustrate very few species. The
standard monograph Humming Birds by Greenewalt, although a
wonderful book, is not much use for identification, again because of
the comparatively few species illustrated. The best book I have been
able to find is The Birds of Colombia by Meyer de Schauensee, but only
135 of the 319 species of Humming Birds occur in Colombia.
The five birds I acquired from a London dealer were White-breasted
Emerald ( Amazilia franciae viridicens ), Rufous-tailed Humming Bird
(.Amazilia tzacatl ), Blue-crowned Fairey (Heliangelus) , Green-vented
White tip ( Urosticte benjamini), Chestnut-bellied Humming Bird
(.Amazilia castaneiventris). The Chestnut-bellied died after eight days,
but the other four are in first-class condition and at the time of writing
have been in my possession for twenty weeks. To replace the Chestnut-
breasted I have just bought a Blue-throated Amazilia (. Amazilia
amabilis) . This is a tiny bird and will already feed from a feeder held
in the hand.
Humming Birds are notoriously pugnacious and the London Zoo
find that in their Tropical House, which is very much larger than mine,
how ever many they introduce, the population seems to stabilize at
about six. In my case, the Heliangelus and Urosticte are sworn enemies.
These two birds are nearly alike except that one bird has a white dot
behind each eye and the other a white-eye stripe about  |inch long.
Although there never seems to be any physical contact, white eye-stripe
chases white dot until the latter is completely exhausted and can neither
fly nor perch and can, in fact, easily be picked up in the hand. However,
it recovers in a few minutes and seems none the worse. This bird is
exceptionally tame and always comes within an inch of ones face when
one enters the house and will always feed from a feeder held in the hand.
The Humming Birds are fed on a solution of Hasting's nectar paste
strengthened with an equal amount of honey. This is given in five
plastic feeders of the type obtainable from Birdland, Bourton-on-the-
Water, which are distributed about the house. Although these are
smaller than the more usual glass type, they are easier to fill and less
liable to get broken. It is astonishing how much of this solution these
five little birds drink. The five tubes are filled morning and evening
and although they are not quite emptied, they certainly would not last
through twenty-four hours. In addition, two tomato boxes, one on top
of the other and the top one partially covered, are kept full of rotten
fruit near the output of the heaters. These produce a plentiful supply
of fruit flies--Drosophila--which are taken on the wing.
In the winter months the lighting is switched on before dusk and
before dawn and switched off again at times which ensure that the
birds never have to go more than eleven hours without sufficient light
by which to feed.

The next birds to be introduced were a pair of Chinese Painted
Quail (Excalfactoria chinensis). The cock flew into the pond and died
an hour later. A new cock was procured. Nine weeks later the hen
flew into the pond and was drowned. A new pair was bought, but the
cock was drowned the same day so the hen was moved to another
aviary and I have given up the idea of keeping Painted Quail in the
Tropical House. It should be noted that after the first casualty, a
sloping stone was put in the pond which should have made it possible
for a bird to have walked out. But apparently not so.
To replace the quail I bought a pair of White-breasted Water Rail
(Amaurornis fuscus) . These have done well, they love to climb up and
down the almost vertical rocks of the waterfall and make an ideal
complement on the ground to the Humming Birds, although they come
from India of course, and not from South America.
The next problem was an infestation of aphis on the plants. I dare
not spray for fear of toxic effects on the birds. I remembered reading
in a very old number of the Chester News that they had had a similar
problem years ago (in the original tropical house before the present
one was built) which they had overcome by introducing Zosterops. So I
bought a pair of Zosterops. These are delightful birds and cleared the
aphis in no time. They also ate the centres out of scores of buds on
the morning glories. I never had a single morning glory bloom after the
Zosterops were introduced. They also ruined the buds of many other
flowers, even such large ones as arum lilies and did untold damage to
leaves including completely defoliating a young passion flower ; so
they had to be moved to an unplanted aviary. The aphis have not as
yet returned, but how shall I deal with them when they do ?
A Bengal Pitta (Pitta brachyura ) was bought as a juvenile. It is now
in full adult plumage and has become very tame. It does more damage
to the plants than I care for, pulling off leaves for sheer devilment
apparently, because it does not eat them. It is also rather bossy with
the rails. But it is such a beautiful and endearing bird that I put up
with it. So beautiful in fact that I bought a Hooded Pitta (Pitta
sordida ) but the first night it was here it drowned itself in the pond !
I am now wondering whether I should leave a light on all night to
simulate moonlight or whether perhaps I should move the orfe and
comets out of the pond and convert it into a shallow stream.
The rails and pitta are fed on soft-bill mixture and maggots and
seem to get a certain amount of natural food out of the compost. All
the birds delight in bathing in the waterfall and fly to it as soon as it is
switched on. All except the finches revel in the simulated rain and
never fly out of it to the dry side of the house.
A few more data may be of interest. The double roof and lack of
windows keeps the heat out as well as in. The inside temperature has
never been more than 75 0 F. even when the sun has taken near-by

greenhouses (with the shades down) to 90* F. The humidity seems to
keep about 80 to 85 per cent in summer when the heaters are not on
and 75 to 80 per cent when the heaters are on most of the day. Use
of the artificial rain puts the humidity up to 100 per cent but it quickly
falls again. My main worry now is that in the first twenty-six weeks
(to 5th December, 1965) I have consumed 4,500 units of electricity
and most of the year's cold weather is still to come ! I chose hot-air
heating because pipes and radiators are unsightly, must be screened
to prevent the birds perching on them, and are then difficult to clean.
Gas would be cheaper but we have not any. Oil would be cheaper still
but I could not get a small enough hot-air system fueled by oil.
However, this little tropical house fills a long-felt want and I have
spent many enjoyable hours in it when the weather made it impossible
to remain in outdoor aviaries and paddocks in any comfort.
I should be most grateful to hear from anyone who has any experience
of keeping, in such a small area, small reptiles or mammals which are
compatible with birds.
Finally, I should like to put on record my thanks for the valuable
advice I have had from G. S. Mottershead, Director Chester Zoo ;

SOME NOTES ON THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE
RED-BREASTED BLUE-BILL
(Spermophaga haematina )
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.97909025" page_id="56366239"  page_num="16" year="" vol="">
By C. J. O. Harrison (Perivale, Middlesex, England)
The Red-breasted Blue-bill [Spermophaga haematina) is a big, heavy-
billed waxbill that skulks in the swampy growths of West Africa.
Remarkably little seems to be known about it, and I have therefore
brought together these scanty observations made on a solitary male in
the London Zoo several years ago.
This is a large estrildine whose big heavy bill gives the head a rather
ungainly appearance. The male is glossy black in colour with a scarlet
breast, flanks, and rump. The bill is blue and the white eyelids show
as crescentic white patches above and below the eyes like grotesque
painted eyebrows on a clown. These are barely visible on dry museum
skins and are not shown in most illustrations. The female is a duller
black with a scarlet breast, and the belly grey, spotted with white.
The male was kept with a collection of small seed-eaters in the Small
Bird House at the London Zoo. In general it was a remarkably silent
bird. The normal contact call appeared to be a soft " tic " and I could

not elicit any special alarm call. (Bannerman, 1949, mentions a metallic
" swink, swink ", rather similar to the call of a Chaffinch, which might
be the alarm note of the species.)
In spite of its great bill the bird was able to deal with tiny heads of
seeding grass with great delicacy, and held them down with one foot on
the perch while feeding on them, an ability possessed by some other
waxbill species.
When offered stems of grass with seeding heads attached it appeared
to become stimulated to display. It was seen to seize a stem by its tip
in typical estrildine fashion and fly to a perch with it. Here it sang,
the song being a prolonged, rather rambling, utterance, and seemed to
consist of a confused series of " chipping " and " tcherring " notes, in
random rapid sequence, fairly low in tone and rather unmelodious.
When singing like this it perched very upright with its tail held to one
side in the typical " tail-twist " posture.
When it displayed it did so on a low perch, with the grass-stem held
by the tip in its bill. It leaned forwards with the bill and stem pointing
downwards at an angle, and the head-feathers fluffed up. In this
posture it performed a series of successive downward bowing move-
ments, slow and not very rhythmic. These were accompanied by a
rapid chittering song, sounding similar to that uttered at other times,
but rather faster and more vigorous. The song was accompanied by a
vigorous quivering of the tail in a vertical plane without very great up
and down amplitude. This quivering movement appeared to be the
result of the effort used in uttering the song. In the absence of a
mate this display appeared to be performed in vacuo or possibly in
response to some unidentified individual of some other species.
Later, after the display, the same type of song that had been heard
earlier was sung from the tip of a small water pipe projecting up a foot
or two from the aviary floor. The bird was also heard to sing from this
perch on some subsequent occasions. The song was interspersed
with the regular utterance of four loud, far-carrying notes with a
rising crescendo " dwee-dwee-dwee-dwee ". This might have been a
specialized call, but appeared here as part of the song and seemed to
have an advertisement or contact function, being heard at a much
greater distance than any other vocalization of this bird. This latter
phrase might be the " curious whistle " also referred to in Bannerman's
account.

By Kenton C. Lint (Curator) and James M. Dolan, jr., Ph.D.
(Assistant Curator), San Diego Zoological Gardens, California, U.S.A.
The genus Pipreola is one of thirty genera within the family Cotingidae,
a primitive passerine group confined to the New World tropics. Of this
genus, five species occur in Colombia, two of these, Pipreola jucunda and
Pipreola arcuata, are represented in the San Diego Zoological Gardens.
With the exception of the Cocks-of-the-Rock, Rupicola , and the Naked-
Throated Bellbird, Procnias nudicollis, Cotingas have been poorly
represented in both public and private collections in the United States.
It is quite probable that their habits in the wild state have resulted
in their poor representation in captivity. The vast majority of these
birds inhabit the uppermost tree tops or middle stories in great gallery
forests, which makes their capture a difficult procedure. Furthermore,
they are secretive and solitary by nature. Apparently these are the
major reasons why they are seldom offered in the bird trade, for they
are not difficult to maintain in captivity.
The Orange-breasted Cotinga, Pipreola jucunda , ranges throughout
the upper tropical zones from western Ecuador south along the Pacific
coast of Colombia. It is a bird of medium size, to 8 inches in length.
In the males, the head is glossy black ; upper breast and sides of neck
orange ; lower breast and remainder of underparts yellow ; back,
wings, tail, and sides of breast grass green. The sides of the body are
mixed yellow and green. Bill orange ; legs and feet greyish green.
The female is grass green, the breast streaked with yellow.
We received our first Orange-breasted Cotingas on 29th June, 1964.
At the time construction was under way on a new Hummingbird
aviary adapted for the reception of other compatible tropical forms.
Temporarily, the Cotingas were housed in one of the arched aviaries
forming the Benchley Plaza, where we found them to be very steady
and quite gentle with smaller birds. The Cotingas were placed in the
new aviary upon its completion on 28th September, 1964.
On 26th June, 1965, the two birds were noted to be particularly
interested in each other and subsequent matings were observed.
A daily ration of six to eight mealworms were fed to each. The male
would take a mealworm in his bill, advance to the female, and present
this to her as a form of courtship. He would then wait until she had
accepted and swallowed the food, then returning to the feeding
station for another morsel he would return to the hen, repeating the
performance until her appetite was satisfied. After the feeding she was
seen to fly to another perch and rest. Only then did the male feed

himself. It appears the female will accept food from the male only
after they have reached a particular stage in the sexual cycle. From
our observations the male and female come into breeding condition
simultaneously. Food passing is a form of courtship and an important
feature in the breeding behaviour of the family Cotingidae.
It was observed that the nesting site was chosen by the male, a
redwood hanging basket containing a large fuchsia in blossom. The
male would fly to this particular plant with a piece of grass or rootlet,
call softly and wait for the hen to investigate the particular site.
On 26th June as we observed this short courtship behaviour we
watched the hen bring in a piece of sphagnum moss to the selected
site. Merely using the basket as a foundation she built an open cup
nest of grasses, rootlets, and sphagnum moss in four days. The finished
nest measured 8 inches across the top, the interior measured 6 inches
wide and 4 inches deep. The actual construction of the nest was
carried out entirely by the female, although the male was observed
to bring additional material for use, much of which was rej'ected. The
fuchsia basket containing the nest was located at the west end of the
aviary, 8 feet above one of the ornamental foot bridges and ideal for
close observation.
The first egg, light tan in colour, with fine brown flecks was laid
30th June, with a second the following day. The hen did not leave the
nest during the laying period. The male guarded the nest and carried
food to the female so she would not be forced to leave the nest and eggs
unattended. The female proved to be a very stable individual incu-
bating the eggs closely. Incubation began with the laying of the first
egg and was carried out entirely by the female. We were somewhat
worried with the location of the nest as it was vulnerable to the other
miscellaneous birds living in the same aviary. Tanagers, sunbirds,
manikins, honey creepers, flower piercers all foraged from one end of
the aviary to the other with little interference to the Cotingas.
One egg hatched on 16th July, the second egg 17th July. The egg
shells were immediately removed from the nest by the female after
each hatching and dropped to the ground. An incubation period of
seventeen days was recorded for both Orange-breasted Cotinga chicks.
Live food in the form of mealworm pupae Tenebrio molitor was placed
in a small container at the edge of the nest for the parents to feed the
nestlings. Only mealworms were seen to be fed for the first five days.
On the sixth day a small container of fresh blueberries was offered to
the parents. We observed both male and female eating the blueberries
as well as the mealworms at this date.
On the seventh day one of the chicks disappeared from the nest and
was never found.
The remaining chick grew rapidly and as we wished to record the
age at which the eyes first open we carefully watched the growth

process. The eyes began opening on the eleventh day. At twelve days
of age they were completely open. Cotinga chicks are small replicas
of their parents, smaller in size, duller in coloration with bob tails.
Finally, at twenty-five days of age the young bird, being very strong
on the wing, vacated the nest, joining its parents in the central portion
of the aviary. Both parents fed the nestling wherever he wandered
throughout the aviary, following him from plant to plant. When
twenty-nine days old the chick was observed eating by itself.
The young Cotinga has proven to be a male and as far as can be
ascertained this is the first successful captive breeding of the species.

PARRAKEET (Conuropsis carolinensis ) IN CAPTIVITY
By A. A. Prestwich (Edenbridge, Kent, England)
Dr. J. F. Fulbeck (1965, 186) has described the probable extinction
of the Carolina Parrakeet or Conure. By all accounts it must have been
a very attractive bird and, one would have thought, a very desirable
inmate of the aviaries of the middle nineteenth to early twentieth
centuries. It does not, however, appear to have been fully appreciated,
for there are comparatively few records of successful breeding in
captivity. I have brought together such as I have been able to find.
They are given country by country in chronological order, and in
more or less narrative form. It was not thought necessary to give all the
references. Anyone sufficiently interested will be able to find them in
Records of Parrots Bred in Captivity , pt. iii, p. 79 ; pt. vii, p. 17.
France
Durand-Gonon, of Saint Brieue, and Verdin, of Troyes, were both
successful in 1877. These successes may have been the first anywhere.
No details are available concerning the events, but young ones were
offered for sale in 1878.
Germany
Dr. Karl Russ credits himself with being the first breeder, but he
gives no date for the event. He does, however, say that Dr. Nowotny
also bred it, in Vienna, in 1879, so presumably his success was in either
that year or just before. Neunzig writes : " A pair in Dr. Russ's bird-
room hatched out three young and later on five more. Three to five
eggs were laid, both parents sat and fed ; nest-down mouse-grey. The
young were the same size as the adults, but ... a lighter green, . . . not
till the second year was the yellow or orange of the head fully
developed."

Esfsfs were laid in the Frankfurt Zoo, i860, and two in the Hanover
Zoo, 1868.

The pair with which Dr. Nowotny was successful in 1879 was kept in
a cage, but allowed considerable freedom in a living room. The first
clutch of five eggs was broken : two of a second clutch were acciden-
tally destroyed but the female incubated three, all of which hatched.
One young one died after about three weeks, but the two survivors
feathered nicely. When they were some six weeks old, Dr. Nowotny
had to take them on a twenty-four hour journey--both died within a
week.

Despite various writers saying that there are a number of well-
authenticated records they are, in fact, few and far between.
The first " success " appears to have been in the Philadelphia
Zoological Garden when, on 9th September, 1885, a young one was
hatched from an egg which had been placed under a Turtle Dove. The
period of incubation was fourteen days. It is not stated how long the
young bird lived nor, indeed, whether the egg had been laid by captive
birds or taken from a nest in the wild.
Alfred Grover found these birds nesting in a hollow cypress on the
Tomoka River about 1892 ; he took their eggs, hatched them and had
about twenty young birds.
The Cincinnati Zoological Garden had a number of pairs over a
period of many years. Dr. William C. Herman has written : " The
parakeets were well adapted to being caged, some were in the zoo for
twenty or more years. A hollow tree was provided for the birds for
roosting. Here they hung for the night ; that is, they used their beaks
for holding on to the interior of the tree trunk and so rested for the night."
Dr. Herman has also written : " Some of these birds bred in captivity.
Dozens of young birds were raised, especially when others recently
captured were added." These events were prior to 1914, because the
very last Carolina Parrakeet died in the zoo during the September of
that year.
Robert Ridgway kept three Carolina Parrakeets in captivity for
several years, 1896-1903. They laid at least thirteen eggs : most of the
eggs in American collections are the product of these birds. In
November, 1902, Ridgway wrote to J. L. Childs : " My female
Parakeet laid only six eggs the past summer and I shall never get any
more, as the bird is now dead. The first she laid is the one I sent you.
The remaining five hatched, but I have only two young ones left, a rat
having carried off one, another was starved by the parents when half
grown, and the third I gave to a friend who had time and disposition
to take care of it in order to save it from starving."

W. D. CUMMINGS--FOREIGN DOVES IN CAPTIVITY
Great Britain
Whether they were ever bred is perhaps a little doubtful. Gedney,
writing in about 1876, and straining his rather elastic imagination to
the utmost, says : " with judicious management these birds will breed
freely in confinement. ... It is only now and then that a pair of
imported birds of this variety can be induced to breed, . . . but a little
perseverance will eventually ensure success, and I have often succeeded
by changing the male bird, after prolonged expectation and repeated
disappointments, . . . they are, moreover, profitable birds, as a good
pair will amply repay their keep by the prolific reproduction of their
species." Later writers have stated that they " will breed freely in a
large aviary or bird-room ", " not infrequently bred ", etc., but
details are invariably lacking, and the observations may not, of course,
refer to Great Britain.

By W. D. Cummings (Keston, Kent, England )
I was very interested to read the article by Professor Carl Naether,
in the September number, 1965, of the Avicultural Magazine, on
the use of foster parents to raise Foreign Doves.
I have been trying for four years here, at the Keston Foreign Bird
Farm, to raise Rock Pigeons X Stock Dove hybrids and, although I have
had a high percentage of fertile eggs--nearly 90 per cent--and the
squabs hatched when placed under domestic pigeons flying at liberty,
and also by the hybridizing parents themselves, we have not managed
to rear them usually beyond the seven-day period during which the
squabs are fed on the pigeons' milk. When the parents, or foster
parents, commenced feeding the squabs on hard seed, the youngsters
always succumbed. Only once were they reared to fledgling stage then
the squabs died.
We tried feeding the hybridizing parents on soaked wheat pellets and
knibbled maize, also bread and milk daily, with the same results.
We thought the pigeons flying at liberty would find a certain amount
of vegetable matter and wild seeds which, with a proportion of hard
seed, the squabs could assimilate, but this was not the case. In all we
must have lost over twenty squabs. We have tried keeping a pair of
domestic pigeons under restriction and feeding them entirely on poultry
growers pellets but the birds concerned never even attempted to nest.
Finally, we tried one egg under a pair of White-breasted Barbary
Doves and left them one of their own clear eggs. The egg was almost
three times the size of their own but they sat on it conscientiously.
I changed their diet from a mainly white millet diet, to mixed poultry
chick crumbs, a little hemp and knibbled maize, with a small proportion

of white millet. In addition, they were given a little insectivorous
mixture daily which they were fond of, and gentles, which we give to
all our doves daily when they have young. This did the trick. They
reared the young hybrid until it grew almost double the size of the
foster parents ! The hybrid had a thin, narrow bill so the foster parents
experienced little discomfort, which could have been the case if they
had reared a normal domestic pigeon, with its rather wider, larger bill.
There was a reason for this exercise for, according to my information,
the resultant Rock Pigeon X Stock hybrid is fertile, if a cock, when
paired back to domestic pigeons, so I will incorporate it in my domestic
stock.
We include poultry chick crumb or pellets in the diet of all our
foreign doves and pigeons, including the Australian Crested Pigeons,
Common Bronze-wing Pigeons, Tambourine Doves, and Triangular
Spotted Pigeons, and apart from the various varieties of the Barbary
and Ring Doves. There is no doubt that they are more easily assimilated
by squabs in the nest, as opposed to an entirely seed diet.
Apart from this, we have tried fostering squabs of the beautiful
little East African Tambourine Doves under Barbarys, but this was
not a success. The Tambourine egg is small, elongated, and a creamy
yellow colour, unlike the normal white of most other Doves. Their
squab is very small and has an almost needle-like bill, long and
very thin.
We have also tried common Bronze-wing eggs under Crested
Pigeons, which the latter duly hatched but would not rear and when
I was much younger I tried rearing Crested Pigeons under domestic
White Fan tails residing in a pigeon cote. The eggs had been deserted
and this was the main reason.
The Fantails hatched and reared the two young Crested Pigeons
until fledgling stage when they took off for the nearest tree and were
never seen again either by me or by the Fantails.
Since writing this article, the cock Stock Dove hybrid, paired to a
small Rock Pigeon X Lavender Ice hen, at nine months old, has gone
to nest.
The hybrid which, at first glance, looks like a Blue Rock Pigeon, has
a noticeably different courtship display. He bows like other members
of the Dove family and makes a continuous cooing note, at the end of
which he raises his tail, also very dovelike. He has full black bars on his
wings and although he has more colour around the neck than a cock
Stock Dove, it also does not join together under the throat.
He has been very good at sharing incubation with the hen and both
eggs have since proved fertile ; one chick was dead in the shell and the
other is approximately 9-10 days old. This seems to be a high degree
of fertility in a hybrid.

[Laterallus leucopyrrhus )
By Peter J. Levi (Southend-on-Sea, Essex, England)
This article has been written as the result of observations on four of
these birds in a large aviary in the Bird House at the London Zoo. The
aviary is very picturesque, containing two large ponds surrounded by
much peat and a large expanse of concrete, the former being adorned
with two large trees and also many rocks among which the birds delight
in playing a game of chase. Other occupants of the aviary include
tanagers, bulbuls, starlings, birds of paradise, touracos, plovers, and
also several other species of rails, etc.
There have been nine of these birds in the Zoological Society's
collection.
The structure of this species is similar to that of the more familiar
male Little Crake (Porzana parva), being somewhat like a miniature
chicken in appearance with a short pointed bill, short neck, very short
rounded wings, short tail, and comparatively long legs for wading in
water and long toes specially adapted for walking on aquatic vegetation.
The markings too are not unlike those of the commoner bird, although
the upper-parts are more chestnut in tone, and coming from the head,
extends to the sides of the breast (in the Little Crake it continues in a
more or less straight line round to the shoulders) ; the under-parts
are white with broad black vertical bars on the flanks (in the Little
Crake this is slate-grey, with white bars on flanks and black and white
on under-tail coverts). The bill is black with lemon-yellow base, iris
crimson, legs and feet vermilion.
When a group of birds have lived together for any length of time,
they form what is known as a " peck-order ", i.e. as the result of
consistent fighting, or, as in this case, consistently assertive behaviour,
they result in a social hierarchy of dominance and submission ; the
dominant bird (the winner of the greatest number of contests) is called
the Alpha, and the most subordinate bird (the loser of the greatest
number of contests) is called the Omega. In this particular aviary,
a male Princess Stephanie's Bird of Paradise seems to be the Alpha
(this is probably because the others are frightened by its rustling flight
and long tail--it seldom actually attacks them), and these crakes the
Omegas. Timid though they are (though not so shy and retiring as
many other crakes), they show a great reluctance to fly and will not
do so unless necessity is absolute, and will normally run from danger,
sometimes using the wings for added propellent. On the few occasions
when it is necessary, however, it is only but a very weak effort, and for
a very short distance, the legs being dangled ; they are very difficult

to put up a second time. In this aviary they spend most of their time on
the ground, but when two were kept in the Tropical House (next door
to the Bird House), they were more often sitting side by side in the tree
trunk forks than on the ground (the branches in this aviary are perhaps
not thick enough for them to sit comfortably in them). The gait is
made up of rather long strides, with head bobbed, legs raised high, and
toes drawn together with each elevation ; the head is usually held
somewhat lowered. The tail is bobbed when nervous.
When on the quest for food (which accounts for quite a large
percentage of their waking hours), the bird looks toward the ground,
head lowered, and occasionally prods a dead leaf or twig, even though
consumption is obviously quite unintentional. When a titbit is located,
however, the bird seizes it with a sharp stab of the bill, sometimes
bobbing the tail. When bathing, the head is first ducked under water,
it is then raised quickly, thus throwing water over the back, upon which
the wings and tail are flapped vigorously, thus bathing the whole body ;
this is followed by much preening, flapping of wings, and quivering of
tail, and afterwards the wings are partly opened (so that the leading
edges are at right angles to the body) to dry them, the inner secondaries
overlapping on the back. When looking for food around the aviary,
they were usually solitary, but when sunbathing, would usually gather
together with their bodies touching and much social preening was
done ; even when not grouped together one individual would some-
times approach another and thrust its head under its companion's
chin, whereupon it was preened as required. They would sometimes

stand on one leg when dozing, with bill tucked under back feathers ;
dozing was also done when crouched right down on belly.
These birds did not show a very wide vocabulary--indeed the only
utterances that I ever heard, were a low squeak and a prolonged
throaty chatter, the latter being delivered with neck extended.
In the wild, leucopyrrhus , like other members of the Rallidae, exists on
an omnivorous diet (which, incidentally, partly explains why the rail
family is so widespread), but in the zoo they thrive on a mixture of
boiled egg, carrots and rice, minced-meat, insect-mixture, and biscuit-
meal ; they also relish seed (white millet and canary), live house-flies,
mealworms, and maggots.
This species, which is also known as the Red and White Crake, was

The Southern White-breasted Crake lives naturally in south-eastern
South America.

BREEDING RESULTS AT OLDHILL IN 1965
By A. V. Marques (Studham, Bedfordshire, England)
The following are some details of my breeding results at Oldhill
Wood during 1965 :--
Barnard's Parrakeets, 4 ; Bauer's, 2 ; Blue-bonnets, 11 ; Crimson-
wings, 2 ; Green-winged Kings, 4 (in two rounds) ; Green Rosellas,
12 ; Kings, 3 (on breeding terms) ; Mealy Rosellas, 7 ; New Zealand
Red-fronted, 3 ; New Zealand Yellow-fronted, 3 ; Pileated, 5 ;
Princess of Wales, 2 ; Rock Peplars, 2 ; Pennant's, 16 ; Yellow
Red-rumps, 3.
I bred fewer Bourke's, Elegants, Splendids, Blue-wings, and Tur-

quoisines than in previous years ; this I attribute, rightly or wrongly,
to the changeable weather at the time when the Grass Parrakeets began
to nest early in April.
Interesting recent additions to the collection include two pairs of
blue Quaker Parrakeets, two pairs of Timor Crimson-wings, three
Hooded Parrakeets, a pair of Brown's Rosellas, and a pair of Rock
Grass Parrakeets.
I was also lucky enough to obtain, through the good services of my
friend Dr. Humberto Ferreira of Rio de Janeiro, a pair of the beautiful
and rare Spix Macaws, as well as other South American birds.
At the time of writing (20th December) there are two three-day old
Hooded Parrakeets bred from a pair nesting inside a heated greenhouse,
with access to an unheated flight covered in a plastic " tent In
another greenhouse, a pair of Red-fronted New Zealand Parrakeets
are making a good job of rearing their three-week old chicks, and a
pair of the Yellow-fronted have just hatched their clutch of four eggs.

All these pairs are supplied with extra lighting to enable them to feed
their young for a longer period than would normally be possible at this
time of the year.
I would be interested to hear from any member of the Avicultural

exchange of views on the subject.

A specimen of Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha , the Thick-billed Parrot, has
been deposited, the first of this species to be in the collection. The
Thick-billed Parrot is the only member of its genus ; it inhabits the
pine forests of the Mexican highlands and occasionally appears in
the mountains of Arizona and New Mexico. The pinyon nut, seed of
the pines, is one of the chief foods of this parrot. Blake {Birds of Mexico)
mentions a second species, Rhynchopsitta terrisi, but this is not recognized
by others so far as I have been able to trace.
Specimens of Jerdon's Imperial Pigeon {Ducula badia cuprea ) and a
Little Scaly-bellied Green Woodpecker {Picus xanthopygceus) have also
been received and are species not previously in the collection.
Two Spur-winged Plovers and a pair of Siamese Fireback Pheasants
bred by the Societe Royale de Zoologie d'Anvers, three Eider Ducks
from Mr. Tom Spence, a pair of Tonkinese Red Junglefowl from
Mr. Philip Wayre, a Blue and White Flycatcher and a Superb Glossy
Starling from Mrs. D. Ashken, a pair of Bullfinches and a Tree
Sparrow from Mr. F. C. Astles, a Saker Falcon, a Shikra, and a Tawny
Eagle are other noteworthy arrivals.
Four Black Swans and two Chinese Necklace Doves have been bred
in the Gardens and the pair of Spotted Eagle-Owls, one received in
1952 and the other in 1954 appear to become more prolific with age,
for after rearing two families this year, they are now nesting again.
Two years ago they brought up a family during the winter.
A Forster's Milvago received in March, 1937, has died.

Mention of P. W. Louwman immediately conjures up visions of
Wassenaar and its magnificent collection of birds. Many, of course,
know that Mr. Louwman has one of the finest libraries of ornithological
works in the world. But it may come as a surprise to some to learn that
Mr. Louwman is a vintage car enthusiast. In his fifty-vehicle collection
he has cars dating from 1898.

In the British Isles the Avocet, Recurvirostra avosetta, formerly bred
from the Humber to Sussex, but it disappeared as a breeding species in
1842 or 1843. Then two pairs bred in Ireland in 1938, and in 1947
four pairs bred on Havergate Island and four at nearby Minsmere,
in Suffolk. By 1957 the colony on Havergate Island had increased to
about ninety pairs, and last year fifty-two pairs reared seventy-eight
young.

W. R. Carthew, Vereeniging, South Africa, is to be congratulated
on his success in breeding the Grey-necked Crowned Crane, Balearica
regulorum. I believe there is only one previous record of success, that
of Sir David Ezra, in Calcutta, in 1934. On that occasion two young
ones were hatched but one was a weakling and soon died. The other
was a strong, healthy bird and was six months old at the time of the
account (see Avicult. Mag., 1935, 59 ; and two photographs of the
young one with its parents).

Several readers have inquired regarding the identity of " Ringo "
mentioned in the " Tail Piece " to these notes in the last number of the
Magazine. " Ringo " is a Thick-billed Parrakeet, Rhynchopsitta pachy-
rhyncha. This species is now regarded as the sole remaining member of
the Order Psittaciformes occurring in America. It breeds, so far as is
known, only in the pine belt of the mountains of northern and middle
Mexico, but it wanders sporadically, and at times abundantly, north
to the mountains of south-central and south-eastern Arizona. Dr.
Karl Plath once owned one of these rare parrakeets and his painting
of it was reproduced in the April, 1927, number of the Magazine.

B. G. Donnelly, Port Elizabeth Museum ( The Ostrich , 1965, p. 145),
records an interesting case of longevity in the Yellow-backed Bishop,
Euplectes capensis. He writes : " On 15 December, 1963, a hand-
reared male Yellow-backed Bishop kept in captivity since February,
1945, died through inadvertent exposure. This extremely tame bird
was caged throughout its life except for occasions when it was allowed
to fly around in a house.
Though it was crippled and flightless for the last five years of its
existence, it still came into breeding plumage each year, retained its
healthy appetite and remained in excellent condition. Brought in as
a nestling by an African, it lived for eighteen years, ten months."

Despite regulations which virtually prohibit the importation of birds
into Australia from any part of the world except New Zealand a
representative collection has been maintained at the Adelaide Zoolo-
gical Gardens. The Eighty-seventh Annual Report of the Royal Zoological
Society of South Australia , 7964-65, says that excellent breeding results,
possibly the best for several years, were achieved during the period under
review. Nearly 200 birds of fifty-two different species or varieties were
hatched and reared to independence. Amongst the psittacines there
were six Red-capped, three Hooded, thirty-one Neophema of six species,
including Rock, and a Scarlet X Blue and Yellow Macaw hybrid. An
unusual hybrid was an Australian White Ibis X Straw-necked Ibis.

The genus Coturnix , comprising the true quails, consists of but
five species, one of which is extinct, with an additional nine races.
David Seth-Smith was always particularly interested in quail of all
species, and in the days before his long association with the Zoological
Society of London they were well represented in his collection at
Addiscombe. There he bred the Harlequin Quail, C. delegorguei , and
the Stubble Quail, C. pectoralis, both in 1906, and the Rain Quail,
C. coromandelica. The two first-named were first successes, but the last
had been bred by his brother Leslie in 1903. The Harlequin is the
most handsome of the four species and it is pleasing to note that Jeffrey
Trollope has recently succeeded in rearing three. Four chicks were
hatched but one disappeared a couple of days later.

During the spring, 1965, the Trumpeter Swans in the Philadelphia
Zoo laid seven eggs. The first cygnet hatched on 25th June, to be soon
followed by two more. The parents then wandered off with the three
young ones. Two of the deserted eggs were removed to an electric
incubator, and both were successfully hatched on 3rd July. They
were introduced into the nest and very fortunately the parents accepted
them. All five were successfully reared--the first Trumpeter Swans to
be reared in captivity in the United States--a triumph for John A.
Griswold, Curator of Birds.
Within a few days of the first Trumpeter Swan cygnet being hatched
in the Philadelphia Zoo another success was reported in the United
States. Six cygnets were hatched in the City Park Zoo, Great Bend,
Kansas, on 28th and 29th June, 1965.

The passing of the Dowager Queen Elisabeth of the Belgians is
reason enough for the retelling of a special event in the history
of the Society. When on a visit to Belgium in the autumn of
1947, Miss P. Barclay-Smith learnt from the late Madame Gustav
Derscheid that Her Majesty would welcome a pair of Black Swans for
the lakes at the Palace of Laeken. On her return to England Miss
Barclay-Smith suggested to our President Mr. Ezra that it would be a
very nice gesture if the Society were to present a pair to Her Majesty,
as a token of friendship between Great Britain and Belgium. Mr. Ezra
immediately agreed and, with his characteristic generosity, offered to
defray all expenses. It was hoped to obtain a pair of swans from
Chartwell, but Sir Winston was unwilling to part with any of his small
stock. However, a brood of five was hatched at Leckford in the autumn,
1948. Mr. Terry Jones selected a pair and at the end of May, 1949,
they were sent to the Antwerp Zoo where M. Walter Van den berg
kindly took charge of them till they were taken to Laeken. When the
Society's small presentation party arrived they found that owing to

illness the Queen was confined to her private apartments. Her Majesty,
nevertheless, expressed the wish to have the swans presented to her
personally, and so they were taken to her room in a basket.
Fortunately the presentation passed off without mishap. The swans
behaved perfectly and, much to the delight of the Queen, pecked
delicately at her bed-cover thinking it was something good to eat.
They were later released on one of the lakes at Laeken and settled
down well.

AUSTRALIAN FINCHES IN BUSH AND AVIARY. By K.

Immelmann. Angus and Robertson, Ltd., Sydney, London, and
Melbourne, 1965. Price 4.2s.
In 1932 Neville Cayley's book on Australian grassfinches, with the
coloured plates which he had painted, was published. It contained not
only descriptions of the birds in the wilds but also included the
information available from aviculturalists, and it probably helped to
make these birds some of the most popular of aviary inmates. In the
period since its publication a great deal has been learned about these
birds, much of it based on the study of species kept in aviaries in
Britain and Europe.
Dr. Immelmann has studied some species, the Zebra Finch in
particular, as aviary subjects ; and in the present volume he has
utilized this, together with all the additional information now available,
and his study of the wild birds during a year in Australia, to produce
a new book on the Australian grassfinches. The text has been entirely
rewritten, but Cayley's pleasant colour plates (with the exception
of those of hybrids) have been retained. The amount of information now
available has made it possible to include detailed data on such
aspects as behaviour and courtship displays for all species, as well as
up-to-date avicultural information on the keeping and breeding of
each species. The general scope of the work can be seen from the

following subheadings in a typical chapter on one bird, the Masked
Grassfinch : Names, Description, Distribution, Geographic variation,
Field notes, Food and feeding habits, Drinking habits, Galls, Courtship
and mating, Site and nature of nest, Breeding, social activities ;
Aviary notes--Housing, Food, Breeding, Hybrids.
This book contains the summarized results of a great deal of research
into all aspects of the species concerned, including such things as
mouth-markings in the young, and colour-inheritance in Zebra
Finches. The insistence on unripe seed and insects as food for grass-
finches in aviaries makes one wonder if a greater emphasis on these at
an earlier date, rather than reliance on dry seed mixtures, might have
prevented the virtual disappearance of some species from aviculture
since the export ban.
This is an excellent and valuable work, a " must " for any avi-
culturalist interested in these birds. I was conscious of only two minor
defects--the omission of the distribution maps present in Cayley's work;
and the use of the incorrect family name " Spermestidae " for the
Estrildidae.

Hybrids Hyacinthine X Blue and Yellow Macaws
There are at present at the Tracy Aviary, Salt Lake City, three hybrids between a
male Hyacinthine and a female Blue and Yellow ( ararauna) Macaw, reared during the
last few years. They are all similar, large and more like the father in shape, dark blue,
with an irregular dark yellow band on the underparts.
Although all sorts of crosses and recrosses between ararauna, militaris, macao , and

Florida, I am not aware that hybrids between the Hyacinthine and another species
have been recorded before.

PSITTACINES OR PARROTS?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.771462666666667" page_id="56366259"  page_num="32" year="" vol="">
With reference to " News and Views " in the last issue (Vol. 71, No. 6) surely the
word " parrot " is the collective English name for the Psittacidae ?
Fisher and Peterson in The World of Birds, Austin in Birds of the World, and
Landsborough Thomson in A New Dictionary of Birds all list the different genera under
the general heading " Parrots " and give valid reasons for doing so.
" Psittacines " is too much of a tongue twister. " Parrotlike " is clumsy and as for
" Hookbills " what about all the birds of prey ?
I have always understood that a budgerigar is just as much a parrot as a macaw
or a lory ; in the same way that a merganser, pochard, or scoter are all ducks.

I am sorry I cannot add much to Mr. Cumming's letter on the above other than to
say that the nest of our White-capped Tanagers was very close to the roof of the aviary
and well concealed, hence it was necessary to enter the flight to see into the nest.
By that time the occupant or occupants were off! I never suspected that the cock
could have incubated the eggs as the hen always had the " ruffled " appearance of
having been disturbed when I approached. However, I hope the same pair will breed
again in the coming season and if so will keep a closer watch.

YELLOW BANDED GOLDEN PHEASANTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.887479166666667" page_id="56366260"  page_num="33" year="" vol="">
Your contributor Mr. Keith Wilkins writes about the Yellow Banded Golden
Pheasant saying that he hopes to clear up any misunderstanding on the matter, but
the misunderstanding appears to be still in Australia. He states that he set out on the
test mating programme and then informs us that he mated the Yellow Banded bird
back to its mother and proceeded to line-breed for several generations. This process is
of course the very opposite of test mating and he could have found out the genotype of
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.7998064" page_id="56366260"  page_num="33" year="" vol="">
his Yellow Banded cock by two very simple matings ; by mating the cock to a quite
unrelated Golden hen (which surely could have been found without undue difficulty).
Results should have been as follows :--
(i) If the bird was a dominant mutation at least 50 per cent of the young would
be Yellow Banded like the father, on the other hand if it was a recessive mutation all
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.951711083333333" page_id="56366260"  page_num="33" year="" vol="">
the young would be normal in the first generation.
Now if the original Banded cock is a recessive it must be a pure recessive otherwise it
would appear normal. However, it is reasonable to assume that its two parents must
each carry one recessive gene--thus if the Yellow cock was mated back to its mother
50 per cent should have been Banded in this instance, whether its mother was a
dominant or a recessive. In other words the table displayed on page 185 (Nov.-Dec.
Number, 1965) equally well fits the hypothesis that the bird was a recessive derived from
the latent gene remaining from a cross with a Lady Amherst Pheasant, possibly as many
as fifteen generations back.
The pale ruff is another factor which is encountered in cock Golden Pheasants
that contain a trace of Lady Amherst.
I would like to ask Mr. Wilkins the following questions :--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.948362666666667" page_id="56366260"  page_num="33" year="" vol="">
(1) Do any of the normal Golden Pheasants that occurred in 1960-61 generations
have pale ruffs ?
(2) How many hens were mated in each generation ?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9868135" page_id="56366260"  page_num="33" year="" vol="">
If one of the males with the Yellow Ruffs and Yellow Band is a pure dominant,
which it must be to fit Mr. Wilkins hypothesis, then all the young produced from the
mating of this bird with any unrelated normal Golden hen (all pure strain) will be
(in the case of the males) Yellow Banded. Thus the hypothesis can be proved true or
false in a matter of two years.
Lastly, with regard to the penultimate paragraph of the article, it was never
suggested that the cross with any Amherst had been a recent one and it may still be that
the other characters have already begun to appear (i.e. the pale ruff).
Meanwhile I think we should all reserve our judgement either way until proper test
matings have been carried out as outlined above.

SEXING FAIRY BLUEBIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979344263157895" page_id="56366261"  page_num="34" year="" vol="">
Since I wrote for the September-October number of the Magazine, giving details
of the rearing of two young Fairy Bluebirds that year, it has become obvious that
one can sex the youngsters at 2 to 3 months old.
When they left the nest--although they were not nest mates--the two young looked
identical in colour, having the overall smokey-blue colouring of the adult hen and
none of the cobalt-blue back and black-breast colouring of the adult male. One of the
second nest did appear to be slightly darker blue than the other, but this was only
apparent in certain lights.
However, now one can discern the outline of the black cheek marking of the male
on the later hatched youngsters and the body colour has assumed a more cobalt
colouring. There are also a few violet/cobalt feathers on the rump. The young hen---
an earlier hatched bird--is still the same overall smokey-blue colour. Both have a light
brown eye iris, unlike the ruby-red eye of the adult.
We also have a late brood of two young Blue-shouldered Mountain Tanagers. The
only obvious sexual difference with these, when fledged, is size. In colour they are
identical. They have none of the brilliant yellow head and body colour of the adult cock
and hen. They have the strong black eye stripe but their body colour is a pale creamy
yellow. The young hen is distinctly smaller with a finer beak.

<bodyText confidence="0.99902321875" page_id="56366262"  page_num="35" year="" vol="">
In March, 1964, the recommendations for suggested amendments
to the Protection of Birds Act, 1954, made by the Advisory Committees
for the Protection of Birds in England and Wales and in Scotland were
forwarded by the Home Office to both the Avicultural Society and the
National Council for Aviculture, among many other interested
organizations, for comment.
Among the proposed amendments was one allowing the Home
Office to grant licences for " taking birds for the purpose of aviculture
However, when the Bill to amend the 1954 Act was introduced into
the House of Lords by Lord Hurcomb in May, 1965, this provision,
with some others, was dropped. The Bill passed through all stages in
the House of Lords but, owing to the end of the Session, could not be
introduced into the House of Commons.
This omission of the provision allowing the granting of licences for
taking birds for the purpose of aviculture was discussed at the Council
meeting of the Avicultural Society on 15th November, 1965, and it was
decided to form a Sub-Committee to go into the matter and Messrs.
Colin Harrison, Claude Payne, and Philip Wayre were appointed.
On Mr. Harrison's departure for an expedition in Australia Mr.
Derek Goodwin took his place. The National Council for Aviculture
also appointed a Sub-Committee. Close liaison between the two was
maintained and it was decided to arrange for an amendment to be put
forward when the Bill came before the House of Commons.
The Bill was introduced into the House of Commons during the
present session by Colonel Sir Tufton Beamish, M.P., and passed its
Second Reading on 28th January, 1966. Thanks to the good offices
of Mr. Claude Payne, Mr. William Wilson, M.P. for Coventry South,
has undertaken to put forward an amendment to reinstate the provision
that licences may be granted for the taking of birds for the purpose of
aviculture when the Bill is being discussed in Committee (the first
opportunity that amendments can be put forward).
The aim of the amendment is to assist genuine breeders of British

By D. H. S. Risdon (Rode, Somerset, England)
1965 marks the end of our third summer since we officially opened in
May, 1962. The first year was largely taken up with getting together
a collection of birds as representative as possible. The second was spent
consolidating what we had. The third has shown some substantial
progress in that we are beginning to get some useful breeding results.
At the time of going to press the collection now consists of some 700
birds of 150 different species, and this is being continually added to.
The parrot collection was greatly enriched this year by the acquisi-
tion of the whole of Gerald Kirkham's collection from Dublin. This
was transferred complete with thirty-three aviaries to Rode and was
quite a major operation as temporary housing had to be found for the
birds whilst the aviaries were in transit by sea and rail. We got over the
problem by splitting the consignment into three separate lots, sending
the first lot of aviaries in advance so that they could be re-erected and
waiting for the first lot of birds. This collection has given us such
treasures as Crimson-wings, Derbyans, Lutino Ringnecks, Leadbeater's
Cockatoos, Philippine Island, Citron Crested and Umbrella Cockatoos,
Patagonian Conures, and Pennant's Parrakeets. Many of these are
not on show to visitors as it was thought more important to establish
them as breeding stock away from disturbance.
Other recent additions have been Pelicans, Spoonbills, Scarlet and
Sacred Ibis, Lidth's Jay, Hartlaub's and Pinkcrested Touracos, and
Giant Whydahs and Azure Jays.
Although they have not always been successful, one of the most
rewarding things I have done here has been my attempt to establish
various species at liberty, or at least controlled liberty. I had long
wanted to do this but the opportunity was not there until I came to
Rode. One needs a fair acreage for one thing, well wooded and
watered, and it is essential to be surrounded with open country--not
built-up areas--if one is not to be a nuisance to one's neighbours. All
these things I bore in mind during our long search for a suitable site
on which to start the Tropical Bird Gardens.

38 D. H. S. RISDON-THE TROPICAL BIRD GARDENS 1 965
To me one Golden Pheasant on the lawn against a background of
green bushes which runs towards you and not away from you is worth
half-a-dozen in an aviary forever running up and down the wire ; and
a pair of macaws in flight like great blue butterflies against the sombre
background of English conifers makes one's heart miss a beat every
time one sees them.
We have done well with macaws of which we now have fifteen, some
full-winged and some wing-clipped, but all free about the grounds
during the day. Not all of them make good homers. The tamest and
friendliest of them all is quite hopeless. Every year he grows his flight
feathers anew and takes off in a straight line only stopping when he
lands exhausted in the middle of a public highway miles away, or else
he gets into the topmost branches of the highest tree he can find and
stays there until rescued.
The Blue-and-Yellows have raised a young one each year for two
years although tragedy overtook this year's offspring. The one bred the
previous summer has remained wild and will not approach us, although
it homes well, so this year I brought the young one into the house as
soon as it was fledged, intending to keep it there for a week or two so
that it could become accustomed to people. Two days later it died
quite suddenly in a fit although apparently a perfect and healthy
specimen.
Young macaws seem to make the best liberty birds as they fly in
groups and do not quarrel, but as they mature they become territorial
and each pair attempts to fly other established pairs off the premises.
We get over this by letting them out on alternate days.
I think the Red-and-Yellow species is the most spectacular in flight,
the vivid orange-red contrasting with the yellow patch in the blue
wings shows up brilliantly against a green background.
We have what appear to be two quite distinct colour phases of the
Blue-and-Yellow Macaw. The common one is turquoise with yellow
breast and belly. The other, which I have not seen very often is
a darker, almost royal, blue and the breast is a deep golden yellow. The
difference is quite noticeable when the two races are seen together.
There are also two types with the Scarlet or Red-and-Yellow. One
has a much larger and more brilliant patch of yellow in the wings. At
first I thought this might have to do with sex but now I doubt it. We
have three--two with bright yellow wing patches and one with very
little--but none of them will have anything to do with the others.
We have two pairs of the Moluccans, one pair of which is tame and
these are the most destructive of all parrots. Macaws are pretty bad
but none of them can go through a solid piece of timber like a cockatoo.
We have two pairs of the Moluccans, one pair of which is tame and
allowed their liberty. We have to watch them, however, for in no time
they will ring bark the limb of a tree and kill it. The cock who can fly

makes a bee-line for the house and stables whenever he can and proceeds
to demolish the interior woodwork, but the thing that terrifies us all is
when he lands and swings on the high tension overhead electric cable
which supplies most of our source of heat and light, treating it like a
trapeze. One slice from that great beak and . . . !
Considering their size and the strength of their beaks Moluccans
seem the gentlest and most intelligent of all the cockatoos. Their great
delight is to be petted and talked to. This is not cupboard-love, but
genuine affection for people.
One pair of Roseates reared three nice young ones last summer
bringing our total up to seven of this species. Leadbeater's raised our
hopes by laying at least twice but did not sit properly. The same
remarks apply to Citron Crests. Umbrellas spent a good deal of time
in their barrel but that was as far as they went. We have a pair of the
delightful little Philippine Island Cockatoos, but they made no attempt
to nest.
Besides the Moluccans we have tried two Greater Sulphur Crests at
liberty. One " Sigee ", an inveterate feather plucker, is a good stayer
and a beautiful flier, but is apt to become a nuisance as he takes a
dislike to anyone who works here myself included. It is his special
pleasure to dive-bomb us from ambush in the trees, usually when we
are carrying something and have both hands full and are unable to
defend ourselves. With strangers and visitors he is as good as gold
especially with women, but at times these attacks on us become such
a menace that he has to be confined to barracks for a while. He came
to us as a feather-plucker and in spite of complete liberty his breast is
still as bare as ever.
The other one, " George ", a magnificent bird in perfect feather
made a good liberty bird for a while and the two of them on the wing
together gliding in and out of the trees made an unforgettable sight.
Then after some months " George " decided to leave. He was plotted
across country to Wooten-under-Edge about 30 miles away where he
seemed to take up residence and it was a fairly easy matter to trap him
in a Jackdaw cage-trap baited with another cockatoo. This is a bird of
a much smaller race though not a Lesser Sulphur Crest. It gets on well
with " George " and I rather hoped it might be a hen but it has black
eyes.
While most cockatoos can be sexed by the colour of the eyes I only
ever remember seeing one Greater Sulphur Crest with brown irides.
If they are subject to the same difference in sex there must be very few
hens about.
Breeding results among the rest of the parrot collection were
average. Eclectus laid several clutches of infertile eggs. The hen is
tame and I fear prefers the company of human beings to that of her
mate. Black-capped Lories hatched a chick but failed to rear it.

40 D. H. S. RISDON-THE TROPICAL BIRD GARDENS 1965
Swainson's Lorrikeets reared one. Chattering Lories laid but did not
hatch.
Rosellas and Stanleys reared some nice young ones. Pennant's and
Barraband's laid but reared nothing. Kings reared a young one which
died after leaving the nest and the same thing happened with Princess
of Wales. These young birds fledged in the pouring wet of last summer
which may have had something to do with it.
Ringnecks did well, all four pairs producing some good young
including three lutinos. Derbyans reared two fine young ones as did
the Crimson-wings.
Greater Patagonian Conures reared four fine young which with last
year's brood brings our strength up to ten of these delightful birds.
Their colouring may not be as bright as many other parrots, but what
they lack in this way they more than make up for in character and
intelligence.
One of our pairs of Purple Glossy Starlings reared four good young
in two broods. Last year they nested and partly reared a young one.
This year they made a proper job of it with the help of regular supplies
of maggots and mealworms throughout the day. Now at the time of
writing in January the irides of the young ones have turned white.
There is as yet no sign of the brilliant orange eyes so characteristic of
the adults.
Most of our insectivorous birds share large planted aviaries with other
species which inevitably compete with them for the live food. Other-
wise I think breeding successes would be greater. This applies particu-
larly to Spreo Starlings which attempted to nest several times. As time
progresses I hope to have more separate aviaries for breeding softbills
for we have the ideal spot in which to liberate them whilst rearing
young.
Among the jays and pies of which we have quite a collection the
Swainson's Blue Jays have nested and laid several times but always the
eggs have disappeared, presumably eaten by the parents. These are
I think the most savage of a bloodthirsty family. When we first had
them they shared a large enclosure with toucans. Blue Pies and birds
of similar size. After they had savaged a toucan these were removed
but some months later they set about a Blue Pie and so badly wounded
it that it died. After this they have lived on their own. In spite of their
evil natures they are birds of great beauty and character.
European jays also nested this year, but again the eggs vanished
after a week's incubation.
We reared a reasonable number of Mandarin and Carolina ducks.
This year as an experiment I reared fifteen Mandarins full-winged on
the lawn beside the house where there is a small pond. As they grew
their flights they became airborne and started perching all over the
place. Eventually they found their way down to the lake but each

morning would fly back to the house to be fed much to my delight.
My joy was shortlived however. Just about the time when the young
drakes were coming into colour they gradually ceased to come each
day and reverted entirely to the lake where the pinioned waterfowl
live. Each evening at dusk, and again sometimes at dawn, I hear
Mandarins flying over, but their numbers have dwindled and I never
see more than four or five birds on the wing.
Barnacle Geese reared their usual quota of goslings. Emperors laid
two clutches of infertile eggs. Common Shelduck behaved likewise.
One of the highlights of 1965 was the successful rearing of seven young
Grey Peacock-Pheasants. The old pair started to lay in February and
thereafter produced six clutches of two eggs at fortnightly intervals
which we set under silkies.
A nice batch of Swinhoe's was reared as well as Golden, Amherst,
Reeves's, and Silvers. All our Silver Pheasants are now at liberty and
when the hens hatch off we drive them into the nearest aviary for
protection until the chicks are old enough to roost at night. As we all
know Silver Pheasants are one of the most aggressive towards one
another in an aviary, but their natures change almost from the moment
they are free. In an aviary two cocks would murder one another yet
our little flock of about a dozen birds includes four adult cocks in full
plumage as well as several immature males. They keep together in
a more or less loosely connected group and bicker a good deal among
themselves, but there is little serious fighting because the vanquished
one can get out of the way.
Reeves's are the same. In an aviary they not only fight, but nearly
always ruin their tails and the hens are often wild and nervous. How-
ever, the moment they are free the reverse seems to happen--they
become tame and confiding--sometimes too much so for individual
cocks get aggressive and start chasing visitors. They also act as
policemen and many times I have seen them break up a fight between
two Peafowl or two Silver Pheasants. The cocks develop their full tails
at liberty and make a most spectacular sight in the evening as they take
off for their roosting places. They are remarkably adroit at turning and
twisting on the wing between tall trees, their long tails trailing like
comets behind them.
I have tried Goldens and Amhersts at liberty together but not very
successfully. Amhersts are more aggressive than Goldens and seem to
drive the Goldens away in the spring. We raise a number of both
species each year releasing the cocks and keeping the hens in aviaries.
I have tried letting out hens as well but they stay until the spring when
they go off in search of nesting sites and are never seen again. A few
young cocks stay, but many are driven off as the season advances. Those
which stay long enough to assume adult plumage become more or less
permanent residents so we always have a few about. The Golden

Pheasant is a lovely thing in any circumstances but at liberty, doubtless
due to the natural feeding, their colours seem to glow with an added
lustre.
The wet season was a disastrous one for the peafowl as their chicks
hatched just about the time the rain started. As each hen brought off
her brood she was shepherded carefully into the walled garden with her
young to give them some protection, but the poor little things just
drooped and died.
The Cape Penguins continue to lay and hatch their chicks practically
all the year round but always fail to rear them. This exasperating state
of affairs has been going on for three years. We have sought the advice
of Edinburgh, London, and Bristol Zoos. We have given them barrels
to nest in. We have let them make their own burrows in the ground.
We have tried additional feeding, even removing the chicks when they
hatch and handfeeding them, with no success. Somewhere there is
a missing link in the chain, but for the life of me I cannot find it. Had
we had even partial success we could have doubled our little flock of
eight birds. They have the freedom of the lake, but they are lazy birds
and seldom make use of it except at feeding time when they become
active, swimming and diving for sprats.
We are finding that under the semi-natural conditions at Rode
many of the birds which normally lose their colour in captivity are
getting it back. What intrigues me is that they lose colour with their
first moult and gradually get it back in successive years. This has
happened with Flamingos, a Venezuelan Cardinal, and Hunting
Cissas without any artificial feeding on our part. Our Flamingos are
much admired for the brightness of their pink. Our ponds have natural
bottoms and abound in freshwater shrimps and daphnia.
The Cardinal when it first arrived was bright red. Its first moult
with us it went the usual brick colour. This year it has regained its
original vivid scarlet. The Hunting Cissas, of which we have four
examples, all went blue soon after we had them and stayed so for a year.
Since then they have become progressively greener and, whilst they
have not regained the original golden-green of the wild bird, they are
what I would call jade green. Scarlet Ibis completed their first moult
with us last autumn, when they turned from scarlet to deep salmon-
pink. It remains to be seen what happens next year.
This makes me wonder whether loss of colour is due not so much to
diet deficiency, but possibly some glandular or even psychological
disturbance as a result of the profound change from the natural habitat
to an artificial one. After a year or so the bird becomes adjusted to its
new environment and regains its colour. Diet obviously does have an
important influence on plumage colour but the fact remains that several
of our species have regained it without any special help from us.
This account would not be complete without reference to our collec-

In my search for a suitable live food for the small waxbills, and
particularly the lovely little Avadavat, I had heard about whiteworms,
the great standby of the keepers of tropical fish. Until recently I have
not been able to breed whiteworms successfully so as to assure a regular
supply. I have from time to time purchased a pill box containing
a nucleus, at first for 2 s. 6 d., then as the price of whiteworms rose with
the cost of living (why, I have never been able to understand) for %s. 3 d.
from a Pet shop. As this nucleus never seemed to increase sufficiently,
probably due to the whiteworms' efficient methods of birth control,
I decided to make a real effort to overcome these little creatures'
apparent prejudice against large families. I had been told by one
person he had had great success by keeping the little darlings in
a greenhouse, feeding them upon porridge, bedded in moist earth in
a wooden box, over which a piece of glass was placed as a cover. Over
this glass was placed newspaper and in course of time, when the
covering paper was removed, the glass would be covered with white-
worms and all one had to do was to scrape the whiteworms off the
glass with a spoon. I must have used the wrong brand of porridge or the
wrong newspaper but with me the glass was never rendered opaque by
whiteworms. They seemed just to disappear, so a further visit to the
Pet shop and a further purchase was necessary. Then at long last, as
a result of many trials and errors, I found the way.
Nothing elaborate was required. It is true that under this house
which I inhabit is a magnificent set of cellars. In fact I had sometimes
thought what a wonderful refuge they would make for me and my
beloved Yorkshire terrier Susie, so much wiser than Man himself, who,
it would appear, as the result of his stupidity and greed would rain
death of a particularly horrible kind upon this earth. But these magnifi-
cent cellars were not really necessary for the success of this venture.
One room was sufficient. But it must be dark and cool with but one
electric light to be switched on when one came to nourish and to
collect the harvest and prepare the ground for the next crop.

drainage, through the slight gaps where the thin boards do not fit
close together, and they are easy to handle. And this is an advantage as
the advancing years make the moving of weights less congenial. And it
is to be noted that the earth which is to fill the shallow tray, as a home
for the whiteworms, must be friable and remain so. The earth must be
kept moist if the worms are to thrive. It must consist of a light loam
and peat and silver sand. I make up my mixture according to the
formula for John Innes Potting Compost. I stress the fact that the
earth must be kept moist. If the earth is soaking wet the worms will
drown. In this earth, then, I lay in shallow trenches dug with a dainty
trowel intended for other uses my nucleus, my breeding stock of these
small creatures and place upon them white bread, first soaked in water,
and then squeezed so the surplus water flow away and then I soak this
bread in milk and squeeze again. I then place this bread in suitable
narrow lengths upon the worms. Then with this narrow trowel, meant
for better things, I cover the bread with moistened friable earth. Over
this I place newspaper to conserve the moisture.
The worms seem to show no marked preference in reading matter.
The Daily Telegraph and the Financial Times both seem equally well to
serve their purpose. I then leave the little creatures to fulfil their
destiny. Every other day with careful steps I descend to the darkness
of the cellar and if the earth is drying out I water it with a dainty
syringe, again intended for another purpose and replace the covering
newsheet. After a week I have found the soaked bread has disappeared
and the worms have greatly multiplied. I then feed again with another
week's supply.
At first I was greatly puzzled as to how the food supply seemed so
rapidly to disappear and how, after about a fortnight, the whiteworms
used to disappear. I am not unused to disappearing tricks. I have
often during the long years of my service seen the Indian Rope Trick.
I remember one particularly gifted conjurer who used to bite off the
head of a living snake (the poor thing was small and harmless) which
he seemed to chew with great relish and then throw the body to the
waiting mongoose. That, I thought is old Adam getting his own back.
Then this same conjurer used to show some finely powdered glass to his
gaping audience and he used to chew and swallow this. That, I thought,
is one up on the ostrich. Then, this same gifted gentleman used to toss
off the contents of a tumbler of water, in which swam some goldfish--
it was true they were only tiny goldfish--and he then used to sneeze
violently and the goldfish were wriggling on the floor. This, I realized,
was the opposite of a disappearing trick ; it was indeed Jonah and

the Whale in reverse but I must tell this to make the picture whole.
But all this had nothing on the disappearance of the white worms
and the soaked bread. Then after profound meditation I tumbled to it.
The whiteworms devoured their food supply and then starved to
death. There was no sign of their remains or of their passing. Since
then I feed them once a week until on the third week I gather in my
harvest because the whiteworms having devoured their food supply,
have not yet had time to die. I have found if I bury the soaked bread
as near the bottom of the box as possible, the worms, presumably when
full fed, come to the top and I can scrape them up with a spoon. Then,
with this narrow trowel I gather up sufficient earth with worms to
cover the bottom of a small earthenware saucer which I place in the
waxbills' cage ; one filled saucer for one cage, while in other trays
similarly filled and nourished, other whiteworms thrive and multiply,
ignorant of their unhappy destiny. If fellow members should want
whiteworms in continuous supply I say, as it is written on a tombstone

BREEDING THE CATTLE EGRET

On 14th June, 1951, members of the " Biologische Station Wilhel-
minenberg, " on a trip to Tunisia brought back some young cattle
egrets from a colony at lake Aschkel. The birds were reared in the
Station and were kept in complete freedom up to 14th August of the
same year. But occasionally the Egrets flew off and, for instance, were
sometimes found in a swimming-bath at a distance of two kilometres
away, and were not able to find their way back to Wilhelminenberg.
Therefore we trapped them on 14th August.
The birds were mainly fed on fish from the North Sea, but in
addition they had plenty of opportunities for obtaining insects them-
selves. The Cattle Egret is not a highly specialized fish-eater, and
prefers insects, lizards and mice. The African Cattle Egrets especially,
are mainly to be found close by large mammals, such as elephants,
rhinos, hippos and buffaloes. They hunt for the insects disturbed by
these mammals and other small animals. Very often they catch
various insects directly from the backs of buffaloes or elephants. At

DR. KURT KOLAR-BREEDING THE CATTLE EGRET
Wilhelminenberg the members of the staff sometimes had to play the
role of elephants, and our Cattle Egrets freed us of flies and mosquitoes
in the above-mentioned manner.
Already during the first year we observed the first breeding behaviour
patterns. Such behaviour is very often to be found in different kinds of
young animals which are in a phase of development similar to human
adolescence.
We kept the egrets in an aviary (15 by 8 by 5 metres) with an
additional room for the winter. Half of this enclosure is grown over
with elder-hedges (2 metres high).
The Cattle Egret is the only species of heron able to breed in its first
year of life. This fact is some explanation of their rapid spread over
America and Australia.
At the beginning of May, 1952, we put the egrets in their outdoor
aviary and they were provided with small branches and short pieces of
reed for nesting. A few days later they started nesting. On 9th June
there were two eggs in one nest and, on 1st July, the first young Cattle
Egret hatched. A few days later three other chicks hatched. All four
birds were reared by their parents.
Since then the Cattle Egrets breed regularly at Wilhelminenberg.
During a great part of the year--from January to October--they are
ready for breeding. On 17th January, 1962, one pair had built a nest in
the winter-room. Young birds reared in the aviary do not construct
their own nest in the following year, but use the nest of their parents.
In order to introduce new blood on two occasions we added Cattle
Egrets from Israel to our stock. Often the young ones hatched during
a period of bad weather. In these cases we put the eggs in the incubator
and reared the young birds artificially.
There are several reasons for the successful breeding of our Cattle
Egrets. In the first place it must be realized that in the wild this
species nests in large colonies. One pair stimulates the other. There
should be the same situation in the aviary, and therefore we always
keep about thirty to forty of these birds. But breeding success mainly
depends on the right food. During the summer our Cattle Egrets have
opportunity to catch their flies from the fish-containers and in addition
to this they can catch some mice in the enclosure. They are fed with
fish from the North Sea, dead mice, and horse-meat. The fish are
covered with a powder of various kinds of food-additives and vitamins.
This mixture consists of (100 c.c.m. each) feeding-lime, dried cod-liver
oil, bone-meal, blood-meal, fish-meal, wheat-germ, sea-weed meal,
50 c.c.m. dried barm, 4 tabloids vitamin Bi, 2 tabloids vitamin B2 and

(Munia atricapilla)
By M. W. Stilwell (Lisbon, Portugal)
You will be interested to know that a pair of Black-headed Mannikins
[Munia atricapilla) have hatched and reared to maturity one offspring.
The pair were housed in a large outdoor aviary ten by two by two
metres, in which I keep a mixed collection of waxbills, mannikins,
doves and finches, some fifty birds in all.
I have bred regularly for the last few years Spice Finches (Munia
punctulata ) besides other species, so that when in mid-May last year
I saw these and the Mannikins carrying about nesting material
(grasses) I took little interest in the Mannikins, merely regarding their
actions as being influenced by the Spice Finches and that they would
not result in anything, as usual.
In June, I went away for three weeks' holiday in Spain and on my
return noticed, what I took to be six young Spice Finches flying around,
one of which was killed by a male Japanese Quail before it was able
to fly properly, and later I found two fully fledged young dead below
what I thought was a Spice Finch's nest. About a fortnight later that
is in early July, I noticed that one of the young was showing some
white primary feathers and that its beak was heavier than the others;
very quickly the beak began to turn blue-grey, the feet lead-grey and
the nails to grow considerably from which I realised that this must be a
young Mannikin, but as I also have Tri-Coloured Mannikins [Munia
malacca ), was uncertain with regard to the species and even thought it
might be a case of cross-breeding. But now with the moult complete
I find that this young bird is a Black-headed Mannikin, and from its
behaviour a young male.
With regard to food, I feed my birds on millet, hemp, large canary
and a mixture of seeds obtained from a rice mill with bits of broken
rice and paddy rice resulting from cleaning of the paddy before milling.
I regularly give them lettuce and when available seeding grasses,
as well as Stimulite No. i, but have never seen a Mannikin touch the
insectile mixture, and only now and again the lettuce. The Mannikins
have never shown much inclination for hawking insects in the air, so
I must assume that they brought up the young almost entirely on seeds
and some lettuce, and maybe odd insects picked up in the aviary. The
young bird has now completely lost the white on his wings.
Unfortunately, one of the parent birds has died, so I do not know if
I will ever be able to repeat this success, as it is so difficult to get pairs
to even build a nest.

By S. T. Johnstone (Slimbridge, Glos., England)
All four species of Merganser on the British list have long been
represented in our Slimbridge collection. The original pair of
Goosanders was caught at Staines reservoir, and a Red-breasted
Merganser came from the Devon coast as long ago as 1947. A year or
so later, a pair of Smew were caught for us in a Dutch decoy. The
fourth member of the family, the beautiful Hooded Merganser, can
scarcely be designated a British species. It is of course indigenous to
North America and its claim to be on the British list is based on four
identifications, the last being a female that was seen on the Shannon in
the Eighties. I don't imagine anyone had kept it for very long in
captivity until Mr. Pilling of Seattle had a pair of " pricked " birds.
These he force-fed for many days, his reward being that they sub-
sequently laid a clutch of eggs. The young hatched and with great
dexterity were reared. This success was repeated in succeeding years.
The first representatives of the species at the New Grounds were a pair
of these birds, presented to us by Mr. Pilling.
Goosanders generally nest high up in holes in trees but they will also
use well-hidden rock indentations and burrows. Red-breasted
Mergansers prefer the two last sites. Smew like holes in trees and
1 remember one Scandinavian ornithologist telling me it was common
to find Smew and Golden-eye using the same nest. Like the Smew,
Hoodies like hollow trees. At Slimbridge our sawbills are perforce
pinioned and in consequence their nesting proclivities are directed
towards artificially prepared sites. Small cider-barrels are very
durable provided attention is given annually to the metal bands.
Sometimes we have used them standing vertically on the ground with
a 4 inch diameter hole cut in the side of the upper half. Generally,
however, the barrel is placed horizontally in a fork of a tree some
2 or 3 feet from the ground. The inside has a liberal layer of wood pulp,
sawdust, soil or peat covered in dead leaves and grass, and a causeway
in the form of a branch is placed up to the 4 inch hole which has now
been cut in the barrel end. (We have orientated the opening to face
toward or away from both water and light, but we have no evidence
of the ducks' predilection for either position.) In the case of Goosanders
and Red-breasted Mergansers, we have found their eggs in barrels
already containing those of Carolinas. I recall one case of a nest
containing Goosander, Chiloe Wigeon, Marbled Teal, and Carolina
eggs. On the other hand the Smew and Hooded Mergansers have
always been most particular in selection of sites, and no other eggs have
been found in their nests.

Goosander eggs are rather like those of Shelduck in shape and colour.
Red-breasted Mergansers' are quite distinctive, dark buff and pointed
at one end. The Smews are much like Carolina eggs in size, shape, and
texture, furthermore the down is very similar and, bearing in mind
Carolinas use of nesting boxes, one should take care to identify the
sitting duck. Hooded Merganser eggs are quite distinctive, they are
almost spherical and dead white in colour.

I remember hatching a brood of ten Goosanders from wild eggs,
that they fed immediately on the trout fry put into their water tray,
but that in a short time they lost their waterproofing, and in conse-
quence a number were lost from chilling. Those remaining were
raised to the fully-feathered state by supplying only sufficient water for
drinking purposes and by keeping the birds indoors. The ducks at this
stage were conditioned to eat freshly killed eels cut into suitable sec-
tions. They were released onto a main pond where they became fully
waterproofed in 24 hours. Young reared from eggs laid by these birds
showed no tendency to wet feather. By this time an electricity supply
was available and we were able to give infra-red heat in cold and wet
weather.
Red-breasted Mergansers were first reared from eggs imported from
Iceland. One recalls that we had not laid on our supply of trout fry
and staff were fully engaged on fishing for sticklebacks. Initially these
were fed to the babies from a pair of forceps. One snag with sticklebacks
was their ability to stick out the prongs on their ventral surface to
avoid being swallowed. Soon the Mergansers were feeding on elvers
and strips of heart muscle and finally on freshly killed eels.
We have not had much success with Hooded Mergansers and, al-
though birds have laid freely and a number of young have been
hatched, none of these have been persuaded to feed and have died
after a few days. In fact, success with this species was not recorded
until we obtained day-old ducklings and well-incubated eggs from the
United States. The ducklings were given to a broody bantam that had
hatched some Carolinas and were placed in a Wildfowl Trust brooder.

The food provided included turkey starter crumbs covered in chopped
hard-boiled egg and a shallow tray of water and grit into which were
put quantities of live fresh-water shrimps. Whilst the former was hardly
eaten at all the shrimps were consumed in large numbers. After three
days the smallest trout fry obtainable were added to the diet. Hence-
forth, preference for the fish can be gauged by the fact that each bird
was consuming thirty to forty fry a day. As with the other sawbills
the trout were replaced with minced eel by the time the Hoodies were
feathering.
Our greatest success has been with probably the most beautiful
member of the family--the Smew. Eggs were obtained from the wild-
caught female in 1957 after she had been in captivity for four years.
The eggs were found in one of the nesting-barrels and, until the bird
was seen on the nest, were thought to be those of a Carolina. Incubation
lasted twenty-six days and three of the five eggs hatched. The downy
young of these delightful birds are almost indistinguishable, except in
size, from those of the Golden-eyes, and in consequence it would seem
that the Smew is a link between Mergus and Bucephala. The young were
put with the bantam into a Wildfowl Trust brooder. All kinds of live
food were made available for them, the larvae of chironomid, mosquito,
dragonfly, water boatmen, and fresh-water shrimp. The last were
preferred to all the others, a fortunate choice, for it was the only live
food we could obtain in any quantity. Turkey starter and chopped
egg were also provided and taken in small quantities. After three days
trout fry were introduced and were devoured in large numbers. As
the young birds grew, their intake of turkey starter crumbs increased
and the trout were replaced by sections of small eels. The birds reared,
breed annually, and the percentage reared has improved, although the
diet has been simplified to consist of hard-boiled egg, turkey starter
crumbs, trout fry, and minced eel. The clutches have never been less
than five or exceeded seven in number.

By Professor Carl Naether (Encino, California, U.S.A.)
None of my dictionaries, not even the Concise Oxford, lists " to-
getherness ", I was disappointed to learn, for it is such a common, even
trite, term in vogue even before the population " explosion " made its
debut. Well, trite though it may be, it applies with peculiar force to a
habit of a pair of Australian Plumed Doves, which I imported some
months ago from a Belgian bird-dealer.
Even though it has been my privilege and pleasure to keep and
observe at close range many a mated pair of foreign doves of many
species, none, I can truthfully report, " indulged " in togetherness to
the extent that these charming Plumed Doves have day in and day out
month after month, ever since their arrival sometime last November.
When they arrived here, after twenty-one days in quarantine in New
York, where, incidentally they received conscientious care, it was cold,
sunshine prevailing through the day and slight frost through the night.
Though I placed the pair in a solidly covered pen upon arrival, the
hen during the first night showed discomfort, the doves sleeping side by
side--close together. Since they had undoubtedly been kept in heated
quarters in quarantine, I promptly provided for some warmth in their
pen by placing a ioo-watt electric bulb under an old brooder cover,
which I kept burning day and night. To attract the doves to this
cozy retreat, I moved all their feed dishes, containing various kinds of
millet, so-called wild-bird seeds, and crushed sunflower seed, into the
lighted area.
The scheme succeeded : the very next night, the two birds slept,
sitting closely side by side, in one of the feed dishes, which they sought
out also later on cool days. But now let me explain their habit of being
always together. In point of fact, these two birds are inseparable--
where the one is--the hen, there the cock is also. If she decides to
move about, he will follow her without delay. And always there is
communication between the two, with the male calling out distinctly
and his mate responding softly but surely every time. I assume that in
their native habitat, where they sojourn in grasslands and low shrub-
bery, the male bird often loses sight of his mate ; hence the frequent
(and quite melodious) calling by both of them. I had occasion to
separate the male not long ago in order to photograph him in a glassed-
in cage especially made for this purpose. The result--the hen seemed
disconsolate, and he extremely frightened. Being tame otherwise in the
aviary, they gave me the impression that it would be a comparatively
simple task to catch one of them quickly, and then to pose him or her
suitably. However, the moment I stepped into their pen, catching-net
in hand, the doves stopped running about, and in swift, powerful, but

ponderous flight they boomed against the aviary wire, then dropped
down only to disappear swiftly in the shrubbery, one of them crawling
into a shallow hole. It was many hours before they left their hiding
places. Ever since they have evinced a pronounced dislike of their
keeper, shunning him the moment he comes into their aviary. Realizing
only too well that such behaviour augurs ill so far as future breeding
tendencies are concerned, he is determined to respect their sensitivity
to being caught up and handled, their right to privacy in captivity.
But what of the effect which seemingly the lighted bulb has had on
these lovely little doves ? They had been in my possession only about
ten days when I observed them building a nest : the hen was sitting in
a flat, porcelain seed-dish, and the cock was fetching sticks and twigs,
which she arranged round about her. No soft material, such as dry
grasses and leaves, but only hard twigs and sticks were piled together
atop of a layer of millet. Two days later, I found an egg in the nest--
pure white, almost round, and smaller than the Ring Dove's egg.
Neither bird deigned to incubate, and no second egg was laid. Placing
the egg under some Ring Doves, I soon found that it was infertile.
After I took the nesting material away, the Plumed Doves, following
ten days' recess, built again, this time in another feed-dish, but laying
two eggs--and leaving them without incubating a single day. The
nest, it should be stated, was each time located directly underneath the
lighted electric bulb.
The doves' third nest, strangely enough, must have been built during
the night, since I noticed no nest-building activities during the day.
The next morning, to my great surprise, as I went about feeding my
birds and doves, I was on the point of emptying a shallow water-pan--
it was about 2J inches deep and stood atop a low bench--when I saw
that it was filled with numerous sticks and twigs--the Plumed Doves'
third nesting effort ! Here I undoubtedly missed the almost unique
opportunity of seeing the hen Plumed Dove standing in the shallow
water-pan, into which her faithful, co-operative mate would drop bits
of nesting stuff, most of which, being very light, would float about for
some time before sinking to the bottom. Of course, as a matter of fact,
I did NOT see her standing in the water-pan : I only assume that
instinctively she would have followed the same procedure of receiving
the material from her mate and arranging it suitably, which she pursued
when building the first two nests. Several days later, I found an egg
laid on top of a cupboard, which also proved infertile.
At this writing (end of January) the egg-laying has stopped. The
doves are apparently becoming more and more acclimatized, for even
though we still have frosty nights (it's been a cold winter in Southern
California !) and cool days, they seek the lighted, warm shelter only
occasionally. They will not sleep in it as they did for some weeks, but
away from it under some shrubbery. However, during the coldest

part of the very early morning, both will be found sitting side by side
in one of the feed dishes directly below the lighted bulb.
It may perhaps be assumed, with some reasonableness, that the day-
and-night burning of the ioo-watt light induced these doves to nest and
to lay eggs several times. At no time, during weeks of observation, did
the writer note mating activities, only continuous " togetherness ",
with the male evidencing devoted fondness of his mate, always in a
gentle sort of manner, never driving her, as is the instinctive tendency
among other species of doves. This observer's task now is to regain the
" confidence " of these lovely creatures to the extent that they will
once more become fairly tame and tractable, and perhaps nest and lay
fertile eggs. He has not raised Plumed Doves in his many years of
keeping foreign doves. What is more, they have raised their own young
in very, very few American aviaries, and are quite scarce at this writing.

By F. E. B. Johnson (Stagsden, Bedford, England).
About 1950 I was becoming increasingly disturbed by the fact that
of the many beautiful birds that were in danger of extinction, the
Phasianidae seemed particularly threatened, containing as it does
numerous species that occupied a very limited range in the wild. With
the increasing encroachment of civilization, the permanent loss of many
of these was imminent. This is all very well known to aviculturists now,
but fifteen years ago it seems to have occurred to only a few people.
Obviously, unless something was done quickly by individual breeders,
it was going to be too late to save many species. With this in mind,
I bought a number of the rarer birds then still obtainable and started
to breed them as a spare-time hobby. The nucleus of the original
collection consisted of a pair of Tragopans, a pair of Elliot's, and a pair
of Copper Pheasants. Young birds from the original stock were sold
each year to help defray expenses and to acquire additional stock, until
eventually the collection became so large that it was a full-time occu-
pation.
Soon it became evident that it would be necessary to employ help,
both to look after the birds and to assist with the increasing volume of
correspondence, and other things indirectly connected with the enter-
prise. I decided therefore that to meet these ever-increasing expenses
the Gardens would have to be open to the public. I also felt that this
might help to increase the popularity of pheasants--a surprising
number of people have no idea that any species other than the common
Ring-necked Pheasant of the British countryside exists.

F. E. B. JOHNSON-STAGSDEN BIRD GARDENS
The collection now consists of forty-eight different species and
varieties of pheasants and other gallinaceous birds, about thirty species
of waterfowl, and some Australian parakeets, toucans, and several
similar species of foreign birds.
Also on view will be Budgerigars and Red factor Canaries, as well as
domestic pigeons, poultry and bantams of the more attractive and un-
usual breeds. I was sure that while these domestic birds are familiar
enough to their devotees, they are not often on view to the general
public, and many people would welcome the chance of seeing them.
This has proved to be indeed the case. Many of them, particularly the
old breeds of domestic poultry, are in great danger of dying out, as these
days too few people have facilities for keeping them. It would be a
pity to see them go, as they are very attractive.
Up to the time when I decided to open to the public, this was, as
I have said, entirely a breeding establishment, so we did not have to
worry too much about appearances, but work is now going on to make
the Gardens themselves more attractive to the public generally, while
at the same time we are doing our best to retain the natural rural
atmosphere. We are planting large numbers of roses both of the wild
species and cultivars of the shrub type, in a setting of grass. Many
ornamental shrubs have also been planted, and other plants will be
added from time to time.
I feel that the sympathy of the public towards conservation will be
greatly enhanced when they can visit places like this, where birds are
not only on show, but are being bred in large numbers. A great many
pheasants are bred here each year--for example in 1965 we bred
thirty-eight Hume's Bar-tailed Pheasants, thirteen Satyr Tragopans,
fifteen Himalayan Monals, and over thirty Copper Pheasants, to quote
only some of the rarer examples. The sale and distribution of them in
Great Britain, and to countries abroad, must surely ensure that very
many small nucleus breeding stocks are established.

By C. H. F. af Enehjelm
(Zoological Gardens, Helsingfors, Finland)
Owls are fascinating birds, possessing many characters which recom-
mend their keeping as aviary birds. They are intelligent, comparatively
easy to keep, quite hardy and some species are good breeders in
captivity. The sexing is not usually very easy, as there are no obvious
secondary sex characters in most species. It is maintained that the hens
are generally bigger than the cocks, but I have found that this has not
been the case in most of my successful breeding pairs.
I have, for instance, had more European Eagle-Owls in my care
than most aviculturists, for the simple reason that I always buy all
young birds offered to us, in order to save them from being killed and
sold for set-up specimens. Unfortunately this beautiful bird is not yet
completely protected in Finland, though now it is at least protected
in the woods belonging to the government. Formerly many young
birds were offered to us every year, nowadays, the number has decreased
so that we have not had a single specimen in some years. I am afraid
however that this must be considered as an indication of decrease of
the species in the wild state. It is to be hoped that stricter protection
of this species, as is fortunately the case with most other species of owls
and birds of prey, will be given before it is too late. The size of the
birds has varied considerably, without being a sure guide as to the sex.
I have kept birds from the same nest in different aviaries in order to
sex them, but even when birds from the same nest have been of different
size, the hens, which have manifested their sex by laying eggs, have
certainly not always been the largest birds of the brood.
Breeding birds successfully is always to some extent the luck of the
game, and to me the European Eagle-Owl (Bubo bubo bubo ) is almost
a classical example. Many years ago I had two very good breeding
pairs, which reared two or three young ones every season. Through
bad luck I lost one of the partners in each pair, and now I have not
bred one for several years despite the fact that I have kept four or
five pairs in separate aviaries for several years. On the other hand,
I am glad to say that practically all pairs we have sent to other zoos
have been successful breeders. In the East Berlin Zoo this year I saw an
excellent aviary with six or seven birds, and as far as I remember at
least two pairs had brought up young successfully. I have now put,
what I hope to be, four pairs--eight birds in any case in a large aviary
and shall be interested to see if I will be more successful next year.
I have also four pairs in separate aviaries to make a new trial.
I know another example of the same kind. Copenhagen Zoo got
a pair of the Turckmenian Eagle-Owl (j Bubo bubo omissus ) from Trans-

caspia. (See Peters' Checklist , vol. iv, page 116.) This owl is somewhat
lighter in colour than the nominate form, possibly even a bit larger.
The pair bred successfully in Copenhagen and I got a pair of young
from them in 1963, which bred successfully in 1965, and brought up
two young, I believe Copenhagen was also successful with their pair
later on. But the remaining birds of the original importation have
not yet bred, as far as I know, in spite of very good accommodation.
Almost an equivalent to my bad luck with the nominate form. I
emphasize that it is absolutely impossible to discover any kind of
difference in the parent birds.
In 1963 we got a young pair of Kenya Eagle-Owls [Bubo capensis
mackinderi) from Regent's Park, as far as I know bred in 1962. The
birds were kept inside in the winter in a rather small compartment,
approximately twelve by ten by eight feet high. In this small aviary the
birds started laying at the end of December, 1964, and two young were
hatched about 25th January and successfully raised. (I am sorry not
to be able to give exact dates as I would not disturb the birds.) As far
as I can determine the eggs are laid on alternate days and the hen pro-
bably sits from the second egg, so that the young accordingly hatch at
intervals. The period of incubation of the larger owls seems to be
thirty-three to thirty-six days. The Eagle-Owls obviously reach
maturity when two years old. In every case the nests have been
placed on the ground in a protected corner of the covered part
of the aviary. The nest has always been a rather flimsy affair
built of twigs in an open cardboard, or wooden, box or in an enclosed
part formed of stones. The cocks have been rather aggressive when the
hen is sitting, mainly in the small indoor aviary.
In 1955 I was successful in breeding five Little Owls (.Athene noctua ),
but in the following winter the old hen died, and I have not been
successful with that species since. (This breeding is described in detail
in the Magazine 1957, pages 44-5.) It seems much more difficult
to breed the smaller species of owls, and all my attempts with other
small species have been failures.
In 1959 we got a pair of Spotted Eagle-Owls, Bubo africanus , from
Regent's Park, where they were bred. This pair was very successful
and brought up two or three young every winter in an indoor aviary,
similar to that of the Kenya Eagle-Owls described above. When the
hen died there was a halt in breeding for a couple of years, but this
winter (1965) two hens were sitting on eggs in corners of the compart-
ment. Two young were successfully reared by one pair in spite of the
fact that there were in all six birds in the aviary. This autumn I had,
however, to separate the breeding pair, because they were chasing the
other inmates of the aviary. This was actually my first breeding of owls
to the second generation. (My first breeding of the species was described
in the Magazine, i960, pages 155-6.)

My greatest disappointment in breeding owls has been with the Great
Grey Owl (Strix nebulosa laponica), a species rarely seen in captivity.
Formerly our Zoo had had single specimens, but in 1962 we got four
young birds. They were still in nest feather, very dark grey, almost
black, but moulted out into adult plumage in the course of the summer.
When grown they were separated in, what I hoped to be, two pairs.
Already in the spring, 1963, eggs were dropped from the perch. This
was quite a surprise for me, as I had not expected such large owls
to lay eggs when not a year old. The following spring, 1964, nest-boxes
were erected in corners of the covered part of the aviary. The boxes
were approximately fifteen by fifteen inches and six inches high, the
bottom made of wire netting, covered with moss and twig. The boxes
were protected by pine twigs nailed to the sides. The nests were
accepted and in both compartments a bird sat on eggs, which un-
fortunately turned out to be clear. Only two and three eggs respectively
were laid. The same was the case in 1965, so my hopes for a first
breeding were abandoned for two seasons. Still I hope for better luck
next spring. Bird breeders have to be optimists.
With the beautiful Snowy Owl (.Nyctea scandiaca) we had no luck for
several years. Copenhagen Zoo has been successful with this owl for
many years, and very kindly let us have two young birds, which,
however, turned out to be two cocks. The Snowy Owl is one of the few
species of owls where sexes can easily be distinguished in adult
birds. The cock is practically pure white, the hen barred with grey on
the breast, back and wings, and so are the young birds too. The hen
also is a trifle larger than the cock. After several exchanges we got
a young bird in 1963 which really was a hen. The pair was kept in a
a compartment of our aviary for smaller birds of prey. The open
flight is twenty by seven feet, and eight feet high, the covered part
being seven by seven feet. In the inner compartment I erected a nest
in a corner, consisting of a low box with some twigs on the bottom.
This nest was, however, not accepted by the hen, who preferred to
deposit her eggs on the floor, in a rather thick layer of sand. We put
some flat stones around the nest, in order to keep the eggs together; this
manipulation was fortunately accepted by the hen. The first egg was
laid on 14th May, and six in all were laid at intervals of two to three
days. Five young hatched out. The hen obviously did not sit from the
first egg, because the first youngster was hatched on 30th June, two
following next day, and a further two some days later. The smallest had
disappeared at an early stage, obviously eaten by its parents or nest-
mates. The youngest one of the remaining four did not seem to thrive,
and was taken away and hand-reared. All the young, including the
youngest, thrived very well and are all together in a separate compart-
ment, the hand-reared one of course still being rather tame. As nestlings
they are covered with very dark, almost black down, and the juvenile

feathering is whitish grey, striped on the breast, like that of the old hen.
When this was written on 17th December, 1965, they had, however,
moulted out so far that three are considerably lighter on the breast
than the fourth, which is obviously a hen. In the meantime I have got
an adult wild-caught female, which I intend to pair with one of the
young cocks. This female is of European origin, and a trifle bigger
than the others, the parents of which came to Copenhagen Zoo from
Greenland. This may of course be a chance, as no local race is recog-
nized in spite of the large distribution of the species.
As to feeding, all the smaller species get white mice, rats, cavies and
rabbits and occasionally chickens' heads ; the larger ones are given
meat as a change of diet twice in the week. The birds seem to thrive
very well on this diet.

A COLLECTION OF PARROT FINCHES
By John J. Walsh (Drouin, Victoria, Australia)
My favourite birds are the Parrot Finches and I can say that I have
bred them all my life as I first started with them in 1929 at a very
youthful age, and they have held my love through the years with their
cheeky and lively behaviour.
I first started with the Red-headed Parrot Finch but I now have
three different species--Red-headed, Tricolour or Blue-headed, and
Fiji or Peale's. The Red-headed have bred well for me over the years,
but the last two seasons' result have been poor as the birds only made
nests and had clear eggs.
Blue-headed have been behaving better as each season they breed
and rear some young. I find them very good feeders and they seldom
fail to rear young once they are hatched.
Peale's are a fairly new species in this country and are probably the
rarest and most sought-after by aviculturists. They have appealing
ways and their colourful appearance makes them a true favourite.
I have thirteen of these little fellows at present and hope to build up
quite a stud of them before I release any to the public. They are rather
shy breeders and need a lot of attention in the form of live food and
seeding grasses. Plain cake is taken when young are in the nest and an
egg-food mixture which I use for Canaries is also relished. Plain
canary seed is possibly the main seed, with a little Jap millet and hemp
and hulled oats being taken sparingly. I have reared six young this
summer and the speed with which they become independent never
fails to amaze me. One hen which I have had for three seasons has not
reared a youngster yet, and another hen, the same age, has reared
about eighteen young to maturity during the same time. I have lost

Director, Berlin Zoological Garden (Germany)
Some interesting birds were acquired by the end of 1965. Among
other birds and mammals two White-backed Black Cockatoos
(Calyptorhynchus baudinii), a rare species in captivity, arrived from
Australia in exchange for zoo-bred animals, a welcome addition to
the pair of Yellow-eared Cockatoos ( Calyptorhynchus funereus) already
in the collection. Furthermore four Thick-billed Parrots ( Rhynchopsitta
pachyrhyncha ) arrived, considered one of the rarest parrots in captivity
which has been bred for the first time in the world at the San Diego Zoo
last year. The Berlin Zoo's collection of parrots now consists of sixty-
one different species.
A pair of White-backed Vultures was added to the birds of prey
collection, obtained in exchange for two zoo-bred Great Eagle-Owls.
Another Great Eagle-Owl hatched 1965 was donated to the " Deutscher
Naturschutzring," the German wildlife conservation organization,
which started in 1965 to reintroduce specimens of this endangered
species into forests in southern Germany. From the Nuremberg Zoo
we received a Booted Eagle ( Hieraaetus pennatus).
A fine specimen of Bronze-winged Duck (Anas specularis) was
imported from Chile in October. We are not sure if it is a male or a
female. Very little is known of the life habits of this interesting species,
rare in the wild and in captivity, and similar to the Mallards as well
as to the Shelducks in appearance and behaviour. Bronze-winged
Ducks were bred in captivity for the first time at the Wildfowl Trust
in 1964.
A young pair of Temminck's Tragopans (Tragopan temmincki) was
acquired in exchange for zoo-bred Green Peacocks and Ocellated
Turkeys. We have also a pair of Satyr Tragopans.

Captain Richard S. de Quincey (1896-1965)
There are very few left of my old bird friends to-day and the sudden
death of Captain de Quincey has once more thinned out their already
depleted numbers.
He had kept birds since extreme youth and I believe he was the
doyen of our Society, which he joined in 1913. He no doubt possessed
the best private collection of small, delicate birds existing at the present
time in England, and probably in the Old World. He always had
a very large number of Humming Birds and Sunbirds, and he kept
many small, unusual insectivorous and frugivorous species. His large
birds were few, but very interesting and beautiful ; the rarer forms of
Cotingas, Cuckoos, Motmots, Kingfishers, Touracos, and Trogons.
He also had some ducks and geese on a pond. Everything was beauti-
fully housed and cared for.
Dick de Quincey was a man of great taste and culture. His place
near Hereford, The Vern, was world famous for his herd of Hereford
and Short-horn cattle, considered the best in the world. But it was also
a beautiful home--the house was full of exquisite and valuable furniture
and paintings of the past centuries, and the gardens were excellent.
His numerous aviaries and greenhouses had been charmingly designed
and planted, and never overcrowded. He was a real master in the art
of keeping birds and growing plants, and also of displaying them.
I used to spend a few days with him every summer, and I shall
sadly miss my visits to The Vern, as no doubt will his other friends. His
departure is a great loss to aviculturists, and to all who care for beauty.

contained a reference to Rhynchopsitta terrisi. In The Condor (57, p. 305,
1955) J- W. Hardy and R. W. Dickerman consider that terrisi is separ-
able, but the relationship with pachyrhyncha is at the subspecific level.
Arrivals during December, 1965, and January, 1966, include two
species and one subspecies new to the collection. A pair of Fischer's
Starlings ( Spreo fischeri) represent a new species. They were presented
together with a pair of Chestnut Sparrows ( Passer --formerly Sorella --

Another new species is the Grey-backed Thrush {Turdus dissimilis

I have seen claims advanced for the Blackbird, Starling, even House

It is heartening to read in Australian Aviculture , 1965, p. 155, a report
by Ivor Gould of the very considerable success achieved by New
Zealand aviculturists in increasing the population of the New Zealand
Red-fronted (Kakariki) Parrakeet. Some seven or eight years ago a
census showed 103 of these birds then in captivity. Two years ago the
total had risen to 2,500.

John A. Fell, Gippsland, Victoria, reports that for him the 1964-65
breeding season was not particularly good. Nevertheless, quite a
number of birds were reared: Red-rumped Parrakeet, one ; Red-
rumped X Blue-bonnet, two ; Cockatiel, three ; Eastern Rosella,
three ; Adelaide Rosella, one ; Pale-headed Rosella, two ; Western
Rosella, one ; Blue-winged Grass Parrakeet, three ; Turquoisine,
ten ; Bourkes, four; Peach-faced Lovebird, fourteen; bush Budgerigar,
five ; Senegal Dove, three ; Crested Pigeon, one ; and a number of
Barbary Doves, including two mutations.

B. M. Killick writes : " I have just borrowed Seth-Smith's Parrakeets
and on looking at the plate showing a White-eared Gonure and a
Pearly I find that I have been keeping Pearlies and not White-eared,
as I thought, since 1962. I bred five youngsters in 1963, none in 1964,
but five again last year. Three of the 1963 birds are at Leeds Castle."
I do not think this Conure has been bred in recent years and Killick's
1963 success could very well rank as a " first ".

W. R. Carthew sends a further note on his Grey-necked Crowned
Cranes. He writes : "I must now advise you that the Crowned Cranes
hatched on 24th January, dz to a.m. Giving a period of twenty-
eight days incubation almost to the minute. As mentioned, the first
egg laid was infertile as I expected. The other two hatched under
exactly the same conditions as the previous hatching (hen standing
watching whilst chicks broke out of shell). Unfortunately the hen has
lost one of the chicks, but the other is doing fine."

Dr. Jean Delacour (1965, p. 188) mentions a brief visit to the amazing
collection of the brothers Callegari, near Ravenna. I have recently
heard from Eugenio Callegari that their Acorn Woodpeckers,
Melanerpes formicivorus, twice reared young last year. At the end of July
one young one was reared; and in the middle of September two of three
hatched.
Oliver L. Austin, Birds of The World , p. 193, says : " . . . the Acorn
Woodpecker, is a provident species that stores food for future use. It
drills holes just the right size in the bark and sticks acorns in them to
eat when times are leaner. Tree trunks are often riddled with its empty
storage holes."

Dr. L. A. Swaenepoel writes : " I was lucky enough, or should I say
unlucky enough (for, as the late Duke of Bedford once said, the price
was heroic) to obtain from a dealer a female albino African Grey
Parrot. She was a lovely bird, definitely masculine in appearance
owing to a huge beak. Wholly white with a brilliant red tail and
de-coloured beak and feet. The eyes were brilliant pinkish-red.
This unique bird died two days later, despite our every care. The
post-mortem examination showed severe alterations of liver and
kidneys, very much resembling ' infectious hepatitis ', but though
many examinations and cultures were made no vibrionic germs could
be detected. There was also a severe haemorrhagic enteritis."

Walther Langberg, Copenhagen, sends his breeding results, 1965.
Crimson-winged, three pairs reared a total of ten young ; Splendid
Grass Parrakeet, five pairs reared about twenty-five young ; Blue-
winged, one ; Bourkes and Turquoisine did well. The old pair of
Grey Parrots that bred for the first time in 1956 and have had young
ones many times since, reared three young. Many young Bicheno's
Finches and Peak's Parrot Finches were reared ; and at the time of
the report two pairs of Painted Finches had young in the nest.
Walther Langberg writes of his Turquoisines : "A normal pair
reared two dilute young ones. There were four in the nest and when
I went to ring them at about a week old I noticed that two had red
eyes and two normal dark eyes. When they left the nest the two dilute
youngsters, a male and a female, were paler than usual. Their eyes
were then dark. The other two young ones were quite normal in
colour. A later clutch gave three young, all females and all normal."

Paul Schneider, California, reports : " The 1965 breeding season
was a fair one for me. Twelve Cuban Blue-headed Quail Doves were
reared by two pairs. Their basic diet has been 20 per cent protein
chicken feed in pellet form. Also reared were a pair of Satyr Tragopans,
a pair of Impeyans, and nine Green Jungle Fowl. Amongst the
parrakeets were three lutino Ring-necked and one blue ; the latter
was lost after five months due, I suspect, to cat trouble ; four yellow
Red-rumped, three males and one female ; five Many-coloured and
six Bourkes were also reared. Five Rock Peplars, four in one nest,
proved to be males. The lone female was from a 1964 female and an
older male. This male was from a pair of birds I sold four years ago
to a friend. The pair always had infertile eggs. I swapped my friend
males and he produced for me with a year old hen ; his pair also

produced. So, I guess that just because you have a true pair it does not
necessarily mean they will reproduce."

A. Rutgers. Edited by K. Norris. Blandford Press, Ltd., London,
1965. Price Vol. 1 185., Vol. 2 195. 6 d.
The first of these two volumes deals with pheasants and other galli-
formes, pigeons, waterfowl, and parrots, including the Budgerigar ; the
second with the passerines. All the species usually obtainable (and
many that are not) are dealt with and in both volumes the majority of
species are illustrated with coloured photographs. A few give a faulty
idea of what they are like (e.g. the nearly white Red-eared Waxbills on
plate 22) and some are of birds in rather poor plumage state but in
most are good.
Each volume begins with chapters on general topics--housing,
feeding, etc., and then deals separately with each species. In many cases
two races of a species are dealt with under separate headings, which may
be useful if, as is sometimes claimed, one is easier to keep than the other.
Much of the information and advice given is sound but I was perturbed
by sometimes coming on statements which, like the clock that struck
thirteen, were not only intrinsically wrong but cast doubt on all that had
gone before. Finding a few statements that I know to be incorrect made
me, perhaps unjustly, suspect the accuracy of many that I did not know
to be right. Throughout the book the terms " variety 55 and " species 55
are used as though they were synonymous and the different races of,
for example, the Avadavat, are referred to as " species 55 although their
correct (racial) status is indicated in the scientific names given. It
occurred to me that some of the lapses could perhaps have been due to
mistranslation or faulty " telescoping 33 of the original German. I have
not, however, had the opportunity to compare the English and German
editions.
In spite of the above flaws the books can be warmly recommended.
I particularly liked the general tone and spirit of the introductory
chapters. In these the author's humanity and love of birds is very
apparent and, unlike so many writers on bird keeping, he clearly shows
that most birds cannot be kept successfully unless one is willing to
devote a good deal of time and care to them.

A CRANE WITH A FALSE LEG
I remember the late Sir David Ezra's Crowned Cranes in Calcutta very well and
wonder what eventually happened to the young one. One of the parent birds, either
just before or just after hatching, twisted its foot and was very lame and we thought
an amputation might be necessary. Sir David was very interested as I had a Sams
Crane reared from a chick which broke a leg below the knee. I amputated and made
a series of wooden bamboo legs for him tipped with a rubber knob. After wearing the
leg for about nine or ten years he was attacked by dogs or jackals in my garden and had
his wing broken on the same side as his wooden leg. I again amputated but this was
too much as he was unbalanced now. He walked in a straight line with ease but
anything more complicated resulted in collapse and he lay there until I put him
upright again. This sight became too heartbreaking to endure so I destroyed him.
He was incredibly tame all his life but dangerous with strangers whom he recognized
instantly. He was very fond of my Oorah bearer and stood guard all night outside his
godown (quarters) and attacked anyone who tried to get too near the door. His clarion
calls, particularly in the monsoon, in the early mornings annoyed my neighbours who,
however, always liked to see old peg leg dancing and throwing up a hibiscus twig with
a flower at the end.

I saw this species regularly I think it was in Benin, when I was a forest officer there.
I offered rewards for nests to the local lads of the village without results. As Mr.
Harrison remarks, the cocks when not feeding seemed to spend an enormous time
jumping up and down with a blade of grass or feather in their bills, presumably for
courtship practice or exercise as they were at it most of the year. The peculiar noises
they made were as Harrison describes and like most of the waxbills an enormous
amount of effort seemed to be expended in " singing " with negligible results.

Could Not Some " Newcomers " to the Trade be Inspected ?
For the last 45 years I have always been interested in the way that bird dealers keep
their birds. A few weeks ago, however, I received a bird which was unable to fly as all
primaries had been cut off very short. It had bird excreta on its back which could
not have happened in transit, it was very lame in one leg, both nostrils were closed, and
one eye was damaged in the lid. The bird was miserably dishevelled yet refused to
take a bath or preen during the two days it survived. Its tongue too protruded and
could not be withdrawn. The point is that this bird should never have been put on
rail ; the sender must have known its chances of survival were odds against.
I have found also that the correct identification of some of the dealers' wares is shaky.
I saw advertised (Chloropsis aurifrons) the Golden-fronted Fruitsucker and received
(C. icterocephala chlorocephala ) the Burmese form which is quite different. Again a hen
Jerdon's turned out to be Hardwick's. Both these, however, were in good order on
arrival.
It is the condition and treatment of weak birds in the shops to which I wish to
draw attention. Gould not " newcomers " to the trade be inspected periodically or
given a trial period or an " L " licence before receiving a full trade licence ?

THE ARCTIC THREE-TOED WOODPECKER
(Picoides arcticus )
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.990898451612903" page_id="56366320"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
By D. M. Reid-Henry (Woodford, London, England)
This species is in size similar to the European Great Spotted Wood-
pecker, Dendrocopus major , but in appearance and habit is very different.
Moreover, it is a bird which prefers coniferous forest to a great extent,
and therefore is to be found as quite common in the vast areas of pine
and larch stands in the northern and western areas of the North
American continent.
There is another species of the three-toed woodpecker in North
America which, although more scarce, claims the name P. tridactylus.
This latter is also to be found through northern Asia and Europe.
They are superficially similar, but may easily be distinguished by the
colour of the back which, as may be seen from the accompanying
coloured plate of P. arcticus , is all glossy black. P. tridactylus has a white,
or a barred black-and-white back taking the form of a central pale
streak.
There are comparatively few male woodpeckers in the world which
entirely lack crimson markings, particularly on the head ; and this
lack of red in the males of these two species makes them quite distinct
from any other American woodpecker. The strong bars of black on the
flanks of both sexes in each case is a further, perhaps even more useful
point of separation from other species.
The feeding habits of the three-toed woodpeckers differ from those
of others of the family in that they prefer to use their bills to lever off
pieces of rotten bark rather than to break directly into the wood by
hammering. They work with great industry and will strip a bough of
its bark in an astonishingly short time. If the tree should quickly
prove to be not dead enough for the stripping to be easy, they move on
and continue their efforts more productively elsewhere. As a result of
this behaviour it is an easy matter to trace the presence of the bird in
an area from the amount of freshly stripped bark lying around the base
of the trees.

70 D. M. REID-HENRY-THE ARCTIC THREE-TOED WOODPECKER
The nesting of this bird is little different from the general practice
amongst woodpeckers, but it is interesting to see in Richard Pough's
account (Audubon Bird Guide) that the hole is often drilled low down in
the tree or post used. Two to fifteen feet is the height he gives, and one
is forced to wonder how any hole so near to the ground can possibly
escape attention from undesirable visitors.
The absence of the small hind toe of these birds leads one to conjec-
ture about the worth of a hind toe to a woodpecker. It does not serve
as a prop, as I have noticed when studying wild and captive birds ;
the tail takes over that function. It is weak ; and when the bird is
climbing, the three useful toes are used in the main to hang from,
whilst the hind toe is often twisted round to appear outside the tarsus
rather than inside, as it would tend to be if it were being used with
any strength.
I have noticed this in the cases of three captive birds of differing
genera and in every case where the Great Spotted Woodpecker is
concerned, whether wild or captive.
A possible conclusion is that this hind toe is in point of fact now
redundant for many woodpeckers and that the three-toed species have
had the sense to dispense with the encumbrance. It remains to be seen
in the future generations whether other species will also become
" three-toed " as a result of the process of evolution.

(Deroptyus accipitrinus)
By Ralph C. Small (Parrot Keeper, Chicago Zoological Park, U.S.A.)
We received a pair of Hawk-headed Parrots in April, 1961. These
were young birds, tame and talking, but the female was not quite as
tame as the male. They were kept inside for about seven months of the
year and in outside flights during the warmer months. The pair
started to pluck their feathers a few months after arrival, but when
nesting started, they stopped plucking. After they finished the third
nest, they started plucking again. While they were incubating and
while young were in the nest they were so mean they forgot all about
plucking. Since the nest-box was removed and the last baby, they have
tamed down again. However, I have not heard them talking.
The inside temperature of the building was kept at 75 0 during colder
weather, but would go to ioo* or a little more on the hottest summer
days.
The cage was 5 by 5 by 7 feet high. Tree branches were inside for
perches. The nest-box was 11 inches high by 12 inches wide and
24 inches long with a 3! inch entrance hole. The box was hung at about
30 degrees angle and about 4 to 5 inches of tan bark was used for filler.
They kicked most of this out before nesting started.
While the young were in nest they ate a lot of roasted peanuts and
huge quantities of fruit and especially liked raw carrots and some raw
heart.
It seems in this pair that the feather plucking was due to boredom
more than any other reason. So with this pair family life seems to have
agreed with them.
Grain Fed .--Four parts large white millet : 4 parts canary seed ;
1 part sunflower ; J part raw peanuts (hulled). Approximately six
roasted peanuts per day.
Fruit given daily .--Escarole ; carrots ; apples ; oranges ; bananas ;
grapes ; soaked raisins. All of this sprinkled with Di-calcium and a
vitamin mineral supplement.
The daily water supply contained 0.06 cc. to a pint of water of
Vi-Syneral and a pinch of Di-calcium, mixed well.

Not breeding as often. Spending more time in box. Seems like
they have kicked most of the tan bark out of the box.
Believe sitting--23 days after first good breeding.
Female sits in box most of the time. Comes off 5 to 10 minutes
to eat and male fights with her till she returns to nest.
Both parents are very mean.
One or more babies about 2 weeks old. Male got out and
attacked male Red and Yellow Macaw. Checked box.
Looks like getting ready to breed again.
Baby in front of hole for the first time. Believe 49 days old.

PROFESSOR CARL NAETHER-A CONGREGATION OF SOFTBILLS 73
ENJOYING A DIVERSIFIED CONGREGATION
OF SOFTBILLS

By Professor Carl Naether (Encino, Calfornia, U.S.A.)
Why is it that our otherwise so informative magazine brings us so
very few reports of members maintaining mixed collections of softbills ?
In all probability, there are many more members keeping such collections
than members attempting seriously to breed certain foreign softbills in
their aviaries. Keeping a diversified group of insect- and fruit-eaters
can yield a good deal of worth-while information on their habits as well
as much personal satisfaction and enjoyment gained from watching
a selected group of miscellaneous birds thrive in an atmosphere of amity
and well-being.
I know this to be true, because I have for the past twenty-five years
or so indulged in reserving a portion of my aviary for just such a group
of softbills--wholly for the purpose of observing and of enjoying them
day in and day out, and not for breeding them, as I do various species
of more or less rare foreign doves and pigeons. In my experience it has
been, and it is still, quite remarkable what a truly wide variety of
softbills can be kept together the whole year through in peace and
harmony. But let me be specific : in an aviary, 8 feet high, 8 feet wide,
and 16 feet deep, twenty-five birds belonging to nearly as many species,
keep friendly, if at times spirited, company with one another. They are
absolutely safe from the usual enemies that trouble avian birds so
commonly--and unnecessarily. A solid roof over the entire enclosure
keeps inimical nocturnal visitors, such as cats, opposums, owls, et al.,
away. The wire-netting covering the front and one of the sides of the
aviary is of such small mesh as to prevent even young mice, snakes, and
lizards from gaining entrance, or cats and squirrels from penetrating
it with their sharp, long claws. Moreover, a concrete foundation sunk
16 inches into the ground safeguards the aviary occupants from any
and all burrowing animals, particularly rats. Finally, an almost ever-
blooming lantana hedge extends around the outside bottom front of
the aviary to a height of 3 feet, thus effectively keeping cats and
other marauders from seeing the birds within the aviary, instead of
tempting them to jump up, even to crawl up, on the wire-netting.
In the seven years during which this bird enclosure has been in constant
service, neither injury to, nor loss of birds due to interference from
outside enemies has been the case. That net result, so beneficial to my
birds in keeping them wholly out of harm's way, has, needless to
emphasize, been a distinct satisfaction to me, for it has always been my
contention that the first and foremost responsibility of any keeper of
live birds is to provide for their complete safety and security both day
and night. Being not harassed at any time, my twenty-five softbills

are a contented, if not indeed a happy lot. Widely varying in size and
in colour, as well as in individual behaviour, most of them are alert and
active during the greater part of the day--flying about to their hearts'
content, bathing on the leaves of evergreen plants or in the water-pans,
and, of course, patronizing feeders and drinkers innumerable times
daily.
And what a cosmopolitan assemblage it happens to be ! Diminutive
Yuhinas, a true pair of nigrimentum and one of flavicollis, imported from
India seven years ago, the first mentioned coming fearlessly to me at
feeding time to " serenade " me with their soft, sweet song, always eager
for the first bit of sweet grape or the first tiny mealworm offered. Ever
alert, black headcrests raised in the excitement, plumage soft and glossy,
the pair flits from plant to plant, male and female in continual
" singing " communication and contact with each other. Somewhat
similarly behaved, but much larger, stronger, and bolder birds are the
colourful Silver-eared Mesias. Unusually swift and dexterous flyers,
they will pounce on a mealworm tossed amidst shrubs in a second's
time, their wild, penetrating cries ringing in the air. Assuredly, they
are among the most fearless members of the group, and perhaps also
the most active--or restless. Apparently a true pair, they may be seen
together most of the time ; they even built a nest of sorts in the shrub-
bery last year, lining it partially with bits from a paper towel. Also
always on the go is a White-capped Redstart, he with the ever-whipping,
blood-red tail and the jet-black, velvety plumage, topped by the
snow-white cap. His song is a meagre gurgling of mixed sounds, low
and not especially euphonious. But what this Indian bird lacks in
musical accompliments, he makes up in feathery beauty. Moreover, he
is one of the most curious tenants of the aviary, flying to the feed table
the moment I am about to get things ready, there to eye me and my
doings fixedly until I leave. A husky chap, this Redstart gets along
splendidly with his fellow occupants, even with those boasting a some-
what similarly coloured plumage. Among certain softbills I keep, such
as various Solitaires, there is a strong tendency not to tolerate birds of
like or similar colour, even though of entirely different species, but to
pursue them relentlessly ; hence I keep the Solitaires separately--with
some doves. Of course, I keep a number of Pekin Robins in the
collection--those rather colourful and tuneful clowns that enliven any
feathered congregation.
Among larger softbills which I enjoy watching a Scimitar Babbler
stands out--he with the very long, sickle-shaped bill, by means of which
he digs and digs--in the feed dishes' contents as well as in the soil--an
exceedingly nimble jumper from branch to branch and also an elusive
aviary occupant, usually hiding in the shrubbery, whence now and then
he emits his loud, shrill cries. Likewise fairly large, of thrush size, is a
yellow-legged Blackbird from South America, my first one of this

species. Now quite tame and friendly, he has yet to prove his ability as
a songster--my reason for getting and keeping him.
To lend conspicuous colour, as well as a tropical atmosphere, to my
congregation of long-lived feathered friends, I keep some varieties of
Honey-creepers--their shining blue-black patterns vieing strongly with
the predominantly brown patterns of most of the other aviary birds.
Honey-creepers, I have found, are quite durable and easily cared for.
Their daily diet consists of sponge-cake in honey water, fruit flies and
small mealworms ; and, of course, sweet, ripe fruits of different sorts,
both summer and winter. Diminutive White Eyes thrive on the same
diet. Lively decorative effects in the aviary are further provided by
Mrs. Wilson's Tanagers, Red-rump Tanagers, as well as several Orioles,
whose bright yellow-and-black plumage helps to " light up " the entire
avian assembly. Finally, I must not neglect to mention a number of the
Japanese Brown Titmice--the clowns of the collection that enliven the
whole atmosphere with their amusing antics, of which, seemingly, they
never tire. Most agreeable busybodies, they are also very curious and
very tame--a delight to keep and to observe.
Since the twenty-five birds occupying my aviary have lived and
thrived in congenial co-existence now for many years and without
being in the least crowded, it would be unwise to add to their number,
for to crowd too many birds into limited space subjects them to almost
constant harassment--puts them inevitably on the defensive all day
long, thus preventing them from revealing their true natural behaviour
--and, of course, from being at all happy and contented. If in past
years I felt that I had to introduce a new bird to the group, then
I placed him in a cage, which I set in the aviary, so that he might
acquaint himself gradually with his new environment and especially
with its tenants, thus becoming used to them, and they to him. Even
following his release from the cage, he would bear watching for several
days, for birds are territorially-minded even in captivity, each favouring
certain perches and other preferred locations within the aviary, where
rivals are not at all welcome.
All in all, my feathered flock of softbills affords me daily hours of
welcome relaxation and genuine pleasure. I never tire of being in-
trigued--and entranced--by their comings and goings, their more or
less natural, instinctive conduct in captive, pleasant surroundings,
which enables me to know them better and better. How eagerly and
how generously they " reimburse 55 me for the care I am privileged to
give them day in and day out year after year !

(.Aphelocoma coerulescens californica )
By W. R. Partridge (Lower Haselor, Evesham, Worcestershire)
Not many birds come to this country from North America these days,
so I was fortunate to obtain a pair of Californian Scrub Jays ( Aphelo-
coma coerulescens californica ) from Mr. Alan Griffiths, who had two pairs
in the spring of 1964. The pair he retained for himself nested and
hatched one youngster, which was lost when about a week old.
The Scrub Jay has a wide distribution across the southern United
States, from California in the west to Florida in the east, being repre-
sented by several sub-species.
On receiving my pair they were put straight out into a planted
aviary 22 by 8 feet, with inside shelter 10 by 8 feet. A pair of Bob-White
Quail, which already occupied the aviary, were left in it, and they and
the Jays lived peacefully together for a considerable time, until the
Jays started to go to nest, when the Quail were both killed by the Jays
on the same day.
It was late in April when the Jays started to construct a nest of twigs
in a snowberry bush, about 4 feet from the ground in the thickest part
of the bush. The hen started sitting about two weeks after nest con-
struction, and was not seen off the nest again for about three weeks,
when she was again seen in the flight. On inspection, the nest was
empty. Although no eggs were found, I have to assume by the length
of time the hen was sitting, that some must have been laid, and
subsequently eaten. The pair were left in the aviary until early in
December, when the hen was seen to have a swelling on her foot and
was brought into the bird room and treated, and in March when again
able to perch normally, she was returned to the aviary. In the middle
of April, 1965, the birds were again found to be carrying twigs from the
snowberry bush in the flight, into the shelter. The place they chose to
build the nest was on a wire platform, inside the shelter, which had
originally been used by doves, now removed from this aviary. The
nest was made entirely of twigs, and although they had been given an
abundance of fine roots, they made no use of them for lining the nest as
most jays do.
The hen started sitting on 25th April, and was not seen off the nest
until 5th May, when the nest was found to contain seven eggs. She
was a very tight sitter and never left the nest, even when food was
given, although one had to pass within about 2 feet of the nest in the
shelter. The next time she was seen off the nest was on 21st May, and
it was then found to contain one young bird, three or four days old,
and six unhatched eggs. From this stage onwards, she left the nest

each time anyone passed through the shelter. No more eggs were
hatched.
At first the youngster seemed to grow very slowly, and was very
little larger after a week than when it was first seen, but from this
stage it grew rapidly, and first left the nest on iith June. This was
a little premature, and it was replaced, and remained in the nest for
almost another week. It then spent the next ten days on the floor of
the shelter and on low perches, before it found its way out of the
entrance hole which was 5 feet above the ground, into the outside
flight. From this stage it rapidly gained strength in its wings, and
was soon flying as well as its parents.
When it first emerged, the youngster was overall a pale lightish
brown, lighter towards the abdomen, with light blue wings and tail.
After some weeks it gradually attained a blue head and neck, and
white streaks on the throat, as in the adult. By mid-September it was
practically indistinguishable from its parents, except that the blue
of the parents was perhaps a little brighter.
These Jays were fed on a basic diet of a proprietary softbill food,
moistened Saval No. 1 puppy meal, with minced meat and soft sweet
apple each day. They were also given maggots and mealworms, and
after the hen started sitting they were given as many as they would eat.
A description of the above birds is as follows : The sexes are alike in
colouring, but the cock has a bolder head than the hen. Head, back
of neck, wings, rump and tail blue, throat and chest white streaked
bluish grey. Back greyish brown, and the underparts are a pale
brownish grey. There is a white stripe above and behind the eye, and
a darker shade of blue on the cheeks. The adults are about 12 inches
in length.
The young bird reared is believed to be a female.
Additional Mote, 13th May , 1966 .--The pair of Scrub Jays have again
selected the same place to nest and have a youngster about a fortnight
old.
As described, W. R. Partridge has bred the Californian Scrub Jay
(.Aphelocoma coerulescens californica). It is believed that this may be a
first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this
species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communi-
cate at once with the Hon. Secretary.

78 EUGENIO CALLEGARI-BREEDING OF THE ACORN WOODPECKER
BREEDING OF THE ACORN WOODPECKER

By Eugenio Callegari (Ravenna, Italy)
About three years ago I bought a pair of Acorn Woodpeckers. After
a short time of observation I housed them in an aviary together with
three more woodpeckers, two Golden-backed and a Scaly-bellied. The
newcomers in the cage tolerated their companions perfectly well and
never tried to attack them, but when about a year later I housed in the
same cage a Yellow-fronted Woodpecker, they attacked it furiously so
that I was forced to take it out quickly to prevent them from killing it.
In July, 1964, I put four Great Spotted Woodpeckers into a neigh-
bouring aviary and for over two months the cock made continuous
attempts to attack the new woodpeckers whenever they alighted on
the partition between the two cages. Early in the spring of 1965, the
Scaly-bellied Woodpecker died of an illness and shortly after the
Acorn Woodpeckers killed the two Golden-backed which they had
tolerated up to that time. They perched on two trunks dug into the soil,
which were both eaten out by their pecking activity, but the base of
one of them afforded a nesting hole. One day I noticed a hole dug in
the ground and the man in charge of the birds assured me that the
hole had been dug by the birds and that they used to dig such holes
which he filled in again.
As I had never heard of these birds nesting in captivity I was
far from suspecting they were just about to breed. At that time
I left on a trip to Lapland and on my return, exactly on 6th
August, the man informed me that he had one day noticed a fully-
fledged little bird. He had moreover found their nest dug at the base
of one of the trunks about 20 cm. from the ground on the more hidden
side of it, so that it could be spotted only after careful inspection.
While cleaning the place, the man in charge of the birds had never
found dead fledglings, which leads me to think that the brood consisted
of one. Two days after I realized that though still feeding their young,
they were engaged in brooding again. It was not easy to watch because
whenever one tried to get near the cage the non-brooding woodpecker
would utter a warning scream so that the brooding one left off brooding
and both pretended they were unengaged. After a time, however, the
peeping of the young was heard. From the sound it was easy to guess
there was more than one, so I hurriedly separated the fledgling of the
previous brood lest they might kill it. A few days later a still blind
fledgling was found dead on the ground. Later on, two more emerged,
so I gathered that the second brood consisted of three fledglings, one
of which was dead. The three fledglings now enjoy perfect health and
they live separated from their parents ; they are three hens. What
most amazes me is that a woodpecker has bred twice in the same
season.

(Colius indicus)
By Dr. Herbert Schifter (Vienna, Austria)
Mousebirds are only rarely kept by aviculturists and even in zoos
they are unusual inhabitants of the bird houses, but they are very
remarkable birds with strange habits and anatomical peculiarities.
The six species of Mousebirds form a group of their own ( Coliidae ) and
they are not closely related to any other birds. All species are distri-
buted in Africa south of the Sahara desert and live in small flocks
of usually from five to twenty birds. They are about the size of a
Starling but have very long tails measuring up to 250 mm. Mousebirds
are excellent climbers and their feet are highly adapted to be used in
this way. There are two groups of Mousebirds which differ in a striking
way ; therefore they are sometimes arranged in two genera ( Colius and
Urocolius) but more often the two groups are only given subgeneric
rank. I think--especially basing on my studies of the development of
the fledgelings--there are enough differences to separate Urocolius
from Colius.
The two species of Urocolius are characterized by red bills which are
black only at the tip and by red " spectacles ", bare skin around the
eyes. They also have a metallic bluish or greenish tinge on their
feathers and a very long, pointed tail. The two species of the subgenus
(or genus) Urocolius are the Red-faced Mousebird ( Colius indicus) and
the Blue-naped Mousebird ( Colius macrourus). The Red-faced
Mousebird which in German is often called " Spectacled Mousebird "
comes from the Southern third of Africa, while the similar, but smaller,
Blue-naped Mousebird which is characterized by a blue patch on the
neck is distributed north of the Congo basin from Senegal to Kenya
and Tanzania. There are some geographical races of both species
differing in the colour of the front, the throat, and the belly. The best
known species of the second group is the Speckled Mousebird ( Colius
striatus) which has a very wide distribution from South Africa to
Abyssinia and Nigeria. The remaining three species are the White-
backed Mousebird ( Colius colius) from South Africa, the Red-backed
Mousebird ( Colius castanotus) from Angola, and the White-headed
Mousebird ( Colius leucocephalus) from Kenya and Tanzania.
In spite of the fact that mousebirds have been imported to Europe
as long ago as the seventies and eighties of the 19th century, only a few
records of successful breeding of these birds exist. The first species to
be bred seems to be the Speckled Mousebird ( Colius striatus) . According
to a note by Mr. Prestwich in Foreign Birds , Vol. 24 (1958), p. 280, this
species was bred in England in 1912 and 1914 ; other records of
breeding the Speckled Mousebird are to be found in the German
journal Gejiederte Welt , 1938, pp. 413-5, in Foreign Birds , 1958,

pp. 246-7 (Report of Mrs. D. K. Draper on breeding the Natal
Striped Coly), and in i960 again in the Gejiederte Welt (A. V. Nielsen
on breeding Colius striatus in Denmark). Since 19623 Speckled Colies
have also been bred at the Zoo of San Diego, California, U.S.A.
(Kenton C. Lint, International Zoo Yearbook, Vol. IV, pp. 94-5). So the
Speckled Mousebird is the species whose breeding biology is best
known of all members of the family. There seem to be no significant
differences between the various subspecies of Colius striatus.
On the contrary the Blue-naped Mousebird ( Colius macrourus) does
not seem to have been bred before 1955 when Dr. Bieler reported the
hatching and rearing of a young bird of this species in his aviaries (see
Gejiederte Welt, 1955, pp. 181-2). On successfully breeding the Red-
faced Mousebird ( Colius indicus) I have not been able to find a previous
breeding record on the continent, and Mr. Prestwich and Mr. Yealland
have informed me that they do not know of any successful breeding in
Great Britain. So it may be that the breeding of this handsome species
is a first, at least in Austria and Germany. But I would like very much
to hear of any previous breeding and other experiences with different
kinds of mousebirds because I am very anxious to have further informa-
tion even on the not so well-known species.
Because the mousebirds are not often imported it was not easy to get
specimens of different species of this family ; but when I started my
studies in 1961 I was so lucky to receive specimens of three species.
The first ones I got were the Red-faced Mousebirds about which
I record here ; the two other species which I could acquire and also
successfully breed, beginning in 1962, were the Blue-naped and the
Speckled Mousebird. Now after experiences of five years I can also
record the breeding of specimens which had been reared in my aviaries ;
and now at last I have got nice and tame pets by taking some young
out of the nests before they flew.
But at first my Red-faced Mousebirds were very shy though they were
in excellent condition. I housed them in an indoor aviary measuring
nearly 10 feet in length and 6 feet in width, and about 8 feet high. In
this aviary the colies were kept by themselves. The specimens of the
other two species I housed in similar aviaries. In 1961 I could not
observe any pair formation or display behaviour but the birds did
well and even became accustomed to captivity and human approach,
but were still frightened when I had to enter the aviary. From the
eight specimens of the Red-faced Mousebird which I received in 1961
I transferred two birds to the Vienna Zoo of Schonbrunn where they
had also some experience of keeping colies, one specimen of Colius
indicus having lived there for more than four years. Another of my
birds died from an injury through which it had lost one leg. The
remaining five birds proved to be two pairs and a single male which
lived peacefully together with the breeding pairs.

The first breeding attempts I observed in the spring of 1962 when
I had kept the birds for already a whole year, but the first successful
hatching of a young bird occurred only in June, 1962. Already some
months before I had placed some baskets in the aviary woven from
" Peddigrohr " which is very good for making baskets for waxbills and
other birds. In the wild Mousebirds breed in a thorn tree, generally in
the thickest forest, where they build their nests which are shallow cups
or mere platforms of sticks and rootlets. In the indoor aviaries I could
not provide them with such nesting sites, but I was very happy to see
that they used the baskets I had fixed in the aviary. The birds took
small twigs and grass into these baskets and lined the nests with some
green leaves. Before fixing the baskets I had observed where the birds
had tried to deposit dry and green leaves of lettuce, small twigs, and
other nesting materials. Then when I fixed the baskets at these places
the birds seemed to be very pleased to be able to build their nests in the
baskets. In the following years they often bred two, or even three, times
in the same nest, but sometimes they also changed from one basket to
another. From time to time I had to take out the baskets to clean them
because the mousebirds did not keep them clean. In 1964 when young
pairs of mousebirds were breeding too I fixed more baskets in the
aviary ; from this time I had always five or six baskets in the aviary.
The first breeding in June, 1962, was a very exciting event. The
birds were extremely timid and left the nest as soon as I approached
the aviary. So I did not dare to control the nest regularly, but a fort-
night after they had begun to breed I first discovered a little naked
fledgeling in the nest. One of the old birds always stayed in the nest
with the young so that I could not see anything of it until 16th July,
when the young looked out of the basket. It was well feathered and was
already looking like a mousebird but was much smaller than the adult
birds. Only two days later the young mousebird left the nest for the
first time but it was not able to return to the basket. Though it made
some attempts to fly, it always fell down to the ground where I finally
picked it up and put it back in the nest. But something was wrong
with this first mousebird because it became weaker and weaker during
the following days and finally died about four weeks old on 29th July.
Through this failure (I think there was a lack of vitamins which I could
prevent in the following breeding attempts) I was very discouraged,
but the breeding pair did not mind at all.
Only three weeks later, in August, 1962, they began to breed again
in another basket which I had fixed on a higher branch where the
birds were not so easily disturbed as in their first low nesting site.
As in the first case only one young mousebird hatched, but this time
the fledgeling seemed to develop much better and soon it looked out of
the basket beside the old bird which always stayed with it in the nest.
On 17th September, the young left the nest for the first time ; it

could now already fly though it was only half the size of the adult birds
and had very short wings. Wherever it went it was always accompanied
by one of the parents, or by both, and it was never left alone for the
next few days. It already looked like a mousebird though it had only
a short tail and small crown feathers which it erected when I
approached the aviary and the parents became excited. It was very
interesting to observe the young during the following weeks, but it
grew quickly and after another four weeks it had reached full size.
Now it was distinguishable from the adult birds only by its yellowish-
green bill, its dark, bluish " spectacles " and the dark feet. After
leaving the nest the young was fed for about a month but it stayed
with its parents even after this time and accompanied them too when
they had begun to breed again at the end of October, 1962.
During this breeding the birds were disturbed by the other breed-
ing pair and left the eggs after only half the incubation period. But in
1963 they bred six times and reared eight young. The adult birds
were now not so timid as in the previous year so that I could dare to
control the nests regularly to determine the incubation period, which is
extremely short only lasting about twelve days. I was also able to
observe the development of the fledgelings which hatch as tiny naked
creatures with their eyes still closed weighing not more than about 2 g.
I could also weigh and measure them regularly ; for this procedure I had
to take them out of the nests, but I always was anxious to put them back
as quick as possible. I then was very pleased when the parents soon
returned to the nest and their young ; at least the birds became so
used to the daily procedure that I had nearly no losses. I could also
take photographs of the development of the young mousebirds (see
plate).
My second pair of the Red-faced Mousebird too nested for the first
time successfully in 1962, but after some attempts it was not before
December that they reared their first young ; but already this time
three young hatched, a rare event as Red-eyed Mousebirds usually
have a clutch of two eggs. Unluckily one young died just after leaving
the nest for the first time ; but the other two young were successfully
reared. In 1963, this pair bred again too, but in March only a single
young was reared. In July two young hatched but none was reared ;
and a few days after this event I observed that the male of the second
pair was replaced by the single male which had always lived in the
aviary together with the breeding pairs and their young. In 1963,
the newly formed pair bred only once and reared two young, but in
the following year this pair was as successful as the other pair rearing a
number of young colies.
The replaced male then lived peacefully together with the other
birds until 1965, when it was growing older and had difficulties in
flying and climbing because it had lost some of its claws. I then

DR. H. SGHIFTER-BREEDING OF RED-FACED MOUSEBIRDS 83
separated this old bird but to-day it is still living as do three other
specimens of the Red-faced Mousebirds received five years ago in 1961.
Only one of the imported birds has recently died after nearly four years
and ten months in my aviaries. The remaining birds at least have
reached an age of about six years ; and the " old " male may even be
older.
In 1964, not only my old pairs of Colius indicus bred successfully, but
also a pair of young birds reared in my aviaries in the previous year
continued the success of their parents ; the first breeding attempts were
already made in autumn 1963, but it was not before July, 1964, that
young second-generation mousebirds of this species hatched. The young
pair bred in the same aviary as the old pairs in which the birds lived
since 1961. Though I had meanwhile transferred some of the young
Red-faced Mousebirds to the Zoo of Schonbrunn (Vienna) and to
another zoo, there were always between ten and twelve specimens
living in the same aviary. Surprisingly enough there were no quarrels
between the different pairs ; and only occasionally young birds were
persecuted when they approached the nest of another pair. But
even more often I have seen young mousebirds sitting in the nests of
another pair beside the breeding bird. Up to date nearly forty specimens
of the Red-eyed Mousebirds have been reared ; and also I have taken
a number of embryos out of the eggs during various stages of develop-
ment for further studies.
After five years of keeping mousebirds I would like to say that these
birds are very satisfying inhabitants of bird houses if their requirements
are fulfilled. As birds of African origin they like a warm place though
they can endure lower temperatures too if it is not wet ; but only if it
is warm enough will they behave and breed in a satisfactory way. My
birds mainly feed on bananas ; and in addition to the bananas, which
I give them all the year, they feed on apples, pears, and other sweet
fruit, and a lot of green food, especially lettuce. They do not take live
insects such as mealworms or grasshoppers but they like fresh ant pupae
especially for rearing their young. Another food they like very much
is white bread in milk and they get it every day. To provide them
with vitamins I use especially Protovit and Sanostol which are both
mixtures of various vitamins, and besides this the birds regularly drink
honey water. The daily quantities of food they need are considerable
as is usual in fruit-eaters, and therefore, also their droppings. But it is
still very interesting for me to observe their strange habits which differ
so much from all other birds so that their real affinities to other bird
groups are not clear up to date. My own opinion after observing their
development and their behaviour is nearly the same as the opinion of
the leading authorities of bird systematics : to leave them as a group
of their own which is apparently not closely related to any other birds.

Although the Violet-eared Waxbill has been bred on several j
occasions before I am none the less very pleased at having bred this
very beautiful bird last season, and I thought a report on this might ;
interest members. Housing : the birds were housed in an aviary
32 by 12 by 8 feet of which the house occupies 8 feet at one end.
The flight is partly covered on the south-east side the rest being
fully exposed and naturally planted, the plants including cotoneaster
hawthorn, privet, and several types of grass ; the covered part of the
south wall is stuffed with ti tree as are all walls of the house except the
front which is covered in rigid plastic sheeting. Feeding : Birds are
fed on the usual finch mixture, with occasionally a piece of cake, and
live food (white ants) are fed regularly. Nesting : The first nest was
built in the shelter and both birds shared nesting duties and sat fairly
tight; however, the eggs (four) proved to be clear, approximate date
4th October, 1963 ; the birds did not hesitate to rebuild in another
part of the house and again sat tight and on 11 th November I found
two young in the nest ; on 13th November on inspection I found the
nest swarming with small black ants and, of course, the young had been
killed. I thought this would be the end of nesting activities, but
the birds built another nest and although it was outside in a clump
of ti tree I left well alone and did not interfere in any way. On 13th
December four young were flying, the period from first egg to flying day
being only thirty days. The four young were well cared for by both
parents and proved to be three cocks and one hen. Having three nests
I thought the birds would be through for the season ; however, they
had a spree until April (it is then starting to get a little cooler) and then
decided to set up house again. On my return from holiday on 11 th April
I found the birds alternately missing and found they had built in the
same bush. I did not hold much hope for another breeding success as
the weather proved to be shocking and the aviaries were practically
flooded. On 24th April both birds were very excited and I guessed the
young had hatched ; on 10th May one young was found dead in the
flight and I would say he had been battered to death by the con-
tinuous rain. On 12th May another youngster was flying and I kept
putting him (as it turned out) into the shelter out of the rain. The
youngster finally became independent. The nest contained one
addled egg (again approximately thirty days). Incidentally, at the
same time the last brood left I also had young Black-cheeked Waxbills
leave the nest but these unfortunately succumbed to the weather.
In August I had to catch the old hen and also the daughter (now with
her own mate) as both were egg-bound. However, both only laid one
egg and I put them in their respective aviaries after one day. At the

Breeding activity seems delayed this year. My hen King started
things going with four eggs, at about the same time as a younger pair of
blue Ringnecks. As usual, the King refused to sit but this time decided
to co-operate to a certain extent ; she sat on the eggs during the day
and left the nest, to roost, at night. The blue Ringnecks' eggs were not
fertile so the King's eggs were placed under her and she hatched two
youngsters which are about half-grown and still in the nest.
The King has now started a second nest and perhaps she will sit
properly. This is her third year of nesting and her improvement in
laying her eggs in the nest-box instead of off the perch is ioo per cent.
Many-colours, usually the first to start, waited until late February
and then after a couple of weeks lost interest. Now (April 12th) they
are looking into the boxes again.
I am afraid my old pair of Princess of Wales's will not produce
anything this year as the male seems to be showing his age. They had
four infertile eggs and should start again soon as he is feeding her.
They have produced approximately seventy young over the past several
years. I think with a young male the hen will still produce.
Bourkes have been a total washout so far. Australian Crimson-
wings are fooling around and fooling is a good word for it as that is
about all they ever do. The hen goes into the box each day and
re-arranges one or two wood chips and for this daily activity I supply
South American grapes and out of season melon. It taxes one's
patience, especially when it goes on for years.
One flight at least is most satisfactory. It contains an Ixora coccinea
which is a bush about 3 feet wide and nearly 6 feet high and is quite
dense. Nesting in this bush, and at the time of writing with young in
each nest, are pairs of Green-wing Doves, silver Diamond Doves, and
Cordon-bleus, also in the flight is a Bachelor Cape Dove which bothers
none of the others. I will not get any medals for this group but the
combination is very interesting to watch.
Mountain Witch Doves have built a nest and it is more of a nest
than any of my other doves build. It is actually shaped and with
quite a hollow centre. They used pine needles on top of the sticks.

It is in a box open only in front and about 4 feet above the ground
under an open-fronted shelter. Two or three palm fronds give a
semblance of privacy. Both birds call and the male seems to have a
slightly higher pitched call than the hen ; also he seems just slightly
smaller. Now and then he gets quite rough and pulls out her feathers.
At other times they do a strange dance--circling around each other for
a few moments--and then he feeds her. Most interesting to watch.

Director Berlin Zoological Garden (Germany)
At the end of 1965, there were 2,583 specimens of birds in 702 different
species at the Berlin Zoo. All the aviaries, cages, and ponds are now
well stocked so that there was no need to acquire many individuals
during the first months of 1966. Among new arrivals the following are
the most important : two Bearded Vultures, a female Satyr Tragopan,
one Red-billed Hornbill, two White-winged Trumpeters, a couple of
New Zealand Scaups (.Aythya novaeseelandiae\ a species which has been
very seldom exhibited in Zoological Gardens, and a couple of South
American Crested Ducks (Lophonetta specularioides alticola).
As usual, the months of February, March, and April were very suc-
cessful for breeding interesting species. In our owl collection, consisting
of twenty species, the Great Eagle-Owls tried as they did in former
years and we got three young ones from them. In March a Horned
Owl hatched. In our rich collection of waterfowl the following
hatchings may be noteworthy : five Cereopsis Geese and four Egyptian
Geese. There were also hatched two black Swans, two Jackass Penguins,
and two Humboldt Penguins.
In the Bird House the Red-whiskered Bulbuls raised three young,
and the Australian Black-breasted Plovers also had three young ones.
The extremely rare Kagus from New Caledonia laid one egg and we
hope that this time we will be luckier than the last year when three
young hatched, but died after a few hours. At the beginning of April,
our Flamingo Colony was starting nesting and laying eggs and we are
sure that the good results we had with this species will be repeated.

Spring seems to be with us now and the more delicate species are
being moved outside from their heated winter quarters. The Bird
Keepers have been extremely busy replacing branches, erecting nest-
boxes, and segregating breeding pairs, especially parrakeets in the
Bird House.
The winter months are always very quiet in the bird section and
this year has been no exception. We have had several new arrivals
including Derbyan Parrakeets, Philippine Ducks, Canary-winged
Parrakeets, Jungle, Bank, and Common Mynahs, White-cheeked
Touracos, and Versicolor Teal.
Chester Zoo's building staff have recently finished rewiring the
aviaries and installing oil-fired heating in the parrot house. This has
given keepers a chance to refurnish the aviaries with fresh branches of
good size.
During 1965 we successfully bred and reared a Kiskadee Flycatcher
in the Tropical House. The Kiskadees were subsequently moved to the
Temperate Bird House and later went to nest in a hollow log about
14 feet above the ground. This time four youngsters left the nest on
the 8th March but unfortunately accidents befell three of them. The
remaining youngster is looking very healthy and at the time of writing
the parents are going to nest again.
Many other species in the Tropical and Temperate Bird House have
paired and are nest-building. The Red-crested Touracos have selected
a nesting site in the rock-work above the waterfall in the Temperate
Bird House and Tri-colour Nuns are very busy building among the
bamboo plants inside the Alligator enclosure in the Tropical House.
A consignment of New Guinea fauna is welcome in any zoological
gardens and on 23rd March we received such a consignment. The
consignment included many birds, the most notable of these were :
Red-sided Eclectus Parrots, Blue-eyed Cockatoos, Louisiade Black-
capped Lories, Louisiade Lorikeets, Nicobar Pigeons, and Plicated
Hornbills. The weather suddenly turned cold the day after their arrival
and so many of them are still in the hospital. However, we hope to put
them on exhibition in the near future.

During 1964 a male Crested Screamer ( Chauna torquata) was sent on
loan, so as to make up a pair, to the Wildfowl Trust and in that year
a chick was hatched, but it did not survive. During 1965 the pair
succeeded in rearing one chick and this, a fine specimen, has been
received here in exchange for its father. The first breeding in this
country of the Crested Screamer appears to be that of 1904 in these
Gardens.
An Indian Pipit ( Anthus novaeseelandiae rufulus ), a subspecies new to
the collection, has been presented by Messrs. G. H. and J. R. Newmark
and other notable gifts are a Green Pheasant from Mr. F. E. B.
Johnson, a Perfect Lorikeet ( Trichoglossus euteles) from Mr. W. H.
Brown, a tame Partridge from Mr. B. P. Meade, and from Dr. K. C.
Searle a collection consisting of a Falcated Teal, six Collared or
Necklaced Laughing Thrushes, two Rufous and one Masked Laughing
Thrushes.
Demoiselle Cranes, West African Wood Owls, a pair of Flame-
crowned Woodpeckers, a pair of Grey-winged Blackbirds, and a
Hunting Cissa have also been received ; three Black Swans have been
bred in the Gardens and Blacksmith Plovers, Cereopsis Geese, Night
Herons, Speckled Pigeons, and some owls are nesting.

Many writers, when referring to the geographical area over which
Floras and Faunas extend, use the Latin habitat (it inhabits). While by
no means incorrect, it is perhaps better to confine the use of this word
to indicate the kind of locality in which a plant or animal naturally
grows or lives, such as sea-shore, chalk hills, forest, etc.

In 1964, A. V. Griffiths's Blue-eyed Cockatoos successfully reared a
young one--the event gaining the award of the Society's Medal. Last
year the pair's breeding results were rather erratic. The hen laid in
the spring but the eggs did not hatch. For some unaccountable reason
they nested again in the autumn and one young one left the nest on
New Year's eve ! Alan Griffiths says : "It appears to be reasonably
fit and is feeding itself, but for some unknown reason is unable to fly.
I hope it will eventually become airborne as I believe it is a hen. It has
a much smaller head and beak than the previous one."

Whooping Crane. The U.S. Secretary of the Interior has announced
that forty-four Cranes are wintering at the Aransas National Wildlife
Refuge, Texas. This figure beats last year's record by two. The
forty-four consist of thirty-six adults and eight young. The number of
adults represents a loss of six from last year. One dead male was found
in western Texas ; it is thought that it had struck a power line. The
fate of the five others is unknown.
With seven Cranes in captivity the world population is believed to be
fifty-one.
"Josephine," mother of four of the Whooping Cranes at present in
the Audubon Park Zoo, New Orleans, died last September. In 1940
a hurricane scattered a small wild flock and the two survivors were
added to the Zoo collection. "Josephine " was then considered to have
been between two and three years old, so at the time of her death she
was about twenty-eight.

Aratinga guarouba is, of course, the Golden or Queen of Bavaria's
Conure. It derives its specific name from the South American
" Guaruba " or " Guarajuba ", meaning " Yellow bird ".
Then how does the Queen of Bavaria enter into the common name ?
This thought is prompted by the fact that Madame A. Billot, President
d'Honneur de la Ligue Fran^aise pour la Protection des Oiseaux,
informs me that she has three of these very charming parrakeets, a male
and two females, and would very much like to know the connection.
It was, I believe, Dr. W. T. Greene, of Parrots in Captivity fame who

Augusta of Bavaria, patroness of the arts and sciences ". Carolina
Augusta (Karoline Friederike Wilhelmine), Princess of Baden (1776-
1841), was the daughter of the Hereditary Prince Karl Ludwig of
Baden. In 1797 she married the Elector Maximilian Joseph von Bayern
as his second wife. When, in 1806, Napoleon raised Maximilian to the
rank of King, Caroline became the first Queen of Bavaria.

Widows or Whydahs ? It was Edwards (Nat. Hist. Birds , 1 , p. 86)
who in 1745 first figured one of the what we now call the Viduine
Weavers. He then said that he was informed that " the Portuguese
call this bird the Widow, from the Colour and long Train The
prevailingly black plumage and flowing tail of the male are maybe
reason enough for a fancied resemblance to widow's weeds. Subse-
quently, Linnaeus first Latinized " widow " in 1776 when he named
the Pin-tailed Emberiza vidua ; and Cuvier adopted it as a generic
name in 1817. Whydah or Whidah is a port in Dahomey, West Africa,
and the name may have been adopted on the assumption that this was
its place of origin. The port also gives its name to a West African goat
Capra reversa , and was also an obsolete common name for the White-
bellied Amethyst Starling, Cinnyricinclus leucogaster. The French name
for the port is Ouidah (pronounced Wee&apos;da). There is here certainly a
distinct similarity to widow. The French make no attempt to adapt
Ouidah in any way but call this group Les Veuves (the Widows).

BREEDING GREY-NECKED CROWNED CRANES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.8999666875" page_id="56366344"  page_num="91" year="" vol="">
With reference to the report about the " Breeding of Grey-necked Crowned Cranes
(.Balearica regulorumy, by W. R. Carthew, and to the remarks in News and Views on
page 28, I think perhaps the following paper will be of interest : " Briitende Kronen-
kraniche (Balearica gibbericeps Rchw) im Budapester Zoo." By F. A. Cerva, Budapest.
In Der Zpologische Garten , Vol. 4, Leipzig, 1931 (pp. 9-13) ; concerning the successful
breeding the Crowned Crane (B. gibbericeps) in the Zoological Garden, Budapest, in
1918. Two young hatched, but at three months they were killed by a sudden change of
weather. The author (Cerva) also mentions the probable successful cross-breeding
(hybridization) of Balearica regulorum Bennet X Crowned Crane from West Africa at
the Amsterdam Zoo (Artis-zoo) but does not state the year. With regard to the state-
ment on page 28 about the breeding of Ural owls (Strix uralensis) in the Nuremberg Zoo
(Tiergarten, 1965 ; it was not three, but two young birds which left left the sitting box
(May, 1965). The birds developed very well ; one of them is now in the Zoological
Garden of Berlin (West) and the ether in the " Tierpark " Berlin (East). Some days
ago (8th March) my old breeding-pair had the first egg of this season in the box, I hope
it is fertile !

IMPROVEMENT IN THE DESIGN OF CAGES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98742" page_id="56366345"  page_num="92" year="" vol="">
The suggestions made by Viscount Chaplin and Mr. C. J. O. Harrison for the
improvement in design of cages used for the keeping of birds in dwelling houses may, i
we must all hope, bring about a much needed change. Since the early days of bird-
keeping the design of such cages has been ornamental with, evidently, little regard for j
the welfare of the occupants. The dealers' excuse that the makers dictate the design
is not acceptable.
It is true that domesticated species such as canaries and budgerigars may live and
thrive under less than ideal conditions and the fact that they have become domesticated
owes a great deal to their adaptability, but many others need to be given the best of
treatment and accommodation if they are to thrive.
In addition to supplying suitable cages, dealers should be compelled to provide
proper advice on the care of the birds sold by them. No doubt some already do this,
but there are some who do not even identify their birds correctly, so can scarcely be
expected to give the right advice on their care. We all know that mortality among the
newly imported birds is far higher than it would be if they were properly accommo-
dated and cared for from the time of capture.
Those who keep live animals of whatever kind have a duty to care for them properly
whether they are rare or common and this duty is equally incumbent on those who
deal in them.
J. J. Yealland.

By D. M. Reid-Henry (Woodford Green, Essex, England)
The Hill Myna (Eulabes religiosa) is a widely distributed species
occupying suitable localities throughout India, Ceylon, and South-
East Asia. It also occurs on many islands of Malaysia and on Palawan
Island, South-West Philippines. Numerous races have been described
upon the basis of size, extent of the peculiar and somewhat extravagant
head wattles, and other details. The most ornately decorated one, and
incidentally the smallest, is that found in South India and Ceylon.
This bird (Eulabes religiosa indica Cuvier) is the subject of the
accompanying coloured plate, and to give an idea of its size, it is rather
bigger than a Common Starling and much more stoutly built.
The largest member of the species is found in Nias Island, and is
named E. religiosa robusta. It is a hulking creature, and not so popular
on this account as a pet. Of the other sub-species, however, enormous
numbers are taken while quite young and hand-reared on lentil paste
and fruit before being shipped to Europe and America. In the latter
continent vast numbers are sold annually and considerable sums are
paid for them. The reason for this as most people will know, is the
facility with which they can be trained to whistle in human style and to
mimic the human voice. They are frequently kept as household pets in
India, and it is a common sight to see one in a small basket-cage
hanging over the door of a road-side shop where it whistles and
" talks " to the world in general. These road-side pets are not ill-treated
in the sense of torment, but they are often badly cramped for space and
the cages are frequently very dirty. The bird's plumage is consequently
rather untidy, but in general they are not otherwise in poor condition.
They are fed almost entirely upon Suttoo and pieces of banana or
mango.
I once came upon a myna in the Calcutta bird market which was
obviously about to give up the ghost ; and because the bird's general
appearance was anything but what one would expect of a very sick
bird, I paid rather closer attention to it than I would normally have
done. Upon close examination I noticed something protruding from
the bird's mouth and that there was great difficulty in its breathing.
This " something " was too short to identify without handling the bird,
so I went to the Baboo (Proprietor) and brought him out to see the
bird's condition. He was not helpful and dismissed the case as just

another impending mortality ; so in some desperation on the poor
creature's behalf, I inquired for the price at which he would sell the
myna to me. Upon being told the price was 15 Rupees (about 22
shillings) I was in no mood to buy what I myself thought was a nearly
dead bird. However, after watching the sufferings for a short while
I could stand the situation no longer, and opening the cage I brought
the bird out, and saw that the obstruction was an end of straw-stalk.
I took hold of this and began to pull the thing gently from the throat.
It was over 2 feet long ; and when it was finally removed, the bird was
replaced in the cage and began eagerly to feed, as obviously there was
nothing otherwise wrong.
This inability to do anything for suffering animals is very prevalent
in the East. For some reason Oriental people are loath to touch an
obviously sick creature, and tend to dismiss the subsequent death as
inevitable. The same thing too frequently applies in the case of sick
people and many family bereavements could have been avoided with a
little less prejudice and a little more compassion. They are adept at
making obeisance to the seemingly hopeless case, but few of them will
ever lift a hand to administer a merciful coup de grace to an injured
creature.
However, to return to the myna, I entered into a somewhat heated
discussion with the Baboo, and finally bought the bird for about half
the price he wanted. It was the only Hill Myna I ever had and it
turned out a fine bird in every way. I later released it in the hills near
to Ranchi when I received an order to move to Singapore.
In captivity these birds are more usually caged than given the
freedom of a garden aviary so that seldom are they encouraged to
breed. But they have bred in captivity although how often or in what
conditions I cannot say.
In the wild state they choose a hole or crack in a tree limb usually at
a fair height from the ground, and there raise their two youngsters
upon fruit and odd scraps of live food. The nest-site is usually a " bone
of contention " between several pairs of these and other mynas, as well
as parrakeets and hornbills. Normally, however, the Small Grey
Hornbill (Tockus birostris) seeks a larger hole than would interest the
myna, who likes the entrance to be on the tight-fitting style.
Birds who use holes other than self-excavated ones are very careful
in their selection of a suitable nest-site. Mynas will inspect a hole
carefully for hours before they decide on its merits. Parrakeets are
just as careful because so often any natural hole may quite easily be
already occupied by a large snake, blood-sucker lizard, or other enemy,
and in the wild there is seldom room for repentance of a mistake.
To digress for a moment, it is interesting to consider that hornbills
need large holes in which to breed, and it is well known that such a hole
could easily be invaded by a large snake. Therefore nature has

sensibly ordained that when a hornbill has decided upon her home and
she has laid her eggs in the selected place, the large hole becomes a
small one ! So small does it become in fact that the female bird can
only just pass out the tip of her beak to receive the food her faithful
spouse regularly brings. This process of shrinkage is brought about by
the birds themselves walling up the entrance with mud and excreta
until the space left is only large enough for the aforesaid feeding. When
the house has served its purpose, the mud is hacked away and--
Presto !--a large part of her moult is complete, although the feathers
are very caked and dirty. Whistler says that during this period of
incarceration she becomes very fat, and upon emerging she can hardly
fly ! This is indeed a hardship for a bird who makes hard work of
flight anyway. Even more remarkable perhaps is the fact that once the
female is out of the nest, the hole is then walled up again until the
young are fledged. Then they are released and can fly well at once.
Hill Mynas, like so many others of the starling tribe are very
quarrelsome birds, and they dwell in small parties so that they never
lack opponents. When they are not having a free-for-all they delight
to sit comfortably hunched up on one leg while they survey the rest of
the world about its business, and sing avian ditties about everything in
general. During the heat of the day only are they silent, but even then
they cannot resist imitating the call of some other hapless bird who is
seeking a lost mate, and thus they make their recreation out of another's
troubles.
It is this characteristic of mimicry above all else that has attracted
the attention of mankind, and so we make him give us sport. But
none the less there have been many occasions when his ability to mimic
a human voice to perfection has caused acute embarrassment, and even
fear as he recalls the spectral voice of some departed soul. It is a
vengeance on us, and there is good justice in it but he does not know
this, and neither does he care, for a myna is above all else a philosopher,
and views his imprisonment with no apparent distaste, no matter the
degree of squalor in which he may be forced to dwell.
It is perhaps ironic that we imprison the myna to amuse us with his
vocal accomplishment, whereas in reality he draws aside the veil to
reveal the shallowness of man. For who but humans could take any
pleasure out of the meaningless repetition of noises which can have no
sense for the bird ?
Ah !--hut perhaps in the passing of time and the process of natural
selection the myna might evolve to understand the words it says : then
we humans will be even more interested to listen in on a " suttoo
party
On reflection, perhaps it is well that not many are bred in captivity,
for we might learn things about ourselves we do not want to know, and
that would never do.

KEEPING DOVES AND PIGEONS :
SOME SUGGESTIONS

This is written for those who wish to keep pigeons or doves in order
to study them or to enjoy their beauty or, I hope, both. I have myself
only kept a limited number of species. I did, however, have some
success with them and therefore feel justified in giving a few general
hints on the subject that I think may help both prospective avicul-
turists and any doves they may acquire. I have repeated a few points
I may have mentioned in previous articles but have not included the
fostering of wild species under domestic doves and training them to fly
at liberty (or rather attempting to do so) as I discussed these subjects
rather fully in the Avicultural Magazine for 1955. The following
remarks apply to wild species and not to the domesticated forms of the
Rock Pigeon or to the Barbary Dove, which do not present the same
problems or present them only to a much lesser degree.
As aviary birds pigeons have many good points. They also have
some drawbacks. On the credit side many of them are easy to feed,
extremely hardy, and long-lived ; non-aggressive towards birds of
other families, extremely beautiful of form, colour and voice, and very
ready to breed in captivity. Their drawbacks are that they tend to be
nervous and timid and, if suddenly frightened, to fly wildly about.
In so doing they are likely to injure their heads against the wire and
to disturb any other birds housed with them. Even pigeons that are
quite tame with their owner and hardly ever panic by day, may do so
at night if disturbed by cats or owls. Nothing is more harrowing for
both the pigeons and their owner than these night panics. A single
dove fluttering wildly against the wires at night will spread the panic
to all others within hearing.
Panicking by day can usually be avoided or reduced to a minimum
by the following means : (1) Avoid suddenly appearing at close quarters.
With birds that are timid, let them see you approach from a distance.
(2) Until the birds are used to their aviary and its limitations thread
or fix a lattice-like arrangement of sticks or rope across those areas of
wire-netting that would otherwise appear to give an unrestricted fly-way.

(3) If hawks or cats are troublesome and cannot be eliminated owing

to legal or sentimental reasons, a double layer of netting, the outer
one about a foot from the inner one and/or a plastic cover over the
top of the aviary flight may help matters. (4) Night panicking can
often be prevented by encouraging the pigeons to roost under cover
where they cannot be seen by an owl flying overhead or a cat passing
by. This is fairly easy to achieve with tame hand-reared specimens
which, if they are always brought into the shelter at evening to roost

when they first start to fly, usually get the habit of doing so and continue
it in adult life. It is less easy to achieve with doves that have been
wild-caught or fully reared by their own parents. It may, however,
be possible to entice or drive them into the shelter before dusk. Failing
this one can catch them on their roosting perches at dusk or after, and
carry them into the shelter. Preferably the shelter should have a light
which can be dimmed and this can be put on for a while when the
birds are put in after dark. Sometimes the birds panic at night, for
some cause which cannot be eliminated, even when roosting in the
shelter. Then the only thing to do is to catch them each evening and
put them into a basket or baskets for the night. The ordinary pigeon
baskets used for transporting domestic pigeons serve very well for this
purpose. All this may sound a lot of trouble, and indeed it is, but there
is no alternative. To keep pigeons under conditions in which they panic
and injure themselves night after night is a positive cruelty not made
more justifiable for being often practised by eminent zoological
societies. However, given luck, forethought, or favourable conditions
the problem of night panics may seldom or never arise.
The question of handling pigeons may well be discussed here. It is
pertinent not only for aviculturists but for anyone who may be handling
wild pigeons for ringing purposes. Most domestic pigeons, and some
very tame hand-reared individuals of wild species, show little fear
when handled. The majority of pigeons, even otherwise very tame
specimens, are, however, frightened when handled although they
quickly recover their composure on being released. When a pigeon is
frightened the slightest pull or drawing pressure on its plumage will
cause the feathers to be shed. This is, of course, a defence mechanism
which in a wild state may save a bird seized by a predator if the latter
has not got a good grip on it. Only the " expendable 5 5 portions of the
plumage are shed in this manner. The primary wing feathers, essential
for escaping purposes, need a strong tug to remove them. Feathers are
not shed in response to very slight pulling pressure unless the bird is
frightened (or the feathers about to moult anyway). An absolutely
tame pigeon that has no fear at all of being handled can be held by
the tail, and even though it tries to fly away the tail does not come out
as it would, at the first pull, were a timid pigeon so held.
A pigeon should never be held by a leg or a wing nor, so far as
possible, should it ever be given a chance to flap or struggle while held.
Quite apart from feather loss or injury which are likely to result a bird
allowed to struggle violently will, especially if it manages to get half
free at some point, be far more frightened by the experience. The
method used by pigeon-fanciers in which the bird is held partly sup-
ported on the palm of the hand with its feet, wing-tips, and tail gripped
together between thumb and index finger is not to be recommended
for use with wild pigeons by the inexperienced. A timid bird is often

<bodyText confidence="0.999684888888889" page_id="56366361"  page_num="98" year="" vol="">
difficult to place in this position and very liable to pull one or both
wings free and lose its tail as a result. If the pigeon is once properly
gripped in this way and then immediately held with its breast against
the holder's body this method is, however, quite satisfactory. A safer
way is to enclose the bird around the folded wings with one hand (or
both if it is a very large species) and hold it against one's body, allowing
it to have its legs free but using sufficient force to keep its wings closed
and counter any pushes from its feet. In the case of very small species
the hand may encircle the bird and it be allowed to grasp a finger.
In the dark pigeons that are tame, and quite often even individuals
that are not tame, can be lifted by placing a finger against the lower
part of the breast and then lifting gently but firmly. If all goes well the
bird will step up onto the finger and if one moves very slowly and
carefully can be carried into a shelter and placed on the desired perch.
This latter being effected by placing its breast against the perch or
ledge and lowering the supporting finger. Sometimes with timid
individuals it helps to shine a small torch on the bird during the
proceedings, but care must be taken not to illuminate yourself or even
your hand. The purpose of the torch-beam on it being rather to
prevent the pigeon seeing you than to dazzle it. Some pigeons, however,
are more liable to panic if a torch is shone on them than otherwise.
But this is such an excellent method of carrying pigeons, preventing
any damage to the plumage and tending to decrease the birds' timidity
rather than otherwise, that it ought always to be attempted before
resorting to actually catching roosting birds.
According to the Victorians, #C horses sweat, gentlemen perspire,
ladies glow." Unfortunately, even the ## glow " of the most ladylike
hand may destroy the bloom of a pigeon's plumage if often applied to
it, leaving a dark, greasy stain. This can be prevented by dusting the
hands with powdered chalk, talcum powder, or even flour just before
handling the bird. This is, of course, in those cases where the pigeon
must be handled at daily or frequent intervals.
If they are continually seeing people who do not molest them, most
pigeons, like other birds, soon become fairly tame. Where, however,
as must often be the case, the owner can only spend short periods
daily with or near them they remain rather wild. In such cases feeding
them (with scattered food so that they can get some of it without
coming very near) only while their owner is present may help. That
is, if he can spend half an hour or so twice or thrice a day sitting quietly
in or near their aviary. A few tame hungry domestic Barbary Doves
are often a great assistance to ## show the way ", provided the wild
species concerned are somewhat similar in size (or larger) and food
tastes. Care should be taken that Barbary Doves are not left with
birds they are inclined to be aggressive to or vice versa. Young
Barbary Doves are preferable to adults for this reason.

Generally speaking the larger species of pigeons are, if wild caught,
more timid and difficult to tame than smaller species. However, they
are easier to rear by hand and hand-reared young ones if taken early
enough from their parents usually remain extremely tame for life. Given,
of course, that they are encouraged to be so. So that provided the
adults breed, as they usually will if fit, however timid they are, one can
always obtain tame individuals by hand-rearing some of their young.
If it is desired to have the birds completely and permanently tame
they must be taken from their parents as soon as the feathers of the back
and wings are beginning to break out of their sheaths. This will be at
between the fifth and tenth day in most species. Young taken at this
stage usually suffer a slight check in growth and condition but if well
fed and not allowed to get chilled they recover and develop into good
specimens. If they are left till well-feathered before taking them from
their parents they are easily hand-reared without any check. But in
most of such cases you will have had your trouble in vain since as soon
as they can fly such late-taken hand-reared young will start to show
fear and unless one can be with them all day long, will soon be no
tamer than if they had been left to their parents to rear.
Young pigeons taken prior to fledging may miss parental brooding
at first. One should not, therefore, try to " copy Nature 55 by dumping
them on a platform of twigs, but construct a snug artificial nest for
them. If they show signs of discomfort through cold, covering them
with a loose cloth or putting beside them a slightly older young Domestic
Pigeon may be resorted to. Once they are well-feathered a pigeon-
basket with a thick layer of peat moss or similar material on the floor
is ideal. They can see through the slats and thus get used to strange
sights and people if the basket is often moved about. They should also
be handled and carried about on the hand as much as possible. The
more this is done at an early age the less nervous of strangers and novel
scenes will they be in after life.
Some people find it difficult to feed young pigeons, but it is easy.
Wait till the young bird's crop is empty (but do not let a young pigeon
remain any length of time in this condition) before starting, as if it is
hungry it will be more co-operative. Grasp the base of its bill gently
between thumb and forefinger of one hand, with the other gently
prise open the mandibles and put some food into the mouth. The bird
will swallow it eagerly, and when this has been repeated a few times it
will gape open its bill as soon as it feels the pressure of thumb and finger
on either side. It seems to aid peristalsis if during the feeding one
" pumps " the young bird's head, by means of the hand holding its
bill-base, up and down in a similar manner to the head of the feeding
parent. Either because the hand-feeding does not supply quite the
right stimuli or because it is less comfortable than the natural way
pigeons being so fed will often cease to gape before their crops are

<bodyText confidence="0.999547133333333" page_id="56366363"  page_num="100" year="" vol="">
much more than half full. If this happens with small young that are
going to be left some time before the next feed one should continue to
feed as long as the young swallow readily when food is put into their
mouths. One will, of course, be easily able to avoid over-filling the
crop, presuming one has some experience of naturally reared pigeons.
After feeding give the bird a drink, and some five minutes later let it
drink again if it will. To do this hold its bill as described and insert it
into a cup of warm water (or other liquid). As soon as it feels liquid
over its nostrils the squab will drink eagerly if thirsty or withdraw its
head if it is not.
I have dealt with several species of Columba and Streptopelia in this
manner. I found, however, a little difficulty in manipulating the
small delicate bills of some nestling Ceylonese Spotted Doves which
were the smallest species I have hand-reared. I was unable to manage
Diamond Dove nestlings and had to return them to their parents.
Probably people with small and delicate hands would be able to feed
such small species.
I do not propose to discuss details of building or designing aviaries,
never having been much of an architect or carpenter myself. Ideally
aviaries should be as large as possible with the sheltered part well
lighted and with a large door or window (easily closed) for the pigeons
to fly through. It is quite wrong to suppose that birds are apt to
become wilder in a large aviary than in a small one. Usually the
reverse is true, as being able to fly to a distance tends to allay their fears.
A pigeon allowed to fly at complete liberty nearly always becomes tamer
and less " panicky " than it was when in confinement. The only
drawbacks of very large aviaries are that it is often difficult to catch
a bird in an emergency and that if the shelter is not as high as the rest
of the aviary the pigeons are less likely to enter it voluntarily to roost.
If well lighted (and the provision of extra windows or open fronts is
usually easy) large sheds, barns, stables and the like may often be
converted into very suitable aviaries. Indeed, pigeons (and other
birds) often nest more successfully in such enclosures, which are
virtually well lighted rooms, than they do in outdoor aviaries. The
reason for this is, I think, that they see less to frighten or disquiet them
under such circumstances. One of the best ways to " steady down "
timid pigeons is to be with them a good deal in an artificially lighted
room (or other place) after dark or before dawn. Not being able to
see anything beyond their enclosure they are very unlikely to flutter
wildly about and, under such circumstances, often become quite at
ease and will display in one's immediate presence after quite a short
time.
The best covering for the floor of the sheltered part of the aviary--or
for any room or large cage--is coarse sawdust. If this is put down
thickly , at least four inches thick that is, it will not blow about. If a

<bodyText confidence="0.999821688888889" page_id="56366364"  page_num="101" year="" vol="">
little of some small seed, such as panicum or Indian millet, which
seed-eating pigeons like, is scattered and buried among the sawdust the
pigeons (I am, of course, referring to seed-eating species) will get a lot
of exercise and interest searching for it. The droppings can be quickly
and easily removed by riddling the top layer of sawdust through a sieve
every few days, and it can be completely renewed as often as deemed
necessary.
Neither the flight nor the sheltered part of an aviary should be too
cluttered up with perches, the latter should rather be arranged so as to
allow the maximum possible amount of flight for the captives. Gener-
ally a perch or two at either end of the aviary, fairly high, and near
them some thick conifer boughs arranged to form sheltering bowers,
will be sufficient. In the case of species that dwell much in thick cover,
however, then some planted bushed or some " artificial undergrowth "
made of conifer boughs would be desirable.
In a very large aviary grass-plots and growing trees and shrubs are
useful and aesthetically pleasing ; in a small enclosure they usually
become merely insanitary eyesores that clutter up the available flying
space. Natural branches usually make the best perches. They should
be of varying thickness but at least some should be of a good thickness.
Larch poles about two inches or more in circumference make good
perches for most species. A few ledges should also be fixed up, both in
sunny and sheltered positions, as many pigeons like to perch and lie
on broad ledges, especially when sun-bathing.
It is usually considered necessary that wild pigeons should have
access to an outside flight where they can get direct sunlight. Certainly
most captive specimens in outside flights one sees in zoos are in better
condition (if they have not injured their heads in nocturnal panics)
than those housed entirely indoors. I think this is due to the direct
sunlight being able to make up for some dietary deficiencies and the
fact that the outdoor aviaries are usually bigger and so the inmates
have more flying exercise. I have kept Diamond Doves inside a room
where they got no direct sunlight at all, although they could--and
did--sunbathe behind the window panes. They kept in perfect health
and reared fine strong young ones. I took care to give them an adequate
diet and attribute to this the lack of ill-effects from their indoor life.
It is possible that adequate feeding would counteract the evil effects of
lack of direct sunshine in other species also. Admittedly, the Diamond
Dove is one of the less demanding species nutritionally, but it does
suggest that the role of sunlight (apart from the pleasure of its warmth
and light which can be enjoyed through glass as well as in the open)
may be replaceable by an adequate supply of " sunshine vitamins "
in the food. But of course if one can give the pigeons access to direct
sunlight one should do so " to be on the safe side ".

largely on seeds do well on a staple diet of seeds when in captivity.
The Diamond Dove and other small species thrive on small yellow
millet (the kind often called " panicum ") together with some canary
seed and maw seed. Larger species (such as most of the turtledoves)
will do as well on a diet largely of wheat or dari (which is less costly than
millet or canary seed), but should have some millet, especially when
rearing young. A little maw seed, lentils, hemp or freshly chopped-up
peanuts should also be given them, quite generous amounts when they
are rearing young or moulting as these seeds are richer in fats and
proteins. The larger species may have wheat, lentils, tares, maple
peas, and whole yellow maize as one would give to Domestic Pigeons.
All seed given should, of course, be of good quality. For this reason it
is, in my opinion, very unwise to give kibbled maize (called " cracked
corn 55 in America), or any ready-broken peanuts or other grains.
It should be obvious to anyone with the slightest knowledge of their
own species that it is not likely to be the best maize or peanuts that
get cracked up commercially and, once cracked or kibbled, grains are
far more liable to go bad or musty, with disastrous results.
If the pigeon cannot or will not swallow whole maize it is better
without any maize at all. Some modern workers on bird nutrition
tell us pigeons must have maize. This is nonsense. Thousands of wild
pigeons never see a grain of maize all their lives. Until after the dis-
covery of America no pigeon in the Old World--wild or domestic--
ever ate a grain of maize. They were none the worse for it. If it is
feared that unless maize is fed (to species that cannot or will not
swallow it whole) the diet will be lacking in Vitamin A, this can be
remedied by judicious use of halibut oil. The latter is an excellent
source of A and D vitamins and can be fed by mixing a few drops with
a handful of seed so that each seed has a little adhering to it, or by
smearing a drop on a peanut and feeding it to the bird. As a precaution
against Vitamin D deficiency it is as well to give seeds thus treated at
least once weekly in the winter months and throughout the year to birds
kept indoors.
Peanuts are much liked by all seed-eating pigeons once they have
been persuaded to start eating them. Species of the size of a Barbary
Dove upwards can swallow them whole (shelled), but for smaller
species they must be broken up. Their fondness for them makes peanuts
excellent food for use as a " titbit " when one visits the pigeons to help
to keep them tame. Often it is difficult to get pigeons to start eating
them. Keeping them a little hungry and then introducing both
peanuts and a hungry pigeon of (preferably) the same or a closely
allied species that does eat them is usually an effective way of starting
them off. Failing this, leaving a constant supply of peanuts (frequently
changed as they soon go bad) in front of them may achieve results.

clover, or young shoots of grass, is an excellent addition if the pigeons
will eat it, as most will. Pigeons cannot bite or tear bits of leaf from
a movable piece of vegetation. So green food fed to them should be
clamped between two bricks or otherwise firmly fixed. Arboreal
species will eat the young budding leaves and flower buds of such trees
as hawthorn, ash, and beech. Berries such as elder berries are also liked
by some seed-eating species. Any completely new foods are best given
in small quantities at first and a watch kept on the result. Foods
which one species of pigeon can eat with impunity may be harmful
to another.
Chopped-up mild or cream cheese and/or bread and milk made to
a moist crumbly consistency are often valuable additions, in small
quantities, especially when the birds are rearing young. When they
have young many pigeons will eat such foods eagerly even if they refuse
them at other times. Those species of pigeons which appear to be
largely insectivorous in a wild state should be offered gentles and
mealworms, as well as, if possible, smooth caterpillars, ant pupae or
any other non-poisonous insects they will take. Some of them may
take minced raw meat. A very successful breeder of Bleeding-heart
Pigeons finds that these birds need plenty of animal protein and thrive
best if given, inter alia , a generous daily allowance of minced raw meat.
Grit and minerals are necessary. I always gave my pigeons the
pigeon grit that is sold commercially, plus some fine gravel or coarse
sand and Kilpatrick's Pigeon Minerals. These latter are sold by a firm
of that name in Belfast. They look rather like iron filings and have
a slightly salty taste. I always intended to have them analysed but
never got around to doing so. All species of pigeons that I have kept
have eaten these (Kilpatrick's) minerals in considerable amounts
when they were feeding young. Even individuals that were flying at
full liberty, and so able to supplement their rations with wild foods,
did so.
I have not kept any of the fruit pigeons. Many that I have seen in
captivity in zoos have been in rather poor condition. It is usual to feed
these birds on chopped-up fruits which are best (provided the pigeons
will eat them so treated) dried off with a little biscuit-meal to avoid
soiling the feathers around the bird's mouth with juice. In a natural
state, of course, these birds pluck and swallow whole fruits and berries.
Some of them tear pieces from larger fruits but these are generally of
a less juicy and sticky nature than cultivated fruits. Boiled maize is
also given to fruit pigeons and the few people who have bred them
successfully have usually given them bread and milk when they had
young. There is clearly much room for experiment in the feeding of
captive fruit pigeons. I make a few suggestions which I think might
prove useful although I have not had personal experience of keeping
these birds :--

(1) The diet should be supplemented where possible with wild
fruits and berries, given on the branch.
(2) For the green pigeons (Treron species) which digest the seeds
of wild figs they largely eat ; soaked millet or wheat might be
added to the diet, possibly enclosed in a bit of date or fig.
(3) It should not be assumed that fruit pigeons do not need grit
or minerals. Some of them are known to take such substances when
wild.
(4) When wild fruit pigeons show much activity in gathering
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.988324742857143" page_id="56366367"  page_num="104" year="" vol="">
food. The possibilities of getting them to do so in captivity might be
explored. Fixing favourite items of food so that the pigeons had to
clamber among branches and/or hang head down to reach them,
might be contrived.
(5) The possibility of partly supplementing the fruit diet by
cubes of wholemeal bread made moist with some reliable " artificial
nectar " as given to nectar-feeding birds, might be tried out.
Being highly arboreal fruit pigeons are often reluctant to come to
the ground for food in captivity. Probably because when hungry they
do not (as ground feeding species do) " expect " to find food at ground
level. Their food and water, therefore, should be made available to
them at perch level.
With all kinds of pigeons care must be taken that newly arrived
birds can find their food and water. Seed and grain are much better
scattered on some clean and clearly visible part of the aviary floor
(which can easily be cleaned daily) than put in a container. Even if
one wishes to give the food in dishes some must still be scattered around
conspicuously at first to enable the bird to find its source.
Most species of pigeons are very keen on sun-bathing and water-
bathing. The need for suitable ledges in the sun has already been
mentioned. For water-bathing a large dish (the bigger the better)
or small pool should be provided. Most species prefer to bathe in
water that is not very deep, about deep enough to reach the feathers
of the pigeon's underparts when it is standing fairly erect is usually
right. If a dish is used it should be of terra cotta or some other material
not too smooth and slippery White or glass dishes are to be avoided
as often pigeons (and other birds) fear to step into water if they cannot
see the bottom clearly Many wild pigeons and even young domestic
pigeons have difficulty in learning to jump up on to the edge of a dish
to enter it. This is, no doubt, because when in bathing mood their
instinct is to walk down into the water. Surrounding the dish with
some bricks (or any similar objects) that come level with its rim will
get over this difficulty.
In a natural state pigeons often bathe in rain showers and have
special movements of lying on one side and lifting the wing for use in

this position. In captivity many species will soon learn to accept
a gentle spraying from a hose as a rain-shower substitute. Although,
so far as England is concerned at any rate, if they are in an outdoor
aviary they will get enough of the real thing in most years.
So far as is known to me dust-bathing is indulged in only by the
Spectacled Ground Dove. Possibly some of the other lesser-known
species from dry countries will be found to have the habit too. The
oft-repeated statements that such species as Rock Pigeons and Turtle
Doves dust-bathe are certainly untrue. Many observers seeing pigeons
lying on the ground sun-bathing in warm (and sometimes dusty)
situations have often wrongly thought they were dusting themselves.
However, with any species it can do no harm to supply facilities for
dust-bathing "just in case ".
It is pleasant to see captive birds nesting in natural-looking sites and
building their own nests, but it is seldom possible for them to do so
successfully unless they are alone in an aviary with suitable trees and
nesting materials. Generally one will have to compromise and supply
artificial sites. For branch-nesting species shallow baskets, saucer-
shaped pads of heather or wickerwork, or small seed-boxes supply
what the pigeons consider ideal sites. They should be fixed in situations
where they are, so far as possible, protected from heavy rain and where
the sitting bird will not be easily visible to prowling cats or owls flying
overhead. If a pair of doves choose a site in the branches where they
cannot build a nest, a basket (or the like) fixed in the exact spot will
usually be enthusiastically accepted by them.
For nesting materials twigs, heather stems, and rootlets, as " wiry "
as possible and of varying size should be supplied. For all ground
feeding species they can be scattered on the floor. For arboreal species
it would be better to tie them to perches or to the wire near a perch in
such a way that the individual twigs could be easily pulled loose by
the male. Dead grass stems and dead leaves could also be provided.
For hole-nesting species nest-boxes, either with a hole for entrance or
with the front only half-boarded up, are readily accepted. They should
have some clean sawdust in them fairly deep as some hole-nesting
species make only scanty nests at times.
As a general rule a breeding pair of pigeons will need an enclosure
to themselves. Only if one can afford enormous enclosures can success
usually be otherwise obtained. Pairs of the more aggressive species will
seldom settle down to breed unless they have killed or completely
cowed any others of their kind sharing their quarters. In less aggressive
species enforced proximity may induce a certain mutual tolerance, but
if it does so the resultant interest and interference in each other's
family-life can be as harmful--so far as successful breeding results are
concerned--as outright aggression. Birds of other families are usually
ignored and if they do not interfere with the pigeons can be safely

housed with them. These remarks about incompatibility and the
converse are, of course, generalizations.
There seems to be room for experiment and enterprise in the matter
of keeping wild pigeons. In particular in the matter of discovering
really suitable diets for some of the less often kept species and/or means
of providing adequate exercise. Many of the problems involved vary
greatly in different parts of the world. Places with warm climates and
plenty of sunshine enable many species of birds to be kept with far
less attention to housing and diet than would be needful in colder and
less sunny areas. I would urge all aviculturists who keep wild pigeons
to make careful notes on their behaviour as about many species little
is known.

By A. W. E. Fletcher (Helsby, Cheshire, England)
About two years ago I acquired a small collection of softbills,
largely because it included a pair of Rothschild's Grackles, which I have
wanted to keep for many years. The whole collection was housed in
an old conservatory, thirty feet long by twelve feet wide and roofed
over with wire-netting eight feet high. The sides of the conservatory
are partly lined with plywood and the remainder with wire-netting,
and there is a small outside flight (twelve feet by six feet) for use in fine
weather.
The conservatory is planted with a grapevine, various flowering
shrubs, and clumps of herbaceous perennials, with a large shallow
earthenware sink for bathing and drinking, and the outside flight
contains a large privet bush. Various nest-boxes of different types are
provided.
The rest of the collection is of no concern here, but during the summer
of 1965 the Grackles came into marvellous condition. They appeared
to be a true pair, as one spent a great deal of its time " singing " in
a manner very reminiscent of our common Starling, but although
they were occasionally seen carrying nesting material, no serious attempt
was made to breed.
One day early in September when I went into the aviary to feed the
birds, only one Grackle was to be seen and a little time later the other
was spotted sitting outside on the ridge of the conservatory. I should

add that the conservatory ventilators are kept open, the upper part
being occupied by a flock of fantail pigeons !
The appropriate action was taken and a catching cage baited with
mealworms placed on the roof of an adjoining aviary, but a thorough
search of the wire-netting lining failed to reveal any gap through which
the bird could have escaped. By nightfall the escapee was still at large,
and I retired indoors thoroughly depressed. But worse was still to
come.
On visiting the aviaries the following morning both Grackles were
at large and as soon as I appeared they flew off to the top of a large
copper beech in the next garden three hundred yards away. At this
point I wrote them off, but the same afternoon a quiet inspection
revealed them inside the top half of the conservatory. They seemed
quite at home with the fantail pigeons, but were obviously anxious to
get at the mealworms and fruit inside the aviary below.
The next morning one was back inside and the small gap in the
netting had been located. But as neither bird had been near the
catching cage it was too risky to mend the gap while one Grackle was
still at large.
This state of affairs continued for some days but when finally both
Grackles were found inside the aviary, I was so intrigued that I decided
to leave the gap and see what happened.
During December, February, and March the birds spent most of
their time inside, only venturing out if the sun was shining, but since
mid-April (this is written on May 25th) both birds have been out daily,
entering the aviary for a short time only, early in the morning when
feeding takes place. For the rest of the day they are prominent in the
garden. The sight of a Rothschild's Grackle sitting on one's chimney-
pot and chattering away to itself as if it has never lived anywhere else
is quite enthralling. In fact they do not remain close at hand, and
have been reported in a neighbour's garden nearly half a mile away.
Normally both birds when at liberty keep close together, but for the
last week, although both birds have been in the aviary for morning
feed, only one has been seen in the garden. As there are several starling-
size nest-boxes among the forty odd nest-boxes in my garden, perhaps
something interesting is happening.
The birds are in tip-top condition as can be imagined, and though
still keen on their mealworms and orange, they are more or less
ignoring the proprietary soft food, so a good deal of natural food must
be being taken. I was not even annoyed when I saw the two of them
attacking apple blossom.
To conclude, the enjoyment of seeing these birds for more than
eight months completely at home in a Cheshire garden more than
makes up for the risk of losing them, which must almost certainly be
inevitable.

(Erythrura cyanovirens regia)
By J. Dalborg-Johansen (Odense, Denmark)
Rare specimens amongst the imported birds have always had an
exciting effect on the buyers of birds and it is, therefore, hardly
surprising that I, who have always regarded the Parrot Finch family
as one of my favourites was extremely interested, when in January, 1963,
T found the Royal Parrot Finch on the price-list from an English bird
importer. With the help of good friends I managed to order two pairs
and I waited in anxiety for their arrival. But as it so often happens
(also from Danish dealers) the birds existed only on paper and nine
months passed before I received the message that they had arrived in
England.
It was certainly not without anxious feelings that I left for Copen-
hagen to receive the Royal Parrot Finches on 15th September because
the small amount of literature I had found about this parrot finch
breed described it as being delicate and eating hardly anything but
fruit (specially ripe figs). " The Royals 55 arrived in Kastrup in one of
the usual English cardboard boxes, but through the breathing-holes
I was able to ascertain that all four were alive and when I shortly
after moved them to a box-cage they seemed lively and in good con-
dition, except for slightly damaged plumage especially round the beak.
On my return home I placed all the four birds together in a small
aviary. In the beginning they were very shy and restless, but they
readily went to food and water. The feeding had, of course, caused me
some considerable worry but my worries had been unnecessary as
I found that they could be fed in exactly the same way as the other
known species of Erythrura such as Red-headed and Three-coloured.
Their food consisted of various sorts of millet, canary-seed, millet
sprays, and soft food mixed from sprouted seed, chopped egg, coarse
universal food (Sluis), bread-crumbs, and grated carrot. They prefer
the soft food and next the canary-seed. According to several authors
fruit should be the Royal Parrot Finch's main food, however, they only
ate a little sweet apple and nibbled oranges, but not more than my
Red-headed Parrot Finches. Greens are hardly touched at all.
The Royal Parrot Finch comes from New Hebrides where they,
according to H. Bregulla in Die Gejiederte Welt , live in the mountain
woods and preferably eat ripe figs. I did not give my birds figs at all,
because I thought that the ripe figs in the New Hebrides are completely
different from the dried sticky figs it is possible to buy in this country.
They would very quickly change the branches and feeding cups to
a sticky mess and make cleaning difficult. Fortunately, the Royals do
not seem to miss the fig feed, or perhaps rather the fig pips which
they pick out with their strong beaks, and are in a very good condition.

Shortly after their arrival the four Royals started moulting and they
did not gain their beauty until the spring, 1964, because all through the
winter months they were moulting slightly, especially on their heads.
I think it is about time to give a description of this beautiful species.
The Royal Parrot Finch is the biggest and most powerful of the
Erythrura. Its plump body, short tail, and strong beak and legs almost
gives the impression of a Hawfinch, but the strong red and blue
colours make it beautiful.
Description
Head, forehead, crown, neck, and cheeks, scarlet ; throat and chest,
deep blue ; back and wing-coverts, deep green ; wing flight feathers,
brown with green outer vane ; belly and under-rump, greyish-green ;
upper rump and upper tail-coverts, strong red ; tail feathers greyish-
brown with red outer vane, the middle feathers slightly prolonged on
the older male birds.
While the distinctions between the red and the blue colours are
sharp, the blue colour on the chest gradually turns into the greyish-green
on the belly.
The beak is large and greyish-black, legs and feet are brown. The
claws are strong, they grow rather quickly and have to be cut.
Differences in Sex
According to the literature male and female should be alike, but in
my opinion there are some clear differences. The fully coloured males
are stronger and livelier than the females, the beak seems bigger, the
blue colour deeper and more shiny, and it stretches right back between
the legs. Furthermore, like the rest of the Erythrura species the males
have a song, a long rolling tone which is a little deeper and more
melodious than that of Erythrura psittacea and Erythrura trichroa. The
frequency of the song can be rather varied. Although I listened
eagerly, I did not hear the old male sing for the first time until the
female had been brooding for some time, while the two young males
sang frequently long before they were fully coloured.
In the middle of April I separated the four imported birds in two
" pairs ", at that time I could only feel sure about the one pair which
consisted of the strongest and the weakest coloured of the four. Each
pair was placed in a small aviary (1 * 3 by o * 9 by o * 6 metres) in the bird
room. Two wicker-nests were hung up in each aviary, one on the bare
wall and the other in a tuft of pine-tree branches. The tuft, however,
was quickly destroyed by the birds ; they took off all the needles in a
couple of hours. Furthermore, I placed without great expectations, a
bunch of coconut fibres, dried grass, and moss in a corner.
To my great surprise both pairs had spread all the nest materials over
the floor, the very next day, and three days later the certain pair had

built a very untidy nest from coconut fibres in the wicker-nest on the
wall.
Unfortunately, I had to join a congress for Zoo-vets in Vienna, so
I was forced to leave the exciting events for a time. A friend of mine
looked after my birds and on 11 th May found by nest-control three eggs
in the Royals' nest. A couple of days later the birds seemed to have lost
interest in the eggs and the nest, and the eggs were transferred to a pair
of Bengalese which had just started brooding. It really was extremely
lucky because at the time I only had the one pair and four unsexed
young birds. The Bengalese brooded steadily on the three eggs which
were all fertile, and on 27th May one young hatched (the two others had
died in the eggs at rather a late stage).
The youngster was quite big, yellowish-red with yellow beak and
two papillae (blue) on each side of the beak. It was looked after very
well and left the nest 22nd June.
The immature feathering was dull dark green with blue head and
neck and yellow beak. The big yellow beak and the dark colour of
the feathers reminded me of a young eagle, when begging food from
the much smaller " foster-parents " at the opening of the nest.
Meanwhile, the pair had repaired the nest and the first of four eggs
was laid 21st May. This time they brooded steadily from 23rd May.
The female brooded most of the time during the day, only replaced by
the male, when she ate, drank, and bathed. During the night both
birds as a rule were in the nest.
On 7th June it was obvious that there must be young ones, both
parents often went to the soft food, and there were piping noises from
the nest. On 8th June everything was all right, there were distinct
noises of youngsters. The following day, however, both birds, which
since the brooding started had only left the nest one at a time, were
flying around restlessly in the aviary, when I came in the morning and
on the floor I found a dead youngster (which by the way had been well
fed). At the end of an hour the parents were still agitated and they
showed no sign of interest in their nest. I, therefore, removed the nest
and found two live youngsters and a very dark egg. What could I do?
Youngsters and egg were wrapped in a handkerchief and placed
in my pocket while a telephone hunt started to find a suitable pair of
foster birds. Personally I only had the one pair which looked after
the first young Royal and a pair of young Bengalese which had just
laid their first egg.
The telephone hunt lengthened out and my pocket was not the best
brooding machine, so I decided after all to put the youngsters and the
egg into the nest of the young Bengalese, without any hope at all as
they had not even started brooding yet. To my astonishment they went
into the nest after a great deal of agitation and neckstretching, and
stayed there. My astonishment grew, when two hours later I found

three well-fed young Royals under the Bengalese. The last egg had by
some miracle also hatched. The three youngsters were looked after in
the best possible way and left the nest on 5th July in perfect feather
condition.
On 25th June the female was brooding again steadily on four eggs
as I discovered later, and this time everything went according to
programme. On 10th July noises were heard the first time from the
nest, and by careful nest control while the parents were flying, on 16th
July, I saw two well-fed youngsters. After that there was no more
nest control but noises from the nest gradually grew louder, and the
parents fed well. The youngsters left the nest 5th August, but they were
fed for another three weeks especially by the male. The female gave
no sign of starting a new family. The parents and their young agreed well
together, even when the youngsters were about 8 weeks old and started
getting red feathers on their heads.
The food consisted of the above-mentioned soft food mixture with
plenty of chopped eggs, sprouted millet, and canary seed. I did not
see them eat fruit at all and the young birds only took a little apple.
Later on all the six young birds were moved to a bigger aviary where
they were flying together with youngsters from Red-headed Parrot
Finch, Gouldians, and various small insect- and fruit-eaters ; they were
very peaceful towards the others but chased each other from time to
time. The time taken to moult into full colour varied considerably,
but averaged about two to three months. The young Royals managed
the moulting well and have developed into beautiful strong birds and
it looks as if they will be three males and three females, judging from
colour and behaviour. If this proves to be true it means that it is
possible to sex this species as soon as the birds have left the nest because
the blue colour on the head is stronger and more widespread on the
males.
Finally a few figures (these must be taken with a certain reservation
resulting from experiences with only one pair of Royal Parrot Finches).
Size of eggs, 14 by 18 mm. ; colour, white with a faint rose ; size of
clutch, three to four eggs ; brooding time, 15 days.
The youngsters stay in the nest twenty-six to twenty-eight days, and
are completely independent at the age of seven weeks.
The coming into colour starts at the age of seven to eight weeks and
lasts approximately two to three months.

By Sheila M. Rogerson (Whitegate, Cheshire, England)
I was introduced to Chinese Painted Quail three years ago and
shortly afterwards a young pair arrived to make their home in a large
flight which had at one time been a rarely used summer-house. The
house makes an ideal winter shelter for them during the worst of the
weather and outside they have the added pleasure of grass, soil, a
rockery and a shallow pool. Perhaps a planted aviary would have been
more suitable for them but never-the-less, it has given me the oppor-
tunity to observe them closely at all times. No other ground birds
have been introduced and at present they peacefully share the aviary
with a pair of Rosella Parrakeets.
Chinese Painted Quail are most delightful birds, little more than a
small ball of feathers. The cock reminds one of a black and white
minstrel as he has a broad white band edged with black immediately
under his beak. He is gaily painted with slate blue and rich mahogany,
his wings being mottled and striated with varying shades of brown and
grey. In comparison the hen lacks all the vivid colouring of the cock
but she in her turn is exquisitely marked with fawns and browns.
Our particular pair are completely unafraid and I am told that in
old China they were kept as household birds. The Chinese placed them
in the deep sleeves of their gowns, the high body temperature of the
Quail providing warmth to the hands on the cold wintry days. They
are however, most difficult to catch, and entertainment runs high when
watching my husband on his hands and knees, the Quail always one
move ahead of him.
Mating activity begins in the spring heralded with the cock's
courting display. He fluffs out his feathers, lowers his wings and darts
rapidly at the hen who, woman-like, pretends she never even noticed.
Undaunted he repeats this demonstration and finally gains her co-
operation. She proceeds to lay several eggs which are dotted about on
the ground in no particular pattern. These eggs are obviously not
intended for incubation as both birds spend many industrious moments
rolling them around the aviary and in doing so, they eventually crack.
Apparently this procedure is quite normal as in the wild, these cracked
eggs provide an ideal breeding ground for flies whose larvae provide
a nutritious source of food for the Quail chicks on hatching. Sure
enough a second clutch was laid in a nesting site chosen by the cock.
He prepared an entrance tunnel leading to a rough nest in a large
clump of grass which was growing on the rockery. This evidently was
acceptable to the hen who completed the nest and laid an egg each day
until there were six. They are a little larger than a Budgerigar's egg,
more pointed at one end and are faintly mottled with fawn and brown

on a pale olive green. The hen began the incubation and proved herself
an excellent sitter only leaving the nest for a hasty visit to the shelter
for food and water and the occasional tit-bit which the cock found for
her. This unselfish act is typical of these little birds and all his life, these
tasty morsels are offered to his wife or children only rarely indulging
in a quick snack on his own.
At the onset of the incubation the cock selected a large flat stone in
the corner of the aviary on which he stood guard every day. He began
to utter a low, husky, two-note sound which I feel is to exclaim danger
to any other Quail entering his territory. A series of these " crows "
are uttered at various intervals throughout the day interspersed with
his familiar high descending call " I got six eggs ". The hen also calls
but never crows.
On the eighteenth morning the cock Quail entered the nest for the
first time, obviously to assist with the hatching, as shortly afterwards
a neat mound of shells were placed outside the nest. Within an hour,
a tiny fluffy chick ran out, only to be hustled back by a harassed father
who was clucking just like a broody hen.
Young Chinese Painted Quail are exactly like good sized bumble
bees and begin to grow real feathers only after their first week. They
can run about from hatching and peck their own food. Every few
minutes they return to either parent for warmth and completely
disappear into their feathers. All that can be seen is an occasional
tiny leg which has lost its footing. The cock is equally efficient at
looking after his family and in fact often takes on more than his fair
share of the duties.
When the chicks are three weeks old it is possible to sex them accur-
ately as all the cocks develop the characteristic white throat feathers.
Unhappily they also develop definite suicidal tendencies and will
readily drown themselves in less than half an inch of water. They can
squeeze through most netting during their first few days of life and
later on they will trap themselves in the most unusual places and ex-
haust themselves in an effort to rejoin the rest of the family. They are
experts at finding that small gap in the aviary boundary (which you
didn't even know was there) and if they are over enthusiastic in
stretching their tiny wings, or are suddenly frightened, they rise
straight up into the air like little helicopters and often land in the
strangest places for Quail. We have found them on high shelves and
ledges from which they are too scared to jump down again. A regular
watch must be taken as they soon chill and die. My kitchen often
becomes an emergency ward and many little Quail have been " cooked "
back to life on my cooker and dosed with brandy and warm milk. This
remedy is an excellent pick-me-up and in no time they are running
around the aviary, jumping up and down in high glee, like little fleas.
The family keep together en bloc and certain places become the

chosen ground for different activities. The look-out stone now became
a favourite resting place, all the birds tightly packed in a circle, tails to
the centre. The soil in one corner of the flight quickly dries in the
warmth of the sun and great enjoyment is experienced in a communal
dust bath. They scratch the soil to a fine tilth and scatter it into their
feathers. Much preening takes place and frequent rests are taken
during this vigorous activity. It is quite alarming at first to see them
resting during these baths as they lie motionless on their sides, their
orange legs outstretched as though completely lifeless. Then up they
jump, full of life again, on to some other pastime. This dry bathing
appears to be their only method of keeping clean.
A second family is planned almost before the first is a fortnight old.
The same pattern is continued and the rolling eggs are laid before the
second nest is chosen. This time the chicks help with the rolling some-
times gathering two or three together and sitting on them for brief
spells. When the hen begins the second incubation period, the chicks
accompany her but they soon tire of this and eventually leave their
mother in peace. The cock is banned entirely from the nest and is
quickly " shown the door " if he ventures too close.
If the family is still together when the second chicks are hatched, the
older chicks help to bring up their tiny brothers and sisters offering
them tit-bits and brooding them as efficiently as the adults. However,
they are inclined to be a little rough with them so perhaps it is wiser to
remove the first family when the second is imminent.
Barring accidents, successful rearing of Chinese Painted Quail
depends first on keeping the chicks dry in the early stages and
secondly, on a regular supply of live food. No ant is safe in our garden
as my husband turns every stone in a constant search for a nest of ants,
the eggs of which are eagerly disposed of by the tiniest chick. The adults
enjoy a few maggots daily but they are quite adept at finding their own
supply of spiders, flies and small worms from the aviary, particularly
if some rotting compost or manure is placed in an unobtrusive corner.
During the winter months these Quail remain happy and thrive well
providing they are kept in a dry and frost free shelter. Boredom can be
kept at bay by covering the floor with a thick layer of dry compost
which is industriously turned over in an expectant search. When access
to the flight is denied them, it is essential that an abundant supply of
grit is offered as these birds do not shell the seed and require the grit
to assist the digestion of their food. Their basic diet consists of panicum
millet, a small amount of maw seed and of course, clean fresh water.
They sleep on the floor and a pile of soft hay in a favourite corner will
ensure a cosy sleeping place.
Chinese Painted Quail are certainly a challenge to keep and breed,
but the immense pleasure of watching a family of these birds is worth
all the care and attention which they require.

THE BREEDING OF TICKELL'S BLUE
FLYCATCHER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986662097560976" page_id="56366378"  page_num="115" year="" vol="">
(Muscicapa tickelliae)
By The Rev. Canon Lowe (Backford, Chester, England)
Into a heavily planted aviary were placed during the first week in
March a pair of Tickell's Blue Flycatchers. They had wintered in a
large double-compartment cage, a wire partition dividing them. The
hen is exceptionally tame and takes mealworms from one's fingers
indoors and in the aviary.
The aviary is 12 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 ft. 6in. high. In one
corner is a small shelter on legs, 4 feet long, 2ft. 6in. wide, and 3 feet
high, with two doors--one at the side that is always open, the other in
front is always shut--and at the side is a glass panel protected on the
outside by wire.
When first introduced into the aviary both birds clicked a great deal
and wagged their tails sideways, but did not attempt to fight, as
softbills of opposite sexes so often do. The weather was kind and the
birds got a good deal of sun on their backs. They roosted in the inner
compartment, but not together. March, April, and May passed and
nothing happened, except that the herbaceous plants and other
greenstuff had produced a nice little jungle, and a small heap of pig
manure was introduced to encourage insects.
During the first week in June it was noticed that the cock Tickell had
altered the whole contour of his body ; from being a blue Robin he
now became a round ball with a head and a tail, the lower light buff
area very noticeable together with the deeper colour on the chest, and at
the same time the hen began to carry grass bents. It was two or three
days before we discovered the nesting site. The back of the aviary
consists of a wall upon which another 3 feet height of wood has been
placed to gain height, and 2ft. 6 in. of boarding makes a roof, so that in
very wet weather the birds can keep dry. Box and gorse branches
form perching accommodation at the back of the aviary. The nest was
being built on top of a gorse branch, about 6 feet from the ground.
On 7th June the nest was almost complete and on 9th June we
saw the birds pair for the first time. There is a curious ritual about
this activity. Before pairing the hen sings and calls, she appears to
elongate herself, the tail is raised in a half fan, and she quivers her
wings. The cock flies straight on to her back. After pairing the cock
faces the hen, throws his head up, elongates himself, and the chestnut
throat patch is very noticeable. He holds this remarkable posture for
as long as 10 to 15 seconds.
The hen appears to do all the nest building, though the cock follows
her about with his curious ball or blown-up appearance.

I 1 6 REV. CANON LOWE-BREEDING OF TICKELL's BLUE FLYCATCHER
On ioth June the first egg was felt in the nest. Because the hen was
so very tame I risked examining the egg. It was a self-coloured egg,
darkish fawn, rather like an English Robin but with no blotches and
a little larger.
On 13th June there were four eggs in the nest. This could only be
ascertained by touch as it was not possible to look down into the nest
with any comfort. One must assume the first egg was laid on 9th June.
The nest was then left strictly alone.
On the afternoon of 25th June, when the hen had come off to feed,
the interior of the nest was examined by touch and the nest seemed
full of young. A hasty retreat was beaten.
It seemed remarkable that there had been quite so short an incuba-
tion period, but the hen might have started to sit tight on 12th June,
particularly as we discovered about the third or fourth day that the
nest contained three young and one egg.
Both parents were first class in their attention to their children, and
fed them assiduously on gentles and mealworms, and once a dessert of
spiders, but supply could not be sustained. We cut the mealworms up
at first, but gave that up as the birds seemed to prefer feeding whole
mealworms, and one supposes they know how to administer a mealworm
to an infant Tickell. As the babies grew it was apparent that all was
well, as the almost black fluff appeared plentiful and dry. The colour
round the beak was yellow ; the colour of the gape was not seen.
About the sixth or seventh day nest sanitation was begun, and left
as far away as possible from the nest. In common with so many
softbills there was always a bit of a ritual about this. It did not occur
every time a parent visited the nest to feed, and I never saw the cock
do it, always the hen, and her method of flight altered as she flew away.
All the faeces were placed on a large flat stone, so they were easy to
examine, and always they were beautifully black and white. Once a
half digested maggot was discovered. We never saw the hen feed
maggots ; the cock fed maggots and mealworms.
On 5th July the nest was empty and the parents were in a very nervy
state, clicking and singing incessantly, beaks full of mealworms, and
diving to the bottom of various clumps of Michaelmas daisies and
golden rod and dive-bombing a perfectly innocent pair of Japanese
Quail, whose main object in life is to appear invisible.
By 5.30 on 5th July I could bear it no longer, I found all three
babies and put them in the inner compartment, blocking the side
entrance, though leaving about 4 inches from the top to allow the
parents to enter and to allow the babies to go out when they became
airborne. The babies were very good at being caught, making no
protest, though the parents hated it. But the babies were safe under
cover, and I am not absolutely certain I trust Japanese Quail. It was
anyhow a comforting sight to see three tiny figures sitting on a very

low branch fast asleep and the parents surely grateful to know where
all the family was.
The babies are a greyish brown on the back, buffish fronts with a
little striation on upper breast. Very like infant Robins ; no trace of blue.
Our troubles are not over. A pair of Wren Babblers have con-
structed a charming little nest of bamboo leaves with a little roof also
of bamboo leaves in a bamboo clump. All four eggs are fertile ;
the eggs are an off-white, finely freckled with small pinkish-mauve dots
on the thick end. But food is going to be a problem.
The Tickell's nest was examined. The cup was deep, main structure
consisted of moss and dead grass, lined with rootlets. Hair and feathers
were offered, but ignored.
The hen Tickell did not brood chicks at night after the fifth day.
21st July. The three young Tickells are now feeding themselves
though occasionally parents feed. There are signs that they may be
going to nest again. When the young left the nest they appeared very
small, but now are about three-quarters size of parents. The wings
and tail would appear to have a wash of blue over them.
The Wren-Babblers duly hatched four young, but threw them out
of the nest on the second day, which was inconvenient for all concerned !
A second nest has now been built, again with old bamboo leaves.
Mr. W. Timmis, of the North of England Zoological Society, has
seen the young Tickells as an independent observer.
As described, The Rev. Canon Lowe has bred Tickell's Blue
Flycatcher (Muscicapa tickelliae). It is believed that this may be a first
success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this
species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communi-
cate at once with the Hon. Secretary.

By J. J- Yealland
The plumage of the White Pelican is said to assume a pink tinge in
the breeding season and it appears that this colour is due to a carotenoid
pigment taken by the bird in its food. Early this year we gave some
canthaxanthin in the food of our White Pelicans and within three or
four weeks, without moulting, the birds became a delicate shade of
pink. What evidently happens is that the carotenoid affects the colour
of the preen-gland oil and so the plumage becomes tinted as preening
proceeds. The tip of the bill is seen to be quite red from the same cause
and an old bird (which came in 1922) is not so pink as two younger
ones, possibly because it may not preen itself as much as they. If the
colour is seasonal, it is presumably due to some change in the diet or to
a change in the pigment content of the natural food, but how lasting
the anointed colour is one cannot say, but I suspect that it either fades
quickly or is washed off in the course of bathing.
Among birds presented by Dr. K. C. Searle is a specimen of Fire-
breasted Flowerpecker ( Dicaeum ignipectus ignipectus ), a species new to
the collection as are two owls that he sent as juveniles in 1965, for
they have proved to be Glaucidium cuculoides whitelyi , Whitely's Barred
Owlet. Others from the same donor are a pair of Garganey, a Falcated
Teal, five Masked Faughing Thrushes, a Rufous Faughing Thrush, and
a Scarlet-backed Flowerpecker ( Dicaeum cruentatum ).
Other presentations include six Picazuro Pigeons from Mr. Tom
Spence who bred them, a Large-billed Hawk or Buzzard ( Buteo
magnirostris) , an Ornate Lorikeet, two Aharoni's Eagle Owls [Bubo
bubo interp0situs) , an Eastern Grey Plantain-eater ( Crinifer africanus
zonurus ) and an Eastern Kingbird ( Tyranus tyranus I.
Two immature Double-crested Cormorants ( Phalacrocorax auritus
Jloridanus ), a Red-legged Thrush (Turdus plumbeus rubripes), both species
new to the collection, a Red-bellied Woodpecker, and two Tawny-
shouldered Blackbirds (Agelaius humeralis) have been received in
exchange from the Havana Zoo. Other arrivals of note are two
Gannets, three pairs of Ruffs, and four White Storks.
Among the birds bred in the Gardens are two Night Herons, four
Kenya Eagle-Owls, four Sonnerat's Junglefowl, and two Crested
Pigeons. Chinese Pond Herons are nesting as are Cormorants, Great
Black-backed and Herring Gulls, Princess of Wales' Parrakeets as well
as some of the geese and pheasants. Baillon's Aracaris nested twice at
the Bird House, but each time the two eggs disappeared after being-
incubated for some days. Humboldt's and Black-footed Penguins
hatched chicks, but they did not long survive.

In an American magazine I have just read : "A birdman is an
ornithologist but a bird woman is an aviatress." At first I feared that
someone had invented a rather fanciful name for a lady member of
a society such as ours. But my fears were groundless because I find that
this name, together with aviatrix, is the feminine equivalent of aviator.

A Moorhen ( Gallinula chloropus) and three chicks frequent one of our
ponds, and one with two chicks another. I do not remember seeing
other than very small broods. The number of eggs, according to
Witherby, is "usually 5 to 11, sometimes only 2 to 4, occasionally
up to 21, and 26 once recorded ". Probably the higher numbers are
due to two hens laying in the same nest. I think all the Moorhens I
have observed must have been in the 2 to 4 group.
The name is apparently derived from the Anglo-Saxon mor , meaning
morass or bog.

The breeding results, 1965, in the penguin colonies at the Scottish
National Zoological Park, Edinburgh, were rather disappointing.
Gentoo Penguin : twenty-two nests were occupied, eleven chicks were
hatched but only five were reared. Considerable disturbance was
caused by breeding participation of the 1963 consignment ; five eggs
were stolen from nests ; and several days of continuous storm caused
several nests to become water-logged with consequent chilling of the
eggs. Chilling and damp also interfered with the rearing of the young.
King Penguin : fourteen eggs were laid but only one chick was
hatched and reared. Again the weather conditions were thought to be
responsible. At the end of the year there were thirty-seven King,
fifty-seven Gentoo, one Rockhopper, and one Jackass Penguin in the
Collection.

Sacred Ibis successfully hatched two chicks, but they were unfortun-
ately blown from the nest.

It was Thomas Fuller, Of Travelling , " The Holy and Profane State "
(1642) who wrote : " Know most of the rooms of thy native country
before thou goest over the threshold thereof." This might have been
written for the benefit of the modern type of holiday-maker who per-
haps has never previously been further afield than the nearest seaside
and yet flies to the Continent for his holiday. It applies equally well to
the majority of bird-keepers : especially to the present writer.
Having spent the greater part of my life in the care and breeding of
exotic species I have greatly neglected the study of our native birds.
Now, retired from keeping I have ample opportunity for the all-
embracing activity called " bird-watching ". And what pleasure I am
deriving from it ! Being country-bred I am afraid I have always taken
our birds rather for granted. But, as quoth the Raven, " Never
no more."

IMPROVEMENT IN DESIGN OF BIRD CAGES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999665607142857" page_id="56366384"  page_num="121" year="" vol="">
Mr. J. J. Yealland writing further on the suggestions for the improvement in the
design of cages, made by Viscount Chaplin and Mr. C. J. O. Harrison is of course
quite right in his comments, particularly in his last paragraph, which I quote, " Those
who keep live animals of whatever kind have a duty to care for them properly whether
they are rare or common and this duty is equally incumbent on those who deal in
them." Sufficient is said here except when one looks at the address from which
Mr. Yealland presumably writes, namely The Zoological Society of London, Regent's
Park, London, N.W. 1 and I am stung to comment.
Zoological gardens are the principal criteria by which wild creatures in captivity
are judged by ordinary visitors, ardent naturalists and " born free " conservationists
alike. In my opinion the preservation of fauna, particularly birds in some of our leading
zoos leaves a great deal to be desired, and possibly does greater damage to the image
of aviculture in this country than all the deplorable foreign bird stands at each National
exhibition of Cage Birds and all illegal bird trapping put together.
The " concentration camp " method of animal presentation at the Regent's Park
Zoo still exists in the Bird House and to an even greater extent in that abhorrent
building called the Parrot House. It is always with grief that I come away from that
place knowing of the many wasted and perverted lives that exist within.
From my earlier days as an aviculturist to the present day I have become increasingly
aware of the need for aviculture to mature into something rather more worth while
than the keeping of a collection of feathered pets merely to gratify one's particular
need. I now hold the view, and would wish to apply it to all public and private
collections alike that no wild creature should be kept in captivity unless provision is
made for the particular species to reproduce itself in conditions where reasonable free
movement is possible.
In a way, I suppose, I am apologising for keeping wild creatures in captivity at all,
am conscious of my failures with certain species and yet am seeking to justify my
pleasure from aviculture by proving its value in just one field, conservation.

I do believe that many avian species will become extinct within my lifetime, unless
a " real " approach involving aviculture and education is made (possibly the most
important part of the conservation project is the need to make everyone feel
responsible for conservation).
Aviculture when applied to conservation does work; there are many instances, and
the result can be additional nuclei of breeding stock safe-guarding a natural dwindling
population.
No serious conservationist or aviculturist can seriously doubt this but there remains
a great deal of spade work to convince a large proportion of nature lovers of the true
value of aviculture and similarly a large number of " bird keepers " to convince of
their responsibilities towards their stock.
This has moved rather from the main point of the letter but if I may corrupt a
proverb slightly I should ask Mr. Yealland to remember that perhaps even the servants
of those who dwell in glass houses should not throw stones.

ADMIRAL GEORGE CHURCHILL

<bodyText confidence="0.970096388888889" page_id="56366385"  page_num="122" year="" vol="">
In a recent letter an official of the Lord Chamberlain's Office writes :
" I do not know if you know the paintings in the royal collection by Bogdani which
illustrate in great detail the birds in an aviary which belonged to Admiral George
Churchill, brother of the great Duke of Marlborough.
We are planning to have in The Queen's Gallery this autumn an exhibition of birds
and animals and we hope to show in the exhibition some of these fascinating canvases.
The birds have been almost completely identified by Mr. Goodwin, but I wonder
if anything is known about this aviary. Printed authorities on George Churchill merely
state that in the last years of his life he devoted much time to it. On his death he
bequeathed it to the Duke of Ormond and Lord Torrington. It would be very
interesting to know when the Admiral began to build up the collection. It must have
been housed somewhere near the present Frogmore House."
Derek Goodwin informs me that the birds depicted are assorted mixtures of wild
species such as Ruff and Goldfinch and Common Shelduck, together with domesticated
varieties of pigeons and ducks, and poultry.
I have not been able to trace mention of the Admiral and his avian interests in such
books as I have. If any reader knows of sources of information I would be pleased to
hear from him.

By K. S. Dharmakumarsinjhi (Dil Bahar, Bhavnagar, India)
I revisited the Garden at the end of June, 1966, after almost a year.
For those who do not know of Mr. G. C. Jain and his aviaries, I should
like to give a brief description. Mr. G. C. Jain is primarily a business-
man of Bombay with many hobbies, but his recent interest has been to
promote Indian aviculture and acquaint himself with the birds of the
world. With this idea in view, a few years ago he started bird-keeping
at Dhrangadhra, where he has his chemical factory. Dhrangadhra is
a small town in North Saurashtra, Gujarat State, almost bordering the
Little Rann of Kutch. The climate is dry and hot during summer and
coldish during winter, with an average rainfall of about 15 inches.
The Bird-Zoo as the Garden is officially called is established in the
premises of the Chemical Compound where Mr. Jain, the proprietor,
resides when on tour. The aviaries are well-planned as they do not
protrude into the garden or house. In front of the house there is
a large spacious lawn and beyond this, near the compound wall, are
a line of aviaries facing the house. There are shady Neem trees on the
side of the lawn and a few spreading Ficus trees, one of which has a pool
under it for Storks and Flamingos. The front western aviaries contain
Parrots and Parrakeets and are shaded by a line of large Peltoforum
trees which have golden yellow flowers and which form an excellent
background to the vista. The Psittacidae have done very well and I saw
some fine hybrids, Red-breasted Parrakeet X Rose-ringed Parrakeet
which had been bred here. The climate seems to have suited this
family and all the birds were in perfect condition and plumage,
including the Macaws, which beautify the garden immensely. On the
south side of the compound wall, there is a row of aviaries which hold
mostly Indian Pheasants, Toucans, and Hornbills. In front of these is
a small Japanese Garden with a pond and fountain on which is an old
Japanese man astride a huge carp set in bronze from whose mouth the
fountain water flows. Close to these aviaries is another section where
birds of prey are housed. I saw Bonelli's Eagle, Tawny Eagle, Great
Indian Horned Owl, Kestrel, Shikra, White-eyed Buzzard-Eagle and
Barn Owl. In one large cage are kept White Peafowl. Behind this are

kept Thrushes, Babblers, Crows and Tree-Pies. I saw a brown
House Crow, a quite unusual colour mutant.
Following the south section of aviaries towards the east, one sees
another line of Pheasantries, where species like Crossoptilons, Reeves's,
the rare Swinhoe's and the yellow Ghigi and Golden and Lady
Amherst's pheasants are kept, also Ring-Necks. Then one comes to a
large high aviary in which a landscape garden has been artificially
set up. The background portrays a mountain cliff with holes and
cavities and a waterfall. The water falls from rock to rock leading to
a small pool in the centre of the aviary in which waterfowl such as
Lesser Whistling Teal, Pintail, Wigeon, White-Eyes, Nukta,
Spotbill, Ruddy Shelduck, and Bar-headed Goose amuse themselves.
In the rocky shelf I saw Himalayan and Malabar Whistling Thrushes,
a glittering Monal, White-throated Ground Thrush, Common,
Grey-headed, and Bank Mynas, and even a pair of Indian Rollers.
Small Grey and White Wagtails, Pipits, Buntings and Indian Robins
delighted in perching on rock eminences and entering the cavities in
search of shade and food. This large aviary is planted with evergreen
trees in which I saw Black Bulbuls, Touracos, Green Fruit Pigeon,
Median White Egret, Purple Heron and others. The trees are the
roost of a pair of African Crowned Cranes. All the birds are full winged.
On the floor, Red-wattled Lapwings, Indian Stone Curlew and
Demoiselle Cranes walk. The rear part of this huge cage is kept for
sick birds and those which show aggressiveness. It is a separate depart-
ment.
Adjoining the main bungalow and behind a Japanese portico and
garden where a purple Bauhinia tree blossoms in winter is the most
outstanding feature of Mr. Jain's garden ; the small flight community
aviary. This is the most remarkable exhibit I have ever seen depicting
co-existence. For no aviculturist would dare to keep together so many
different species of birds at the risk of their fighting and being killed.
The beauty of this aviary is that owing to the wide mixture and quantity
of birds, they seem to have equal rights in the aviary which prevents
them from exerting their rights of territory. At feeding time, abundant
food supply enables all the birds to feed contentedly. Moreover, an
electric bulb lit at dusk and kept burning the night over attracts
innumerable insects, especially during the monsoon. Hence natural
food is plentiful. In winter and summer, mealworms which Mr. Jain
had flown over from Europe, and are bred here, are given to almost all
the softbills. This unique aviary has a rockery from where a trickle of
water flows down to a small bird-bath and is planted with small shrubs
and dry branches for perches and roosts. Nest-boxes of varying sizes
are also placed near the roof and on wooden columns. I listened to the
songs of Chloropsises, Shama, Cardinals, Barbets, and many small birds,
and talked to a talking Hill Myna. The aviary is an amazing potpourri

of avian life that one can see flitting about as if under a mountain
stream. It is indeed an astonishing and bizarre sight for any visitor.
I was amused to watch a Banded Crake search for food in quickening
step amidst the rocks and a White-breasted Waterhen standing near
the bird-bath preening itself. Once or twice I heard an alarm call of the
Red-wattled Lapwing or from the Yellow-wattled Lapwing as some
bird of prey flew past the aviary. There was a sudden hush as all birds
kept silent and immobile, but just for a few seconds, more in curiosity
than in fear, since most of them were aware of their safety. This is an
ideal aviary to study bird-behaviour in relation to each species.
Bad manners appear seldom except when at feeding time two birds
compete for the same food from finger tips. Competition for roosting
is almost eliminated by the number and variety of roosting sites.
I cannot restrain myself but give the list of birds housed in this aviary
which draws the attention of most foreign visitors.

lutino and albino Budgerigars, and bright little birds as Painted,
Indigo, Rainbow Buntings, Cordon Blues, Gouldian Finches and
Saffron Finches all together. I saw oddities such as Yokohama
Fowl, Muscovy Ducks, Chinese Bantams and the like. This is not
even a small part of the birds that are in the Garden.
I had arrived after the first rainfall and it was dry and sultry. The
Jains, their friends and I sat on the lawn under the shade of a " Neem "
tree eating breakfast and listening to the calls of Cockatoos, Grey
Parrots and chattering of Parrakeets and Lories. I saw wild Rose-
ringed Parrakeets alighting in front of the aviaries on the ground and
on the netting flirting with their brethren inside. The garden attracts
wild birds and I saw Red-vented Bulbuls making their nests in hedges
and White-throated Munias coming down to make friends with the
multicolored finches. In the backyard of the vegetable garden during
a morning stroll I flushed a covey of Grey Francolins, and listened to
the booming call of a Bustard-Quail. The Koels were flying from tree
to tree searching for an entrance to a Crow's nest; Franklin's Wren
Warblers, Tailor Birds and Brown-backed Robins hopped from one
hedgerow to another seeking food.
Soon the time for feeding the White and Painted Storks arrived and
I requested the owner of the Bird Garden to feed them. The Painted
Storks have been hand-reared from birds caught from the nest, and
though they are fully fledged and flying at liberty, they have not
assumed their full nuptial plumage, although they are in their second
year. Traces of pink tertiaries are seen, but the deep beautiful glossy
green of the wing coverts and secondaries are not as bright as they
should be. The Painted Storks delighted us in picking food out of the
shallow pool as if they were probing for food in a village pond. They
kept walking in the shallow pool with their mandibles partly open
and snatching up food that was cast for them. They also came
near to take food from the hand. The White Storks were not quite
so friendly as they had been brought in adult stage. These storks are
migrants to Saurashtra and come in some numbers in the grasslands of
Gujarat in October, feeding much upon locusts and their larvae.
The Indian Ornithological Garden is a private enterprise and
entirely the creation of Mr. Gian Chand Jain who now has acquired
considerable knowledge regarding aviculture. He has a fine collection
of bird books including a near complete set of Avicultural Magazines
which he reads through slowly but surely. Furthermore, the non-
profit-making garden permits visitors free entry and produces a bi-
monthly journal, the Peacock, which has fast become popular. Issues
at present are sent free to those interested in having them and are
exchanged with various ornithological and zoo periodicals. The Bird
Garden is no doubt one of the largest in India and it is remarkable that
such an interest is sustained in this country when we see such hobbies

fast disappearing. Mr. Jain is a dynamic personality and his ambition
has no limits. He hopes to save vanishing Indian birds by breeding
them in his Garden and is keen on collecting rare birds. The lack of
expert personnel to manage all this is a frustrating problem and often
adverse conditions threaten the supply of essential bird foods. Un-
daunted and unhesitatingly, Mr. Jain seeks the advice of experts
from India and abroad to improve his pet project. While enjoying
his kind hospitality we were struck with the sudden death of the
Hon. Director, Mr. B. V. Ramanjulu, who had devoted himself to the
management of the Bird-Zoo. This is a great blow for us, and the
Garden has lost a sincere and hard-working friend who will always
be remembered. Under his supervision the Garden has a total of
1,114 to JjUg birds, 354 species of 45 Families in 13 Orders,
a very handsome collection of aviary birds indeed !

House, reared two young which left the nest on 4th June, 1966.
The nesting site was rather unusual--a hole in a circular pole
supporting the roof at a height of 9 feet from the ground. The entrance-
hole was very small indeed, the Pagoda Myna having quite a struggle
to enter. The pole is hollow right down to the ground so we assume
the birds must have wedged some material cross-ways. The smallness
of the hole and the fact that the edges stand out about an inch precluded
any inspection of the nest or eggs.
Both parents fed the youngsters on a diet of maggots, flies and small
pieces of meat, whilst in the nest and fcr several days afterwards. Food
was first seen being carried to the youngsters on 17th May and they
finally left the nest eighteen days later.
The young are now fully independent. They resemble the Grey-
headed Myna in size and general colouration but have a dark grey cap
and more grey coloured underparts.
Mr. Prestwich tells me the only record of this cross is a note by
Dr. Hopkinson in which he says : " Whitley reared one in 1927, which
I saw in August, fully feathered and in perfect condition. Head grey,
intermediate in colour between the black and pale-grey caps of the
parents. Four more were reared in 1928, and all five were still alive
in 1930."

(Mino coronatus)
By W. R. Partridge (Lower Haselor, Evesham, Worcestershire)
The Golden-crested Myna (Mino coronatus ), also classified by
authorities in the genus Ampeliceps , is a most striking bird in appearance.
The male has a clear yellow head, face and throat, orange bill, legs and
feet, on an otherwise all-black body with the exception of a yellow patch
on the wing. There is also a small area of yellow skin surrounding the
eye. The female differs from the male in having the yellow on the
head only coming down to the eye, which has no yellow skin surround-
ing it, but grey ; a little yellow on the chin, but none on the throat,
also the crest is shorter and the head and beak are slightly narrower
than in the male. This is quite apparent in the young, even a few days
before they leave the nest. Adult birds are about 8J inches in length.
Whilst the Golden-crested Myna is most commonly found in
northern Thailand, it is also found in smaller numbers in Vietnam,
Laos, the Malay Peninsula, and is a resident of the Tenasserim district
of Burma.
It was in the spring of 1964 that I purchased four young Golden-
crested Mynas, which were kept caged until June and then turned out
into an open, planted aviary with shelter, where they remained until
early the following spring. Two were then removed and the cock left
with the hen he appeared to have chosen. Late in April they went to
nest in a hollow log hung horizontally, about 5 feet from the ground,
and laid four eggs which proved to be infertile. After the eggs were
removed they went to nest for a second time, again without success.
This year (1966) the pair again went to nest in the same log, in April,
and on 9th May I removed one clear and two addled eggs from the
nest. The latter had probably been too long chilled fairly early during
incubation, as the hen always left the nest at the sound of anyone
approaching the aviary and sometimes took a long time to return. On
22nd May the hen was missing, and the cock spending most of the time
sitting near, or on, the log the nest was in. The pair which had been
rather wild until this time, became steadier, the hen not leaving the
nest to anything like the extent she had done in the past. I did not
inspect the nest until 5th May, which I estimated to be fourteen or
fifteen days after incubation had started, and I was pleased to find
one chick hatched and three eggs. On the following day, 6th May,
I again inspected the nest and found a second chick had hatched. The
two remaining eggs did not hatch and later proved to be infertile.
Both chicks were reared and left the nest on 1st July, when twenty-five
and twenty-six days old.
The chicks, which were completely devoid of any body-fluff when

hatched, had pink skin which darkened considerably as they grew,
and yellow gapes. At twelve days quill feathers were beginning to show,
and at twenty-two days one chick showed distinct beginnings of a
yellow cap. This chick also had a stronger head and beak than the
other, and I was fairly certain they were a male and female. Now, at
the time of writing this article, three weeks after they have left the nest,
I think there is no doubt. There is one chick showing a broad band of
yellow reaching from the beak to a line slightly behind the eye, the
other showing very little yellow, just above the beak. These chicks
were feeding well ten days after leaving the nest, and are certainly
self-supporting, although still with the parents.
The nest in the log was constructed of a few twigs and very little
grass, and placed right at the end of the log, furthest from the entrance
hole. Very little material was added for the second nest. The hen
alone incubated the eggs, but for the first week or ten days after
hatching, I saw the cock leave the nesting log on several occasions,
and assume he was either feeding the hen or assisting with feeding the
young, but cannot be certain, as I never saw him carrying food or
entering the nest. I think the first assumption the more likely, as the
hen hardly left the nest for the first few days after hatching, and after
eight or ten days I never observed him coming out of the nest again.
Both birds have proved excellent parents.
The food given throughout the rearing period was minced raw meat,
maggots, sweet apple, insectivorous food, and soaked biscuit-meal.
Only live food was fed for the first few days.
The eggs were blue-green in colour with brown blotches of varying
size, these being larger and more numerous at the thicker end of the
eggs, in most cases, but one in the last nest having equally large
blotch markings on the middle and thin end. In every case except
the one mentioned above, markings were fewer and smaller round the
middle and thin end of the eggs.
Throughout the breeding this aviary was shared by a pair of Red
Ground Doves and a pair of Cayenne Seedeaters.
The first reported breeding of the Golden-crested Myna was by
Mr. Boehm, Trenton, N.J., U.S.A., in 1964, and an article on this
breeding by Mr. Charles Everitt, was published in this Magazine for
November-December, 1964.
As described, W. R. Partridge has bred the Golden-crested Myna,
Mino coronatus. It is believed that this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at
once with the Hon. Secretary.

In December, 1963, the National Zoological Park received four pairs
of Black Francolins from Calcutta, and on joining the Zoo staff in 1965,
I was impressed with the beautiful appearance of these birds. Having
never before seen this species, I checked the literature and rediscovered
" The Black Francolin " published in the January-February, 1963,
issue of Avicultural Magazine. In his article Mr. Yealland gives
a fine account of the range, diet, and egg description of this species ;
however, a description of the bird itself is lacking. Thus, the following
may be of some benefit and interest to aviculturists.
In size, the species is just slightly larger than the familiar Indian
Chukar Partridge, although it usually appears larger because of its
outstanding coloration. Males are predominantly black with prominent
white cheeks and a rich chestnut band encircling the neck. There are
conspicuous white spots on the black background of the flanks and
nape. The rump and upper tail-coverts are narrowly barred horizon-
tally with alternating black and white. Feathers on the top of the
head, back, shoulders and upper wing are black with a broad fulvous
edge, appearing predominantly fulvous. The beak is black, and the
feet and legs are red.
The females are slightly smaller than males and closely resemble the
Gray Partridge, Francolinus pondicerianus. They can be differentiated
immediately, however, by the same barred pattern as the males on
rump and upper tail plus a chestnut patch on the nape.
The Black Francolins at the National Zoo are all housed together
in the large indoor Tropical Flight Room (rain forest), and they have
proved compatible, keeping together in a flock. During the breeding
season they pair and take up separate territories, but no serious
fighting has ever occurred. They remain quite wild under these
conditions, as is expected of wild-caught birds.
For a season one of the birds was housed outdoors in a large flight
cage and survived the Washington winter in good condition despite
a 3-ft. snowstorm and temperatures as low as 8* F.
Although the National Zoo has not reared this species to date,
Black Francolins are being raised with no apparent difficulty by
private breeders in the United States. I personally hope to see this
species better established in captivity in the near future, for they are
one of the most beautiful francolins and should be a welcome addition
to any collection.

(Zonotrichia capensis)
By Herbert Murray (Brentwood, Essex, England)
This little bird--about the size and build of a Reed Bunting--comes
from Brazil and is a neat, attractive bird although not brightly coloured.
The back is brown and the breast is grey and the head--which carries
a semi-erectile crest--has a definite dark stripe between two brighter
streaks, a rufous patch is on the neck.
In habits it is rather similar to the Red-breasted Finch although its
display is nothing nearly as impressive or indeed as explosive as that
of the Red-breasted Finch.
Basically the Pileated Song Sparrow is very close to the general run
of European Buntings but there are of course several differences in
habits.
Out of the breeding season the food consists largely of seed but live
food is appreciated and eaten. One habit of the bird when feeding is
a quick jerk backward which although not a scratch in the accepted
sense has the same effect.
Once this bird is acclimatized and provided it has a warm shelter
heat is not essential; it seems hardy and as said before is a neat and
attractive inmate of an aviary.
I had a few pairs sent to me last year and I put a pair in a large
aviary and they went to nest but nothing hatched. Pairs can be sexed
when adult but there is not much difference between the sexes.
This year I put two pairs down in separate aviaries and have
managed to rear one young bird from each pair so far.
It is in the actual nesting of the bird that some curious traits are
observed.
Firstly, I have never known a South American bird that bothered
about having its nest or young looked at. With Tanagers for example,
I always look closely and see that the young are all right every day.
But this little bird when nesting is the most shy and secretive bird
I have ever struck--much worse than any European Finch that I have
ever bred and I think that I have perhaps caused birds to desert by just
an occasional look at the nests. Why this should be when everything
else from South America is so indifferent is rather hard to say.
The nest is a rather deep cup built of grass and roots and is usually
about five feet above ground. The same nest is used throughout the
season. The eggs are grey heavily splotched with dark grey and
a rusty ring at the larger end, number one to three.
The young are covered in dark charcoal-grey down almost black
and have yellow patches at the sides of the mouth.
The young are fed on live food, and I should imagine also by

regurgitation, but they are difficult birds to watch owing to their nervous-
ness when they have young. When anybody goes into their aviaries--
and these are very large in my case--a constant alarm call is given.
When eggs are in the nest the hen slips off as soon as anyone approaches
and one gets the impression that they must be badly harried in their
own country.
The young birds when they fly--which seems a good three to four
weeks after hatching and much longer than any comparable birds
I know--are rather jolly little chaps similar in plumage to their parents
but without the rufous patch on their necks and with the breast heavily
spotted.
They are most carefully hidden and looked after by their parents
who attack savagely and will indeed kill any bird about the same size
that comes too near.
I do not know where the " Song Sparrow " comes in as I have
always found them rather quiet.
As some readers may know over the last two years I have managed
to get a colony breeding of the African Golden Sparrow going and
indeed last year reared about 25.
As they were destructive of other birds nests I disposed of all except
an odd pair that have reared young this year.
In my opinion these are colony nesting birds and the commencement
of breeding would probably require a colony, but the ones that have
bred this year were born in the aviary and indeed are not yet in full
adult plumage themselves.
This has been a very poor breeding season as far as I am concerned
with nothing very much to show at the end of it.
As described, H. Murray has bred the Pileated Song Sparrow
Zonotrichia capensis. It is believed that this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this
species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communi-
cate at once with the Hon. Secretary.

SOME FINAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE MATING
BEHAVIOR OF SNOW PIGEON x BLUE, BARLESS

By Professor Carl Naether, Encino, California
The hybrid pigeon, above referred to, mated to a blue, barless
Strasser female, fertilized four sets of eggs, all of which produced
seemingly healthy squabs. However, all except one, as shown in the
accompanying illustration, died at an early age, usually from one
week to ten days after hatching. In all instances, they appeared to be
normal in bodily structure and were well fed. In one case, they died on
the same day ; in the remaining cases, deaths occurred at a few days'
interval.
The hybrid parent male, described in some detail in Avicultural
Magazine for December, 1965, in other words, proved entirely fertile
in all his matings. In the various nestings, he showed at first a certain
reluctance to share in the brooding of the eggs, leaving them the moment
I approached the aviary in which the pair was kept. However, with
successive broodings, he became much tamer, remaining on the nest,
where he took his regular turns at incubation. His wild, snow pigeon
ancestry seemed to manifest itself in vicious wingflaps at my passing
the nest site and " snort-like " thrusts of coos--behaviour of which he
never tired. He had inherited the sharp " kuck, kuck, kuck ", oft
repeated, from his Snow Pigeon father. Incidentally, this wild pigeon
sound resembles considerably the so-called drumming of our domestic
Trumpeter Pigeon, suggesting a possible inheritance from very early
ancestors.
As suggested by the illustration, the only surviving squab fathered
by the hybrid male, boasts a soft, rather light blue, with complete
absence of wing-bars, which figured so prominently in the male parent's
wing-pattern, they being black there, and also in the Snow Pigeon's
three broad bands of brown running across the median and greater
coverts and the secondaries. Apparently, the influence of the barless
mother, the Strasser, has made itself felt here very conspicuously. As in
the hybrid male, the youngster would suggest a reversion to the blue
ancestral rock pigeon, with a remarkable absence of white, which
forms so large a part of the plumage coloration in both the Snow
Pigeon and in the Strasser. Incidentally, this rather rare hybrid, at
the age of five weeks, is very plump and heavy and short. During his
sojourn in the nest, he showed strong defensive tendencies, as with
neck and breast feathers almost standing upright, he would rear up to
peck vigorously at my " threatening " hand again and again. Being
well fed by both parents, he remained in the nest-box nearly five weeks.
Certainly, in so far as plumage colour, bodily structure, and size are
concerned, as well as kinds of ancestry, this hybrid youngster is unique !

(.Progne suhis )
By Norman P. Sholar (Mooresville, North Carolina, U.S.A.)
The Purple Martin is the largest of the swallows and being a
swallow it is one of the most graceful of birds in its manner of flight and
actions. The male is a very deep purple being closer to black but with
the definite purple gloss that shows up when the sun shines on it. The
female is duller and shows a greyish white on the underside. The
young resemble the female until the first moult. The tail is forked.
Another characteristic common to swallows is that in most cases
they nest in colonies, sometimes as many as a hundred pairs if food
and accommodation are available. They take all their food on the
wing having very large mouths to catch the various insects they relish.
Their feet are very small and weak for the size of the birds, reminding
one of the small feet of the Fairy Bluebird. Water is obtained by
swooping down over open water and skimming with mouth open,
similar to the action of the Chimney Swift.
The Purple Martins migrate from Brazil in late December and
early January. They reach the United States from early January,
taking a leisurely time to reach their home of the year before. They
arrive in North Carolina during the first two or three weeks of March,
the time being determined to a large degree by the weather they
encounter on the way. After raising their young they again depart in
August for the return to Brazil.
This article is not meant to describe the physical features of the
Purple Martin and the writer refers the reader to any of the well-
known books on North American Birds for a more detailed description.
The main purpose of this article is to give the readers an account of
hand-rearing two Purple Martins and some interesting facts from
this experience.
I have attempted for over eighteen years to attract Purple Martins
to my yard. I have placed hollow gourds and martin castles with no
results as far as getting martins to remain and nest. Once they nest
they will return unfailingly year after year to the place where they
were born, provided there are enough houses or gourds to go round.
This year, 1966, I tried a new approach in the hope that I will have
the Purple Martins next year; however, only time will tell whether
success will come or not. A friend who lives some six miles from my
home has many martins and I asked him to let me have several very
young martins that were still a couple of weeks from leaving the
gourds. He let me have four from different nests. These were brought
home and placed in a box with a cloth in the bottom so that the
young would have something to hold to and to keep their feet from

spraddling or spreading out. The young would not open their mouths
as is the case with most baby birds when food is offered. Even though
they would be hungry they still would not open their mouths so we
resorted to forcing their mouths open and feeding with our fingers
a dehydrated puppy food that is known as Friskies in this country.
This is a 24 per cent protein food which includes 7 per cent fat and
many necessary elements for proper growth. The food is in the form
of small pellets and just the right size for the small birds. The pellets
were soaked in water and then a pellet at a time was placed in each
mouth. Knowing that the martin is a most heavy eater of insects we
gave them many meal-worms plus the meal-worm beetle plus the
pupa stage of the meal-worm. The four ate so much that I could not
supply enough live food to keep more than two of the birds alive.
After increasing the live food the other two progressed very favourably.
They much preferred the live food to the other. However, I forced the
eating of the dog food soaked in water so that they might have moisture
of some kind. The meal-worm beetles were dipped in pure honey
before being forced into the mouth. Purple Martins eat many bees
while raising young, therefore I thought that the honey would be
a desired addition to their diet.
The force-feeding was continued for over a week before the babies
would even open their mouths for food. I can assure you that they are
large eaters and I hardly see how the two parents feed four or five !
During the second week I placed the two babies in a cage in the yard
where they could see their surroundings and the martin houses and
gourds. Anyone familiar with training flying tipplers and racing
pigeons will see the need of this procedure of familiarizing the birds
with their immediate locality. They remained in the cage another
ten days staying out night and day. They soon began to sit on a small
perch and to exercise their wings. All the time we were still supplying
all the beetles and worms they would take, plus the beetles dipped in
honey. At the end of ten days the young were released one at a time.
The first one flew towards a tree and attempted to land on the leaves
which it couldn't hold on to ; therefore it fell, then flew to another
tree and made a poor attempt at alighting. After the young finally
was able to catch on to a limb it remained for a long time, being
exhausted--all the time making its call-note to the other one still not
released. The one in the cage would also make a call-note and they
soon were able to stay in contact with each other. The one that was
free finally came down and tried to alight near the cage, but there
wasn't anything for him to alight on, so I placed a long pipe from an
eight foot stepladder over to the cage hoping he would alight on it.
Instead he would land on the very top of the stepladder every time.
He would again take off flying weakly to another tree and resting,
but would return to the top of the stepladder calling to the other bird.

N. P. SHOLAR-HAND-FEEDING PURPLE MARTINS
I opened the cage door and released the other martin and it did as the
other one, making first one attempt after another to land on
the leaves but of course it could not hold on. I watched them carefully
every chance I could get and they remained in the area all the time.
They did not know how to secure their own food and since I was
their adopted mama they had learned to know that when I was around
they could expect to get food. After they had been without food most
of the afternoon one came down to the stepladder and I climbed up
and began feeding it. It wasn't long before the other one came down
for the same treatment. After feeding they would take off and fly
weakly around and finally both landed on a high pole that I have in
the yard with a martin house on top. The pole is 32 feet high. They
soon learned that this was a much better place to perch than on the
leaves. They also learned always to come down to the top of the step-
ladder for food. Late in the afternoon they were fed very heavily.
They took off in a very weak flying manner and they soon were out of
hearing and sight. They did not come back that night. Early the
next morning just at sunrise I heard what I thought was one of the
martins and went out to see. Sure enough both were sitting on top of
the stepladder flapping their wings as young birds do wanting something
to eat. They saw me coming and flew to me circling my head and
going back to the top of the stepladder. I again fed them and they ate
a hearty meal. This being Sunday I spent most of the day feeding the
martins on their perch. Their flight became more powerful and
skilful. For the next two weeks the martins would fly higher and
higher and would sail in a most graceful manner, then swoop down
and go back up to a very high altitude It seemed just impossible that
those birds that I could barely see would come down to me and
recognize me. At the top of their flight they would fold their wings
and drop very rapidly towards the vicinity of our home and would
alight first on the high pole and then come down to the top of the
stepladder. During all this time I only saw one of them take an
insect on the wing. Each evening they would go away but would be
back the next morning. This had become home to them and my plan
was working as I had hoped.
After the second week they were flying farther and farther away and
remaining away as much as three or four hours. Then they would
return bringing some martin friends with them. This was also part of
the hoped for plan. Soon after they brought back the visiting martins
I noticed that they were not as hungry and they must have learned
from their visiting friends how to catch their food on the wing. The
closest pond of water is a quarter of a mile from our place so they must
have learned also how to get a drink. When the visiting martins would
leave our vicinity my two decoys would remain.
This is the last week of August, 1966, and my two martins have now

listening to see if the two hand-reared martins know where home is,
and we are hoping after 18 years to get Purple Martins to take up
residence with us. If this does not occur I will next year again take

By Dr. Heinz-Georg Klos (Director, Berlin Zoological Gardens,
Germany)
The famous Berlin crane collection consisting of seven species has
been increased by a pair of the rare African Wattled Cranes ( Bugeranus
carunculatus) . These wonderful birds are very seldom seen in Zoological
Gardens and they were represented here for the last time fifty-five
years ago. Also from Africa we got a pair of the nice White-quilled
Bustards ( Afrotis afra afraoides) and a pair of Crested Bustards ( Lophotis
r. ruficrista). As we succeeded in breeding the Great Bustard {Otis
tarda) last year there is some hope that also these African species will
breed one day. From a German aviculturist living in Manila we got
among other birds two Scale-feathered Cuckoos (. Phoenicophaeus
cummingi), a species which to our knowledge never before had come to
Germany, and two young Calaos ( Buceros hydrocorax). Further we
obtained two White-crested Hornbills ( Berenicornis comatus) from
Borneo. The first specimen of this species to be exhibited in Europe
was the famous " Marylin " which came to us as a gift from Mrs.
Barbara Harrisson in 1961. It has lived here for four years.
Among the most outstanding events of the last months we have to
mention a shipment from Dr. Sten Bergman, Sweden, consisting of
a pair of Twelve-wired Birds of Paradise ( Seleucides ignotus), a male
Lesser Bird of Paradise ( Paradisaea minor ) and two female King Birds
of Paradise ( Cicinnurus regius) which had hatched in Dr. Bergman's
home. Everybody who knows how difficult it is to get Birds of Paradise
nowadays will understand that we are extremely grateful to the famous
Swedish zoologist and that we appreciate very much his generosity.
Breeding has been most successful in spite of the bad weather
conditions. In our Flamingo colony three European and one Chilean
Flamingo hatched and were raised successfully. Our Rheas produced
21 young ones. A rare event was the very difficult hand-rearing of a
Red-cheeked Ibis ( Geronticus eremita) (hatched in an incubator) whose
parents originate from Basel Zoo. Among other hatchings we only
mention the following: 11 Green Peafowl, 12 Ocellated Turkeys,

Well over one hundred Members of the Avicultural Society and
guests came on a visit to the Zoo on 29th June. For many of them it was
the first time they had seen the new Temperate Bird House (Avicul-
tural Magazine, Vol. 71, No. 5, page 154), which had not been
opened at the time of their last visit in June, 1965. Of course the Tropical
House was a big attraction and members who had visited the building
last year were impressed by the rapid growth of the plants--the
Banana tree is now nearly up to the 40-ft. apex of the roof.
Since the Avicultural visit we have been busy re-labelling the
Temperate Bird House. Previously lists of the birds at liberty with
their country of origin had been displayed in various parts of the
building. The new system provides easy identification of the twenty-
eight species at liberty within the confines of the building. Each label
gives common and Latin names and distribution area of each species
together with a coloured illustration of every bird. The labels printed
on cardboard and painted on in poster paint are covered with trans-
parent fablon and slotted into a board. The advantage of this system
is that the interested members of the public are able to identify each
species at a glance and birds which are transferred can easily have
their label removed from the board.
A number of new birds have arrived since members visited the Zoo.
Two Grey-winged Trumpeters have been placed in an aviary in the
Temperate Bird House. A pair of Red-headed Buntings have been
released within the confines of the Temperate Bird House. Two very
interesting species of doves were presented to us in a consignment from
South America. Four Rufous Doves (Columba cayennensis cayennensis)
and three Grey Ground Doves (Columbigallina passerina griseolo)
arrived--both these species are little larger than a sparrow and very
attractive indeed.
Arrivals since the last issue of the Avicultural Magazine include

among others : Chilean Flamingos, Whooper Swan, Laysan Teal,
American and European Wigeon, Satin Bower Bird, Demoiselle
Cranes, Cinereous Vultures, Scarlet Gocks-of-the-Rock, Yellow-tailed,
Red-tailed, and White-tailed Black Cockatoos, Hummingbirds, and
Red-billed Toucans.
A number of birds have hatched and reared young but these will be
summarized later in the year.

Through the kind co-operation of the Wildfowl Trust, two specimens
of Phoenicoparrus andinus , the Andean Flamingo, have been received.
These represent a genus not previously in the collection.
A new subspecies is the Laysan Duck [Anas platyrhynchos laysanensis ),
a pair, bred at Slimbridge, being received in exchange. In 1923 there
were thought to be only fourteen specimens left on Laysan, but the
number had increased to thirty-three by 1950. In 1958 a pair was
received at Slimbridge from the United States Fish and Wildlife
Service and many have been bred in captivity in the United States, at
Slimbridge, and elsewhere.
A number of interesting birds have been received in exchange from
Dr. C. Fernando Costa's collection at Estoril. These include two
Black-bellied Sandgrouse (. Pterocles orientalis orientalis ), a Yellow-
shouldered Parrot ( Amazona barbadensis ), a Mealy Parrot (A. farinosa),
a Ruppell's Parrot ( Poicephala ruppelli ), some tanagers including the
Festive (T. cyanocephala) and an Azure-winged Magpie ( Cyanopica cyana
cooki). Two Ross's Turacos ( Musophaga violacea rossae ) have been
presented by Mr. A. V. Marques ; a Great-billed or Black-tipped
Crested Turaco [T. macrorhynchus) has also been presented.
Birds bred in the Gardens include Barnacle Geese, Tonkinese
Junglefowl, Great Black-backed and Herring Gulls, Princess of Wales's
Parrakeets, two Great and a Spotted Eagle-Owl. A Swainson's X
Edwards's Lorikeet died in the nest after several weeks. A Reeve
laid two eggs in long grass in the Waders' Aviary, but they were
somehow broken.

W. P. Macveigh, Penang, Malaysia, has a problem. He writes :
" I would be glad of any advice on the hand-rearing of Fruit Doves of
the genus Ptilinopus. The problem is not to get them to feed when they
are young--that is easy--but they refuse to take food on their own
when adult and have to be hand fed ! "

Dr. John Berry has devoted many years to the experimental breeding
of geese. In a recent letter he writes : " The geese at Tayfield were
badly beaten up by a gang of hooligans on Sunday afternoon, 22nd
May. They stoned the nests and killed at least eleven adults and almost
all the goslings. Many geese flew away and a month later most of them
are still absent."

In Bokmakierie , June, 1966, there is a photograph and note by R. A.
Jubb, on a pair of Yellow-billed Duck (Anas undulata). The interesting
point about these birds is that they were deposited at Scott's Farm,
Grahamstown, Cape, in 1917. These ducks are now nearly fifty years
old : they are in good health although nearly blind. Scott's Farm has
been in the Blackbeard family for over a century and for the past fifty
years Miss Gladys Blackbeard has maintained it as a sanctuary for
displaced and maimed creatures.

Some readers may recollect that I have a more than passing interest
in the Red-faced Lovebird. Consequently, I am always especially
pleased to record any breeding of this somewhat unpredictable little
parrot. J. V. Rouillard has sent me a colour transparency of a young
one reared last year in his aviary at Stanger, Natal. It left the nest in
July (in the middle of winter) fully fledged but unable to fly, and during
the first ten days all its tail-feathers were shed. It unfortunately died
in November. It never acquired the power of flight but appeared
quite fit and crawled all over the aviary, just making very short,
descending flights now and again.

Ben Heddle, King Island, Tasmania, has been particularly successful
in breeding Long-billed Corella X Galah hybrids. In Great Britain we
more usually refer to them as Slender-billed Kakatoe tenuirostris and
Roseate K. roseicapilla Cockatoos. The pair nested in a 12 J gallon petrol
drum nailed on to a post, with the open end facing upwards. In 1964,
three young were hatched and reared, one male (soon killed by the
male parent) and two females ; 1965, again three were hatched and
reared. Hybrids of this parentage were bred in the Adelaide Zoo about
1944, but I am not certain which was the male parent : and F. Fahey,
Northmead, N.S.W., had a hybrid " Corella (short-faced) X Galah "
in his possession in 1950 or perhaps earlier.

Fom time to time we read of bizarre friendships between birds.
Such an one is blossoming in Mrs. Grace Wheatley's sub-tropical
bird-room. Mrs. Wheatley writes : "I love breeding Chinese Quail.
My latest cock killed his hen and as I was annoyed I didn't rush off
to replace her. Ah ! I thought, now I shall have to endure the awful
mournful noise the cock makes ! But no, not a sound. On investigation
I found that he had made great friends with a wee hen Yellow-breasted
Waxbill. He brings her treasures to eat and at night she crouches
under his wing. He has absolutely adopted her, and her mate perches
disconsolately over their heads. She is, of course, almost invisible
beside him. I have never seen anything so quaint in all my years of
keeping and breeding tropical birds."

The late J. C. Laid lay, of " The Care and Propagation of Ornamental
Waterfowl " fame, had an ambition to see the Mandarin Duck estab-
lished on the Tay and form a colony as they have done at Virginia
Water, Surrey. It is pleasing to hear from Mrs. Eve Laidlay that she is
doing everything possible to further the project. Mrs. Laidlay writes :
"In February there were seventeen full-winged Mandarin on the
River. They always come to our ponds to feed and this year three
full-winged ducks laid in the boxes in the garden rather than in the
eighteen or so high boxes in neighbouring trees. I have a total of
76 Mandarin on our half-acre plot ! And I look forward to seeing them
all in colour. A Maned Goose was allowed to hatch and has been an
excellent mother to a very healthy, independant Mandarin, now two
weeks old. They seem pretty hardy despite torrential and incessant

G. Eickert, Redcastle, Victoria, has bred four Rosella X Red-
rumped Parrakeet hybrids, described as " similar to a Murray Rosella
with crimson forehead and red rumps ". This is a sufficiently unusual
cross to warrant the event being recorded.
It was apparently first obtained in England in 1881, two reared, and
1882, three reared. The breeder was an unidentified gentleman who
signed his reports " Vicar ". Success of varying degree was obtained at
the London Zoo in 1947-49 : in 1903 two hybrids were exhibited on

George Auld, Blacksmiths, N.S.W., made something of a speciality of
this cross. In the 1944-45 season he bred five hybrids, and in the
1 945-46 fourteen, six Rosella X Red-rumped (two from each of three
nests) and eight Red-rumped X Rosella (two nests of four each). The
next season the Red-rumped X Rosella mating was again used and
young reared, the reverse cross being dropped because of the inferior
colour of the youngsters.
It was then decided to test the fertility of the hybrids and the nicest
hybrid cock was mated to a hen Many-coloured--two young were
reared : " In build and general colour they were mainly Many-coloured
with distinct evidence of the Redrump, but no trace of Rosella."

"For the study of British and Foreign Birds in freedom and captivity."
During the seventy years that have passed since the foundation of the
Society the membership has included many distinguished aviculturists,
ornithologists and field-naturalists. But how many members have made
a sustained study of British birds in captivity and by their breeding
made a worthwhile contribution to ornithological knowledge? It
would seem regrettably few.
Pre-eminent was W, E, Teschemaker who, while resident in Devon,

was awarded no less than twenty-four of the Society's Medals for a first
breeding, during 1905-13. This number included such British species
as Hedge Sparrow (1906), Blackcap (1909), Hawfinch (1911) and
Whinchat (1912). Then there were J. L. Bonhote, E. G. B. Meade-
Waldo and W. H. St. Quintin, V. A. V. Carr who in 1938 bred the
Ring Ouzel, and R. C. Tout.
Amongst the greats of the present day must be included A. H. Scott
who over a long period has bred some 2,500 British birds, including
over 1,000 abnormally-coloured Greenfinches and Sparrows : F. C.
Astles who seems to make the breeding of rare British species almost
a matter of course : T. S. Thomson with a full two acres under netting,
mainly devoted to British birds : and Frank Meaden, of Waxwing fame.
Who else might be included in this select number ?

One hundred and thirty members and guests attended the Tenth
Annual Lunch, at the invitation of the Chairman and Council of the
North of England Zoological Society, through the Director-Secretary
Mr. G. S. Mottershead, at the Zoological Gardens, Chester, on
29th June, 1966. Miss Geraldine Russell Allen, Chairman of the
North of England Zoological Society, presided at the lunch and
welcomed the visitors, and the Rev. Canon J. R. Lowe, the senior
member of our Society present, thanked the Chairman and Council on
behalf of our members. The weather was again perfect and the gardens
were just at their very best. It is always pleasing to remember that
whereas Mr. Mottershead is in the very forefront of directors of
zoological gardens he is still, as always, an aviculturist at heart. This
is evidenced by the unremitting care bestowed on the birds themselves
and to their housing under the most favourable conditions possible.
Naturally, the Temperate Bird House, which had not been opened
at the time of the last visit, and the Tropical House, now more mature,
were the main focus of attention.
The motto of the Chester Zoo is " Always building ", symbolized
by the Beaver. In recognition of her many years devoted service to the
Zoo the Hon. Secretary informally presented Mrs. Mottershead with
a gold brooch in the form of a Beaver, as " a token of the admiration
and affection of the Avicultural Society ". It should perhaps be
mentioned that the brooch was specially made in Canada through
the good offices of Mr. Gerald T. lies, Managing Director, Zoological
Society of Montreal.
Once again I have to repeat what I have said on so many previous
occasions. The warmest thanks of all members present are accorded to
Mr. and Mrs. G. S. Mottershead, Mr. and Mrs. G. F. Williams, Miss
A. L. Howard, and indeed the entire staff, for their untiring efforts to
make the visitors welcome and so make their visit so very enjoyable
and memorable. A. A. P.

THE LIVING AIR. The Memoirs of an Ornithologist. By Jean
Delacour. Published by Country Life, Ltd. London, 1966.
Price 45J. net.
A small boy of three years old, in a blue and white striped dressing-
gown was recovering from a long illness--beside his bed was a box in
which lived a white, downy chick, his greatest treasure. He followed
every one of its movements and reactions, and his eyes seldom wandered
from it. Later the chick grew up to be a large, bearded, white hen with
black tail and neck ; it also became historical, for it was the first bird
kept by the leading aviculturist of our time.
Jean Delacour was not only a born naturalist but a born aviculturist
and by the age of ten had established a considerable collection of birds.
This he had to do on his own efforts which included the amassing of the
necessary wealth to buy birds and plants which he achieved by being
top of his class at school and thus gaining a money award from his
mother.
With his great knowledge and love of plants, and deep appreciation
of beauty, he was well equipped to know how to house and show birds
to the best advantage and his descriptions of his hopes and despair
about his birds will raise a kindred feeling in the hearts of all avicul-
turists.
His indomitable courage and philosophy made it possible for him to
build up the collection at Cleres after the famous collection at Villers-
Bretonneux had been destroyed in the First World War and, yet again, to
re-establish the collection at Cleres destroyed in the Second World War.
Monsieur Delacour's accounts of his travels to all parts of the globe
are fascinating and give a vivid picture of these remote and interesting
places. His links with England are very close and his autobiography
is also an account of aviculture and aviculturists during the last
60 years.
This book, charmingly written, with the sense of humour which
characterizes our illustrious Vice-President, is one that can be read
again and again with undiminished interest and pleasure.

BIRDS IN COLOUR. Illustrated by Karl Aage Tinggard, with
description by Bruce Campbell. Blandford Press, London, 1966.
Price 21s.
The claims made for this book in the " blurb " on the jacket and the
foreword are that the beautiful paintings (of 256 British species) will
both make it a welcome addition to the library of the experienced
bird-addict and also enable beginners to recognize the birds they see.

Even in our modern ultra-conformist society we are not (yet) all
expected to have identical responses where art and beauty are con-
cerned, so the fact that most of the illustrations did not thrill me
aesthetically is no condemnation of them. Those who buy a book for
the beauty of its illustrations would, obviously, be fools if they allowed
themselves to be influenced by any other person's criteria of beauty.
The case is different with regard to the use of the illustrations for
identification purposes. Here a fault is that, in many cases (e.g. Linnet,
Brambling, Turnstone), only the adult male in full breeding plumage
is shown ; the one plumage phase that a raw beginner could identify
without much trouble from a written description ! No doubt modern
techniques of colour reproduction and not the artist are responsible
for the black-backed Mistle Thrush, the Willow Warbler with bright
yellow underparts, and a few others of like ilk, but whatever the cause
they detract from the book's value to the beginner. In some species
(e.g. Nuthatch, Bullfinch) the Scandinavian rather than the British
forms appear to have been depicted and the long-standing bird-artists'
convention that doves of the genus Streptopelia have a powdery white
cere like that of some Columba species is rigidly adhered to. The
picture of the Collared Dove, as it appears in my review copy, manages
to combine the diagnostic features of two other species, the black facial
streak and dark brown eye of Streptopelia capicola and the pale creamy
colouration of the domestic Barbary Dove, S. " risoria
The black-and-white sketches of birds of prey in flight, in similar
style to those of the well-known " Peterson Field Guide ", are likely to
be of real help in the field. The text is adequate so far as it goes and
indeed implies one real addition to ornithological knowledge, that the
Turtledove dust bathes (p. 195). The reviewer feels that this discovery
should have been recorded, with all the evidence, in some journal such
as British Birds rather than just in a " throw away " line in a book of
this nature.

The wide, bare sand beaches of eastern North America, from southern
Saskatchewan to North Carolina and inland to northwestern Indiana
are the summer homes and breeding grounds of the Piping Plover
(&lt;Charadrius melodus). The ventriloquial " peep-lo " call helps little in
locating this pale, little bird as it runs along the shore or leaps lightly
into the air to skim the crest of a breaker. Once nearly exterminated,
it is now returning as a breeding species along the New Jersey coast.
The busy resorts with their hordes of bathers and feral cats and dogs
comprise its major enemies today.
The very survival of the Piping Plover depends on the effectiveness
of its protective colouration and the locating of its nest. The nest
is usually a shallow hole, several of which are made by the male and
one is selected by the female. The site is usually on the bare beach,
among sparse beach grass, or at the base of a low sand dune. It was
only with a great deal of difficulty that John Quinn secured the eggs of
this species. The first nest was rather unusual in that it was located on
the seaward side of a dune, concealed in dune grass. The second nest
was in a more conventional location on the open beach. In both cases
the adults stole away from the nests as they were approached and
came back to one side to distract the intruder. The locations of the
nests were learned by retiring and watching the parents with a spotting
scope until they returned to their nests. Each nest contained four,
buffy, speckled eggs which were almost invisible against the bits of
shell and pebbles that lined the edges of the cavity.
The birds can be found on the beaches from late March to late
October, but the majority of the breeders come here in April and May
and have departed by the middle of August. The nests from which the
eggs were obtained were located on 18th June and appeared to be
quite fresh. Two eggs were taken from each nest and placed in
a still-air incubator. The temperature was 99-4* F.; and because

of previous problems of the membrane drying out, the decision was
made to keep the humidity at 78 per cent. The eggs were turned
twice a day, and in seventeen days the first egg began to pip. All four
of the eggs hatched within 10 hours of the first one. Three of the
young birds appeared to be in very fine health, but the fourth was
rather weak and, much to our regret, died 3 days later.
The four chicks were put in a small brooder which was approximately
93 0 F. for the first week ; the temperature was then reduced to between
85* and 89* F. The development of the chicks seemed to indicate that
only enough heat was needed to avoid chilling them, as they spent
most of their time at the edges of the brooder where the temperature
was as low as 8o* F.
After twenty-four hours a mixture of Purina F and M, chopped egg
yolk and the smallest mealworms available was fed. They picked at
the moving worms very readily and were soon eating the entire mixture.
Because of the variety of insects, crustaceans, molluscs, and other small,
marine animals and their eggs which serve as natural food for the
Piping Plover in the wild, a wide choice of food was also offered the
captive chicks. Large mealworms were eaten when the birds were
3 days old, and other insect life such as aquatic tubifex worms and
roaches were fed with success.
This species of plover is an extremely active bird in captivity ; how-
ever, it should do very well if provided with abundant room and a
variety of food. The problem of toe picking was experienced at about
one week, but was alleviated at once with the increase of live food.
The birds developed quite rapidly, but all three of them were slow to
fly which could likely be accounted for by the lack of flight room.
Very little has been published on the breeding of shore birds in
captivity, and we would be very interested in corresponding with
anyone who has had experience with the propagating of any of the
species.
We feel that as civilization advances all over the world, shore birds
will suffer particularly ; and so the propagation of this family in
captivity may mean the difference of life and death for many species.
PS.--The Plovers are now adult, or nearly so, and will be given to
the Philadelphia Zoo (Mr. John Griswold).

(.Aegithalos caudatus)
By W. Painter (Farnham, Surrey, England)
During the last winter I received a pair of Long-tailed Tits, Aegithalos
caudatus , from the collection of a recently deceased aviculturist. During
the cold weather I housed them in an 8 feet by 6 feet bird room. This
faced south and was heated by a paraffin stove to a temperature of
about 45 degrees Fahrenheit. In spring they were transferred to an
outdoor aviary at the end of the garden. This was an all-wire structure,
9 feet by 16 feet, built against and partly under a stand of silver birch
trees, with a small stream just beyond it. The aviary itself was very
heavily planted with shrubs and creepers.
The Long-tailed Tits shared the aviary with a hen Lesser White-
throat, a cock Black Redstart, and a pair of Yellow Wagtails which
nested and reared five young during the breeding season. Relations
between these birds seemed quite amicable. The birds were fed on
" Avi-vite " soft-food, blowfly maggots, and occasional grated cheese.
In addition the vegetation in and around the aviary provided a number
of live insects.
The tits kept together and the cock was heard at times to utter a
quiet warbling song and seen performing a display, puffing out his
feathers and hopping sideways along a perch above that on which the
hen was sitting. They were visited almost daily by a wild cock that
would come and perch on the aviary, and this seemed to stimulate the
breeding behaviour of the aviary pair.
In the hope that they would try to breed, the birds were supplied
with nest-material consisting of kapok, moss, white cat's fur, lichen, and
spider's web. They chose a nest-site in a berberis shrub with many
slender thorny stems, about three feet from the ground ; the site being
apparently selected by the male, performing his fluffed display as he
did so.
Nest-building began in early May but the rate of progress appeared
to be governed by the amount of spiders' webs available for binding it.
Considerable difficulty was experienced in providing sufficient of this
and as a result the nest was not complete until late May. Fresh spiders'
webs, which were mostly found low in hedgerows, were collected on
a piece of wire bent into a loop at the end, and these were placed on
the end of a perch, where the birds collected them into small balls and
added them to the structure. Cobwebs were collected from the corners
of sheds and also offered, but the birds preferred the fresh ones when
available. Lichen was offered on pieces of bark and the birds tore off
flakes and attempted to stick them to the outside of the nest, the scarcity
of spiders' webs making this a little difficult. At first the birds appeared

to use the nest merely for roosting and it was not until early June that
it became apparent that one of the birds was on the nest for most of the
time, presumably incubating.
I was reluctant to examine the nest and upset the pair and possibly
damage the structure, and so little precise data is available. About
mid-June fragments of egg-shell were found in the aviary, indicating
that hatching had occurred. For about five days after this one bird
was usually on the nest while the other continually searched the
vegetation for insects. After about five days both adults shared the
task of food collecting. At this period Wood Ant pupae were added to
their diet, and it was noted that they were taking any insects that could
be found, especially aphis. In early July a single young one was at
last seen out of the nest, accompanying its parents. An examination of
the now empty nest revealed no evidence of the existence of either
other eggs or young.
As described, W. Painter has bred the Long-tailed Tit Aegithalos
caudatus. It is believed that this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this
species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communi-
cate at once with the Hon. Secretary.

Details of Individuals and Nesting
The pair of birds concerned (pair 44 A ") was purchased on 12th May,
1964. After a brief period of acclimatization they were released into an
outside flight. During June the hen went into moult and 1964 passed
without interest. In April, 1965, they were released into a planted
aviary 12 feet by 8 feet by 10 feet, the cock displayed to the hen and
often vigorously chased her. On 3rd June a very neatly woven nest of
grasses, lined with fine roots, was found in a canary nest-cup, which
had been nailed to a support beam. No eggs were laid and a cock
St. Helena Waxbill (Estrilda astrild ) filled it with green privet leaves.
A second pair of Red-Crested Finches (pair 44 B ") was purchased
on 14th June and housed in an adjoining aviary. The two pairs could
see each other and the cocks spent a good deal of time in competitive
display and song. Apart from hen-chasing by both cocks, there was
no other 44 nesting " activity in 1965.
Pair 44 A " was released into the 12 foot by 8 foot aviary on 14th May,

1966, which they shared with Talpacoti Doves (Columbigallina talpacoti),
Harlequin Quail ( Coturnix delegorguei) , Quail Finches ( Ortygospiza
articollis ), Pin-tailed Nonpareils ( Erthyura prasina ) and Pearl-headed
Silverbills ( Odontospiza caniceps ), one pair of each species. " Pair B "
were kept out of visual and vocal contact, as I feared the competitive
display and song might distract them, so all further comment will refer
to pair " A ".
Among the various nesting receptacles in the aviary, was a roughly
fashioned cup of J-inch wire mesh. This was fixed in a small tree about
4 feet above ground, some leafy twigs were stuck around the rim
forming a screen, and a small amount of dried grass pushed into the
" cup 55 . The hen flew to this site on 4th June with a grass stem, by
the 6th a nest of grass neatly lined with upholsterer's fibre had been
finished. An egg was laid on the 15th, a second on the 16th and the hen
commenced incubation. The nest was examined on the 23rd and there
were three eggs. During incubation the cock fed the hen, although
she left the nest to chase other birds from the site and to feed.
On the morning of the 27th there were three young birds in the nest,
which were probably hatched the day before. They were dark grey in
colour and showed traces of greyish white nestling down. The hen
brooded them closely, the cock flying to the nest with earwigs, flies and
gentles. Mealworms and " sluis " were placed in the feeding site the
following day. The mealworms were given to the young immediately,
and remained the preferred live food. From this time the hen brooded
the young night and early morning. Both parents were busy and atten-
tive " feeders ", the chicks showed a yellow edged pinkish red gape
when " begging ". Nest sanitation was carried out by the hen, in most
cases droppings carried from the nest were eaten.
One youngster left the nest on the evening of 5th July. It was pouring
with rain, the chick was well feathered and half flapped, half hopped,
around the aviary. The hen was very bold, flying around my head.
An attempt was made to replace the chick in the nest, (a forlorn hope),
it scrambled out again immediately. To my surprise it was alive the
next morning, looked dry and active and was preening in a very
" adult " fashion.
A second chick left the nest on the 7th, the hen was continually chasing
away the Harlequin Quail and Quail Finches from her chicks on the
ground. She also tried, usually without success, to coax them to perch
above ground by holding a mealworm in her beak, flying to the chick
and as soon as it " begged " she hopped above ground by clinging to
the aviary netting or a twig. If the chick followed she would go a
little higher, often the chick would follow until 4 or 5 feet above the
ground then flap down ; the hen would then repeat this coaxing with
great persistence. The second youngster died on the 8th, the third left the
nest on the 9th and died the same day. Both parents continued to guard

and feed the survivor, who seemed to be very backward in perching
and flying.
The same nest was relined with upholsterer's fibre on the 19th and an
egg was laid on the 21st, incubation commenced at once and a second
egg was laid on the 23rd. During incubation the cock fed the youngster
of the first clutch and the hen. He began to feed the chick on seed on the
25th and the youngster was feeding itself on the 27th. It was now like the
hen except for lack of vinous colouration on rump etc. One chick of the
second clutch hatched on 1st August. The remaining egg was " clear ".
I had to go away for two weeks on the 3rd, and the chick of the first clutch
was dead that morning. It was 36 days old and independent of its parents,
but its movements had been unco-ordinated since it was about 14 days
old. The solitary chick of the second clutch showed the same gape colour,
nestling down etc. as the first brood. All appeared well so I left the
birds in charge of a friend, hoping for better luck with the second
" round ".
Unfortunately I found the body of this chick when I returned home,
and estimated its age to be about 14 days. The five eggs laid were
unmarked white ovals rather attenuated towards the small end. Only
one egg was measured, the " clear " in the second clutch which was
20-2 by 14'imm. Incubation period for both clutches was approxi-
mately 11 days.
Food
Mixed millets, small canary, " wild " seed, maw, millet sprays and
soaked seed are always available, plus seeding grasses, powdered
cuttlefish, oystershell etc. Maggots, whiteworm and any live food
available are given ad-lib. Millet and small canary form the basic seed
diet of the adults. Millet sprays, seeding grasses are taken with relish.
Wild seed is picked over, maw is ignored, all live food is favoured
except whiteworm. There is little doubt that failure to rear the young
was due to dietary deficiency. When the chicks left the nest I dusted
maggots and mealworms with P.Y.M. and gave Bemax mixed with
water. Although the adults ate the Bemax, the young appeared to be
given nothing but live food, the one exception was the first chick
hatched which was fed seed by the cock when it was about 28 days old.
Voice
A loud " Thik-tic " is the most often heard note from both sexes.
When the aviary is entered or they have young out of the nest, a
" flatter " sounding " Thik-tac " is given. The cock has a harsh
" Zurr-zurr ", and a series of quiet chirruping notes which are always
given from cover. These notes remind me of a very subdued and

General Characteristics and Behaviour
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995047027027027" page_id="56366437"  page_num="152" year="" vol="">
C. cristatus is an active bird with strong flight; both pairs have been
wintered without heat in a dry draught-free shelter with artificial light
provided till 9 p.m. Their behaviour is generally aggressive, even
without being in " breeding condition " both sexes are inclined to
keep smaller birds on the move. However, in my limited aviary space,
this could be said of many birds, some of which are not " territorial ".
Perhaps to get a true picture two pairs would have to be kept in a large
" wilderness " aviary.
A good deal of time is spent on, or near, the ground, locomotion on
the ground is always by hopping. When a gentle or any live food is
taken they fly to a low perch in cover to eat it. The tail is often cocked
when alighting on a perch at a similar angle to that of the Blackbird,
it is frequently cocked when hopping on the ground.
The display of the male bird is vigorous, the " object " seems to be
to " drive " the hen to the ground. On several occasions the cock has
struck the hen during this " driving " or " chasing ", although in such
a state of excitement this could well be accidental. When the hen
reaches the ground she stands facing the cock as he alights. His crest
is erected and fanned out, the body posture is erect with the neck
stretched. Head and neck are swung from side to side with a rhythmic
motion, he sings during this display period. The hen keeps facing the
cock and breaks " contact " by flying away, sometimes the cock
resumes the " chase ". This display pattern was the same for both
pairs. Copulation has been witnessed twice only, in both cases the hen
was perched.
Once the hen was seen lying prone, with beak, head, body, and tail,
flat on the ground and with wings half open. (This is difficult to
describe, but perhaps the nearest one can get would be to say it
resembled a " flat " sun bathing posture.) The cock flew down and
alighted on the rump of the hen with wings beating, then flew away,
the hen following. He was singing and the crest was erected and
fanned as he touched the hen's rump. It would appear that the hen's
posture was an unusual one for a passerine to adopt.
When the hen left the nest during incubation the cock would fly to
her and give an open beak upright posture, this occurred every time
the hen was seen to leave the nest and was only given when the hen
was perched.

BREEDING THE WHEATEAR
(Oenanthe 0. oenanthe (L.))

During the spring of 1965 a pair of Wheatears, originally obtained
from Spain, bred in one of the small aviaries in the Norfolk Wildlife
Park. The enclosure is constructed of half-inch mesh wire-netting on
pressure creosoted timber, and measures 10 feet wide, 12 feet deep and
7 feet high. The inside has been landscaped, a small turf-covered bank
running down one side and across the back, and furnished with pieces
of rock, a tree stump and growing shrubs. An artificial rabbit-burrow
was constructed, running back into the bank, to complete as nearly
as possible a replica of typical Wheatear habitat. The burrow consists
of a bottomless box, two feet long and six inches square, buried in the
ground. One end is left open and a removable lid placed over the far
end above the nest chamber. The burrow runs uphill to prevent
flooding in wet weather.
Food in the form of insectivorous mixture, live maggots and meal-
worms is given in a shallow dish inside a small natural looking cave
built of stone, thus remaining dry in all weathers.
The adults were introduced to the aviary in April 1965, the hen
being put out two weeks before the cock to give her time to settle and
to prevent the cock becoming aggressive.
The hen was first missed on 30th May and apparently began to
incubate on that date. On 15th June the cover over the top of the nest
chamber was removed when the female was out feeding in the evening.
Hatching had started and the nest contained two chicks and three
eggs. On 24th June one chick was found dead outside the nest-burrow
with wounds on its back and head. It had apparently been pulled
out and attacked by one or both parents. There was no sign of the
other chick.
Early in July the cock died, but the hen was already incubating her
second clutch for they hatched on 15th July. A fortnight later two

chicks were coming to the entrance of the burrow to beg for food. The
hen reared them without trouble until they were able to fend for
themselves.
Early this year (1966) the same adult hen was put in the aviary and
two weeks later the young male bred last year joined her.
Towards the end of May the female was observed on several
occasions carrying dead grass and roots into the burrow and on
4th June she began to incubate a clutch of five eggs. They apparently
hatched on 19th June and from then on both adult birds were seen
to take food to the young, although the hen did the bulk of the feeding.
For the first week in addition to their normal food, chopped mealworms
were provided in a separate dish.
On 6th July the nest was examined and found to contain two fully
feathered chicks both of which showed signs of crippled feet, although
they were able to run when placed on the ground. Young Wheatears
in the wild run out of their nest-burrows from the age of ten days
onwards to meet the adults returning with food. This behaviour had
never been seen in the captive birds, possibly on account of members
of the public so often looking at them, so it was decided to shut them
out of their burrow for a few hours each day, increasing the period
gradually. At the end of a week one chick was perching quite normally
and showed no sign of any deformity. The other remained crippled in
one foot and died some weeks later. The healthy chick turned out to be
a female and was separated from its parents in late September.
As described by Philip Wayre, the Wheatear Oenanthe oenanthe has
been bred at the Norfolk Wildlife Park. It is believed that this may be
a first success.

(Trichoglossus haematod mas send)
By W. H. Brown (Tonbridge, Kent, England)
On 17th September, 1965, I received from Dr. Ken Searle of
Hong Kong, a beautiful pair of lorikeets. These were identified as
Massena's Lorikeets which I will now describe.
They are approximately 10 inches in length and I have been unable
to find any difference between the sexes. The facial areas are blue, as
are the crown and the forehead, followed by a dull purple band and a
bright yellow-green nuchal collar. The throat is also a deep, dull purple
and the breast is a brilliant red. Each of the breast feathers is scaled
with a rich, dark blue giving a striped effect. The abdomen is green
with yellow markings, and the thighs and legs are green and yellow
striped. The bill of the adult is orange. Altogether a really lovely bird.
On opening the box they had travelled in I found that the hen had laid
two eggs which seemed a pretty good start, but these I disposed of at once.
The birds were kept in a temperature-controlled room for a month
with the temperature being brought down a little every day. I then
put them into one of my outdoor flights, which measures 12 feet
by 6 feet by 3 feet, with a house at the end, into which they were shut
every evening during the following winter. This flight and all of my
other outdoor flights are unheated.
They went right through the winter without a spot of trouble and
at one time were seen rolling around in the snow like puppies. A nest-
box measuring 18 inches by 9 inches by 9 inches, was put in the flight
in March and, of course, the birds were no longer shut in at night.
They were interested in the nest-box at once and the hen started
chewing up the old wood. I should perhaps mention at this point
that the method I use for filling the nest box is as follows :--first
the bottom of the nest-box is covered with perforated zinc sheet which
is kept in place by strong wire netting, this allows a great deal of the
liquid droppings to drain away, the bottom of the inside of the box
is then covered with 2 inches of activated carbon which helps to keep
the box " sweet " ; then I put in 2 inches of peat finished off with
4 inches of broken up rotten wood. This seems to do the trick.
On 19th March two eggs were seen and the hen seemed to be sitting
very tight. However, we then had a really frightful spell of bad cold
weather and she came off. The eggs were then removed. Two more
eggs were seen on 21st May ; though I can't be sure of the exact date
of laying, it was certainly within a day or so of this date.
The hen did not seem to be sitting all that tight and on 10th June
I opened the box to see if the eggs were still there and was both
delighted and surprised to find a very young chick which must have
hatched that very day.

From then on frequent inspections were made and the parents did not
mind at all and I had the pleasure of being able to show the chick
to Dr. Searle who was over in England at the time.
I put every type of food I could think of in the house, but the parents
used only their usual nectar mixture and a little canary seed.
The chick grew very well though much slower than parrakeets that
I have bred. It started to feather up quite well, but left the nest on
Tuesday, 9th August, with a great deal of nakedness. However, it
was able to fly very well and is at the time of this report i.e., 27th
September, fully feathered and of the same size as the parents. The
only difference is that on leaving the nest its bill was a very dark
brown which has now turned a dirty horn colour and the blue on the
facial areas is less bright.
The bird is now, of course, fully independent though is still in with
the parents. At the time of writing the hen is again sitting on two more
eggs so all looks well for some further youngsters.
The nectar mixture I use is as follows :--one teaspoon of honey, one
teaspoon of Horlicks and one teaspoon of Nestle's Full Cream Condensed
milk to six ounces of water.
I also have two beautiful Edwards's Lorikeets (Trichoglossus haematod
capistratus) about to leave the nest, but more of them later.
As described, W. H. Brown has bred Massena's Lorikeet Trichoglossus
haematod massena. It is believed that this may be a first success.

BIRD NOTES FROM CLERES--1966

The weather during the breeding season of 1966 has been practically
as bad as that of 1965 : almost continual cold and rain prevailed until
early in August, which was also abnormally cool if not quite so wet ;
only September was tolerably fine and dry. The result has been that
many species of birds, which need a warm climate during their nesting
season simply did not come into breeding condition and did not lay.
Others dropped only a few eggs--often infertile ones. The group of
birds particularly affected was that of the pigeons and doves, many
of which did not breed, or only late in the season. No rare ones nested
this year. Rheas were not very successful, one male only out of five
hatching successfully a brood of twelve, two of them white. We now
have six of the latter, but the four adults have proved to be all females.
A three-year-old pair of Ostriches, born at the Paris Zoo, are in
perfect condition and the female laid one egg.

Black and Black-necked Swans reared young, and also Orinoco geese
(4), Andean (9), Ruddy-headed (2), Blue-winged (3), Cereopsis (2).
Very few of the commoner geese were successful.
Our old pairs of Stanley Cranes hatched two broods ; but during
the last few years the young succumb to gape worms every time. We
shall have to try to rear them in a brooder. Incidentally, several
dozen of Stanley Cranes were offered for sale in Holland last spring.
We got three additional pairs of Blue Crown Cranes from Tanganyika.
A number of species of ducks have been reared, some by their parents,
none of very great rarity. Our Eiders breed regularly.
The aviary on running water for the smaller waterfowl proves to be
very suitable. We have there African Pygmy geese, Cotton, Hottentot,
Ringed, Laysan Teal and Bufheheads, as well as Spreos and Red-
headed Marsh Birds.
The Brush Turkeys insisted on building mounds close to public paths
and when they were fenced off, refused to work elsewhere. Therefore
no results followed.
Siamese Firebacks, Edwards's, Swinhoe's, Cheer, Hume's, Elliot's,
Grey Peacock Pheasants as well as Ceylon Junglefowl were reared ;
also Bourke's and a few other Parrakeets.
Some observations on the behaviour of certain birds may be worth
reporting :
A three-year-old Cereopsis male would never pair up with a female
of the same age, so that they had to be separated after more than a
year together. The same thing happened to Blue-winged geese. When
such antipathy is shown persistently the only remedy is to try other
pairings.
A pair of Tasmanian Water Hens, in this park, although friendly,
developed a craze for Screamers which they constantly followed, and
they did not attempt to nest. They have been removed to the garden
and now behave normally.
A pair of Black Spurwinged geese, sent by the Pretoria Zoo where
they were raised, first behaved normally ; but gradually the male
became interested in the Australian Magpie geese, to the point of
deserting his mate for them. The Spurwings were removed from the
park and they have now resumed their former attachment.
It is difficult to understand why birds of quite remote affinities
should behave in such a way, as they not infrequently do, when they have
practically unlimited space and mates of their own species available.
I have had the occasion of watching recently African Black Ducks
{Anas sparsa) on the lake. Their display is on the whole fairly different
from that of the true Mallards ; but the males are inclined to join the
latter and they perform completely the well-known " grunt-whistle ",
which is typical of the Mallard-Pintail-Teal group. I am not certain
that this display has been reported before.

By Dillon Ripley (Litchfield, Connecticut, U.S.A.)
Although I have been watching the turning of the seasons with our
waterfowl for thirty-five years now, the new calls, the new activities
each spring as the crescendo of behaviour patterns rises to beat upon
our senses like a vernal symphony never fail to bring a thrill. The
weekends when we rush back from Washington to Connecticut carry
us step by step forward into the heightening rhythms until the climax
comes in May when much of our daylight hours are consumed by
hunting for nests, or eagerly relating to each other ; " the Pinkfeet are
on a nest again," or c4 it does look as if the Moluccan Radjahs might do
something this time
Alas the Moluccan Radjahs prove to be gay deceivers as they have all
six years we have had them since bringing them back by air from New
Guinea. The harsh rattles of the female, the head dipping minuet of
the male lead once more to nothing. There is a brief renewal in the
autumn. The theme recurs again as if in an autumnal recessional. It
must be our climate. It is, perhaps, just too cold. Another pair of the
same group of eight birds that we brought back has nested happily
each year in the Caribbean Gardens in Florida to help to populate the
avicultural world with a goodly number of progeny.
So be it ; at least our Pinkfeet have nested twice now in the last two
years, each time on the same island within a foot or two of the pre-
ceding nest. The Chilean Bronze-wing Ducks, all fury and hellfire
descend regularly on the Pinkfeet, but although the big geese were
driven off the island bodily once or twice, they managed to hold their
nest, and hatch out young. In spite of all the fuss and feathers raised by
the Bronze-wings, their nests of large, brown poultry-sized eggs have
failed to hatch. Somehow the Bronze-wings seem to have " protested
too much When they got down to it, their eggs failed. Perhaps too
much incitement is in itself not adaptive ? Some ecologist-behaviourists
might agree.
This 1966 season, from about 475 eggs gathered, we have reared
about 150 birds. This rearing seems neither good nor bad, merely
average. As always, we failed to find some nests, especially of teal and
tree ducks which nest when the hay and weeds have become " jungley
In the late autumn we may find the nests long since abandoned, the
eggs conveying merely wistful speculations about possible owners. In
this past summer, although the total season was dry, June was wet, and
we lost a fair number of geese, six young Emperors alone, from
aspergillosis. Among the geese, two subspecies of Canada laid, as well as
Barnacle, Barhead, Pinkfeet, Whitefront, Emperor, Blue, both Snows,
Ross, Hawaiian Nene, and finally one mysterious nest, the ownership
of which seemed to fall between Black Brant and Redbreast. I made

the mistake of removing the first egg (something I had never done
before, but fighting and egg rolling had made me jumpy), and my
effort to substitute large duck eggs failed, as our superintendent
dourly assured me it would. No more small goose eggs were laid, and
the single egg failed to hatch.
Many full clutches of eggs taken from known parents, seem to hatch
badly under artificial incubation. No one appears to have a sensible
reason for this. Of a clutch of nine Green-wing Teal eggs we reared
only one. Of two nests of Falcated Teal, of sixteen eggs, we reared five.
Why should this be so ? On the other hand New Zealand Scaup
laid eight eggs, we hatched six and reared four. Two fully-grown
young in down simply dropped dead one day. One wishes year by
year, that the answers were apparent to these peculiar ratios of egg-
laying, hatching, and finally, successful rearing. Our own system is to
start eggs in an incubator, let them go for five days or so until the
embryo is beginning to become apparent, then place them under
incubating hens. At the very end of the incubation cycle, we replace
them in an incubator, in order to conserve the hens, and in this way
keep them setting for more than one incubation cycle. This does not
seem to be harmful to the hatching process, at least any more harmful
than anything else. Would that we could learn something of the reason
for the relatively low rate of hatching, below 33 per cent.
The most interesting duck reared this past season from an egg just
picked up at random in a nest of no known ascription, nor indeed a
homogeneous nest, was a male Ringneck Duck, a charming North
American species, often kept in captivity, but which has defied our
efforts since 1940, to nest and rear young in captivity. Delacour lists
only one breeding, at the Delta Waterfowl Station in Manitoba. It
would be interesting to know if there are other records, sustained by
actual proven birds reared ? Often we find diving duck eggs in other
duck nests, sometimes as many as three species in a nest, although
more usually two. The only Canvasback eggs we have ever had have
been in such poly-parental nests. We find Redheads to be notorious
in this regard (can they be called parasitic ? I think not in this sense),
as also are Rosy-billed Pochard. Even Philippine ducks are becoming
addicted to this habit, sometimes to the detriment of other, smaller
species. For the first time this year we had a passage at arms between
Common and Ruddy Shelduck over the same nest site, in a very large
pen. The Common Shelduck won out, and all eggs taken from the
burrow, proved to hatch out Common Shelduck. The Ruddy failed to
lay at all.
By now in October the days are shortening, the calls which have been
subdued in August and September are resuming, and pair-formation is
active among the ducks. Our Hawaiian Nene are already active, and
territory-minded, and will soon go into the barn in which they have

By Mrs. K. M. Scamell (Newdigate, Surrey, England)
I am never very willing to write about unsuccessful breeding results
as I get too many failures to dwell upon them at length. One has to get
conditioned to many failures and few successes with foreign birds in this
climate of ours. However, on this occasion I have been asked by
several people to set out our experience in breeding but not rearing
this species in the hope that others may be more fortunate.
We have rarely been without a Humming Bird at any time during
the last sixteen years, but we have only attempted to solve the breeding
problems during the last two years. It is one thing keeping a single
Hummer, quite another to keep a pair or more in small garden
aviaries. The males generally seek out their mates and destroy them
by driving them from their nectar, thus weakening the females which
would soon die if not separated. An alternative is to keep a number of
Humming Birds in a large and heavily planted enclosure but from what
we have heard and seen, the losses can be very great in these communal
aviaries as the cocks are then in a position to attack each other as well
as the hens ! There are exceptions to the rule and also non-breeding
periods when it is safer to keep these birds together, but when they are
in breeding fettle it is most difficult to know what to do. Most of our
Humming Birds are kept in a conservatory which has a compartment
for each bird with an outside flight to each two compartments which
thus allows us to run the birds together or to let one out in the morning
and the other in the afternoon.
Colibri coruscans is a largish Humming Bird measuring about 5 inches.
The general body colour is green with the chin, upper throat and
centre breast violet-blue. The central tail feathers &amp;re greenish blue
and the remainder brilliant dark blue with a deep purplish blue sub-
terminal band. A patch below the eye and continuing over the ear

Birds of Colombia by R. Meyer de Schauer it is found in forest, scrub, and
pasture land from sub-tropical to temperate zones. Our Violet-eared
came from Ecuador. We purchased the male in late 1964, and the
female in May, 1965. The sexes are supposed to be alike but Mr. Riley
of Petcenta, Southall, where we made our purchases, was quite sure
they could be sexed by the shape of the beak. From a number he
selected one slightly on the small side and with a slight curve to its
beak and pronounced it a hen and a hen it undoubtedly is !
The hen was placed in the same compartment as the cock in our
conservatory and to our surprise he accepted her without too much
sparring. They shared the same outdoor flight at the same time, but
each had separate nectar tubes. Three months later we were presented
with some Humming Birds by Dr. Beraut of Rio de Janeiro, and this
necessitated some reorganization in the conservatory. As the Violet-
eared were the toughest and the most " amicable " of the collection,
they were removed to a birdroom in our small wood. This birdroom
has a number of cages and five indoor flights which each lead to an
outdoor flight. The two birds were given one of the compartments with
the outdoor flight facing east. The compartment measured 3 by 2 by
6 feet high and the outdoor flight measured 8 by 2 by 7 feet high.
Access between indoors and outdoors was controlled through a pop-
hole door actuated by hand from outside the building. They were left
free to shelter or stay in the flight until November when they were shut
in at dark until the hinged door was opened in the morning. The
birdroom was heated, but not thermostatically controlled ; only hardy
birds were housed there, and in cold weather the temperature inside
dropped to about 38* F. Unless there was a day frost they, like most of
our birds, spent the daylight hours in the outdoor flight.
On 19th March, 1966, we noticed that there were signs of nest-
building. Dried grass strands were all over the indoor compartment
(the birds were still being shut in at night). Eater in the morning the
start of a nest was seen on a wooden batten 4 ft. 3 in. from the
floor and which supports the wire-netting. The nest was about
2 inches from the nearest nectar tube, the base of which rested on the
batten. It was difficult to change the nectar tube without touching the
nest. Kapok, more grass, and moss were placed in the compartment.
In the outdoor flight the two birds were seen flying vertically, bill to
bill, until the hen settled on a low branch and the cock descended and
mated. Nest-building continued daily and by 22nd March it was about
1 inch deep and was now touching the nectar tube ! It now consisted of
moss, kapok, cotton-wool, all bound with fine strands of dried grass.
At 9.30 a.m. on the 23rd there was an egg, very white and surprisingly
large. It measured 15 by 9 mm. The male perched in the outside flight
and kept up a monotonous " cheep-cheep " all day. We again saw the
beak-to-beak flight, followed by mating on the same branch. The next

day was cold with snow, bright sunshine, and a N.E. wind--almost a
gale. The nest faced the open pop-hole which faced east. At nectar
changing time, the egg was placed precariously on the edge of the nest,
the hen must have dislodged it when leaving. A touch of my finger and
it rolled back. In spite of the cold weather, nectar consumption was
below normal.
At 8.30 a.m. next day, 25th March, there was a second egg in the nest.
We had already decided to remove the male if there was a second egg.
This was done after a difficult chase in the outdoor flight with the hen
shut in her inside compartment. He was placed in a nearby aviary.
We bored a small peep-hole in the wall of the birdroom so that we
could observe from time to time the compartment housing the hen and
nest without ourselves being seen. She seemed very restless that day
and little time was spent on the nest. As the days passed she now
incubated for long periods, but did spend some time to feed. Her
nectar consumption during this sort of weather was normally slightly
less than a " Birdland " tube. It dropped first to about two-thirds and
later to three-fifths of a tube. The separated cock in his nearby aviary
was taking a full tube daily. In the other four compartments in the
birdroom were breeding pairs of Bulbuls, Rothschild's Grackles, and
Sunbirds. In addition, a number of Softbills were in the cages. It now
became difficult to water, feed, and clean out these birds as the hen
came off her nest most times when we entered, so one at a time all the
birds except the breeding pairs were quietly removed to other quarters.
When disturbed we noticed, from observations, that it took her a full
minute to return to the nest after we left. She generally had a drink,
then cleaned her beak on a perch, preened a few feathers and then
hovered over the nest to alight gently. During incubation the nest
was gradually added to. As the birdroom was too cool to breed fruit
flies in volume for the expected chicks, we solved this problem by
applying local heat from a horticultural heating tape around the large
box containing overripe fruit and drosophila and their eggs.
On 5th April, the fourteenth day after the first egg was laid, we
thought it a good idea to refresh our memory on the possible incubation
period. Turning to Birds of the World by Oliver L. Austin we read this
could vary from fourteen to nineteen days. We also read that only in
one group, i.e. the Violet-eared Humming Birds, was incubation and
rearing shared by both parents ! And we had separated them ! A
hasty search through our bird books brought two further confirmations.
In the Avicultural Magazine for 1957, p. 86, Professor Berlioz was
reported to have made a similar statement, quoting Dr. E. Schafer
as having observed both parents sharing the incubation and rearing.
A similar reference is also made concerning Colibri coruscans in Humming-
birds by Crawford H. Greenwalt. It was too late now to do anything
about it, but we were left wondering how well had the female incubated

on her own and why should just one species of Humming Birds require
the attention of both parents for these particular duties.
When the nectar was being changed on 7 th April it was noticed how
dark the eggs had turned. She was sitting very tight and at 5.30 p.m. on
the 8th she came off the nest when I entered the birdroom and I saw
one egg had hatched ! It was the seventeenth day after laying and the
fifteenth day after incubation had commenced. The chick looked
somewhat like a large spider ! The day was warm, 59 0 F, though dull
with some rain. We decided to open the pop-hole door and give the hen
free access to the outdoor flight for the first time since the second egg
was laid. She was seen several times up to late evening hawking insects
in this flight.
The next morning was rainy, the second egg had hatched by
8.30 a.m. Somehow we didn't expect it as she was off the nest such a
lot the previous evening. We watched her take fruit flies in the shelter
and saw her feed both chicks. During the next two days we made many
observations and it was very noticeable that the hen preferred the
insects she hawked in the flight to the fruit flies in the shelter. The
chicks were now showing brownish yellow down sprouting here and
there and it was amusing to see such small objects sitting up to gape.
I couldn't make out what certain little black rings dotted about the
edge of the nest were until I saw one excrete ! Nectar consumption was
now slightly in excess of the male's.
It was much colder on the 12th and 13th, the outside temperature
being about 39 0 F. Inside the shelter it was 6o* F. We were using an oil
heater and fruit flies were in plentiful supply. I saw the chicks briefly,
they were growing fast and the down was changing to brown/black.
About 4 p.m. I spent some time at the peep-hole and saw her feed each
of the young three times. Each time she perched on the nest, then had a
drink of nectar, hawked in the shelter and followed this by brooding.
14th April was a most difficult day. It started snowing just before
8 a.m. and continued until 4 p.m. when about 6 inches of snow
covered everything. With all our birds in aviaries and many nesting,
we had a very busy time shutting in the shelters those birds which could
be shut in and treble feeding those which couldn't. At 9 a.m. we shut
the pop-hole door to the Hummers' outside shelter as the snow and wind
were blowing directly on the nest and the shelter temperature was only
50 0 F. However, at dark the young birds seemed none the worse, and
the nectar consumption was a full tube as against the male's seven-
eighths of a tube.
The thaw set in the following day though the temperature outside
was only a few degrees above freezing. The afternoon was dripping and
dismal and by evening it was raining. We kept the hen shut in all day.
Both young birds were strong and observing them through the peep-
hole at 1 p.m. the hen was seen to approach the nest and perch on the

edge. Two heads and necks shot up like small snakes. She inserted her
beak repeatedly, jerking food down. It was quite a vigorous act. The
next three days were milder and very wet. The shelter tended to get
too warm and we regretted that it was the only birdroom without
thermostatic control. On 19th April nectar consumption was down to
three-quarters of a tube. The chicks seem to sleep a lot. Their beaks are
triangular in shape.
The next day we began to feel that something was wrong. The hen
brooded most of the time and the young birds did not gape as often as
they had been doing. On the 21st the weather was fine and dry, the
temperature outside was 50* F, so opened the pop-hole door again. Was
still not satisfied that the chicks were progressing. During a thirty-
minute period, the hen brooded about twenty minutes before feeding.
The two small heads didn't pop up like they did and growth seems to
have ceased. There is no feathering, only down and nectar consump-
tion about four-fifths of a tube, the separated male taking a full tube in
his colder aviary.
The following day the two young birds were very weak, they
scarcely moved except to breathe, and their heads rolled about. They
no longer gaped and the hen couldn't feed them. She hawked occasion-
ally but spent most of the time brooding. Both chicks were dead at
4 p.m. One was fifteen days old, the other a day younger. We removed
the two dead birds and as the hen looked most dejected, we returned the
male to the aviary and shut them in the shelter. They were both quite
peaceable for a while and when we thought it safe to do so, ceased to
observe them. However, on returning to the shelter about 6 p.m., we
found the cock jammed head-first in the pop-hole door which was not
tightly shut. We opened this door and released him into the flight but
the hen went for him tooth and nail so we had to catch him up and put
him back into his former aviary, a somewhat battered bird !
By the following day the male seemed to have recovered so he was
once again returned to the hen. There were no fireworks this time, but
for safety nectar was placed in the shelter and the flight. It would seem
that the hen stayed in the flight the whole time and within a week she
was not well, probably a chill, so we took to shutting them both in the
shelter at night as well as giving terramycin in the nectar for five days.
In a few days she was completely recovered. To revert back to the dead
chicks, we still have them preserved in spirit. The cause of death in
both cases could well be due to strands of cotton-wool getting into the
gullet when the mother fed them. If the weather had been more suitable
and she had had access to the flight the whole time she could have made
a better job of cleaning her beak. The beaks are slightly open and what
looks like cotton fibre is visible. We had a similar experience with a
young Malachite Sunbird about three years ago when it had teased
string stuffed down its throat from the hen's sticky beak. This we

managed to pull out and saved the bird but the Humming Birds were
still very small and we did not suspect this was the problem. We were
also rather obsessed with the need to breed masses of fruit flies and at
first thought the lack of progress was due to lack of flies. This was not
so. Throughout the incubation and rearing periods the hen was
continually repairing or adding to the nest which in the last week had
become very loose in structure.
On 5th May, artificial nests were placed in various positions in the
flight and shelter as it was by now obvious that she would never return
to her original nest. They were made of Twilweld mounted on wooden
bases. Overnight some moss and grass strands had been woven into one
of the " nests 55 in the shelter and when this was added to during the
next two days hopes ran high ! Nectar consumption rose, but nothing
came of this attempt. Within a week the hen was again the stronger
of the pair and though she stayed in the flight day and night, she would
not allow the cock to leave the shelter. If he went outside when his
nectar was changed, she chased him back again. He now started to
moult and soon became a mass of quills and also grew new tail feathers.
On 2nd June I noticed that a change had come over the behaviour of
the two birds, in fact both birds were in the shelter together in the day-
time. The cock was even tolerated in the outside flight and they were
seen to carry out their beak-to-beak flight for the first time since early
April. No nesting was attempted and the cock was still sprouting new
feathers so his moult was incomplete. Hot weather had really set in at
this time with temperatures in the low 8o's F. It was not until the end of
June that the cock completed his moult. He still lurked in the shelter
and when he ventured into the outside flight the hen displayed her
brilliant ear coverts but not so the cock. This state of affairs continued
throughout July but on 3rd August the hen started building a nest in
the fork of a prunus tree about 6 feet from the ground, completely
exposed to the elements and almost touching the wire netting dividing
the Humming Birds from the Scarlet-chested Sunbirds in the adjacent
aviary. The latter were nesting on the other side of the netting and the
two nests were only a foot apart. The Humming Bird's nest grew
rapidly and as before it was constructed mainly of cotton-wool bound
with grasses and with bits of moss stuck here and there. On 6th August
the hen was sitting and did not come off when I passed. At 10 a.m. she
was drinking nectar so I had a quick look into the nest from the vantage-
point of a step-ladder ! There were no eggs. Several times that day
she was sitting and this u on " and " off" affair continued for some
days. We gave her every variety of nesting material, lichen, moss,
kapok, etc., but she preferred " Boots " new cotton-wool which she
kept adding to the nest. She was sitting tight early on the morning of
the 9th, but still no eggs ! However, about 5 p.m. she was off the nest
and a quick look showed one egg at last ! The next two days were wet

and warm and the hen rarely sat, but spent much of the time sparring
with the cock.
At 8 a.m. on 12th August she was sitting tight and did not leave the
nest when I passed, nor did she at 9.30 a.m. when the nectar was
changed. I felt sure she had laid her second egg. At 11 a.m. she was not
sitting. Moreover the nest was destroyed and the pieces littered the
flight. We shut the pair of birds in the shelter and after a search found
two eggs in the grass, about 12 and 18 inches from the nest. They were
unbroken so a crude repair job was done to the nest as quickly as
possible and the two eggs carefully laid on top. We then caught up
the pair of Scarlet-chested Sunbirds from the next flight (a few days
before there were two chicks in their nest but this morning it was
empty) and placed them in another aviary as it seemed possible that
the two Sunbirds had pulled the nest to pieces through the netting,
particularly as there were a couple of pieces of cotton-wool on their side
of the netting. It was also possible that the male Humming Bird was
the culprit but with three reports by noted ornithologists that both
parents shared incubation, we were inclined to blame the Sunbirds. We
next opened the pop-hole door and allowed the two Humming Birds
freedom to enter the flight at will. The hen did so, but the cock stayed
in the shelter and kept up his monotonous call. Neither bird showed
any interest in the nest or eggs which were getting rain-soaked. After a
few days we placed a sheet of polythene over the half of the flight in
which the nest was located, but to no avail. On 1st October we removed
the eggs. At the time of writing the cock is still in breeding condition
(19th October), but the hen is not as strong as she was and we have
separated them, the hen in the shelter and the cock in the flight. The
weather is getting a bit chilly at nights so this arrangement now needs
altering. I am thinking of putting the cock in the adjacent flight
shelter for the winter and try and pair them up in early spring. We
have tried several times lately, but I am sure the male would kill the
female if we had not each time separated them after a few minutes. I
feel sure also that the hen must be as strong as, or stronger than, the
cock before it is safe to put them together and from our very limited
experience this may also apply to our other pairs of Humming Birds.
Dr. Beraut paid us another visit in September and when told of the
destruction of the nest in August he said at once that it was the male.
He added that all male Humming Birds in an aviary would destroy the
nest in similar circumstances. In the wild state they can depart once
the hen starts to incubate but in the confines of " an aviary-for-two "
there is no second choice so the hen is not permitted to incubate.
Dr. Beraut just did not accept that Violet-eared are exceptions to the
rule. We are inclined to agree with him and, if there is a next time,
out goes the male probably the day after the first egg is laid ! I think
we blamed the Sunbirds unjustly though they may have joined in the

nest destruction once it started, particularly as, for some reason, they
had just " lost " their own clutch which was the fourth this season with
none reared ! It certainly hasn't been a successful breeding season
taking it all round.
The nectar recipe we have used during the last eighteen months for
all our nectar drinkers was given to us by Dr. Beraut and we think it is
the best of many recipes we have used in the last thirty years. It is also
very easy to make and it keeps twenty-four hours in all weathers. We
modified his recipe slightly by adding more water as we found it too
thick for our cooler climate and I give below the one we use :--
Gevral-Protein J oz. ; White sugar 5 oz. ; Water to make 30 oz.
The Gevral-Protein (made by the Lederle Laboratories Division of
the American Cyanamid Co., Pearl River, New York, U.S.A.), is a
white powder with a 60 per cent protein content plus minerals and
vitamins. It is made into a smooth paste by the addition of a little cold
water. The sugar is dissolved separately with sufficient nearly boiling
water and cooled by the addition of about 20 fluid ounces of cold water.
The cool syrup is then added to the Gevral paste, well stirred and made
up to 30 fluid ounces by more cold water. Some of the proteins do not
dissolve and fall to the bottom of the nectar tubes as a sediment.
However, we have discarded the plastic closures supplied with the
" Birdland " tubes and substituted corks so fitted that the thin end of
the cork, when inserted in the tube, just reaches the spout. The sedi-
ment, therefore, is constantly stirred by the Humming Bird's tongue so
that the bird gets much of the Gevral. In addition, we usually shake
the tubes once per day. Other nectar drinkers receive their supplies
in the " Flow-matic " type of drinker. They all seem to get sufficient
nutriment from this diet provided ample fruit flies are also available.
At one time we bought our supplies of Gevral direct from the U.S.A.,
but I am glad to say that a London bird dealer now stocks it and we
obtain our supplies from him. (Petcenta, Southall.)

By M. F. Coupe (Zoological Gardens, Chester, England)
Two pairs of Curassows purchased as Crested arrived at Chester Zoo
on 13th October, 1961. On arrival they were thought to be Common
Crested Curassow [Crax alector) or (Crax nigra) but subsequent investi-
gation has revealed that they are the very similar Sclater's Crested
Curassow (Crax fasciolata sclateri). One cock died during March, 1962,
and a hen died during March, 1963. The remaining pair was housed in
various aviaries throughout the Zoo, according to weather conditions
or stock of birds at the particular time. The even temperament of this
species enabled them to be mixed with a variety of smaller species.
During 1965 eggs were laid, but eaten by other birds in the mixed
collection ; however, neither cock nor hen Curassow showed any signs
of incubation or protective instincts. With the coming of colder
weather both Curassows were transferred to the then newly opened
Temperate Bird House.
With the start of the 1966 breeding season we looked forward to the
Curassows laying again. They laid two eggs, but took no interest in
them whatsoever, so they were removed to our incubator but unfortun-
ately proved to be infertile. A second clutch of two eggs was laid during
May on the rockwork surround near the waterfall in the Temperate
Bird House. These eggs were incubated but were stolen, we suspect by
children, just before they were due to hatch.
The third clutch of two eggs was laid in a far safer position, on a three
foot square platform at a height of fifteen feet in the Temperate Bird
House (see photograph). This platform had been erected and filled
with small twigs to encourage the Crowned Pigeons to nest.
Incubation was undertaken entirely by the hen bird and she came
off the nest to feed twice most days. The cock bird was not seen to
incubate this clutch at all though he had taken part in the unsuccessful
incubation of the previous clutch. He did however, take a keen interest
in the nest and was never far away. The eggs were large, coloured white
with a rough shell.
On 7th August the two eggs hatched after an incubation period of
twenty-nine days.
Within hours of hatching the chicks became very lively and were
running around on the nesting platform. This posed a problem for the
keepers as the youngsters could not fly and were fifteen foot above a
running stream and a public walkway. For some time continuous watch
was kept, but it was decided that the hen and young would have to be
moved. They were finally transferred to the long open air aviary in the
Bird House. In the normal way all the birds at liberty in the Temperate

Bird House can fly into this aviary but we decided to leave the bob-
hole open, thus allowing access to small species only. The following
morning we decided to move the cock bird into this aviary as he was
obviously so upset at being separated. A careful watch was kept on him
for some time in case he should attack the chicks, but fortunately he
proved to be the perfect father.
The young Curassows are very well developed compared with
similar species at the same age. As can be seen in the photograph,
which was taken when they were three days old, the primaries are very
noticeable. When four to five days old the chicks easily managed to fly
into bushes in the aviary at a height of two to three feet, but spent
most of their time on the ground, during day. At an age of twelve days
they began to show aggressive behaviour, chasing a Spreo Starling
from the food dish.
From the start it was noticeable that the young followed either parent
and kept close or underneath the tail, especially when very small.
A good variety of food was offered including maggots, worms, hard-
boiled egg, diced fruit, grain, greenfood and insectivorous mixture.
Both parents fed the chicks, taking food in their beaks and calling the
young to them. The chicks were very soon able to find food for them-
selves, but even when they were eight weeks old the parents still
called them when some very tasty food was found. To start with the
young proved mainly insectivorous but ate more fruit etc., as they
became older ; peanuts were also eaten readily at a later stage.
At the time of writing, when the Curassows are a little over eight
weeks old, they are approaching a Golden Pheasant in body size and
have a tail roughly the same size in proportion to their bodies as the
adults. They have both become increasingly darker coloured since
hatching and are even beginning to develop the characteristic curly
crest.
With the arrival of frost this year it was decided to transfer all the
Curassows to an inside aviary as these birds seem particularly suscept-
ible to frost-bite. They are now accommodated in one of the aviaries
inside the Temperate Bird House, but when the young are older the
whole family will be released within the confines of the building.
As described by M. F. Coupe, Sclater's Crested Curassow Crax
fasciolata sclateri, has been bred at the Zoological Gardens, Chester. It
is believed that this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at
once with the Hon. Secretary.

POSTSCRIPT ON THE CHINESE PAINTED QUAIL
</sectionHeader>

By Sheila M. Rogerson (Whitegate, Cheshire, England)
My article on Personal Observations of the Chinese Painted Quail
which was published in the July-August issue of this magazine
described the pleasures and trials of keeping and breeding these small
birds. During their first breeding year, the pair in question produced
four hens and three cocks which were eagerly snapped up by enchanted
aviculturist friends.
But this year our pair presented us with the traditional baker's dozen,
thirteen in all and although many people came to see the fluffy bumble-
bee chicks, only six went to new homes, possibly because out of the
thirteen, there were only three hens. So seven little cocks stayed at home.
It all began as the month of April came to a close. Our adult pair
of Quail started in earnest on the family game and choosing a corner
of the shelter, seven eggs were laid and duly hatched. Before we could
accurately sex them another family was well on the way and the first
chicks were moved to a separate flight. The second nest was made in
the open flight sheltered by a large clump of grass and had been very
difficult to find. Six little chicks emerged safely from this round and
once again the adult hen decided to start another family.
To avoid trouble with the elder chicks, the second clutch was put
into another flight as by now the first chicks appeared quite adult. But
space was quickly becoming scarce and it was a great relief to us when
disaster struck the third nest. It began to rain steadily for several days
and fearing the hen would suffer from the constant downpour, my
husband placed a cover over the nest to protect it from the worst of the
elements. The hen instantly took a dislike to this innovation and
deserted her eggs.
We decided to advertise the remaining seven young Quail and as they
were all now in adult plumage, we put them together and awaited the
customers. But by the time the advertisement appeared in the press all
seven had indulged in a " free for all " and were a very sorry sight.
Each dainty beak had savagely pecked the head and neck of its
neighbour. One by one they were brought into the emergency ward
(my kitchen) and were bathed and treated with antiseptic cream.
Each was then deposited into separate aviaries and a frantic search was
made for seven pots for seed and seven dishes for water. Grit was simply
scattered on the ground. A visit to the local greengrocer produced
seven wooden boxes which were hastily converted into miniature
shelters. Thankfully, the chicks all healed rapidly and most of them
have been found new homes.
It will be a long time before I forget this incident and I can now
better appreciate how " the old lady who lived in a shoe " felt when
she also had so many children, she didn't know what to do !

The most rewarding aspect of the bird breeding programme at the
Bronx Zoo during 1966 was the opportunity of observing at close
quarters the courtship, nesting, and rearing accomplished by a number
of species in the simulated habitats that form the displays of the new
Aquatic Birds Building.
Inca Terns, Sun-bitterns, Kittlitz's Sandplovers, African Spur-
winged Plovers, and Black-necked Stilts all produced young again this
year but to this list we can now add Black-winged Stilt ( Himantopus
himantopus himantopus) and Panama Boat-billed Heron ( Cochlearius
cochlearius panamensis). The Boat-bills have tried to nest repeatedly
during the last two years but this is the first time that they have
successfully reared young. Also breeding for the first time in our

In all, forty-three species and subspecies, representing thirteen
families, nested and produced young during the year and 143 birds
were reared.
Among the additions new to the collection and worthy of special note
during the year were

The last occasion on which a new family of birds was received into
the collection was in 1957 when the first of the Indicatoridae, the
Cameroon Spotted Honeyguide, arrived from the Cambridge French
West Africa Expedition.
Now the first specimen of the Formicariidae, the Short-tailed Ant-
thrush (Chamaeza campanisona ) has been presented by the executors of
the late Capt. R. S. de Q. Quincey's estate. The recent history of this
bird is that it was on a dealer's stand at the National Cage Birds
Exhibition several years ago and advertised as a Brazilian Rail. It
was soon noticed by Mr. Sawyer who bought it and it has lived since
then in the aviaries of the late Capt. de Quincey. It is rather rail-like
in its movements, for it walks and occasionally flirts the short tail and
the wings ; in general appearance it is like a boldly marked thrush
with rather long legs.
There are some 200 species in this family, collectively known as
Ant-birds and all live in South and Central America. There is consider-
able diversity among them as may be judged from the popular names--
Ant-pittas, Ant-wrens, Ant-shrikes, Ant-vireos and so on. Most live in
forests and some have the habit of following the armies of foraging
ants in order to feed on the small creatures fleeing from them. The
calls of some are said to be loud and penetrating.
A new genus is represented by two Green-crowned Brilliant
Humming Birds ( Heliodoxajaculajamesoni ) and new species by an Andean
Humming Bird ( Amazilia franciae viridiceps) , two Black-headed Gonoleks
(Laniarius barbarus erythrogaster ), a Splendid Starling ( Lamprotornis
s. splendidus ) and a Philippine Flowerpecker (Dicaeum p. papuense).
Two new subspecies are the Philippine races of Lonchura malacca
(jagori ) and L. punctulata ( cabanisi ).
Mr. J. O. D'eath has presented two White-necked Ravens ( Corvus
albicollis), the first to be exhibited here for many years.
Among birds bred in the Gardens are Erckel's Francolins, Sonnerat's
and Tonkinese Junglefowl, Painted Quail, Night Herons, a Cattle
Egret, Sarus Cranes, Grey-headed Gallinules and Crested Pigeons.

J. Rawlings, Kelling Park Aviaries, has successfully bred Ijima's
Copper Pheasant, Syrmaticus soemmerringi ijimae. Some half-dozen birds
were reared, but all, I believe, are very regrettably, being sent to
America.
This, the most beautiful of all Copper Pheasants is also the rarest
in captivity. Its range is the southern part of Kiusiu Island, Japan, in
the provinces of Osumi, Hyuga and Satsuma. Dr. H. E. Dresser
named it in honour of Professor Ijima, Professor of Zoology in Tokyo
University, who first sent him a specimen for examination, in 1902.
Living examples reached Cleres in 1927. They did not, however,
breed there but a male later produced hybrids with a Reeves's hen in
Professor Ghigi's aviaries at Bologna, Italy.

In the Avicultural Bulletin , 1966, July, it was reported that David
B. King, Ventura, California, had bred a " hybrid of an Aztec and a
Jenday Conure David King informs me that the report was in error
and that the hybrid was in fact Nanday X Jendaya. Two young ones
were hatched in July, 1964. One died at about three months of age,
but the other is described as a " beautiful bird, very much like a
Nanday with a red breast
This is possibly the first time this cross has been reared. But in the
Avicultural Magazine, 1951, 70, Ken Stott, Jr., lists : " Jendaya
Conure X Nanday Conure : Birds purported to be of this parentage
produced an offspring in 1950 ", in the San Diego Zoo.

The remarkably successful, and much publicized, efforts of Peter
Scott and the Wildfowl Trust to re-establish the endangered Ne-ne
in the islands of Hawaii and Maui somewhat naturally rather over-
shadow efforts in other fields.
Sight must not, however, be lost of the endeavours of Philip Wayre to
build up a stock of Swinhoe's Pheasant. The Ornamental Pheasant
Trust has fifteen pairs ready to send to Taiwan (Formosa). Philip
Wayre proposes taking these birds by air in April next year. It is to
be hoped that he will be able to stay in Taiwan long enough to film
the local fauna.
Rather nearer home, on 4th August six pairs were released on
Brownsea Island, Poole Harbour, Dorset, in an attempt to establish
a feral population. Six pairs of Blue Eared Pheasants were also released
at the same time in another part of the island.

W. D. Cummings writes that the following birds were bred at Keston
during the past season : " Four African Grey Parrots, two Festive X
Jamaican Amazon Parrots, three Leadbeater's Cockatoos, two
Leadbeater's X Greater Sulphur-crested Cockatoos, six blue Ring-
necked Parrakeets, six Barraband's Parrakeets, two Fairy Bluebirds,
one Blue-shouldered Mountain Tanager, two albino House Sparrows
(one a cock bird), one Rufous-bellied Niltava, and the usual number
of Rosellas and Grass Parrakeets. The Chestnut-breasted Rock
Thrushes had one fertile egg which they failed to hatch.
The Leadbeater's X Greater Sulphur-crested cross is of particular
interest because of the great difference in size of the two birds. The
parents were two odd birds, paired together for convenience, and they
seemed to take to one another straight away. The two young hybrids
are dainty birds and take after their male parent in size, but are more
like the Sulphur-crested Cockatoo in colouring. In immature plumage
they are pure white with a yellow cheek mark. The base of the crest is
yellow, shading to pale orange at the tip ".

It is customary for the Editor of Australian Aviculture to publish
" The Prices of Birds " in the August number. This list gives what is
considered the fair, average selling price between members. While
intended primarily for Victorian members it is a guide for the whole
of Australia.
The prices refer to true, adult pairs, well acclimatized or aviary-bred,
and in good condition. Finches, pheasants, quail, doves and pigeons,
and parrot-like birds are all included, but the last named only are
given here. The Australian common names have been retained but the
prices have been converted, for the sake of convenience, from Australian
dollars to United Kingdom pounds.

In the March-April number of the Magazine I inquired which was
the most numerous species of bird in the British Isles. There was,
however, no response.
Roger Bailey, B.T.O. News , July, 1966, gives the probable answer
when he summarizes the Common Bird Census, 1965. He says that
" enthusiasts mapped some 12,000 bird territories over widely spaced
areas totalling 35 square miles of farmland and 3J square miles of
woodland ". He has drawn up two lists giving the ten most numerous
birds for farmland and woodland census plots respectively. Four
species--Wood Pigeon, Rook, Starling and House Sparrow--have
been excluded on account of lack of reliable estimates. The top three
in each section are : Farmland , Blackbird, Chaffinch, Dunnock ;
Woodland , Robin, Blackbird, Chaffinch. Members interested in such

former is a misnomer --Prunella modularis is really an accentor not

COMMON CAGEBIRDS IN AMERICA. By V. Clear. Bobbs-

This book is a brief and breezy general survey of aviculture, intended
for the beginner and written specifically for the American market. It
limits itself to typical cagebirds which are conveniently grouped under
such categories as--singers, brightly coloured birds, hookbills and
mynahs, and well-domesticated birds. The information is obviously
based on considerable experience of bird keeping and the author's
enthusiasm shows itself everywhere. It seems, to a disenchanted
aviculturist's ear, to make everything sound so wonderfully easy,
but perhaps this is a good thing in a book intended to fire the enthusiasm
of the newcomer to aviculture. In addition to the earlier chapters
which combine brief descriptions of a range of species with information
on how to keep them, there are also chapters on care and management,
illness, and on buying birds ; these again are based on wide experience
and contain much useful information. The birds concerned are all
foreign to the United States. I note that the author strongly criticizes
the Australian Government's total ban on the export of native birds,
but glosses over the similar ban, equally open to criticism, on the
keeping of native birds in the United States. It is perhaps unfair to
criticize the more academic points, but it is a pity that the erroneous
belief in the hybrid origin of the Bengalese Finch should still be with
us. It is a greater pity that the name " Button Quail " which specifically
refers to birds of the genus Turnix of the order Gruiformes, should be
used for a true quail of the order Galliformes which is almost universally
known as the Painted Quail and which has nothing to do with the
Button Quails ; and it seems unnecessary to use the name " hookbill ",
which might refer to anything from a hawk to an albatross, for the
Parrots. The book is copiously illustrated with colour photographs
taken especially for the purpose. This is an excellent idea, but some-
what marred in places by very poor colour values or impossible tints,
and by the scruffy appearance of some of the birds.

These three monographs, in the Dover Books on Nature series

Reports of the National Audubon Society. Those on the Ivory-billed
Woodpecker and the Roseate Spoonbill were published in 1942 and
the report on the California Condor in 1953. All are comprehensive
careful studies and include accounts of the ecology and natural history
of the birds with emphasis on their need for protection and suggestions
for measures to be taken to this end. The books are fully illustrated

These records of bird song recorded, edited and introduced by
Lawrence Shove, are of a very high standard and the purity of the
songs and calls is most pleasing, not the least asset being the lack of
interfering background noise. It is stated that Mr. Shove is an amateur
who is following the footsteps of the indefatigable Dr. Ludwig Koch
from whom in 1964 he received a first prize in the B.B.C./Council for
Nature wildlife tape recording competition. The prize was evidently
well merited and all three records can be thoroughly recommended.

Since so few members of our Society write about foreign doves and pigeons, it was
a pleasant surprise to read Mr. Goodwin's informative and comprehensive suggestions
in the July-August issue. This writer wishes merely to add a few more, which may
prove helpful to keepers of these delightful birds.
All seed-eating doves and pigeons are very fond of corn (maize), excluding only the
smallest varieties for whom it is too large. They like especially pop-corn, which
is a subspecies of Indian corn, its kernels being smaller and rounder than those of the
parent form. Even in our mild Southern California climate. Bleeding Hearts, Key-
West Quail Doves, Violet Doves, and many other species consume generous quantities
of pop-corn summer and winter, even though they have a choice of other grains.
All of them relish cracked sunflower seed and diced longhorn cheese, which they get

once a week. I should have mentioned above that pop-corn is somewhat more expen-
sive than the regular corn, and I do not know under what name it is offered in England.
Another pertinent point : fruit doves (they are kept by many fanciers in California,
including this writer) being exceedingly voracious, quickly learn to descend to the
floor of the aviary where food and water are available. Their menu is rather simple :
boiled rice mixed with various fruits seems to suit them very well. In some instances
they have been gradually weaned away from eating fruit and " learned " to feed on
grains, which at first were mixed with the chopped fruit.
Finally, one more comment. The simplest and most effective method of protecting
aviary doves and pigeons from injuring their heads through flying against the wire-
netting used as a roof for the flight, is to use a solid roof. This can be transparent or
non-transparent. The writer's aviary--both shelter and flight--is covered with a solid,
non-transparent roof placed sufficiently high to still admit ample morning sunshine.
During the 9 years' use, not a single dove has injured its head or wings, since any
and all disturbances and dangers from above by cats, owls, etc., have been completely
eliminated by means of the solid roof.

INFORMATION REQUIRED REGARDING THE JAVA SPARROW'S
BREEDING ABILITY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9863362" page_id="56366467"  page_num="180" year="" vol="">
There are many old wives' tales in the world of aviculture, and the greatest wealth
of these is to be found in the subject of breeding. I am hoping to get some quantitative
information about the Java Sparrow's breeding abilities. Leaving the white and
" calico " domestic varieties to one side, it seems that the grey wild form is very
difficult to breed in confinement, and records are extremely infrequent--especially
when one considers the vast numbers that are sold each year.
There is something wrong with this because (a) the Japanese have domesticated it--
suggesting a degree of adaptability in the species to start with, and (b) when the grey
bird has bred, it has behaved exactly like any other prolific and affable Lonchura --
taking to a wicker basket, budgie nest-box, etc., and rearing young on an all-seed diet
in a mixed collection.
A suggestion has been made (not by me, bnt I have some sympathy with it) that the
main reason so few Java Sparrows breed in confinement is because the majority of
the imported birds are males. Now I wonder if members who have bred, or simply
kept, grey Javas could tell me :

Reference was made to the Protection of Birds Bill in the January-
February number of the Magazine (page 35) when it was reported
that the Bill had passed its Second Reading in the House of Commons
on 28th January, 1966. Owing to the dissolution of Parliament the Bill
did not pass through its final stages and therefore became void.
However, Lord Hurcomb reintroduced the Bill into the House
of Lords during the present session, in July, and it passed its Second
Reading. The Earl of Cranbrook kindly undertook to put forward an
amendment providing that licences could be issued by the Home
Secretary for " taking birds for the purposes of aviculture " and
succeeded in securing the adoption of this amendment at the Committee
stage of the Bill on 31st October. The thanks of aviculturists are due to
the Earl of Cranbrook and also to the members of the sub-committee
appointed by the Avicultural Society, Messrs. Colin Harrison, Claude
Payne, and Philip Wayre, who have been ceaseless in their work in
connection with the Bill.
The Bill has also to be passed through the House of Commons but
it is encouraging to know that the interests of aviculturists will be in the
good hands of Mr. William Wilson, M.P. for Coventry South.

Hon. Secretary.

From 1 st November, parrots, budgerigars, and other psittacine
birds may be freely imported into Great Britain, and importation
licences will no longer be required from Agricultural Departments.
Importations have hitherto been allowed only under licence because
these birds could carry fowl pest virus. Long experience has shown
that in practice they are not a significant factor in the introduction or
spread of disease in this country.
