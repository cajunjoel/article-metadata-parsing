By H. A. Fooks
" The art of trapping " is an expression not generally heard in
these days of hundred-guinea guns and high-velocity rifles, yet it is
in very truth an art of the highest order.
During the recent war in Burma, trapping came into its own.
From jungle fowl to Japs it was all the same, and every booby-trap
and trip-wire laid was very much more effective if laid by a man
skilled in trapping.
For the airman brought down in the jungle or for the Chindit or
deep penetration personnel it meant food with a capital F.
Even where supplies were available, compare an already overloaded
soldier carrying a shot-gun and cartridges, which after they have
been expended renders the gun just a useless lump weighing 6 lb. or
more, to a few pieces of string, a piece of wax, and a sharp knife !
It was lucky for a number of units in Burma that they had the help
of some of the best trappers in Asia. The Nagas, the Chins, the Kachins,
the Karens, and so on perform miracles with pieces of bamboo alone.
Traps usually used for small barking deer were enlarged and adapted
for the lurking Nip, who suddenly found himself impaled by half a
dozen fire-hardened and barbed bamboos, driven well home by
a bent bamboo 30 ft. long.
Before the war I had the pleasure of going out trapping with some
of the hill tribes under more favourable conditions than the last six
years, and I learnt that the simpler the trap the better it worked.
Reconnaissance is, of course, of primary importance as where to set
the trap comes first and foremost.
Botany is an essential subject as regards birds, whether they be
hardbills or softbills.
All birds follow flowers or berries as they bloom or ripen, and when

H. A. FOOKS-TRAPS AND TRAPPING
once the favourites are known it becomes necessary to look for signs
of use around these plants.
In hills (up to io 5 ooo ft. or so) a bush or tree will flower or fruit
much earlier at, say, 4,000 ft. than at 8,000 ft., so that it is not very
difficult to get above your quarry.
I have found it useful to spend a day or two with binoculars and
search all the likely places at dawn, and when the birds are found
shoot one or two and open their crops. This will give you the necessary
knowledge as to their favourite food.
Insectivorous birds will follow flowers as insects in their turn follow
flowers with a high nectar content, and as the seasons advance these
flowers will come into bloom at progressively higher altitudes.
I remember going out with Webb (imprisoned by the French in
Madagascar) to a place in the Himalayas at an altitude of 4,500 ft.
We were after the Fire-tailed Sunbird. They were feeding on a creeper
which bore masses of small glutinous white flowers round which
swarmed a mass of small flies.
These flowers appeared to bloom only for one day or, what was
more likely, they lost their attraction or scent in a short time and
this necessitated us going up at least 500 ft. every two or three days.
I remember finally seeing these Sunbirds, after I had left Webb at
13,000 some odd feet, feeding on scarlet rhododendron blossom, and
an unforgettable sight they were. Sunbirds are fairly easily caught
in nets. The net being double meshed and made of very fine black
thread, or even silk. One net has a mesh of some 4 sq. in. while the
other may be 1 sq. in.
The bird strikes the small mesh and is driven through one of the
meshes of the larger net which then forms the mouth of a bag. If
one bird is caught it can be used as a call bird, especially if it is a
cock, as most Sunbirds are particularly pugnacious. If a call bird
is used a single limed twig is stuck into the wires of the cage.
Salad oil quickly applied will soon get rid of the lime, and the
bird popped into a soft cloth bag will keep quite still while being
carried.
I once saw an Indian hillman catch eighteen Sunbirds with an
Owl and limed twigs.
He first pegged his Owl on a perch within a foot of the ground and
surrounded it with temptingly placed limed perches about 6 ft. to
10 ft. away. These twigs were 4 ft. to 5 ft. over the Owl and very
soon birds started to arrive and were quickly bagged. The Sunbirds
came in three flocks and after " dive bombing " the Owl settled on
the surrounding twigs and were caught. These birds were Mrs. Gould's
Sunbirds, some of which I kept for over four years in perfect plumage,
and I think Mr. Delacour saw them at my house in Calcutta.
Sunbirds appear to be the most sensible birds as they scarcely

ever refuse food for more than a few hours. The usual Horlicks or
Mellins Mixture with a drop of haliborange, placed near them in
a shallow small-mouthed ink-pot, keeps them busy once their beaks
have been dipped in the mixture several times.
Small cages are also essential, three sides wood and the front barred.
When the birds approach the bars they have to find their food whether
they wish to or not.
Most birds have aerial roadways. They will use the identical route,
even branch, time after time, although they may have been gone
half an hour or more. The trapper observes and notes these routes
and will hang his nets accordingly.
Small clap nets, a foot square, are very useful for insectivorous
birds, the cork which holds the trigger also serves to hold the impaled
grasshopper, beetle, or fly. Observing the habit and " beat 35 of the
birds is of course essential.
Such birds as Thi*hshes and so on are easy to catch once the bird
has been located.
There are several ways of snaring Pheasants, one way being
to build a small fence between the birds' feeding-ground and their
line of approach.
The birds on arriving at this fence will run up and down it to find
the ends. These are provided in the shape of small gaps with a horse-
hair noose in each. As most&apos; of these Pheasants are caught for food
they are usually pretty roughly handled or even left to die, and it
requires a deal of persuasion to make the men understand that the
bird should remain in one piece. When a bird walks into a snare the
excitement is great and the men rush forward and try to seize it by
the legs. This frequently results in one or both thighs being dislocated
as the bird twists and turns and attempts to fly. I always make them
smother it with a cloth if I can.
Some of the tribes have the most ingenious way of carrying them
after capture, and I can recommend this method to anyone who has
a wild and intractable bird.
The locals simply weave a basket round its wings and body, leaving
the head and tail outside. There is also a small handle on top by which
the bird can be conveniently carried, or, if there are several, strung
on a pole.
A piece of fibre tied to the handle allows the bird to forage and
scratch for itself without being able to run away. As they become
tamer a piece of twig tied crossways prevents it running through
grass or bushes and forces it to stay in the open.
In Bengal the inhabitants are very fond of using a " telescopic
bamboo ". This acts in the same way as a fishing rod and can be
extended to any required length. It is used either by being pushed
along the ground or vertically, against the trunk of a tree.

The first time I observed this method was when I was out Snipe
shooting and was just crossing a large grassy " maidan " sparsely
covered with small bushes.
I thought I had seen a bush in motion--but no, it could not have
been so--good heavens, there it goes again, and on closer scrutiny
I saw the bush being pushed carefully and slowly by a young man
who lay stretched out to his full length behind it.
On even closer inspection the bush proved to be a small shield
woven out of twigs and with the branches on the outside left intact.
The boy moved the screen forward with his left hand and held
six or seven tapering bamboos in his right. He was after Ortolans,
Larks, and anything which could be mistaken for an Ortolan.
On seeing a flock he would approach them quite openly to within
20 or 30 yards and then get down behind his shield.
After a few minutes' pause to allow the birds time to settle down
he would cautiously push himself forward with his toes, having first
joined several of his bamboos together.
When he had arrived within 20 feet or so of the birds he would
complete his " stick " and push it forward very slowly. At the extreme
tip of this he had a piece of split bamboo about 10 inches long. This
was V-shaped, and curled upward at the open end. Each arm was
coated with bird lime for a few inches.
The idea of the curls at the end was to enable the rest to ride over
obstructions and to keep the limed ends clear of the grass.
When the bird showed signs of alarm, usually when the V was
within a foot of it, the fowler flicked the whole stick forward and
twisted it at the same time, one or other of the limed prongs striking
the bird. Most of the men I have seen practising this trick have been
remarkably successful, and a bag of twenty to twenty-five birds in
a morning is not uncommon.
Many other birds are caught this way, particularly waders, and
many is the Stilt, Godwit, and Sandpiper I have bought off them
for a few annas.
The same telescopic stick is almost invariably used for catching
Ring-necked Parrakeets, particularly when they come to feed on
the flowers of the silk cotton tree. The other favourite trees are
those of the Ficus species when in fruit.
As far as I remember some of the lutinos bought by Sir David Ezra
for his brother were caught this way.
I once saw an aboriginal catch some eighty Blossom or Plum-headed
Parrakeets which were feeding on what looked like a species of wild
hemp.
Thousands of birds swarmed over the plants, which were being
continually bent down by their weight, and suddenly released again
when they rose. The whole scene was amazingly colourful and

animated, set as it was in a forest glade. The catcher was in a
small hide in the middle of the feeding birds and used several
" sticks
There is a way of catching duck in Bengal which I have never
heard of being practised elsewhere.
When the rice crops are ripening, about October, November,
duck in enormous numbers come down to feed on them in certain
favoured localities. They settle amongst the stalks and the beating
of their wings bears down the ears until they become waterlogged.
Naturally great damage is done and the individuals who suffer are
usually very poor and unable to afford nets or guns, so they have
recourse to other means whereby they can recoup some of their loss
by the sale of ducks and still have full stomachs at night.
In India kerosene tins, mostly empty, are obtainable almost any-
where (the poor man's house is usually built of these), and kerosene
and its containers are a sine qua non of this particular method of
dealing with ducks.
The entire village, possibly several villages, will club together and
meet at a given place and at a given time. A dark night is chosen
and the feeding duck encircled.
All participants are dressed in dark clothes or have no clothes on
at all, and each one carries either an empty kerosene tin, a casting
net, or a torch made of jute stalks.
After the encircling movement has taken place and the circle
closed in on the duck, a signal is given at which pandemonium
breaks loose. Torches are lit and whirled in circles, tins are thumped
and banged till it sounds as if the night of final destruction was at
hand.
The din is deafening and incessant for some minutes, then the
netters and small boys step in, casting their nets and grabbing ducks
when they feel or see them.
The ordinary mortal would expect every duck to rise the instant
the first sound was made, but instead the majority flatten themselves
out or dive in the shallow water. It is essential for the torches to keep
moving and the noise to continue unabated while the hunt is on, and
the scene generally beggars description. I was told the idea was to
simulate the father and mother of a thunderstorm in which the
duck would be afraid to rise. Whether this is the case I cannot say,
but it remains a fact that large bags are made in this way.
The essence of the performance is the absolute necessity of lighting
all torches and banging all tins almost the instant the starting signal is
given. A scattered volley, so to speak, would presumably give the
duck time to recover from their astonishment.
Unfortunately the finale is very cruel, as the duck which are caught
alive are immobilized by pulling their legs over the base of their

wings which renders them incapable of any progressive movement.
Another way is to interlock their wings over their backs. This, of
course, allows them the use of their legs and is therefore not in quite
such favour as the former method.
Catching duck, as practised in the Lucknow district is typically
Indian in its ingenuity. A reed-fringed sheet of water is selected
where duck are usually to be found resting during the heat of the day.
Through the resting rafts of duck a number of earthenware pots
are floated. These pots are known as " chattis 55 and are somewhat
larger than a football. It goes without saying that the wind has to
be in a suitable direction to move the pots in the required way.
At first the duck are alarmed, but usually do not rise from the
water. Gradually they become used to these floating objects sailing
past until eventually they scarcely bother to move out of the way.
When this desirable state has been reached the catcher and his
helpers each place a " chatti " over their heads after piercing a small
eyehole.
They now join the empty pots on their journey through the sleeping
duck, and, as they pass, seize the most suitable victim and flick it
under water--no noise--no commotion except perhaps a short-
drawn squawk from the duck.
When a run is completed they collect their pots and run back to
the start and commence again.
I have not seen this actually being done, but it is practised quite
frequently in certain districts. Kipling has written a good account of it.
The art of trapping reaches its highest flights when hunger is the
driving force and as the majority of the population in the East are
accentuated by this motive and are also incredibly poor, most of them
who live away from the few large towns soon learn from their earliest
infancy how to augment their rations in the simplest way whether
by catching fish, birds, or other animals.
Even insects do not escape, nor reptiles. Locusts are excellent
and so are flying lizards, when you know how to catch and cook them.
I have eaten a piece of python steak and was sufficiently hungry
at the time not to notice the taste, but that is another story.

A. GARGAN-BREEDING OF PARRAKEET HYBRIDS
BREEDING OF STANLEY x REDRUMP
PARRAKEET HYBRIDS
By A. Gargan
</sectionHeader>

Early in 1944 I had a spare Stanley Parrakeet cock and a surplus
of Redrump hens, so I decided to try and breed some hybrids.
The Stanley cock was a very tame bird, and is the only Parrakeet
I have that will eat insects. I have often seen him eat earwigs, and he
is very fond of Mediterranean moth grubs ; these are small white
grubs about y 3 ^- in. long, found in seed and cereals ; when the young
hatched out I gave him ten to twenty grubs a day.
The nest was made from a butter-box, creosoted inside and out,
filled with turf mould, with some sawdust sprinkled on top, and hung
in the open flight. The first egg was laid on 14th May, 1944, and in
all six were laid ; the first hatched out on the 5th June, 1944, and
five young were reared by the parents, and all young left the nest
by the 30th July, 1944.
The food offered was a mixture of 75 per cent groats, plus 25 per
cent plain Canary, hemp, sunflower, and monkey nuts, soft fruits,
seeding grasses, and chickweed.
The three young cocks were like Redrump cocks in colour with
the addition of a red cap on head and a red band on middle breast ;
the area of red on the rump was larger than that on the Redrump.
The two hens were like Redrump hens, except that they had the red
on the rump but had no red on head or breast.
A cock and hen died in December, 1944, and in January, 1945, I
entered a pair in the Metropolitan Cage Birds' Society's show and they
got first--a class of seven--and best foreign exhibit.
This year (1945) I put the original pair together with the following
result. I used the same aviary and nest-box, and the first egg was laid
on 14th April, 1945, and six eggs were again laid ; five were hatched
on 4th May, 1945. A few days after the last egg was hatched I found
the hen dead in the aviary and as the only other Parrakeets that had
young were a pair of Red Rosellas with three, I transferred the five
young hybrids to the Rosellas. For a week all went well, but as the
young Rosellas grew larger they squashed the smallest hybrid and
within the next week three of the young hybrids went the same way.
The Rosellas were offered the same food as the Stanley with the
exception of the fruits, which they would not touch. One young
hybrid, a cock, the same colour as the first lot, was reared, and is still
in the aviary with its foster-parents.

By Flight-Lieutenant D. H. S. Risdon
When the aviary was first started and all nicely planted, at consider-
able expense and trouble, I was against including Parrot-like birds
in the collection, because of their destructive habits towards growing
vegetation.
One day, however, a stray green cock Budgerigar was caught
trying to gain admittance. He seemed very lonesome, so a green
hen was bought for him. These two, in so much space, did very little
damage to the trees, so a pair of blues were added. From these were
bred a number of young, and very nice the small flock looked, shooting
round the aviary like a flight of blue and green arrows. The enclosure
being broad as well as long, they could keep up a sustained flight
by flying round and round, which was most attractive.
As a species, however, they did not do well. I think that the
proximity of the pond made things a bit damp for them in the winter.
At any rate, the mortality rate during cold weather from chills and
enteritis, was higher than the rate at which they bred during the
summer, and eventually they died out.
Cockatiels were the next Parrakeets to be tried, and these were,
after a bad start, quite successful. My first two were bought at a time
when Parrakeets were becoming very popular and Cockatiels were
" booming 55 . One had to telegraph a money order as soon as the
advertisement appeared if one wanted to have a chance of buying
them, and, as so often happens in these cases, I was doomed to dis-
appointment. True, I secured my Cockatiels, but on arrival it was
only too obvious that the hen was not a healthy bird. She appeared
to be suffering from some chronic complaint of a long-standing
nature, which might or might not be curable. As she did not seem
to be at death's door, I foolishly decided to risk keeping her to see if
she would improve, but she didn't, and eventually left her handsome
husband a widower.
Left on his own he became quite a songster, some of his notes
rivalling those of a Blackbird in mellowness. He took to serenading
the Budgerigars and, when he put his head down to be scratched,
they took a mischievous delight in pulling his yellow crest, which
I think, hurt his feelings in more senses than one.
To obtain a hen Cockatiel at that time was extremely difficult.
Odd hen Parrakeets were always at a premium, but eventually I
succeeded in finding someone who consented to sell one without my
having to buy a cock as well.
They bred a number of young, of which I kept a hen, and swapped

one of her brothers for another cock, thus giving me two unrelated
pairs for the following season's breeding.
Two breeding pairs together, even in such a large aviary, were
not a success. They agreed all right in the " off" season, but as the
Spring came round, the cocks bickered a good deal and the two
hens, after much quarrelling over the same nest-box, eventually
decided to compromise, and I found them both sitting side by side
on a double clutch of eggs in the one box.
This arrangement may have suited the feminine avian mind, but
the cocks had other ideas and, when it came to their turn to do the
" day shift " on the eggs, there was such a melee between all four birds
as to who should sit with whom, that I saw no future in the whole
affair, and separated the pairs.
By now I had manufactured several movable divisions for use in
the Spring to prevent cross-breeding between the Golden Amherst
Pheasants, so it was an easy matter to separate the Gockatiels.
From then on they behaved well and, at the end of the season I
had quite a flock of them. When they had finished breeding, the
divisions were taken down and both pairs and ali their young were
allowed the freedom of the whole aviary together. They agreed
perfectly then, and made a fine sight on the wing, having sufficient
room to show something of what Cockatiels can do in the way of
aerobatics.
This, one of their greatest charms, is entirely missed in the average
aviary, where they have only enough room to flap rather clumsily
to and fro.
They did a certain amount of harm to the growing trees, but not
as much as I expected. In any case their beauty and grace in flight,
and the delightful way in which they would hang upside down, all
together, in a shower of rain, dangling from the branches with spread
wings and tails, more than compensated me for the loss of some of the
leaves. I have a feeling that Parrakeets probably do less harm to
growing vegetation when in large aviaries, because they find other
things to do, and more space in which to do it, in mixed company.
Whittling of leaves and bark is probably as much an antidote to
boredom as a means of employing their beaks.
I cannot conclude this account of my Cockatiels without reference
to their biting powers.
They have a reputation for gentleness and inoffensiveness to other
birds, and this was amply borne out in my own experience, but woe
betide anyone who handled one carelessly ! They could bite like
rats and, once they got a hold, refused to let go, while they gnawed
their agonizing way into your finger. I would sooner have handled
a Broadtail of twice the size any day.
Having been successful with Cockatiels, I caught the prevailing

craze, and was fast becoming " Parrakeet conscious " Never
mind the plants, let's have some more of those birds which breed and
sell so well, and thereby help to maintain the cost of keeping the
others," was the feeling.
When, therefore, scanning the foreign bird advertisements in Cage
Birds (and was not this the first column we all read every week,
whether we had the money to buy or no ?), I saw a pair of Alexandrines
offered at what seemed a reasonable price, and hastened off to see
them. If anyone-had asked me, I should have said I had no intention
of buying until I was satisfied that they were worth it. As usual,
however, I think I had unconsciously bought them already for better
or for worse, because they became mine although not a particularly
good pair.
They were in a Parrot cage in a dealer's shop when I first saw them,
and not till I got them home did it become apparent that both had
been caged for some time. Neither could fly well, and both were
partly tame. At least it would be more correct to say they lacked
fear of human beings. When turned into the aviary they sat side by
side on a perch, watching me with their pearl eyes, and the hen, a
cantankerous old lady, made savage lunges at anyone who approached
too near.
Although in fair condition, they did not look a very promising
breeding proposition, particularly as they made no attempt to move
beyond their selected perch and the feeding tray.
Matters were considerably improved by giving them flying lessons.
That is to say they were induced to climb on to a stick held in front
of them, and then made to take short flights where they could land
and not hurt themselves. After one or two " pancake " landings, they
improved greatly, and eventually could do the length of the aviary,
albeit in a queer manner ; moving slowly through the air in a
perpendicular position with much laboured wing flapping ; rather
like someone, who is learning to swim? trying to do the breast-
stroke !
I only had them a year, during which time they readjusted them-
selves to a spacious aviary, but that is as far as they got. There was
never any evidence of attempted breeding, although suitable nest-
boxes were supplied. I don't even remember seeing the cock display
to the hen. Possibly she was too old to make him feel that way. She
was certainly the " boss " and a bad tempered one to boot. I could
well imagine her telling her nervous spouse to behave himself and not
to be such a fool, had he attempted to become amorous !
She loathed her flying lessons, largely, I think, because she always
failed in her attempts to bite me. She climbed on to the proffered
stick readily enough with one object in view, namely the fingers
that held it. With pupils contracted to mere pin points, always a

sign of intended wickedness, she used to make a rush along the stick,
knowing full well that I should let go before she got to my hand, when
she would be forced to the indignity of flying. She was another of
my bird characters who will always be remembered with amusement
and affection, in spite of her disposition.
The next and last Parrakeets to be kept in this aviary were Rosellas.
They consisted of a very fine pair, but like so many aviary-bred
Broadtails, they were as " wild as Hawks ".
For sheer brilliance and beauty, the cock was hard to beat, that is
to say whenever one had the chance to see him anywhere close to,
which was not often.
To me, one of the advantages of aviculture over bird watching in
the field is that you can, or should be able to, watch the ways of your
birds and admire their grace and beauty in comfort ; but with the
Rosellas one had to adopt more or less the field naturalist's methods of
hiding oneself away, and peering awkwardly from behind some
vantage point or other. If they knew you(R) were about they became
wary at once, and merely walked up and down a perch, pausing at
the end of each " turn " with one foot held up momentarily.
One does not want all one's birds finger tame, but it is nice to have
them sufficiently used to one to go about their affairs indifferent to
one's presence.
However, I was very proud of my Rosellas, and very excited when
they took to a grandfather clock nest, after having inspected it all
over and pressed their foreheads to it, a habit which Mr. Boosey
so aptly describes as " cooling their fevered brows ".
The hen became egg bound with her fifth egg, but in spite of this
appeared to incubate steadily. After many weeks had elapsed with
no apparent signs of young, inspection revealed a mass of eggs, none
of which were any good. She had evidently laid more than one
clutch in quick succession, and as usually happens in these cases
the hen is unable to cover them all. In her efforts to do so the eggs
consecutively get chilled and so none hatch.
Broadtails have a reputation for pugnacity. Consequently, when
they arrived, one of the partitions, which had hitherto been erected
only temporarily each Spring to separate the Golden and Amherst
Pheasants while laying, was made permanent, and they were put
into this on their own.
During the Autumn and Winter months, however, they were, for
various reasons, at times allowed to mix with the other birds, and the
following observations from memory on their behaviour towards them
may be interesting.
Cockatiels and Budgerigars were ignored. The Alexandrines
were respected because of their superior size and obviously stronger
beaks, but the Rosellas occasionally did their best to " bate " them

by approaching, one on each side, with much tail spreading, head
shaking, and " battle noises 55 . As an Alexandrine lunged at one
Rosella, the other would pull its tail from behind with a cry of triumph ;
then as the victim whirled in fury on its second tormentor, the first
would repeat the performance. The whole thing seemed more in the
nature of a mischievous game on the part of the Rosellas than genuine
spite, although the Alexandrines obviously lost their tempers as well
as their dignity ! I think that if they had been more active the
Rosellas would have respected them more.
Birds of other families were ignored. In fact, the Rosellas were
once put to route by my pair of Purple-headed Glossy Starlings,
because they showed too much interest in what had been the Starling's
nest-box back in the summer.
The behaviour of one isolated pair does not, of course, prove much
as to the general character of a species, although the above observa-
tions may be of help to anyone who is thinking of trying Rosellas in
mixed company.
It must be remembered, moreover : firstly, that the aviary was
spacious and the birds, even though of many different kinds, were
not forced into close proximity. Consequently risks could be taken
in associating species which one would never dare in small enclosures ;
secondly, the Rosellas' companions, even among the other Parrakeets,
in no way resembled them either in colour or behaviour ; thirdly,
that the Rosellas were only allowed to "mix" during the "off"
season, when avian tempers do not run so high as when they have
appropriated nesting territory.
Possibly Broadtails are only pugnacious towards members of their
own family. Be that as it may, the above facts are given merely from
personal experience, and are insufficient on which to form a definite
opinion.

Towards the end of 1939 1 lost the male of a breeding pair of
Crimson-wing Parrakeets (.Aprosmictus erythroptems ), and wishing to
replace him, was offered in exchange early in 1940 a male stated to
have been bred in 1939 by a member, and not yet in adult plumage.
When I saw this bird in its owner's aviaries it was living with a hen
Crimson-wing, also stated to have been bred in 1939 by the same
member.
The owner wished to exchange it as it had been rather ill-using
the hen, as is often the way with this species, though I should not
have thought he would have started so young.
The hen looked like an ordinary hen, or young Crimson-wing, but
the sex of the male, to my surprise, was very obvious ; several times
in the past I have purchased 5 4 hen " Crimson-wings which have
at their next moult moulted into fully adult male plumage, but until
then they were exactly like hens. This one, however, was quite
different, he was much brighter in colour than the hen, but only had
a crimson lower border to the closed wing and a jonquil yellow patch
over it ; the feathers of the upper back and interscapular region were
green, having a turquoise blue border to each feather.
Apart from these differences he was an undoubted male Crimson-
wing. He had been petted a lot and was rather aggressively .tame,
so I took him hoping that a much larger aviary and no petting would
soon make him turn to my hen instead of humans for companionship,
and thinking that he would probably moult into adult male Crimson-
wing plumage in the following autumn or the next.
I imagined that he was probably in a transitional stage from
juvenile to adult plumage, though I had not heard of such transitional
plumage before, but a friend of mine who has bred many told me
he had heard that it does occasionally occur. I was unable to examine
skins at South Kensington to see if a transitional stage was represented
there as they had been evacuated for safety, so I had no proof either
way, and I could find no reference to it in such books as were available.
He did not take to my hen very readily, and occasionally chased
her around, so his powers of flight were curtailed by clipping his wing
feathers, but even so, when the hen entered the nest and ultimately
laid, as she did, he followed her in, drove her out, and broken eggs
were the result. I had not seen him feeding her and do not think
pairing took place. His colours did not change when he moulted that
year (1940).
Till the spring of 1941 the pair lived together, but not on parti-
cularly friendly terms, as time went on he did feed her occasionally
but perfunctorily, and that year, when she entered the nest to lay,

followed her in, attacked her as before, and broke her first two eggs.
I then saw him pair with her and promptly removed him, and the
hen entered the nest and laid, but would not sit.
Wishing to know if the egg was fertile I transferred it to the only
other sitting Parrakeet I then had--a hen Stanley who had been
sitting a fortnight. I did not expect her to hatch it, there was much
discrepancy in the size of the eggs and it was " planted 55 so late, but
I wanted to know if the egg was fertile, chiefly to know if a male
Crimson-wing in immature plumage was capable of fertilizing. It
turned out that the egg was fertile, and a fortnight after the Stanley
hatched her own eggs she hatched the Crimson-wing egg, but failed
to rear the chick.
I still (November, 1945) have this bird, and have not attempted
to breed from him since ; he is still in the same coloured plumage
as he was in 1940 when I received him. I regarded him as a sort of
Peter Pan of Crimson-wings who had got stuck in a transitional
juvenile plumage, and wondered if war-time feeding--not so far
removed from peace-time feeding in his case--had anything to do
with it. In fact when Colonel Alan Lendon queried on page 35 of
the March-April issue of our magazine, 1945, whether there was any
record of a male Crimson-wing being known to breed while in immature
plumage I had thoughts of quoting this instance, but refrained from
doing so as in any case this was an abnormal bird with regard to
colouring, and from what I have learned since I am glad I did not
do so.
Recently, on passing one of the flights attached to the Parrot House
at the Zoo, my attention was arrested at the sight of a Crimson-wing
just like mine, only rather plucked here and there--it at once gave
rise to the thought that there was such a transitional plumage--till
I turned to look at the label on his aviary, which read : " Timor
Crimson-wing (Aprosmictus jonquillaceous) deposited 1939 ! " and so
I learned that I had unwittingly hatched a hybrid in 1941.
A friend has since told me that a few of these Timor Crimson-wings
arrived in this country in 1939, that he had had a pair, that the male,
like the Australian Crimson-wing, ill-used the hen and ultimately
killed her, and that he still has the male.
I can find no mention of this or any other importation of this
species anywhere.
The jonquil yellow patch on the wing and blue bordered feathers
on the back are certainly very beautiful, otherwise the bird is of the
same size, shape, manner of flight, and habits (in the aviary) as its
Australian relative.
This has, I suppose, added one more to the list of hybrids hatched
and incidentally brought out the truth of the dictum that what we
think is ignorance and only what we know is truth.

For some years we kept a pair of these rather interesting little
Buntings, which although they did not go to nest, gave one the
impression of being excellent doers in confinement.
Food , Hardiness , etc. --These examples thrived (the male regularly
coming into full colour) upon mixed seed, grain, and such insects
as they could procure, while as regards their hardiness they appeared
unmindful of cold, but required access to a shady retreat during the
summer months.
Snow Bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis )
For about four years we kept pairs of this northern species. They
are birds which require plenty of exercise and are apparently best
suited as to surroundings when kept in a roomy outdoor, and during
the summer months, partially shaded, cool aviary.
Breeding. --The females nest readily, but according to our experience,
owing to the heat or other causes proved most indifferent mothers,
and invariably allowed the young to die within the first week.
Nest. --Usually built in covered-in boxes, in one instance upon the
ground beneath a heap of stones, composed of dead grass, rootlets,
and plentifully lined with feathers.
Eggs. -- Five to six in number. Somewhat larger than those of a
Bullfinch. Bluish white in ground colour, and splashed with brick
red, a certain type of egg showing darker scrawls and markings.
Food. --This Bunting appears to require variety and an occasional
change of diet, otherwise the males fail to assume their full breeding
dress. The examples kept here had considerable opportunities of
procuring insects, etc., in addition to which they had access to mixed
seed, oats, and usually a pan of insectivorous food placed there for
other birds.

Smith's White-cheeked Bullfinch-Lark or Finch-Lark ( Eremopterix
leucotis smithii)
During the spring of 1909 we received direct from South Africa
a male and two females of this curious little Finch-Lark. As the
species is probably somewhat unfamiliar to aviculturists I may
begin by stating that the bird appears to be a sort of connecting link
between the Larks and the Finches, is about the size of a Hedge
Sparrow, and in appearance is chiefly remarkable for the male's
chestnut back, black breast, and conspicuous white cheeks.
Habits .--Perches at intervals, but prefers to spend a considerable
proportion of its time upon the bare ground.
Breeding. --These examples appear to be most persistent nesters, but
up to the time of writing (October, 1912), although young have been
hatched on several occasions, none have been reared, the parents
invariably neglecting them when some days old, to nest again.
Nest. --A cup-shaped hollow, rubbed out of the bare earth and
afterwards lined with fine dead grass, etc.
Eggs. --Two appears to form a clutch--the eggs laid by the two
females differing considerably ; those of one bird resembling a common
Whitethroat's eggs, and those from the other being thickly freckled
like a lark's.
Incubation. --Taken part in by both parents, ten days.
Nestlings. --Curious dark-skinned little objects, gape yellow, tongue
ornamented with three black spots.
Food. --Mixed seed, etc.
Hardiness. --These examples without ill effect live quite out of doors
until November, and are capable of wintering without artificial heat.
Wood Lark (. Lullula arborea)
Four examples of this rather local British species have been kept
in the aviaries here.
Habits , etc. --Thrived well in confinement, usually peaceable, but
during the breeding season quarrelsome (the males), even to the
extent of killing each other.
Breeding-- The four birds referred to proved to be all males, but at
least one perfect nest was built, and had we possessed both sexes the
probabilities are that the species would have bred.
Hardiness. --Hardy enough to winter in the county if protected from
severe frost.
Food-- Mixed seed, supplemented with a small daily allowance of
insectivorous food.
Black Lark (Melanocorypha yeltoniensis)
We possessed for a lengthy period two males of this rather handsome
species.

PREPARING A POST-WAR BOOK ON
PHEASANTS

(Reprinted from Modern Game Breeding and Hunting Club News)
After so many years of work with live Pheasants, I am now engaged
in preparing a new book on these wonderful birds, to be published
soon now the war is over. The object is to bring up to date and complete
the previous works of my old friend, Dr. William Beebe, his magnificent
Monograph and the more popular Pheasants , Their Lives and Homes.
As I am progressing with my task, all sorts of pleasant memories
come back to me. As far as I can remember, I have always lived with
Pheasants--as a few species were kept on my family's estate in Picardy
even before I was born. At the age of 16 I already possessed my
own Lady Amhersts, soon followed by Swinhoes and Grey Peacock
Pheasants. At 18 I had a complete collection of all the species then
existing in captivity, displayed in beautiful aviaries.
Pheasants had always been more popular, more extensively kept in
France than in any other country. Between i860 and 1914, a period of
great wealth and prosperity which the tragic episode of the first
German War in 1870-71 had hardly affected, the number of Pheasant
amateurs and breeders was considerable. Some were the owners of
sumptuous chateaux and parks, while others just kept a few birds in
humble back gardens. All were equally keen, and remarkable results
were obtained. It is due to them that the numerous species, to-day well
established, were acclimatized and propagated. They met with
extraordinary success in rearing Impeyan Monals, the five species of
Tragopans, Himalayan, and Yellow-necked Koklass, Argus, and
many others.
Before 1914, I had the chance to meet and know a number of these
old Pheasant men, then at the end of their careers. The Societe
d'Acclimatation, in Paris, was largely responsible for this enthusiasm
for Pheasant keeping. They encouraged the small breeders in import-
ing rare stock and loaning it to them. Practically all that we know of
the experiments made during this happy period is recorded in their

Bulletin , a most interesting source of information for aviculturists as
well as for all interested in practical zoology and botany.
I joined the Societe d'Acclimatation very early, and I have been
ever since closely associated with its work--the last fifteen years as a
Vice-President.
My first collection of Pheasants was lost in 1918, along with all my
other birds and plants, when my family place at Villers-Bretonneaux,
in Picardy, was completely destroyed by enemy action. In 1920
Cleres, in Normandy, had replaced Villers and another large collection
was soon gathered there.
I soon felt, however, that still more ought to be known about these
wonderful birds. Evidently new efforts also should be made to
re-introduce into our pheasantries a few of the rarer species : Cheers,
Coppers, and Mikados, lost during the war, and to procure new blood
in order to bolster up those which had become dangerously scarce and
inbred, such as the various Tragopans, Peacock-pheasants, Firebacks,
and Argus.
Above all, it was tremendously tempting to try to discover new
Pheasants, to import them alive along with several most beautiful
forms never before seen in pheasantries, and others which had long
died out in captivity.
French Indo-China, the least explored of the Oriental countries,
no doubt contained a wealth of rare Pheasants, some hardly, and others
perhaps not yet, known.
The Paris Museum alone possessed a few specimens of such rarity
as the lovely Edward's Pheasant from Annam. The fantastic Rheinart's
Crested Argus remained mysterious--something had to be done
about it.
I started in 1923 my series of expeditions to that marvellous country,
the seventh of which took place in 1939. They resulted in the dis-
covery of hundreds of new forms of birds, mammals, and other animals.
Furthermore, some of the most exciting and pleasant memories of my
whole life attach to these explorations. Luck was with me as on the
very first trip I discovered a startling new species : the Imperial
Pheasant. I was able to bring a pair of these priceless birds alive to
Cleres, where they bred the following year, as well as several pairs of
the exceedingly rare Edward's.
During the following years I brought home several Rheinart's
Argus which also reared their young at Cleres, and various recently
discovered forms such as Ghigi's Peacock-pheasant, Spedan Lewis's
and Berlioz's Kalijs, Taka-Tsukasa's Ringneck. Concurrently, I com-
missioned special collectors and I gradually procured in that way
a good stock of such desirable species as Mikado, Ijima's, Scintillating

In America, at the same time, Palawan Peacock Pheasants, the new
Moffit's Black Kalij, and the White-eared Pheasants became estab-
lished, and some eventually found their way to Cleres.
All these fine birds, obtained for the first time or reintroduced after
many years, have greatly enriched our pheasantries.
During the inter-wars period, a new peak was reached in the
popularity of Pheasants. Numerous naturalists and amateurs have
been studying, keeping, and rearing them, this time in different
countries all over the world. My close friend, Professor A. Ghigi, the
rector of the Bologna University, was among the most prominent
since the beginning of the century and headed the list in Italy. In
Belgium, M. Ivan Malisoux and Dr. J. M. Derscheid ; in England,
Mr. J. Spedan Lewis, G. Beever, P. Lambert, and Scott Hopkins. In
France, Mme. E. Lecallier and M. G. Jeanselme, to name only a
few, were particularly successful. Prince Taka-Tsukasa, Marquis
Kuroda, Marquis Hachisuka, and several others kept remarkable
collections in Japan. There were many other Pheasant lovers in
Continental Europe, in Australia, in India, South America, and
elsewhere.
In the United States Pheasant-breeding suddenly became wide-
spread. Mrs. Wikoff Smith, Dr. Newill, Messrs. C. Denley, C. L.
Sibley, L. Taylor, W. Mackensen, P. Plant, A. Tinker, F. Yessler, in
the East ; Mrs. Keith Spalding, Messrs. W. Leland Smith, P. Jackson,
F. Johnson, C. Hooke, J. Steinbeck, and several others in California
have been particularly conspicuous. Most of them are with us to-day,
and still possess an excellent stock of Pheasants. As it is to be feared
that the European collections are now sadly depleted, the world now
depends upon them for the conservation of the rarer species.
As a result of all the above-mentioned activities, a great deal has
been learned about Pheasants in the course of the last twenty-five
years, from observations in the field and in captivity, as also from
museum study. This is the reason which has prompted William
Beebe and myself to undertake a new synthesis of our joint experience
with Pheasants. This work will have a two-fold object : to bring
up to date our knowledge of the systematics, life habits, and
geographical distribution of the birds, and to supply the ever growing
numbers of Pheasant lovers with all the necessary data concerning the
birds in confinement.
Keeping and breeding Pheasants in captivity is not only an interest-
ing pastime and profitable occupation ; it has become in a sense a

r
moral obligation to civilized people--particularly in the comparative
safety of America. The future of these wonderful birds is dark indeed.
The ever easier penetration and the threatening destruction of their
natural habitats, the perfecting of weapons, the changes in the food
habits of native populations are sounding their downfall. Within the
next fifty years a large number of species will undoubtedly become
extinct if appropriate measures are not immediately taken to save them.
Fortunately, all Pheasants can be kept and reared in captivity.
It is the duty of both private individuals and public institutions to
organize more carefully their propagation and to do their utmost to
preserve for the joy, welfare, and the interest of future generations,
one of the most beautiful of Nature's marvels--the Pheasants.

Dr. Hopkinson having kept records of the Sunbirds as known to
Aviculture up to date, it seemed an opportune moment to add to his
article in the Magazine of 1933 nearly forty species and subspecies
that have been kept since, with references to literature and illustrations,
in the hope that at no distant date aviculturists may be returning to
the old love with renewed enthusiasm. Dr. Hopkinson has similar
records of all other groups, should any person be willing to edit them,
any or all.

' Much of interest in a Zoo is missed by those who give most exhibits only a super-
ficial examination. If more time is spent watching an animal, the visitor will very
likely be rewarded by seeing something that is overlooked by the casual passer-by.
(The term " animal " is here used in its correct comprehensive sense and might mean
reptile, bird, or mammal.)
Even a small Finch busily bathing itself is a sight well worth seeing or a parent
bird feeding its young. Among the larger animals also one may note various
idiosyncrasies of habit or movement if sufficient time is spent in observation.
Many species have habits or actions which are peculiar to their kind but it is
not always possible to assign a reason for such. If a bird inspects an object, first
with one eye and then with the other, such as a Magpie might do, it is obvious that
it is only making sure of seeing correctly that which holds its interest. On the other
hand, various species make movements or go through certain ritual performances,
the significance of which is obscure. This is specially notable in the avian world.

These observations are also applicable to various vocal noises produced by many
animals, often as accompaniments to certain stereotyped movements.
Generally speaking, the characteristics referred to can be divided into three

In this regard it might therefore be of interest to comment on a few observations
made in the Zoo.
Although we have mentioned characteristic movements of animals, the first
matter of interest referred to below, deals with lack of movement or counter-action
of movement. However, it rightly belongs to this subject.
A remarkable faculty possessed by some birds is the ability to hold the head
absolutely still, in relation to its surroundings, while the body moves. The Ostrich
exemplifies the application of this faculty in one form.
If some object attracts the bird's attention while walking, it can hold its head
immobile while the body is still being carried forward. When a certain distance
is traversed, the head is thrust forward, and again held stationary while the body
catches up, so to speak, the action being repeated according to requirements. In
these circumstances, if an observer can watch the Ostrich's head in relation to some
near-by fixed object, he cannot detect the slightest movement.
Holding the head steady, presumably enables the bird to more satisfactorily
watch an object of interest while permitting it to continue walking. The Ostrich
does not always utilize this faculty but does so if observing something calling for
special attention. On other occasions, when on the move, the head is carried forward
at the same constant speed as the body. When running the bird makes no effort
to hold the head still, this, no doubt, being practically impossible at speed.
Although the Cassowary, Emu, and Rhea are birds of very similar build to the
Ostrich, they apparently are not endowed with the same faculty.
The ability to hold the head still while the body moves is also possessed by other
species of birds, but is used for a different purpose. In this instance its application
enables a bird to counteract the movement of a swaying perch or bough on which it
might be sitting. Of course, there is a limit to the movement for which a bird can
make compensating adjustment, depending on the size of the bird and the travel of
the moving perch. Obviously, if a perch is making considerable movement, the
whole bird must move with it. However, where the bird can compensate for any
movement, it will again be noted that the head is absolutely rigid in relation to any
other fixed object. There may be two reasons for a bird in these circumstances
wishing to hold its head steady. As in the case of the Ostrich, one reason could be to
more effectively inspect an object of interest. The other might be an instinctive
act to prevent " seasickness " which may result from swaying of the head if too long
sustained.
This power of preventing movement of the head while the body is moving indicates
the provision by nature of some miracle of " automatic mechanism ". Doubtless
this is actuated by a stimulus received through the eyes. If this is so, presumably
the eyes are adjusted to certain fixed objects as " sights " to correct or prevent any
movement. If a bird is at the same time inspecting some object of interest, this
object might be used as a " sight ".
As the principles of the camera are largely copied from the eye, so also, it would
seem, recently invented range-finding instruments and the like, must be very similar
in principle to the " mechanism " with which birds are endowed for the purpose
mentioned.
It would be interesting to know whether a bird, having lost the sight of one eye,
could still exercise the faculty referred to, or whether this loss would render its
" mechanism " inoperative. The matter suggests an interesting field for investigation
and experiment.

The gratification with which I read the opening sentence of a recent
letter from our Editor stating that sufficient material has been collected
for a " Birds at Semi-Liberty " number of the Magazine was somewhat
dissipated by the further statement that " I feel it will not be complete
without a contribution from the originator of the idea
Even if one possessed the journalistic gift of making literary bricks
without straw, there would, rightly, be no scope for it in the
Avigultural Magazine, and my few straws of experience in keeping
birds under such conditions were exhausted in the original article . . .
which was written with the avowed intention of obtaining information
from others with wider experience in that direction.
Failing any contribution worthy of the occasion, I am hoping the
Editor will withhold the blue pencil and allow to stand an expression
of appreciation, which will certainly be shared by all our members, of
the very high standard maintained by the Magazine throughout the
war years, when she was faced with such a combination of difficulties
that one with less ability and determination would have given up in
despair.
The average aviculturist can only be induced to contribute articles
dealing with birds then, or recently, under observation, but each
succeeding year of war reduced the number of such contributors and,
even now, the prospects of replenishing our grass-grown aviaries in the
near future are not too bright.
Within the past few months I have unwillingly joined the ranks of
the birdless ones with the loss, after seven years of semi-liberty, of
" Joey ", my beloved little Senegal Parrot. His end is still a mystery.
An hour after he had been seen on his accustomed place at the kitchen
window he had completely disappeared, and an exhaustive search

failed to reveal as much as a green or orange feather anywhere, nor
was there any response to the repeated calls to which, on former
occasions when a sudden fright had induced him to take flight, he had
always responded.
To record the loss of such a friend in feathers might well be taken as
a warning to those who still possess any to preserve their pets within the
comparative safety of cage or aviary, rather than risk a like loss by
allowing them even semi-liberty.
But for myself I think otherwise, and still believe the pleasure to
be derived from birds so kept far outweighs the risk it entails, and that
every other "Joey " would agree with me that, had they the choice,
they would vote for the freedom with the risk rather than captivity
without it.
In aviculture, as in life, those who will take no risks are like to miss
the best it has to give.

REDRUMP PARRAKEETS AT LIBERTY
By M. D. England
In 1942 I made some trials with the Redrump Parrakeet (Psephotus
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.997074" page_id="56288810"  page_num="38" year="" vol="">
hamatonotus) at liberty. The male of pair A was liberated for periods
of about an hour several times a day, while his mate was on eggs and
chicks, by simply leaving the aviary door open. The hen made no
attempt to leave the aviary. He fed on or near the ground, so far as I
could see chiefly on dandelion, sorrel, and chickweed, and returned at
intervals to feed his mate or young. Seven eggs, five young reared.
The cock of pair B had complete liberty during the egg and young
stage, a small door being left permanently open. Again the hen made
no attempt to leave. He ranged over a much wider area than cock A,
and roosted in a high elm 200 yards from the aviary. This led to his
undoing, for one night a Tawny Owl had him. The hen reared the
young alone. Seven eggs, three reared (six fertile, but three dead in
shell).
Pair G provided an expensive experiment. They were kept without
a nest-box, and one morning were liberated together , a number of nest-
boxes having been put up in the garden. They immediately set out for
Australia, and within a minute were specks on the horizon.
It is noteworthy that although the three aviaries were within ten
yards of each other, no fights or even " visitations " took place.
Nothing could be more beautiful than a cock Redrump flying about
the garden, and provided he is shut in at night he appears to make an
ideal liberty bird.

We are, I suppose, most of us creatures of circumstance, so that now,
except for periods of leave, I have been an exile for more than thirty
years ; for five- years of that the war is responsible and throughout all
these years I have never possessed an aviary. I did think when I came
here to do what, I then thought, was the last five years of my service,
that I might have an aviary, but the experience of those who had tried
was not encouraging. Snakes will get through half-inch mesh wire
netting, though after having swallowed a bird, they cannot get out.
Only a few days ago we found a snake, which had in some manner got
into the converted stable where I keep my birds, half in and half out of
a&apos; cage where there had been two Black-headed Munias, and where
now there was only one, at least outside the snake. The swelling in the
snake which showed where the other unfortunate was, had prevented
the snake from withdrawing by the same way it had entered and so we
slew it. These two Black-headed Munias were both cocks and as I
could not in wartime get hens for them, I repeatedly let them go, but
they tried so hard to get back into their cage that I had, perforce, to
open the cage-door. The surviving cock has now a hen. Nevertheless,
there appears to me a sinister beauty about a snake as it moves, like
flowing water, over the ground. Again, ants will invade the nests of
birds and destroy the young, and there is a wall lizard, larger than the
familiar wall lizard of the house, which will creep sideways through
the wires of a cage even if only half-inch apart, and it is then good-bye
to any eggs. Again, the salt winds here so quickly corrode ordinary
wire netting that it will soon rust and crumble beneath the fingers.
So I decided that even now I would not possess an aviary and that
I must be content with cages. I had fine wire gauze fitted in the doors
of a converted stable. I had my cages placed on trestle tables and on
the floor were the bamboo cages in which I kept my Grey and Black
Partridges and from which every day they were released. Now I have
a pair of Chukors in a big double bamboo cage and these, too, are
released in the garden and return to their cage, tamer than a barndoor
fowl.
With the War, however, my interest turned to Homer Pigeons
which I bred, and though Pigeons are not, I understand, proper
subjects for the Avicultural Magazine, for like Canaries and
Budgerigars they are domesticated, they are in my view the ideal
liberty bird and if we could breed the homing instinct into other birds,
then we might see flocks of Turquoisines, Many colours, and Splendids
winging their way to their home loft. How far more lovely than a
flock of bombers. This is, however, pure phantasy, but so strong is the
homing instinct in Homer Pigeons that when, by mistake, the Sergeant

who used to train my birds caught up a young hen but six weeks old
and released her with the older and trained birds some seventeen miles
away, in hilly country, difficult country for Homer Pigeons, while the
trained birds returned the same evening, the young hen returned alone
the following day. I believe the Manx Shearwater has the homing
instinct very highly developed but one does not keep Manx Shearwater
as pets. But where this homing instinct does exist or can be bred, the
problem of your liberty bird returning, enemies permitting, is solved.
In my view, however, one of the most charming liberty birds is the
Grey Francolin or Grey Partridge, as it is called here. This bird is
associated with my earliest years in India, and, even now at times, my
memory reaches back over the dividing years, and I am a young man
again, riding through the fields from village to village, among a friendly
and a happy people ; my ideals are still undimmed, my illusions are
not yet destroyed, and I still believe that a man is his brother's keeper ;
then the rising sun disperses the morning mists and over the quiet
fields comes the clear ringing call of the cock Grey Partridge, a brave
and challenging call. But that is far away and long ago. How swiftly
the River of Life flows under the Bridge of Time. The Grey Partridge
is a favourite pet in. India, particularly among a class known as
" Bhayas ", of whom many are watchmen and gardeners. The birds
are caught when a few days old and reared on white ants and, as I have
discovered recently, on the tiny maggots of the house fly, and on bajri,
a small greenish seed of the millet family, crushed finely. It is useless
trying to tame a half- or a full-grown bird ; it is not only useless, but it
is cruel and it is not done in India. These birds are kept in bamboo
cages divided into two compartments, one for the cock and one for the
hen and the cages, which are small for the size of the bird, each com-
partment being only about twelve inches square, are not the prisons
but the homes of the birds. The cage doors can be opened and the
birds readily return on a call from their master. Indeed, in the country
districts one can see at times the proud owner walking along a road
carrying the double bamboo cage, in which there is one bird, while the
other runs along behind, stopping occasionally to dust itself or pick
up a morsel of food and then running at speed to join its master. These
tame birds often breed and when I go on tour in the cold weather,
should I be in Sukkur in Upper Sind in February, I go and see the mali
or gardener in the Government garden, to ask how his Partridges are
and he will take me into a small, quiet room in his small house of
unburnt bricks and there, in the corner of the room, in a wooden box
such as you get or used to get at any grocers, upon her nest made on a
foundation of leaf mould and dried grass, sitting as quietly as any old
hen, will be a hen Grey Partridge. The top of the box is protected by
an old piece of stout wire netting, and morning and evening the bird
will be taken off her eggs for a stroll in the garden. The cock bird will

help to rear the young and I myself have seen this brave bird drive
off a Shikra or Sparrowhawk which tried to seize one of the chicks.
The chicks wander under the protection of the parent birds in the
garden and about the outhouses, and a pretty sight it is ; and what is
more, the mail sells the young at ten rupees a pair. Grey Partridges are,
in my opinion, lovely birds, with their soft autumn colouring of browns
and greys, and their happy contented murmurings as they feed. They
are kept for fighting as well as for their call, but the fighting is not very
serious and I remember the grief there was in this same place, Sukkur,
when one of the local champions, a lovely bird, was showing itself off
to a circle of its human admirers when a Goshawk suddenly swooped
down from a tree in the park, where this little exhibition was going on,
and carried away that Partridge worth two hundred rupees. Oh !
the sighs and lamentations. I myself have reared the Grey Partridge,
the hen sitting in her bamboo cage in a small room on the ground floor
of the bungalow, leading into a veranda, leading in its turn into the
garden. When the young hatched, after the first few days, under the
care of one of my orderlies, the little procession of mother and her young
with father bringing up the rear, would make its way to the tomato
beds, where under the foliage the birds would find shelter and pro-
tection and a certain amount of food, and would dust themselves and
sun themselves in the soft earth. When the sun got really hot the little
procession would re-form and return in the same order under the
protection of their devoted attendant to the little room.
Black Partridges are not so easy to keep but they are lovely birds.
They seem to me more to resemble a Pheasant with their lovely black
and silver spangled plumage and the rich brown collar. The hen differs
markedly from the cock, being coloured much like a hen Pheasant,
and I have found the hens more difficult to keep than the cocks.
Perhaps I have not given them sufficient green and insect food ; they
are very fond of grasshoppers. The call of the Black Partridge is not
so musical as that of the Grey. It is a harsh call, but not without charm
as it is repeated, every few minutes in the early morning, as bird answers
bird across the wide 44 kachas " as they are called, the flat lands
bordering the Indus watered by the flooding river, which receding,
leaves the forested lands, forested with the picturesque lai or tamarisk
trees, refreshed and ready for the sowing of crops in the clearings ; or
one can, if one is fortunate, as one rides slowly along on a cold fresh
winter's morning, see a cock bird, in all his beauty, calling from an
anthill or some hillock. The pious interpret the call as 44 Subhan teri
Khudrat " or 44 Omnipotent, thy Power ", while the vulgar say the
bird is calling 44 Lahsan, piay, adrak " that is "garlic, onion, ginger".
The English imitation is 44 be quick, pay your debts ". The birds are
kept not for fighting, as the Grey, but for use as decoys in the shooting
of wild birds and indeed, it was on this trait of pugnacity I relied in

bringing my Black Partridge cocks home, when the hen died and I was
left with two tame cocks. These were reared from tiny chicks and,
indeed, were so tame that when the mail carried the one in a cage, the
free bird would follow, pecking at the malVs legs. When one was
released in the morning, it would soar upwards with that soaring flight
so well known to shooting men--I will not call them sportsmen--and
then would glide on open wings to earth, when it would strut about
looking for fresh worlds to conquer. After two or three hours the bird
would return to its cage, placed near the cage of its friend and rival,
who would in turn be released. I have only heard of their breeding in
captivity once and I did not see the birds myself, but I was told they
were kept in a wire-netting enclosure in a garden and that one cock
was kept with two or three hens ; for the truth of this I cannot vouch.
The Black Partridge is not fed like the Grey on hard seed, but on
various kinds of pulse or dal soaked for twenty-four hours and the
water then drained off. Chukor are fed in the same way. I had my
birds for some years until a too eager childish hand released both birds
at once ; then the unaccustomed noise of a children's party frightened
the birds ; they stayed out late and, I think, jackals got them.
This trait of pugnacity can be used to bring home liberty birds, and
I remember reading, many years ago, a very entertaining letter in the
columns of Cage Birds in which the writer, writing of his experiences in
China, told how he had followed some Chinese bird fanciers to their
meeting place, an open plain, and there they let their larks sing one
against the other. The cages were made with movable tops, just as a
dish cover fits over a dish ; the birds' cages were covered with cloth ;
one cage would be uncovered and the top lifted off and the bird
released. Away he would go singing in the heavens, then, after a proper
interval of time, another caged bird would be uncovered ; he would
sing against his rival in the sky; down this one would swoop and over
him would be popped the top of the cage and he would be safely
" home There seems nothing improbable in this.
Chukor are also kept as pets for fighting and for their call but more
often further north than Sind, and I have at present a pair sent to me
from Baluchistan; and I gave another pair to the son of my motor
driver, also a Baluchi. Both pairs when sent to me were in poor con-
dition, their primaries had all been plucked and though they were
tame, they could not fly. My pair were put in a large double-domed
cage made from bamboo, each compartment measuring 24 in. by
24 in ; the base is 12 in. high, and a further 10 in. to the top of the
dome. In this roomy cage I sometimes kept my Black Partridges.
The Chukor were released in the mornings separately, until in the
course of time they grew their flight feathers and the cock bird now
flies to the roof of the house, whence he calls. The pair I gave to the
motor driver's son receive the most constant care, and though each

compartment of their cage is only a foot square, with the usual pyramid-
shaped top, the birds are given dust and sun baths every day, and when
I remarked the other day on their good condition, the boy replied,
" But if one has the love of birds in one's heart, they thrive." I thought
this was very true. Chukor are fed here the same way as Black
Partridges, though they will eat bajri, but not juwar or dari ; they will
also eat a paste made of wholemeal flour and water and broken into
pellets, which they will take from the hand. This food is also given
to young Grey Partridges after they are a few weeks old.
It is obvious, I think, that hand-reared birds are better subjects for
" homing " than others, and I think it probable that the tame Shamas
about which one reads in our Magazine, are hand reared. I know
most of the Shamas sold in the bird market in Bombay are so reared
and I knew of one that was so tame that it was sold more than once to
too trusting bird lovers, who charmed by the bird's tameness, which
when released would, at the snap of its master's fingers, fly upon his
outstretched hand, would buy the bird and release it; when away it
flew home to " master ". It was, as a matter of custom, sold only to
people in the near neighbourhood, but I suspect the owner sold it once
too often.
The Common or House Myna is easily reared by hand on a paste
made of parched gram flour and I think the Starling family ideal
subjects for liberty birds. I think the Common Myna a most charming
bird, with its rufous and black plumage, its bright yellow bill, ear
patches and feet, and its confident strutting gait and its noisy chuckles.
One a servant hand-reared was so tame that it would come and perch
on one's shoulder as one moved about the garden, but its very tameness
was its undoing and a hawk took it, amidst the lamentations of the
compound. Bulbuls, again, when hand-reared make most charming
pets and will fly about the house and garden until the spring comes
and mating time. But I have now a pair of White-cheeked Bulbuls
which were caught as young birds of the year and will not leave me.
I think I have in another article told how, when I started to breed
Homer Pigeons, I released some of my other birds and how this pair
of Bulbuls must have been trapped and caged by a stranger, and how
some months after, with plumage all bedraggled and scarcely able to
fly, they came back to me and when I put out their cage, they entered
it with every sign of happiness and bathed and fed as they had not
done for weeks. I have the birds still and only this year the hen must,
I think, have laid six clutches ; two nests the pair built in the garden
in a casuarina hedge but each time the eggs were taken ; I suspect
Crows ; and four times they built in a basket in their cage, a shallow
basket about five inches in diameter, filled with coconut fibre which I
hollowed out in the centre ; and in this the birds built a nest of the
leaves, like pine needles, of the casuarina tree. Once they hatched one

young but I was away and no special food was given and it lived only
five days ; then three young were hatched, but something was wrong
with the feeding and after thriving for seven days the young faded away.
Still the parent birds are with me and when strangers come and the
dogs bark, they add their alarm notes to the general uproar. They are
quite members of the family and fly from their cage whenever anyone
opens the door ; but they always return. I have, I know, written before
of one of the most charming pets I have ever had ; a Crested Yellow-
cheeked Tit, which reared by hand, accompanied me, in its small
bamboo cage when I went on circuit and from which he (or was it a
she ?) was released as soon as we had settled in the Travellers 5 bungalow.
This charming bird would always return within a few hours though
released at different places as we moved on tour.
Not all members of our Society would, I think, be prepared to show
the devotion to their birds which others practise. I remember once
meeting a most charming gentleman who was so devoted to his birds
that he and his family lived in the outhouses and the birds in the
bungalow. The bay window of the best room was wired in and
occupied by Peafowl. In volume 31 of the Journal of the Bombay Natural

the natives of Sylhet and Cachar, who keep them as fighting birds
and often wager considerable sums on the results of the battles. With
the Sylhetis, indeed, these birds often take an even higher rank than
do fighting cocks. Wild birds are said not to be so good at fighting as
those which are reared by the natives from the eggs, so for this reason
the eggs are taken and hatched by the natives. The most usual manner
in which this is done is for the man or his wife to carry them about all
day fastened to his or her stomach by a cloth. The heat thus engendered
seems to be ample for the purpose of incubation and I am informed
that at least two out of the three eggs, which escape being smashed,
hatch out all right. 55
But I have also found in a favourite book of mine, published as
long ago as 1895, The Bird , by the French historian, Jules Michelet,
a more seemly passage, relating to the domestication of birds. It is as
follows :--
" To recreate all the conditions of abode, food, vegetable environ-
ment, the harmonies of every kind which shall deceive the exile into
a forgetfulness of his country is not only a scientific question but a task
of ingenious invention. To determine the limit of slavery, of freedom,
of alliance and collaboration with ourselves, proper for each individual
creature, is one of the gravest subjects which can occupy us.

This account of a few different species of birds kept in conditions
of semi-liberty will be begun by a few general observations in a form
of a summary, and then enlarged upon. This may seem contrary to
the general rule--but it will allow me to keep somewhere within the
region of true observations gained through personal experience.

I always associate " birds of intelligence " with those that are the
wildest and most cunning in their wild state. These birds are generally
termed as vermin and there is no doubt their depredations to the
agricultural and game preserves are enormous, but their ability of
becoming to the human being the same as the " His Master's Voice "
dog (after they have been fully and completely reared by hand to
maturity from almost nude babies) is little short of amazing. One
year, many years ago, we reared by hand over fifty of an assortment of
Carrion Crows, Magpies, Jays, Rooks, and Jackdaws and they all had
their absolute liberty from the day they left their " foster " nests.
When feeding time arrived or, as was more often the case, they felt
hungry, they would descend in a flock of varying colours on to one's
shoulders opening their beaks and giving their baby's call. Incidentally,
I doubt if they ever lose this baby touch--or perhaps it may be the
female element that sticks to it (with apologies to our Editor). No
matter to what age they live, and they are really of the right nature for
hand rearing, they never do. This is a point worthy of physiological
study as some individuals of all species of British birds (from the same
nests even) are as different in character as all other living things on
God's earth.
This little flock of birds gradually diminished after they had learnt
to hunt food for themselves--but those that chose to stay around and
to ask for their food always had it. The others sat up in the trees calling
occasionally, but well and cunning enough to keep out of reach.

46 V. A. V. CARR-SOME BRITISH BIRDS AT SEMI-LIBERTY
The causes of the diminution of birds that have been trained to
domestic life are many--the chief being open water butts, half or three
parts full; which they never seem to be able to resist. Another evil is
the sportsman with a gun, and thirdly " friendly 5 5 neighbours with a
desire to keep a pet in a cage.
As an experiment this mass rearing of such species of birds to keep
at complete liberty proved the hopelessness of dealing with such a wide
range of varying characters, as they did not individually receive the
affection that a few inevitably do. So then it got to the stage of a pair
of Carrion Crows to be reared and trained, and they make the most
amusing pets one could wish for. They delight in swooping down from
a height and pecking the tail of some yapping terrier and hovering
for another sneak attack. Rooks are more thoughtful and like to walk
about in slow, long strides and thoughtfully probing with their long
beaks into the mystic depths of a lawn S Jays think it good fun to
hover in the woodland, seemingly enjoying the mobbing birds but
secretly scared to death. Then they will make a sudden swoop at one's
cigarette and fly away with the right end in the right place.
Magpies are more vicious and like a good peck at a stockingless leg
or a lunge at one's ear or fingers, hiding bits of food in their long throats,
then regurgitating and placing it under a stone.
Jackdaws have the most loving nature but delight in daylight
robberies.
Ravens are extremely handsome birds to have " waddling " about.
I have seen them in remote Welsh farms reared by some member of
the farmer's family, and as long as they are treated gently and not
frightened (this, by the way, applies to all birds) they will be like the
poor (in the old days), always with us.
(b) Migratory Birds. --Such birds as Nightingales, Tree Pipits, and
Blackcaps will not go far away when at liberty, but the huge drawback
to these birds is their migratory instincts. They must be off no matter
what happens and one cannot possibly allow them their liberty for very
long.
(c) Finches are difficult to hand-rear to such a late age as compared
to soft-bills and the keeping of birds at semi-liberty without the hand-
rearing stage cannot be very satisfactory. We have had aviary doors
blow open under severe gale conditions allowing all the inmates to
escape, but a large proportion have returned to their same quarters.
This may be due to feeding habits, not necessarily homing instincts.
(d) Canaries are the least intelligent of all birds in the open, and
hopeless in any idea of direction or self-preservation.
One Budgerigar which my sister laboriously reared by hand was
exceptionally intelligent. He was at full liberty and never attempted
to go out of the district. He made marvellous flights, flying very high
and swift. This bird was kept at semi-liberty for two years, and when

he was out in a terrific gale he completely disappeared and was never
heard or seen again (unfortunately).
The Barbary Dove is very handsome and when crossed with the Wild
Turtle Dove the resulting hybrid is pretty, fertile, and more intelligent,
but these birds have no knowledge of the warning notes of other birds
and always finish their liberty in the claws of the agile Sparrowhawk.
I think hawks specialize in Doves for food in this locality.
To sum up, then, may I make these observations. If anyone
interested in the advancement of the science of ornithology wants to
gain more knowledge of the workings of a bird's brain, he should hand-
rear and tend these birds in the same way as a man and his dog.
How often one hears the remark that Mr. X has a Magpie which
is always sitting on his shoulder he must be a crank, whereas in
actual fact the knowledge that owner gains from such a pet is
incalculable.

I, however, enclose a list of birds I have had at liberty at one time or
another, not for weeks or months, but for years; now, alas ! all dead
except for a Starling. All the birds were cocks and, as long as one
was about the house and garden and they could hear one's footsteps
or voice, they would never stray far. I may add this was entirely
affection for me as I rarely fed them myself, only doing the aviary
birds--my man doing " the house birds ", i.e. those that had cages
in the house and were allowed full liberty in the day time. I find hens
unsatisfactory as they always look for mates in the spring. Cock birds,
on the other hand, " mate " to those humans they have been hand-
reared by or to whom they have taken an extreme liking--this I
have found the general rule. The following list of birds I have kept
at liberty are : Short-eared Owl, Jackdaw, Wood Pigeon, Goldfinch,

Rose-breasted Cockatoo, Sulphur-crested Cockatoo, Leadbeater's
Cockatoo, Swainsons Lorikeet, Curassow (the red-billed var.), Guan,
Chough (Cornish), Glossy Starling, Japanese Starling, Common
Starling, Formosan Magpie, Japanese Magpie (this not a very satis-
factory bird, rather inclined to stray like most of the Magpies and Jays
--the Rooks, Crows, etc., are good stayers), Toucan, Raven, Common
Hangnest, Song Thrush. All the above birds were " foolproof" tame
and most of them, as I said before, lived for years. I found their
greatest enemies were fools with guns, waterbutts and other people's
dogs.

(Trochalopterum canorum)
By A. H. Isenberg and T. F. M. Williamson
Early in the century a fire of considerable extent broke out in the
Chinese quarter of the City of Honolulu, in consequence of which
many of these Thrushes, Hwa-mei or " flower-eye ", as the Chinese
call them, gained their liberty, whether by intention or not on the
part of their owners no one knows. At any rate by 1916 the valleys on
the Island of Oahu on which Honolulu is situated, resounded with their
song. Mr. Isenberg, who spent a great part of his youth in the Hawaiian
Islands, observed their accidental naturalization with much interest,
and later on introduced them successfully on the Island of Kauai,
where they are now quite common. Later when he acquired his present
home at Woodside, California, these early successes prompted him to
see if he could not repeat them here, and a visit of M. Jean Delacour
about two months ago has resulted in this article, in the hope that it
may be of interest to at least some of the members.
In the latter part of 1941 ten of these birds were purchased with the
idea of liberating them the following spring. Unfortunately about a
week after they were turned into one of the aviaries fighting broke
out among them, with the result that four of them were so badly
injured that they succumbed and a fifth was so crippled that it was
useless to liberate him. As no other aviary was available into which to
turn them, and to avoid further loss, the door was opened and they
were allowed to go. At the same time an old male, a very fine songster,
who had been at Woodside for a number of years and who was ringed,
was let out. The house and flower garden are surrounded on the north
and south by streams, that on the south always having water in it, and
its banks, which form a gully, are thickly covered with brush and trees
such as live oak, Monterey pine, alder, willow, butterfly-bush, and
cottonwood. It extends for some miles both to the east and west, and
the birds took up their residence on its banks at once. They were fed
all through the winter in the aviary from which they were liberated,
but as spring came round that gradually ceased and any feeding that
was done was of a more casual nature. In a very short time they learned
to come to our whistle. They are not really shy but thread their way so
rapidly through the densest brush, flitting and hopping that it is often
difficult to follow them and they are all round one before one realizes it.
Their song can only be described as wonderful, especially in the early
morning and evening, and so preoccupied are they with it that they
are more easily approached then than at any other time. They always

choose a tree from which to sing their full song, though a sweet whisper-
ing sort of song can often be heard from the brush. The old male above-
mentioned always answers our whistle with a few sweet notes, and is
always on the look out for peanuts or mealworms though, except in
the breeding season he prefers the former. There are many aviaries at
Woodside which contain a large variety of soft-billed birds, and one or
two Spectacled Thrushes are always kept so that the ones at liberty
may not stray away. They seem to sing nearly the whole of the year
round except during the moult and nesting period which lasts here
from April to the end of July, though even in these critical periods
bursts of somewhat subdued song may be heard. The opinion of the
writers is that the song of these birds, though, of course, individuals
vary, is fuller and sweeter than any other that they have heard, but,
of course, they are only giving their personal views and everyone may
not agree.
As regards breeding : in the spring and summer of 1941 eight young
from one pair were observed. Later in the year only three birds were
seen always together. In all probability the young were driven off by
the parents or vermin may have got them. Unfortunately the woods
round Woodside are pretty well stocked with vermin of all sorts,
racoons, skunks, foxes, Eagle Owls, and hawks, not to mention that
villain the common rat and many nests are robbed. Shooting and
trapping do little good as so soon as one offender is caught another
appears to take his place. We had almost forgotten to mention the grey
squirrel, whom one of us saw capture one of the Thrushes and maul it so
severely before it could be driven off that the bird soon died.
In 1942 we only saw four young, but could hear birds singing far up
the stream. In 1943 five young were seen and in 1945 we counted
ten birds together and flying one after another across the stream.
This year we know of five young being reared from the first nest and
at last birds are heard singing all round and at a considerable distance
away. So it would appear that we do not see all the birds hatched,
though we hear many of them and we think that a conservative estimate
of the Spectacled Thrushes at liberty would be from sixteen to twenty.
However that may be, there is no doubt in our minds that they are well
established.
The nests we have found vary as to site. One was in the centre of a
scrub oak thicket, another in an ivy-covered oak some twenty feet from
the ground. These were all composed of leaves, roots, and hair and
were pretty bulky affairs. Three to five blue eggs appear to be the
average clutch and incubation lasts about fourteen days. The male bird
appears to do most of the foraging for the family. The old male will
come begging for mealworms and we have seen him pick up fifteen at a
time, fly off a short distance put them down and repack them before
taking them to the nest. He carefully killed each one. On throwing

him more worms than he could carry away at once he would first kill
them all, carry off what he could, and return for the rest. He also carried
pound cake to the young. The female came not nearly so often as the
male and would be content with four or five worms. The young will
also take worms and cake when they leave the nest, but they are shy,
won't leave the brush, and things have to be thrown to them. They are
fed by their parents for a considerable time after they leave the nest.
Their beaks are noticably shorter than those of the adults, their tails
quite short and their breasts speckled. Females are indistinguishable
from males except by their call note, a descending whistle, repeated
several times.
In conclusion, we do not think that Spectacled Thrushes at liberty
are harmful to other birds. We have seen them on the feeding tray
eating in perfect harmony with such small birds as Song Sparrows,
Chickadees, Titmice, Wren Tits, and the like, though whether they
rob nests or not we do not know. Be that as it may, we are glad that
we have succeeded in establishing them if only to be cheered in dark
days and fine by that wonderful song.

My experiences of birds at semi-liberty are very limited. Most of
them have been too precious to allow them to brave the many hazards
of the English countryside.
If they are really tame, this means that they have lost one of their
most valuable assets in a free state---fear of man---and they almost
invariably sooner or later come to grief by human hands, either by
capture or some " sportsman's 55 gun.
If they are not tame, except in the case of certain large species whose
aerial manoeuvres may be worth watching, they are disappointing at
liberty, as one can seldom approach them closer than one would the
average wild bird. Moreover if they are at all striking in appearance
they run the same risk as the tame bird of being trapped or shot.
Assuming that one keeps birds for the pleasure of watching and
admiring them at close quarters, to let them loose seems to me rather
to defeat the object of bird-keeping.
There is, however, one exception to this argument, and that is the
letting out of breeding pairs of insectivorous species which have young
to feed. According to the interesting accounts which appear from time
to time from those who successfully breed softbills, the easiest way to
ensure a continuous supply of live insect food, without which they fail

to rear their young, is to let the parents out to collect their own.
Moreover, this method would appear, from all accounts, to keep the
cock sufficiently occupied outside the aviary not to turn out his off-
spring from the nest prematurely in his eagerness to make his mate go
to nest again.
In spite of the foregoing remarks, however, I have kept a few tame
birds at semi-liberty and while they lived they were a source of pleasure.
To my mind, a bird to be really enjoyed in a free state should be
hand tame. A lot of fun may then be had with such specimens,
especially if they are of the larger species and make a good show on the
wing. Such a bird or birds can be easily controlled and shut up safely,
out of harm's way, when danger threatens or nobody is about to keep
an eye on them.
Even then they sooner or later seem to meet a " sticky end " as the
following stories of my few liberty birds will show.
" Jock " was a Jackdaw, taken from a nest in the hollow limb of an
elm tree in Esher. When he first arrived at my home in Northwood he
was a fat mass of newly sprouted black feathers, with pale blue eyes,
a large yellow-edged gape, and an equally large voice. He was still a
bit unsteady on his legs, so was placed in a small straw-lined basket,
where he stayed for some days before showing any inclination to move
about on his own.
Having hand-reared various small birds at different times in the past,
I found this big one just too easy. He would swallow anything, includ-
ing one's finger or the handle of a dessert spoon which was used to
shovel food down his red gullet.
He required feeding every two hours from dawn to sunset, and, as I
was at that time away from home during the day, rather than burden
some other member of the family with the job of feeding him, I decided
to take him to and from London with me.
His basket was wrapped up to look like an ordinary parcel in order
to attract as little attention as possible, but therein I was not always
successful. He soon learned that the sound of the human voice
probably meant food, and should anyone with whom I might be
travelling happen to speak, he was often answered with a series of
squawks which froze everyone in the railway carriage into an
embarrassed silence. It was not always realized that the noise came
from the brown paper parcel on the luggage rack, and many were the
curious and covert glances cast in my general direction !
When he had fledged he soon learned to feed himself and could be
left at home, but he still liked to be fed by hand for quite a time after-
wards. It was during this period that he was trained to fly at liberty
and return when called.
At first his short flights were within the garden boundaries, but soon
were extended all over the district.

52 D. H. S. RISDON-MY EXPERIENCE OF LIBERTY BIRDS
Although he would always return at the sound of my voice if within
earshot, he was very apt to treat all human beings as providers of food,
and more than one timid citizen received rather a shock when a
Jackdaw appeared from nowhere, alighted on his shoulder and
squawked into his ear with a large open beak.
When he was about three months old he showed a tendency to
stray further and further from home. I suppose it was the instinct
which seems to urge the young of many species to leave the breeding
territory and seek pastures new. First he would spend a night away
and turn up the following morning, and then on one occasion he
didn't turn up again.
Exhaustive inquiries eventually traced him to a house where he was
the centre of an admiring family in the kitchen. Although obviously
enjoying such an appreciative audience he recognized me at once and
let me bring him home.
He was the only bird I have ever known which could be taken for
walks. Sometimes on one's shoulder, sometimes flying ahead from tree
to tree, and sometimes dogging one's footsteps with his jaunty swagger
he made an amusing companion.
At about this time he learnt to say his own name, and could repeat
the phrase " Come on " which I invariably used when calling him.
It was amusing to hear him, perched somewhere on his own, practising
and repeating to himself over and over again " Jock ! Jock !
Come on ! "
One day he disappeared, as I thought for good and all, and this time
inquiries failed to reveal his whereabouts. I thought that he must have
reverted to a wild life and began to forget about him.
Three months later I was walking down the garden when I noticed
a Jackdaw which flew on to a branch ahead of me. It seemed unusually
tame and appeared to be eyeing me uncertainly. Suddenly I realized
who it was and called him by name, whereupon he flew immediately
to my shoulder with his old squawk of welcome.
He had obviously been a prisoner somewhere, as his condition was
not so good and he could not fly as well as when I had seen him last.
I was surprised at his remembering me after so long. He was about
four months old when I lost him and barely through his first moult,
and three months' absence is a long time in the life of a young bird
still developing.
After this he was kept in an aviary along with a Magpie, a Jay, and
several foreign Pies and Jays of his own size.
He was evidently one of those birds whose constant association with
human beings had made him believe he was " one of them ". His
aviary companions were ignored and, when he was at liberty, as he
always was when I was around to keep an eye on him, he took no
notice whatever of the wild Jackdaws. The only bird he did love to

tease was Polly, my African Grey Parrot. Her red tail was the
attraction. She was fond of pottering about the veranda in her own
quiet way, and while doing so, like all " old maid 55 Parrots, was
imbued with the idea of founding a family. This took the form of
poking her head into odd corners, tail in the air, and then scratching
the ground first with one foot and then the other, as if scraping out a
hollow in some imaginary nest.
Here was Jock's chance and, swooping down, he would give her
tail a most unmerciful tweak. Round would swing Polly, every feather
.bristling with outraged indignation, but by that time the Jackdaw
would be half-way across the garden.
He was really a coward and would never face up to her. If only
she could have been about ten times as quick " on the draw " she
might have taught him a lesson. As it was she would go back to resume
her " nesting " with a sinister rendering of a human chuckle such as
only a Grey Parrot can do.
The following year, when Jock became adult, it was fairly evident
that he was a cock ; but did he take an interest in the opposite sex of
his own species ? Not a bit of it ! Any woman or child was entertained
to a display which should by rights have been reserved only for a hen
Jackdaw, as with ruffled feathers, dropped wings, and spread tail he
ran round and round them with little mincing steps, quite unlike his
normal swaggering stride.
Children he loved, largely I think because of their excited squeals
and giggles as he flew from head to head or dashed in among their
scurrying feet as they ran home from school.
He lived with me for two and a half years and then the inevitable
tragedy overtook him. Although a garden pet, he liked entering people's
houses, and this, I think, was the indirect cause of his untimely end.
Whether he had been up to some mischief and incurred the wrath
of a householder, or whether some wretched boy with an airgun did
the deed will never be known, but one day he came home and flew
as usual to the aviary to be let in. I thought his flight seemed a bit
lopsided and he seemed obviously in distress as he hopped through the
opened doorway without noticing me as he generally did. Then I saw
the wound in his breast and a wet stain on the black feathers.
Examination showed a shot wound and the pellet was evidently
buried inside him. Extraction was obviously impossible so there was
nothing to do but wait and see what happened, in the hope that perhaps
the pellet was not lodged in a vital part. This, however, proved to be
the case, and he died the next day.
Another bird which I had at liberty for a few weeks, until it reverted to
the wild, was a Greenfinch. This was picked up with another one below
some chestnut trees. Some disaster had evidently overtaken the nest, as
the two fledgelings were only partly feathered and quite unable to fly.

54 D. H. S. RISDON-MY EXPERIENCE OF LIBERTY BIRDS
As I had a brood of Canaries of the same age at the time, I took the
two young Greenfinches home, intending to see whether the Canaries
would rear them along with their own young.
Shortly after this one of the Greenfinches vomited blood and then
died. The fall from the nest had evidently been too much for it. The
Canaries did not seem very keen on the remaining one so I decided to
hand-rear it.
As soon as it fledged I put it in a cage which was daily carried into
the garden and the door left open, so that it could come and go as it
pleased.
While still being hand-fed it would come at once to one's call. One
never quite knew where it would be in the garden, as its colouring was a
perfect camouflage against foliage, but as soon as it heard the tap of
the feeding stick against the food bowl, with an answering chirp, down
it would come to be fed.
Even when it became independent it remained quite tame for a
while, would come at one's call, and would return each evening to its
cage to be taken indoors. Gradually, however, it seemed to become
more aloof and stayed away for longer and longer intervals. Then
one morning it flew off as usual on being released and never came back.
I think that if one wishes to make permanent liberty birds of hand-
reared specimens, it is necessary to curtail their freedom during their
first late summer and autumn. It is during this time that most young
birds tend to leave the district in which they were bred and form
themselves into large flocks which roam the countryside with no fixed
abode. Your tame young bird will feel the urge to join his wild brethren
and will be off unless you prevent him doing so.
My only other liberty bird was a Barbary Dove, which used to roam
the district where I lived and come back to its cage in the garden to
be fed. It frequented a neighbour's poultry run a good deal in company
with some wild Turtle Doves, to which it used to display, but they would
have none of it and would fly off. I think it would have followed them,
but their going was so swift that the Barbary never quite realized the
fact that they had gone until it was too late ! It used to cover quite a
lot of ground in its wanderings ; as I realized one day when I heard it
cooing in a pine tree, quite a mile from home.
Although Barbary Doves look such half-doped things in a cage, they
are remarkably active when they are allowed the room, and their flight
at liberty is swift and sure. I think this bird eventually got caught or
else killed by a cat or an owl. It did not always roost in its cage and
on one occasion, after a night out, it turned up the next day literally
scalped. It recovered completely from this attack, new skin and feathers
entirely covering the wound, but some months later it again roosted
out somewhere, and this time it never came back.
Thus ends my tale of liberty birds, but who knows what the future

holds ? I think, if my dreams came true, I would have an island in
some warm, sunny clime, devoid of men with guns, cats, rats, stoats,
and weasels whereon one could keep at liberty all one's avian treasures
with some chance of success.

There is no doubt that, of all wild creatures, birds make the most
delightful pets ; however, in my opinion, to afford real pleasure to
the owner there needs to be a voluntary attachment on the part of
the creature, which holds it far more satisfactorily than bars and
patent fastenings do. This applies especially to birds, since free flight
is one of their main charms to us, and one of the main sources of
enjoyment to themselves. Mankind when fettered, can still enjoy
the pleasures of mind and study, the varieties of literature, arts and
handcrafts ; but to the lesser creation provision of food and shelter
alone is a very poor compensation for the loss of movement and
society of their kind.
To tame an adult bird, such as Robin, Finch, or Blackbird, by gradual
patience in garden contacts, gives perhaps the most pleasing results ;
but it sometimes happens that a fledgeling of some sort becomes
orphaned, and is then well worth rearing for a pet. The following are
some examples of my own experiences in this way.
One red-letter day a friend took me for a duck-punt outing on one
of the Norfolk Broads nature reserves. It was May ; a frozen dawn
developed into a day of unstinted sunshine, and the breeze had a true
East Anglian bite in it. A prevailing chorus from waders and warblers
was occasionally punctuated by the dim boom of a Bittern. In the
course of our watery tour, the keeper turned us aside to put out of
action a newly established unwanted colony of Black-headed Gulls
. . . unwanted because of their rapacious treatment of rarer sorts of
fellow nesters in the area. Heaped up cradles of sedge, containing two
or three handsomely mottled greeny brown eggs apiece, one after
another the clutches were smashed with the end of the punt pole.
In just one nest out of the two dozen or so, sat demurely a newly
hatched first-born, like a little chicken with duckling's feet, and black
spots all over his soft grey down. Of course we begged for the life of
this Moses ... it was readily granted. I took him home with me to
Derbyshire the next day, hoping to rear him on a judicious menu of
raw liver and meat, brown bread sop, as many fresh ants' eggs as
could be obtained, and chopped lettuce and fescue heads to provide
needful vitamins.

On these he throve, and at the age of three days began to " follow
the plough 5 5 when I was gardening, and pick up grubs and small worms
on his own account. He also horrified me by picking up and swallowing
large bits of the concrete path, until I realized that these were to be
the false teeth for his gizzard. Periodically he would discard some well-
worn gravel and proceed to pick up a new outfit. At a week old
he could tackle an apple core and bring up a neat casting of its
remains.
An outsize saucer on the lawn enabled him to indulge in six thorough
baths a day ; and it was also a pretty sight to see the little fellow
swimming buoyantly about on the surface of my own cold morning
bath in the house. This he enjoyed, but appeared to be quite nervous
of the vaster waters of our garden swimming pool, even at a much more
advanced age. I sometimes wondered what his reaction to the sea
itself would be hereafter.
Growing rapidly, feathers of a dark and still protective coloration
began to supersede the spotted down. At about seven weeks the long
wing feathers were fully developed, and Moses took to the air. It was
a joy to see him wheeling and circling over the garden. On the ground
he was gentle and sedate, not apt to be frolicsome like many young
creatures are. He much liked to be talked to and petted ; and when
my sister's children came to stay with us a spirit of jealousy was plainly
manifest, and that in due proportion to their ages, the smallest one
being attacked the most fiercely by him. This led to his partial in-
carceration in the fruit cage. Whether it was owing to the double
vexation, or whether to a natural seasonal tendency to shift away from
the old breeding-ground, I cannot tell, but he began to take far longer
flights, and joining up with a young Gull bred on the neighbouring
moors finally returned no more. We consoled ourselves by thinking
of his enjoyment of the fuller life which had claimed him.
In spring the Magpies of the Peakland valleys were troublesome in
levying raids on our garden nests, particularly on the Thrushes. So
once I returned the attention on them, and removed a queer little
object from one of their thorny robber strongholds on the opposite
hill-side. Dalgetty was somewhat like a black-and-white kitten, very
short bodied, no tail, and mounted on extra long shiny black legs, on
which he would prance along uncertainly on slippery stretches of
linoleum. About that time a high wind blew a fledgeling Rook out of
his beech-top nursery, and so we brought up the pair of them together,
mainly on liver, and on worms, slugs, and lurking creepy-crawlies for
which we left no stone unturned. The gale that blew Barnaby down,
appeared to have also given him a bad cold in the larynx. For some
weeks, though developing well otherwise, he suffered from total loss of
voice, and could only caw in a discreet whisper. When in course of
time his caw returned in full force, we were rather sorry in some ways.

It was an ear-splitting ordeal to have him give tongue from his favourite
perch on our shoulders.
Dalgetty grew a long tail, shot with iridescent green and purple.
They were good companions, but an amusing contrast in character.
Offer both a strawberry simultaneously, when they had swooped down
out of the blue to be fed. The Magpie would snap up his own and
Barnaby's as well, while the latter was still thinking how much he was
going to enjoy it. Owing to their taste for flying away with the day's
newspaper, or casually depositing such items as ankle socks and gloves
on the roof of the house, they were relegated at times to an empty
stable. Although entirely tame and friendly, with autumn came to
them the same urge that Moses had, to join their own kith, and after an
occasional return, thenceforward they were no longer mine.
The only bird pet who ever did come back faithfully year after year,
was a Woodpigeon, reared from the nest, and named Boreas from the
June snowstorm that whitened his native moorland fir-copse. Every
spring he and a wild mate would raise a brood or so of wild children in
our plantation. They all shunned publicity, but he himself would
strut placidly around, feeding with the tame Fantails. Only on one
occasion did he enter our house. That was seeking dumbly for relief
after having been shot in the thigh. This fortunately enabled me to
catch and take him to the doctor, who, after we had plucked away the
feathers, set the shattered drumstick with small splints and strips of
plaster, poor Boreas gripping me tightly round the finger during these
painful proceedings. After keeping him in a chicken run for some
weeks, the splints were removed, and he resumed his free life, sound in
wind and limb, though with a slight limp discernible whenever he
hurried his portly walk. The next spring and summer he was with us as
usual, but the year following, which would have been the fifth or sixth,
he never reappeared. No doubt those last winter wanderings had been
met with a charge of shot that was fatal.
Another year a young Kestrel was passed on to me, his boy owner,
who had reared him, being able to keep him no longer. Kester was a
most friendly creature from the first. Conversing in sharp, squeaky
tones, he loved to sit on my shoulder and tweak my hair ; and when
fed would either try to fly away still clasping the finger he had been
perched on, or else take his food up on to my head to enjoy picking it to
pieces there ... a habit which had to be firmly vetoed ! Liver (so easily
obtainable in pre-war days) and raw chicken necks were his main diet,
supplemented by trapped mice and small bird and vole casualties
picked up along motor roads. Although perfectly tame, when given
full freedom in the " back-end ", he took it gratefully, evidently con-
sidering a hunt for his own living much preferable to a sheltered and
spoon-fed existence.
So did the two Tawny Owls, Puffball and Mopsa, which I had the

next year, after their tree nursery had been untimely rent asunder by a
gale. Perhaps it was owing to having each other for company, and by
reason, too, of their nocturnal habits, but they were never confiding
like Kester was. Flying down to receive food from the hand was as far
as they ever got, and woe betide that hand if unprotected by a leather
glove, for blood-piercing was the grip of their talons, though they only
snapped and nibbled most gently with their hooked beaks. Owls kill
with their claws in one fierce snatch, and then swallow the prey whole
(which much simplifies meals on dark nights). Falcons carry off their
prize to a convenient spot, hold it down by foot, and then tear it into
shreds with the sharp beak which has already done the killing. It was
interesting being able to contrast the ways of the two species. Both had
in common remarkably silent flight, owing to the down on their flight
feathers which acted as the muffling on pirate's oars. . . . The descend-
ants of Puffball and Mopsa still inhabit the fir plantations to which
they escaped as soon as the stable door was left open.
A minor road casualty with an injured leg joint, when barely
emerged from the nest, a young Greenfinch next claimed foster-
parental care. Making himself at home at once in a flannelled box,
he got the name of " Pip " from his continual Great Expectations.
Even after bedtime, his transparent little crop bulging with the last
meal of bread-and-caterpillar, up would come a sleepy head with a
very wide crimson gape, hoping for more. Cabbage caterpillars are
apt to have a harmful effect on some sorts of young birds. I got Pip's
from the hazel hedges, folded in neatly doubled leaves, that we called
his love-letters.
Greenfinches, as families, remain very united for some weeks after
the nest is left ; you see the parents being closely pursued, with little
husky cries of " parri, parri ". Whenever I took Pip in the garden he
was never happy unless following or perching on me. But by August
came the larger flock instinct. One day he was missing. After coming
back on the next one, as if to let me know that he was well and happy,
he was off again, and permanently, to the wild and the fallow-field life.
Commonest and plainest of all birds, yet a Sparrow raised from the
nest or from a gutter-pipe fall makes a more amusing companion than
many of the rarer sorts. Character and decision they have in plenty.
When Charles, who would come flying in at the open window on sound
of the breakfast bell, was presented with a thick slice of bread and
marmalade or jam tart, being unable to compass the whole (as he
saw us doing) with his little beak, he would take alternate pecks of
bread and sips of butter or jam. With a sultana he used his beak side-
ways and scissor-wise to cut through its skin. He would then descend
from my wrist and go systematically round the table picking up crumbs,
a useful domestic aid.
James was even tamer, and he loved to nestle long in a willing hand,

or in the little caves left among bed-clothes at rising time. Once he
made an upward rush to nestle in a friend's hearty yawn ! Alas, his
very tameness was his undoing, squatting on a dark mat, where a heed-
less foot brought sudden disaster. In spite of their saucy independence
and hardihood, Sparrows are certainly capable of a most real and
touching affection to their owners. Of course there is always much more
individuality and variety of character among birds of the same species
than one is apt to realize without close and sympathetic personal
contact. That is what makes taming them so interesting, and it also
makes one averse to cramp their short lives by bars, pinionings, or
anything but a merely transient fetter. As I work on the land I often
fill in times of monotony with revisualizing old days and friends, and
among them see again the engaging ways of the smaller feathered ones,
some of whose careers I have thus briefly outlined.

Most of the observations made in this article upon the subject of
birds kept at semi-liberty at Warblington, near Havant, at Peasmarsh,
near Rye, and at Hayward's Heath must already have appeared in
accounts by the Marquis of Tavistock in the volumes of the
Avicultural Magazine between the years 1924 and 1939.
Not everyone, however, will have ready access to these volumes, and
so it may be worth while to recount the experiments made with a
number of species of foreign birds as they occur to an imperfect
memory, for I have not all the volumes and those I have are away
being bound. The experiments took three main forms ; there were
the birds which were allowed out by day only (because of the danger
of their being taken at night by Owls, or, in the case of the Finches in
winter, to be sure of their roosting in a warm shelter) and were not
fed outside ; those which were allowed out all the time were fed in
two types of trap cage, and could fairly readily be caught up, and those
which were liberated through a trap door in the aviary roof, and were
trained to come back into the aviary shelter to feed or to roost as they
pleased. These last were under the least control because they could not
be so easily caught. During winter a number of cock Parrakeets were
liberated mainly with the object of maintaining or improving their
fertility. Their hens were kept in the outdoor aviaries and altogether
the arrangement worked very successfully, but whether these birds
would have stayed so well had they been let out in pairs one cannot,
of course, tell. The birds so treated were King Parrakeets, Crimson-

<bodyText confidence="0.999731288888889" page_id="56288832"  page_num="60" year="" vol="">
winged, including the young cocks of the year, were let out every
morning, and at mid-day an inward pointing funnel of wire-netting
was put into position in the small feeding door at the front of the aviary
flight through which the birds had gone out, so that when they came
back to feed they could not find their way out again.
For some time before being let out for the first time the birds, which
were normally fed inside the shelter, were fed just inside the small
feeding door in the flight, and that was all the training that was either
practicable or necessary. Only one, a bright youth among the Crimson-
winged, ever found its way out through the funnel. They, together
with one or two hybrid Crimson-winged X Sula Island Kings, were all
housed in one aviary which had a much larger shelter than the ordinary
ones. The small door was, of course, closed at night to prevent the
entry of rats.
One winter morning after the birds had been let out there came a
blizzard and some of the Barraband's were lost, one or two being seen
later in the Isle of Wight, but none was recovered alive. The Black-
tailed were the most spectacular flyers and it was a wonderful sight
to see them dashing at great speed through the leafless trees.
Altogether this plan worked admirably, and provided the birds did
not find any food outside all were safely inside the aviary by mid-
afternoon. In the Spring the adult birds were returned to their mates
and only the young ones were allowed their day liberty.
Cock Kings, the Broad-tails and Ring-necked were trained to feed
in a large feeding-box, something like 4 ft. by 2 ft. by 2 ft., having at
one end a small entrance hole and at the other a basin of seed which
was replenished by means of a small door at the back. The bottom was
covered with half-inch mesh wire-netting and it was fairly dark inside,
while a hinged wooden screen prevented any bird from seeing the
basin of food from the entrance, so it was only the birds which had
been trained to feed in such a box that ever thought of going inside,
though, if I remember rightly, one or two of the young Crimson-winged
did find the way in, and it sometimes happened that Sparrows went
in to feed, but these latter were caught, before they brought too many
friends, by the fixing of a sliding door, operated by string, which closed
the entrance.
The box stood on the top of an aviary : it was fitted with four legs
(set at an angle to give a firm base) each having a square of zinc
fitted at the top to prevent the ascent of rats. The box was stayed
with wire to adjacent aviaries to prevent its being overturned by
strong winds.
The training of the birds was done by means of a box similar in
appearance to the one outside, but having to start with the whole
front open so that the basin of food was plainly visible. Then day by
day a board was added until only the entrance hole remained as a

means of entry, and then the hinged screen was arranged so that the
basin was no longer visible from the perch at the entrance.
The training took something like ten or twelve days to complete,
and with some birds it was necessary to proceed very cautiously towards
the end of the training, the screen proving a very baffling factor even to
birds which would enter readily enough so long as the basin could be
seen from the entrance. The box had, of course, an arrangement of
perches inside whereby birds could walk from the entrance to the basin.
The whole arrangement was not so involved as the description might
make it appear and altogether it worked very well indeed.
Red-rumped Parrakeets were kept at liberty and they stayed and
bred well and for some reason were not troubled by the Owls. Masked
Lovebirds did well, if I remember rightly, but did not breed. Red-
faced Lovebirds also stayed well but did not breed. The smaller
birds were fed in a trap cage, a semi-circular topped affair about
3 ft. by i ft. 6 in. hinged to a base and having an inner lining of string-
netting spaced off from the wire-netting so as to prevent the birds,
whenever they were caught, from injuring themselves.
Inside was a tray of seed mixture and it was necessary to change this
seed fairly often, particularly in wet weather because, of course, it was
quite exposed to the weather and soon sprouted or turned sour after
being made wet.
In winter the mixture contained no Canary seed or millet because of
the various Finches, which were trained to go into a warmed shelter at
night. The trap was enclosed by a hinged frame covered with i J in.
wire-netting which kept out the larger Parrakeets, and it stood on a
stand about six feet from the ground, the legs each being fitted with a
square of zinc to prevent rats from climbing up,
The trap which, of course, operated freely inside the cover, was
propped up by a piece of wood, about three or four inches long, so that
the drop was quickly accomplished and there was little risk of a bird
being crushed. Joined to the prop was a length of fishing-line (which
withstood the weather far better than ordinary string would have done),
which was carried to a hide some thirty or forty yards distant. The
line, unless carefully arranged, gave some trouble because it was, of
course, important to keep it fairly taut so as not to have to pull up any
slack line before throwing the trap, for naturally the birds were alarmed
by any movement of the line.
At intervals of about ten yards it was necessary to have props to
take the weight of the line and a compensating weight fixed at the hide
end which allowed for slackening in dry weather and tightening in wet,
so the line was always just taut enough, yet there was never (unless
something went wrong) enough tension on it to pull away the support-
ing prop and throw the trap.
Tits and Nuthatches took a good deal of the seed, but when the Tits

became too troublesome we caught some and liberated them a mile or
two off, but I think many of them eventually came back, while the
Sparrows were used as food for Owls in the collection.
A similar trap feeding-cage was used in summer for the various
Finches, the outer cover being of i in. mesh wire-netting which excluded
most of the wild birds. It was rarely necessary to catch any of the
foreign birds and, of course, Sparrows were only caught when no foreign
birds were inside feeding with them.
Green Budgerigars stayed well at Warblington and bred, the young
being caught up when they were independent of the parents. A few
Yellow and Blue ones did not long survive. Blue-Crowned and Vernal
Hanging Parrakeets were kept successfully at liberty all one summer,
but they stayed in the tree tops and were only to be seen when feeding
or flying swiftly from one tree to another.
A very tame Masked Parrakeet stayed about the garden, going into
an aviary through a door in the roof to feed. Great-billed Parrakeets
also stayed well and fed in the same way : they were much more active
at liberty than in cage or aviary. A cock Alexandrine and a tame
Layard's did not stay long, while a cock Blue-bonnet did not stay at all,
and was last seen flying hard in the direction of its native land.
Rainbow Buntings stayed but did not breed, while a few Virginian
Cardinals were a failure.
A cock Gang-Gang Cockatoo stayed well and did not, so far as we
knew, damage the trees. A Western Black Cockatoo which escaped at
Peasmarsh went off at once and was not heard of again, though a tame
specimen of a near relative, the Banksian, stayed well at Woburn Abbey.
Some of the White Cockatoos were, of course, kept successfully at liberty
at Cleres as were some of the Macaws which must have been a fine sight.
A cock Yellow-bellied Parrakeet was liberated two or three winters
at Warblington, each time going off until early the following spring,
when he reappeared to visit his mate more and more frequently until
he was caught up at the end of March. He continued to do this at
Peasmarsh, but at last he was, we heard, shot some distance off by a
gamekeeper who mistook him for a hawk--a quite excusable mistake
for anyone not knowing Broadtails.
Some of the Broadtails were inclined to fight with the others in the
aviaries and the cock Brown's lost its upper mandible through fighting
with a Barnard's through the wire-netting. I thought the cock Kings
quite the best liberty Parrakeet for staying about the garden and being
most often on view : they and the Pennant's made a bright show
against the green lawn or the evergreen trees.

The Weavers went off each summer, returning in the autumn, and I
think they may have bred in some marshland near by. The cocks in
colour made a bright show perched on their favourite bushes. The
Fire-finches stayed about the garden and were fairly tame. They often
picked about on the paths and for this reason no weed-killer other than
agricultural salt was used.
The sexes of the Zebra Finches were separated in winter and only the
cocks were let out each morning into the garden. Before the Finches
were let out they were trained in the aviary to go into the pigeon-hole
of the shelter through a small inward-pointing wire funnel. A tray of
seed was fixed both inside and outside the hole and after a time no
more seed was put outside, the wire funnel put in place each day and
the birds, seeing the food inside, went through without any difficulty.
In the side of the aviary, high up, there was a panel covered with 1 in.
mesh wire-netting on the outside and a movable panel covered with
\ in. netting fitted inside, a narrow ledge fixed on both sides for the
birds to perch on, so that when the time came to let them out all that
was necessary was to take down the inside panel.
Food was kept inside the shelter all the summer so the birds, or many
of them, continued to go in and out of the aviary a good deal. Gorse
bushes were fixed high up in the shelter and kept there all the year
round, being, of course, renewed from time to time, but none of the
birds ever nested inside. In the autumn the wire funnel was placed in
position each day at about mid-day and at the same time the seed
mixture outside in the trap was gradually discontinued, so that by the
time the nights became really cold all the birds were roosting inside.
At Peasmarsh conditions were not so favourable for the smaller
liberty birds, for though the garden was quiet enough, there were many
grey squirrels, stoats, weasels, Owls, rats, Jays, and Magpies about. A
pair of Royal Starlings were liberated there, but they soon went off.
At Hayward's Heath the liberty birds did quite as well as at Warbling-
ton, and Budgerigars of several colours did considerably better, possibly
because they were not let out until they were nesting, when they went
in and out of the aviary roof as they pleased.
No doubt there are great possibilities in the keeping of suitable
birds at semi-liberty in all its variations, including the letting out of
insectivorous birds when they have young in the nest as had already
been so successfully done with the Blue Robins. The same treatment
might be successful with many seed-eating birds, particularly those
which rear their young largely on insect life, though on the whole they
probably would not be so quick at finding their way in and out of a
small hole in the aviary netting. Some Parrakeets might be trouble-
some in summer and autumn by reason of their fondness for fruit,
particularly neighbours' fruit.
When liberating birds it is very important to allow them to come

out quietly and of their own accord as early in the morning as possible
so that they do not stray by reason of being frightened and have all the
day in which to find the food.
If a number are to be let out, it might be a good plan to liberate
about half their number at a time so that those still inside tend to keep
the others about by their calls, and when those outside are quite at
home in their new surroundings, they tend to keep the others about and
to help them to find the food, when after a few days they in their turn
are let out.
It is very important, too, to be sure that the birds are finding the
food and to provide water for them, for hunger and thirst will be more
certain to drive them off than to keep them about. The feeding
arrangements must be made to exclude as far as possible the wild
birds, for otherwise very much more food will be required, and any
small birds for which it is intended may be driven off. In addition to
the careful observation of these rules, I expect success depends a great
deal on the locality and whether one has a quiet garden with suitable
cover, not too many Brown Owls, cats, and what gamekeepers call
vermin which, from the avicultural view, might sometimes include the
gamekeeper himself.

BIRDS AT SEMI-LIBERTY AT VILLERS-
BRETONNEUX AND AT CLERES (1905-1940)

Every aviculturist, I should say, has at the least occasionally
dreamed, if not tried, to release some of his pets and to keep them
around his house at semi- or total liberty. I shall only mention casually
as kept at semi-liberty all the pinioned birds that inhabit, or, alas !
inhabited in the more civilized days of a recent past, so many gardens
and parks surrounded by fences. Cranes and Waterfowl were the most
popular.
This way of keeping many of the larger birds is too widespread to
be enlarged upon. Pheasants, Peafowl, Turkeys, Guineafowl, Brush
Turkeys, and other game birds are also commonly kept under similar
conditions, but with them escapes are frequent as they occasionally
get over the fences from a high perch, or by climbing up the wire-
netting.
Many of these birds can also all be kept even in a more natural way
if they have the use of their wings. Non-migratory waterfowl and
Cranes can easily be induced to stay full winged if the surroundings
are suitable and roomy enough. With less sedentary species it is
often possible to keep the male of a pair full-winged while his mate

cannot fly. At Cleres we were successful in keeping various Cranes
and Screamers in such a way.
Small waders, such as Ruffs and Reeves, Curlews, Godwits, and
Plovers, as well as Cattle Egrets, look very charming on a lawn during
the spring and summer, when they find enough worms and insects
to thrive happily. But it is a problem to winter them. We found that
whenever these common birds are obtainable, it works very well to
acquire a number of them early in the season and to turn them out
into the gardens (when cats, rats, and other pests can be kept down)
after pulling out some of the primaries of one wing. In a few weeks
the feathers are grown again and the birds begin to fly. By that time
they have become tame and accustomed to their surroundings, to
which they form a marvellous addition. In the autumn, when the
weather becomes cold and the food scarce, they leave for the south
and join their wild brethren migrating from the north. We used also
to keep at Cleres at liberty in the garden various other pinioned
waders, the most conspicuous of which were a dozen or more Scarlet
Ibises. These were always in brilliant red dress, as the natural food
they found supplied them with the necessary colouring element. They
proved much hardier than one could expect, being only confined to
a small yard, with an unheated shelter, during the four coldest months
of the year.
Blue Porphyries will also do well under such conditions, and they
look very beautiful, but they cannot be recommended as they are
terrible nest-robbers and soon prove to be a great nuisance.
Parrots, Pigeons, and small birds have been tried by several of my
friends, particularly the Duke of Bedford and Mr. A. Ezra, with better
success than I ever met. I kept some, however, on many occasions.
Crested and Tigrine Doves did well, as also a few other species, but Brown
Owls always decimated them during the winter. At various times Red
Cardinals, Rice Grackles, and Rufous-necked Weavers stayed well and
even reared young. The Weavers remained well over three years. Pekin
Robins, White-crested Jay-Thrushes always disappeared promptly.
I always had several free flying Macaws, including Hyacinths,
Great Black Cockatoos ; various Amazons and Conures also lived at
liberty for many years. Other Cockatoos, I found too destructive to
trees and buildings and we never could keep free for long.
All this is a thing of the past at Cleres. But Mr. F. E. Fooks is back
there, and this past has a fair chance to be partly revived in the near
future. As a link, I hear that a Festive Amazon, which we brought
over from South America and liberated in 1921, is still to-day flying
around the Manor House and the terrace. If he could talk better than
he does, he would no doubt tell much, and some of his stories would
probably bring tears to all my friends who knew Cleres in its former
splendour.

BLACK-HEADED SIBIAS AND OTHER BIRDS
AT SEMI-LIBERTY

By A. Sheriff, F.Z.S.
It seems so long since the aviaries were occupied that I had quite a
thrill on receiving our Editor's letter asking if I would write on " Birds
at semi-liberty ", with special reference to the Black-headed Sibia
(Icioptilia capistrata ).
As a preface I would say how glad I was to have given all my birds
to the Dudley Zoo at the outbreak of war for, apart from the difficulty
of feeding, the aviaries, as such, do not now exist, thanks to the missiles
that the Hun dropped around our neighbourhood. Now, instead, the
derelict buildings house a few chickens, who do occasionally lay an egg.
But to return to the subject, in the 1903 edition of the Avicultural
Magazine, the late Mr. Reginald Phillips gave an account of a near-
success in breeding Black-headed Sibias. There is an excellent plate
in this volume which does adequate justice to the beauty of these birds.
One point, however, I want to alter my opinion expressed in the first
article written in 1925, and to disagree with the late Mr. Phillips on
the question of sex difference. In the first pair, which reared young,
I could always distinguish the cock from the hen, but having since
that time bred nearly twenty and had many more through the aviaries,
both my wife and myself are satisfied that there is no visible sex
difference. Whistler, in his Handbook on Birds of India , says " sexes
alike They are found throughout the Himalayas, even up to the
snow line.
Of all the many species of foreign birds which have passed through
the aviaries, excluding Parrots, the Black-headed Sibia shows, in my
opinion, the greatest intelligence of any, with the possible exception
of the Racquet-tailed Drongo. They are active, cheerful, and when
at liberty a real delight. The late Mr. Phillips described the chasing
of the cock by the hen in the breeding season, and it is amazing
to see how they avoid crashing into trees or wire. They are adept
at catching meal-worms when thrown into the air and although not
perching on one's hands, will fly to take the meal-worms from the
fingers.
I do not now remember in which year the first pair bred at liberty in
the garden, possibly 1927 or 1928, but the original pair which success-
fully reared young in 1925 were given an aviary to themselves with a
hole cut in the wire and were never shut up winter or summer.
Admittedly, they knew where the food was and came regularly for
meal-worms, and in the winter roosted indoors. When young were
reared in the trees in the garden they were perfectly easy to catch up.

I feared to let them stay too long with the parents, as I thought they
might be driven away. They lived happily for about four years in this
condition and then one morning in February the hen was found dead
in the aviary and the cock was never seen again.
This first pair were so anxious to breed that they started as early
as the end of February one year, with the result that the hen very
nearly died of egg binding, but with great care she pulled through and
was breeding a month later.
The late Mr. Phillips mentioned that a number were released in
Kent, but apart from two or three who were inevitably shot, nothing
further was heard of them. Lack of food during the winter would,
at any rate in Kent, provide great difficulty for the Black-headed
Sibia and possibly it is a good thing that they do not succeed in
establishing themselves in this country, for they are particularly fond
of fruit of all kinds.
The Grey Sibia (Sibia simillima), the first cousin of the Black-headed,
is similar in habits but has no erectile crest. I believe I was the first
to keep any of these birds in aviaries. It is not so confiding as the
Black-headed. Out of seven which were in the aviaries, a pair was
separated and bred in a big garden aviary. We thought to try the
same experiment as had been done with the Black-headed after the
young were hatched, but this time the experiment was a complete
failure because the cock, having found his way out of the aviary
disappeared completely.
This bird inhabits Sumatra, is about the size of a Shama, with an
equally long grey-and-white tail. The eye is red.
We tried to breed Superb Spreo in a similar manner but though
they readily found their way back to the aviary, once at liberty they
neglected the young.
Of the other birds at semi-liberty I would mention the White-
cheeked Bulbul, the Persian species, which had been hand-reared,
but used regularly to escape from his cage in the sitting-room and
would spend two or three hours in the garden chasing other birds
before bothering to return to his cage, which he always did. The
Bulbul died after 15 years with us of old age.
I do not think any article on birds at semi-liberty should pass without
reference to the Trumpeters. I have had many pairs of these birds
and they make really delightful companions. Apart from the fact that
they have to be shut up at night, they are hardy and easy to feed.
One pair we had admittedly strayed a bit, having to be rescued by
the gardener from the Finchley Road.

By Dr. Maurice Amsler
The above title to these notes has a double meaning in that I do not
think any of my pleasant memories of semi-captive birds will ever be
repeated. Much that is written has already appeared in these pages,
but I have never flattered myself by thinking that my avicultural
meanderings were sufficiently interesting to sink very deep into my
readers' memories, so it is to be hoped that a good deal will be news to
at least a few. My earliest recollections go back to 1880, am I therefore
a pioneer among living aviculturists ? I was born and lived the first
four years of my life in Beirut, where perhaps the favourite bird among
the Arabs was the Goldfinch. I had one or two of these and also a
Canary, but as these were kept in small cages and not let out they do
not enter into the subject under discussion. Not so, however, two other
pets, both extremely tame and seldom in their cages, one was a Syrian
Bulbul and the other a Turtle Dove. Most of their lives were spent in
our garden, the poor Dove fell a prey to a wandering cat, but the Bulbul
was with us for nearly a year. He was absolutely tame, in fact almost
aggressive, and I think that the interest he took in my eyes was the
cause of his disappearance, anyhow I always suspected my parents
of having plotted for this end.
To those who will think that I have a striking memory for a child
who was only three, I would recount the fact that I clearly remember
my nurse who was carrying me being butted and sent sprawling by one
of my father's gazelles, and I am told that this woman left us when I was
two years old.
Our next step was to Alexandria, here our house had no garden but
a big flat roof surrounded by a balustrade. This was a paradise for me,
for although it was primarily intended for the drying of laundry I tried
to convert it into a Whipsnade, or perhaps, a farmyard. At various times
I had fowls, Geese, Turkeys, and even a young ram. Most of them were
rescued by me from under the kitchen table, where the cook had
deposited them on his return from market. My greatest joy, however,
was the arrival of a large cage containing a great number of Quails,
of which I was allowed to take a few. Someone cut a wing in each of
these birds, or otherwise pinioned them, and after a few days in a small
run they were so tame that I was able to give them the run of the whole
roof. I do not think they " stayed " very long, probably finding their
way to the top of the parapet, whence they flopped their way down to
earth. My greatest disappointment was that I could not induce the
Geese to swim. Although I repeatedly put them into a huge wash-tub
they struggled and squawked and drenched me with water but would
not " stay put

After that we came to London where as a schoolboy I kept a number
of birds, all hand-reared and all given much liberty in our back garden.
Some of these had a wing cut in their early days, but finally learned to
fly and also finally disappeared. There was a Thrush and a Starling,
both of which would, for a time, come back when whistled. Then there
was Jack, the Jackdaw, a perfectly delightful bird who uttered his name
quite distinctly ; this bird, like most of his kind, was a great character
and also a thief.
One day, to my great sorrow, call as I would I could not find him,
but after a short interval a very curt note arrived from the old spinster
next door saying that Jack had flown in at her bathroom window and
would we remove him ? I was, of course, delighted to recover my pet,
but was met with very black looks ! History does not relate whether
the old lady's sense of modesty was shocked by being visited by this
gentleman while she was having a bath !
Jack was one of three which I took from the nest while staying with a
friend at Rickmansworth. On the same day I descended the hollow
trunk of a pollarded elm and took two young Barn Owls, but when I
came to climb up again I found it quite impossible; had I not had a
companion, who fetched a rope for me, my bones would still be moulder-
ing inside that elm.
The young Owls and Jackdaws were put in a loft and fed appro-
priately, but apparently the Owls preferred Jackdaw to rabbits and
mice, for one morning we found Jack sitting on a perch rather high
up and no signs of his brothers except a few feathers.
That day I returned to town with my pet, and my friend successfully
reared the two Owls, which were finally liberated, though I was told
that they did not immediately make off, but stayed around the house
and showed signs of tameness for some time afterwards. During my
student days all my spare time was taken by a kennel of bull-terriers,
and it was not until I settled in Eton that I went back to birds.. My
first experiment was the arrival of three young Ravens, which had
travelled all the way from the Isle of Lewis in the Hebrides--and I well
remember that the carman who delivered them dumped the box at
my door and rushed off at once ; later he told me that he had been
driven to distraction by the awful din which these three hungry
youngsters were able to raise. They were easily reared and were very
tame, but also frightfully destructive and the worst gardeners of any
livestock I have ever kept. Moreover, they were not without danger
to my dogs, whose eyes caused these birds a great temptation. Two
were given away, one to an Eton master, who kept him in a small
aviary.
This bird proved so noisy that some boys in a neighbouring house
decided to murder him ; one adventurous spirit was chosen for the
fell deed, climbed along the coping of the wall against which the aviary

abutted, and delivered his poison. The bird never turned a feather,
and later when I met the boy I asked him what drug he had used.
His answer was : " Please, Sir, I had no poison of my own so I stole four
cascaras from my Dame's cupboard, they were sugar-coated and the
bird swallowed them at once, but they did not even have the effect
which they would have had on me." My own Raven lived for several
years in my back garden, usually full-winged. Occasionally I tipped
the feathers of one wing ; this was usually after I had some complaint
from a neighbour. I was very unpopular in those days, for my dogs
killed cats and my Raven destroyed gardens. None the less I had great
fun with this bird, who would sit at the open window of my dining-
room waiting for scraps--he knew he was not allowed to come inside
and he very seldom broke that rule. His chief fault was that he did not
realize the strength of his bill or his claws, both of which left many a
mark on my hands.
His end was short and quick, for one morning I found him drowned
in a rainwater tank.
My next step was to buy a large Crystal Palace birdcage in which
I kept as many species of hard-bills as I could procure. These included
Goldfinches, Twites, Linnets, Yellowhammers, Buntings, etc., and,
of course, I soon found that these birds would not agree in such a
confined space, so I built a narrow aviary some thirty feet long in my
small back garden. Here things went quite well and I added more
British birds. In those days you could buy a Linnet for sixpence and
a Bullfinch for a shilling.
Before long, however, I was called in by a new patient, the late
Mr. W. R. Temple, who was a member of the Avicultural Society,
and I was immediately bitten by the disease from which we all suffer.
" I must go in for foreign birds." There and then I decided to liberate
my Britishers, but this was more easily said than done. I opened the
entrance door of my aviary, I opened the feeding doors, I placed the
food outside, also the water. The birds soon began to come out, but
they also went back, and on the evening of the first day there was only
one bird missing. For fear of cats I closed the doors that night, and on
the following day the same thing happened again though I tried to
" shoo " away my birds---here, indeed, was an example of semi-
liberty and an object lesson for the so-called humanitarians who picture
our birds beating themselves against the cage wires. I have had the
same experience with a bird which by accident escaped from a cage
and was back again the same evening. On another occasion, when I
had moved to a better site, I had several aviaries. One of these was
left open and a very mixed collection, including Doves, Thrushes, and
Finches, escaped. There were sixteen all told, fifteen returned the same
day to roost and the truant came back next morning and, being hungry,
was easily trapped.

To return to my Britishers, I was finally forced to catch them up
and take them for a short drive to Burnham Beeches, where they were
turned loose with good wishes and blessings. Were it not for rats and
cats I feel sure that most of these birds, but more especially the Gold-
finches and Bullfinches, would have lived on safely with a little training,
such as observing the Sabbath once a week with all doors shut.
When I moved to a new house I had a reasonable garden backing
on to many acres of meadow land which ran down to the Thames.
Here I had a much better opportunity to keep birds in semi-captivity,
and considering that my house was within thirty yards of the busy
High Street of Eton my losses were extraordinarily few. Indeed, only
one of my failures was due to human agency; this case might be cited
straight away.
Sir Godfrey Davis, on one of his returns from India, gave me a
number of Red Avadavats. After housing them in an aviary for some
weeks, I caught up three pairs and placed them in a large cage with
a wire partition, the cocks being separated from the hens. The cage
was hung in the garden and carefully covered at night. After a day or
two the cocks were liberated. They only flew a few yards and were
soon home again for a feed, so it was easy to catch them up by pulling
to the door by means of a string.
Next day the same process took place with the hens until, finally,
all three pairs were liberated together. They stayed quite well for
several days, but their home visits became fewer and, finally, I thought
all had gone off for good--though I did hear descriptions of " foreign
birds " seen in various gardens near by. What was my joy weeks later
to see a nice little hen Avadavat, accompanied by several young,
feeding on waste seed which had fallen on one of the garden paths.
After this food was daily scattered at that spot and my charming little
family paid me two visits a day, one about io a.m. and the other in
the evening.
I saw nothing of the cock and presumed he had lost his spouse or
possibly been killed.
One sad day I missed the little hen and her young and found it
difficult to understand their sudden disappearance, but later I learned
that a working man in whose little garden these birds had nested, had
caught the cock while the hen was sitting, and that finally, using the
cock as a decoy, he had also caught the hen ; after which the young, who
had no one to guide them, doubtless strayed and dispersed. I was very
sore about this as everyone in the town knew me and my hobby, and
this particular man had often been given an odd bird which I did not
require. Although this species was then quite common, this was one
of my most pleasant avicultural experiences, and knowing the approxi-
mate hour of the Avadavat family's visit I was often able to show my
friends an unusual and very charming sight.

Other Waxbills which I have tried were Gordon Bleus, Blue-breasted
Waxbills, and Green Avadavats. All went off fairly soon, but the Green
Avadavats did raise my hopes by starting a nest in my garden. Any-
how, these birds are not free breeders at any time. Zebra Finches, I felt
sure, would be a success. I surrounded them with nest-boxes, which
they examined assiduously when liberated, but all disappeared in a
very few days. One or two were caught and returned to me later.
My conclusions are that very few seed-eaters will stay when liberated,
that it is an expensive experiment, and that fundamentally it is unkind
to the birds themselves, in that they will all almost certainly starve
with the advent of winter. An exception might be made in the case of
Bullfinches. For many years I was never without two or three pairs
of those handsome Siberian Bullfinches (not the German or Russian
sub-species). Try as I would, I could never breed these birds. I have
had young in the nest scores of times and on one occasion a chick left
the nest only to die from inattention from his parents. Eggs put under
Canaries were always hatched out, but even the long-suffering Canary
is soon frightened away by the young Bullfinches' enormous maw and
beak. Finally I put a pair of these Siberians in a partitioned cage and
soon liberated the cock. The marital devotion of this species is
proverbial (even if it is exaggerated), and very soon the cock was back
at the cage feeding his hen through the wires. A great feature of these
birds is that they are continually calling to each other, so they are not
likely to become parted, and by the same token their owner can usually
locate them. All looked rosy, the hen was liberated to join the cock
and within a very few days was sitting in a juniper within a few feet
of the aviaries. No food was ever provided outside the cage, but their
seed pan was always full of sunflower seed, with which the cock kept
the hen well supplied. During her twelve days of incubation I never
once saw her off the nest. Later I knew they had young, and then the
Duke of Bedford's X appeared on the scene--the nest was empty
and both birds sitting about and looking quite disconsolate. A rat,
I suspected. After a few days my two birds began to make themselves
scarce; the hen rarely showed up, though the cock came for his seed
ration once or twice a day.
The Bullfinches' white rump feathers make it easy to follow their
flight, and with glasses I was able to decide that they always flew to
a garden about two hundred yards to the north of mine. This happened
to belong to an Eton master, who was something of a naturalist, and
at my request he kept his eyes open and finally told me that my birds
had a nest at the very top of a tall pear tree. The situation was almost
inaccessible for me and, anyhow, I did not wish to disturb the sitting
hen, but when three weeks had passed and we saw nothing of the birds,
I took a risk of broken bones and clambered up with much difficulty,
only to find a nest with three or four cold eggs, each with a neat round

puncture. Was this X, or possibly a Starling ? After this I saw less
and less of my two old birds, and as I had a couple more pairs in the
aviaries I allowed them to have their liberty hoping they might establish
a nucleus of Siberian Bullfinches in the neighbourhood. If they did
so I was never able to discover it.
It was not until 1912, when new aviaries were built, that I was
able to make any serious experiments with birds at liberty, and
then proved, as is already well known, that the presence of young
in the nest is the most powerful incentive for luring liberated birds
back to their own aviary. They also taught one that small aviaries,
each containing only one pair of birds, were essential if the
birds were not to be given complete liberty, with just a cage to act
as a snack bar and also a trap. Insectivorous birds and also the
many species which feed their young largely on insects though
they are in fact seed eaters always turn out to be the best subjects for
semi-liberty. A supply of mealworms and other delicacies, such as
fresh ants 5 eggs and cockroaches, will always produce the urge to
return to their aviaries with food for their young, whereas any amount
of seed in the case of true and purely vegetarian hard-bills, such as
Goldfinches or Linnets, will not have this effect, or at any rate to a
much less degree.
In this connection it is worth while stating that one can easily spoil
liberty birds by being too lavish with the supply of mealworms or
other insects. The birds very soon learn that it is not necessary for
them to hunt the coverts, and just sit about waiting for their owner's
next arrival, thus depriving their young of much natural and fresh
insect food, which must surely be more wholesome than the staple
mealworm.
Perhaps the most exciting and also terrifying moment is when the
old birds emerge from their aviary for the first time, any loud noise or
other cause of fright may cause them to dash straight off for good.
I always tried to contrive that the cock should come out alone when
the hen was brooding her young or busy inside her nest-box. A tin of
mealworms placed on the sill of the open feeding door is a good first
lesson, the bird helps himself and goes back to the nest, taking no
advantage of the open door. Next the tin can be fixed to a post a few
feet outside the door. If the bird goes straight back you pat yourself
on the back, but more often he flies on to the aviary roof and tries to
get back through the wires; finally he loses patience and swallows his
mealworms. Meanwhile, you have crept up and replaced the tin in
number one position ; this he soon discovers and once more returns to
the aviary. Having had his first lesson he can be shut in for a hour or
two, after which he should be tried again ; next time the insects can
be scattered on the ground.
It must be remembered that a bird's view of the surrounding country

is very limited by the walls forming their aviary and that much which
they see on coming out is absolutely and completely new to them,
none the less, once they have learned their way around they never forget
it, and the following year both birds can be liberated without the
slightest risk of their losing their way. A sound precautionary plan is
to close the feeding door at night. My own plan was to put in a good
supply of mealworms for the morrow's breakfast after dark when I
closed the door, which my man used to open as soon as he had made
sure that all was well and the young were being fed. An example of
what may happen if you neglect this precaution will be related when
treating of Blue Robins.
One of my earlier serious experiments with birds which had young
already hatched in their aviary concerns a pair of Green Cardinals.
These had, in the past, reared several broods of young, but as the diet
consisted almost entirely of insects I decided to see whether they would
not collect their own provender if given freedom. The experiment was
completely successful, very few insects were provided by me. A very
large amount of aphis or greenfly was used and the young were the
finest I had ever reared. It is, of course, possible that the old birds
collected buds or other greenstuff to which they had not access when
confined to their aviary.
I had, for a long time, wished to breed one of the Parid&amp;lt;e as no one
else appeared to have succeeded in this direction. My efforts with
various exotic species, both Indian and American, had failed because
the birds did not live long. The same applied to the Crested Tit
(P. cristatus), although this is a North British bird, mine came from
Holland. Finally I caught a pair of Great Tits (P. major). Much
to my surprise they proved the wildest aviary birds I had ever possessed
and were soon half-scalped and half-naked from their attempts to get
out. I was, in fact, on the point of letting them go when I found that
the hen was carrying some rabbits' fur which I had provided. She had
a Berlepsch nest log in which she soon deposited six eggs, all of which
hatched. The young were all reared and when independent were
liberated. During the rearing period the male became fairly tame, but
the hen, although no longer wild, was quite shy.
They soon went to nest again, four eggs being laid, and as soon as
these hatched I opened wide the main and feeding doors of the aviary.
To my surprise the cock immediately came to me for food, and within
a day or two was taking mealworms from my hand. Very shortly he
would follow me into the house and had often to be ' 4 shown the door ".
Finally he discovered when we had our meals and used to visit our
table and take what he wanted. On one occasion, when several people
had come to tea, he paid us a number of visits. Bread and butter, also
currant cake (which were articles of diet in those days), were his
favourites on our menu. As soon as the young flew the whole family

departed and it was with something of a pang that I realized that I had
seen the last of my little friend, but it was a consolation to know that
he must have forgiven me the fright which I gave him and his wife
when I first caught and imprisoned them.
Other species which I have tried at liberty when breeding, with
various success, are Shamas, Black-headed Sibias, Orchard Finches,
and, of course, Blue Robins. Shamas, with their almost unvarying
tameness, would appear to be ideal birds for liberty breeding, but
some accident has always frustrated my efforts. For some reason, it is
a little difficult to get the cocks to go home at night, and a downpour
during the dark hours seems to leave them so drenched that they are
quite helpless and liable to be lost and starved, if, indeed, they do not
fall a prey to some form of vermin.
Sibias have been very satisfactory liberty birds with at least one
breeder, but I have always failed. The Orchard Finch (Phrygilus
fruticeti) a large and rather handsome American Bunting, earned me a
medal in 1915, and during the following year I allowed them their
liberty with their second nest, which they reared with very little help
from me. One does not expect much personality in a Bunting, but my
male Orchard Finch was certainly an exceptional bird, gifted with
marvellous sight and quick intelligence.
In those days I used to return to lunch on foot after my round in
Eton College. Being pleasanter walking I usually came by the South
Meadow, on to which my garden abutted. It was almost impossible
for me to get home without being spotted by the cock Orchard Finch,
who often met me as far as sixty or eighty yards from my garden gate.
He knew I carried a small tin of mealworms and, having gathered a
few of these, he would fly like a flash back to his young. As far as I
know, he never approached any strangers, though I think he may have
enjoyed human company for I saw him on several occasions sitting
and singing on a telephone wire high above the crowded High Street
of Eton.
Had I not received my orders from our Editor I should hardly dare
to repeat the tale of my experiences with the American Blue Bird, or
Blue Robin.
In the old days these birds could be purchased at a price varying from
km. to 151. a pair, but the American Government very rightly put a
stop to their exportation, whereupon it was quite impossible, except
for the chosen few, to obtain a pair of Blue Birds. A limited number
was occasionally sent to such places as our Zoological Society, and it
was a matter of great joy and surprise to me to be presented with a
perfect pair in the autumn of 1926.
Not knowing how hardy these birds really were, I wintered them
in a heated aviary and turned them out in the following March.
They were given two good nest logs in the shelter of their&apos; aviary,

which they shared with a few odd Finches and also Canaries, for I was
at that time breeding quite a number of mules between the Hooded
Siskin and the Common Canary. Nothing happened for several weeks,
and as I was getting impatient I hung another nest-box in the outside
flight and had scarcely stepped back from so doing when both birds
disappeared down the entrance box, and within a few hours a nest was
almost completed. Four or five eggs followed, all of which hatched,
and as was my subsequent experience, the young began to die off one
or more daily from the age of four days onwards. After this I had the
unusual sight of the male Blue Bird feeding any young Canary which he
could find, and these youngsters appeared to be none the worse for
what was a purely protein diet.
Another clutch was laid within a few days with much the same
results, so I moved the pair to a small aviary which they had to them-
selves. The third nest was more successful, four young leaving their
box at the age of seventeen days, but again they all died off, this time,
I feel certain, from neglect. Had I known what I subsequently learned,
I should have put the whole family in a large cage with a constant
supply of live food, but without a nesting-box to distract the parents'
attention. Finally there was a fourth and last nest, from which one
chick, a male, was fully reared. Only one bird out of some sixteen
hatched that year ! Thanks to the kindness of the Duke of Wellington
I was able to procure another hen, which had been much prized by
the late Duchess. I thus began the next season with two adult pairs,
and this time I made no mistakes, for I reared over sixty Blue Birds
in the two following years. It will be seen that this success was achieved
by means which were foul rather than fair. Knowing what good layers
we had in this species I decided to try the common Redbreast as a
foster parent. Actually I found that if a Blue Bird's eggs were removed
the hen would lay again in exactly ten days and that it was thus possible
to obtain five clutches in the year, say twenty to twenty-five eggs.
The trouble was now to find Redbreasts' nests containing eggs, if
possible in a safe position.
All my friends helped me valiantly and during these years many a
telephone message, instead of being a call from a patient, was the
welcome news that a nest of eggs had been found, or that a Robin
was building. A somewhat surprising discovery was that there was no
necessity for the age of the two sets of eggs to synchronize. I have put
freshly laid Blue Birds' eggs into a Robin's nest whose eggs were actually
chipping, and I have also introduced Blue Bird's eggs which were on
the point of hatching under a Robin who had scarcely begun to sit.
These strange happenings appeared to have no effect on the Red-
breast's peace of mind, and barring accidents they always did their
parental duties quite perfectly. I found it a good plan, when possible,
to accustom the fosters to a trap cage, so one of these was usually

hung near the nest and a few crumbs of mealworms were occasionally
dropped into it.
Young Blue Birds usually leave the nest on the sixteenth or seven-
teenth day, but it is safer to take them at a fortnight. If the parents
have been trained to a trap they can usually be caught in a few minutes,
if it is set and baited with mealworms. The young are then collected
and the whole family taken home and transferred to a large cage with
an unlimited amount of live bait. In a week or ten days the young will
be helping themselves to insects and soft food and the time will have
come to return the foster parents to their home locality. From a point
of view of interest I always put rings on these birds before liberating
them and I have thus proved that I have made use of the same birds
more than once, on one occasion it was twice in one season.
Towards the end of the breeding season it becomes very difficult
to find Robins nesting and it was this which prompted me, in fear and
trembling, to give my Blue Birds their liberty. My method with them
were those which I have already outlined, and the birds proved very
amenable and very good stayers, in fact I only lost one pair, and
that was due to carelessness after several years of liberty-breeding.
I have already mentioned the importance of making certain that
all was well before liberating the birds in the morning. One day I
noticed that the cock looked rather apathetic as he sat on the aviary
roof and I could see no sign of his mate. Mealworms did not interest
him. On looking into the nest-box, where I expected to find a dead
hen, I discovered five little corpses instead. Later on I got a glimpse
of the hen, but try as I would I could not induce either bird to return
to their aviary, and before night they had disappeared. Advertise-
ments and rewards posted in various shops brought in no news of my
truants, until a man informed me that he had caught the cock and
wanted #5 for it. On inspecting the bird I found it to be a hen Cordon
Bleu ! Some weeks later another man, whose cottage was close to the
Eton College Sanatorium, described what were obviously my Blue
Birds, both had been feeding on his allotment and what clinched the
matter was that they were accompanied by three or four birds which
were " speckled like tiny thrushes ". My birds had bred in complete
freedom.
I set a trap in that allotment with another cock as a decoy, but never
saw a sign of my escapes. The following spring a nurse at the
Sanatorium rushed into the matron's room in great excitement and
described what was obviously a male Blue Bird, so one at least had not
migrated and had withstood a fairly severe winter.
I always made it a rule not to leave the young in the aviary when
there was any chance of their leaving the nest. Their box was usually
transferred to a cage about the fourteenth day and the parents were
caught up and caged much as I did with the foster parents. As soon as

the young had all left the nest-box it was removed, and by this means
I think I was able to completely eliminate any chance of parental
neglect.
One of my liberty pairs which was extremely steady and reliable
at one time took great interest in a log box which hung against a fence
in the garden. The cock in particular was constantly visiting it during
his off-moments when not engaged in feeding young. On inspecting
the box I was surprised to find it contained a nest, and a few days later
there was one Blue Bird's egg in the nest. I was in something of a
quandary as the young in the aviary were nearing the time when they
might fly. As soon as the pair had finished off their young in the usual
cage I put them back into the aviary and managed to liberate the hen
without the cock. She immediately went to that outdoor nest-box
and was obviously distressed that her mate was not there to do the
usual honours. I therefore took a risk and let both birds out, this
meant that I could not shut them in at night, but every scrap of food
and every insect was given inside the aviary so that I had a fairly good
hold on them and could catch them up at any time. Eggs were laid,
and five of the finest young I have ever bred were reared. I first caught
both parents by enticing them into their aviary, and having placed the
box of young in their cage I then added the two old birds. It was
actually this nest which brought my record number to just over sixty.
It all sounds very easy, but one had one's disappointments. For
instance, two families of young birds, when independent, began to
die off at an alarming rate, it was suggested to me that they were
getting too many mealworms. These were immediately reduced to
half a dozen per bird once daily and the deaths ceased.
All the preceding notes refer to the Eastern Blue Bird, but after I
left Eton and came to Kent, where I had a large garden with open
country all round, I received a cock and two hens of the even more
beautiful Western sub-species from our President and Mons. Delacour.
I bred a few of these and also more of the Easterns and even a hybrid,
or cross, between the two, but contrary to my expectations my results
were not nearly so successful as when I lived on the outskirts of a town
and had much less time to give my birds. The explanation is, I feel sure,
that there is a much larger population of verminous birds and animals
in rural district than in towns. Rats and mice are always with us,
but here we have also stoats, weasels, two or three kinds of Owl (.Athene
noctua is very common), Hawks, Magpies, and Jays, and a large popula-
tion of field mice, voles, and shrews. Moles, although harmless in
themselves, often burrow down and into the aviaries, making an easy
entrance for weasels and possibly also for rats.
One more anecdote showing the cussedness of birds shall end these
very voluminous notes. A pair of Western Blue Birds hatched out
several young in a small aviary. As they were my only pair I could

not take the risk of letting them out, and as has so often happened I
had the chagrin of seeing the young gradually becoming less and less.
Finally, I had only two left and these looked none too strong. In
desperation I had a frantic search for a Robin's nest with young, but
all I could find was a nest-box containing two odd little brown birds
a good deal further advanced than my Blue Birds. I took them out
wondering what they were and substituted my own youngsters.
Incidentally they were never fed and were both dead within a few
hours. Not wishing to destroy the two " brownies " I slipped them into
the Blue Birds' nest-box, where I thought they would at least not die
of cold. I ceased to supply mealworms for I felt sure that they would
only be wasted, but the Blue Birds continued to feed with their usual
mixture and within a few days both little strangers were on the aviary
floor. As I had seen this sort of thing before, I put them and their
adopted parents in a cage until I saw the young picking up food.
When I liberated them they flew straight up on to an adjoining pergola
and immediately began to shoot up into the air, hawking small insects,
invisible to me--it was not until then that I recognized them to be
Spotted Flycatchers ! Gan anyone explain why these two birds failed
to rear their own young on a mixed but suitable diet but succeeded
perfectly with two adopted young, the food being only a rather poor

The late Mr. T. Hebb generously bequeathed his avicultural books to the Society.
As the Society, however, already possesses copies of them, the Executive Committee
has decided that they shall be offered for sale to members of the Society and the sum
raised devoted to the purchase of other books for the Society's library.
The undermentioned books are for disposal and offers should be addressed to me
at Chelmsford Road, Southgate, N. 14. Special attention is drawn to the copy of
Reichenow's Papageien ; this is an exceptional opportunity of acquiring one of the

Members of the Avicultural Society, 30 ; Guests, 2. Total 32.
The Chairman in his opening address said that everyone present knew well that
the Avicultural Society had been established over fifty years, during which time it had
ever been to the forefront in matters avicultural, and enjoyed the distinction of being
undoubtedly the premier avicultural society in the world. During this long period,
however, comparatively few opportunities had been afforded members to meet
socially. This was an omission some members, notably Mr. Prestwich, Miss Knobel,.
and Miss Barclay-Smith, felt should be rectified. They considered this could best be
done by the formation of the B.A.C., confined to members of the Avicultural Society.
The Chairman then mentioned the British Ornithologists' Union, founded in 1858,
which had a British Ornithologists' Club formed in 1892. This had proved a great
success and consisted of the " cream " of the B.O.U. The B.A.C., if formed, would be
analogous to the B.O.G.
The intention was to hold regular meetings, either before or following a dinner,
possibly monthly with the exception of the three or four summer months. These
meetings would give members an opportunity of getting to know one another and
allow inter-change of views, etc. It was suggested that each meeting be specialized--
Parrots, Pheasants, Waterfowl, etc., and that in addition to speakers there should be
exhibits.
The Chairman then read a letter from the President of the Avicultural Society,
Mr. A. Ezra, to the acting Hon. Secretary.
" I think your idea of a British Aviculturists' Club an excellent one. It seems the
very best way to enable members of the Society to meet and get to know one another,
which will be a grand thing for the Society. I hope you will be able to get enough
members to promise to attend and will be successful in forming the club, which I
shall certainly hope to be able to attend from time to time."
The Chairman then said that before proceeding further he would ask the members
of the Avicultural Society present to signify by a show of hands whether they were in
favour of a club based on these lines. The showing was unanimously in favour.
The first matter then to be settled was the formation of a Committee. In his
experience large committees were undesirable, as they rarely got things done, and he
suggested that this be limited to five or six members. Miss Barclay-Smith, Miss
Knobel, Mr. Prestwich, and himself had acted as a provisional committee and were
all willing to serve. Mr. Prestwich had acted as Hon. Secretary and was prepared to
continue as Hon. Secretary and Treasurer. Dr. Amsler and Mr. Sydney Porter were
suggested as additional members.
The members of the newly-formed B.A.C. then elected these six as the Committee.
The Chairman proceeded to give further details and asked for criticisms and
suggestions.
Place of Meetings .--At present the choice was very limited, suitable accommodation
being almost non-existent. The Rembrandt Hotel had the facilities and had the
advantage of being easily accessible.
Mr. lies asked whether it was proposed always to hold the meetings in London, or
whether they would sometimes be held in provincial towns.
Dr. Amsler said that London had always been regarded as the " home-town " of
the Avicultural Society, the Council Meetings, etc., had always been held there, and
he presumed that the same would apply to the B.A.C. Mr. Vane said there could be

no objection to members resident in the Midlands, or other parts of the country,
organizing meetings or dinners on their own, provided they were affiliated.
The Chairman said that the cost of the dinner would be i o.y. 6 d. each, and possibly
some members would consider this more than they were prepared to pay.
In the discussion that followed Mr. England said he thought too much stress was
being laid on the dinners and not enough on the meetings. If there were eight or nine
during the year it would be quite a heavy item of expenditure for members. Was it
really necessary to have the dinner ?
The Chairman replied that in the main he agreed, but hotels were not interested
in providing facilities for meetings unless they also provided a dinner.
Several members thought the meetings should be two monthly and Mr. Goodwin
suggested quarterly. Mr. Vane, however, thought that quarterly would be too in-
frequent, as if a member missed one he would have a six months gap. Eventually it
was decided that the meetings should be two monthly, with the omission of one or
possibly two during the summer months.
Time of Meetings. --It was decided that in view of the present difficulties of travel
to enable members living at a distance an opportunity of getting home at a reasonable
time the meeting should be at 6 p.m., followed by the dinner at 7 p.m.
Subscription. --The Chairman said the Committee was anxious that this should be
as low as possible, and in view of the fact that there would be no expenses in regard
to a publication, the pages of the Avicultural Magazine being available for the
bulletins and reports, the amount suggested was 55. a year. This was unanimously
agreed.
Visitors. --Would be welcome ; the dining charge would be payable by the members
introducing.
Guests of the Club.-- Persons of note, foreign aviculturists, etc., by invitation of the
Committee, charges payable by the Club.
Mr. Prestwich said that invitations had been sent to all members of the Avicultural
Society resident in England, some 250. Eighty replies had been received--thirty
acceptances, twenty applications for membership, ten interested and twenty " regrets ".
Thus there was a potential membership of sixty.
He proposed that Mr. Seth-Smith should be the permanent Chairman, Miss
Barclay-Smith the deputy-chairman, and Miss Knobel the Club's hostess. These were
all agreed with acclamation. He further proposed that Mr. Ezra should be elected
the first honorary member of the Club. The members present, while agreeing with
this suggestion, were of the opinion that whereas there would probably be a number
of these it was desirable that a unique distinction be bestowed on Mr. Ezra, and after
various suggestions it was finally unanimously decided that Mr. Ezra should be asked
to be Patron of the Club.
The meeting finally dispersed at 10 p.m.
A. A. P.
Dr. Maurice Amsler moved a most warm vote of thanks to Mr. A. A. Prestwich for
his great generosity in entertaining the members present to the excellent dinner they
had all enjoyed, thereby giving the British Aviculturists' Club a start under the most
auspicious circumstances. This was passed with acclamation. To Mr. Prestwich
must be accorded the credit for the formation of the Club for it is entirely due to his
foresight and energy that it has come into being.
Ed.
The first meeting of the British Aviculturists' Club will be held at the Rembrandt
Hotel on Wednesday, 10th April, 1946, at 6 p.m.

Death of Mr. John Frostick
All members of the Avicultural Society will learn with the greatest regret of the
death of Mr. John Frostick, the sole remaining Original Member. Mr. Frostick died
on 8th March, sitting in his armchair, without any illness or pain ; he was in his
81 st year. Mr. Frostick was known personally to a large number of members of the
Avicultural Society and his charm of manner and great knowledge will be sorely

missed. He acted as Judge at the last Crystal Palace Bird Show in January this year,
and from his great activity, keen brain, and interest in affairs generally, it was almost
impossible to believe that he had reached his eightieth year. With the passing of
Mr. Frostick an important and generally beloved link with the early days of aviculture
has been lost. An Obituary notice will appear in the next number of the Magazine.

THE INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR
BIRD PRESERVATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998710225806452" page_id="56288859"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
It is some years now since I, as one of the oldest members of
the Avicultural Society, appealed to my fellow members to give
their support to the British Section of the International Committee for
Bird Preservation, of which I have been a member since its formation.
This Committee has managed to carry on through the six years of war,
but now that peace has come and war restrictions have been removed, it
needs, more than ever, all the support it can get in order to go ahead with
all the work that should be done; hence, I am asking you to listen to me
again.
We of the Avicultural Society are first and foremost lovers of birds, and
wish for their preservation in all parts of the world, particularly those species
that are rare and in special need of protection.
I think we have always been rather suspicious of certain societies which
obtain their support from a section of the public who are sentimentalists
rather than true naturalists, and who have the very mistaken idea that a
bird in captivity is necessarily unhappy. Certain societies have grown rich
from the gifts of these dear mistaken people, but the International Com-
mittee takes a wider and more intelligent view of bird preservation, a view
that is, I feel sure, shared by aviculturists.
The International Committee for Bird Preservation consists of people
who are genuine bird-lovers, but the great majority (all those that I have
met) are not opposed to either sport or aviculture. The President of the
whole Committee is Monsieur Jean Dalacour, who we all know as a leading
ornithologist and aviculturist, while many other aviculturists--Mr. Alfred
Ezra for one--are either Patrons or Associates on the British Section, of
which our Editor is the Secretary.
Owing to the efforts of the British Section, a Bill was drafted and passed
into law prohibiting the importation into Great Britain of live Quail during
the breeding season. Many of us can remember the dark crowded boxes
of these birds which were to be seen in poulterers* shops, where they fattened
for the table. Now there are indications that, as a result of the Bill, the
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.996871913043479" page_id="56288860"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
Quail is increasing as a breeding bird in our land. Another Act of Parlia-
ment passed shortly before the War (Wild Birds (Ducks and Geese)
Protection Act, 1939) was framed in order to prevent the wholesale slaughter
of these birds and their importation (as food) to this country during the
breeding season.
Another matter with which the Committee is concerned, but has had
to be shelved during the War, is the better treatment of live birds during
transit from Africa and the East to Europe. The Committee would like
to see consignments to dealers inspected before dispatch, to ensure that
cages are suitable and not overcrowded. It is a matter that was often
commented upon before the War and, if not taken in hand by a reasonable
body like the International Committee, is likely to lead to stringent laws
that might affect aviculture adversely.
I have long felt that in the interests of aviculture, if for no other reason,
the Avicultural Society should whole-heartedly support the British Section
of the International Committee, and I should like to see the great majority
of our members either Patrons or Associates.
Patrons of the Section are invited at an annual subscription of three
guineas, and Associates at an annual subscription of ioj. 6 d. Both Patrons
and Associates will be kept in touch with the activities of the British Section,
and receive the Annual Report and other publications as issued.
Those who are willing to assist in this good work are asked to send
their subscriptions to the Secretary, British Section, I.C.B.P., c/o The

By Karl Plath, Curator of Birds, Chicago Zoological Park,
Brookfield, Ill.
Each year in my annual inventory of the feathered inmates of our
Zoo a certain satisfaction is derived when I see the hardy survivors
of the collection which was on view during the first year of the Zoo's
existence, 1934-5.
Starting in order, " Bella," the female South African Ostrich, still
is hale and hearty. She has a large yard with sand, stones, grass, and
hawthorn trees, and even enjoys being outdoors when the temperature
is as low as 35 degrees. Her mate died suddenly in 1944 and post
mortem revealed that the stomach was hard packed with unshelled
peanuts ! We hope to get another male or possibly a new pair of
younger birds.
Bennett's Cassowary comes next. Like most of her tribe she is
untrustworthy and even vicious at times. We have had two other
species in the past and never could keep any together, though for
a short time an Australian Cassowary leaped the fence and stayed
quietly enough with the Bennett's for a day or so until we could get
him out. He lived in the Zoo 7 years and 5 months. The third species
was a fine One-wattled Cassowary whose showy neck- and plaque-
colouring was very conspicuous. He passed on to the happy hunting
grounds last year, having lived with us over eleven years. The Bennett's
Cassowary has laid a few eggs in the past. They are of a beautiful
apple green colour and larger than the darker green eggs of the Emu.
Both have the shagreen-like surface. (A seldom used word--
" shagreen "--nowdays !)
Four of our original six Emus received in 1934 still survive. One
male and three females. The male shows some signs of friendliness,
and if one has the patience to wait along enough will condescend

to have his neck rubbed. At times we have to catch them up and
they are very difficult to corral and capture. They loose all sense of
" reason " and dash and jump about with dangerous abandon.
Three of the big African White Pelicans and one handsome black
and white Australian Pelican (named " Banjo-eyes " by the keepers)
seem as active and lively as when we first got them. The White
Pelicans become flushed with a delicate pink early in the year and
both have a showy yellow patch on the breast at this time. The
females have conspicuous crests during the breeding season, but none
have ever laid.
Four of the ten Black-crowned Night Herons received from the
National Zoo in 1934 are still with us in our large indoor flying cage.
Each year they make attempts at nesting, but seem to have trouble
in keeping the branches in place and spend so much time watching
those that do get into nest foundation that egg-laying seems to be
forgotten. Two of the beautiful Nankeen Night Herons also received
in 1934 are still with us. They are of a beautiful shade of light chestnut
and have black crowns. All Night Herons are beautiful, as are all of
the heron tribe, and always keep their plumage sleek and clean.
One Shoebill remains of the four received in 1935. The three who
died may be said to have died from accidental injuries. Only one,
the survivor, ever exhibits traits of friendliness and enjoys playing
with the keeper when he is hosing off the rocks of the huge flying cage.
He is temperamental and needs a lot of coaxing and patience before
he will finally swallow the fish proffered. Like all Shoebills he is
slow and very deliberate in motions and spends a lot of time in deep
meditation, so that people question if he is alive or not. He has the
habit of shaking his head " no " to well-put questions, giving an
impression of intelligence which is a trifle exaggerated. However,
I have heard of other Shoebills in other collections doing the same,
and their caretakers, too, give their birds credit for ability to under-
stand the English language.
Two Woolly-necked Storks are still here since 1935, though we were
given to understand they were extremely delicate. They are handsome
birds, glossy black with the neck covered with woolly-like white
feathers. When they fly, the short black forktail is conspicuous against
the long white under-tail coverts.
The Saddle-billed Stork is, I think, the largest and handsomest of
the Stork family. He is mainly iridescent green, blue, coppery, and
purple with a broad white collar at the back of the neck and white
on the under parts and wing quills. A curious heart-shaped patch of
blood red skin is conspicuous on the chest. The name is derived
from the saddle-shaped patch of yellow skin across the base of the
black-banded scarlet beak. The illusion is further heightened by two
yellow " stirrups " which dangle underneath the bill below the saddle.

He is an active showy bird and in summer inhabits the huge Sudan
scene with antelopes, etc.
A Marabou Stork named " Henry " was received in 1935. He is
attractive because of sheer ugliness--not only in appearance. He
always has his plumage smooth and neat, and when the beautiful
plumes grow under his tail they do compensate for the ugliness at
the other end. " Henry " was tame at first, but is slow to become
friendly with a new keeper, and as soon as the latter's back is turned
he comes after him with a few well-directed punches with his powerful
beak. He summers with the Yaks.
Two beautiful African Flamingos are still here after eleven years.
They become a delicate pink in early autumn and retain this tint
until after they are put outdoors in May. But this is a natural pro-
cedure even in a wild state, for even the brilliant American Red
Flamingo fades out after the breeding season in May. We don't use
any special colour feeding, but approximate their natural food of
crustaceans with powdered shrimps and dried aquatic flies, etc.,
which brings them in colour at the proper season.
Of the great order of Anseriformes we have a gratifying list of
survivors. We have several unrelated Mute Swans and possibly
the large number tends to disturbance and frustration of our hopes
at breeding time. They are vicious and powerful. By secluding our
Black Swans in pens on the lake we usually succeed each year in
raising some. They are acclimatized now to stay outdoors the year
round and usually start laying in March. At first, when we had them
indoors, they would start nest building in January and the eggs would
start to hatch thirty-five days later--too early to put the cygnets
outdoors, and our indoor accommodations were too small, with the
result that all of the young succumbed sooner or later--mainly to
being trampled on by their parents or for lack of suitable swimming
space.
Canada Geese and Mallards breed plentifully and we take them as
a matter of course. A Whooping Swan, the surviving female of a
pair received in 1934, is the tamest Swan I have ever heard of. When
we had the pair they had to be kept secluded because of the viciousness
of the male, who would kill any Swan or Goose who came near them.
A few years ago we found the male dead in the water and the keeper
and I carried him out. The female seemed very distressed and made
plaintive cries even though they were loud and discordant. She
followed us all the way to the fence surrounding the lake. Since
that time, whenever the keeper or I scale the fence, the female, who
since her mate's death has been at large on the lake, comes up to
him or me and when within a few feet rushes up closely, spreads her
wings as if to embrace, and lays her head on his breast--while he
pets and strokes her. All this time she keeps up a running flow of

sounds which seem to express her pleasure. However, if we both
enter at the same time she will go to the one nearest her and then
rush at the other and try to bite. She does this to anyone else also,
but reserves her affection for either one of us if we go in singly. She
has a little companion, a male Barnacle Goose, who follows her
about and sits beside her. She ignores the goose, but seems to have
a powerful attraction for him. The combination of size looks absurd.
Other Geese and Ducks still here after the past decade are Serni-
palmated Geese, Blue Geese, Black-bellied and Black-billed Tree
Ducks, Australian Black Duck, and Rosy-billed Duck.
A Secretary Bird received from Africa in 1935 shares the large
antelope yard with various Sudan Antelopes, Cranes, etc. It is
majestic, and its attenuated appearance gives little impression that
it is really of the bird of prey group. Secretary Birds attain great speed
in running, and it is interesting to see this bird kick and stamp at
its captured food--either a snake or a mouse--before eating it.
The old Brush Turkey has to be solitary most of the time as he
is too vicious and aggressive ; he literally ran his wife ragged so that
she had no plumage at all. He has interesting if untidy habits. In
summer he is put in the 40-ft. run where we keep the Peacocks in
winter. This run has a shed at one end for shelter which usually has
straw on the floor. As soon as he is put in the run he starts scratching
out every particle of straw and scratches it cleanly clear to the opposite
end forming a huge pile. Then he is content, though at times he starts
another pile to keep his powerful legs busy. In a wild state such huge
brush piles form the nesting place and the decaying vegetation with
its attendant heat hatches the eggs. It is said the young on emerging
are able to fend for themselves. The Brush Turkey is mainly black
in colour, but has the bare head and neck coloured a vivid red and
yellow.
A Vulturine Guineafowl came in the African shipment of 1935.
While mostly of the typical guineafowl grey colour, he has black and
white stripes on the neck and the under parts are varied with bright
cobalt blue. An elongated tail imparts elegance to his streamlined
form. He, too, survives because of his fearlessness.
Of cranes two species remain which were here in the opening year
of the Zoo. A fine Australian Crane which is very tame and friendly
and delights in dancing around with spread wings in the characteristic
Crane fashion and one of the showy Crowned Cranes. We find the
Cranes, especially when kept in community groups, very belligerent
and aggressive, and have learned through experience that it is not
safe to keep too many together. The Australian Crane has laid
infertile eggs, but to date the only Cranes we have succeeded in rearing
is one Stanley Crane which came in 1940. This youngster was raised
entirely by the parents.

Three of the five Silver Gulls received in 1933 from the National
Zoological Park are the nucleus of the fine flock we now have. We
usually have at least two in a brood and they have bred nearly every
year in the large indoor flying cage in the Aquatic House. They
are beautiful little Gulls and add to the interest and movement of
this cage.
Speckled Pigeons from Africa breed fairly regularly with us : this
is a handsome species much coveted by Pigeon fanciers. The beautiful
Nicobar Pigeon, whose plumage is glossy iridescent green with a
white tail, has a feather cape of long hackle feathers on the neck.
The prince of all is, of course, the magnificent Crowned Pigeon, who
is the size of a very large fowl. Two other species, the Victoria and
the Sclater's, lived until a short time ago.
Probably the Parrot tribe is best represented by longevity records.
One can only guess at the ages of some of them prior to their arrival
here.
In order they are as follows :--
Eight Sulphur-crested Cockatoo. Have laid in our breeding runs
but no young.
One Leadbeater's Cockatoo.
Three Bare-eyed Cockatoo. One has an amusing habit of dancing
and whirling.
Eight Cockatiel.
One Lear's Macaw. No one knows just what locality in Brazil he
is native of.
One Blue and Yellow Macaw.
Five Red and Yellow Macaws. Have also laid.
One Mexican Conure.
One Blue-fronted Amazon.
One Lesser Vasa Parrot.
One Eclectus Parrot : a beautiful green male. The female is gorgeous
crimson.
Three Crimson-winged Parrakeets. We have raised six from these.
One King Parrot. Our flock from the original group now numbers
twenty.
Two Common Rosella, the original pair. We now have five plus
a hybrid whose father is a Crimson Rosella.
One Barnard's Parrakeet.
Two Bourke's Parrakeet. Now have a flock of six.
One Hooded Parrakeet (an old female but in fine shape).
An old-timer is " Tony " the Tawny Frogmouth. He, too, came
over from Australia in 1934 and in all that time he has never eaten
from a dish--always eats his mouse or meat from our fingers. He
knows some of us and comes to the edge of his cage at our call.
A White-cheeked Coly is the only one left from a flock of twelve.

Their deaths were due to fighting. He is amusing because of his
acrobatic movements, especially when he " chins 55 himself on a branch.
We have one Kookaburra left : sometimes his demoniacal laughing
sounds startle the visitor. Laughing Jackass or Giant Kingfisher
are equally proper names for him. Though a Kingfisher, he prefers
mice or meat.
Another Australian is the Black-backed Piping Grow ; he is quite
musical for such a large bird. A White-eyed Crow also makes plenty
of sounds--though weirdly reminiscent of the moans and groans
associated with a sojourn in the dentist's chair. Add to the Australian
contingent two Satin Bowerbirds and the related Green Catbird,
the musical Grey Butcherbird and the Spiny-cheeked Honeyeater.
This latter bird belongs to a species none too hardy in captivity, b.ut
this fellow has lived well and without any honey ! He won't eat it.
He also has a pleasing voice.
A Rufus-necked Weaverbird completes this list of long livers.
We have hundreds of others received since 1935, and since 1938 we
have had gratifying results in breeding many Parrot-like birds and
others, but most of these experiences have been written up before.

You will probably be interested in the bird life of this island, it is
not plentiful in variety, the only finch I have observed is the common
Nutmeg Manakin which normally reaches the aviaries of the world
from the Malay Archipelago and Java. These finches were nesting in
a coco-nut palm when I first observed them (about August). The nest
was of the usual conical grass type, similar to that constructed by the
Australian Grass Finches. It was tucked away in the butt of a broken-
off palm branch about fifteen feet from the ground. Later I observed
more pairs nesting in similar locations and presume this is the common
nesting place for these birds. One pair I observed produced four
healthy youngsters and though I did not have the opportunity to
verify this by observation of other breeding pairs, I think four could be
taken as the average brood.
Apart from the breeding pairs the birds seem to be gregarious and
fly about in small flocks of eight to twelve. They feed on seeding grasses

which I could not name but which are similar to the wild seeding
grasses of Northern Australia. I imagine they would also eat some of
the smaller types of wild berries.
I would not care to attempt to describe apparent differences in the
plumage of the males and females because I could not see any. I did
notice, however, that these Nutmegs here seem darker in colour than
the birds I have seen on the Australian mainland in birdshops and those
I have kept myself. This, of course, may be pure imagination.
Other birds I have observed and which are fairly common are two
species of Sunbirds, one jet black with beautiful shot effects through its
plumage. Apart from some Parrots this is easily the most beautiful
bird I have seen here. I was fortunate enough to observe one feeding
on the honey from the flowers of a paw paw tree and he was no more
than two feet from my eyes ; how he missed seeing me I cannot
imagine, perhaps he was too busy feeding. As he turned in the sun
his head turned from jet black to a beautiful glossy green, his wings
similarly turned to a beautiful deep shade of blue, and for a brief
moment I caught a flash of yellow as he turned again in the sun.
The other Sunbird is very common ; it is yellow with a purplish-
black throat, also glossy and giving different colours as it turns on the
paw paw flowers. The female is plain yellow being slightly darker on
the back. This species is almost exactly similar to a bird I have observed
in the hills behind Cairns in North Queensland.
I have seen two species of Parrots either of which would gladden the
hearts of the Parrot lovers at home. One is brilliant scarlet and is about
the size of the Australian Red Lowrie ; it has brilliant green wings and
a touch of bright yellow on the head, it has a short tail.
The other is slightly larger and brilliant green all over. Both of these
Parrots feed on berries and the natives have them for pets. Some are
very tame and will sit on one's shoulder. They are really beautiful
and I would like to take some home, but there are the laws of the
country which ban Parrots of any kind.
Apart from these the only other birds that are of interest are a
Wagtail, identical with the Australian Black and White Wagtail only
half as large again, and a fairly large glossy Blackbird about the same
size as a Starling.
The vegetation on this island consists of coco-nut trees, giant fig trees
which tower into the sky, bananas, paw paws, a tree climbing palm and
a myriad of fern type plants which would be an asset to any garden.
The palms grow around the coast and inland there are dense almost
impenetrable forests.

90 DEREK GOODWIN-ODD HOURS WITH BROWN-NECKED RAVENS
ODD HOURS WITH THE BROWN-NECKED
RAVENS

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999262102564103" page_id="56288870"  page_num="90" year="" vol="">
I first made their acquaintance on the 20th December, 1945. I had
rambled about two miles into the desert to the east of our camp, a
grim expanse of brown hills and valleys stretching away seemingly
endlessly to the east and south, from which one could look westward
a paler and less hilly stretch of desert, where the two great pyramids
dominate both near and distant landscape as they have for long
centuries past, and will perhaps for longer centuries to come than will
many of our contemporary achievements be remembered.
A vibrant croak, hoarse but not unmusical, caused me to look
upwards, a Brown-necked Raven was circling overhead, its long wings
and graduated tail giving it, when thus seen etched against the pale
blue monotone of a cloudless sky, an almost Falcon-like appearance,
at least by comparison with its humbler relative, the cheerful plebeian
Hooded Crow of the cultivated regions. The bird flew forward a short
distance, then, closing its wings, fell earthwards in a spinning nose
dive for about a dozen yards, checked its fall on suddenly outflung
wings, and glided up in a gentle arc to repeat the performance. It
was the first time I had witnessed this aerial play of the Raven which
is familiar to most people who have had the opportunity and time to
watch the British sub-species, and I could not but in some degree share
the bird's thrill, as, apparently completely out of control, it hurtled
earthwards croaking excitedly, and feel a sense of relief each time it
flung out its wings and became airborne once again.
Many naturalists have denied that birds have sufficient intelligence
to be capable of playing, certainly the casual observer is often apt to
misinterpret apparently light-hearted phases of bird-flight whose
primary function is that of sexual display, and if by play we mean to
indulge in organized and premeditated forms of activity with the
deliberate intention of deriving pleasure therefrom, then it is fairly
certain that birds have not sufficient, or, perhaps it would be fairer to
say, not the requisite type of mental capacity to play. But if by " play "
we mean the spontaneous indulgence in activities serving no material
ends, though very obviously affording pleasurable sensations, either
physical or mental or both to the participant, then I think it must be
admitted that birds do play at times and the Ravens more than most.
After a few minutes a second Raven appeared in the sky, at which
the first bird ceased its gambols and they flew away together. I thought
little more about them until, about a mile further on, I came to a
deep rocky gorge about a quarter of a mile in length ; grim and

forbidding, its bed nourished only a few small stunted desert shrubs,
whilst the scent of a fox, rank and heavy among the tumbled rocks,
a painted lady flitting along before me (is there any time or season in
the Near East when, if the sun is shining, one does not see this loveliest
of butterflies ?), and a Mourning Chat perched on a boulder uttering
his plaintive melody, were the only signs of animal life. But looking
at the many holes and crevices in the steep rock-face on either side
it occurred to me that here surely was an ideal nesting place for the
Brown-necked Ravens, and I determined to pay further visits later
in the year.
My next visit was on the 25th February, when I was accompanied
by a friend who is also an enthusiastic bird-watcher. The Ravens
were not " at home ", but we located the nest in a horizontal crevice
in the rock-face. Owing to its position it was only possible to see the
outer part of the nest, so that we could only surmise as to how far
building had progressed. From the groynd it looked quite reachable,
as nests usually do ! Rock-climbing is not, however, one of my strong
points, and by the time I had reached a narrow ledge about half-way
to the nest it was forced upon me, firstly that I could certainly go no
further upwards, and secondly that getting down again seemed likely
to prove only a little less difficult. A Crag Martin glided to and fro
in exquisitely light and effortless flight, several times the little dingy
grey swallow paused to hover a few feet away from my face, eyeing
with curiosity apparently unmixed with fear the strange monster that
had invaded its domain ; below my friend waited rather anxiously
and the Mourning Chat flitted among the boulders.
Needless to say, I descended without mishap despite my cowardly
misgivings, and hardly had I done so when we heard the croaking of
the returning Ravens and hastily sat down with our backs to the
nesting cliff as the birds came flying along the top of the gorge. From
experience of other birds in similar circumstances we expected that
they would betray sufficient anxiety at our presence to make it obvious
that they had a nest in the vicinity ; but we were wrong, as they
sighted us they checked their flight for a split second, flung a few
hurried gutteral notes at one another, and came straight on, flying
past without so much as a glance at the crevice. They were merely
passing by ; there was nothing of interest to them here so why should
they loiter ? Up past the head of the gorge they flew and away over
the desert.
Owing to being whisked away for a brief sojourn in the Lebanon,
I was unable to revisit the gorge until the 25th March. The hen
Raven was incubating, the tip of her tail projecting over the side of the
nest was visible ; but I had scarcely caught sight of it when she changed
her position, so that owing to the gloom of the nesting site, the rock
shelf forming its roof coming almost to the edge of the nest, it was

<bodyText confidence="0.9997134" page_id="56288872"  page_num="92" year="" vol="">
impossible to see if a bird was present or not. Whether this move on
her part was inspired by the knowledge that she had in her former
position been visible from below, or whether she was merely placing
herself in one more convenient for keeping an eye on the unwelcome
intruder is a moot point ; the latter alternative seems more likely,
although by no means certain, since birds are not so uniformly un-
intelligent as some modern writers on the subject, with their dread of
falling into the error of anthropomorphism would have us believe.
At least a score of the Egyptian race of the Common Swift were
present, now high in the air above the gorge, now sweeping past one's
head with a hissing rush of narrow wings to shoot up suddenly into
one of the many holes honeycombing the underside of an overhanging
shelf of rock. Wonderful creatures that have far outstripped other
land birds in mastery of the air and relative independence of the earth,
and perhaps for that reason having something uncanny, almost
repellent, about them, lacking, despite their boldness and their great
beauty of flight, that air of gentle trustfulness and fragile grace that
makes the swallow tribe so appealing.
A pair of Lanner Falcons swept down from the upper airs and
hung motionless on outspread wings watching us ; they dashed down-
wind along the sides of the gorge, turned, and flew back, obviously
scanning en route some favoured nest site, hung once more " at
anchor " on the upward air currents for several minutes, to drop and
fly anxiously about the gorge again, till with an apparent sudden loss
of interest they rose in a series of graceful circles and drifted back into
the sky whence they had come. After about an hour the cock Raven
returned, but seeing us flew off again, evidently alighting on the
desert near by, since we could hear his intermittent croaking close at
hand. We departed ostentatiously, and before we had gone a couple
of hundred yards we heard the two birds loudly voicing their relief
at our departure, and a moment later saw them soaring together
above the gorge, still conversing excitedly. Of our first acquaintance,
the Mourning Chat, there had been no sign ; at the time we thought
he was merely away on a foraging expedition or taking a brief siesta
in some shady spot among the rocks as his kind often do during the
hotter hours of the day, but as I never saw him again he had either
taken up quarters elsewhere or else fallen a victim to the Lanner
Falcons or some other bird of prey.
On the 4th April affairs were much the same, except that the
Lanners betrayed far more anxiety, flying about the gorge or
" waiting on " immediately above throughout my visit, and when the
cock Raven appeared, which he did in a very short time, the con-
spicuous bulge in the upper part of his throat, that convenient " hold-
all " for the corvidae when food-collecting, lent weight to my surmise
that the young must by now have hatched, although not proving it,

since the Brown-necked Raven, like other crows, feeds his mate during
the nesting season. My search for the Lanner's nest was unsuccessful,
but I discovered that on the opposite side of the gorge it was possible
to climb down to a comfortable recess from which, with the aid of
field-glasses, one could obtain a far better view of the opposite cliff-
face than was possible from the bed of the gorge, although
unfortunately the interior of the Raven's nest was still invisible.
On the 14th April the hen Raven flew from the nest as I came in
sight over the top of the gorge and settled on a ledge some fifty yards
away, uttering a harsh crow-like " karr karr karr ", a note evidently
used both to warn the young birds to keep silent, and also, as many
" warning " notes are, as an expression of anger directed at the
intruder. She flew uneasily from ledge to ledge, occasionally taking
a short circling flight above the gorge. Twice she perched quite near
at hand, and I was able to admire the beautiful purplish chestnut of
her neck and breast, so dark as to appear black in a poor light or at a
distance, and the oily blue sheen of her wings and back, always taking
care to avoid the vicinity of the nest and repeating her monotonous
outcry at intervals of about half a minute.
After about twenty minutes her mate returned ; as he came in
sight the hen left the gorge and alighted in the desert about a hundred
and fifty yards away ; the cock bird glided down and pitched beside
her. After a good deal of mutual croaking (one is tempted to risk
being anthropomorphic and say conversation) she returned to the
gorge and he flew off in the direction whence he had come.
A sudden beating of wings jerked my attention from the hen Raven,
who, perched on a ledge at no great distance was relieving her feelings
by prising out loose stones and tossing them over the edge, and saw
below and in front of me the hen Lanner Falcon, so close that I could
clearly see the narrow dark striations on her buff head that contrasted
so strikingly with the dark slaty brown of her wings and back. Clearly
she had just flown off her nest, which must therefore be in one of the
many holes and crannies in the cliff opposite, but which one ? The
Lanner swerved upwards, gaining height rapidly without visible
effort, glided hesitantly with a very obvious display of interest along
the cliff-face, rose again, soaring so high that I feared she did not
intend to return for some time, then as if all her fears had suddenly
been swept away she turned, came back in a lovely swooping glide,
alighted without hesitation at the edge of an open cavity directly
opposite my " look-out " recess, looked at me over her shoulder for
a few moments, and then walked gently in on to her nest, settled the
eggs (which I could not see owing to the depression in which they
were laid) comfortably under her with that familiar shuffling movement
which seems common to birds of every type, and sat brooding in full
view as serene and unperturbed as a domestic Pigeon.

On the 21 st the Tanner was still brooding, beyond a brief g'ance
she ignored my presence opposite her, even after a little while leaving
the nest to stand in her " doorway " stretching her wings and legs
before returning to her task. The hen Raven, however, although she
never showed signs of any great degree of personal fear, had no
intention of trusting me with the knowledge of her family's where-
abouts, and behaved as on the previous week, except that when I left
the gorge she circled around me still scolding harshly, and after
escorting me in this manner for about a quarter of a mile she alighted
on the sand and to my astonishment allowed me to approach to
within twenty yards of her. I did not risk going any nearer, although
she seemed quite at ease ; after a few minutes she cocked her head on
one side, looking skywards with one hard black eye. High overhead
a Kite was passing, drifting without effort on its wide ragged wings.
The Raven leapt into the air, uttering a peculiarly hoarse short note,
repeated rapidly and without intermission, on violently beating wings
she rose in spiral flight. In her excited haste she appeared to make
little headway, but in a surprisingly short time she was above the Kite,
who had made no effort to escape. It was a typical " Kite and Grow "
battle, but the Raven's swoops were fiercer and swifter than those of
a Hooded Crow. Still the Kite managed to hold his own, usually
succeeding in jerking over on to his back and presenting the in-
vulnerable menace of his upthrust talons in time to ward off the
attacks of his enemy.
However, whilst the fight was still at this indecisive stage a faint
croaking, like a distant echo of the hen Raven's frenzied clamour,
sounded in the distance, and the cock bird came flying at full speed
to join in the fray. Matters now began to look serious for the poor
Kite. In vain he jerked over to present his talons to one Raven ;
the moment he righted himself and before he could repeat the
manoeuvre the other was on him. Soon he abandoned defensive tactics
and directed his energy solely in efforts to escape. He made some
headway, but only at the cost of many buffets from his attackers'
feet and the loss of many feathers ripped from his head and back by
their great bills. All three were gradually moving away from the
gorge, but the Kite, in spite of his desperate endeavours to prevent it,
was being gradually forced lower and lower, and I began to think
that in the end he would be grounded and wondered what would
happen if he was, when the hen Raven, evidently satisfied that the
interloper was safely out of the territory that she deemed herself
responsible for guarding, returned to the gorge in one long steep
glide, where her mate, having harried the Kite for another furlong
or so, rejoined her.
When I next visited them on the 28th the two old birds were foraging
at the edge of the desert, about three miles away from the gorge. I was

just wondering if they were indeed " my " Ravens when, as they flew
leisurely by at a little distance, one of them, I think almost certainly
the hen, checked in its flight, flew hesitantly a few yards towards me,
and then recognizing me she came and hovered only thirty yards
away, cursing me in her usual manner for a few moments and then
flew off homewards followed by her mate. That the bird had
recognized me despite the fact that we were in an area given over to
target practice and hence much frequented by troops (indeed, there
were other soldiers in the vicinity prior to my arrival, whom the
Ravens had ignored), was proved by her actions ; but I should dearly
like to know whether she " put two and two together " and deduced
that I was on my way to her domain, or whether it was merely that,
her anxiety having been aroused, she automatically returned to the
spot on which it was centred.
Both birds were present on my arrival, but the cock immediately
soared into the sky and drifted away. His mate remained as usual, but,
the day being rather hot, spent most of the time perched, beak agape,
on a well-shaded ledge uttering her warning notes at much less
frequent intervals than on previous occasions. The Lanner was no
longer brooding, her nest site was empty. The Falcons appeared and
glided about the gorge, aloof and beautiful, as though too proud and
of too noble lineage to betray sorrow at their loss. Who was the
culprit ? One can only guess, I am fairly sure that no other human
being knew of the nest, and that no fox could have reached it. I fear
my friends the Ravens were responsible ; true they never molested the
adult Lanners in the gorge, but they must have been aware of the
nest so near their own. Perhaps in her mate's absence the brooding
Falcon, excited by the sight of some tempting prey passing near,
left her nest to fly impetuously in pursuit and the Ravens at once took
the opportunity for which they had long watched and waited. This is
the merest conjecture, but I can think of no other explanation that
fits the facts of the case.
On the following day the heat was intense, and the hen Raven,
who was present in the gorge on my arrival, was obviously suffering
more than a little. She perched on the shadiest part of the cliff panting,
with widely gaping beak, her half-open wings hanging limply ; beyond
watching us she ignored my friend and me and made no sound. Perhaps
she realized that there was little fear of any self-betraying clamour
from her offspring, as the rock-face in which the nest was placed
received the full glare of the sun from noon till evening, and the heat
within the crevice must have been stifling, and the young within have
suffered a great deal more than their parents without, who could at
least seek the comparative coolness of the upper air or the shady side
of the gorge.
At my next visit on 5th May I walked up the bed of the gorge and

in so doing disturbed a little grey desert hare, which leapt up and sped
away before me. Instantly there was a rush of torn air as the hen
Lanner, who had evidently been " waiting-on 55 overhead, stooped at
it in a breath-taking dive, with the two Ravens close behind her ;
but to no avail, since the hare had only to leap a yard to one side to
reach cover among the piled-up boulders, and, of course, did so.
I must confess that I viewed its escape without much enthusiasm,
since the sympathy which most of us feel for any hunted creature
whose death or capture will bring us no advantage, was rather over-
ridden by my interest to see whether the Falcon would be capable of
holding and killing so large a prey, and whether if she succeeded in
so doing the Ravens would attempt, either by force or guile, to take
it from her, as I rather expected would be the case. I had brought
a dead Pigeon with me in order to observe the Ravens 3 reactions to
it, and thought that perhaps with its aid as a " stand-in 33 for the
vanished hare the stage might still be set for the next act to carry on.
Holding it by the legs I jerked it about over my head. I cannot say
that it gave the desired impression of a live bird struggling to escape
from my grasp, but the Lanner, thinking perhaps that the un-natural
movements indicated some injury that would render it an easy prey,
at once descended and hovered eagerly over my head, afraid to come
nearer but ready to stoop at the Pigeon the instant it broke loose
from my clutches. When, however, I threw the bird from me and it
flew in a whirling arc to hit the ground with a minor version of the
" sickening thud 33 , so familiar to readers of detective fiction, its
moribund condition was evident to the least discerning, and the
Falcon, apparently scorning the role of carrion-eater, soared up and
away.
I climbed to my look-out recess and awaited developments. The
Ravens suffered from no high-minded scruples as to how or where the
Pigeon had died, but they had seen it in my hands and they could see
me watching, and they were taking no chances. The cock flew off
as usual, leaving the hen to guard the area and keep her eye on me ;
thrice she flew low over the dead Pigeon, eyeing it keenly but not
attempting to alight. The Crag Martin, who was always present in
the gorge (it may have had a mate, but I never saw another within a
mile), glided back and forth ; twice it paused, hovering, and at length,
stretching out its small dark spidery legs, it dropped lightly on to a
narrow ledge only four feet away and preened itself in the most con-
fiding manner for several minutes before resuming flight. The Lanners
returned, sweeping down from the sky and pitching in somewhere
out of sight on my side of the gorge. After some time the cock Raven
returned and flew at once towards the corpse, but seeing I was still
present resumed his flight, just when he had been on the point of
alighting, and joined his mate who was on her usual perch. I left,

feeling sure that once I was safely out of sight they would overcome
their suspicions and enjoy the feast I had provided ; the hen once
again escorted me for some distance, uttering the customary male-
dictions, although I think, and hope, that by that time she was aware
of my innocuousness and only scolded out of force of habit.
On the 13 th May only a few Swifts were present in the gorge, but
towards evening, having spent the afternoon further afield, I saw the
two Ravens flying low over the desert, and following them on awkward
hesitant wings a third and smaller specimen. As I watched the hen
bird broke away and, flying towards me, hovered above and then
settled on the sand near by, scolding in her usual manner. This may
have been an attempt to attract my attention from the young one, or
to warn it of a potential enemy, but I am inclined to think that this
reaction to my appearance had become almost automatic, so that the
same feelings being aroused were expressed in the same way, although
the need for that form of reaction was no longer present, as on several
future occasions when I came upon the little family out in the desert
she behaved in the same manner, even after the young bird was as
strong on the wing as herself.
I often wonder whether the young Raven started life as an only
child, since I imagine that the Brown-necked Raven, like its congeners,
normally lays from two to six eggs, or whether there were brothers or
sisters who perished of the heat or, falling into the gorge before they
could fly up to some safe perch, fell a victim during the hours of dark-
ness to some prowling fox.
When in late July I last saw the Ravens who had given me so
many hours of interest, the youngster was as large as his parents and
evidently independent, although still keeping in their company. For
the first time the hen bird did not react to my presence, presumably
not through failure to recognize me, but because since she had by now
ceased to care for her offspring she experienced no anxiety at my
appearance.

By D. H. S. Risdon
As I have previously stated, small birds of the size of a Sparrow and
under are not a success in very large aviaries. The bigger birds show
up well, even at a distance, but many of the little ones have naturally
retiring habits and spend most of their time skulking in the under-
growth. Even those that don't do this have a tendency to stay at the
opposite end of the aviary to where you are standing. Moreover
there is little in the way of special titbits one can use as a means of
gaining their confidence, as one can with softbills and many larger
species. Then again, and this is most important, it is next to impossible
to give them the care and attention which, above all, the small ones,
especially the foreigners, need.
In the early years of the aviary's existence it was populated by
a number of British Finches and later by various hardy Weavers and
Whydahs. This arrangement worked well for a time until I began
to go in for Australian Finches, when I found that, if successful
breeding results were wanted, they would have to be controlled in
such a way that I could keep my eye on them and watch for the ever
present danger of chills and eggbinding to which these little birds
are so prone.
Accordingly I built a range of small flights down one side of the
existing shelter shed and inside the big aviary itself. Each flight,
which measured 3 feet by 2 feet, opened into the shelter shed, wherein
was partitioned off a small area 2 feet by 2 feet. I thus had a range
of little aviaries, consisting of flight and shelter, each of an overall
length of 5 feet by 2 feet.
The earth in such enclosures would have quickly become fouled,
so the floors of the flights were raised 4 feet from the ground and
were made of wire netting, through which all droppings fell, thus
ensuring cleanliness and preventing the birds from picking about on
ground soiled by their own excreta.
To make up for the lack of earth, clean turves were supplied and
renewed as often as necessary, and, in these little aviaries, such species
as Gouldians, Diamond Doves, and White Java Sparrows did
remarkably well.
To deal first with the birds that had the freedom of the big aviary,
I think a pair of Bullfinches were about the earliest of all to be turned
in after it was completed. This pair I had had for several years
previously, during part of which time they had occupied cages and
part small aviaries. They were pretty tame and had, on one occasion,
nested and got as far as hatching young which were then allowed to die.

It was in the autumn of 1929 when they were put in, and through-
out the winter they thoroughly enjoyed themselves. How thoroughly
I did not realize till the spring came round and the trees and shrubs
outside the aviary burst into green. Such evergreens as were inside
were all right, but the deciduous types showed not a leaf. I had of
course noticed the Bullfinches eating buds, and beautiful they looked,
poised on the swaying twigs of the hazels, but I had not imagined
they would be so thorough !
As I did not want the look of the whole aviary ruined for the sake
of two birds I reluctantly caught them up and they were later sold.
After their removal the trees budded again, and in due course put
out fresh leaves.
A pair of Chaffinches occupied the aviary for years and nested
regularly every spring. The number of young actually reared to
maturity was, however, small, due partly, I think, to insufficient live
insect food of the right kind. They usually nested two or three times
a year, but the young were reared to the feathering stage and then
neglected. Mealworms and gentles were supplied as extras, but
in a mixed collection it is always difficult to ensure that any particular
pair of birds gets what is specially put in for it.
Every softbill in the aviary knew at once when I had put fresh
mealworms in the special pot, kept for the purpose near the Chaffinches'
nest, however surreptitiously I did it, and the moment I stood back
down they used to pop to help themselves, with the result that the
Chaffinches got about one mealworm each !
They generally built their nests in the ivy which climbed up the
wall of the shelter shed. The nests themselves, which were not as well
finished as those built by wild Chaffinches, due no doubt to the lack
of the correct materials, were nevertheless quite beautiful, being lined
with the bright feathers of Golden Pheasants and Mandarin Ducks.
Greenfinches were kept for some years. They were wild caught
ones and never became in the least bit tame. They are reputed to be
easy breeders in captivity, but mine never attempted to nest although
they had the run of the entire aviary. Incidentally I am sure they
were a true pair.
Their end was sudden and tragic. One night the door leading
from the compartment occupied by the Little Owls was left open
and in the morning all that could be seen were a few green feathers
under the privet bush where they habitually roosted.
Weavers were purchased some years after the aviary had been
going. They consisted of Napoleons and Grenadiers and were all
bought out of colour. Consequently it was impossible to sex them.
When eventually they did come into colour, if I remember rightly,
all three Grenadiers revealed themselves to be cocks, and five out of
six Napoleons were cocks.

This preponderance of males among the common Weavers and
Whydahs was borne out by my experience in later years when handling
many of these birds. It is a strange phenomenon because, as often
as not, they are imported in eclipse plumage when there is no ready
means of sexing them. Consequently the trappers could hardly be
expected to pick out only cocks to send over.
Moreover many presumably immature birds do not come into
colour during their first year in this country, which makes their
owners think they have hens, only to be confounded the following
year when they reveal their true identity.
My Weavers built many nests, both when they were in colour and
in eclipse plumage. They generally chose the top stems of elder bushes
to which to attach their nests, which were woven from strips of green
rushes taken from those growing round the pond.
The manner in which the birds tore off these strips was interesting
to watch. They climbed down to the base of a clump of rushes, made
an incision in the leaf near the root, and then flew off, tearing a long
strip from base to tip of the rush leaf as they went.
The Grenadiers lived until the aviary was disposed of, but the
Napoleons went off in fits one by one, some even after two colour
changes in the aviary. I remember seeing one, apparently perfectly
well, drop suddenly to the ground in a paroxysm and die almost
immediately. Their corpses were always fat and in good condition,
and I have a suspicion that over indulgence in fattening foods may
have been the cause of their trouble. They were partial to minced
house scraps put down for the Pheasants and waterfowl, but as against
this they had the run of the whole aviary wherein to exercise and work
off any ill effects of such fare. Moreover, such active birds took full
advantage of so much space. Weavers are seldom still and are excellent
aviary inmates, being given to showing themselves off in prominent
positions and not hiding in the bushes as do so many otherwise
attractive foreign Finches.
Paradise Whydahs, of which half a dozen were turned in with the
Napoleons, were equally showy, but in their case, unlike the Weavers,
they were steady and tame ; stupidly so, with the result that several
got badly mauled by my Purple-headed Glossy Starlings. The Whydahs
therefore had to go before I had the pleasure of seeing them come
into colour.
Canaries do not normally come within the scope of the Avicultural
Magazine, but I should like to mention the few that graced this aviary
from time to time, and gave me almost as much pleasure as any of
the other inmates.
Cage bred ones were not much good. They obviously did not
know what to do with so much space and looked unhappy and lost.
Outdoor aviary bred ones were, however, an entirely different

proposition. They swooped and darted about as skilfully as any Gold-
finch, and their bright yellow colouring made them very conspicuous.
The cocks sang all the year round, except perhaps for a few weeks
when moulting, and as they had no fear of human presence I was
able to enjoy their antics to the full. They were enormous greenfood
eaters, constantly nibbling the leaves of trees and plants. I should
imagine that a number in a planted aviary would be as destructive
as a similar number of Budgerigars, but I never kept more than a
pair or two at a time so the damage they did was negligible.
Always tight plumaged, alert, and active they were very different
birds to their cage kept brethren.
I was unsuccessful with Gouldians till I found a better way of keeping
them than letting them loose in a large planted aviary. Under such
conditions their beauty was completely lost. I had not realized it
before, but the colour and pattern of a Gouldian Finch is a wonderful
camouflage amongst the light and shade of green foliage. Being rather
sedate birds by nature they would sit about in the elder bushes, and
it was quite a puzzle to find them until they happened to move.
When they did decide to fly their progress was swift and sure, and the
only impression one had was of a small greenish bird whizzing past
one's head.
After several losses, due to my inability to control them and watch
over them for incipient illness, I built the range of little flights described
at the beginning of this article and, from then on, was much more
successful.
With the usual erratic behaviour of Gouldians sometimes they
bred well, rearing a brood as easily as Zebra Finches. At other
times they failed. Eggbinding was the chief bogy, due of course,
to their habit of spending the few short months of the English summer
moulting and then coming into breeding condition just when the
first autumn frosts began. On the occasions, however, when the
dangerous laying period was satisfactorily completed, success usually
came their way. I shall never forget my first sight of a nest full of
young ones. All that I could see were a cluster of small, blue, shining
beads of light waving about in the dark interior of the nest.
Losses among adults were reduced to practically nil, due I feel sure
to the fact that whilst enjoying the benefits of sunshine and fresh air
the raised wire netting floors of the flights prevented them from
picking about on ground possibly infected by other birds. Incidentally
they never had artificial heat.
Pre-war avicultural literature used to stress the need for correctly
balanced bird diets and I was for ever trying to get my Gouldians
to eat other things beside millet and canary-seed without much
success. I was oblivious to the fact that they throve and reared
excellent young ones on just this plain fare, with a little seeding grass

as well, and was always trying to get them to eat greenfood and soft
food and putting such things as Virol in their drinking water.
Truth to tell I think that many of our birds, especially the Australian
Grassfinches, are very frugal feeders and obtain all the nourishment
they need from millet and canary-seed. In this connection spray
millet seems to possess some quality over the ordinary seed which
gives it the same attraction to seed-eating birds as mealworms have
for softbills.
My experiences with Zebra Finches were exactly the reverse of
those with the Gouldians. Left to themselves in the big aviary they
throve, building themselves nests out of doors and rearing families,
as far as I could make out, all the year round, regardless of weather.
Certainly one brood fledged at Christmas time with apparently no
ill effects. I think that their habits of spending their nights and parts
of their days in their cosy warm nests saved them from eggbinding
and chills. It was amusing to watch them at dusk coaxing their newly
fledged offspring back to the nest. They were most solicitous about
them and never rested till all were inside.
When, at a later date, they were confined to the small flights, one
pair to a compartment, they never reared another young one. In
fact it was some time even before they went to nest at all. Eventually
eggs were laid, but if any young ever hatched they never reached
maturity.
White Java Sparrows did much better in the small flights than
loose in the big aviary. In their case, however, the reason was partly
due to quarrelling, as there were two pairs, both of which happened
to pick on the same nest-box. As usually happens in these cases
neither pair would give in, and so many weeks were wasted whilst
they bickered and fought. Looking back now I cannot understand
why I did not remove the bone of contention, when both pairs would
probably have settled down elsewhere in separate boxes and got on
with the business of raising families.
When the small flights were built one pair was sold and the other
transferred to a compartment where they went to nest at once and
reared a brood of four. Although the parents were pure white the
colouring of their progeny made me feel that at some time in the past
the hen, like the young man named Saki, must have had an affair
with a darky, the result of her sins being quadruplets, not twins,
one white, two pied, and one khaki, that being the approximate colour
of the dark one in nest feather, which, of course, eventually became
a normal grey. Of the two pied ones, the lightly marked one moulted
out pure white, but the other remained pied.
They were difficult birds to sex. The first two I ever bought were
sold to me as a pair and, in fairness to the vendor, it must be said
that they looked an obvious cock and hen. The beak of one was much

broader and heavier than that of the other, but that only went to
prove how individual birds can vary. It was not until many weeks
later, having become suspicious of their lack of interest in each other,
that I caught the supposed hen singing and dancing quietly to
I "herself". Then I had one of those rare lucky breaks. I wrote
away to a dealer for two hen White Javas and actually received--
two hen White Javas--whose sex was obvious as soon as they were
introduced to the two cocks.
My first efforts with Diamond Doves were similarly thwarted by
being sold two hens as a pair. Here again they were completely
unlike each other &gt;; one being much more stoutly built and much
bluer in colour than the other. Had I known Diamond Doves then
as well as I got to know them later, I should have realized that some-
thing was amiss because cock Diamond Doves, like all their tribe,
are never happier than when cooing and displaying to their lady
loves, whereas these two sat in heaps all day long and looked
unutterably bored with life. Up till now they had been loose in the
main aviary, but I eventually exchanged one of them for a cock and
the pair were placed in one of the small finch flights, where they
reared several excellent broods of young, always preferring to make
their scanty nests on the wire floor of the flight, up in one corner,
and scorning the shallow boxes which I carefully fixed up for them
on the walls.
My first pair of Bengalese were tried loose in the aviary, along with
the other Finches at first, and, strangely enough, made much more
use of the space than I expected of such artificial little birds. They
hopped and climbed about among the bushes with much tail flirting
and obviously were enjoying sensations which must have been foreign
to them and their kind for centuries ; if what the bird books tell us
about their ancestry is true.
They went to nest there, annexing the usual type of wooden finch
nest-box, and reared a few nice young ones. Later on they were
confined in a small finch flight, where, although they continued to
thrive, their breeding results were not so good, largely because I rather
messed them about by putting Gouldian eggs under them which,
even when they did hatch, they seldom made a success of rearing.
I bought a pair of aviary-bred Bichenos one autumn, intending to
breed with them the following year, but the aviary came to an end
before these hopes were realized. For six months, however, I and all
who saw them were entertained by these quaint owl-faced mites,
whose lack of brilliant colours was amply made up for by their delicately
beautiful markings in black and white. Something about their shape
and quick spritely movements reminded me as much of Tits as of
Finches, and this likeness was accentuated by their habit of sleeping
side by side in a coco-nut shell. If you looked at them when they

were inside all you saw were two small white faces, each encircled
by a black ring, staring at you for all the world like those of two
tiny Owls.
I had been warned that Pin tailed Nonpareil Parrot Finches were !
difficult birds to keep, but one day, seeing what looked like a true
pair in a London dealer's shop, I was so smitten by their lovely
colouring that I decided to try my hand at them, even though the
cock was minus a foot.
They were fed on paddy rice and the vendor told me that the secret
of success with them was to keep them on this diet and not try to
force them on to any other food. Their strong black beaks were
certainly capable of cracking such hard fare, and throughout their
stay with me I always left paddy rice before them. They soon learnt
to eat canary seed as well, however, but I do not think millet was
ever taken.
Their only attraction was their beautiful colouring, quite the
loveliest of all the Parrot Finches ; but one seldom had the
chance to admire it because of their wildness and their maddening
habit of flitting from end to end of their aviary so fast that the eye
could hardly follow.
With the onset of autumn the supposed hen, which until then had
been garbed in dull green with a faint pinkish flush on the abdomen
and a dull red tail, revealed its true sex by moulting into male plumage
even more resplendent than that of its one-footed companion.
During the winter I bought another dull plumaged Pintailed
Nonpareil, and this time I think I really had a hen. The other one
had always had, even in immature plumage, very slight points to its
two central tail feathers, but the newcomer had a perfectly square-
ended tail.
Although they lived with me and throve for some six months the
prophecy that they were difficult birds proved true in the end. There
came one of those mild muggy spells of winter weather which frequently
succeed a cold one, and one morning all three birds, which the day
before had appeared perfectly fit, were found dead. The post mortem
report was pneumonia as it so often is in the case of small foreign
Finches.
So ends my account of an aviary which lasted from 1929 to 1937
and was a source of as much joy to me as any part of my avicultural
career. From it I learned that where good breeding results, that is
to say where large numbers of young, are the main object, a separate
aviary for each pair of birds is the best rule.
If, however, one keeps birds primarily for the pleasure of possessing
them and watching their interesting and amusing ways, with breeding
results as a secondary consideration, the large planted aviary cannot
be beaten.

As I have described in this and previous articles breeding can be
quite successful in a mixed aviary, and young can be reared provided
you select your species with care and take note of individual
temperaments.
You will not get the fullest enjoyment from your birds unless you
give them mates, so that you can watch the different phases of their
life cycle the year round.
A collection of bachelor birds looks very nice but becomes deadly
dull after a while, unless you are constantly changing your collection
or adding something to it. Your birds will eat and sleep and potter
idly about in a bored fashion, and you will miss all the wonderful
and interesting reactions and displays towards one another, which
are manifest during the courtships and breeding period.
Since commencing this series of articles the war has come to an
end sooner, it must be confessed, than was expected. I feel justified
therefore in finishing on a more optimistic note than that on which
I started, and expressing the hope that the time surely cannot be
very far away when those of us who have been for so long without
our hobby may soon be back at it, as deeply absorbed in it as ever.

The Chairman in his opening address said that this meeting was
an event of very considerable importance, as it was the first to be
held by the Club. He sincerely hoped that members would make
every endeavour to ensure the success of subsequent meetings. The
B.O.C. had flourished for over fifty years, and there was no reason
why the B.A.C. should not enjoy similar success. He urged members to
bring exhibits, rare live birds, first breedings, skins, and other items
of avicultural interest, and to enter into discussions generally.
Mr. N. B. Kinnear exhibited two photographs of a West African
Grey Parrot from the waxworks at Westminster Abbey, and made
the following remarks :--
" Some years ago, when the cases containing the wax effigies in
Westminster Abbey were opened and the contents removed for
cleaning, a stuffed African Grey Parrot was sent to the Natural History
Museum for examination. The bird formerly belonged to Frances,
Duchess of Richmond and Lennox, better known as La Belle Stuart.
She was the daughter of Dr. Stuart, who was attached to the house-
hold of the Queen Dowager Henrietta Maria in France, and about
1662 she came to London as maid of honour to Catherine of Braganza.
She was a famous beauty and Pepys, who considered himself a great
judge, wrote of her in his diary as one of the most beautiful women
he had ever seen, ' with her hat cocked on one side and a red plume,
sweet eye, little Roman nose, and excellent taile \ Charles II was
much enamoured with her and ultimately she became his mistress.
In 1667 she eloped with the Duke of Richmond and Lennox, but
after her husband's death returned to Court. She purchased the
estate of Lethrington in East Lothian which she bequeathed in her
will to her nephew the Earl of Blantyre with the request that it should
be called Lennoxlove, from Lennox's love of Blantyre. The estate and
mansion have ever since been known by that name. Early in the war
the house was totally destroyed by fire caused by a disabled German
plane falling on it.
" On 15th October, 1702, Frances Stuart died and was buried in
her husband's tomb in Westminster Abbey. Her effigy, at her own
request, was placed close by, dressed in the robes she had worn at
Queen Anne's Coronation and ' as well done in wax as could be,
under crown glass and none other '. She was apparently fond of
animals as well as birds, and besides leaving annuities to some poor
gentlewomen left funds to maintain some of her cats. Hence Pope's
' Die and endow a college or a cat '. She appeared as Britannia on
certain early coins and medals. There are several pictures of the
Duchess, one of which is in Kensington Palace.
" So much for the owner of the Parrot. Of the bird itself we are
told it only survived its mistress by a few days. Possibly it succumbed
to grief, since according to the story it had been in the Duchess's

possession over forty years. This is nearly a record. The late Major
Flower gives two Grey Parrots of 41 and 42 years old and accepts
Gurney's record of a bird which lived for half a century. How the
bird came to be placed with the effigy in the Abbey history does not
relate, and as one old writer says : 'It, however, has fallen to but one
Parrot to arrive at that distinction.'
" The bird, when examined, was in good condition, little faded,
and compared favourably with other examples long exposed in the
exhibition galleries. The skin is mounted on a wooden manikin,
there are no leg wires, but the body is supported by a wire from the
stand to the wooden body. The eyes are of glass, painted on both
sides. Undoubtedly this is the oldest stuffed bird in the country--
over 240 years old.
" The Parrot is a typical West African Grey Parrot first given a
binomial name, Psittacus erithacus by Linnaeus in 1758. His descrip-
tion is not from an actual specimen but based on that of Aldrovandus
in his Historia Naturalium. In that work the bird is called ' De Psittaco
cinereo Sev. sub-caeruleo ' and said to have come from ' Mina Cinitate
D. Georgeo Indica '. This was Elmina or St. George del Mina, a
fortified town a few miles south-west of Cape Coast Castle. Dr. John
Ray, writing in his Synopsis Avium , completed in 1694 but not published
till 1713, remarks that there are many Grey Parrots in London.
The bird Aldrovandus described was most likely a captive bird brought
back from Elmina by traders previous to 1599. But long before that
date there was at least one Grey Parrot in London, some time before
1547. The story about this bird was first, as far as I can discover,
put into print by Conrad Gesner, the Swiss naturalist, and he has
been quoted by many later writers. As that work is not at present
available I quote from Dr. Shaw in his General Z**l*gy&gt; 1812. The
Grey Parrot seems to be the species to which the memorable anecdote,
related by Gesner, refers. The bird belonged to King Henry VIII
and accidentally fell out of the Palace of Westminster into the
Thames ; and then, says Willoughby, "very sensibly remembering the
words it had often heard some, whether in danger or in jest, use, cried
out amain, # A boat, a boat for twenty pounds ! ' A certain experienced
boatman made thither presently, took up the bird, and restored it to
the King, to whom he knew it belonged, hoping for as great a reward
as the bird had promised. The King agreed with the boatman that he
should have as the bird, being asked anew, said : and the answer
' Give the knave a groat '."
Mr. Ezra gave some details of his lutino and blue Alexandrine
Parrakeets. He said that in 1923 he visited his brother in India and
on his return to England, thanks to the generosity of Sir David, he
was able to bring with him an example of both these remarkable
colour varieties. He then dealt briefly with their subsequent breeding

history. After ten years' patient endeavour he succeeded in breeding
a young blue in 1934, and two lutinos in the following year. Whereas
lutino Alexandrines had proved extremely difficult to breed, lutino
Indian Ring-neck were comparatively easy, and he had bred many.
Mr. K. A. Norris said that during his recent service in India he
had seen a Blue Ring-neck. He first saw it high in a mango tree at
Sialkot, Punjab, on 9th August, 1945, and on several subsequent
occasions. It was always with a flock of seven, the remaining six all
being normal. The bird was of a delightful clear greyish blue, not
so brilliant as the sky-blue Budgerigar, but far more attractive than
the blue variety of Masked Lovebirds lately on exhibition at the Zoo.
The pink ring was replaced by similar marking of a greyish white ;
flights and central tail feathers very dark grey and outer tail feathers
almost white. The beak was normal red. The bird seemed abnormally
shy and always remained high in the trees, whereas the others of the
flock were comparatively confiding. Mr. Norris added that he had
seen a caged specimen of a lutino Blossomhead, a cock bird entirely
of a clear golden yellow with the exception of the head which retained
its full normal colour.
Mr. T. Goodwin, on behalf of Mr. E. N. T. Vane, unhappily
prevented by illness from being present, exhibited two mounted
lutino Nyasaland Lovebirds. He said that on his own return from
Australia in 1937 he had brought six of these lutinos, bred there with
several others by Mr. Prendergast. The birds now shown were two of
his importation. As far as he could judge all six were females. In
the discussion that followed Mrs. Younger said that Miss de Pledge
was still managing to maintain her stock of blue Masked Lovebirds
in the Isle of Wight ; and Mr. E. R. W. Lincoln remarked that he
had recently seen several in the aviaries of Mr. G. P. Phillips. They
were in particularly fine condition. Mr. Sydney Porter observed
that in New Zealand Lovebirds had proved most prolific, and that
the various species had inter-bred to such an extent that they were
no longer recognized as Lovebirds, but were known merely as Nyasas.
Mr. K. A. Norris, back from India only a few days previous to
the meeting, gave a very interesting account of visits he had made
to some Indian aviaries.
The meeting finally dispersed at 9.30 p.m.

John Frostick was born at Cockermouth, Cumberland, on 20th June,
1865. After serving as a volunteer in the Border Regiment he went
to Australia in 1885, where he served in the Queensland Scottish.
He soon returned, married, and made his home at Workington until
1895, when he came to London, where he lived until 1940. Son of
a yeoman, " J. F." early showed an interest in natural history generally,
and this interest was to be maintained for many years--his avicultural
experience ranging over a period of sixty-five years.
His first foreign birds were a pair of Budgerigars. He won his first
premier prize at the Crystal Palace Show of 1892, with his famous
King Parrakeet " Invincible Joey ". That win was merely the fore-
runner to many premier honours at the " Palace " and elsewhere,
some outstanding successes being the winning of six " Palace "
Championship Medals, the " Burgess " and " Australasian 55 Trophies
outright, and the " Abraham's Perpetual Trophy " three times.
His birds were always exhibited in faultless condition, but no little
part of his success was due to the fact that he took unlimited trouble
over the correct staging of his exhibits. Judging engagements--his
first was in 1896 for the Kilburn and Maida Vale Fanciers' Society--
prevented his exhibiting on the scale he would have wished.
His knowledge, which he was ever willing to impart, of softbills
and their needs was unique. Who other than "J. F." could have
not only hand-reared a brood of the rare Dartford Warbler, but
have kept one in perfect health for nearly nine years ? This bird--
" Champion Perfection "--shown at all the leading London shows,
probably created a record for the number of " firsts " and " specials "
won by a single bird. Incidentally, a nest-brother was claimed at the
Crystal Palace Show for twelve guineas, at that time a record price
for a small British insectivorous bird.
In 1890 he was the originator of the first show ever held for British
and foreign birds only, at Workington. The judge on that occasion
was Dr. W. T. Greene, of Parrots in Captivity fame. He was one of
the original members of the Council of the United Kingdom Foreign
Cage Bird Society, which held the very first show for foreign birds
only, at Preston in 1891. He was also one of the originators, member
of the first Council, and British bird expert of the Avicultural Society ;
in addition, he was a member of the United Kingdom British Bird
and Mule Club, and afterwards on its reconstruction to the National
B.B. and M.C., he was for several years hon. secretary and
treasurer, and hon. show manager. When he relinquished his various

offices he left the club with over two hundred members, and in
acknowledgment of his services was made an Hon. Life Vice-President.
He organized and managed the great Specialist Show, held by the
N.B.B. and M.C. and Foreign Bird Exhibitors' League, at the Crystal
Palace in 1898, for British and foreign birds only ; where he exhibited--
not for competition--a remarkable and unique collection of thirty
Paradise Whydahs--all cage-moulted and in full colour and plumage,
a sight probably never equalled at any bird show. At the same show
his Tree-creeper--the second of its kind ever exhibited--won first
and special. During his long connection with aviculture he had
many rare exotic birds in his bird-room, and a large number of our
members will have vivid recollections of visits to his house at Streatham.
Books, as well as birds, were the attraction. " J. F." had an unrivalled
knowledge of ornithological works, and could always be relied on to
obtain almost any book in faultless condition.
A staunch supporter of the " Crystal Palace " Shows for some
fifty years, he judged the foreign section at the recent show. Possibly
the strain and excitement were too much for him and he died on
8th March in his eighty-first year and within a few months of his
diamond wedding. The passing of " Old John " leaves a gap in the
ranks of aviculturists that can never be filled. A. A. P.
Whilst I am aware that the Obituary Notice with reference to our
late friend and member, Mr. John Frostick, is in the capable hands
of Mr. Prestwich, I take the opportunity of adding my great
appreciation of his undoubted worth.
It must be over forty-five years ago since I first met him and during
that period the number of exotic species of living birds which passed
through his hands constituted an almost unique experience. Apart
from his great interest and excellent judgment of birds from an
exhibition standpoint, he was a very good bird-keeper and at sexing
those species in which distinctions are not well marked he excelled.
Few men in the past have helped to the same degree in popularizing
the exhibition of exotic species at bird shows and in consequence
caused such gatherings to become of more than ordinary interest.
Of those names which figure among the officials of this Society in
1894 no one survives him.
Through a long association, I look back upon many interesting
incidents relative to birds and bird-keeping shared in his company
and his fund of anecdote concerning these matters was very rich.
Any knowledge or information acquired by him during a period
of over sixty years was always at the disposal of other bird-keepers
and his generosity in this respect, coupled with a natural kindness
and genial manner, will always be remembered by those who came
in contact with him. Allen Silver.

NOTES ON LORIKEETS IN CAPTIVITY IN
AUSTRALIA

A new mutation has turned up in Australia in the Blue Mountain
Lorikeet (Trichoglossus moluccanus). As it may prove of interest to
others I will try to give a description of it.
The back, wings, tail, rump, and undertail coverts a daffodil yellow.
Chest and breast red, with an edging of yellow to each feather. Lower
breast to vent a deep pink.
There are about three feathers on each side of lower breast, purple.
There is also a few green feathers on the shoulder of the wings.
The head, throat, and face are rather hard to describe. Actually
the ground colour is a deep pink, centre of forehead red, with flecking
or splashes of purple and white going through it.
Has the normal band of light green on nape of neck. Under wing
feathers red.
Eyes appear to be normal, but owner said they were black. The
bird was not in bright sunshine and was very timid, so didn't like to
disturb it too much.
The feet are pinkish and the beak is red. The bird is on seed so
it must have been in captivity for a few months.
I was informed that it was a cock, but he had it in with another
normal bird, and to all appearances this normal bird was a cock bird.
A very old bird fancier here was telling me that he had two Yellow
Greenies (Trichoglossus chlorolepidotus, Scaly-breasted Lorikeet) some
years back, but when they moulted the following year they moulted
back to normal Greenies again. I am wondering if this Yellow Blue
Mountain will do the same ?
Perhaps a word or two on the methods as to how they keep Lorikeets
over here in captivity would not go amiss.
I think, generally speaking, most fanciers get their Lorikeets into
seed as soon as possible. This doesn't take long, and they claim
they are better for it and live longer.
The feed used is dry maize meal, which is before them always,
plain canary, sunflower, and milled oats. In addition to these a bit
of apple, pear, or papaw is given about twice a week. Plain or fruit
cake is also given twice a week. For green food lettuce or chick weed.
One chap who has had years of experience with the Lorikeets
tells me that he finds that to get them on to seed is far better than
honey.
He found that white or brown sugar scours the birds and that
Golden Syrup is not as good as honey.
He has kept a Bluie in a cage 4 ft. by 18 in. by 18 in. for sixteen

years, and it has been on seed all this time. A nest is fitted on the
outside of the cage and it breeds every year.
A close watch has to be kept on the birds when youngsters have
been out of the nest a while as the parents will scalp them when they
go to nest again.
All the youngsters have been bred on just what is given to old birds
that are on seed.
He states that the Little Lorikeet (Glossopsitta pusilla) is one of the
hardest Lorikeets to get on to seed. For these he gives milk arrowroot
biscuit soaked with honey water (one teaspoonful of honey to half
a cup of water). I believe this will not go sour.
He has a Greenie mated to a Bluie, but their first lot of eggs were
destroyed by Onarrians. They were given an aviary to themselves,
but didn't attempt to nest again.
He finds that Lorikeets kept in small cages, the ones fed on seed
will outlive the ones that are fed on honey. It appears that the
honey-fed birds need plenty of flying exercise.
Another well-known fancier here feeds his Lorikeets on a slice of
wholemeal bread dampened with water and then spread with honey.
His birds are kept in an aviary that has an outdoor flight so get plenty
of exercise.
This recalls to mind a pair of Blue Mountains a fancier has in
Melbourne.
These birds are on seed and have been in his possession as far back
as I can remember. The cage is 4 ft. by 3 ft. by 2 ft., and the seed
husks in the bottom of the cage are inches deep.
The birds never fail to rear two nests each year, and for the first
nest the birds scratched a hole in the seed husks in one corner and the
hen laid and reared her two chicks on the floor of the cage. A nestbox
was fitted to the outside of the cage after that and they are still keeping
the good work going.
There is one thing that puzzles me when feeding honey-eating birds
and that is why, in practically all cases, is the honey diluted down
and not fed in the pure undiluted form.
We hear of birds taking fits when given pure honey, even to their
deaths, yet I am given to understand honey is just the nectar from
flowers collected by the bees.
Is it then that it undergoes some chemical changes after the bees
have stored it up or does it go into a concentrated form of the nectar ?
Perhaps some of our bird experts can enlighten me on this matter ?

PEAFOWL

<bodyText confidence="0.998907906976744" page_id="56288897"  page_num="113" year="" vol="">
By Francis H. Rudkin, Fillmore, Calif.
Reprinted from Aviculture , Vol. V.
Having had quite a number of letters asking how to manage
Peafowls, I will give my experience. They are one of the most gorgeous
types of bird and do well in pens or at liberty.
There are four varieties : Indian Blue, Java Green, Black-
shouldered, and White. The White is a sport from the Blue, as is
also the Black-shouldered, but each form breeds true to colour.
The Green is a distinct species, and one of the most handsome. It
differs in the formation of the crest and the bare skin of the face, the
latter being blue and yellow, very pronounced ; and its neck and
breast are green, scaled with gold and black. The female of this
species is coloured like the male, but lacks train and tail. The old
Green male is often savage and will attack a man or a dog.
Peahens lay between eight and twelve eggs in a clutch, and we
usually take the first nest of eggs away and let a common hen hatch
and rear them. The Peahen will lay another clutch, which we allow
her to sit on and raise.
The young Peachicks are hatched with wing feathers and are
soon able to fly. Incubation takes between 28 and 30 days. We feed
the young Peachicks hard-boiled egg and cracker crumbs, with much
finely chopped lettuce and spinach. After the third day we give a
saucer of dry chick mash, and sprinkle over a little egg and cracker,
gradually increasing chick meal. They prefer it slightly dampened,
but, above all, we give much green food, and, of course, clean water.
When they are about ten days old, begin grain, with a little millet
seed at first. Since they need more animal food than chickens when
they are larger, occasionally give an egg in the mash, or a bit of
cooked liver.
Feed the adults the same as chickens ; mash in the mornings, green
food at midday, and grain sparingly in the evening. I give for a change
carrots cut up into small pieces, apples, and other cheap fruit. We
find them easier to raise than Turkeys or Pheasants. The adult birds
are very hardy and free from disease, but never should be allowed to
roost in poultry houses with chickens.
Their pen or run should be large, the larger the better, with a
minimum size of 14 feet for a pair, with a roof 6 feet by 4 feet, and one
side enclosed against prevailing wind. Under the roof provide a perch
as high as possible. This recommendation is for Southern California
conditions. My pens are high because they cover a large orange tree
and the Peafowl roost in the tree in summer and in winter with no
other protection.
If I kept one variety only it would be the White Peafowl. They

are easily tamed, and so far I have never found the males vicious ;
and when in full plumage the dazzling white is beauty unsurpassed.
In one of the pens used for the Peafowls I keep Doves, Canaries,
and Finches. In another are twelve pairs of Peach-faced Lovebirds.
I have one Blue Peacock that is very tame. He eats from my hand
and follows me around. He is twelve years old, and I have bred
from him for nine years. Almost all of the eggs have been fertile.
Peafowl are said to live fifty years. When young they are excellent
for food, but are too valuable for that purpose.
The White and Blue Peahens do not lay until their second year,
and the Green do not lay until the third season. Males are not in
full plumage until their third season. At moulting time, usually in
July, the males drop their long train feathers remarkably quickly
but it takes about four months for them to grow again. In the Spring,
before the mating season, the neck of the male enlarges just around
the junction of the head, his voice changes, and he screams all through
the breeding season. This is his one bad habit. The male Peacock
will mate with several hens.
The Green Peafowl is not considered so hardy as the other varieties.
My opinion is that when thoroughly acclimatized it will be as hardy
as the others.
We find the young Peachicks are much tamer and easier to raise
with a hen (chicken). See that your hen is free from lice and worms,
also that her legs are free from the disease called scaly leg, and that
she comes from a flock of poultry that is free from roupe. This may
appear a large order, but Peachicks, although naturally hardy and
healthy, are subject to poultry ailments.
I am frequently asked for a remedy for roupe and kindred ailments.
Use the axe and burn the body.
All our Peafowl are raised here. Our surplus birds and young
stock run at liberty. Only the breeding birds are confined in pens.
We do not care to sell eggs. There is too much risk in buying eggs ;
if the eggs fail to hatch the seller is blamed.
We pack all birds in light crates and guarantee safe delivery.
Peafowl are long-lived. We have a male in perfect health and
plumage 18 years old, and another we imported from Holland
thirteen years ago. The latter has headed one of our breeding pens
for thirteen years, and is still going strong.
If you need any other information, please ask. We are always
pleased to show our collection of foreign birds, etc., to anyone
interested. If you can advise me when you are coming, I shall be
at home. The male Peafowl is called Peacock ; the female, Peahen;
the baby, Peachick.

British representatives of the family Corvidae have been kept here.
They are all birds which, according to the writer's experience, are
easy to cater for, do extremely well in confinement, and are chiefly
remarkable for their great familiarity, quaint habits, and the readiness
with which they adapt themselves to artificial conditions.
Housing and Requirements Generally .--As a group these birds may be
said to be rather noisy, dirty, and mischievous subjects, too big for
cage life and seen at their best when kept in a roomy outdoor aviary
provided with an open-fronted shelter shed of the usual type. In the
matter of furnishing an aviary intended for the larger species, we find
nothing better as a floor covering than clean sand (this admits of the
fouled portions beneath the perches being renewed daily). As regards
woodwork, etc., taking into consideration the habit that some of the
more formidable species (Raven, Carrion Crow, etc.) acquire of
pulling things to pieces, it is well to have the interior of their aviary
as plain as possible, and the perches plain substantial affairs devoid
of loose bark or useless twigs.
Bathing .--This family of birds are much addicted to bathing, and
as being conducive to their general health, and a sleek appearance,
I would recommend that a large bath of clean water be at all times
left within their reach.
Food .--As to food supply for these birds, though certain species
are largely carnivorous, the majority are omnivorous and require
frequent changes and variety of diet. They are also birds that, like
the true soft-bills, do not eat full meals, and are better with food
continually before them.
As a useful foundation for the Jackdaw, Jays, Magpies, etc., we
have satisfactorily used the insectivorous mixture prepared as for
soft-bills, but considerably let down before the scalding by the addition of
a mixture of one part Crissel to five parts Spratt's chicken meal (biscuit).
As regards extras and dainties, they appear to like nothing better than
table scraps, hemp, sunflower, various nuts, grain, acorns, with an
occasional mouse, mealworm, plucked Sparrow, bird's egg, or piece
of lean meat. For the coarser feeding Raven, etc., nothing in the
shape of table-scraps comes amiss, and although we largely use other
items here (damaged wild rabbit, rats, etc.), I would recommend
scalded dog biscuit as a reserve food, supplemented with such rats,
mice, chicken, and game heads as can be procured.

I 1 6 A. F. MOODY-AN EARLY ACCOUNT OF SOME PERCHING BIRDS
Chough [Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax )
For many years a pair of these pleasing and ornamental birds
were kept here. They proved excellent doers, easy to manage and,
in spite of the fact of their both being perfectly full-winged, confiding
enough to be with safety allowed full liberty. These birds were let
out of their aviary for an hour's exercise almost daily, and were
generally coaxed back at the end of that time, not because there was
any danger of their straying, but because of their tiresome habit of
entering open windows, and the more familiar male's trick of thrusting
his head beneath people's feet or into closing doors, there was a certain
amount of risk in their being at large.
Habits , etc. --As to their behaviour generally--when confined in an
aviary I did not observe that they excelled in either gracefulness of
movement or in activity. When at large, however, it was noticeable
that they possessed an extraordinary amount of wing power and were
wonderfully quick and active. They took a great amount of exercise
which frequently included grand sweeping circles of several hundred
yards in extent ; also, as might be expected, they avoided trees and
settled only upon the ground, upon railings, or high buildings (usually
the chimney stacks of the house).
Food. --Except for mealworms the three examples kept here cared
little for variety, but thrived almost entirely upon Spratt's chicken
meal (biscuit), to which before scalding a sprinkling of Crissel, hemp,
and grocer's currants, had been added.
Breeding. --The female was probably too old to produce eggs, but
annually for some years the pair took possession of a large wooden
box (this was affixed to the wall in the darkest corner of their shed,
was about 2 feet square, and contained a hole in the front large enough
to admit the birds), and built a perfect nest.
The writer has but once seen the Chough in a state of nature, an
occasion when it was curious to hear the very familiar note issuing
from wild birds. It was very pleasing also to note their wonderful
wing power as they circled above the waves of a rock-bound coast.
Nutcracker (Nucifraga caryocatactes)
Several kept. They are birds which, according to the writer's
experience, are usually received from the dealers in a reduced con-
dition. When once established, however, they are absolutely hardy
as regards weather conditions, but prove somewhat less easy to
maintain in health for any number of years than the majority of this
group.
Disposition. --A wild restless species, not taming readily, and usually
evincing a great disinclination to be observed.
Habits , etc. --The Nutcracker in confinement may be said to be
a very active and energetic bird, and being a true forest species our

examples appeared much at home in, and greatly appreciated as
cover and perches, the dead pine trees to which they had access.
These were really stunted over-crowded specimens from the woods,
which after having their lower branches removed, were sawn off
at the required height and fixed upright from floor to roof of the shed.
Breeding. --Accident, escape, and the disease of gapes, a malady to
which the species appears rather prone, prevented us giving them a
fair trial, and I have nothing to record under this heading.
Food. --We gave various nuts, hemp, sunflower, meal, grain, etc.,
with an occasional mealworm or piece of lean meat. I would not
recommend much animal food, although I observed our birds were
very keen on meat, and never missed an opportunity of pouncing
upon, plucking, and devouring any luckless Sparrow that entered
their aviary.
Guatemalan Jay (Xanthoura luxuosa guatimalensis)
We kept for about two years a pair of this very beautiful species.
It is a true Jay possessed of all the amusing qualities of our common
bird, which added to its rich colouring (blue, yellow, green, etc.),
quaint habits, and extraordinary vocal powers make it a most desirable
species to possess.
Sexual Differences. --The supposed female of this pair differed chiefly
from the male by her more feminine behaviour, and in having the
nasal bristles not so erect.
Hardiness. --Appeared to require artificial heat during the winter
months.
Venezuelan Green Jay (.Xanthoura cceruleocephala)
We received with the pair of Guatemalan Jays a female of this
nearly allied species, a bird which appeared to differ chiefly from
that species by having the lower breast and abdominal regions pea
green instead of yellow.
Habits and Requirements. --Similar to those of the Guatemalan Jay.
Both species appeared excellent doers, the three examples referred
to being parted with at the same time and when in the best of con-
dition.
Blue Bearded Jay (Cyanocorax cyanopogon )
A pair kept for some time. It is a species I may describe as rather
Magpie-like in appearance, possessed of extraordinary vocal powers,
quaint habits, and altogether an amusing and easy bird to keep.
Sexual Difference. --Male considerably larger and more brightly
coloured than the female.
Breeding. --The species had no opportunity of nesting.
Hardiness. --As a matter of convenience we provided artificial heat
during the winter months.

Common Jay (Garrulus glandarius)
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.993168804878049" page_id="56288902"  page_num="118" year="" vol="">
Few birds make a more delightful or easily managed pet than a
hand-reared Jay, and I may mention that a male, an old favourite
here and seventeen years old, would in addition to squeezing into the
pocket for dainties, follow one about and, in a most confiding manner,
alight on the head, hand, or shoulder. This bird was also a fair
mimic, his most faithful reproductions being the hoot of a Tawny Owl.
Breeding. --This example was kept more as a pet than for avicultural
study, but during a certain summer when a comparatively wild
female was confined, with him, a typical Jay's nest was built and
young hatched. These I regret to say were not reared owing to the
parents being bullied from the vicinity of the nest by a pair of breeding
Mistle Thrushes. (Their aviary door having been thrown open to
give them a chance of foraging for the young.)
Azure-winged or Spanish Blue Magpie (Cyanopica cyanus cooki )
For about five years until parted with, we possessed two supposed
males of this rather rare species.
It is a bird considerably smaller and more quietly dressed than our
native species, but nevertheless in habits and structure a true Pie.
Breeding. --Judging from the fact that these examples were frequently
seen feeding each other and several times built a perfect nest, I should
imagine a true pair might breed readily in confinement.
Nest. --A rather neat open structure (i.e. not domed). The outer
framework composed of dead beech sticks, the cup of dead grass,
turf, etc., strengthened with a compact lining of short cow's hair.
Hardiness. --Wintered happily without artificial heat when given
the protection of a shut-up sleeping shed.
Magpie [Pica pica)
But an odd specimen or two of this well-known bird accommodated
here. A species which makes a most amusing pet, and is very long
lived and easy to manage.
Food. --Naturally largely carnivorous, or a carrion feeder. Magpies
in this district are ever ready to take a meal from the carcass of a dead
rat, rabbit, etc., and during the winter months in some numbers
haunt the isolated and unsavoury premises of a dealer in fallen cattle.
In confinement exceedingly partial to animal food in the shape of
mice, young rats, fowls' heads, etc.
Breeding. --We have given the common Magpie no opportunity of
nesting in the aviaries here, but I have known a certain pinioned and
very tame male which enjoyed full liberty, pair with and induce
a wild female to assist in the rearing of a brood of young within a few
feet of his owner's house.

A. F. MOODY-AN EARLY ACCOUNT OF SOME PERCHING BIRDS I 1 9
White Jackdaw (Colceus monedula)
Some half-dozen examples of this conspicuous variety kept here.
Being absolutely white they prove interesting birds to possess, but
decidedly more delicate in constitution than the natural bird. It is
but fair to the variety, however, to add that when received from the
dealers these examples had every appearance of having at some time
or other been kept very badly, which may to some extent have
accounted for their lack of stamina.
I understand that the young of this variety originate from a certain
church steeple in Germany.
Carrion Crow (Corvus cor one)
This somewhat uncanny species has not recently been included
in the collection, but from a close acquaintance of hand-reared
examples I may describe the species in confinement as a particularly
cunning, mischievous, and amusing bird ; in fact quite as interesting
and worthy, of being kept as the Raven.
Raven (Corvus corax )
For many years a pair of these handsome, mischievous, and
formidable Crows have been kept here. They are birds that are
much admired for their quaint habits and sleek appearance, and
seem excellently suited as to quarters when kept in an aviary 15 ft.
by 30 ft.
Sexual Differences .--The male differs from the female in voice,
behaviour, and by being generally larger and coarser in build.
Breeding. --This pair have nested and reared young annually for
several seasons since 1904.
Nest. --A huge pile of sticks placed in and upon a large shallow
wicker basket (1 ft. deep by 3 ft. 6 in. across), which had previously
been securely fixed upon a wooden platform or ledge at some feet
from the ground, and beneath the overhanging eaves of their shed.
Eggs. --Five to seven in number--small for the size of the bird, but
similar to such clutches of wild Ravens' eggs as I have had an oppor-
tunity of examining.
Nesting Habits , etc. --Breeding operations usually commence early
in February by the pair carrying bits of stick, rubbish, etc., and as
soon as this is observed, or a week or two later, should the weather
be severe, their basket is fixed in position and an armful or two of
rough sticks (chiefly dead beech) strewn upon the floor. Almost
before one is out of the aviary both birds are busy and the foundation
of the nest begun. They continue building steadily for some days
(the female being the chief architect), until the framework is complete,
after which sticks are declined and the birds look for and are supplied

with dead turf fibre, grass, rootlets, etc. On these items being discarded,
too, the nest is ready for the final lining for which purpose nothing
appears more suitable than short horse or cow's hair (clippings),
failing which the birds will readily supply themselves with material
from a few rabbits' skins.
Incubation .--This is accomplished by the female only, and lasts
from twenty to twenty-three days. The young immediately on
hatching can be heard in the nest. These for the first few days are
attended to by the female, who is most careful to give only tiny
fragments of food which she tears up with the bill and delivers from
the pouch. Up to this stage I have observed the male occasionally
feed the hen only, but as the young become older both parents take
their share, when coarser (larger) fragments of food are pulled up,
and usually moistened or washed before being given to the young.
The latter remain in the nest until about a month old, at which age
they begin to clamber about the sides, but do not cease to return into
the nest at night or venture to the ground until some time later.
(One brood I have a note of took their first flight and finally left the
nest on the thirty-fifth day ; another on the forty-third.)
Food .--Such young Ravens as have been bred here have been
reared entirely upon animal food. (These have never exceeded five
in a brood, as sometimes an egg or two is removed to prevent the
young being too numerous.) They do very well for the first few days
upon freshly killed young wild rabbit, etc., but as they develop a more
nourishing diet (coarser animal food of any kind) appears necessary.
Regarding a food supply for the adults, we give chiefly big rats,
damaged wild rabbit, with an occasional sheep's head ; nothing,
however, in the shape of animal food comes amiss, and I have known
a pair spend a happy week-end with a dead cat.
Bathing .--Reference has been made to the bathing propensities of
the Grows, but without doubt no member of the family that I am
acquainted with bathes so frequently or enjoys a bath more thoroughly
than the Raven. Also that the first thing that a brood of young
Ravens do on leaving the nest (their first descent to the ground) is
invariably to indulge in a good splash. Colour of Raven chick at
six hours old : flesh colour, claws and extremity of bill whitish. Down
smokey, arranged in tufts as follows : a chain or ridge down the back,
upon the hind part of upper wing, a tuft behind each thigh, and a
patch of shorter down at back of head and above each eye. Gape,
pinkish red. Note : a frequently repeated squeaky chirrup. The
above particulars taken from two chicks, 12th April, 1918.
White-backed Piping Crow (Gymnorhina leuconota)
For about three years two examples of this fine Australian species
were kept here. It is a bird about the size of a Rook, conspicuously

dressed in black and white, of handsome appearance generally, but
whose chief attraction lies in its peculiar prolonged and musical bell
or organ-like notes.
Hardiness .--I would recommend the species being slept under cover
during the colder months. These examples, however, being kept
in a large aviary declined to use a shed, and being thoroughly
established, roosted without ill effect the year round in a sheltered
pine tree.
Food .--Sharing an aviary with various Herons, etc., these Piping
Crows had access to their food and thrived almost entirely upon meat.

In the first section, there are, perhaps, not many points calling for special note, but
a very interesting one was discussed in our last issue. We will now pass on to section 2.
Everyone is familiar with the glorious display made by the male Peafowl in the
nesting season. This so-called " tail " of the Peacock is not the true tail, but highly
developed tail covert feathers. When erected, they are supported by the shorter true
tail. The male moults his long train soon after Christmas, in the southern hemisphere,
and immediately commences growing the new one. This attains full splendour by
about the middle of September, and from then on to Christmas the birds are seen
displaying. This, of course, is done for the benefit of the female, but the male bird
is not above displaying to a duck or fowl or even to nothing at all, if the spirit moves
him. Nature has indeed been prodigal with its adornments of the Peacock, but it has
also endowed the bird with the instincts necessary to show it off to the best advantage.
While the feathers are erect, they are periodically vibrated, but this does not visibly
enhance their appearance, and we are left to guess what the function might be. Surely,
the male Peafowl must be the most beautiful bird in the world ! But here we are on
highly controversial ground.
Comparable to the display of the Peafowl are the various performances of the
different species of Pheasants. Some, such as the Peacock Pheasant and the Argus,
will spread their tail in a manner somewhat similar to the Peacock, but the Argus adds
to his display by a peculiar accompaniment. This is a vigorous stamping of his feet
on the ground. Anyone seeing the performance for the first time would be justified
in thinking the bird was having some sort of fit. The Argus is not a highly coloured
bird but in full plumage he is a magnificent sight, measuring upwards of five feet in
overall length. Although perhaps not related to display, in the nesting season, the
Argus has a very characteristic call. This is a long series of notes of varying pitch,

but always to a set pattern. It is a very penetrating sound and persons residing two
miles from the Zoo can often hear it in the stillness of the night.
Two other beautiful Pheasants are the Golden and Lady Amherst. Closely related
and of like build, their feather patterns are somewhat similar but of different colora-
tion. The male of each species displays in an identical manner. This consists of running
a few steps round the hen, then stopping, spreading the " cape " and tail feathers, but
only on the side next to hen and at the same time making a short hissing noise. This
performance goes on ad infinitum , till the hen must become heartily sick of it all. With
Peafowl and all the Pheasants, the hen, by her behaviour, seems to be completely
indifferent to the display made by the cock bird, and it is a matter for speculation as
to just what function the display serves. However, as instinct urges the male to make
the display, it would seem that the hen must notice it, and be capable of judging its
excellence or otherwise. In this way she is guided to select the best mate and thus
anticipate Nature's stern edict, " Survival of the Fittest."
The Australian Mallee Fowl male indulges in a performance which can hardly be
dignified by the word " display ". He bends his neck downwards till his head almost
touches his breast, and in this position emits a low rather weak booming note. The
handsome Bustard (Wild Turkey) makes a display somewhat suggestive of the domestic
Turkey, which is a native of America. The male Bustard inflates a pendulous air sac,
which hangs from his breast, until it almost touches the ground and periodically snaps
his bill shut, which act is followed by a prolonged hiss. At the same time the tail is
held erect. Another Australian bird, the Brush Turkey, does not deliberately display
any of his physical charms although, in the breeding season, the naked skin round his
neck develops into loose folds and becomes highly coloured. As the reader is doubtless
aware, this bird constructs a nesting mound of leaves and sticks, the decomposition
of which creates the necessary warmth for incubation of the eggs which the hen has
deposited. Only the cock bird constructs the mound and it is on this that he is seen
to indulge in an apparently inconsequental act. He will frequently pick up a stick in
his bill and drop it again. It obviously is not done with a view to rearranging the
nesting mound, as this is built by the vigorous backward kicks of the bird when raking
in the necessary material, and finer detail is not studied to the extent of arranging
sticks with the bill. It is mentioned here, however, as it occurs only in the breeding
season and on the nesting mound.
For some years the Zoo was fortunate in having a pair of Lesser Birds of Paradise
and on rare occasions the male was seen to display to the female. This was a lengthy
process, involving extraordinary antics and culminating in the bird hanging up-side-
down with its fine display plumes fluffed out and a fluttering of the wings. Other
Birds of Paradise have different ways of displaying, but from all accounts they must
present a wonderful spectacle.
There are, of course, many more species of birds that display in the nesting season,
but descriptions given must suffice for illustrations of this interesting topic.
Jubilee of the New York Zoological Society
On 8th January, 1946, the New York Zoological Society celebrated its Golden
Anniversary with a memorable meeting and this has been followed by a no less
memorable Jubilee number of Animal Kingdom, the journal of the Society. Profusely
illustrated with no less than eight beautiful colour plates, a large number of excellent
photographs, and with articles of outstanding interest and merit, this number is
certainly a worthy record of the achievements of a great society. The cover itself is
fascinating and consists of an old map of the Zoological Park (1911). Among the
contributors are Fairfield Osborn, William Beebe, William Bridges, and Lee S.
Crandall. A particular interesting article by Donald T. Carlisle entitled " This
is the way we began " has among the illustrations a photograph of the opening
ceremony of the Zoological Park to the public in 1899 an d a reproduction of the
souvenir programme. " Roads to Research," an illuminating account by Leonard
Goss, shows the great progress made by the Society in its medical department.

By J. Delacour
The problem of exhibiting cage birds in public zoos is a difficult
one. Until recently it has been tackled rather crudely. Too often
just rows of wire cages are lined up on shelves. In the better cases
fixed compartments have been neatly built. But practically never
before has it been attempted to show the birds under the best possible
conditions of light, which enables one to detect all the usually elusive
metallic colours and delicate hues ; nor, at the same time, to set them
in an artistic frame. For many years I had planned to build a special
hall, the walls of which would have had glass openings, giving view to
birds and fishes. Cages and aquariums would have been decorated
and planted. The effect would have been that of so many animated,
living pictures. They would be set up in a wide corridor encircling the
hall, where all facilities would be provided for cleaning and for the
care of the creatures.
The centuries-old rooms of Gleres, with all their historic interest,
did not allow for such a scheme. But I had hoped to build a special
house some day in a secluded corner of the park. Fate has decided
otherwise . . . However, I had a chance to achieve at the New York
Zoo for the public what I once had dreamed to do at home for my
own satisfaction. The result has been what we call the " Jewel Room ".
The Bird House in New York consists of three halls, the largest
of which has not been much altered these last years. We have only
redecorated the big central flight and some of the compartments.
The second room has been completely changed in 1942. The numerous
cages and small compartments for Parrots and Doves have been
removed, and five roomy flights have replaced them. They are
decorated and planted so that they now form the " New England
Garden ", for native species ; " Arid Plain ", for desert birds ; " Indo-
Malayan Jungle," for Asiatic species ; " Tropical American Jungle
Stream " and " Tropical American Rain Forest ".

The third hall was particularly unattractive in its former state :
a large room, 60 ft. by 30 ft., with an ugly glass roof and plainly built
compartments all around, each containing a number of small or
medium-sized birds. They were badly lit, and none of the beautiful
colours or metallic reflections of the inmates could be seen at real
advantage. It was the more unfortunate that it always housed a
wonderful collection. This hall has been entirely renovated during
the winter of 1945, and it was reopened as the "Jewel Room" a
little more than a year ago.
The transformation has been comparatively simple and easy--a
smaller room has been built inside the hall, entirely dark but for the
light which comes through the glass front of the cages that open in the
walls ; it all looks like a gallery of live bird pictures, as in my original
plan. Also it reminds one of modern techniques used in aquarium and
terrarium. The hall has two large double doors, one at the end of the
western wall, the other one occupying most of the smaller southern
panel. As a result the cages form two groups, one occupying the
greatest part of the western wall, the other L-shaped, all along the
northern and eastern sides. Those of the first group, ten in number and
of three different sizes, are dedicated to Humming Birds. The others
consist of one large (10 ft. by 11 ft.) unplanted but nicely decorated
aviary mostly for hardbills, of two fair-sized planted compartments
(51 ft. by 5 ft.) and seven smaller ones (3J ft. by 3 ft.). They are at
present occupied by a Fairy Bluebird, a Rothschild's Starling, a
Cock-of-the-Rock, and a number of Manakins, Sugar-birds, and
Small Tanagers, which are doing exceptionally well in such quarters.
They will be ideal for Sunbirds, the smaller Birds of Paradise, such
as Kings, Superbs, and Wilson's, when they are again available. The
large hardbills' aviary and the two adjoining smaller cages are painted
a gay light yellow inside. All the others are pale greyish blue. I am
against backgrounds with painted landscapes or other scenes, as they
are too difficult to keep clean. The cages are strongly and appropriately
lit by natural light from the glass roof, and also from heatless electric
tubes disposed at a favourable angle inside the cages, at the top
of the corner in front, quite invisible to the public. The metallic
reflections of the plumage are thus seen at their best. Troughs are
inserted through the bottom, along the back of the floor, and filled
with tropical plants and flowers. It looks like Gould's plates, but
it is alive.
The public room, on the other hand, is absolutely plain, painted a
dark neutral grey, so that the visitor's attention is not distracted from
the exhibits. We found that in order to give the proper illusion of
adequate space, cages must be very deep (deeper than wide) and
that the back must always be rounded, angles looking very ugly.
Proper ventilation is essential ; and to ensure this holes have to be

pierced at the lower part of the cage, while the top is partly covered
with small mesh wire netting, as used against flies and mosquitoes.
Rather complicated devices had to be conceived for the proper
working of the cages. Mr. Lee Crandall, the General Curator and one
of the most experienced aviculturists I have known, has invented
most of them, with the help of the Head Keeper, G. Scott. For the
cleaning of the Humming Birds' compartments, we place on the
top a bottomless movable cage. A large trap in the top of the compart-
ment slides outwards so that the Hummer can easily fly up into the
movable cage and be confined there while the compartment is cleaned
through the whole back side of the compartment, which can be
opened. After cleaning the Hummer is easily induced to fly down and
re-enter its proper quarters. The larger cages are cleaned through
back doors, without shifting the birds, but the keeper operates by
placing himself inside movable panels, which constitute a portable
cage. If a bird escapes, it cannot go far, and it returns almost
immediately to its compartment.
Birds behind glass cannot be heard, which is a pity, at the least for
the largest number of them. We have remedied that by conducting
the sound from the cages to the public hall by special devices. There
is ample room at the back for spare cages and all sorts of feeding and
cleaning facilities.
The "Jewel Room " has proved a great success. It is, we think,
an excellent show, and the birds are doing exceedingly well in it.
The good effect obtained in the planted cages of the Jewel Room, as
in other sorts of aviaries, depends entirely on two essential conditions :
keeping the cages and the plants themselves meticulously clean, and
also a wise choice of the birds inhabiting them. Species harmless to
the kind of vegetation among which they are meant to live can only
be placed there. Experience helps considerably of course, but without
it, the only thing to do is to try to watch, and to remove, the offenders
as soon as they are caught damaging the plants.

This section is primarily intended for aviculturalists, who wish for
some fairly simple rules to guide them in breeding to produce the
red or black-headed forms of the Gouldian Finch. The whole subject,
including the significance of the proportions between black and red
found in nature, has been treated in more detail in the Journal of
Genetics (1945, pp. 51-7)-
The conclusions which are presented here have been based on records
of crosses found in the literature and upon a special series of breeding
experiments carried out by Mr. P. W. Teague. Great credit is due to
him for his skill and persistence, for with wartime food he had great
difficulties in rearing young birds up to the stage when the colour
of the face mask is ascertainable. His results, however, prove
the mode of inheritance of the head colour beyond any reasonable
doubt.
In studying the inheritance of characters of this kind, it is important
to bear in mind the particulate nature of the processes involved. The
writer may perhaps be pardoned for recapitulating the basic facts,
with which most readers will be already familiar.
The hereditary factors which transmit characters from generation
to generation are born upon minute bodies present in the nucleus
of each cell called chromosomes. Each species of animal has a
characteristic set of chromosomes (specific in number, shape, etc.).
In each of the ordinary body cells there are two sets of these chromo-
somes, and since the hereditary factors controlling this or that character
are situated on the chromosomes, it follows that each separate factor
will be represented twice in any body cell.
Thus in the classical case of Mendel's peas : in those with white
flowers the factors controlling colour are white-producing in both
cases : similarly in red-flowered plants. Obviously, however, in
crossing it is possible to have a plant in which the two sites for colour
on the chromosome pair involved have one a white-producing and
one a red-producing factor. The result is actually a pink flower, but
perhaps the more usual arrangement is for one colour to dominate the
other, so that the colour produced in a plant which has factors for
different colours is not a mixture but either the one or the other.
Thus in the Gouldian Finch the hereditary factor for red-headedness
is dominant to that for black-headedness, and so a " mixed " bird will
appear to be pure red and its mixed nature can only be checked by
breeding.
Let us now substitute some simple symbols and work out what will

happen when a cross is made. Let R = a head colour factor which
produces a red mask and r = one which produces black. The use of
the same letter may seem confusing at first, but it is a useful device
for representing the relation between the two factors and quickly
becomes familiar in use. Since each body cell has a pair of each
chromosome, there will be two colour factors present and these
may be assorted in three ways, RR, Rr, or rr. Birds with the first two
constitutions will be red-headed and birds with the third black-
headed. Let us take two parent birds, mate them, and write them
down thus:--
Parents RR (&amp;lt;?) X rr (#)
It is now that the reason for the presence of two factors for each
character in a body cell is explained, because, when sperms and ova
are being matured in the parents, a cell division takes place which
reduced the number of chromosomes by a half. Hence the fundamental
distinction between " body " cells and " germ " cells. Each sperm
and ovum has only one set of chromosomes and one of each hereditary
factor. This process may be shown as follows :--
Parents RR (&amp;lt;J) x rr (?)
Germ cells R R r r
sperms ova
Now the union of sperm and egg takes place, which restores the
original double set of chromosomes to each developing embryo. In this
particular cross only one type of constitution results in the young
(fertilization being at random between the different kinds of sperms
and ova).
(a) Parents RR (&amp;lt;J) x rO ( 9 )
Germ cells R R r r
Offspring Rr Rr Rr Rr
Each offspring has received one red factor from the father and one
black factor from the mother to make up its factor pair for head colour.
Since R dominates r, the young will all be outwardly red-headed,
though containing a masked black-headed factor, which can be
revealed by breeding. Let us try interbreeding two of these young and
the following scheme will result:--

128 H. N. SOUTHERN-INHERITANCE OF HEAD COLOUR IN GOULDIAN FINCH
This result puts in a nutshell one of the main discoveries of Mendel :
that cross-breeding between two characters (head colour in this case)
only produces an illusion of blending, and if further crosses are carried
out the original colours come out again. This is the result of the
particulate nature of Mendelian inheritance. Apparent blending may
occur when a character is controlled by more than one pair of hereditary
factors, but this complication need not concern us here.
From this situation the curious may discern reasons both for the
constancy and for the variability within a species. An aberrant character
which crops up will be obscured by the dominance to it of the normal
factor in a pair : yet in any wild population it will be possible to
carry a store of recessive variations usually masked, but which can
appear and spread if the environment changes so as to favour the
variant.
Now there is only one further complication to discuss and then the
whole story of the inheritance of head colour in the Gouldian Finch
is made plain. Sex in many animals is determined by a special pair
of chromosomes : in most birds the male has the full complement of
two, but the female only one. By following what happens at maturation
and at fertilization one can see why in the long run broods contain
about as many males as females. When sperms are matured in the
male, each receives one set of chromosomes and consequently one sex
chromosome ; but when ova are matured in the female, one sex
chromosome is missing and therefore ova will be alternately with or
without a sex chromosome. Each sperm that fertilizes an ovum
containing a sex chromosome will produce a young one with two sex
chromosomes, i.e. a male ; each sperm that fertilizes an ovum
lacking a sex chromosome will produce a young one with one sex
chromosome, i.e. a female. Since sperms fertilize the ova at random
the sex ratio of offspring will tend to be equal, i.e. there will be about
as many males as females.
But the sex chromosomes can carry factors for, e.g., head colour just
as well as any other of the chromosomes. The difference here is that
females, having only one sex chromosome, will have one factor for
head colour only in their body cells, and this will exert its effect simply
because there is no other to mask it. This can be put quite simply
and neatly by adjusting the symbols we used above. A male may still
be designated RR, Rr or rr, but a female must be R or r : if we add
O for the missing sex chromosome, a female can be RO or rO, i.e.
either red or black-headed, but there can be no " mixed 15 birds, such
as the red-headed male, Rr.
Now it is a simple matter to work out what happens when Gouldian
Finches are crossed. The following schemes show why red-headed
birds may produce some black-headed offspring, but not vice versa.
Let us begin with the simplest kind of cross.

This cross is quite straightforward : the offspring are invariably the
same as the parents. Such birds constitute what is known to geneticists
as a " pure line 55 as far as head colour is concerned.

This is an interesting result : all the male offspring will be red-
headed, but half will in fact bear the black gene masked like the father,
being what are known as heterozygotes (Rr). Of the females, half
will be red and half will be black. Such ratios of course will only
work out exactly when a large number of offspring is considered.
Small numbers and single broods will show departure from the ratios,
but not of course from the types.

This is a most interesting cross because by itself it gives the whole
key to the method of head colour inheritance. Mr. Teague concentrated
upon this alone throughout all his experiments, since the expected
result is so clear-cut. The young must be of two types only, and those
exactly opposite to the two parents : whereas the father was black,
the sons will be red, and whereas the mother was red, the daughters
will be black.
We may therefore summarize the results of these crosses in the
following way.

Now of the red males in these offspring practically all will bear the
black gene. Thus they appear outwardly red-headed, but will produce
black young among their progeny even if crossed with a red hen.

the male young in 2 (b) will be pure (RR).
Since the aviculturalist is usually most concerned with breeding pure
lines, it is important to be able to determine which red-headed males
are pure or homozygotic (RR) and which are not. There is no trouble
about the black-headed birds because, since black is recessive, all
black males must be pure (rr).
The only way to make this determination, unless the bird is known
to come from cross 2 (a ), is by breeding. This is tedious, but well worth
the trouble, because once the bird's constitution has been established as
RR, it can be crossed with red females and the constitution of the young
is certain to be the same and will not need confirmation by crossing.
The simplest way is to cross the bird to be tested with a black-headed
female until about a dozen offspring have been produced. If the off-
spring are all red, the father will almost certainly be a homozygote
(RR) ; if any of the offspring are black, the father will certainly be a
heterozygote (Rr) and may be discarded as far as breeding a pure
line is concerned.
It is necessary to produce at least a dozen offspring to settle the
matter because of the effect of chance on the ratios. It is possible that
in half a dozen offspring produced from a " mixed " red father and a
black mother, all might be red, just as it is possible to toss a coin and
get heads six times running. However, the more times one tosses the
coin, the less likely is it that the run of heads will be unbroken. There-
fore with a dozen offspring, it is probable that the chance factor has
been minimized. Even if these tests constitute most of the bird's
breeding life, this will not matter because only one subsequent brood
from a red hen is needed. The male offspring from this will be certainly
pure red-heads.
All the figures given on pp. 127-130 for offspring are of course ratios
and will only be fulfilled when a large enough number of young has
been bred to minimize the chance factor. The ratios, as e.g. in 2 (b)
where the young will be in the ratio of 3 red : 1 black, represent the
probability of the kind of young produced, just as 1 head : 1 tail
represents the probable result of tossing a coin.
Finally a word must be said about these pure line red males. In
the wild state black birds are three times as common as red, and of the
red males only a very small percentage will be pure. Therefore in a
casual stock it is little use testing each red male because it might be a
very long job before a pure one was discovered.
Pure red males must therefore be bred for. The best cross to obtain
these is 2 (b). From a " mixed " red male and a red female, half the
male offspring may be expected to be pure. Therefore from a number
of young from cross 2 ( b ) it should not be long before a breeder finds
a bird of the required qualities.

This assumes that such birds are equally hardy to the " mixed 33 red
males. If they are not (and Mr. Teague tells me that there is some
evidence for this) it may be necessary to persevere until some are
ultimately reared and a pure line established.
Naturally the above remarks about testing and breeding for pure
line red males apply equally when an allegedly pure red male is
purchased. The breeding register should be inspected and previous
crosses and parentage examined in the light of the information given
here.

So many aviculturists are interested in the beautiful Gouldian
Finch that the Editor has assured me that further details of my own
experiences with this Finch would be welcomed by readers of this
Magazine.
This time I can record a little more knowledge gained about these
lovely birds, which I am pleased to pass on for the benefit of others.
I am sure all Aviculturists will be grateful to Mr. H. N. Southern, of
Oxford University Museum, for his excellent and lucid article,
especially written for our readers on the genetics of the Gouldian
Finch. After long and exhaustive research, Mr. Southern has not only
given us the formula to produce a pure line of the much sought after
red-headed variety, but many other interesting factors for study and
application.
Personally I cannot claim any knowledge of the scientific study of
genetics, but I have been privileged to carry out certain crosses with
Gouldian Finches under the expert guidance of Mr. Southern, coupled
with some good luck in breeding and rearing young to maturity, so
that their identification was beyond dispute. The breeding was a
somewhat slow undertaking, because one has to wait such a long
time for results, and it was carried out at a time when the seed shortage
was most acute.
Unfortunately Gouldians will not live long on substitute foods.
So serious was the death rate (thirty-five one year) from unsuitable
food, starvation, bomb-blast, Hawks, and Owls, that I had the gravest
fears of even saving any of my precious birds, and I commenced my
task under the further handicap of a much depleted stock and with
very little seed.
Just to instance one of my breeding disappointments which would

have been a complete failure only for the priceless foster parents, the
Bengalese. One irreplaceable red-headed hen laid six nests of eggs,
five or six eggs each nest, sat each nest from four to seven days, then
left them. She then had a seventh nest of seven eggs, sat well, and
hatched six young. These babies were all thrown out of the nest when
two or three days old, unfortunately all were quite dead when I
discovered them on the floor. From some of the eggs placed under the
Bengalese they have reared nine young healthy Gouldians. This hen
had all these nests in fairly quick succession and laid at least forty
eggs; very few appeared unfertile. Probably more would have been
hatched and reared but for the fact that the weather was very cold
at the time and I hadn't sufficient pairs of Bengalese to sit them, or
I may have reared more. I can hear some of the wise-heads saying,
" This hen was overstimulated," but I should like to find the stimulant
in the very scanty war-time diet on which these birds have existed.
Apart from the above and other breeding disappointments, there was
always the perpetual headache--how to keep the young alive from
eight to eighteen months (sometimes longer) that must elapse from
the time they leave the nest until adult feathers become discernible
to prove identification.
Had it not been for the untiring efforts of Miss Barclay-Smith to
obtain seed and the regular dispatch of small parcels of the precious
stuff by Mr. Jean Delacour, New York, it is indeed very doubtful
if these results could have been obtained in England for many years
to come, as the breeding stock would have all died. As an enthusiastic
breeder of Gouldian Finches, my grateful thanks are due to Miss
Barclay-Smith, Mr. J. Delacour, Major M. S. Aldham, Mr. V. P.
Knight, of Durban, Miss M. Wright, of Johannesburg, and the New
Zealand Avicultural Society, for their practical assistance with small
parcels of seed.
It should not be overlooked that Gouldian Finches are not the
easiest of foreigners to acclimatize, and I think I hold a unique record
having bred and maintained these Finches in England for the last
twenty years.
During this long period stamina and fertility have been maintained
as well as the brilliant colours. The only break in colour, if it can
be termed a break, was the appearance of one yellow-headed cock
which unfortunately died just before attaining its full adult plumage.
I also had an almost yellow-headed hen appear, which I lost through
egg-binding trouble. This skin has been preserved. These two were
bred from red-heads. Apart from these I am thankful to say there has
been no break in the colours of the Gouldians, even after so many
generations of English-bred stock and some twenty years of confined
breeding. Personally I hope there never will be, otherwise this beautiful
Finch will cease to be the Gouldian as we know it.

134 p - w - TEAGUE-FURTHER NOTES ON BREEDING OF GOULDIAN FINCHES
The results from all black-headed matings and the scores of young
reared has never produced anything but pure black-heads, whereas
the red-headed phase usually produced both black and red-heads.
The establishing of a pure red-headed line of Gouldians was a very
difficult proposition, slow, tedious, and full of disappointments. Apart
from the usual forsaken nests, or parents throwing young out of the
nests and other casualties, there is the long wait of eight to eighteen
months for these youngsters to come into adult plumage, and then
one often finds careful matings have all gone wrong again and have
again produced the usual mixed bag of red and black-headed
youngsters. This sort of thing went on for years until I was beginning
to think a pure line of red-heads could not be established. However
I persevered, and in 1934 I paid a heavy price (for those days) for a
newly imported red-headed hen from Australia. This hen seemed to
change all my luck for breeding red-heads. I mated her to one of my
own red-headed males which I had been carefully selecting and
breeding for some years. This pair produced and reared twelve
youngsters that season, all of which moulted out red-heads. Unfor-
tunately I got no more from this hen, for she died in the moult early
in 1935. This pair undoubtedly laid the foundation for my line of
pure red-heads. Although I have now bred seven generations of these
pure red-heads, that imported hen left her mark on all the hens, for
even her direct descendants to-day have the same expression and looks.
Mr. Southern's research and article now explains how I came to hit
on a pure line of red-headed Gouldians.
Here I should like to give a word of warning about the much sought
after red-headed variety. It has one very serious drawback, and that
is, it is subject to a kind of vertigo, characterized by the twisting of the
head, causing the bird to fall from the perches, and it is unable to
judge distances, but do not let this small drawback deter you from
breeding redheads, for all birds are subject to far more deadly
ailments. I have seen this trouble in freshly imported red-heads,
so that it cannot be due to confined breeding conditions. Perhaps it
is one of nature's peculiarities to keep certain species or varieties
limited. I have never seen or had a case of vertigo amongst the black-
headed phase. This is rather an interesting point, and may some day
throw some light on the disparity between the numbers of red and
black-headed phases in their natural surroundings. So far I have
found no cure.
Whilst on this topic of breeding Gouldians I think it worth recording
that I have had several birds that have lived to nine years and over.
Two pairs put up rather an outstanding record. One was a pair of
imported black-heads, which I purchased in full adult plumage in
1926. This pair hatched and reared young every year for nine years
until they died in 1935. It was this pair that bred my famous pet

Gouldian " Phillip " who was known all over England and about
whom I hope to write a few separate notes. Phillip was thirteen years
old when he died. The second pair were red-heads of my own breeding.
This pair hatched and reared five young when in their ninth year, in
spite of the fact that the old hen had completely lost one eye. They
both died during the severe winter of 1940-1.
In conclusion all Gouldian breeders, I feel sure, will be grateful to
Mr. Southern for producing the formula whereby we may breed one
of the most beautiful birds living, a line or stud of pure red-heads, and
I should like to express my gratitude to those who helped with seed,
otherwise a unique record and stud of Gouldians would have been
lost and with it a contribution of knowledge to science.

Here is a subject very repellent at first sight to persons of taste and
good feeling. The man who would imprison our sister Swallows must
be capable, it would seem, of keeping pinioned angels in a paddock
or water-babies in a fish-pond ; but there will be nothing here to
pain the sensitive or enrage the humanitarian, for it is a simple story
with a happy ending, and begins, like Alice in Wonderland, with
a rabbit. This rabbit some years ago went prospecting in a gorse-
patch not far from my house, and in the course of his investigations
made sundry small borings from which he threw out little packets of
white sand and departed. Time passed and presently a knowledgeable
fellow going that way observed that this sand had all the special
qualities that make it useful to man and advised me to open a pit
there. This was done, and by degrees the quarry grew deeper, till
one spring a number of Sand Martins, noticing that its walls were
untenanted, decided--without, unfortunately, consulting the rabbit--
that it was the very place for a building estate. They lacked, poor
innocents, the uncanny powers of the unholy rat, which, by some
obscure trafficking with the devil, has acquired, or so they say, fore-
knowledge of floods, shipwrecks, volcanic eruptions, and other
disasters. They did not even notice, or perhaps observed with pleasure,
a little spring which bubbled out at the foot of the sandy wall they
proposed to excavate. Time passed again, but two or three years
later, one day in June, there was a sudden rumble, and down came
the wall, down came the cradles and babies and all. Out of the
debris I rescued two callow youngsters which still breathed and
carried them home. To rear them, mainly on ant-eggs and mealworms,

was no difficult business, and as soon as they could fly they were placed,
during the day, in a large aviary. At dusk I picked them up and put
them in a cardboard box which was shut in a cupboard in my bed-
room. About seven o'clock D.S.T. each morning they started to
scuffle about and were then released. First they flew round and round
for some minutes, then settled on the foot of my bed, and sat there
murmuring sweet nothings to each other or watching me with their
friendly eyes until I had breakfasted and dressed. They were then
replaced in their box and carried off to their aviary. Like other
creatures they seemed to love this regularity of punctual routine.
It may give them a dim sense that they live in a safe and orderly
world where everything goes according to plan, or perhaps they enjoy
the recognition of familiar and expected events, or possibly again
they may, like man, love routine because it saves the fatigue and
worry of deciding what to do next. All went well for a while, but
trouble is always just round the corner waiting for the slightest slip
of all but the most impeccably careful of bird-keepers. One evening,
returning with the birds in their box, I stumbled and let it fall. One
of them flew out in alarm and in a moment was off at top speed
into the sunset. It was high ground and I watched it until far away
and beyond sight. Dusk came on but there was still good hope, for
the fact that it could not feed itself, and the homing instinct of the
Swallow tribe, made it quite probable that it would return in the
morning. Early next day I was at the aviary and waited, but the
hours passed and nothing happened. By evening all hope was lost
and when next morning there was still no sign, its death appeared
as certain as if the corpse lay before my eyes. Yet I was destined to
recover my bird alive and well, though it flew into no open window
and was caught by no friendly neighbour ; nor was I wrong in
believing that it could not possibly feed itself.
A day or two later I was passing by a high shed about 30 yards
from the aviary. It has a thatched roof in which the previous year
a pair of Starlings had made a hole near the top and raised a family.
This spring a couple of Robins had taken possession, though it was
an unusually high site for them, and suddenly it occurred to me
to pay them a visit. A ladder was fetched and with some difficulty
I got on the roof and reached the nest. In it were four well-fledged
Robins, which cowered down, and in the middle of them was the
Sand Martin greeting me with every sign of pleasure. Evidently
it had returned at dawn, and flying vainly round had spied the Robin's
hole, which might well rouse ancestral memories of holes as home. No
doubt the Robins were out foraging, but even so it is marvellous
that birds of so jealous a disposition should have at once adopted
a stranger of adult appearance and totally different in form and
colour.

We may almost be converted to the view that popular notions
about the virtue and benevolence of Robins may, after all, be not
entirely untrue. It would have been interesting to keep this odd
family together, and watch their behaviour when they left the nest,
but I was too astonished and delighted to think of anything at the
moment except seizing my bird, scrambling down from the roof,
and getting back to the aviary.
About a week after this adventure they began to feed themselves,
at first rather unwillingly, and were then trained to fly to me from
some distance outside their aviary. Soon they enjoyed their liberty
and sometimes rose up and joined the wild Sand Martins that were
circling overhead, but I had only to stretch out my hand and down
they swooped to me from the sky. Compared with this it is a dull
affair to keep a bird in a cage where it becomes contented only because
some of its natural instincts have withered away and it has lost all
desire to use its weakened wings.
A month or more now went by without incident, but often my
mind would revert to the singular affair of the Robins. Why should
I have thought at that moment of doing something which I had
previously considered as not at all worth while ? For weeks I had
known of that nest and never wished to go up to it. However, when
one is faced by a strange incident it is necessary to accept the least
unlikely explanation, and since coincidence has a very long arm it is
perilous to attach too much importance to a single instance, however
remarkable. Yet one cannot quite exclude the possibility of a more
romantic solution. I was talking to someone when I arrived at the
shed and the bird, knowing my voice, may well have uttered a cry
which I heard unconsciously. Moreover, we do not know how animals
communicate with each other and are almost equally ignorant about
the faculties of our own subconscious mind, the region of our ancestral
fears and worships, of our attractions and aversions, and our oldest
means of communication.
I have myself a friend who is deaf and dumb ; yet there is between
us just as much " understanding " and mutual confidence as if we
could talk together, and a strong sense of communication at all
times when we meet, or go together for a stroll. It is an exchange of
thought and feelings below the level of consciousness, and we only
know that it takes place by the mutual sense of intimacy that ensues.
Possibly we may communicate in the same way with animals, within
the limits of their very primitive natures, and have a whole unknown
world in common. A degree of telepathy seems to exist continuously
among many gregarious creatures. I have watched for long, in the
clear waters of the Lake of Geneva, great shoals of silvery smelt-like
fish which are, I think, peculiar to the Swiss Lakes. These fish move
like a single organism, round and round, up to the top, down to the

bottom, and back again. It is not a case of 44 When father says 4 turn '
we all turn " : there is no leader. On the contrary, one might shoot
a yard ahead, followed by a small group, but a moment later the whole
shoal, like a single big fish, changes direction, and at once the
deviationists bury themselves anew in the totalitarian mass. Some-
thing similar may be observed in flocks of Starlings and other birds,
for the whole crowd will often rise from a field, though not alarmed,
at the same instant.
It may be objected that animals and birds, however much attached
to us they may be, are too undeveloped for any such communication
to be possible, that they have no 44 souls ", no free will, and are purely
automatic. It has, of course, been shown by experiment that animals
have next to no powers of reason, but it does not follow that their
moral development is at exactly the same level. This we cannot
measure except by those intuitions and perceptions which in some
degree give us an insight into the moral personality of any stranger
who addresses us for the first time, even before we have any other
means of forming an estimate. We should hardly receive the sudden
impression that this is a good fellow, or perhaps that he is a zealous
grinder of his private axe, if our interest were concentrated only on
learning whether he has shrimps with his tea or pickles with his supper.
The training of a man of science tends to deprive him of this faculty
of insight. Darwin in his old age complained in a letter to a friend
that all the pleasure he found formerly in art and music, in poetry,
and even in the beauty of nature, had gradually faded away. Every-
thing, of course, has its price. A poet may not be a very accurate
observer, and Wordsworth writes of the Cuckoo 44 singing in the
Hebrides ", but he will have a truer sense of the link that binds us
to other forms of life, and will incline to agree with the Buddhist that--
4 4 To him who wisely sees
The Brahmin with his scrolls and sanctities,
The cow, the elephant, the unclean dog,
The outcaste gorging dog's meat, all are one."
Even the small child with his bow-wow and his dicky bird is possibly
better equipped; for like the poet, he regards his pets not as objects
of study but as fellow mortals, and probably feels a puppy to be a
more natural friend and companion than any crotchetty old man or
woman. It is worth recalling an incident long past, but unforgettable,
which may cause the sceptic to hesitate and to be a little sceptical,
as every true sceptic must be, about his own scepticism.
In my father's garden there was a great extent of evergreen shrubs,
and one spring about the beginning of the century I had found in it
some twenty-four Thrushes nests and a couple of Blackbirds'. (There
were at that period many more Thrushes and less Blackbirds than of

recent years.) One night the district was invaded by a very great
storm of wind and rain which lasted many hours, and when in the
morning I went round to see the damage, all the nests had been over-
whelmed. All those with eggs were deserted, and all those with
young ones . . . except for two. On these two nests I found the mothers
still sitting, cold and dead, upon their dead young ones. The man of
science may see in this nothing but the displacement of the instinct
of self-preservation by the maternal instinct for the preservation of
the race. There was no choice, no moral value ; only automatic
reaction. There are those of course who will deny freewill to man also,
and consider him equally as an automaton--though bird-keepers live
too close to nature to be likely disciples for the philosophy of despair.
Yet the soldier who stands in the breach when all his companions
have fallen, does not choose. His forbears were brave and he has
always been brave. He too acts on instinct, the prisoner of his past.
There he stands, and " can no other Shall we then allow no
smallest atom of credit to those poor birds which stayed and suffered
and died while others fled ? Is it not probable that just as we find in
very low forms of life the first traces of a nervous or other physical
system, we shall find also at a stage at least far lower than the human
the beginnings of a moral consciousness, the first traces of a feeling
of oughtness and disinterested love ?
Certainly no animal can think " I ought ", for he cannot stand
outside himself or realize himself as existing, but it is possible for the
higher animals to have a feeling of " oughtness ", and anyone who
denies this has never troubled to study his own dog.
We may also consider the brave mother Partridge drawing off, at
her peril, all enemies approaching her young. Is her play-acting
purely mechanical, or is it another proof that " les grandes pensees
viennent du coeur " ?
It has been observed that among rather defective and retarded
human beings are sometimes found characters of rare and selfless
beauty as though the heart were attempting pathetically to com-
pensate for the weakness of the brain and, if it is excusable to recall
another apposite tag, I will remind those who endured the classics
at school of Cicero's remark (a handy missile against preaching elders) :
" Boni nescio quomodo tardiores sunt." " Somehow or other good
people are apt to be rather stupid." The same view is held to-day,
and most of us know those ribald verses which begin : "If only the
good were the clever, if only the clever were good," and end, " But
the good are so harsh to the clever, and the clever so rude to the good."
Man, with some success, tried to be clever, and the animals, or most
of them, try to be good. They have, at any rate, an immense capacity
for love, which, after all, is the gist of the matter. Fabre, in his charming
book on insects, remarks that his beetles give their lives for their young,

but have no virtue since their act is mechanical. Of course it is at
that low level, but we are concerned with birds and beasts. If they
give their body to be burned, and " have not charity ", they are
nothing, but if they make a family habit of giving their body to be
burned for a thousand thousand generations charity will sooner or
later enter in. A " noble " act repeated indefinitely must tend to
acquire a moral content, to become tinted with the first faint hues of
disinterested love. Whether a process takes ten years or ten million
years matters not at all : we seek for a law and are satisfied whenever
we find some reason to believe that we live in a universe that has
some meaning and purpose. Such matters being much too high for
the present writer he will merely state his conviction that the lower
creatures are more closely akin to us than has been allowed either
by the learned or the devout. As to the former, only two hundred
years ago many of them averred that all inheritance derived from
the male, and that it mattered no more what woman a man married
than in what field he planted his corn ; while at an earlier date some
eminent divines opined that women have no souls. We may therefore
venture a little to think for ourselves, and though no sensible man
would contradict a conchologist or bandy words with a professor
of philology, when it comes to the " science " of the mind and soul
we may consider that the authorities have handed out to us a number
of notions, some very valuable and true, no doubt, but some which
time again will render ridiculous. The devout are dogmatic. " We
must accept," says a famous theologian, " the theory of Evolution.
We cannot tell at what stage in his development man became possessed
of a soul. All we know is that at some moment in time God breathed
a soul into him." Like a timid mariner this divine sets sail reluctantly
from the land of Genesis, but must keep the shore in sight and allow
to man his special act of creation. The non-churchman may think
that this savours rather of magic and the Arabian Nights , and that
there is no less piety in the conception of moral beauty slowly unfolding
in accordance with immutable laws ; or he may borrow the phrase of
the theologian and say that, perhaps, as physical life, with an unceasing
urge, invades every nook and cranny of this earth from the Sahara to
the Poles, and from mountain tops to the black depths of the sea, so
spiritual life is breathed into every living thing as it becomes, in the
faintest degree capable, of receiving it.
" Gentle reader," as they used to say, with a pleasing naivete,
if these heathenish or heretical speculations have bored thee stiff--
as it is highly probable---of thy courtesy excuse them, for they are

but if thou hast skipped the whole I forgive thee freely, and hasten
on to that happy ending which was promised at the outset.

It was late in August and a fine sunny day, so that I did not trouble
overmuch on noticing that half a gale was blowing from the west.
I released my birds and they rose high as they loved to do ; but in
a few minutes they were in trouble, struggling against a wind too
strong for wings so little used to long sustained endeavours. It was
clear that they were trying to return and could not ; tacking this
way and that, gaining a little only to lose more. I stood holding out
my hands like one of those sad Virgilian ghosts on the wrong side of
the River Styx, but all in vain, for soon they gave up the struggle
and were off down wind and away. It was the right time of year
and no doubt they soon headed for the south to join other small
pilgrims of the sun. A week or two of freedom would give all the
strength they needed for the journey, and now when winter has come,
and a cage in the kitchen would have been their home, I think they
are better where they are ; happy sparks of spirit whirling up into the
skies above the hot sands of farthest Africa.

THE CEYLON MAGPIE
(Cissa ornata (Wagler))

W. G. Osman Hill, M.D., F.Z.S.
One of the most desirable birds that an ambitious aviculturist could
acquire in Ceylon is the Blue Magpie (Cissa ornata ). A species
indigenous to the island, it belongs to a genus comprising some four
species, the others being widely dispersed over tropical Asia.
The Ceylonese bird is very distinct, but is unfortunately not common.
Where found it is not exactly rare, but it is very local in its distribution,
shy in habit, and keeps to heavy forest in the central hilly parts of the
island. It generally moves about in small parties of anything up to
a dozen.
During a residence of almost fifteen years in the island, I was not
fortunate enough to secure a specimen for my aviaries ; in fact, I
never saw a live one. I heard from various friends of localities where
they were to be found and made several expeditions in search of them
without success. One time it was Hanguranketa, beyond Kandy ;
another it was Kitulgalla, at the foot of the Ginigathena Pass that
gives access to the higher plateaux of the central mountain mass. But
it was always the same--the birds had moved on.
Judging from other Cissas, the Ceylon bird should do well in
captivity. It is omnivorous and behaves in general much like any
ordinary Magpie. A few months before I left the island, I heard from
Mr. Dillon Ripley, who was then stationed there, that he had seen a

captive bird in the possession of Mr. G. M. Henry. It was newly
acquired and minus a tail, but doing well, promising to make an
attractive exhibit after its moult. I have heard no further news of
this individual, but feel confident that, in Henry's experienced hands,
it would prove a charming, hardy and long-lived inmate of his
collection. It is to be hoped that he will in due course record his
experiences.
Guriously enough, three months before I left Ceylon, a freshly dead
specimen of Cissa ornata came into my hands. An old pupil of mine,
Dr. R. Anthonisz, had informed me that the bird he suspected to be
the one I wanted was to be found in the Ampana Hills, just beyond
Kitulgalla. He had described it to the villagers, who recognized it as
what they knew as the pankairassa --a vernacular name quite different
from the one recorded by Wait (1931), who gives the Sinhalese epithet
as kehibella. Apparently the bird nested in this locality, building a
rough nest much like a crow's, high up in tall trees : the breeding
season being stated to be during the north-east monsoon (i.e. between
November and February). The first bird obtained proved to be a
Red-faced Malkoha (Phcenicophas pyrrhocephalus )--another indigene,
which, though welcome as a specimen, was not quite what I wanted.
However, in September, 1944, a Cissa arrived, though unfortunately
dead. It is from this that my first-hand acquaintance with the bird
is derived.
Not having been long dead, the specimen retained all its original
beauty of plumage, as well as the intense coloration of the naked
parts. As shown in the accompanying sketch, the head is shaped
much like that of any other Corvine bird. The long plume-like feathers
of the head and the large naked area surrounding the eye and ear
regions are noteworthy. That around the eye is coterminous with the
eyelids and terminates peripherally in a frilled edge all round. This

area is of brilliant scarlet hue. The frills project 2 mm. beyond the
general skin-surface. The frills or flaps, especially those related to the
upper lid, project sufficiently to mask the eyelid proper. There are
about a dozen projections to each lid. A few short brownish feathers
arranged in a row occur along the upper edge of the naked area.
Traced towards the scalp, the scarlet tinge fades gradually to orange.
Orange also prevails posteriorly and inferiorly, becoming deeper
around the ear-opening. There is also a median orange streak on the
belly for 1J in. anterior to the cloacal margin. These transient features
appear to have escaped record hitherto.
The large, robust bill is coral-red and has the large, oval nostrils,
opening forwards, situated near its base and partially overlapped by
the most anterior feathers of the loreal region.
The iris is chestnut (Wait says " light brown ", possibly based upon
examination of an immature bird).
The legs and feet are also coral-red, but the plantar surface is paler
than the rest. The claws are brownish dorsally, paler on the sides and
dirty yellow beneath.
The plumage is quite well known, but to make this account complete
the following brief resume may be added. Head, upper back, and
upper breast glossy chestnut ; the rest of the body plumage bright
blue, becoming lighter--almost sky-blue--on the lower back. Wings
with coverts shading gradually from the chestnut of the back into dull
brown, faintly washed with blue on the primary coverts. Flight
feathers with chestnut outer webs and blackish-brown inner webs,
but inner webs of tertiaries deep blue. Thighs dusky brown, washed
with blue. Tail, long as in the European Magpie, but deep blue, with
white tips to the feathers and white edges on the most lateral rectrices.
Between the white tips and the blue is a more or less irregular patch
of black. Young birds are said to have shorter tails than the adults and
also to differ in their paler general hue.
I am glad to be able to report that I have given a few tips to
Mr. Frost as to the whereabouts and habits of Cissa ornata , and that
he proposes to obtain specimens of one of the mainland species and
use these as decoys for the Ceylon birds. It is to be hoped that he will
succeed and that British aviaries will soon be graced with this most
desirable Oriental Magpie.

The past year's results, whilst not as good as those of the preceding
season, have, generally speaking, been reasonably satisfactory,
especially as three species of Australian Parrakeets were successfully
reared for the first time in my collection. My absence from Adelaide
from early in April until mid-November once more placed a heavy
burden on the ever-willing shoulders of my friend Mr. H. Manfield,
who, with the help of his two elder sons, once again took over the
time-consuming task of caring for my collection. The statistics show
that thirty-four species of Australian Parrakeets were represented in
the collection during the year ; of these twenty-seven were given
breeding facilities with the following results. Twenty-two of the
twenty-seven species produced eggs and two other species evinced
considerable interest in their nests without actually laying. Of the
species that laid only sixteen hatched young, and of these only one
failed to rear their progeny, the number of species reared (fifteen)
being one less than in the previous year. Fifty-four young actually
left the nests, being 69 per cent of the total number (seventy-one)

1. Cockatiel (Leptolophus hollandicus ).--The old pair shared one
of my largest aviaries with three of their young of the previous season
and a pair of Crimson-wings. The two hens appropriated a large

<bodyText confidence="0.924977722222222" page_id="56288934"  page_num="144" year="" vol="">
log intended for the latter and laid eleven eggs in it. These were
mostly spoilt by the competition which went on as to which of the
five was to incubate, but one young actually hatched late in November,
but was deserted. On removal of the young birds a second clutch of
five eggs was laid late in November ; three of these proved clear,
but the others hatched in mid-December, and both young left the
nest on 8th January, somewhat plucked about the head and neck
but otherwise good specimens.
2. Barraband Parrakeet (Polytelis swainsoni ).-- I had despaired
of ever breeding from this pair, which have been in my collection
since 1939 without ever previously laying. However, this year a clutch
of five eggs was laid in mid-October, and young were heard on
10th November and five were counted on the 19th. The first two left
the nest rather prematurely on 13th December when the temperature
was well over the century. The following day, which was just as hot,
a third youngster was out on the ground and the remaining two,
practically fully feathered, were found dead in the log. The third
young was dead the next day, but the first two survived and are,

3. Rock Pebbler Parrakeet (P. anthopeplus) .--This pair repeated
their success of the previous season, a clutch of five eggs being laid
late in September. All hatched, but two died when quite big, the
remaining three left the nest on 25th and 26th November, and as
two of them are brighter than the third I think they are probably
two cocks and a hen. Last year's young are still in my possession,
and have turned out to be two cocks ; they had attained their full
adult plumage when fourteen months old.

unsuccessful seasons a new cock was obtained in the early spring.
He proved very attentive to his mate, who thereupon proceeded to
lay several soft-shelled eggs ! Early in December she laid another
soft-shelled one, followed by a normal one which she incubated
assiduously, but it proved clear and was removed. I hope to try a
new hen in the forthcoming season as the present one has only
succeeded on one occasion.

5. King Parrakeet (. Aprosmictus cyanopygius) .--This pair shared
one of my largest aviaries with a pair of Swifts and a few other odd
birds, but showed no sign of coming into breeding condition. I recently
inspected a pair of this species, the cock of which still showed no sign
of coming into adult plumage, which had successfully reared young
during the past year ; I do not think breeding by an uncoloured
cock has ever previously been recorded.
6. Crimson-winged Parrakeet (A. erythropterus) .--As previously
mentioned, this pair shared an aviary with cockatiels and did not get
a fair chance.
7. Crimson Rosella (Pennant's) ( Platycercus elegans). --Not segre-
gated. The cock was killed in a fight with other Broadtails in the
spring and has not been replaced as yet.
8. Adelaide Rosella (P. adelaida). --Represented by an adult
pair, but not segregated.

a disappointing series of misfortunes. The first egg of a clutch of
five was laid on 18th August, but the eggs were spoilt owing to the

on 21 st September, but the log again proved faulty and the eggs were
again spoilt. A new log was then supplied and the third clutch was

commenced on 31st October and consisted of six eggs. One young
was seen on 29th November and another the next day. In all four
hatched, but one had died by 6 th December. The remaining three
flourished until some very hot weather was experienced at Christmas
time, when they all succumbed ; they were within a week of leaving
the nest.
12. Northern Rosella (Brown's) (P. venustus). --The cock of
this pair, acquired in March, 1945, has lost most of his toes from
fighting, and they have a depressingly long record of infertile eggs.
This year a clutch of four was laid in May, but once again proved
clear. I doubt whether fertile eggs will ever be produced in view of
the cock's disability.
13. Eastern Rosella (P. eximius). --Represented only by a cock
of the golden-mantled variety until December when a young hen of
the common subspecies was secured. Not segregated.
14. Western Rosella (Stanley) (P. icterotis). --The old cock was
segregated with one of his progeny of the previous year, but as this
turned out to be a young cock it is not surprising that the results
were disappointing ! A hen was obtained in December, too late to
expect results.

<bodyText confidence="0.974027047619048" page_id="56288936"  page_num="146" year="" vol="">
consisted of three eggs, laid early in September. One of these was
infertile, but the other two had hatched by 27th September and were
both reared, being two hens. The first egg of the second clutch of
three was laid on 14th November. This time only one egg was fertile
and it had failed to hatch when the hen ceased incubating on
11 th December.
17. Port Lincoln Ringnegk (Bauer's) ( B . zonarius).--- An
unexplained failure following last year's success. The first egg of
the first clutch of six was laid on 10th September and all the eggs
had disappeared by 10th October. The second clutch was started on
13th October and again consisted of six ; once again all the eggs
disappeared.
18. Twenty-eight Ringneck (Yellow-naped) [B. semitorquatus ).--
Although I had had my present hen of this species since 1937 she
had never laid, though she often appeared interested in logs. She was
provided with a new mate in 1944 without result. This year a clutch
of four was commenced on 25th October and three young were seen
on 26th November. These flourished and the first two left the log
on 2nd January, the third, which was much smaller all along, left,
improperly fledged, on 5th January. As it was not fed by its parents
during that day, an attempt was made to hand rear it, but without

success. The two elder young thrived and are fine specimens ; they, like
their parents, have no trace of yellow on the abdomen and are both hens.
This is the first recorded breeding of this species in South Australia,
and I have now succeeded in breeding all four members of this
genus for the first time in this State.
19. Pileated Parrakeet ( Purpweicephalus spurius). --The hen laid
three eggs from the perch towards the end of October ; I still have
hopes that she may eventually settle down and breed.
20. Red-vented Blue Bonnet ( Psephotus hamatorrhous) .--This pair
repeated their success of the previous year, three eggs being laid at
the end of August. One was infertile, the other two hatched and were
reared, proving two cocks.
21. Yellow-vented Blue Bonnet ( Ps. xanthorrhous) .--The cock
died in October, just as the hen was beginning to evince some interest
in the log.
22. Little Blue Bonnet (Naretha) (Ps. naretha). --Following last
year's infertile eggs, I succeeded in getting hold of a new cock during
the winter. A clutch of five eggs was commenced on 6th October and
three hatched, the remaning two being clear. Two of the young soon
died, but the survivor, a cock, flourished and left the nest on nth
December. An unmated hen in my possession also laid three eggs and
incubated steadily. This is the first breeding record for South Australia,
apart from the success at the Zoo in 1941.
23. Hooded Parrakeet (Ps. dissimilis). --The first clutch of five
eggs was commenced on 10th August and three young were seen on
nth September, the other two eggs being clear. The first young left
the log on 6th October and the other two three days later ; they were
two cocks and a hen. A second clutch of six was laid late in October,
but unfortunately the ring on the hen's leg somehow became crushed
and she deserted. She eventually lost her foot and I am wondering
whether she will be of any value as a breeder in the future. I have
seen the statement made that a one-legged cock is invariably useless,
but have been considerably heartened by learning of a one-legged
hen Scarlet-chested that is a regular breeder.
24. Many-coloured Parrakeet (Ps. varius).- --The past year saw
a repetition of this pair's many previous successes. The first clutch of
four eggs was laid in mid-August ; one of these proved infertile,
the other three hatched and left the nest on 17th October, being two
cocks and one hen. The first egg of the second clutch, again of four,
was laid on 8th November, and four young were seen on 3rd December.
All were reared, being two of each sex, and leaving the nest on 5th and
6th January.
25. Red-rumped Parrakeet (Ps. hcematonotus). --This pair laid
four eggs early in November and incubated steadily, but all proved
infertile.

26. Bourke Grass-Parrakeet (, Neophema bourki). --The first clutch
of five eggs was laid late in August, all hatched, and four, two of each
sex, were successfully reared. The second clutch consisted of fourteen
eggs, which were incubated spasmodically and finally deserted early
in December. A third clutch of four was laid in mid-December ;
only one of these proved fertile and the young bird, a cock, was reared
and left the nest on 26th January.
27. Blue-winged Grass-Parrakeet (JSf. chrysostoma) .--This pair,
the hen of which laid two clutches of malformed eggs in the previous
season, became interested in the log late in November, and the hen
proceeded to incubate '' the abstract idea of eggs ", to borrow
Tavistock's phrase, until the log was removed in January.
28. Elegant Grass-Parrakeet (N. elegans) .--The first clutch of
four eggs was laid towards the end of August and three young were
seen on 24th September. These were reared and proved two cocks
and a hen. The second clutch was commenced at the end of October
and was replaced by the eggs which the Hooded hen had deserted ;
these had evidently been chilled too long and no result was obtained.
A third clutch of four was laid in mid-December, but all were clear.

The second clutch, again of four, was laid late in October ; all
hatched, but one died when very young. The remaining three were
seen to be thriving on 30th November when a single young Scarlet-
chested of the same age was placed in the log. The three young
Turquoisines (two cocks and a hen) left the nest on 20th December
and the Scarlet-chested the next day. All of this brood, including
the Scarlet-chested, lost all of their tail feathers within a fortnight of
leaving the log and were rather slow in growing them again.
32. Scarlet-chested Grass-Parrakeet (jV. splendida). --The first

Turquoisines, as just described. No further clutch eventuated, as

TEN YEARS WITH THE PAINTED FINCH
AND SOME HISTORICAL NOTES
{Cayleyna picta)
By Leonard G. Webber

Before setting out in some order an accumulation of jumbled notes
on this attractive finch, it will perhaps be better to explain the title
and how this article was inspired. On return to Sydney in 1945, after
nearly five years' absence, I re-read the back numbers of the
Avicultural Magazine and came across the first recorded breeding
in Australia of the Painted Finch ( Emblema picta) , correctly Cayleyna
picta (q.v.), and this was just ten years ago ; although the actual
breeding took place during the latter part of the year prior to the
publication of the story in the Magazine.
The same year (1935) and in the November issue, an English success
appeared with this bird ; however, this was not the " first " for England.
Cayley, in Australian Finches in Bush and Aviary , quoting Dr. Hopkinson,
says was Wilford first breeder in U.K. in 1910.
Little seems to have been published on the habits of this bird and,
of course, the war interfered with the study of what was becoming a
well-known bird in England.
In Australia the aviculturist was much more fortunate and to-day
the Painted Finch can be considered a common bird in captivity.
With the end of the war and the prospects of this bird again being
seen in the U.K., I considered that all information gathered here in
recent years should appear in the Magazine for the benefit of the
members of the Society, so that they need not be five or six years
behind the times regarding its habits.
It was strange, that after a long break (1910-1935), simultaneous
breedings should occur in widely separated places and both appear
in the Avicultural Magazine the same year. About this time very
little was known of the Painted Finch, even here in its own country,
and, according to Cayley, no living example had ever been offered
for sale in Sydney--this was in 1932, when his book was first published.

150 LEONARD C. WEBBER-TEN YEARS WITH THE PAINTED FINCH
This and the published notes in the Avicultural Magazine are the
only recorded historical data available, and I found it extremely
difficult to find among our local aviculturists anyone that could add
to it. However, the few historical notes contained herein are, perhaps,
of some interest, as they have not hitherto appeared in print.
Historical Notes
In 1892 a pair of Painted Finches were in the collection of the
Sydney Zoo--this was during the time when the Zoo was a small
affair situated at Moore Park, Sydney, before it became the world-
famous Taronga Park Zoo. Mr. G. Gamp, a Head Keeper, told this
to Mr. E. Hargreaves, another Keeper at the Zoo, who had promised
to help me in getting early dates. Hargreaves later handed me some
notes from which the following is taken.
" In the same year that the Zoo had these birds, and they originated
from Queensland, odd birds were seen in the stalls at the Victoria
markets. They were in mixed consignments that arrived from the
Queensland trappers. It seems to have disappeared until 1932, when
a trapper travelling overland from Darwin to Sydney exchanged
some Gouldians for Painted Finches way out in the back blocks of
Queensland. Five birds arrived here and were bought for #10 per pair
by an aviculturist, Darvel Hunt by name, from the late Abbie Parsons.
" In October the following year (1933) about ten dozen arrived
from Brisbane and were on sale at Turner's Railway Bird Shop at
#5 per pair."
From this time on small lots appeared at more or less regular
intervals in the bird shops and increased in numbers to such an extent
that the prevailing price just before the war was 30L per pair.
At a meeting of the N.S.W. Finch Club, September, 1945, a visitor
mentioned that he had known the Painted Finch many years, but
could not give any accurate dates ; he said he was born in Western
Australia, and as a boy remembers seeing them in cages and veranda
aviaries, and they were as common a cage-bird in the West as the
Zebra and Redhead (Sydney Waxbill) is in this State. I did not get
his name.
When my ship called into Durban (East Africa) in 1943 I was
introduced to an old German bird man, of some renown in the
trapping world in days gone by ; he was Mr. Grie--he made it clear
from the very outset that he was a naturalized New Zealand subject,
which seemed to clear the air. In my notebook I see that I recorded
a very remarkable statement by Grie to the effect that he took the
Painted Finch from Berlin to Sydney in 1890 ; he did not say how the
birds first got to Germany, but stated that they were a special order
to an aviculturist here.

General Notes
Difference in Plumage. --Cayley, quoting Mathews, gives five races,
or geographical sub-species, the differences being a mere variation
in shade of colour of back or underparts ; no mention is made of
size, shape, or number of spots. Observation of birds in my possession
past and present, show two distinct colour phases, the first is the more
highly coloured of the two--the general description follows that of
Cayley except that the back and wings are suffused with crimson right
up to the neck, when seen in the sun they appear to have a crimson
sheen on the parts mentioned ; with these birds the white spots are
more numerous, especially around the throat and upper breast, and
are larger in size, and so close together on the flanks that at a distance
appear as a broad, white line. The throat and upper breast spots are
round, smallest on the throat, and the flank spots are in the form of
even-shaped ovals decreasing in size under the vent. The scarlet of
the face shows a clean-cut line and not scalloped with blunt incisions
along the margin as depicted by Cayley.
In the hens the back is suffused as for the cocks, the chin spots being
mere pin-points and very numerous, the whole of the chin, throat and
breast being densely spotted, with the flanks following the normal
colour scheme of the cocks, except that the spots extend almost to the
extremity of the under tail-coverts. Young bred from these follow the
pattern of the parents.
In the second phase the back and wings are brown, the white
spots smaller and less numerous, retaining a roundish shape throughout.
In the cocks the throat and breast being almost devoid of spotting.
The scarlet on the face is scalloped ; the scarlet breast line is more
extensive, in some cases only just separated from the scarlet chin.
There appears to be a great deal of variation in the scarlet markings
of the cocks, both in shape and size ; it may be a long, narrow streak
or broad one, a roundish patch low on the breast, an irregular patch
high on the breast ; in some birds the chin and breast scarlet almost
meets, and there is at present in a Sydney aviary a bird with a brilliant
unbroken broad scarlet line from the chin to the lower abdomen.
Abnormal Coloured Birds. --Abnormal coloured birds appear both in
wild life and captivity. I possessed a cock wild caught that had two
white feathers in the left wing.
Two other abnormals were reported in the Bulletin of the Australian
Avicultural Society (not affiliated). September, 1943, Mr. H. S.

Hall, of Kingaroy, Queensland, writes : "I am writing to draw your
attention to a freak coloured Emblema picta bred just over two years
ago, but just coloured up. Rump, upper tail coverts, breast and face
markings golden orange instead of the normal crimson, all other
markings normal."
June, 1944, a South Australian member (no name) in an article on
abnormal coloured birds, reports having recently seen a fawn Emblema
picta , no details were given.
In the notes from Hargreaves I find mention of another similar to
the above : " Dr. Garnet Halloran, a successful breeder of Painteds,
reared two abnormal coloured birds, the head and rump were orange--
after trying to breed from them he disposed of them to G. Steele, but
he too had no success."
Recently two hens bred by me showed abnormal colour on leaving
the nest, and are now moulting out ; one is densely spotted from chin
to the upper abdomen and down the flanks, the under tail-coverts are
barred with fine whitish markings--the abdomen, normally black, is
barred as the under tail-coverts and the markings are similar to one
of our very rare Finches, the Red Eared Firetail. The second follows
more or less the same markings, but is less distinct--it will be interesting
to see just how they moult out.
Hybrids .--No hybrids have been reported as far as I know, and no
special attempts have been made among the many aviculturists of my
acquaintance. For some unknown reason they are still considered rara
aves and aviculturists will not use them for other than pure breeding.
Having bred an excess of hens, I decided on my return home to pair
them up for hybridizing, and the following pairs were put up :
Diamond Sparrow x Painted ; Zebra x Painted ; Star Finch x
Painted. The first pair, after being caged some weeks, were released
in a large grown aviary and the Diamond started displaying the first
day ; within five days a nest was built in a privet bush and no more
progress was made. The Diamond still displays vigorously and the
hen Painted often sits on the perch alongside him during the displays,
so am hoping and waiting.
The second pair were placed in a portable aviary 4 ft. by 4ft. by 3 ft.
Torch visits during the night revealed that they were on friendly
terms, so much so that they roosted side by side on what has now
proved to be the foundations of a nest ; the hen Painted started her
moult, which held up nesting activities, and at the time of writing a
nest has been constructed.
The Star x Painted pair were also placed in a portable aviary, and
up to date have shown no interest at all in each other.
Using the cock Painted as a possible hybridizer was tried out during
my absence--my wife placed two cocks with three hen Zebras ;
numerous eggs were laid, but we are of the opinion the Painteds

were in no way responsible. The hen Zebras apparently having an
egg-laying competition amongst themselves.
Sexing .--Observations prove that on leaving the nest, young birds
show sufficient sexual characters to enable them to be correctly sexed,
and so become the easiest of all the Australian Finches to sex, and this
atThe early age of the first day out of the nest. The deciding factor is
simple and conspicuous, the juvenile plumage is very similar to the
parents, without the brilliant scarlet, and of course generally duller,
elsewhere the spots are distinct at close quarters, and it is with the
spotting the sexing is done. The hens show pin-point spots on the
chin, especially in close proximity to the lower mandible, and are
generally more densely spotted on the throat and breast; the cocks
lack this pin-point chin spotting and the breast spots are less
numerous--that then is all that is necessary to observe--if, however,
there is any doubt in the mind of the observer, and there shouldn't
be, it is only a matter of ten to fourteen days before the adult plumage
starts showing, the spots become really white and the scarlet will show
under the chin of the cocks. This should dispel any further doubt.
During sexing trials, another point under observation was the
appearance of spots on the under tail coverts which most hens possess ;
however, this is unreliable and really unnecessary.
In hens which lack an abundance of chin spots, sexing can be
determined within ten days by the black chin of the hen in opposition
to the scarlet of the cocks ; this is on the chin proper in close proximity
to the lower mandible.
Mating Display .--The display is an unusual one and differs from all
other Australian Finches. No grass is held in the bill during the
performance. The cock bird will alight near the hen and, adopting
an almost upright stance, with the head help up, bill pointing in the
air about 60 degrees from the horizontal, commences his song--if
it can be called such, four quickly repeated notes, monotone, during
which time the head is moved smartly from side to side; this is followed
by a quaint throaty noise, difficult to describe, but reminds one of a
familiar suck and blow noise on a very battered mouth organ, and not
unlike the Zebra Finch. During this part the head is kept still, but
remains pointing upwards. The performance is repeated four or five
times when, if the hen moves, the cock will follow and give a repetition.
Observations with four breeding pairs did not reveal any variation
in the method of display, and the quickly uttered notes during the
side movement of the head were always four, and the peculiar jerky
side swinging of the head is made about 35 degrees each way, and
never exceeds three to the right or left--no bobbing up and down on
the perch was observed during the display, a popular method with
other Australian Finches. The hen appears to be unmoved by the
efforts of the cock and usually remains still on the perch or on the

<bodyText confidence="0.995362711111111" page_id="56288944"  page_num="154" year="" vol="">
ground; on rare occasions a hen would turn her head in the direction
of the cock, as if to see what was going one.
Nesting Habits .--Like most other Australian Finches, the Painted is
adaptable in captivity and in its nesting habits uses material and
nesting sites foreign to its native habitat.
In large aviaries with planted shrubs the situation selected for
nesting most likely follows that in wild life, and once again shows a
difference compared with other Australian Finches, small stones, gravel
and dried mud, being used as a nest foundation.
They will construct their homes on the ground, in living shrubs and
trees, in dried tea-tree lining aviary walls, boxes, tins, wire netting
containers, and on ledges and shelves. When boxes and the like are
selected the nest follows the general pattern built by most birds which
adopt these receptacles.
My own birds showed individual preference and when a pair had
successfully reared a brood in one type of box, they almost invariably
kept to that type--generally they are bad builders ; one nest was so
badly constructed that it collapsed--four eggs were found lodged in
the tea-tree. Selected examples of nest building are as follows--one
pair selected a square box and when the young had vacated the nest,
it was dismantled and notes taken of the materials. On the bottom
of the box was a layer of small pieces of soil, charcoal, small stones, and
three cones from the pencil pine. How the birds lifted and placed the
cones in the box is a mystery ; they are over an inch long and almost
the same in diameter at the largest part. On top of this were dried
grasses, chickweed, teased manilla rope fibre, some horsehair and a
few feathers. It was just piled in the box almost to the lid and was not
domed over ; on opening the lid it appeared as a shallow, cup-shaped
nest. Another pair took over a partly lined tin left by a Diamond
Sparrow and, without any additions, reared a brood ; when removed
the nesting material was just a thin, hard layer. This tin was placed
twelve feet high and an exception for height--usually they build three
to six feet from the ground.
The cock plays a major part in the construction, the hen assisting
on occasions, mostly inside the nest and, strangely, was not seen
carrying to the nest. The same nest may be used for a second brood,
but may be partly rebuilt, relined, or a new nest constructed.
The clutch is normally four, the eggs being white, similar to other
Grass Finches. Breeding activities go on the whole year.
Feeding .--Of the various seeds available, a preference is shown for
yellow millet, but, once again, there is individual variation in taste ;
some eat Jap millet, others canary seed, but the yellow millet forms the
bulk of the food, most species of seeding grasses, native and imported,
are consumed, and chickweed appears in my aviaries the most popular
greenfood, lettuce and milk thistles also being eaten.

<bodyText confidence="0.997749222222222" page_id="56288945"  page_num="155" year="" vol="">
Drinking. --The method of drinking is, I think, worthy of mention.
The Australian Grass Finches, as a rule, carry out this function by
keeping the bill immersed in the water--the Painted takes a beakful,
swallows, and dips again--similar to a Canary.
Feeding the Young. --I have successfully bred many of these birds and
in every case they were reared entirely on seed, no live food being
provided ; however, they may have secured a certain amount from
the shrubs and the ground ; I rather doubt that this would be
sufficient to rear young.
Incubation. --Both birds take turns in incubating and the period
varies with the seasons ; my notes show fifteen days from the last
egg in the summer, and up to nineteen days in the winter ; my notes
also show variation in the time the young are in the nest, mid-winter
times were up to twenty-five days, summer nineteen days ; however,
these times require further investigating and it is not always convenient
or advisable to keep poking into nests to record times and dates. In
fact I even doubted my own observations, but then gave consideration
to the variation in the length of the days and the amount of food that
would be consumed, on short or long days, thus having some bearing
on the time spent in the nest, and likewise the internal temperature of
the nest affecting the incubation. I am, of course, prepared to admit
a mistake if one has been made, and it is an unusual state of affairs,
this variation in incubation and time in the nest.
The young are independent of the parents ten days after leaving the
nest and can be safely taken away and caged or placed in another
aviary ; the young will go to nest before they have completely assumed
the adult moult, and successfully rear their brood.
As a variation from my own observations, I have notes from other
successful breeders of this bird ; they have interesting points.
R. J. Murray, of Melbourne, Victoria, who recently rejoined the
Society writes : "I did not record the date when I purchased my
first Painteds, but they cost me #4 iol a pair." (Mr. Murray should
not complain, I have a cutting taken from Cage Birds (English),
10th May, 1935--Painted Finches #25 a pair--L. G. W.)
" They are rather shy and entirely unoffensive in the aviary ; after
a short period they built and laid, but found that they would desert
if interfered with by the other inmates--never at any time did they
attempt to defend their nest--the nest building is interesting. My
birds started by making a platform of short, coarse grass stalks and
small twigs, on this they piled lumps of soil from the size of peas to
grapes, to this was added what appeared to be short dried grass that
had lain on the ground and dirt had adhered to--these pieces varied
in size, up to the diameter of a shilling. I often wondered how the
birds conveyed such large pieces to the nest ; this again was covered
with dried grass, then the nest proper was constructed, being composed

of dried fine grass with sisal fibre intermixed, the nest was dome-
shaped and built in the tea-tree lining of the shelter--distance from
the ground four feet. The number of eggs varied from three to six,
and better results were obtained when not more than one pair were in
an aviary.
" Although a little live food is consumed when not feeding young,
prodigious quantities were eaten when young were in the nest."
Hargreaves, who has already been mentioned, has some outstanding
observations recorded in his notes.
" Purchased my first pair in November, 1933, from A. J. Turner,
paying #3 105. a pair---put them in with a mixed collection of Finches,
but they made no attempt to breed, appearing extremely nervous, and
spending most of the time on the floor of the aviary.
" In the following March was offered twelve pairs. I snapped them
up. They were placed in a small aviary that had previously contained
a pair of Parrakeets--the size of the aviary was 10 ft. by 4 ft. by 6 ft. 6 in.
high, the shelter sheds were 4 feet deep, the flight took up the
remaining 6 feet ; cuttings from shrubs were placed in the shed and
a banksia tree in the corner of the flight near the shed. There were
no breeding activities until the following July, when seven pairs
nested in the banksia tree in the flight--all the nests were together,
one on top of the other---just an untidy column of grass, small stones,
and pieces of termites' nest. This community nest, and it did give
one the impression that they were community breeders, was about
18 in. high and 6 in. in diameter--fifteen young were reared in that
clump of nests.
" Another two pairs nested on the ground, in the front end of the
flight--the previous occupants (Parrots) had dug holes in both front
corners and this is where these Painteds built their nests. They seemed
to sense the fact that hollows would hold water and submerge their
homes, so they set to work and filled up the holes in both corners with
small stones and pieces of termites' nest, until the nest foundation
was one inch above the aviary floor-level. The aviary doors, giving
access to adjacent aviary, were at the end of the flight section, and one
had to step over the nests each time entering and leaving the aviaries.
Strange to relate, this did not disturb the sitting birds, who casually
poked their heads out but were never flushed from the nest ; one pair
reared two, the other one from those particular nests--for the season
a total of forty young were reared.
" The food supplied was Hungarian millet and Canary seed, seeding
grasses, sprouted millet, and white ants."
From South Australia Mr. A Phillips writes : "In building, I
have noticed Emblema picta were partial to blue wool for lining their
nests." Later he mentions : "I have frequently had two hens lay
and sit in the same nest ; whether a single cock had mated with both

hens I cannot say--on one occasion the two hens reared ten young
from twelve eggs in the one nest--in another nest later these same
two hens reared eight young in a single nest, the two hens sitting side

Odd Notes of Interest

1. A variation in the method of display was noted recently--three
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.848009567567568" page_id="56288947"  page_num="157" year="" vol="">
young cocks were placed in with a mixed collection of Finches, and
one of them a few months older than the other two was constantly
calling and uttering the display notes ; this attracted my attention
and hybrids flashed through my mind, so I kept watch and saw this
cock displaying to both the other cocks, and he held a grass stalk in
his bill, crouched over the perch, bobbed up and down, and more or
less performed the Diamond Sparrow display--he is earmarked for a
future hybrid pair.
2. Most observers say these birds are inoffensive, which is generally
the case; however, the hen paired with the Diamond Sparrow was
seen to chase a hen Madagascar Weaver and a cock Blood Finch
(Crimson Finch) from the vicinity of the nest constructed by the
Diamond.
3. The hen roosts out after the tenth day of hatching, but constant
visits with a torch did not reveal any night feeding; the pair roost
together, and during the nights under observation were always in the
same position at each visit.
4. Owing to shortages of material for building new aviaries, I
purchased a number of second-hand portable aviaries, average floor
area 4 ft. by 4 ft., and in one of them placed a breeding pair of
Painteds. Interior decorating consisted of cuttings from shrubs and
various nesting devices placed in different positions. A jam tin was
selected as a nest and four eggs were laid and hatched ; the young
were deserted after almost ten days, no doubt through my interference
taking notes of breeding proceedings. They went to nest again within
three weeks, and no observations were recorded ; in due course three
young left the nest, which is sufficient proof that they will breed in small
compartments ; these young birds were reared entirely on seed.
Another pair were placed in a large cage, 3 ft. by 2 ft. and 3 ft.
high ; one nest-box was hung up, charcoal and a handful of crumbled
earth was put on the cage bottom ; the box was occupied and a nest
built ; some weeks later the hen was found dead in the nest, death
assumed from egg-binding--did not persist in the experiment.
Renaming the Painted Finch
During my travels I have heard varying names given to the Painted
Finch, and even here in Australia it is often referred to as the True
Painted Finch to distinguish it from the Gouldian, which is also called

the Painted Finch. The use of its generic name is also very popular
and this too, with varying spelling and pronunciation ; the name I
am referring to is, of course, Emblema picta , and, although outdated,
is perhaps the most popular one in use to-day throughout the British
Empire--Cayley in Australian Finches and What Bird is That gives
Cayleyna picta.
To clear the matter up entirely for my own satisfaction, I wrote to
the Australian Museum, Sydney, my letter was passed on to our well-
known ornithologist, Dr. Tom Iredale, who sent me a reprint of the
original change as it appeared in Australian Zoologist which I quote in
full.
Reprinted from the Australian Zoologist, vol. vi, pt. ii, issued
14th January, 1930--under the heading " Some Notable Name
Changes
" Cayleyna in honour of my friend, Mr. N. W. Cayley, for the
beautiful Finch known as Emblema picta, so named by Gould ; there are
other " Caleys" in the field and as far as I have traced the name has
not yet been utilized. When Gould introduced [Birds of Australia,
pt. vii, June, 1842), his generic name, he was not aware that there
was any prior use, but it has long been known that Rafinesque had
proposed Amblema.
I noted that Desheyes, in 1840 [Diet. Univ. d&apos;hist. Nat. (Orbigny),
vol. i, p. 334), proposed Emblema as a better spelling than Amblema,
and this unfortunately invalidates Gould's name."
This will explain, therefore, my use of the name Cayleyna picta ;
I have, however, left the name Emblema picta where it was so used by
the writers of the accompanying notes.

General Summary
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99751" page_id="56288948"  page_num="158" year="" vol="">
When rare or uncommon birds are introduced or reintroduced to
Aviculture, they are almost invariably labelled " Handle with care--
Delicate ". Cayleyna picta is no exception to this rule--as time goes on
and its habits are better known, the writing on the label wears out
and another bird takes its place on the rarity list. We have now
reached the stage where Cayleyna picta should be classified as a common
aviary bird and it actually is in this country--every aviculturist in
Australia who can live up to the name has bred this bird ; it is offered
for sale frequently and it appears in the bird shops and on the stalls
in the markets, yet it is still spoken of and referred to as " Rare "
Painted Finch. Let us be done with this and, whilst on the job, call
it by its correct name.
Cayleyna picta is a hardy and inoffensive bird, a good breeder, and
an ideal bird for both the beginner and experienced aviculturist
alike--it is being bred more frequently in Australia than any other
Australian Finch with the exception of the Zebra and the Gouldian.

During the past few months several members have asked for a list
of the Society's Medal-winners. Unfortunately an official roll has
not been kept, so I have endeavoured to compile one from the awards
published from time to time in volumes of the Avicultural Magazine.
This list, comprising nearly two hundred awards, is, I believe, as
complete as the records allow. On numerous occasions in the past
a breeding account has been followed by a footnote to the effect that
the member concerned appears to be entitled to a Medal ; there-
after nothing further appears in connection with it and one is left
wondering whether or no Council has made an award. Also, there
are several bald announcements that all outstanding Medals have
been sent, without any previous indication as to whom it was pro-
posed to make awards.
Should any member have an award that has been omitted from this
list, I would be glad to have particulars, so that it may be as complete
as possible.

Friends in Fur and Feather. By Frances Pitt. Price 12s. 6 d.
Published by Country Life, Ltd., 2-10 Tavistock Street, London,
W.C. 2.
Miss Frances Pitt's long and intimate experience in keeping both
mammals and birds, coupled with her charm of writing, make any-
thing from her pen welcome, and the latest addition is a complete
book of the many and varied pets she has kept.

Miss Pitt has kept most of her birds at semi-liberty and her knowledge
as a field-naturalist, and one who has a particular flair for taming
wild creatures, makes her book both appealing and instructive.
She has kept birds ranging from Hawks, Owls, Ravens, and Magpies
to Geese, and has succumbed, as most people, to the fascination of
these birds ; Pheasants and Peacocks, a Macaw at liberty, a Song-
Thrush and Bullfinch are also included among her pets. A concluding
chapter on " The Care of Pets 55 gives a word of warning regarding
releasing captive-bred birds and on the necessity for realizing future
responsibilities when " adopting " an orphan of the wild.
The book is profusely illustrated with excellent photographs by
the author.

Dr. Derscheid's favourite corner of the park. The President and members of the
Avicultural Society were represented at the ceremony by Mr. John Yealland.
As a tribute to the memory of Dr. Derscheid, and a token of gratitude for the help
he gave to British airmen, his son, Jean-Pierre Derscheid has been made an Honorary
member of the Avicultural Society.
British Aviculturists' Club.
A meeting of the British Aviculturists' Club will be held at the Hotel Rembrandt,
Thurloe Place, South Kensington, on Wednesday, 18th Sept., at 6 p.m. Monsieur
Jean Delacour will show colour films brought from America, including the display
of the Umbrella Bird, and Humming Birds in slow motion. The meeting will be
followed by a dinner.
" Deliberate Rudeness " of Parrakeet.
The following amusing example of what appeared to be deliberate rudeness on
the part of one Parrakeet towards another is worth recording. One of my largest
aviaries housed a pair of Crimson-winged Parrots, a pair of Cockatiels, and an odd
cock Green Rosella (Yellow-bellied Parrakeet). The last mentioned has always been
rather a misogymist and I have never been aisle to persuade him to mate with a hen
of his own species. Recently I had occasion to introduce into the same aviary an
escaped cock Eastern Rosella that I had succeeded in catching on my aviaries. The
reception was most amusing. The Green Rosella cock flew on to the same perch and
slowly advanced towards the Eastern, making all the motions of regurgitating food
from his crop. The Eastern, although looking slightly suspicious, stood his ground
until the big fellow was right upon him when instead of the expected food he received
the most violent cuff! One could almost imagine the green fellow saying as he
approached, " You are a pretty poor looking specimen, I believe you must be a hen ,
I think I'll feed you ! " Thereafter there was a pretty tidy scrap but they have now
settled down to something in the nature of an armed truce. Just what would happen
if a hen Broadtail was introduced I shudder to think.

Breeding of King Parrot in Immature Plumage.
A friend of mine, Mr. I. Banyer, of Blackwood, South Australia, recently succeeded
in breeding two young King Parrots ( Aprosmictus scapularis ). This in itself is no mean
feat, as I am only aware of two or three other successful breedings of this species in
South Australia. To my mind, however, the interesting feature was that the male
parent was still in immature plumage ! I saw the birds soon after the young were
flying and the father showed no sign of assumption of the red head. Mr. Banyer has
since informed me that the cock bird shortly afterwards commenced to moult and
rapidly assumed full adult plumage.

Some Interesting Birds Recently Received at the London Zoo.
Through the kindness of Mr. Sydney Porter three interesting New Zealand birds
have been received in the collection :--
A specimen of the Norfolk Island Parrakeet which is very similar to the New
Zealand Parrakeet ( Cyanorhamphus pacificus ). This bird was recently exhibited at a
scientific meeting of the Zoological Society--it is housed in one of the outside aviaries
of the Parrot House with one of the Queen Alexandra's Parrakeets, also two ducks both
new to the Zoo--New Zealand Scaup ( Nyroca novaseelandite) though fairly common
in New Zealand owing to protection--never before imported and the New Zealand
Brown Duck ( Elasmonetta chlorotis) which can be seen in the Waders' Aviary, now
inhabited by Swans and Ducks of various species. This bird has not been imported
alive before and I believe Mr. Sydney Porter was the first aviculturist to bring it over.
The Zoo also have purchased from Mr. Sydney Porter a Grey Struthidea, an Occipital
Blue Pie, and some Australian Black-breasted Plover. An Ostrich has recently been
transferred from Whipsnade to the Ostrich House. A Great Crested Grebe has also
been received from there. A Coscoroba Swan has been received in exchange--there
has not been one in the gardens for a long time--it is now in Three Island Pond.
The Parrot House has lost two of its old inhabitants, the Purple-capped and Black
Lories, both these birds have been in the collection a great many years.

The Aviculturalist and the Field Ornithologist have many objectives
in common. They have not only a scientific but a cultural and an
aesthetic contribution to make to our civilization, and it is important
that they should work hand in hand towards these ends. But there is
at present a point of conflict, for the Field Ornithologist complains
with some justification that when he sees a rare bird, and particularly
a rare waterfowl, he has no way of knowing whether it has escaped
from some collection or whether it has in fact made a journey of
perhaps thousands of miles from a far away land. And while there
may be no vastly important scientific significance in the occasional
occurrence of a rare vagrant, no ornithologist can fail to enjoy the
romantic thrill of watching a bird which has only been seen perhaps
a few dozen times before in our country.
Such a pleasure has fallen to my lot twice during the last year.
In July I was walking through the " duckery " of Mr. Spedan
Lewis's estate in the Test Valley at Leckford with my friend Terry
Jones, when we suddenly saw an Alpine Swift amongst 50 or 60
Common Swifts hawking up and down the river. For half an hour we
watched this beautiful bird--much larger than a Common Swift
and with a conspicuous white belly--a bird which has only been
recorded some 30 times in England.
Last winter, on the estuary of the Severn, amongst the great flocks
of Whitefronted Geese, we found two Lesser Whitefronted Geese,
the third and fourth examples of this species to be positively identified
in this country. A limited number of inquiries were sufficient to
establish the overwhelming probability that these birds were wild,
visitors just as the Alpine Swift must certainly have been.
There was considerably greater doubt, however, about the origin
of two (or possibly three) Blue Snow Geese which were seen amongst
the Greylags and Whitefronts on the Wexford Slob last winter. A

number of breeding Blue Snows are kept in captivity and some at
least of their offspring have been allowed to go full winged, and are
known to have wandered away. On the other hand, the Blue Goose
breeds in the Hudson's Bay region, and winters on the coast of the
Gulf of Mexico, at the eastern side of the range of its very near relative,
the Lesser Snow Goose, with which it usually keeps company, and
even hybridizes in the wild state. Most of the records of Lesser Snow
in this country can be traced to the full winged breeding flock kept at
Woburn, but there is one record--the first--which is earlier than
the Woburn flock. It is a record of three shot in 1871 on the Wexford
Slob. The skins leave no doubt that these were Lesser rather than
Greater Snow Geese, and if three Lesser Snows in 1871 why not three
Blues in 1946. The likelihood of escape, however, has this time
effectively prevented the possible addition of a new bird not only to
the British but to the European list.
Clearly this is a pity and suggests that, without any very great
effort, aviculturalists might, at least to a large extent, remedy these
circumstances and remove the grounds for the field ornithologists'
complaint. This could, I believe, be done by establishing a registry,
by means of which aviculturalists could make known what birds they
were keeping full winged and which, if any, had wandered away.
The scope of the registry might well be widened so as to be of great
benefit to the aviculturalist himself.
It would, for example, be both interesting and useful to know what
species and numbers of birds are being kept in this country, what birds
have been bred, what birds in each collection are available for sale
or exchange.
Never has this requirement been more urgent that it is to-day when
only the remnants of so many fine pre-war collections remain and when
so many people are awaiting the opportunity to start again (or even
to start for the first time) the fascinating pursuit of keeping ornamental
waterfowl.
Practically nothing remains of my own pre-war collection which I
kept at my lighthouse on The Wash ; but already my plans are well
advanced for starting a new collection in a new and ideal place. On
the estuary of the Severn, where we identified the Lesser White-
fronts last year, several thousand Whitefronted Geese have spent each
winter from immemorial times. They roost far out on the sandbanks
at the tail of the river and they feed on the green saltings and grass
fields of an area known as the New Grounds, which is flat, alluvial
land reclaimed from the estuary. On this same stretch, many thousands
of ducks also spend the winter, and two ancient duck-decoys lie
sheltered, each in its own spinney of trees amongst the flat green fields.
Beside one of these decoys is the cottage which will be the centre of a
scheme for a Wildfowl Observatory. Not only will the facilities for

observing and studying the wild geese be improved, but also the decoy
will be put into working order as a ringing station and a new collection
of waterfowl will be established in the surrounding marshes, which
are ideal for keeping geese (and geese will be the backbone of the
collection in order to provide material for my monograph of the Wild
geese which is now in preparation).
Although at present there is no very large sheet of open water, most
of the fifty acres of the proposed new enclosure are liable to flood in
winter and can be artificially flooded at all times of the year, from a
virtually inexhaustible supply.
Conditions will be better for surface feeding than for diving ducks,
but some of the ditches should be deep enough for the latter and the
spinney round the decoy will be ideal for less hardy species such as
Tree ducks. Altogether the new observatory should make a pleasant
and instructive local amenity, which may broaden the general interest
in the subject of waterfowl. In developing the scheme, the proposed
registry would be of enormous assistance. From it we should find out
what birds are left in this country. We should find no doubt that some
of the species which were fairly common before the war are no longer
represented. We should find that some rarer birds have chanced to
breed (like the Puna Teal at Leckford) and are now commoner than
many of the familiar old favourites. We should find--and this is most
important--a number of unmated birds, odd males, odd females,
which if put together might perpetuate a breeding stock of the species,
a stock which would otherwise die out and have to be re-imported,
with years of delay while the wild-caught birds were persuaded to
breed.
How many breeding pairs of Maned Geese are left in this country
to-day--(I know that there are several odd unmated birds). How
many Orinocos ?--How many Versicolors ? How many Tree ducks?
The answers to these questions are important to British aviculture.
Initially it may be difficult to trace all the smaller collections where
only a few birds are kept, particularly as many of their owners are
not members of the Society, but at worst we should know a great
deal more than we do at present about the status of our birds in
captivity.
It may be said that some aviculturalists will not wish to divulge the
exact statistics of their collections, but I believe none the less that
there are very few who would not, in the interests of aviculture, agree
to co-operate in the scheme.
The Editor has consented to undertake the work of co-ordination,
and those who wish can put the scheme into immediate operation by
sending in answers to the following questions :
1. What species of waterfowl, other than Mallard and domestic
varieties, do you keep, and how many of each ?

2. Which of them are hand reared and which wild caught ?

<bodyText confidence="0.9642395" page_id="56288966"  page_num="170" year="" vol="">
who keeps waterfowl and to whom a copy of this questionnaire
should be sent ?
There is a further way in which the confusion about stray birds might
be avoided. If aviculturalists could obtain suitable rings of the same
type as (but distinct from) those used in the marking scheme, and
make every attempt to ring their full winged birds, not only would the
ring very probably be visible to the observer who chanced to see the
bird after it had strayed, but should the bird be caught in a decoy or
shot, the fact would be recorded and the aviculturalist informed, which
might well be of personal interest.
Any further suggestions for improving the schemes for a waterfowl
registry and census and for marking full winged birds will be most
welcome. With full co-operation from all those who keep these
beautiful birds, I believe that by this means we can build up our
waterfowl resources in a very much shorter time than seems other-
wise possible.

The keeping of waterfowl and their successful rearing has been
a rare hobby in the north-eastern United States. Now with the end
of the war there has been a considerable awakening of interest in
anatine aviculture, and several new collections have appeared. The
eastern part of the United States has always lagged far behind the
west, but one or two good new collections have been developed in New
England which bid fair to replace in importance the collection of
Mr. C. L. Sibley, which was broken up during the war.
Mr. Charles L. Copeland, of Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts, a new
member of the Avicultural Society, has been keeping waterfowl for
only six years, but he has already had several spectacular successes.
His collection until this summer has been kept literally in his back-
yard. His charming house had a rather limited area of ground behind,

and that rocky and full of scrub and second growth. Nothing daunted,
however, Mr. Copeland cleared the scrub and built a pen about
75 by 150 feet on a level spot, and in it placed a concrete pool,
connected to his tap water supply by a series of smaller pools and
channels at different levels. The ground is covered with small pebbles,
and there are quite a number of low bushes, laurel and azaleas.
Neighbours' houses are all about and people seem to be in evidence
a good deal.
In spite of this unfavourable-sounding environment, Mr. Copeland
has had notable success rearing such" difficult " species as Ruddy Ducks
and Golden-eyes. Keeping such a small pool clean would seem to be
a problem, but Mr. Copeland tells me that he drains it fairly often,
and in between times drops in 50 lb. or more of epsom salts ! This
apparently has a salutary effect on his birds, and they are in as sleek,
good condition as waterfowl I have seen anywhere.
Comparing diet schedules is always interesting to the aviculturist,
and a brief note on what Mr. Copeland feeds his birds may be of
interest here. Four days a week the birds are given grains, one day a
week they are starved, and the remaining two are divided between a
day of a chopped lettuce diet, and a day of ground horse meat. I was
surprised at the fact that virtually all his birds, not just the diving tribe,
will eat the latter.
This year Mr. Copeland has reared his first American Eider (from
wild-caught eggs), Buffleheads, Golden-eyes, Ruddy Duck, and Wood
Duck. Mr. Copeland has just bought a large estate in Wellesley a few
miles from his former home, and plans to build a good-sized natural
pond there. In many ways, of course, this will be an advantage, but
under his present conditions, his birds have become wonderfully tame,
and I doubt if they will remain so on a large pond. To sit on a bench
in his small pond and watch his little flock of Golden-eyes going
through their full display within 10 feet, is to be privileged indeed.
Mr. John W. Livermore is another keeper of waterfowl whose
collection has really developed during the war years, although he has
kept birds of other kinds for a long time. He has recently made a
new enclosure of several acres of mixed woods, scrub, and open land
planted to alfalfa. Where a small spring drains down into his valley,
Mr. Livermore has constructed a pond with concrete walls cleverly
camouflaged with earthen dykes. This provides him with a pond
about 50 yards by 100 yards square. An interesting problem was
the bottom of the new pond which turned out to be porous enough
to let the water out when it was filled. Rather than put concrete
down, Mr. Livermore put in an asphalt bottom, which will gradually
be covered with silt, and thus concealed.
Mr. Livermore lives in Redding, Connecticut, which is subject to
considerable frost during the winter, but so far he has managed very

well with his birds in cold weather, as he has one or two heated houses
for the more tender species.
His collection at the present time numbers several hundred birds
with about forty-three forms of the Anseriformes , of which twenty are
geese, including four races of the Canada Goose family. Barnacles
and Bar-heads laid this year, and Indian Spot-bill Mallards&apos; among
others. Undoubtedly his new large enclosure will foster considerable
breeding activity next year, although he is still awaiting activity on the
part of his seven-odd pairs of Cereopsis Geese.
Two other collections in the eastern United States are those of
Mr. Jack Deeter, near Springfield, Mass., who obtained a considerable
amount of the Sibley collection, and the author. I have not heard
so far what Mr. Deeter has succeeded in raising, nor do I know his
place, but I believe he is an experienced aviculturist.
My own place has suffered from considerable neglect during the
war. The remains of my waterfowl collection were given to the New
York Zoo for the duration. No birds bred this spring, due to the
lateness of the season, when they were reinstated in my small pond.
Only one American Eider female, a seven-year-old bird, remains of
my former small flock. The rest of my birds are common or garden
species, with the exception of a pair of the nice little Cackling Geese,
the smallest of the Canada clan. I have a new pond enclosure with
about two acres of water in it, and am hoping to establish a regular
breeding stock of wild free-flying birds there in the Falloden tradition.
A pair of wild Wood Duck bred on it this spring and a number of
Black Duck feed there regularly.
In March this spring, when I was on a trip to see the waterfowl
refuges of Texas, my stock of captive duck received an unexpected
addition. On a small salt-water pond near the mouth of the Rio
Grande River I came on a single male Red-head Pochard feeding by
the bank. He flew away after he saw me, but made the mistake of
landing at the other end of the pond and hiding in the bushes. I caught
him in jig time. He was fat and in good condition, and I cannot
understand why he was not out on the open Laguna Madre with the
10,000 to 20,000 of his kind that winter there. I took him into the
town where I was staying and left him with an animal dealer. He
was placed in an old circus travelling cage for leopards, inhabited at
the time by a pair of ring doves, one of which was so taken aback that
it laid an egg on the spot. Leaving instructions for my Redhead to
be sent to me by air express after I had reached Connecticut by motor
in two weeks time, I left Texas with very little thought of ever seeing
my bird again. However, two weeks later, my drake arrived none
the worse for his captivity, and apparently completely recovered from
the illness or inferiority complex or whatever it was that forced him
out of his usual habitat that sunny March morning. Incidentally,

THE EIDER DUCK IN CAPTIVITY

Translated and reprinted from Aviornis, Encyclopedie international de
L'Elevage, No. 3, August, 1942, by permission of the Editor. (This
article was written by the late Dr. Derscheid during his imprisonment
in Brussels.)
Though many people know the name of Eider Duck as being (at
least in theory) the producer of the down which fills our eider-downs,
few of them have ever had the opportunity to see, and admire, this
bird, which is one of the largest and most beautiful of European
ducks, alive. Wild Eiders, it is true, only visit our regions infrequently
in the coldest winters in small numbers and they generally stay along
the coast or on the banks- of Bas-Escaut. But I have always been
astonished to note the complete absence of such an interesting and
famous species in bird collections of the Zoological Gardens I have
visited. The Eider is also conspicuous by its absence, apart from one
or two exceptions, in private waterfowl collections. The reason must
be the same in both cases ; that the method of keeping Eiders in good
condition in captivity for any length of time is not well known or not
sufficiently carefully carried out, and therefore I think it may be useful
to describe the treatment which a number of Eiders have received at
my rearing farm and which has in general kept them in excellent
condition.
Except in the regions where they are shot (which is rarely the case
in Northern Europe), Eiders are birds which are confiding by nature
and disposed to adapt themselves voluntarily to a state of semi-
domesticity, or rather to live and nest regularly in the immediate
proximity of men who content themselves by stealing the down from
their nests and sometimes some of their eggs. Under such conditions
the wild birds are emboldened to such an extent as to make their
nests in specially prepared sites, in stables and even in the interior of
buildings--it is so seen on a large scale in Iceland, where the exploita-
tion of eider-down has been a flourishing local industry for hundreds

of years ; the colonies of Eiders established in certain Frisian and
Danish islands and also in Scotland and Scandinavia are in a less
marked degree other examples of the confiding disposition of Eider
ducks to man. On account of this friendly temperament, it is not at all
difficult to induce Eiders to resign themselves to live in captivity. Even
the completely adult birds which we have received here almost
immediately after their capture have proved themselves to be relatively
tame and confiding within the space of only three or four days. As
early as the day of arrival I easily made them take their own food
(a very rare thing among the other sea ducks with the exception of the
Long-tailed Ducks). We have often noticed that as they get older, the
friendly and confiding dispositions of certain specimens are replaced
by aggressiveness towards man ; one of the most beautiful Eider drakes
which I have reared here became in 1940, at the age of 3 years, so
bold that every day he attacked the aviary attendant, who went into
his enclosure with his food, with strong pecks of his beak ; the artful
and vicious bird spitefully persisted in pecking above the edge of the
attendant's high protective boots.
The difficulty in the acclimatization of Eiders in collections is not
a matter of psychology but a matter of physiology ; their shortness of
life in captivity is due to the fact that they do not receive the necessary
treatment. The observations made by several of my friends and
myself on this subject have proved that these birds must have particular
care in three respects ; the quality of the water in their pond , the system
of habitual feeding , and their care during the moult.
Essentially sea-birds, Eiders nevertheless can accustom themselves
to live entirely in fresh water, but it is preferable that their pond should
have running water, continuous even if slow, which assures the constant
renewal of this water. It is no use to attempt to keep Eiders in good
health on an enclosed pool, and generally speaking on any stagnant
water, especially that which is too full of decaying vegetation. For
this reason, ponds with the bottom covered with dead leaves or black
slime, acid, and rich in methane are no good for them ; one can
succeed on the contrary in keeping them perfectly in pools with muddy
bottoms equally as well as in those of which the bottoms are of sand,
gravel stones, or concrete. Clear water is obviously desirable but it is
not a sine qua non for their maintenance in good health and Eiders live,
for example, equally well in the muddy water of our ponds with
clay bottoms as in the crystal-clear lakes where my friend Delacour
has reared them with success for a number of years at Cleres
(Normandy).
To ensure the purity of the water in a pond it is essential, as a
general rule, to avoid the fall of dead leaves, some of which (especially
poplar and sycamore) decompose rapidly, and quickly pollute the
water. It is useless to attempt to establish, for example, Eiders or

other marine ducks on a pond, the borders of which are planted to a
large extent with deciduous trees or shrubs ; evergreens such as
conifers, rhododendrons, laurels, etc., do not present the same
difficulty, they also drop their leaves, whatever is said to the contrary,
but the fall is far less simultaneous and pollution of near-by water is
hardly noticeable.
The maintenance of the purity, or rather the clarity of the water is
equally dependent on the state of the banks. It depends on the nature
of the banks as to whether the birds can or cannot destroy them by their
almost continual dabbling about on the edge. It is a good plan to
pave the area of the bank immediately above and below the normal
water-level with large pieces of irregular stone (if possible neatly
cemented together) ; this method (which we have adopted in several
of our ponds of sea-duck) is pre-eminently suitable for ponds on
clayey soil and of relatively small size. For large ponds and lakes
the method of strengthening the banks adopted at Cleres is very
satisfactory, in addition to being more economical. It consists of
covering the bank at a width of a metre (half below and half above the
water) with strips of turf on which is applied a piece of wire netting
with a small mesh (.11-15 mm.) firmly fixed in place by hooks in the
shape of hair-pins buried in the soil. The wire netting, which prevents
the undermining of the banks by the ducks and the falling in of parts
of the earth in bad weather is soon entirely hidden from view by the
grass which grows through the mesh.
The filtering of the water flowing into the pond is excellent in theory
for it keeps it limpid ; this method, however, is difficult to realize in
practice anywhere where filtering is made necessary by the influx of
extraneous matter floating in the water ; in this case the filter, what-
ever it may be, is soon choked up or dirty and does not remain
efficacious without frequent and thorough cleaning.
The kind of food suitable for Eiders is perhaps the most important
point in their care. As in many other cases, the chief difficulty arises
from the fact that the aviculturist (or his aviary attendant) does not
readily admit that what the birds eat with pleasure and even with
avidity is not necessarily what suits it best. As far as Eiders are con-
cerned, I must confess that it took many years and a good deal of
mortification to convince me that the principal fundamental of their
diet was to prevent Eiders, Scoters, Long-tailed Ducks, Harlequins,
in a word the true sea-ducks, from any access to whole or crushed
grains or to bran, and to take care not to mix them with fresh-water
ducks for which corn, buckwheat, dari, and maize are the normal
food. The sea-ducks in the wild state feed almost exclusively on
animal food such as molluscs, Crustacea, worms, and little fish.
A good deal of this animal food can be replaced in captivity by
food less rich (notably farinaceous food and albuminous vegetables),

but it is essential that in the mixture 20 to 30% of the whole food should
consist of ingredients such as good quality meat meal, fish meal, dried
shrimps, raw fish cut into small pieces, chopped meat, dried yeast, etc.
The remainder of the food can consist of preferably a good meal, well
sifted ; barley meal (with or without the addition of a third of maize
meal), having given us particularly good results, and being relatively
cheap in normal times. These various ingredients can be mixed into
a homogeneous paste with the addition of sufficient lukewarm water
to remain moist and compact without becoming sticky or glutinous.
At the time of the daily preparation two table-spoons of kitchen salt
(chlorate of sodium), one or two table-spoons of good cod-liver oil,
and one or two grammes of iodide of potassium or iodide of sodium
(which you can get from your chemist) should be added to each
kilogram of paste. Finally, at the last moment a good handful of a
mixture of gravel stones of the size of a pea, and crushed oyster shells
should be added to the paste and the lot given morning and evening
to your sea-ducks, in flat dishes at the side of the water. They will
then no longer have any excuse to waste away or die in the future as the
result of bad feeding.
In the system given abovp two points merit explanation, the
exclusion of bran in favour of sifted meal and the rejection of seeds
retaining their husks, and the regular addition of an iodine salt. The
two measures have the same objective, the prevention of the infectious
complaint most dangerous of all to aquatic or arctic birds from Eiders
and Albatrosses to Penguins, from Razorbills to Snowy Owls. . . .
I refer to aspergillosis or tracheo-pulmonary mycosis.
It is not possible to write at length of this injurious disease which
destroys so many valuable specimens every year both in Zoological
gardens and private collections. It is sufficient to state that it is caused
by the development in the internal cavities of the animal of a fungus
or mould, Aspergillus fumigatus , the reproductive spores of which are
found in myriads in normal state on the surface of grains of cereals,
straw and hay, etc. Because of the ubiquitousness of this fungus,
vegetarian or land-birds are normally immunized or insensible to its
attack and it is rarely that it develops pathologically. On the other
hand, the sea-ducks have no protection from its attacks, against which
they have nothing to guard them, for Aspergillus and its spores do not
exist in their natural habitat. The ill-omened cryptogam appears in
effect to be destroyed by the presence, even in small quantities, of
iodine or salts of iodine, which justifies the addition of iodide in the
food which we advocate. For the same reasons that we omit bran from
the food, a source of mass infection by spores of Aspergillus , it is
necessary to watch out that vegetable remains are not left to moulder
in any corner of the sea-ducks' enclosure, and if for some reason they
have to be shut up in a limited space they must not be given straw or

hay as litter, but if possible broken-up peat which is completely clean
and aseptic.
Concerning the feeding of Eiders and other sea-ducks, it only
remains to mention that it is advantageous in the case of large collec-
tions of several dozens of birds for example--to replace the mash of
which we have spoken by a sort of special bread of almost the same
composition, except that the 2/3 meal must be replaced by wheat or
rye meal which is less heavy and that the kitchen salt must be omitted
as it prevents the dough rising before baking. These special loaves,
containing thus about 25% of albuminous products are a complete
food, easily handled and can be kept in good condition for eight to
ten days, except in hot weather. We used them cut in pieces of
the size of a dice, this size being equally suitable for the largest
(Eiders and Goosanders) and for the smallest (Harlequins and
Buffle-heads) of the ducks to which the food was given. It is a good
thing to come to an arrangement with the local baker for the making
of this bread (the baking gives off a strong smell owing to the fish
meal) in order to assure delivery at regular intervals.
The preceding advice gives rise to the objection that in these
troublous times through which we are passing it is physically
impossible--and indeed illegal--to feed our birds in this way ; the
remark is pertinent and explains at the same time why the collections
of birds of this kind which were formed before the war at the price
of years of experience, often without result, and costly effort have
become obscured in the political storm. Our advice, we do not deny,
cannot be followed in a practical manner until the general situation
has returned to normal, particularly with regard to feeding. The
lessons learnt before the war and recorded in the present notes can
then be of interest and use.
We have referred at the beginning of this article to a third important
point with regard to Eiders in captivity--the critical period of the
moult. Is this because it takes place during the summer months that
the Eiders, adapted to live in arctic regions or in the fresh breezes of
the open sea suffer from an excess of heat or above all from a lack of
air ? It is always, as with the Scoters, also essentially marine ducks,
the most dangerous period of the year when mortality is highest even
among specimens perfectly acclimatized or born in captivity. It is
not rare at this season for them to refuse all food and to die after a few
weeks of misery, in a complete state of starvation and without having
renewed their feathers. The method of guarding against the dangerous
period is not easy to indicate, up to the present the most I can say is
that one must by all possible means encourage the birds to eat normally,
by ensuring that their food is always completely fresh and increasing
if necessary the number of daily meals, and by offering the food
for which the birds appear to have a preference or a special liking.

Sometimes little pieces of raw meat persuades them to wish to eat in
spite of their apathy. It is advisable in certain cases to " loosen " any
moult which appears to be retarded by pulling out half a dozen old
feathers from each of the wings and from the tail, repeating this
procedure two or three times at an interval of a few days.
The other large feathers--the most difficult to renew, then follow
these feathers in their fall--at least this is so in many cases.
I will mention in conclusion, certain peculiarities of the subject of
The head of the Eider has a very characteristic profile, the forehead extending
in a straight line along the ridge of the upper mandible. This is of a peculiar triangular
shape and it is remarkable that the feathered cheeks extend to a point between
the ridge and the edge of the beak in a way which is not found in any other group
of ducks. The large black eyebrows, the nape tinted with greenish-grey, and the
salmon-pink shade of the breast are the special characteristics of the adult male.

illustration. In this species the dimorphic sexual differences are very
marked, if not in size and build at least in the colouration of
the plumage. The female is entirely a beautiful chestnut brown,
striped transversely with black. As for the male, he has a magnificent
dress of velvety black, alternating with pure white ; contrary to what

has been observed in the majority of other birds, and equally in
animals in general, these two colours are so arranged in the general
scheme that the top of the body is almost entirely light and the under-
parts (with the exception of the throat) are all black. It is impossible
in the present stage of knowledge to offer a satisfactory explanation
of this abnormal type of colouration which is not imitated by any
other birds living in the same habitat and of about the same manner as
the Eiders.
The upper part of the head is adorned in the male Eider by two
broad bands, or eyebrows, of a beautiful, lustrous black, which divide
a narrow white line along the top of the head : it is near the lower
edge of these black bands but inside their area that the eyes are
placed ; they are equally black and for this reason almost invisible
at a short distance.
Certain authors (for instance M. Boubier, 1922) have even stated
that the eyes of the Eider are situated on the upper part of the head
and not laterally as in other ducks, and contends that this is a special
adaptation for diving so that the bird could continue to see what is
happening on the surface of the water. This theory is not confirmed
by an objective examination of the position of the organs in question,
further one cannot understand what use it could be for a diving duck
in search of food on the bottom that is to say below him to " keep an
eye 5 5 on the surface of the sea where he need not fear at that moment
the arrival of some enemy. Because of their heavy build and their
unusual strength, Eider ducks have in nature few adversaries or
enemies, except for man in countries such as Greenland, Alaska, and
Siberia.
One peculiarity of colouration worthy of mention in the Eider in
good health is the beautiful shade of salmon pink which replaces the
white, especially in spring, on the front of the chest. This rich shade
disappears in specimens which are feeble or ill, and often in those
which are kept in captivity ; this is also the case with the shade of
yellowish pink on the under parts of the Goosander (Mergus merganser)
in captivity. This is a matter, as our experience has proved, of a lack
in the food, very probably a lack of vitamins (perhaps above all
vitamin C, which the birds normally find in large numbers in the flesh
of mussels and other marine life). The same loss of colour of the tone
of the yellow-pink-reds is to be seen in Flamingoes, Scarlet Ibises, etc.,
kept in captivity and the researches carried on in certain Zoos in the
U.S.A. have proved that these birds keep their colour best if they are
fed principally on fresh shrimps and other live food.
In our experience with the feeding described above, we have
succeeded for many years in keeping the good colours of the male
Eiders and up to a certain point that of the male Goosanders
although these seem to lose colour much more easily. I must also

mention the characteristic " greeny grey " colour of area in the
nape of the neck of the male Eider, which only appears on adult birds
in good health. The male Eiders do not acquire their full plumage till
the third year and it is only then that one sees the feathers above the
wing called " sickles 55 becoming long and tapering and curving out-
wards above the primaries--this characteristic determines whether
a bird is a young or adult male. The females of all ages have a similar
plumage to young birds of less than a year old, but of a warmer and
deeper brown.
Eiders are sociable with their own species and inoffensive towards
other waterfowl.

By D. S. Wintle
I have been asked to submit an article on waterfowl. As I have had
little to do with these birds during the past seven years I cannot think
of anything better than to write, in a general sort of way, about the
Walcot Waterfowl collection as it was in days gone by.
Walcot Park, once known to many naturalists, contains three large
and beautiful lakes on which lived one of the finest collections of water-
fowl ever assembled in our islands. I regret to say that nothing much
remains of this collection to-day--a few hybrid geese, a pair of Emperor
Geese, a small flock of Canadian Geese, one Buffle Headed drake, and
a flock of Mandarins which maintain themselves in a wild state.
Mr. Ronald Stevens who, with his brother Mr. Noel Stevens, owned
this collection, was always keen to introduce to the lakes new species
of duck. I remember receiving one year about 30 Pigmy Geese,
20 Hottentot Teal, 15 White-backed Duck, 20 Gape Teal, and a
number of South African Red Billed Duck, all of which reached this
country in very good condition. The Pigmy Geese, little yellow-
billed creatures patterned in shining green and orange-brown, and
shaped much like Garolinas, were placed in a glass-house when first
they arrived. We fed them on millet and for a few weeks they flourished.
Quite suddenly they developed warts on the head and bill and then
they started to die like flies. In desperation we turned them loose on a
sheltered pond, thinking that more natural conditions might save a
small number of them. However, all of them died.

D. S. WINTLE MEMORIES OF WATERFOWL AT WALGOT 1 8 1
The Hottentot Teal proved hardy little birds and several pairs
nested. They were not prolific breeders for the ducks made a habit of
laying two eggs and then showing no further interest in their domestic
duties. On one occasion only did a pair produce a full clutch of eight
eggs. The nest was always made close to the water's edge where
grasses and wild flowers grew thickly. Hottentot Teal are probably
the smallest duck in the world and as such their eggs are tiny and their
ducklings minute. They were not difficult to rear, provided one chose
for their foster mother a small and light-footed bantam.
The fat, dumpy little White-backed Duck, mottled yellowish brown
and dark brown, stub-billed and short-tailed, were hardy enough
but they were very stupid. The first winter they spent at Walcot was
unfortunately a severe one, and for long periods at a time the lake
on which they lived was frozen over, except for one or two small
areas of open water. Being diving duck, they would go off on a sub-
marine search for food, forgetting all about the ice, in consequence
many were drowned. Two drakes realized the danger of being trapped
under the ice and these two lived for many years.
Both the Gape Teal and African Red-billed Duck adapted themselves
to the English climate, they bred fairly readily and their young were
easy to rear.
North American Ruddy Duck, one pair of which we obtained from
Mr. Sibley's duck farm in America proved a great success. We found
them easy to keep and they were in no way upset by their journey
across the Atlantic. The drake, with his Cambridge blue beak, black
cap, white cheeks, brick-red body, and long spiny tail was always
admired by visitors to Walcot. No species of duck is better suited to
small garden ponds, particularly as fencing is not needed to keep
them at home. They are clumsy on land and dislike walking.
Moreover, they quickly become tame. The pair we had bred freely,
and the ducklings were not difficult to rear artificially. If all domestic
arrangements were left to the parent birds I imagine that every
duckling would have a first rate chance of reaching maturity. A
strange feature about this species is the size of its egg. Though the
Ruddy Duck is approximately two-thirds the size of a Tufted Duck
its egg is considerably larger than that of a Mallard.
I do not think Musk Duck have been brought over to England on
many occasions. Late in 1938, we imported two specimens from
Australia. These reached us in a deplorable state, their feathers
were dry, dirty, and smashed, the skin on their legs and bills was
cracked and&apos;scabbed. However, they had in their dark little eyes a
look of determination. For a while we kept them in a stable bedded
with peat moss and fed them on raw shredded beef and biscuit meal.
Both had grand appetites and sloshed up their food like hungry
pigs. Soon they began to wax fat, and then a long overdue moult

commenced. When their new feathers began to show \ye turned
them lopse on a small pond. A few weeks later they looked spick and
span in their new tightly feathered dress of dark pepper and salt colour.
New skin grew over their heavy black bills, which now shone like the
toe-caps of guardsmen's boots. We did not pinion them because we
thought they would never manage to rise off their small, enclosed
pond, their wings were so small and ineffective in appearance.
Unfortunately one night they both scuttled over their pond, making
loud smacking noises with their large, webbed feet, both became air-
borne and they were away. One crashed into a wire netting fence
near the lakes and was caught. The other was never seen or heard of
again. I believe these two Musk Duck were females for they developed
no chin wattle or pouch, nor did they ever smell of musk.
Every spring we received a large consignment of Harlequin eggs
from Iceland. Mr. Ronald Stevens gave these his special attention,
and after conducting experiments concerning the correct feeding of
Harlequin ducklings he finally concluded that maggots formed the
ideal diet. Thus we made many unpleasant journeys to slaughter
yards collecting trailer loads of odious offal. This filth was placed in
a structure known as the " Maggotorium ", which quickly became a
murmurous haunt of flies, wasps, and other scavenging insects. As
the maggots ripened, prior to pupation, they dropped from the offal
on to a sanded tray from which Mr. Stevens shovelled them into
buckets--brave man !--no one else would go near the Maggotorium.
Undoubtedly the young Harlequins loved maggots, they would
wolf a whole bucket of them in next to no time. Harlequin ducklings
are extremely difficult to rear and the fact that about nine reached a
fully fledged state out of 50 or 60 hatched will give some idea of
Mr. Stevens's achievement to others who have attempted to rear this
species. No Harlequin Duck which we reared lived for more than
2 |years and the longest time we ever kept a drake was 18 months.
This drake had just moulted into full adult breeding plumage when he
died, a creature of amazing beauty.
Like other birds, waterfowl have very definite individualities
though, generally speaking, they confirm to a code of behaviour
peculiar to their own particular species. I can, however, recall one
or two exceptions.
At one time there lived on the lakes a wild Common Teal drake
which attached itself to a pair of Carolina Wood Duck. No matter
where the Carolinas went the Teal accompanied them. He sat with
them on chimney pots, roof tops, on fences, and on the branches of
trees. When the Carolinas went searching for nesting sites in spring-
time he would often take the initiative in exploring suitable holes in
trees. One day, I received a message from a farmer's wife asking me
to collect a duck which had landed in her sitting-room fireplace,

having come down the chimney. On my arrival at the farm, I was
presented with a bag in which was the little Teal drake. I released
him and he was soon back with the Carolinas.
Then there was the discovery that female Andean Geese will, if
encouraged, show a preference for human company over that of their
own kind. We had a goose which would follow us about like a dog,
she loved too to be stroked and tickled under the chin and on the
cheek. She was gentle, well behaved and much liked by children,
who always asked if they might take her home. Without doubt,
Andean Geese would become popular pets in this country if they could
be readily obtained at a reasonable price. The purchaser would,
however, have to make sure he did not take home a gander by mistake.
I know of no species of goose, the gander of which is more fierce.
These snorting, puffed-up creatures make no idle threats as do farm-
yard ganders. An Andean Gander will come straight at you from a
distance of several hundred yards and in a few moments you'll have
your legs thrashed by his powerful wings.
The lakes at Walcot are silent now. The witch-like laughter of
Common Shelducks no longer echoes over the water nor does one hear
the intermittent coo of Eider drakes. No Carolinas cry to the moon
or use their musical note to enhance the sacred atmosphere of autumn.
Once the home of more than 125 species of ducks, geese, and swans,
the lakes have been handed back to their old tenants, Mallard, Coot,
and Moorhens.

STRANGE NESTING BEHAVIOUR OF A
WHITEFRONTED GANDER

The fascination of studying the breeding habits of wild geese certainly
lies much in the unexpected vagaries of individuals. In the last
waterfowl number of the Avicultural Magazine (1945, p. 105),
I mentioned unusual nesting behaviour at Tayfield, Fife, on the part
of a Whitefronted Gander--behaviour which has since been even more
remarkably repeated.
In 1943, the Whitefronted Gander paired with an old Greylag
Goose whose previous mate, a Greylag, like herself, had died some years
before. The Greylag Goose nested in 1944 with the Whitefronted
Gander as her devoted companion. But he did not guard her nest
in a manner usual for the ganders of his own, or of any other species of
geese ; indeed, he did not behave like a gander at all, for he made
another nest for himself as close to the Greylag's as she would permit
and sat on his nest as if he were also a female incubating eggs.
In due course the Greylag hatched three goslings. These were
not hybrids with the Whitefronted, but " foster-children "--a pure-
bred Whitefronted Gosling and two Snow-x-Greylag hybrids. When
the goslings left the nest, the Whitefronted Gander led and defended
the brood in a normal masculine way and the family party remained
together until the following April.
When I visited the goose fields on 8th May, 1945, the three young
geese were feeding with other non-breeding immatures. After a
short search, I discovered the Greylag on a nest in the remains of
an old straw stack. On a similar nest almost touching hers, and
behaving in a precisely similar feminine manner, was the Whitefronted
Gander. As in the previous season, he made no attempt to drive off
other geese which came near, but merely sat tight on his nest, stretching
out his neck close to the ground and hissing softly--behaving, in fact,
just as the female Greylag did. Also nesting in the scattered straw*
undisturbed and apparently unnoticed by the two geese, were a
Pheasant and a domestic fowl from a nearby hen-run.
My next visit was on 26th May. The Greylag, for whom the straw
provided a comparatively limitless supply of ideal nesting material,
had made a huge nest, or rather mound of straw, on top of which she
was comfortably established. The Whitefronted Gander was sitting
on a more modest nest beside that of his mate. Both the Pheasant
and the hen had disappeared and not much was left of their nests.
It happened that I had in my hand a Barnacle's egg which I had
just picked up at the bottom of a bank where a colony of these geese

were nesting. Remembering how the Whitefronted had, in the previous
season, taken eggs from his mate's nest while she was absent from it
and had sat on them himself, I put the Barnacle's egg on the ground
near the nest and retired to watch his reactions. For about two
minutes he contemplated the egg without moving. He then rose
slowly from his nest, walked to the Barnacle's egg and without hesita-
tion began to dribble it towards his nest, walking backwards and
skilfully keeping the egg rolling between his feet with the underside
of his bill* The Greylag was much interested in this proceeding ;
she craned her neck&apos;out of her nest and there was much low muttering
between them. The gander got the egg into his nest and sat down
on it, but the goose leaned out of her nest and poked her bill under
him, at which he stood up again. After some further " talk ", the
gander rolled the egg out of his nest and the goose helped him with her
bill to work it up the pile of straw into her own nest. She stood up
to push the egg under her, and I saw that her nest contained some if
not all the Pheasant's and hen's eggs as well as a full clutch of six
goose eggs.
In order to test whether there was any size limit to the eggs which
these two geese would collect, we returned later that evening with a
very large white Rhea's egg which we left a couple of yards from the
nests. The Whitefronted behaved just .as he had with the Barnacle's
egg. Without great difficulty he managed to trundle the big egg
into his nest and tried to sit on it. He sat on top of it, and rolled off
forwards ; he tried again, and the egg came out sideways. For several
minutes he kept on trying to sit on the egg, the Greylag watching him
keenly and muttering continuously. At last he gave it up and sat down
at the edge of his nest with the big egg against his breast. The Greylag
stepped from her nest and rolled the Rhea's egg up into it most skil-
fully. The Whitefronted made no attempt to assist her. One could
imagine that she was telling him how inefficient he was ; he looked
quite crestfallen. The goose sat down on her nest, moving the big egg
over to her side ; she appeared to be working a place for it under her
with her feet. Soon she had completed the task and rose slightly to
tuck the egg below her, it rolled into place easily. She fluffed out her
flank feathers and pulled straw up round her with her bill, successfully
covering all the eggs. But she was so obviously uncomfortable that
I decided to remove the Rhea's egg and also some of the other eggs
in hopes that she would then have a better chance of incubating
and hatching her own. I found that the Rhea's egg was in the centre
of the nest, deeply sunk in the straw ; the other eggs were closely
packed round it, the hen's and Pheasant's eggs at the outside with the
tops of all the eggs level.
The following afternoon we tried one more experiment with this
pair of geese. I wanted to know whether they would discriminate

between an egg of whatever size and an egg-like object of different
shape and texture. So, from some yards, I rolled a golf ball toward
the straw nests.
The Whitefronted eyed the ball for some minutes before he rose
from his nest and walked over to examine it. He touched the ball
with his bill and it rolled about a foot straight away from him. This
seemed to surprise him considerably, and the Greylag was also much
interested. The gander walked to the ball and inspected it cautiously
from all angles, he then suddenly opened his bill very wide and tried
to pick the ball up in it. He could not quite achieve this, so dribbled
the ball to the straw pile, walking backwards and keeping the ball
rolling between his feet with his bill, as he had done with the eggs.
On this occasion he did not take it to his own nest, but worked it
up the straw to the Greylag's nest where his mate examined it closely.
She moved it about with her bill and then rejected it without making
any effort to put it under her. Finally she pushed it away and it
rolled down the straw heap. The Whitefronted collected it from
there and took it into his own nest where I left him sitting on it.
Next morning the golf ball had disappeared. I found it five weeks
later in the Greylag's nest with her six rotten eggs which she had by
then deserted. The geese themselves had been rejoined by the foster-
children--the Whitefronted and the two " Snowlags ", and the family
party kept together for the rest of the year.
Visiting Tayfield in March, 1946, I found that the t; children "
had gone off on their own. The Whitefronted, a female, had paired
with a Pinkfooted Gander fifteen years older than herself; the " Snow-
lags " were a male and a female and I had hoped that they would
breed together and perhaps produce a fertile race new to science.
But the male was flying about with a flock of Barnacles with one of
which he subsequently mated, and the female had paired with her
own father, an elderly Lesser Snow, with whose help she later hatched
a fine brood of five rather beautiful double hybrids. On 18th May,
the Whitefronted and the Greylag were again nesting on the identical
spots they had occupied in 1945. Most of the straw had become
scattered during the winter, and the Greylag had collected almost
all that was left, so while she had quite a large nest, the Whitefronted
was sitting on little more than bare ground. This year there were no
Pheasants or hens nesting near whose eggs the geese could steal,
and we spared them the diversion of any further experimental sub-
stitutes. On 4th June, they left their nests with four hybrid goslings
whom the gander led and defended in all circumstances in an entirely
normal masculine manner of which any mother goose might well
be proud.

By H. H. Davis, M.B.O.U.
The following account, describing briefly what was perhaps the
most exciting days goose-watching ever enjoyed in these Islands,
may be regarded as supplementary to an article, in the Waterfowl
issue of the Avicultural Magazine for July-August, 1945, concerning
the large numbers of wild geese that winter annually on the New
Grounds, at Slimbridge, in Gloucestershire.
On 16th December, 1945, four observers--Lieut.-Commander
Peter Scott, Messrs. Clive Wilson and John Winter, and the writer,
visited this famous haunt to find the geese in great strength and grazing
quietly on their favourite saltmarsh. This 200-acre marsh is flanked
by the Severn on one side and by an extensive floodbank on the
other. Overlooked by four concrete pillboxes, conveniently spaced
out along the floodbank, it offers better facilities for close-up observa-
tion than are to be had in any other haunt.
On our arrival many of the geese were feeding only 200 yards out
from the floodbank, while a few were considerably nearer. With a
little judgment and a good deal of luck we managed to crawl into a
pillbox without the birds being any the wiser, and once inside were
rewarded with uninterrupted views over the marsh. Sprawled across
it, thickly in some places and thinly in others, were not less than 2,000
geese.
In a light as good as it can be on a December morning we began,
with binoculars and a telescope, a careful survey of the various flocks
and at once found, as we expected to find, that the great majority
were White-fronts. Here and there amongst the huge gathering, how-
ever, were little parties of Pink-feet--perhaps seventy birds in all.
Our attention was soon drawn to a Bean-Goose, an immature bird,
with a typically segetum type bill, feeding with the White-fronts
nearest at hand, and looking strikingly dark alongside its paler com-
panions. Training our glasses further afield, we searched for a
Barnacle which we knew had been there during the past few weeks.
Although much less conspicuous amongst the grey geese than one
would suppose, it soon came to view and was sufficiently close for us
to see that it too was an immature bird.
An hour had passed when attention was focused on a compact
little goose amongst a party of White-fronts on the north side of the
pillbox. To our astonishment it proved to be an adult example of that
very scarce visitor to Britain--the Lesser White-front. 1 Compared
1 The only fully authenticated previous records of the Lesser White-fronted
Goose (A. erythropus) in the British Isles are those of an immature bird shot in
Northumberland in September, 1886, and of an adult seen in Lincolnshire in
January, 1943 {The Field, nth December, 1886, and 18th August, 1945). Several
other records are regarded as doubtful (cf. Handbook of British Birds, vol. iii, p. 191).

with its companions, the bird looked darker and smaller, while its
shape and carriage seemed altogether more delicate. Its generally
neater and smoother appearance was, no doubt, accentuated by the
short neck and legs, and by the light edges of the mantle feathers being
narrower and less prominent than in most grey geese. The bright
pink--almost coral pink--bill was noticeably small, thus giving the
head, which was much darker than in typical albifrons , a somewhat
rounded effect. When viewed head-on, the white blaze on the forehead
looked narrower than the usual blaze of the Common White-front,
and it extended well up between the eyes. Most important, however,
of the field-characters noted were the swollen, golden-yellow eyelids
which were seen clearly by all four observers. Watching this
delightful goose and its larger relatives as they grazed slowly to within
i oo yards range, we suddenly realized that there was also an immature
Greylag amongst the party. This, in marked contrast to the dark
looking Bean, was a very pale bird. We had just commented on its
bright, orange-yellow bill when, as if to help in establishing its identity,
this latest addition to our list for the day obligingly unfolded a wing
to show us the conspicuously blue-grey shoulder.
After what had been a thrilling three hours we moved, under cover
of the floodbank, to a pillbox lower down the salting. From there we
examined another flock some 400 yards out, and almost immediately
identified what was undoubtedly a second adult Lesser White-front.
Again the delicate shape and carriage were noted, while the
characteristic white blaze, even more extensive than that of the first
bird, went right to the top of the head. Despite the longer range we
were just able, with telescope, to get an occasional glimpse of the
golden-yellow eyelids. Whereas the first bird was probably a female,
this one, by its behaviour and the more extensive white blaze, was
almost certainly a male. While it was still under review yet another
species--a Brent, of the dark-breasted form--was seen with a large
pack of White-fronts close in to the floodbank. As with the Barnacle,
the Greylag, and the Bean, this also was quite evidently a bird of the
\0x25A0year.
We had now obtained excellent views of no less than seven species
on this one goosemarsh, and had had the additional satisfaction of
finding, for the first time in the annals of bird-watching in these
Islands, all five species of the British grey geese together. Truly a
remarkable day !

Even the air is not what it was, more and more secrets make it their
speedtrack ; so that the birds cannot evade the fact that they are so
many solid bodies more or less suspended in the atmosphere, and
therefore liable to be impinged upon, if they do not themselves
impinge. One poor Swan, one dark night of expectation, bent only
on a personal affair in the west, made strange contact with a cluster
of semi-human looking figures on a certain hill-top below, like glow-
worms round some obscure nucleus of attraction ; and four great
gun barrels, out of the abyss, came nosing round on a hot scent ;
but that happened in Scotland, so---
To readers who enjoyed Mr. Delacour's account of the Trumpeter
Swan in the U.S.A., some account of its near relations may be
acceptable, how they came to County Derry and winter quarters in
Forty-two and three.
One expected the clangour of the first wild geese in the sky any night
at the end of September, but it was another month before the wild
Swans began to reach Lough Foyle. Meanwhile, the Mute Swans had
been gathering together from their summer haunts until, in the place
I am writing of, there were sometimes nearly a hundred. This is one
of a string of ponds just inside a seawall, that protects a mile or two of
fields won from the bottom of the Lough along its southern shore.
This lake-like water at the western end, next the River Faughan, must
be deeper than the others and contain a good growth of zostera
grass, on which the Mutes and the visitors live throughout the winter,
with a few out of the many Wigeon and some Tufted duck. I think
some of the Mutes came from a distance, possibly from " abroad ",
but know of no concrete evidence and would not raise a gun to procure
it. That was the great beauty of the place, there was no shooting,
unless you count an occasional " Air Force bloke" with a gun in the
distance, whose only effect was to make distant birds come nearer.
The whole was a natural sanctuary for ducks and waders to come
and go, and even the Greylags were getting used to the ways of
aeroplanes ; mostly the birds ignored any but the lowest stunts. A
Flamingo spent one whole winter here some years ago. My reason
for regarding some of the Mutes as possible migrants is that one day,
it was 24th October, 1942, I witnessed the arrival of nine from the
east, flying in the perfect V formation I associate with long-distance
flights, or at least a change of locality. Strangford Lough is also a
great resort of the Mutes. The leader was two swan lengths in front
of the arms of the V.

It was the very next day there came a rhythmical honking from
high in the sky ; not the gabble of geese, but wild Swans passing inland
on a south-westerly course, already distant where the Derry barrage
balloons were dimmed by haze. They flew in a V with an extra
Swan in the lead, well in front of the pointer, and showed a cold,
ghostly white through the warm purplish ground haze. One of those
marvellous still days in N.I. that set the spiderlings aloft on the sun's
warmth, and the Rooks rebuilding ; when the sky is a vast blue shade
over a crystal, set in huge cumulus clouds, immovably embedded in
haze behind the circle of hills. Only towards evening the clouds
soften and swell and the falling sun glares at the still monotony of the
rain.
The wings of Mute Swans sing their own droning accompaniment,
but these were Cygni cygni , Whooper Swans, on the high migration
skyway, plying silent wings to an air chanty in an age-old tongue--
honqu-ha, honqu-ha, honqu-ha--Do the honks time their wing
strokes and the short second syllables the recovery--of wings and
breath ?
These first comers were in the whiteness of maturity, or at least of
their second winter. Cygnets began to come a few days later, but
always accompanied by adults, presumably parents. Several points
of interest make it worth while to give details. There were Whoopers
already on the lake in a great assembly of Mutes, as their two syllable
calls could be heard now and then in spite of an easterly wind. Five
Swans abreast came flying low from the east and honkaed as they came;
they let down their undercarriages, small and neat compared with
the huge paddles of Mutes, lowered their necks and came down on
bent wings ; but heads and wings went up as they struck the water
on the adjoining pond. Two snowy parents and three young in pale,
smudgy sepia. The yellow on the bills of the old birds, that dis-
tinguishes both Whooper and Bewick Bwans from Trumpeters, and
adds greatly to their beauty, was bright and deep, but those parts in
the young were dull reddish orange, more like Mutes. The cob in
front raised himself in the shallow water to scan the neighbourhood.
A second flight of eight came over the seawall and turned west, dipping
out of sight behind it to reappear in the gap made by a creek, in line
ahead ; evenly spaced except for the one in front who had a distinct
lead. They went behind the wall again and were next seen at the far
end of the Swan lake, now eleven strong, where they swung back on to
the water in a line ; the leader first, then three some distance behind,
the newcomers I supposed, a pair with one young bird ; but the other
seven carried overhead and alighted well in front, first two old birds
then five young in line behind. That may have been the correct
drill, or perhaps the trio upset it. They came honking and were greeted
by their fellow Whoops among the Mutes.

J. F. M. FLOYD-THE WILD SWANS OF ERIN 1 9 1
Five young, if all their own, seemed a fine family to bring from the
far north. The family parties kept together and apart ; Mutes and
Whoopers never take any notice of each other. But a pair of Mutes
were often to be seen with no less than seven offspring ! No mix up.
I once saw a stranger try to join that imposing procession. The cob,
in the van, arched his wings, the pen coming third, slim on the water,
arched hers a little and turned out toward the oncomer ; that was
enough for him, or her.
The wild Swans lack the superb carriage of the tame ; they cannot
build triumphal arches of their wings and their necks go straight up,
or lean back at the base when at ease, never cast in imposing curves ;
but the yellow on their brows is fairer than gold, and they have their
own slender elegance and a wild look, although wild mainly in name.
In this part of Ireland, at any rate, they neither expect the Vandal
nor meet him.
There rose now and then a murmur of conversation in a low version
of the same two syllables, hearing which the first family approached
and left their pond with less effort and with a shorter run than Mutes
could. Their wings at first made a swishing sound but this was soon
hidden in the rhythm of their honking. That is surely functionally
related to the " wing-music " of the Mutes, and both, say, to the
timed beat of paddles on the gunwales of long canoes bound on the
endless gold trail. They crossed over to the Swan lake in line, parents
first, but one youngster overtook and passed them, a thing, I imagine,
could only happen on a short flitting like this. They swung round above
the crowd and took the water in line abreast.
Three adult Whoopers climbed the bank with the aid of their wings,
not too awkwardly, and stood on top to take a survey. Having folded
their wings they settled matters with one sideways waggle of the tail.
The leader, whom every swannish occasion would seem to produce,
descended to the grassy flat and after a few steps stood at gaze, neck
upright ; the other two followed. Then only three heads appeared
from a dip in the ground, and one skyward stern replaced a head,
then another ; sometimes three sterns were in the air as three swans
up-ended in some hidden water. On the lake both species were feeding
and up-ending, dragging up trailers of the weed to eat on the surface.
About four o'clock two groups went away silently, a seven and then
a ten, across the river and then over the Foyle and the low hills beyond,
not rising much to clear farmsteads and trees, over the spire of Culmore
church where the balloon barrage was just going up out of some tree
clumps ; with nothing to fear and heedless of frontiers, but not keeping
to their original formations. Three forged ahead, and a single bird,
perhaps the Captain of the Eleven, left those behind and tried to
overtake some in front ; wrong drill somewhere ? More Swans lifted
and joined in from the unseen Faughan and the Foyle. I watched the

last group in line abreast draw away over the tree tops, but they
seemed stationary for an age ; how one's arms ached holding up the
binoculars ! At a great distance they shone dimly white when their
topsides caught the sun, or all turned dark in a shadow against the
brightness in the west. When a rain-squall crossed the Border and the
setting sun warmed the grey of the clouds, and the Donegal hills
made a flat tone of light in the falling mist, the Swans all turned blue
over there, deep ultramarine. At the last moment the line rose a
little, now far beyond the last ridge, and went behind a clump of
trees on the crest.
Galway Bay, Donegal Bay, Lough Swilly, sure 'tis the melody of
suchlike names that lures them on and on, not a memory or legend of
bellyfuls of #ostera marina ! But some remained, a family party of
six and others ; a pair of adults could almost be called winter residents,
they were often lying on top of the bank or preening or grazing.
During November and December, there might be as many as seventeen
Whoopers, mostly adults, never unattached young. Sometimes they
got together in the middle and dipped and lifted their heads to a
great blowing of trumpets, spreading and beating their wings or half
raising them in a winnowing motion.
A line of thirteen came through the foot of a rainbow, on a day of
rainbows, where it showed against the looming bastions of Binevenagh
in the north-east. Their calling was not the full cry of two syllables,
but a murmur of single nasal notes related to it. Three broke away and
returned east but the others held on into the distance. The line
changed direction when every Swan turned at once, which brought
them line abreast, but when they came to some distant division of the
way they wheeled together right about and went off to the left.
The Bewicks, Cygnus hewickii bewickii , began soon after the New
Year. Alongside Mutes and the pair of Whoopers, they were obviously
much smaller, comparatively cobby. I never saw Whoopers any
distance from big water, but a flock of Bewicks, as many as twenty-five,
like a flock of geese, were often grazing in the flats, on stubbles where
the stooks had only just been gathered and where the only water was
in ditch and flooded furrow, out of which some necks stuck up and
only the tops of backs could be seen. Among them were seven immature
birds, without discernible family ties, of an attractive pale sepia,
affected by blueish sky reflection. At times a very low moaning could
be heard, composed of a repeated hod. They were confident and
took no notice of passing humans. When not feeding in the fields
they were probably out on the Lough, as I never saw more than a
few about the ponds. In fact, I saw them there in February of '42,
but at too great a range to be certain.
This was on the road to Limavady. About twenty Brent geese
were grazing on a favourite field of short turf next the shore. Beyond

were twenty-six Swans, snow white on the very blue water of the
Lough, one or two in their first winter. They all had their necks up
and were full of suspicion, rather short necks and shortish bodies,
very like white domestic geese ; they worked their heads up and
down from time to time but were about a mile out of hearing. They
cruised on and off for a long time, wanting to land but sheering
off after each approach. In the end they worked out into the Lough
and rose in two groups of twelve and fourteen, flying off into the sea-
like distance in opposite directions : " one behind another, looking
like a streaming white ribbon."
The Mutes began to disappear, until there were only thirty in
mid-February, and by the end of March only a dozen. My latest

This season has been a good one for the young waterfowl, if only
we had had a decent stock of breeding birds, but as several of our
birds were adults in 1939 and none have been replaced the remnants
are inclined to be aged and infirm, widows or widowers. Of birds
smaller than a Shelduck, only four pairs survived, and fortunately the
Puna Teal were amongst the four, the others being a pair of Cape
Teal, a pair of Mandarin, and a pair of Tufted. The other odds were
a female Red-crested Pochard, so infirm and ancient that on land she
can walk no better than a Grebe, a female Canvasback of the same
age, a female American Wigeon, a male Chiloe Wigeon, two male
Falcated and two male Lesser Scaup. The London Zoo most kindly
lent us a male Red-crested Pochard, from that pair thirty young
birds have been reared ; a male American Wigeon which died, so
our duck laid in vain ; and a female Falcated which was very poor
and did not lay. The old Canvasback laid and then decided to seek
a mate amongst the immortals.
The Mandarin laid seven eggs, five hatched, but three vanished

mysteriously when about three weeks- old, the two survivors I hope
will be females. The Tufted laid eight eggs ; eight hatched and one
has been lost. So much for the more common species, if any to-day
can be called common.
The Puna Teal which were brought over in 1939 by Mr. Alastair
Morrison are, I believe, the only pair in captivity. This little South
American is like a large edition of the Versicolor Teal, the chief
difference being that the Puna lacks the Versicolor's beak patch, the
beak being self pale blue in the Puna with a dark nail. The female, of
course, is similar to the male, head black to a line just below the eye,
throat and cheeks pale cream, body very finely vermiculated black and
grey, the pencilling being coarser on the sides of the tail and upper
rump. The duck has a light brown cast over her grey. This duck has
laid several clutches each year, but during the war years none were
reared.
This year the duck has had four nests, the first hidden in dead
herbage amongst growing nettles. Six eggs were laid, pale cream,
very similar to those of a Wigeon in size, incubation 25 days. Four
ducklings were hatched ; these ducklings were similar to those of a
young Mallard, but the down colour is a drab grey and silver grey.
One hung itself on the hen's feathers and three, two ducks and a
drake, have reached maturity. They proved fairly easy to rear on
biscuit meal, egg, and insects. Nervous to start with, they became
exceedingly tame and have not the slightest objection to being
handled, are a menace amongst one's feet, I trod on one when feeding
them but by good luck simply trapped it in the instep. The young
drakes can be sexed on feathering by the clearer pencilling of the rump
and tail sides, females being simply drab. The young females also
show some little black spots at the base of the bill as do most Mallards,
Pintails, Teal, etc. From the second nest six young were hatched and
six have been reared, from the third six were hatched and five are
now beginning to feather, from the fourth nest none have yet hatched,
but four eggs are fertile.
The Cape Teal have very little sex difference except in size. Both
sexes have plumage of a very pale silver grey, mottled, as in a female
Mallard or Pintail, with a darker grey ; their beaks are pink, shading
to bluish mauve at the base and edges, their eyes and tempers fiery.
In the spring they went into a full moult as they always do and I
did not expect any eggs till late summer. However, the duck started
laying as soon as her flights were full grown. Six eggs were laid, well
concealed in a tuft of grass on a steep bank. The eggs are cream and
considerably smaller than those of the Puna Teal, but larger than
Common Teal. Incubation is 24 to 26 days and the young have typical
duckling markings, but are in the same two shades of pale grey as
are the adults. Three were hatched in the first brood, but two died,

three again were hatched in the second and two have been reared.
The old birds I then thought had finished laying, but at the time of
writing, 28th July, the duck is laying again, six eggs so far. The first
feather of the young has a slightly brown shade in the grey.
Ruddy Shelduck consist of a sixteen-year-old female and a male
of about seven years. This female has now a head as white as that of a
female New Zealand Shelduck ; five young were hatched and reared
from eight eggs. Australian laid eight, five hatched and a pair were
reared ; the young female, however, died of crop binding. The
Australian is reported to be less savage than most of the family, but
our male was a terror. The nest was in a box in the branches of a
willow. Rajah bred in 1940, when about a dozen were reared, but
no eggs were laid till this year, by which time the flock had dwindled
to two birds. The pair showed signs of breeding a long time before any
eggs were laid, both birds displayed a great deal and in the evenings
spent a lot of time hunting worms. For their food they do not wander
about searching in the evenings as do most duck. They choose their
beat to which they regularly return, evening after evening, or when-
ever it is wet during the day. The pair always worked very close
together and were amusing to watch. Having arrived at the spot, they
marked time exceedingly rapidly for a quarter or even half a minute
and then, without moving their feet, peered about till they spotted a
foolish worm breaking the surface. Having smartly snaffled him
the spotter returned to its mate and the pair started marking time
again. A quiet dialogue is kept up most of the time, particularly during
the periods when they are spotting the suckers. I have often seen them
working and passed by half an hour later to find them within a yard
of their original spot. The technique seems to work really well and
their bag, I'm sure, is larger by far than that of the wandering
searcher. The next stage was a tour of inspection of the various boxes.
The female climbed the ladders and peered suspiciously through the
entrance holes while the male generally stayed below. In this they
were not in the least secretive. This went on for some time without
getting the pair apparently any further, but suddenly the female
started feeding up and that, of course, invariably means business.
Eight eggs were laid, white or rather very slightly tinted cream,
highly glossed and rather rounded. The duck showed no desire to sit.
She died before going into eclipse. Incubation is thirty days, and there
were five young hatched and reared. The down plumage is the same
as the rest of the family in design, in this case the colours are black
and white, but the cap is brilliant chestnut. The first plumage is very
similar to the adult, but although the beak and legs are flesh white,
as in the adult, the iris is dark.
The Red-breasted geese paired up in a rather strange manner,
there were two trios, one pair and an odd gander. Only one goose is

as far as I know hand-reared, and she laid ten eggs, from which we
have reared nine goslings. Six Emperor goslings were hatched, four
crushed and one was scalped, a ghastly record ; I shall say something
about hens in a minute. Ruddy-headed Goose, eight eggs were laid,
four hatched and three reared ; Ashy-headed Goose, five eggs laid,
one hatched and reared. Blue-winged Goose, about a dozen eggs
laid, eleven were hatched and ten are alive so far, two being very
small.
Five rather interesting hybrids were reared, Andean x Egyptian,
and are remarkably like the Andean.
Black Swans reared three cygnets from five eggs ; Black-necked
laid five eggs but eventually they went bad. Whooper did not lay this
year and Bewick have never laid.
Broodies were mentioned a few lines back. They have been a
nightmare this year as it was simply a case of make do and mend.
Socking great Sussex were willing and docile, but when they flatten
young Emperor Geese in rows it is rather trying on one's temper.
Most people have pet fads about broodies, mine is Sumatra game;
they are large, weigh little, and have small feet but large wings ;
Yokohamas are excellent. Avoid a Silkie like the plague, except a
cockerel perhaps. Ducklings invariably seem to hang themselves in
a Silkie's plumage ; she also has five toes and great thick feet like a
baby elephant's, and finally she has little wing for brooding.
Silkie X hen or bantam are good, choose only good mothers to breed
from and sons of good mothers to head the pens; use only birds with
four toes if possible and feet without feathers. If they are as carefully
bred for their purpose as test laying stock is for production, it is quite
amazing how much the broodies improve and how seldom an egg
gets smashed or duckling crushed. Kill on the spot or the moment
you can spare her any hen which either sits or rears badly, otherwise
her sins are liable to be forgotten and she finds her way into the breeding
pen to transmit her sins or into the sitting box to exasperate you
afresh.

By C. L. Sibley
Although the labour and feed situations here in America during the
war made it necessary to dispose of our bird collection, including all
waterfowl, an interesting breeding took place in the spring of 1945,
before the collection was entirely dispersed.
For several seasons a fully winged Egyptian goose female mated
with a Blue-winged goose male, laid her clutch of eggs and hatched
her brood of hybrid goslings. The Blue-winged male was seemingly
a model of domesticity, and fertilized the eggs of his Blue-winged mate,
who did not seem to object to the extra-marital procedure when
Miss Egyptian created the Eternal Triangle !
We gave away the hybrid offspring when they were grown, believing
them to be mules. I think there are still two of them at the New York
Zoological Park, ornamenting, with their odd colouring, the African
Plains section of the gardens.
In 1943 the Egyptian female mated again with the Blue-winged
gander, but only one gosling was hatched. This was reared and
proved to be a female. For some reason she was left, with our other
waterfowl, in the general collection. We had no idea that she would
be other than a sterile hybrid. Early in the spring of 1945 this hybrid
female was seen to mate with a bachelor Blue-winged male, her half-
brother, but we thought nothing of it as hybrids sometimes mate,
even though they produce no eggs or offspring.
Some time later, however, on inspecting a nest-box in which Ruddy
Shelducks had nested the previous year, we found the Blue-wing
Egyptian hybrid female incubating five eggs. Expecting them to be
unfertile, from idle curiosity we candled them, and were surprised to
find them fertile, so they were put back under the goose. Three
goslings were hatched, but appeared very weak and died shortly.
Whether or not this could have been weakness induced by the close
relationship of the parent birds (half brother and sister) or was the
result of fairly distant hybridism, I cannot say, but the interesting thing
was the fact that a hybrid female from two supposedly widely separated
families should have produced fertile and hatchable eggs. We still
have the hybrid female, and I hope it may be possible later to obtain
a Blue-winged male which is unrelated, so that we can again try to
obtain this interesting breeding without the element of close relation-
ship obscuring our observations.
Captain Jean Delacour, of the New York Zoological Park, has with
a colleague worked out a new classification of the Anatidae, and it is
interesting to note that Alopochen and Cyanochen, formerly classified
as widely divergent, are now classified by Delacour as closely related.

This Goose has been bred in the San Diego Zoo, California. I have no previous

1946, 13, and writes :--
"It was in the first weeks of May, 1945, that this pair of Pied or Magpie Geese
hatched five of the six fertile eggs which had been laid. Of the five young, two failed
to survive infancy, but the remaining three have grown steadily until they are now

Gan anyone help me to increase this side of our present endeavour, please ? I have

in the venture. We have some aviaries which are unoccupied at present, and in
St. Francis Corner--where duck, bantams, geese, goats, and rabbits live in an acre
and a half of freedom, there is room for more.
Mr. Spedan Lewis has given us two aviaries and Miss Barclay-Smith has helped
us in many ways (not least by her visits and advice), and it is with her blessing that
I write to ask for any birds, particularly colourful waterfowl, or pets of any kind that
aviculturists may be generous enough to spare.

By H. Manfield, Head Bird Keeper
It has been my ambition for many years to breed the Crowned
Pigeon, as I always have had a weakness for Pigeons right from a
small boy, and have kept most of the varieties of fancy Pigeons from
Fantails to racing birds, but really think the breeding of wild Pigeons
and Doves much more interesting. It is now many years since I first
saw the Crowned Pigeon in captivity, and always longed to own a
pair ; but luck never came my way, and even if it did I guess the
price would have stopped me.
At the Zoological Gardens here we have four Crowned Pigeons,
one Goura cristata (hen) and three Goura victoria , two males and one
female, which have been here for about seven years. My greatest
difficulty was to sex them, male and female look so much alike, and
I could not find any one who could help me. Living in the Gardens,
and not far from their enclosure, I was able to watch them when the
Zoo was closed. Early one Spring morning I was passing when
I noticed one of the three displaying, but as I came close, all was
quiet again, and I was very little the wiser. The only thing left to do
was to mark them, so I decided to ring them with celluloid rings, one
on the right leg and the other on the left leg, and the third bird no
ring, and watch for results. All went along quietly for a time, when
one evening after a hot day I was sitting on a seat resting and at the
same time admiring the beauty of the Crowned Pigeon, I was surprised
to see what I thought a true pair. This raised my hopes, and next
day I caught up the bird with no ring on, and left the other two
together in a large case and very quiet, and waited results.
After nearly twelve months and no sign of nesting, I decided again

to move them to even a bigger enclosure, and build a platform on
the bough of a tree with half-inch wire netting the shape of a saucer,
about six feet from the ground. Still nothing happened, only a
little booming could be heard at times. I remembered the late
Rev. C. D. Farrar, of Yorkshire, England, once saying in a letter
that moving birds from one cage to another often did good, so took
his advice and moved them, so that they could see each other between
the netting. One morning, I was attracted by the usual booming,
and coming closer saw them displaying in manner similar to that of
the Crested Bronzewing ( Ocyphaps lophotes). I was now sure I had
a true pair, and to my surprise later, saw one pick up a small stick
in its beak. I immediately gathered what I thought suitable sticks
for nesting. To encourage them, I built the nest for them, as I knew
what frail nests most Pigeons make, and also placed a few sticks on
the floor of the cage. The one I thought to be the male was later
carrying sticks to the one on the nest. A few days later I could not
believe my own eyes, when passing I noticed a bird on the nest (which
proved to be the hen), a little uneasy when I approached. I found
the hen had laid and was truly sitting. This was on 8th February.
All went well, and on the twenty-eighth day, while standing wondering
if the egg was fertile, the male, who was on the nest, took from
under him the egg shell and latter dropped it from the nest, showing
me the egg had hatched, and so far so good.
The young one grew well, and at twelve days used to put its head
out from under the parent bird. This went on until it was thirty-six
days old, then it left the nest. Both birds shared in the incubation
and fed the young, which is now full grown and difficult at first sight
to distinguish from the parent birds. The young bird is now (July,
1946) nearly five months old, and the parents are busy again, and
have an egg, and sitting again. One egg forms the clutch, and I
should say they would nest twice a year with a certain amount of luck.
This bird has not been previously bred in Australia, but the late
Mr. Wauchsman, of Sydney, N.S.W., bred a hybrid between Goura
cristata and G. victoria. The food consisted of maize, wheat, and field
peas, and fruit such as cut-up-fine apple and pear. Stale plain cake or
bread is much relished by them ; they eat very little green food. Lettuce
is offered, but they are not keen. Mulberries grown in the Gardens
are given when available.

<bodyText confidence="0.989877875" page_id="56289007"  page_num="201" year="" vol="">
There is a very interesting account in Aviculture , 1945, p. 328,
by Eric C. Kinsey of his successfully breeding this Woodpecker in
California in 1942 and subsequent years. In 1940 two wild-taken birds
were hand-reared. They proved to be a male and a female. During
1941 they mated and attempted to nest in a desultory manner. In
June, 1942, however, they nested in earnest and produced four eggs.
All four hatched and the young ones were reared to maturity--two
males and two females.
Concerning the feeding of the young ones Kinsey writes : " For
the first few days, regurgitated grasshoppers and a limited quantity
of mealworms (similarly prepared) made up the entire food carried
into the nesting-box by the parents. Due to the fearlessness of the latter,
it was quite a simple matter to take care of the live food requirements
as all that was necessary was to hold out a grasshopper or mealworm,
and one or the other parent would immediately seize, pound, and
swallow it, then fly to the nesting hole, regurgitate the insect, dive
into the box and satisfy (at least momentarily) a clamouring youngster.
Fortunately, there were plenty of grasshoppers available, for ten
minutes 4 sweeping 5 of a near-by pasture yielded enough of the insects
to last several days.
44 Mealworms were fed sparingly, and only so as to afford an
occasional change in diet. We do not like to use mealworms even in
hand-rearing, for our experience has been that nestlings fed more or
less heavily on them are usually short-lived. They have invariably
gone bad with us during the post-juvenile moult, and either die
outright by 4 going light 5 or show aberrant feathering as the result
of an upset metabolism. To the contrary, nestlings (either hand-
reared or aviary bred) from which we have withheld mealworms, or
which have only been fed them sparingly, appear to be sturdier and
not so subject to the strain of the earlier moults. While mealworms
are undeniably a valuable food for the insectivorae they must be used
with the utmost discretion and judgment, particularly with nestlings.
44 The regular food regimen for these Woodpeckers includes a
4 soft-bill ' mixture, fruits of all kinds, acorns when procurable and
last, but by no means least, pablum mixed with goats' milk and
fortified with desiccated dried meat and 4 Galen B '. This latter mixture
is used by us for all our birds and we have found it invaluable,
particularly for the more delicate species, however the proportion of
the fortifying agent is varied, depending on the species to be fed, and
the degree of the insectivorousness.

44 Within a week after hatching, fresh, unregurgitated grasshoppers
were being fed to the young and it was about this time that we first
noticed the pablum mixture being carried to the nest by the male.
Whether this mixture was swallowed and then regurgitated before
being fed to the nestlings, we were unable to ascertain with certainty ;
our impression, however, is that it was fed fresh, probably moistened
with saliva. The youngsters throve well on it and soon fresh fruit
(principally pear and apple) and acorn and almond meats were also
being offered them by the parents. 55
They left the nest-box for the first time on 28th July, Kinsey
continues : 44 Both parents and young returned to the nesting-box
each night and slept together as a family group, and this arrangement
continued until the end of October, when the juveniles moved into
other shelter facilities in the aviary. These they utilized as roosting
and sleeping quarters.
44 They all continued to live amicably together in the same aviary,
even after the parents started nesting operations in the following
spring. 55
Their subsequent history is as follows :--
44 The first clutch of eggs in 1943 was undoubtedly laid by the old
female, but all three females, mother and daughters, attempted to
brood them and in the resultant melee the eggs were broken. The old
male then chose one of his daughters for a mate, and she laid three eggs
and started to incubate them, but interference by the other birds
again caused trouble and the eggs disappeared.
44 The other young female had, in the interim, mated with one of
the young males, so she took over the nesting-box and proceeded to
set up housekeeping. A few days later the young female mate of the
old male moved in with her mate and shortly there were nine eggs in
the nesting-box, brooded by the two young females, sometimes
together, more often separately. 55
This joint enterprise might have succeeded had not the old male
been accidentally crushed by the aviary door. 44 When the eggs hatched,
neither of the two young mothers or the young father would carry
food to the nest-box ; the old female attempted to feed, but was
driven off by the other three and the brood died as soon as the contents
of the yolk sacs were exhausted. 55
One of the young males was killed during a terrific wind-storm in
December.
44 In 1944 the single surviving male mated with one of the young
females. . . . Eggs were subsequently laid and incubated, but failed
to hatch. The same was true of a subsequent clutch."
Early in 1945 both young females mated with their brother, both
laid eggs and both incubated. Only some of the eggs were fertile and
the young ones quickly succumbed. More eggs were laid in mid-June,

possibly by both females, and from these six young were hatched.
Owing to unforeseen circumstances only one of these was fully reared.
Kinsey ends his account : " We are sorry that two survivors (one
of each sex) could not have been salvaged from this last mating, for
it might have enabled us to continue inbreeding through at least
another generation. As matters are, we now have a healthy, vigorous
specimen, product of a brother-sister mating, the parents, in turn,
being products of a brother-sister mating. How far such intensive
inbreeding may be continued in this species of Woodpeckers without
impairment as to size, vigour, or fertility of offspring is still an interesting
point for speculation."
The only other success with Woodpeckers of which I have a record
is the White-headed ( Melanerpes candidus), bred by Dr. Macklin in

A note in Aviculture , 1945, p. 342, reads : " Mrs. Wright's African
Greys are hatching their fourth nest, which will make twelve young
this year." How many have been fully reared is not stated. Mr. and
Mrs. Gilbert Lee, of Los Angeles, were the first successful breeders
in the U.S.A. in 1933. Early in August three eggs were laid, one of
which hatched, but the young one only lived three weeks. In a second
nest there were three eggs, all hatched, and one young one was
eventually reared, partly by hand. In 1934 they had complete success,
a brood of four was fully reared by the parents alone. There is a
photograph and an account by the breeders in Aviculture , 1934,
Nov.-Dee., p. 18. In 1939, p. 117, Gilbert Lee gives six photographs
of various stages of hand-rearing, and writes : " Since then (1934),
we have consistently raised more and more as we have been able to
get the old birds mated." Mrs. Gilbert Lee continues to breed them.
The only other success in the U.S.A. seems to have been obtained by
an unnamed gentleman in Florida. He kept his birds in " an enclosure
much like a hen coop ", yet two fine young were reared (. Aviculture ,

SPECULATIONS ON THE MIMICRY OF
THE JAY

I am inclined to think that the Jay surpasses even the Starling as
a mimic, although, as through constant and in most cases quite
unjustified persecution, it has a well-founded fear of mankind it is
less apt to be heard by the average person. This trait, however,
was evidently well known in former times. Readers of the Canterbury
Tales will recall how Phoebus had a milk-white Crow :
" Which in a cage he fostred many a day
And taught to speken as men doon a jay,"
which suggests that the latter was the most commonly kept " talking
bird " of that period.
A favourite item in the Jay's repertoire is the hooting of the Tawny
Owl. This I have heard on a great many occasions, in the north and
west of England, as well as about my home in Surrey. It is a good
enough imitation to deceive anyone when first heard, but is usually
softer and lower pitched than the original, although on the 8th of
October, 1945, at Kilvington, in Yorkshire, I heard a Jay give a less per-
fect rendering in a louder, husky tone similar to that in which a tame Jay
mimics the human voice. Amongst other well rendered imitations
that I have heard from wild Jays were the notes of the cock Pheasant,
Magpie (the chattering rattle), Mallard (the wheezing " quairk "
of the drake), Jackdaw, Blackbird (the alarm note in its various
phases), Little Owl, the " herwick " cry of the Tawny Owl, and the
creaking call of the common Partridge; the last once only and from
the same Jay that gave the loud husky version of the Tawny Owl's
hooting mentioned above.
Why birds indulge in mimicry is, to my mind, a most puzzling
and interesting question. Listening to the vocal efforts of the Jay,
Starling, and Common Myna, I have often received the impression
that in such birds we may be witnessing the preliminary stages (in
an evolutionary sense) from which the complicated songs of various
other passerine birds have been evolved. It is of course well known
that with many " song birds " the ability to reproduce the normal

song of the species is not innate, and it will not be uttered if the bird
has never been allowed to hear it. Many birds which utter what one
might loosely term a " standard 55 song for the species, nevertheless
sometimes interject notes copied from other species. Some, such as
the Red Rumped Chat, habitually do so. It would be most instructive
to know whether mimicry is often, or ever, indulged in by species
in which the ability for natural specific song is innate, or whether,
as I rather suspect, aptitude for mimicry is correlated with lack of
innate ability to reproduce the normal song of the species.
Birds appear usually, as one would expect, to show no compre-
hension of the significance of the sounds they imitate, but Parrots
have at times been alleged habitually to repeat words or phrases at
appropriate moments, and I have heard a tame Jay, when startled
by the sudden appearance of a cat, utter the most hysterical version
of the Blackbird's alarm before relapsing into his own harsh alarm cries.
Both these cases may merely be the simple, but not altogether un-
intelligent association of ideas, but the latter example certainly
suggests that some copied sounds may come to have as much signifi-
cance for the bird as the instinctive cries of its own species, if, as I
imagine is the case, the alarm note of all species is instinctive, and the
power of reproducing it innate.
The cock Jay mentioned above, which I kept for some years prior
to the war, was a most accomplished mimic, but his favourite sounds
appeared to be a human whistle : any short whistled tune he would
repeat accurately after hearing it only a few times, and these short
whistled tunes (there were three of them), or rather phrases, he
repeated with far greater frequency than the rest of his extensive
repertoire. It was noticeable that although at the time I also kept
domestic Pigeons, Stock, Barbary, and Turtle Doves, neither of the
two cock Jays ever to my knowledge made any sound suggestive of
the cooing of any species of Pigeon, although they mimicked almost
every other bird within ear-shot, besides several non-avian sounds
that they heard far less frequently. Is it possible that sounds which
they are not capable of imitating have no interest whatever to the
Jay, except, of course, when they are constantly associated with
important events in its life, such as the loud noise usually made by
a man walking in a wood ?
Recently (24th June, 1946), I caught a fledgeling Jay which had
evidently just left the nest, and was not strong enough on the wing to
evade capture. Whilst I was ringing it, its cries of distress brought
up the parents, who mobbed me vehemently at close quarters. As
well as their own notes they uttered those of the Magpie (the harsh
warning chatter), Tawny Owl, and the alarm note of the Blackbird.
The Magpie notes were certainly uttered by both sexes, since I heard
the harsh chatter constantly from both birds when at some distance

from each other, but the credit for the rest of the repertoire is un-
certain, as owing to the continual movement of the birds it was
impossible to even guess at sexing them.
Two points which struck me were : Firstly, the exactness of the
Magpie imitation--usually the Magpie's notes are rendered in a
typical soft "Jay accent ", but in this case had I not seen the birds
at close quarters, I should never have believed I was listening to a j
Jay. Secondly : That all the notes used were ones which might be
expected to be associated with fear and anxiety in the birds' minds.
This may have been entirely coincidental, but is a point worthy
of study. The Handbook of British Birds records this habit of mobbing
human intruders with borrowed notes in the Irish sub-species, but
unfortunately omits any reference to the precise nature of the notes
used.
No doubt some who read this short article will be able to supply
the answers to the queries I have raised, or to give their own opinions
on the subject, and if so, I feel sure that many others besides the writer

a day spent on Tarakan at the end of May and a couple of days on

where the hospital to which I was attached was functioning, and on
the adjacent small island of Raou. Morotai, the northernmost island
of the Moluccas group, is about fifty miles long and twenty miles
wide, and is situated a few degrees north of the Equator. Before the
cessation of hostilities the only area under Allied control was a small
perimeter at the southern extremity of the island, and apart from
a few native villages, the island is almost entirely undeveloped, except
for the area which the troops occupied. My stay there embraced
the end of the wet season and most of the following dry, during which
considerable breeding activity was noted. Being to the east of Wallace's
Line, the birds mainly exhibited Australian affinities, as will be seen
by the following account of the species observed.
Scrub Fowl (Megapodius sp.).--The loud clanging calls of this
bird were frequently to be heard, both by day and by night,
emanating from small patches of uncleared jungle adjacent to the

hospital. Although the birds must have been fairly plentiful, I was
never fortunate enough to see an adult, although they were said to
come into the hospital area at times. I had an interesting experience
in regard to their fledgelings. On one occasion in July a small dark
bird about the size of a fortnight old chicken flew into my tent ;
it only stayed for a moment and then flew out again. My first thought
was that it was a Quail, but its flight did not seem strong enough.
I followed it up and got another look at it before it flew off again
and I then felt certain that it was a megapode. A few days later
I noticed another, or possibly the same bird, fly into the tent next
to mine. On going to investigate it flew out, and I shot out my left
hand and brought off a perfect slips catch ! The chick must have
been fairly recently hatched as it was entirely covered with dark
brown down except for the wing feathers, which were speckled and
fairly well developed ; there was also a little tuft representing the
crest, which is a feature of the adult. During October I discovered
a nesting mound in a patch of jungle not 20 yards from a main road ;
the surface was well scratched over, but I am unable to say if it was
in use. The natives call the bird " Maleo " which is the name of
an allied bird found in the Celebes.
Fruit Pigeons. --A large pigeon with a grey head and greyish-
white under-parts and dark greenish back was often to be heard and
occasionally seen in the few tall trees which had been left standing
amongst the coco-nuts. A smaller Pigeon with a white head and
dark upper parts was seen once only in a patch of jungle near the
perimeter.
Rail. --A single Rail was seen running across a road on Amboina.
It was mainly of a reddish-brown colour and a little larger than a
Landrail ; it may have been the Chestnut Rail ( Eulabeornis castaneo-
ventris ) or some near ally.
Sea Birds.-- True sea birds were very uncommon, the only ones
identified with certainty being a Tern of medium size, which was
moderately plentiful, and an occasional Noddy, probably Anous stolidus.
Waders.-- Waders were first noticed in the first week in September
and remained moderately plentiful throughout the rest of my stay.
I recognized five species, of which I was able to identify three with
reasonable certainty. These were the Turnstone ( Arenaria interpres),
Golden Plover ( Pluvialis dominions), and Whimbrel (Numenius phaopus).
Of the last named I saw a pair on Amboina only. The other two
species may have been the Sanderling ( Crocethia alba) and Sharp-
tailed Sandpiper ( Erolia acuminata), but I am by no means certain
of their identification.
Herons.-- Two species only were seen. A pair of the graceful
Plumed Egret ( Egretta intermedia) were seen on a coral swamp on
several occasions during November ; they did not appear to be in

breeding plumage. Another Heron, probably the Reef ( Demiegretta
sacra ), was fairly common throughout my stay ; it appeared to spend
most of its time by day roosting in the coco-nuts and I think it bred
there. If my identification is correct the birds seen were all of the
dark phase.
Frigate Birds. --These were often seen circling over the peninsula
and also out at sea. They have a most characteristic appearance in
flight owing to the peculiar shape of their wings. I do not propose
to hazard specific identification.
Birds of Prey.--A large Sea-Eagle, almost certainly the White-
breasted ( Haliaetus leucogaster) , was seen on a few occasions. Its leisurely
flight makes the description of it " floating like a great butterfly "
particularly apt. A pair of Red-backed Sea-Eagles were seen
on one occasion on a small island in Morotai Strait. A Kestrel
(&apos;Cerchneis sp.) was very common, it was much darker, both on the
back and breast than the Australian form, and had a noticeably
grey rump. It bred in hollows in dead trees and was also observed
on Amboina.
Owls.-- A nocturnal bird, with a call somewhat resembling that
of the Boobook Owl, was frequently to be heard, but I never caught
a glimpse of one. I feel tolerably certain that it was an Owl, but it
may possibly have been a Frogmouth.
Parrots. --The Parrots were the most conspicuous and, to me,
the most interesting group of birds observed. Easily the commonest
species was the Yellow-backed Lory ( Domicella garrulus jlavopalliatus ).
It is a vivid scarlet bird with green wings and a conspicuous patch of
yellow on the mantle and also on the shoulders, and is a little larger
and stouter in build than the common Australian Blue Mountain
Lorikeet. It apparently fed largely on the nectar of the coco-nut
flowers, and its call note consisted of typical Lorikeet screeches when
in flight and rather gurgling notes when feeding. I observed it both
on Morotai and on Raou, it was almost always seen in pairs and was
very pugnacious when two pairs met ; when perched the typical
jerky Lory movements were noticeable, and the usual preening habits
were in evidence. I am inclined to think they were breeding through-
out my stay, as a pair were seen investigating a hole in a dead tree
in June ; a young bird, which was noticeably duller than the adults,
was caught in July ; and fledged young were observed being fed in
October and November. This bird is called " Loo-rie " by the natives
and is commonly kept by them as a pet on a small perch to which
it is tied by the leg. They are fed on banana and germinated coco-
nut and seem very hardy. I was able to get a pair of these birds down
to the Adelaide Zoo, where they are thriving. I saw a single captive
specimen of the closely allied Chattering Lory (D. g. garrulus) which
had been brought from the adjacent island of Halmahera ; it is a little

larger and lacks the yellow mantle. This bird also found its way to
the Adelaide Zoo. A lovely Lory, of which I saw a pair on two
occasions only, in November, was the Violet-necked {Eos squamata
variegata). It is a gaudy bird, a mixture of crimson and purple, and
is a little smaller than the two preceding species ; it was seen feeding
in the coco-nuts. Yet another Lory, of which I only saw a captive
specimen, was the black-capped {Domicella l. lory). This bird had
almost certainly been brought to Morotai, as it is only found in the
western portion of New Guinea. During the early months of my stay
I saw small flocks of a Lorikeet which I felt fairly sure was one of the
smaller species of the genus Trichoglossus ; it kept to the tall trees
and did not visit the coco-nuts. It was presumably nomadic as I did
not see it during the later months of the year. The only species of
Lory described from Morotai that I did not identify is one of the genus
Hypocharmosyna, this possibly was the bird, but I am rather doubtful.
Turning now to the TRUE PARROTS, the second commonest
species was one of the Red-cheeked Parrots ( Geoffroyus cyanicollis) , a
green bird about the size of a Crimson-winged Parrot, the male having
a red beak and pinkish-red head, and the female a black beak and
greyish-brown head. I always thought the male looked very like an
overgrown Peach-faced Lovebird ! In the early months of my stay
these birds were always to be seen in pairs and attracted attention
by their rapid flight and harsh monotonous call, both when flying
and perching. In June and July I observed females investigating
hollows in dead coco-nut palms and also saw the males feeding
and displaying to the females ; the display consisted of a purposeful
walk by the male along a palm frond towards the female and
culminated in rather an absurd hop with outspread tail. I think they
must have laid about the middle of August as for about a month
thereafter females were not often seen and were very silent in flight.
I do not know what this species feeds on, but presume that it is a fruit
eater ; it is certainly not a nectar feeder. My experiences with this
bird in captivity were disappointing ; I was fortunate enough to
obtain a very tame, recently fledged, bird from some natives on Raou
about the middle of August. It was being fed on bananas and eating
well, but at that time I was quite unable to obtain fruit of any sort,
and it did not thrive on germinated coco-nut and died after a few
days. Then, late in October, I saw a female, calling loudly, fly to
a hole in a coco-nut and hanging to the edge, proceed to feed two
practically fully-grown young. The chance was irresistible and I got
a native to climb the tree and get the two young for me. I fed them
four times a day on chopped-up apple, which I had to force down
their throats, but after four days of this they were showing no signs
of feeding themselves and my patience was wearing out, so I released
them, and within a few hours their parents had found and were

<bodyText confidence="0.999123088888889" page_id="56289016"  page_num="210" year="" vol="">
feeding them. I was able to keep them under observation for a few
days and they appeared to thrive. The nestlings can be sexed, for
although both have yellowish-orange beaks and greyish-brown heads,
in the male there is a pinkish suffusion, while in the female the greyish
colour is not as intense nor does it extend as far on the nape. I was
bitterly disappointed at not getting the chance of introducing these
interesting birds to Australian aviculture. The native name for this
Parrot is "Bur-rum". The Grand Eclectus (E. grandis ) was fairly
common, and I possessed a tame female, which fed entirely on
germinated coco-nut, for several months of my stay. They were most
often to be seen flying singly in a leisurely flapping way at some
height above the coco-nuts and uttering their harsh notes at intervals.
I had one opportunity of observing a fine male which was feeding
in a tall tree, presumably on some fruit. The third true Parrot seen was
one of the Great-billed Parrots ( Tanygnathus) . It was only seen in
flight, when it resembled an Indian Ringneck with its shrill cries
and quick beating of its wings. It was noticeably short-tailed and
appeared to be yellowish under the wings. I was disappointed not
to have seen any Cockatoos, as both the White-crested (if. alba)
and Salmon-crested (K. moluccensis) are found in this group of islands.
Roller. --The Australian Roller or Dollar Bird ( Eurystomus
orientalis ) was seen throughout my stay with the exception of the
last couple of months. Usually in pairs, it was easily recognized by
its harsh call and aerobatic displays from the tops of tall dead trees ;
also by the conspicuous markings on the under sides of the wings
from which the name Dollar Bird is derived.
Kingfishers. --Four species were identified, two being well-known
Australian birds. These were the Sacred (. Halcyon sanctus) and the
Mangrove ( H . chloris), the former being bluish-green on the back
and buff below and the latter larger, brighter blue on the back and
white under parts. Both were often to be seen around the coral swamp
near the hospital. Another Kingfisher which I only saw on one
occasion and am unable to identify was considerably larger with a
blue back and white head ; it was seen on the seashore and was
a most striking bird. I was not fortunate enough to see the long-
tailed species ( Tanysiptera doris) which is peculiar to Morotai, but
my colleague, Major Ian Macgillivray, observed it once.
Hornbill. --A single specimen of a moderate sized Hornbill was
seen in flight on one occasion, it had a harsh croaking cry.
Bee-eater.--I never had the luck to see the Australian Bee-eater
(Merops ornatus), but Major Macgillivray informed me that he identified
this species on several occasions during the early part of our stay.
Tree-Swift ( Macropteryx sp.).--These birds caused me more
trouble in identification than any other. I first saw a pair on Raou
in August, and thereafter they were often to be seen on Morotai.

They are large birds with very long wings and long forked tails,
mainly grey in colour with some black markings on the wings. In
flight they make a discordant squeaking call and reminded me very
much of a Cockatiel in size and general shape, as the forked tail is
not always apparent. They are fond of perching on dead trees and
hawking therefrom ; one pair that I watched seemed to greatly
resent the presence of a pair of Kingfishers in a near by tree.
Cuckoo. --A bird, from whose flight I felt certain belonged to
this family, was seen on one occasion. It was about the size of the
Australian Pallid Cuckoo.
Swallow. --A small bird of this family was very plentiful from
September onwards, though rarely seen prior to this. It had the
usual metallic head and back, the throat and breast were dark,
gradually fading to a dirty cream colour, and the tail was short and
square. This species was also plentiful on Amboina.
Flycatcher. --A single pair of birds, undoubtedly referable to
the genus Myiagra, were observed in a dense patch of jungle, searching
for food in low trees and bushes close to the ground. The male had
a metallic black head and back and whitish under parts, the female
had a greyish head and back and a rusty throat. The tail was
moderately long in both sexes.
Fantail.-- A bird very closely allied to, if not identical with, the
Australian Willie Wagtail ( Rhipidura leucophrys ) was very common,
especially around clearings. The habits are the same as those of
the Australian form, but they are not as tame and I never heard
them singing at night. This species was also seen on Amboina. My
early impression was that the white eyebrow was absent, but this
was later proved wrong.
Cuckoo-Shrike.-- A bird of this genus, which I think was probably
Coracina papuensis, was seen fairly frequently ; it had the typical
call and flight and the queer habit of folding and rearranging its
wings after alighting. I saw a bird carrying food to a nest of young
early in October.
Caterpillar-eater.-- I was able to identify a single male of this
genus (. Lalage ) late in October. It had white under parts, black head,
and grey back. I heard it call on several occasions, but did not hear
the trilling song which is characteristic of the Australian bird.
Wood-Swallow. --The White-breasted Wood-Swallow ( Artamus
leucorhynchus) was plentiful throughout my stay. It was almost always
to be seen perched on dead trees in the coral swamp and telephone
wires were also favoured. It is a pretty bird with dark head, grey
back, and white rump and breast. Newly-fledged young were seen
at the end of July and again later in the year.
Sun-bird. --This bird ( Cyrtostomus frenatus) was easily the most
plentiful small bird on Morotai and was also seen on Amboina.

It is a most attractive species, being greenish on the back and yellow
on the breast, with a brilliant blue throat patch adorning the male.
It has an extremely sweet song, almost Canary-like. As far as I could
judge it is mainly a nectar feeder, living largely on the coco-nut and
paw-paw flowers, but it probably is partly insectivorous as it was to
be seen at times investigating the interior of tents. I feel that this
bird would be very suitable for aviculture ; it should do well on the
type of food supplied for Sugar-birds and Honeyeaters. In fact, in
size and shape it closely resembles the Yellow-winged Sugar-bird.
Bulbuls. --Several greenish birds, about the size and appearance
of the Australian Singing Honeyeater, were seen in a patch of jungle,
feeding on small berries. I have since identified them as the
Moluccan Bulbul ( Criniger chloris).
Friar-bird. --This species ( Tropidorhynchus fuscicollis) , said to be
found only on Morotai, was a very common bird in the coco-nut
plantations. It is a plain brown bird, with rather a rough appearance
about its plumage. I am not certain whether it has a bare patch on
the head or not ; if present it is certainly not very marked. It is
about the size of a Wattle-bird and is very noisy, especially in the
early morning and late evening, the notes are rather plaintive and
not unpleasant. It was usually seen in small parties and struck one
as a very stupid clumsy bird, very reminiscent in its behaviour of
the Noisy Miner.
Wagtail.-- A single bird of the genus Motacilla was observed near
a small pool in a clearing. It was greenish above and had some
yellow on the abdomen and under tail-coverts.
Finch. --A single brownish Finch, which I took to belong to the
genus Muni a, was seen on Morotai ; in the short look that I got at it
it seemed to resemble one of the Spice-Finches. On Amboina small
parties of Finches, presumably the same, were seen in the cleared
areas. A Sparrow, probably introduced, was fairly common around
the town of Ambon.
Shining Starling. --These birds ( Aplonis sp.) were seen on Morotai
throughout my stay and were also noted on Amboina. They were
nearly always in small flocks, and were most often seen in flight or
perched on tall trees, occasionally they were seen feeding on swampy
ground. Typical Starling calls were made while flying. They were
seen entering hollows in dead trees and presumably breed therein,
although the Australian bird, which must be closely allied, builds
in colonies. They appeared to be of a metallic colour, some birds,
presumably immature, showing dirty white under parts.
Crow-Starling. --On my last day on Morotai I observed a pair
of large greyish-black birds fly into a patch of jungle. They may
have been Mynas, but I rather think they were the Crow-Starling
(Lycocorax morotensis) which is peculiar to the island.

For several years examples (males) of this well-known Australian
species have been kept here. It is a bird which we have found to be
hardy, long lived, and altogether an amusing and easy subject to
maintain in health.
Habits Generally .--In habits, except during the early morning and
evening, when they most frequently move about and give utterance to
their very remarkable far reaching laugh or chatter, these Kingfishers
may be said to be rather sluggishly inclined, and, I have observed,
spend much of their time sitting still upon a log or substantial perch.
When alarmed or when taking exercise, however, they appear different
creatures, and are particularly active at shooting (swooping) up to a
high perch, or silently dropping down into the long grass to capture
some unlucky field mouse, vole, or earthworm. They also capture
stray small birds (Chaffinches, etc., which are not quick enough at
squeezing through the meshing of their aviary), and their method of
killing such prey, which I have known to include a Thrush, is
repeatedly to dash it against a stout perch until it is quite dead and,
I should imagine, almost reduced to pulp.
Disposition .--Given plenty of space and liberally fed, the species
appears quite safe to keep with other birds, down to the size of a
Barbary Dove.
Breeding .---Until 1910 we possessed no female, and our first success
in this direction took place during the spring of 1912, when a pair
took possession of a hollow log, laid three eggs (the first, 21st April),
and hatched two young. These, without the slightest difficulty, were
reared by simply keeping the parents liberally supplied with fragments
(chopped) of animal food. (Freshly killed rabbit, Sparrows, etc.)

214 A. F. MOODY-AN EARLY ACCOUNT OF SOME PERCHING BIRDS
Nest-- A slight depression amidst the rotten wood lining the bottom
of the log.
Eggs. --Pure white of a size and shape resembling Pheasants' eggs.
Incubation. --Chiefly by the female, twenty and twenty-two days
respectively.
Of the Chicks. --I have notes that they could squeak and hold their
heads up as soon as dry. That at eight days old, judging from the
numerous small pellets in the nest, they were being supplied with food
including fur, bone, and feathers. At fourteen days old the elder
squab was about equal in size to a plucked Pigeon, was just getting
its eyes open, and had the body covered with coarse quills through
which the feather colouring was visible. At five weeks old each bird
left the nest. Also that, Owl-like, one chick having two days start of
the other, maintained the difference in size and development until
fully feathered, and finally, that these young, on being parted with
when fifteen weeks old, appeared to differ little from their parents,
except that the blue on the wings of one bird showed pink in certain
lights, and the bills of both were somewhat shorter and better fitting.
Also the yellowish-white on the under mandible was not so pure as
in the adults, but clouded with dark horn colour at its basal half.
Sexual Differences. --The female of this breeding pair might readily
be distinguished on the wing from the male by the absence of the
conspicuous blue rump streak.
Hardiness. --As before stated, the species is very hardy, and our
specimens, being kept in a large aviary, provided with high perches
and a rather too low shed, declined to seek shelter and, even during
the severest of weather, without ill-effect or apparent unhappiness,
roosted tucked up side by side, their usual mode of sleeping, quite in
the open upon a high exposed perch. In spite of this apparent hardi-
ness, however, I would recommend the species being slept under
cover during the winter months, and may state that we latterly made
it a rule, during severe frost or falls of snow, to confine our birds to a
wire-fronted shed.
Roller (Coracias garrulus)
We possessed at different times about half a dozen of these very
beautiful and garrulous birds. The species may be described as
moderately easy to keep, but being like the Golden Oriole possessed
of a nervous temperament, and one of those birds that fly from perch
to perch, requiring gentle treatment and considerable care in arranging
their perches to preserve their larger feathers intact.
Disposition , etc. --The males appear to require keeping apart, and
we found both sexes somewhat spiteful and uncertain in temper
towards each other. With their owners one or two examples became

familiarly tame. Others, receiving the same treatment, remained
wild and suspicious.
Food. --Appears to require a regular supply of casting material,
and our examples with the addition of a small daily allowance of
hard-boiled egg and an occasional mealworm or cockroach, thrived
when fed upon fragments of rabbits' flesh (fur, bone, and flesh all
chopped up together), varied with pieces of mouse or Sparrow.
Hardiness , Housing , etc. --The remarks put forward under the heading
of Golden Oriole apply to this species.
Breeding. --I understand we were the first to breed this interesting
species in captivity, rearing two young during the summer of 1901.
The nesting site chosen was a hollow horizontal log, fixed high up
in their shed. On looking into this log, the beautiful glossy white
eggs could just be seen, resting upon the rotten wood at the darker
end. The first egg was laid about 13th June, and incubation, as far
as we could tell without disturbing the birds, lasted eighteen or
nineteen days, the first young bird leaving the nest on the 26th day.
These could be heard in the log at an early age, and from the first,
the parents, unlike many other birds, simplified matters greatly by
supplying their offspring with artificial food, upon which, with the
addition of mealworms and a few black beetles, the young were reared.
Indian Roller (C. indicus)
We possessed for some time an example of this still more beautiful
species, a bird whose habits and requirements appeared similar to
those of the last species.
Hoopoe (Upupa epops)
Some six or eight Hoopoes have been kept here. They are interesting
and ornamental little birds to possess, but prove somewhat delicate of
constitution and difficult to preserve in health for any considerable
length of time.
Special Requirements. --The species derives great pleasure and no
doubt benefit by repeatedly probing with its long bill into the loose
earth, and I would recommend that in confinement, wherever possible,
this bird be given the range of an outer flight containing both short
turf and a natural floor of a loose gritty nature.
Food. --Our birds had daily access to a heap of frequently renewed
turf refuse, from which by frequent boring they procured a certain
number of earthworms, insects, etc. We also gave mealworms, and
as to artificial food, nothing seemed to suit them better than a mixture
(lightly mixed after being prepared separately), of chopped hard-
boiled egg and fresh uncooked bullocks' or sheeps' heart.
Hardiness. --Susceptible to cold combined with damp, requiring a
dry sleeping chamber and artificial heat during the colder months.

216 A. F. MOODY-AN EARLY ACCOUNT OF SOME PERCHING BIRDS
As a Wild Bird. --The species is evidently no stranger to the county,
for according to Mr. T. H. Nelson's Birds of Yorkshire , about seventy
examples have been recorded, chiefly, I should imagine, during the
spring or autumn. The only time, however, that I have been fortunate
enough to see a Hoopoe in a wild state occurred during mid-winter
(early in January, 1906), taking place as follows : Searching for a lost
passage Falcon on the open wolds, and while having lunch under a
hedge, I was attracted by the rather Jay-like note of a bird which at
that time I was unfamiliar with, and on looking round, observed at a
distance of about thirty yards a Hoopoe boring in a heap of horse
droppings. For some time I had this bird under observation through
a pair of field glasses, and it was interesting to note its mode of feeding
and the way it had of raising and depressing its crest at each call.
Also that frequently it stood quite still with crest depressed, and in
that attitude might easily have escaped observation, as it then appeared
a much less conspicuous object that when seen on the wing.
Cuckoo (Cuculus canorus)
As an aviary bird I have had little experience of the Cuckoo, but
judging from the fact that the young are not difficult to rear, and
that some years ago there came into my possession a very ragged,
but apparently healthy specimen, with flights and tail worn to stumps,
which later completely moulted out and lived for upwards of a year
in a cage, there seems reasonable ground for supposing that the
species, properly treated, would prove interesting.
Food. --Takes readily to fragments of raw lean meat but, as such a
diet appears conducive to fits, I would suggest as a trial only a moderate
allowance of meat supplemented with hard boiled egg, some good
insectivorous mixture, mealworms, and as many caterpillars as can be
procured.
Disposition. --A nestling or two which we rescued from boys and
kept for a few months here, proved finger tame while young, after-
wards nervous, easily alarmed, and only fit subjects to be kept in an
aviary provided with perches suitably arranged for birds which use
their wings in moving from perch to perch. On the whole rather a
dirty and untidy feeder.
Sulphur Breasted Toucan (Rhamphastos piscivorus )
A pair kept for about three years. They proved most amusing
subjects, and on account of their ungainly bills, gorgeous colouring,
and grotesque appearance generally, a great attraction to visitors.
Habits. --Very arboreal. Our birds were exceedingly clever at
jumping or scurrying (flying) from perch to perch. Upon the ground
they progressed awkwardly yet swiftly by means of a series of oblique

jumps and, when at roost, adopted the curious attitude of sleeping
with their heads drawn in, and their tails reversed over the back.
Voice. --Usually silent birds, but capable when alarmed or when
handled, of giving utterance to a succession of shrill cries resembling
the squealing of a sucking pig.
Sexual Differences .--Male differed from the female by his larger size
and more brilliantly coloured bill.
Food. --Apparently simple feeders, but rather large and wasteful
eaters, so to prevent them throwing it about we supplied their food
(twice daily) in the bottom of a 2 lb. jam jar. This food usually
consisted of three parts boiled rice sweetened with a little sugar, to
one part of soaked (or scalded) currants and sultanas, also a daily
allowance of a banana cut up into small pieces.
Hardiness. --Somewhat delicate as regards cold and damp, and
requiring artificial heat during the colder months.

Conspicuous by their absence in the collection. I need only state
that an odd example or pair have been kept more as pets than for
avicultural study.
Budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus )
A few kept as children's pets, breeds freely, and shows to the best
advantage when several pairs are kept together in a large aviary.
One of the most pleasing arrangements for a breeding colony of
Budgerigars which I have had anything to do with was an 8 ft.
section of a slightly decayed tree, three feet in diameter, and extending
from floor to wired roof. This capped by an umbrella of zinc to keep
the rain off, had numerous holes bored in the sides with a large
auger. These the birds quickly enlarged to their liking, and looked
very ornamental as they flew in and out like a colony of Sand Martins.
Orange-winged Parrakeet (Brologeris chariri)
A pair of these pretty little Parrakeets kept as house cage birds.
My chief recollection of the species is that they were finger tame,
charming pets, but altogether too noisy for indoors.
Birds of Prey
Although the birds of prey differ considerably in their requirements,
they have several wants in common, and apart from the similar
nature of their food, they all require housing in structures with a
comfortable, dry, and draught-proof shed at the back, and are much
better with the sides of their aviaries boarded, the front and roof only
being of wire. They all, even the Owls, with perhaps the one exception
of the Barn Owl, are not averse to sunlight, and in addition to a shady

retreat are happier with access to full sunshine. As to the size of the
aviaries, I have known the smaller species, particularly the Owls,
thrive in quite small places, say 6 feet by 6 feet.
Whenever possible more roomy quarters are of course desirable.
We found an aviary 25 feet in length, 14 feet wide, and 8 feet high,
exclusive of a 9 ft. shed at the back, ample space for a pair of Kites
or Snowy Owls.
As to the floor covering for aviaries containing birds of prey, the
shed part, if divided, is perhaps better covered with a good layer of
clean sand and for the outer flights, although brick or stone pavement
which can be swilled daily is cleaner, fine gravel is suitable.
Perches .--In choosing perches, fairly stout ones of different sizes are
best, removing all small useless twigs, and of course arranging them
so that a bird is encouraged to take exercise (i.e. must use its wings
in moving from one to another), and when sitting upon one perch is
unable to soil another, or any part of the woodwork with its droppings.
These perches may be horizontal bars, natural trees, or T-shaped
stands, and if they are rough, that is with the bark on, all the better
for the birds' feet. An upright post is also a great attraction. In
addition to these wooden perches, a large stone or piece of rock is
usually appreciated by these and other birds, and helps to keep their
bills and feet in order. The only other piece of furniture required, if
it may be termed as such, is a suitably sized shallow bath of clean
water, always or periodically left within reach.
Food .--Regarding a food supply for these carnivorous birds, where
numbers are kept, or where the aviculturist has not the advantage of
rural surroundings, recourse may be had to butcher's meat or to
horse flesh ; the latter item, however, we did not use, and excepting
as a change of diet, I should imagine the coarser animal foods to be
too stimulating or heating for the generality of the group. (This is
not intended to apply to the Eagles, Vultures, etc.) We use as a
staple and reserve food for the larger species, freshly-killed wild
rabbit (usually the small unsaleable ones, or those damaged in
shooting), varying this menu in most cases with rats, Wood Pigeons,
Moorhens, fowls' heads and necks, etc. For the smaller kind, such
as the Long-eared Owl and Kestrel, we also depend to a certain
extent upon rabbit, but feed largely upon mice, voles, young rats,
Sparrows, etc., with an occasional meal of sheeps' heart.
Feeding .--As to feeding, once a day towards evening is sufficiently
often to feed most species ; they should be just keen enough to jump
on to food thrown from the hand, and kept at that by regulating
the supply accordingly. The smaller kinds, however, cannot bear
long fasts, and in some instances need food (not necessarily as much
as they will eat), at each end of the day, whilst nestlings when growing
and adults when moulting require treating liberally. That is, the

former are better with food continually before them and the latter
with two meals a day. It is a good rule also to be generous in the
matter of food during severe weather and the damp autumn months,
and to make sure that all species have a gorge, or meal, consisting
of as much as ever they can eat one day in the week, followed by a
sparing feed or fast on the next day.
It is also well to remember that few members of this group when
in a state of nature, except the carrion feeders, take a meal without
casting (i.e. fur or feathers with fragments of bone), and for that
reason this should be supplied as often as procurable, and in no case
less than twice or three times per week. Failing natural food containing
casting, feathers, rabbits' fur, or even clipped tow, mixed with chopped
lean meat makes an excellent substitute. All food of whatever nature
should be neither tainted nor frozen, and warm food, that is food
given as soon as killed and while the blood is still warm, should be
given frequently. This, in addition to being beneficial to their
general health, has the effect of keeping the legs and cere natural
and of a rich colour, and it is most valuable in the case of an ailing bird.
In giving birds as food that are too large to be bolted whole it is
well, in view of the aviary being unduly littered, to roughly pluck or
remove the coarser feathers, and in supplying rabbits' flesh, to give
a piece, fur and all, with the bone just crushed.
Barn Owl ( Tyto alba)
A very beautiful, curious, and easily managed species whose one
drawback in captivity is that it shows so little during the day time.
It is one of those species that requires a box, or hollow log to nest in.
If disturbed during the daytime places itself in a variety of grotesque
and amusing attitudes.
As a wild bird the Barn Owl, as is well known, is one of our most
useful British birds, a statement I may support by adding that on
visiting a nest placed in a hay loft and containing young, I found not
less than nearly forty mice and voles, but not a single bird.
Long Eared Owl (Asio otus )
I have found this Owl a most attractive and much admired bird to
keep, being looked upon by many people as a great curiosity.
Habits , etc .--In captivity it becomes very tame, but is largely
nocturnal and prefers to sit the day through, bolt upright in some
shady retreat.
Referring to the habits and gregarious nature of the bird when in
a state of nature, it is not unusual in this district during the autumn
months, to discover parties of five or six sitting rigid, tight, and
upright, in a single tree, whilst on one occasion I flushed no less than
twelve, probably two broods, of these curiosities from a small thick pine.

Voice. --As to the note of the species, the young frequently utter
during the evenings for some weeks after leaving the nest a plaintive
mewing call. The adults, during the pairing season, give vent to
an occasional barking or grunting sound.
Tawny Owl (Strix aluco)
Probably the least difficult of the group to keep and, failing the diet
recommended, will thrive upon the coarsest fare. If procured young it
also becomes very tame and makes an excellent children's pet.
As throwing some light upon the varied nature of this bird's food
when in a wild state, I may record that on one occasion I examined
a freshly-killed example whose crop was packed with the larvae of
the Buff-tip Moth ( Pygaera cucephala ). And referring to the newspaper
notices that occasionally appear, describing the boldness of the
species when its young are approached after dark, I may state that
twice I have been the subject of these attacks, the first instance
occurring when passing under trees in which no doubt there were
young. In this case the bird was very crafty and the first intimation
of the attack was the receipt of a thump upon the head, and my
cap being carried to a distance of about ten feet. The bird then
stooped at my head both ways in quick succession, like a trained
Falcon stooping to a lure. Usually she turned or threw up just out of
reach, but finally being without a stick, and searching for my missing
headgear, she got another charge home. Her tactics during this
engagement were remarkable and it was noticeable that when
actually charging she was invariably silent, which meant that in the
uncertain light, the only warning received of her approach was the
current of air produced by her wings.
A second instance took place some years later, and some miles
distant from the first, making it unlikely that it was the same bird.
This concerned an old female that proved bold enough to attack in
the day time and which came and took up her quarters near a young
bird which was being kept as a children's pet. A third instance
which actually came to my notice was the case of a labourer returning
home after dusk having his right of way disputed by an Owl of this
species whose young were sitting upon a stile which he had to cross.
Lap Owl (Scotiaptex lapponica)
For some considerable time, whilst its owner was abroad, we had
the care of an example of this fine Owl.
Appearance. --A large grey hornless bird about the size of an Eagle
Owl.
Hardiness , etc. --Thrived upon a diet of rat and rabbit flesh, had been
upwards of twenty years in confinement, and gave one the impression
of being very hardy and an easily managed bird in captivity.

Snowy Owl (Nyctea nyctea)
For several years a pair of these beautiful northern Owls thrived
here. These taken as young from a nest in Norway during the
summer of 1891, seemed excellently suited as to surroundings,
when kept in a roomy aviary with access to a cool, semi-dark,
thatched shed.
Habits. --Largely diurnal, such examples as we have possessed,
unless wild, have usually spent many hours daily in their outer flight,
sitting upon a log, substantial perch, or large stone. They also, as
can readily be imagined, are never happier or seen to better advantage
than when surrounded with snow.
Constitution , Special Requirements. --Rather delicate in confinement,
requiring carefully catering for, and keeping with access to a cool
shed. It seems advisable also, that they should be able to form
castings daily, and partake of their food from a clean brick or stone
surface swilled daily.
Food. --We find nothing suits them better than freshly killed rats
and rabbits. It is advisable, however, to avoid coarse, old examples
of the former, or portions of the latter that contain milk.
Breeding. --Nested annually for some years (since 1901), and in
spite of the heat being much against both parents and young, have
successfully reared on several occasions.
The first sign of nesting with this pair usually commenced about the
third week in May, by the female making several mock nests or
scratchings in the sand. About this time also, the male, who happened
to be much the more timid bird of the two, began to be bolder, and
by the time the first egg was laid, his whole nature appeared changed,
and instead of spending the greater part of his time in the shed, he
voluntarily came out into the open to mount guard, while by the
time the young were hatched, he was quite fierce and ready to attack
any person passing near, but before this stage was reached, we usually
temporarily covered up the front of their aviary with garden
matting. Besides jealously mounting guard, the male also carried all
food to the female at the nest, who fed the young, while small, by
tearing tiny fragments off with the bill, and offering it to them under
her breast. During this process she is partly standing, and as the
chicks become older, it is noticeable that she frequently accompanies
this feeding with many grunts, and a mantling 1 of the wings.
Nest. --A rubbing in the sand, usually made in the darkest corner
of their shed.
Eggs. --Ovals, about equal to a fowl's egg in size, and of the owl's
usual colour and texture.

222 A. F. MOODY-AN EARLY ACCOUNT OF SOME PERCHING BIRDS
Incubation. --Appears to last about twenty-eight days, and as the
female begins to sit as soon as the first egg is laid, there is naturally
an interval of some days between the leaving of the shell of the first
and last chick. These are reared upon the adult fare, the only
difference made being that for the first week or two food is supplied
liberally, and while still warm.
The writer has no notes available as to when the young matured,
but in the case of the male parent which died at the age of 24J years,
it was noticeable that towards the end of his career, there appeared
to be some slight reversion to the immature plumage. Thus, when in
his prime the bird was absolutely white, except for a few black splashes
on three or four tertiaries on each wing. At his death these were
darker, with the splashes extending to the secondaries and wing
coverts. The female which died at the age of 20 years had for some
time, I believe, been showing a slight change of plumage.
Hawk Owl (Surnia ulula)
A single example for a short time kept here.
Appearance , etc. --A very vigorous, wide awake, and strong footed
bird, requiring a diet similar to the commoner British species.
Tengmalm's Owl ( JEgoliusfunereus)
A male kept for a few months.
A rare and interesting little bird, densely feathered, purely nocturnal,
and a true bird and mouse eater.
Habits , etc. --Similar to the Tawny Owl.

Scops Owl (Otus scops)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998535625" page_id="56289028"  page_num="222" year="" vol="">
About six examples kept.
Appearance. --A quaint and curious tufted species, about the size of
a Thrush.
Habits , etc. --Although sprightly and active enough if disturbed
during the daytime, these Scops were largely nocturnal, and preferred
to spend the day through perched with feathers tightly compressed,
amidst some dead sticks in the most shaded corner of their shed.
When viewed, even under such artificial conditions, it was noticeable
that their peculiar moth-like plumage rendered them difficult to see,
and I should imagine of great protective value when in a state of
nature.
Food , Requirements , etc. --They do best when allowed plenty of
exercise, and fed upon a light diet. Probably largely insect eaters,
and being weak footed and ill adapted to tearing up food, I would
recommend, if anything coarser than mice or Sparrows have to be
supplied, that it be reduced to a mince and placed upon a clean board.

Breeding .--The species has, I understand, been bred in captivity
by Mr. Meade-Waldo, and unfertile eggs have been laid and sat upon
here. These, three or four in number, were creamy white, round,
rather large for the size of the bird, and deposited in a hollow log.
Hardiness. --Appeared to require wintering in a dry, frostproof,
temperature, and suffered if left out of doors too late in the autumn.
Eagle Owl [Bubo bubo)
For years this handsome and frequently kept species was repre-
sented in the collection. It appears to be a free breeder, very hardy,
and long-lived in captivity.
Pigmy Owl (Glaucidium passerinum)
We possessed for some time an example of this miniature species,
which is even less than Scops-giu. It proved to be an active and wide
awake little creature, but could neither bear fasts of a few hours'
duration nor continued cold combined with damp.
Little Owl (Carine noctua)
A few examples kept at different times.
Habits , etc. --Largely diurnal and fond of sunshine, the Little Owl
becomes moderately tame, and is rather an amusing bird to keep.
It also possesses a curious trick of bobbing its head up and down, and
is very quick at disappearing underground as though showing some
affinity to the Burrowing Owls.
Food. --Not such dainty feeders as the Scops and Pigmy, and may
be described as rather large and continuous eaters.
Breeding. --Had no opportunity of nesting here.

By A. A. Prestwich
Recently I had occasion to refer to my notes on prominent
aviculturists of the past, and under the " T's " I noticed W. E.
Teschemaker--probably one of the most successful aviculturists of
all times. He certainly had the avicultural equivalent of " Green
Fingers ". First successes were obtained in his Devonshire aviaries
with almost monotonous regularity over a great many years. Accord-
ing to my compilation they number forty-six--21 British and 25
foreign species. Among the former is the entry : " Hawfinch, 1911,
A.S. Medal (. A.M ., 1912, 28). On this occasion two young ones were
reared.
It then struck me that the Hawfinch had been bred but rarely.
V. A. V. Carr, in lit. 18.4.40, says : " My father has reared them
for three years until they've left their nests, but has never (as yet)
reared them until they can suffice for themselves prior to their moult."
F. J. Lee, of Oxford, reared two, male and female, in an inside aviary
in 1940, teste E. H. Simmons, in lit. 28.8.44.
But by far the most successful with this finch is H. S. Hepburn,
of Jersey, Channel Islands. In answer to my inquiry as to how he
had fared during the war, he wrote : "I am happy to state we are
now settled down once again to a normal life after our sojourn two
and a half years behind the wire in Germany. As you can, no doubt,
imagine, it was indeed a weary and monotonous existence. Naturally
it was very heart-breaking to have to leave our home, birds, and
everything, at such short notice ; in our case, we were given notice
for deportation at 10 o'clock on the Thursday night, and by 4 o'clock
the following day we were on our way to Germany ! Still, we must
be thankful, there were thousands, no doubt, who endured more
than we.
I was indeed sorry to hear on my return home that not one of my
birds had survived, particularly my stock of Hawfinches. These I do
feel the loss of very much, as they are going to be difficult to replace.
I am only too glad to be able to furnish you with more facts regarding
the breeding under control of these very interesting finches. Actually,
I was successful in rearing five of these birds ; three at my first
attempt in 1937, and two in 1939. I also had several nests of young
hatch out in 1938, but failed to rear any that year.
I started with one pair of wild-caught birds in 1937, these reared
their young (two cocks, one hen). The following year (1938) I tried
again with my original pair. No young reared. In 1939 I had three
pairs breeding, these consisted of:--

more, and as the cock also was not interested, that was that !
Note that the single youngsters reared were the survivors of three
and four young respectively. It has often been said that a pair of
finches will not usually rear a single young bird.
In my experience with these birds, I find it easy enough to get
them into condition, build nests, lay clutch after clutch of fertile
eggs, but when the young hatch out it's a different story. It's then
I start to worry. The great difficulty I find is to provide a sufficient
variety of live food. Mealworms were my main standby, with the
addition of small striped snails, which they seemed to relish, also
anything in the way of live food to be found in the garden. Once the
young left the nest they quickly took to mealworms and soaked
sunflower, and were no trouble to rear to the full adult stage."
Should any member know of other successes, I would be interested
to hear particulars.

Being at the present time without a bird in cage or aviary, I turn to
the wild birds in our garden and orchard. Many birds seem to
inhabit this part of Kent, and though my knowledge of British birds
is very limited, I will narrate what I have seen. The first incident
that occurred was one autumn day last year, when I found a lovely
bird caught in the low wire netting that surrounds our hedges to keep
out rabbits. I took it to be a Woodcock, the plumage much resembled
that of the common Pheasant. It had a very long beak, and was a
fairly large bird. After letting it rest in my hand for a few minutes,
I let it fly away.
In the spring the Missel Thrush was the first to sing, but soon
the Pigeons and Doves cooed, and the Magpies could be seen flitting

226 N. WHARTON-TIGAR-WILD BIRD NOTES FROM THE ISLE OF THANET
about at the end of the orchard, repairing their annual nesting place,
Blackbirds and Song Thrushes, Chaffinches, and many others, even
Great Tits, sang, and began courting. In April, to my delight,
I noticed a pair of Goldfinches carrying building material ; they
always flew in the opposite direction and round to the site of their
nest, which turned out to be at the very top of a tall pear tree. The
nest was built, and the cock spent hours on guard in a neighbouring
tree, singing nearly all the time. I could see them from my bedroom
window, and used to jump up at 5 a.m. to watch them. Then a
terrible gale sprang up which lasted for many weeks ; my little pair
vanished, and I have never seen Goldfinches on our premises since,
but saw some flying about in the village in a less exposed position.
In searching for the Goldfinches, I noticed numbers of Linnets in the
front garden, and on looking round found several nests in our ever-
green euonymus hedges. In May the cocks were lovely with red
on their heads, and many had quite rosy red breasts. They are such
graceful little birds, and look brighter and prettier than they do when
caged. When the cock has decided on a spot for the nest, usually not
more than three or four feet above ground, he displays to the hen,
singing not unlike a Violet-eared Waxbill, and seems to ignore one&apos;s
presence, going in and out of the place chosen with nesting material.
But once the nest is built of fibrous roots, and lined with brown woolly
material, and the five speckled greyish blue eggs laid, they are seldom
seen, though the cock can be heard singing not far away.
During incubation, I abstain from going near the nest, but usually
manage to peep in, just at hatching time. The tiny mites look like
black hairy spiders with little open beaks. After this, I again leave
the nest alone till I judge the young are a week or so old, then I look
in every day till one morning they have flown away. The last nest
I had under observation, the young left on 12th August. Some of
these nests, and there were at least eight or ten, were built close to
the veranda. Early in May a Missel Thrush made a round open
nest in the low fork of a pear tree, close to a much used path, so open
and exposed to view, and yet she laid her eggs, and bro ght up her
brood. They found it rather warm at times, and the four youngsters
would pant when the sun shone on the nest. They grew huge, and
were quite unconcerned when we passed close to them, and talked
to them. A Jenny Wren made a big round closed nest in a hedge,
at the back of the house ; I never touched it, as I know they resent it,
but they flew along the hawthorn hedge so often that I soon found it.
The cock sang his loud but quite sweet song while I judged his mate
was sitting, but as I could not look, I cannot be sure. Chaffinches
were constantly feeding young, also many Greenfinches, but I never
found a nest. A green Woodpecker, on wet days especially, would
hunt on the lawn for ants, the green was a dull ohve, showing bright

N. WHARTON-TIGAR-WILD BIRD NOTES FROM THE ISLE OF THANET 227
yellow rump, red top to head, extending down the neck below was
grey. I believe this bird is sometimes called the English Parrot.
The specimen I saw on many occasions may have been a hen, for it
was not brilliantly colour d. A Sparrow Hawk would swoop down
on the lawn, and carry off its prey. Owls flew about at dusk, Jack-
daws passed by in big bands, and the Cuckoo was heard constantly
from April till the end of June. I was very surprised on ist August
to find a lovely young Cuckoo trying to get through some wire netting,
so I caught him. He was a fully feathered youngster rich tan and
black barred plumage, white spot on head, and a little white on
flights and tail. He kept trying to peck me, and showed the brilliant
orange inside to his mouth ; the feet were small and weak for the size
of the bird. He was very calm and fearless. I let him go, and he
could fly perfectly. Next day another baby Cuckoo appeared on the
edge of the back lawn, short tailed and immature, and only able to
hop alon^, and on ioth August, eight days later, another very young
and dazed baby Cuckoo appeared from the same shrubbery, also
only able to hop about ; I saw a Hedge Accentor feeding this one.
I doubt if these last two would ever reach Africa. I recently read
some interesting notes by Ray Palmer. He says in June the " hen
Cuckoo has long finished egg laying ", and mentions that " in her
selected area no other Cuckoo would be allowed to work," and says,
" a female Cuckoo selects prospective foster parents according to
hereditary instinct, and the territory chosen depends on the species
she is in the habit of using. The Hedge Accentor, Meadow Pipit,
Pied Wagtail, and Reed Warbler are the principle birds used by
British Cuckoos, but an individual Cuckoo always keeps to the same
kind by which she herself was reared, and thus we get races of Cuckoos
using certain fosterers. By the middle of June young Cuckoos are
nearing maturity," and so my three youngsters appearing in August
may be somewhat unusual. I took the first youngster I found to be
a young cock, the other two seemed duller in plumage, and might be
females.
It is now late August, and all nesting and feeding is over, and the
garden and orchard no longer are filled with the music of the birds.

Members of the Club, 53 ; Guests, 19 ; Total, 72.
The Chairman, in opening the meeting, said how pleased he was to
see such a large attendance. When the formation of the Club was
first suggested he had been in some doubt as to whether it would prove
the success hoped, but judging from the attendance he need have had
no such misgiving and it was also indicative of the active interest of
the members of the Society. During the last years it had been most
difficult to keep the Avicultural Magazine going, but it had been
kept up to a high standard. To achieve this the Editor had had to
turn to a very large extent for help from abroad and one of those who
had helped perhaps more than any other was Captain Jean Delacour,
and it was a very great pleasure to welcome him once again after his
long absence. Unfortunately some of the films Captain Delacour
had intended to show had been delayed in transit from America ;
this had necessitated an alteration in the programme and he was
greatly indebted to Lt.-Commander Peter Scott, who had kindly
agreed, at very short notice, to show some of his films.

Captain Delacour said that whereas at one time he used to come
to England almost monthly it was now seven years since his last visit.
He was delighted to be in England again, to be present at this meeting
and to see so many old friends--some looking very much the same
as when he last saw them. He greatly regretted that he was unable to
show all the films he had intended, but he was able to show one which
he thought would prove of considerable interest. Entitled " One
Second in the Life of a Humming Bird " and taken in colour with an
ultra-rapid camera, the film proved to be of outstanding interest and
merit. Two species of Humming Birds were shown hovering before a
feeding-bottle, and the rate so slowed down that the complicated
wing movements were clearly discernible.
Lt.-Commander Peter Scott then showed his colour film " Geese of
the World ", in which practically all the species known to aviculture
were included. These had, in the main, been photographed at
Leckford, Lilford, and from his own pre-war collection on the Wash.
Commander Scott briefly described the Wildfowl Observatory he
was developing on the estuary of the Severn and added that he had
the assistance of Mr. John Yealland in this work.

By F. E. Matthews
This year the weather has not favoured my " Many Colors " or
Turquoisine Parrakeets, though they made use of their nest-boxes
and brooded their eggs assiduously. The inconsistent temperature,
with rapid changes from heat to cold, and the all prevailing wind
kept them from flying about, and made their sleeping quarters
desirable.
A pair of Gouldians nested several times with the result that there
are a few lively young birds. Their aviary is fairly sheltered from
the prevailing wind.
I think our Grey Parrot has been most lively. She keeps us all up
to the mark. She thinks we need it ? If she knows anyone is wanted
it can be left to her. She also looks after a Sheltie (sheepdog) at all
times, calling her by name or whistle to keep her near her. Every
meal is announced : if anyone is absent they are called. The weather
is discussed. We are told if it is going to rain. The dog is told to go
and play ball and asked afterwards " if it was nice out there ", "if
it was sunny ? " When supper is over she tells us " Want to go in
the corner and be covered up in the dark ". I never knew a bird so
well up in the time for everything, and so persistent in getting her
will carried out.
In a letter from Kenya, dated 13th June, 1946, my brother writes
of the inmates of his garden. He says he has a number of birds
under observation at present, though not of many new species.
A Heughlin Robin has built this year in a safer place than last year,
he is pleased to say. There are two Sunbird nests of different species,
one is a Malachite, the other not yet identified. It is a funny little
nest near the ground with young birds in it. Two little nests outside
a bedroom window contain young birds--and eggs. A Ruddy Waxbill
has a nest in a creeper outside the dining-room window. We also
have two types of Weavers' nests in various parts of the garden, he
adds.
A black-headed Oriole has built high up in a Cape Chestnut tree
and is a new visitor. They are noisy birds with a monotonous call,
but striking to look at. Another new nest is owned by a Seed-eater--
like a Canary. They are of that family and good songsters. This is,
I think, " Shelleys ". It has built in a Macrocarpa hedge in the
vegetable garden : not a very good place for me (he says) as it loves
peas and they are just coming on.
Bees are an awful nuisance in this country. Last Sunday evening
I had just turned on the wireless to listen to the service at the Cathedral

service in the Cathedral was abandoned as the bees had invaded it.
I have a jolly little wire-haired Terrier. The other day he saw a
chicken in the garden which he recognized as not one of ours--how,
I don't know ? for he never touches ours. Anyway he went for it,
and with difficulty I saved its life after it had lost many feathers.
I gave him his expected beating, and afterwards he ran off to our
little chapel and took refuge at the altar. I suppose he recognized
that he never got into trouble there !

For chlorate of sodium read chloride of sodium. Chlorate is not a poison to
vertebrates but this strength would certainly make them ill, it is, however, a very
deadly plant poison and would kill all herbage plants and bushes for some distance

Additions to the London Zoo
The Council of the Zoological Society of London is sparing no effort to restore the
Society's collection of birds to its pre-war very high level. During the past few months
there have been many additions, and numerous gaps have been filled. In these days
of bird scarcity and near-empty aviaries, it is indeed a treat to visit the Parrot and
Small Bird Houses. The pleasure of seeing so many former favourites represented is
perhaps slightly marred by envy. We must perforce exercise patience, but surely the
day cannot now be very far distant when birds will be once more available to the
aviculturist. But let it be soon !
The following are the more important recent additions.
June.--The Society's collector, A. G. Bennett, brought 11 Picui Doves, 3 Green
Cardinals, 3 Silky Cowbirds, 12 Falkland Island Turkey Vultures, 6 Brazilian
Carrion Hawks, 2 Burrowing Owls, 1 Red-backed Buzzard, 5 Upland Geese, and

August.--The most important arrivals were 2 Sharp-winged Teal {Anas flavirostris
oxyptera) of Southern Peru, new to the collection, 2 Cornish Choughs, 2 Puffins,
1 Black-billed Tree Duck, 2 Grey-necked Crowned Cranes, and 1 Demoiselle Crane.
The Whipsnade additions include 3 Upland Geese, 5 Canada Geese, and 4 Common

One very important bird has died in the Parrot House, Sydney Porter's Norfolk
Island Parrakeet (Cyanoramphus nova-zelandia cookii). The species is believed to be

The following extract is taken from Z** News, September-October, 1945, issued
by the Royal Zoological Society of South Australia, in continuation of the extract
made in the May-June number of the Avicultural Magazine :--
In two previous issues, we outlined various characteristic movements peculiar to
sundry species of birds, dealing with :
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999606333333333" page_id="56289038"  page_num="232" year="" vol="">
1. Actions of a utilitarian nature.
2. Those of a display nature. We now come to :
3. Actions of obscure significance.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99949735" page_id="56289038"  page_num="232" year="" vol="">
Here again, such movements are practically confined to the bird world, or so it
would seem from observations made in the Zoo.
In some cases movement seems to be involuntary or at least sub-conscious, but in
others it is actuated by the voluntary participation of the bird in some ritual
performance, game, or other communal activity.
Subconscious or involuntary action is exemplified by the following birds :--Water
Hens, Coots, Moorhens, and Rails. Most people are familiar with the habit these
birds have of flicking the tail.
Kestrels and Plovers.--These are birds of widely divergent species, yet they each
have a habit of " bobbing " the head. It is difficult to assign a reason for this
characteristic movement, but it is an interesting point that it is common to two birds
so very different from each other. Pratincole.---This bird is a relative of the Plover
and " bobs " its head too. It also has a peculiar habit of rocking the body while
standing, as if it were having difficulty in maintaining its balance.
Our popular little friend, the Willie Wagtail, has a way of flicking his wings. This
is usually done during his insect-catching activities in the short intervals when he is
perching or running. Its significance seems obscure, unless it is his way of keeping the
wings ready for instant use.
The various Curassows, large South American birds, all have a peculiar way of
shaking the head. There is nothing to indicate what useful purpose this fulfils. Then
there are the Shags and Cormorants that can be seen sitting on piles, buoys, etc., with
outspread wings and steadily " gargling ". Doubtless the wings are spread for the
purpose of drying those members or to get full benefit of basking in the sun, but for
what purpose is the " gargling " ? _
Some birds indulge in activities which seem to be in the nature of ritual
performances. Such performances might be done by one, two, or more individuals.
The various species of Bower Birds are well known for their peculiarity of building
" bowers ". These vary in structure according to species. Birds in the Zoo have
often built bowers. The bower is not a nest but a form of playground ; the nest is a
different structure of what might be termed orthodox type. The bower is built on the
ground and is composed of small sticks which the bird places or weaves together in
such a way as to form a bower or passageway with vertical sides. The bower is then
adorned with objects such as snail shells, broken china (if available) and other things
that take its fancy. It is an interesting fact that Bower Birds are specially attracted by
blue objects. The bower and its " fittings " are frequently adjusted and rearranged
to the accompaniment of strange noises and peculiar antics.
Apropos Bower Birds being fond of blue objects, the writer recently put some blue
lobelia flowers in a case where there was a bower. The " proprietor " of the bower
immediately picked up a flower, but, before placing it in the bower, carefully removed
several green leaves attached to it.

Other birds, such as Gulls, at times indulge in noisy vociferations to the
accompaniment of much bowing to each other. Penguins perform a somewhat similar
display except that the body is held erect and the head pointed upwards. It is difficult
to know just what these manifestations mean. They do not appear to be done
in play nor can they signify hostility, as no blows or pecks are exchanged.
Cranes form another group of birds which indulge in strange antics. The community
dance of the Australian Crane (also known as Brolga or Native Companion) is well
known. Other examples could be quoted but space does not permit.
The significance of many activities is obscure but in some cases, perhaps, they
could be attributed to playfulness. Nature endows most young mammals with an
urge to play, and in this way ensures necessary exercise in their critical developmental
stages. This does not, however, appear to be the case in the world of birds, although
there might be exceptions such as young Emu chicks which will run about in the
peculiar erratic manner of their parents. This might be a form of play. Certain birds
in adult form definitely do play. The Caiques roll on the ground and " wrestle "
with each other, as also do the Lorikeets. The Kea loves to hop about and play with
various objects.
Other peculiarities of the bird world are evidenced by the Mot Mots, which
deliberately remove portion of the vane from some of their tail feathers. This is not
attributable to the feather-plucking " vice " often acquired by Cockatoos confined in a
small cage.
Thus, while we are left in doubt as to the reason for much that birds do, they
offer an absorbing subject for observation, speculation, and study.

in particular, our two lady Officers who are so gallantly carrying on the duties of
Editor and Secretary and Treasurer, respectively, for my pleasure and interest ?--

I can imagine what a wonderful relief it would be to the two ladies in question,

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed
account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from the date
of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the Executive
Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the
young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent
of their parents. No medal can be given for the breeding of hybrids, or of local
races or sub-species of species that have already been bred.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine
before it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of
the young, and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the
Medal is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have
been awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures 2J inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to [name of recipient ] for rearing the young of [name of
species ], a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom."
The Council may grant a special medal to any member who shall succeed
in breeding any species of bird that has not previously been bred in captivity in
Europe.

THE CHINESE AVICULTURIST
By Alastair Morrison
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999705548387097" page_id="56289081"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
The keeping of wild birds in captivity, whether for pleasure, sport
or profit, is a practice which dates far back into human history.
Inevitably the Chinese people have developed their own techniques
in this matter, some of which differ radically from Western methods
of aviculture. These methods can be very well studied in Peking
where all the photographs illustrating the article were taken. Although
the kinds of birds kept in other parts of China may vary the methods
remain the same, and so, although this article is mainly based on
observations made in Peking, one would come to very much the same
conclusions anywhere else in China.
The most radical differences between Western and Chinese methods
of aviculture are to be found in the treatment of song and other birds
kept for the sake of the aesthetic pleasure which their possession affords.
Whereas the Western aviculturist endeavours to keep his pets under
the most natural conditions possible, the Chinese makes no attempt to
do anything of the sort. In the West the criterion of a good bird cage
is its size, the amount of room the inmate has to move and fly about
in, and the ease with which the cage can be cleaned and the bird fed
from the outside. A good cage is a bulky, awkward thing, nearly
always of a box shape and not easily moved from place to place.
Chinese cages, on the other hand, are almost invariably circular in
shape, very small and lightly built of bamboo, and the dimensions are
governed by rigid convention. There is a standard size for nearly every
commonly kept species of bird, and what differences are to be seen
are mainly those of ornamentation, which vary to suit the purse of the
buyer. Feeding and cleaning cannot be done from the outside, and to
do this the bird has usually to be run into another cage. It is usually
impossible to introduce a satisfactory bird bath into the cage.
Since the cages are so small, it naturally follows that only tame and
steady birds can live in them satisfactorily. This the Chinese achieve
through forcible taming, by a very effective, if somewhat brutal,

process. The newly caught bird first has its wing tips tied together and
the tail bound so that it cannot flutter or damage the large feathers.
It is then tethered by the neck to a small perch with a piece of string
which does not allow much play. If the bird is frightened and jumps
off the perch it hangs by the neck and slowly strangles, but is quickly
replaced on the perch as someone must be in attendance the whole
time. It is surprising how quickly, within a day or two, the bird
learns not to move off the perch and ignores the presence of any
number of people around it. Feeding the bird presents no problem in
the case of finches, which take seed naturally, but insectivorous birds
have to learn to take small pieces of raw meat in place of the insects
to which they are accustomed. At first the meat is ignored and the
bird dealer must stand patiently by, gently knocking a small stick
with a piece of meat at the end against the bird's bill. Usually the
bird ends up by snapping at the meat and swallowing it once it is in
its bill. Particularly obstinate individuals are taken in the hand and
the throat gently squeezed until the bill gasps open and the meat can
be pushed down the gullet. It is doubtful whether the Chinese ever
fail to get a newly caught bird to feed. Water is supplied by means of
a rag at the end of a stick which is soaked in water and flicked against
the bird's bill. As soon as the bird can feed itself freely, a food pot,
which contains a mixture of maize-meal and bits of raw meat, is
attached to the end of the perch and the bird is kept thus for a couple
of months or so until it is tame enough to be put into a cage.
The above methods may be taken as being typical for Ruby-throats
{Calliope) and Blue-throats ( Luscinia suecica) , two of the most commonly
kept soft-billed birds in North China. Less commonly kept are the

are never confined in cages and are kept tethered permanently. Par-
ticular favourites of the Chinese are the Marsh and Great Tits and they
achieve remarkable success in keeping these birds, which are considered
rather difficult by Western fanciers. Tits are sometimes kept per-
manently tethered.
Other birds which are forcibly tamed are the various Finches such
as Hawfinches ( Coccothraustes and Eophona ), Crossbills, Bramblings, and
Redpolls. They are mostly taught to do tricks such as catching a ball,
thrown high up in mid-air, and telling fortunes. For the latter the
bird flies to a box, which it opens by pressing a spring, and then selects
a card with a Chinese character on it, which it brings to its master and
from which the fortune is deduced. These trick birds are always kept
hungry and are rewarded with a few seeds when the feat is performed.
Perhaps the commonest cage bird in North China is the Siskin

(i Spinus ) but it is not tamed forcibly as the bird is so tame naturally as
to render the process unnecessary. Other kinds of birds, Buntings,
Rosefinches, Thrushes, Zosterops, Crow-tits ( Suthora webbiana ),
Sparrows, and many more are brought into the market, but the Peking
Chinese take little interest in them, although the Zosterops and
Suthora are commonly kept in Shanghai.
There is, however, a certain demand for these commoner species by
devout Buddhists who gain merit by releasing captive birds.
A rather special category of birds is that of the Larks which are kept
all over China. In the north the species most commonly seen is the
Mongolian Lark ( Melanocorypha mongolica ), a wonderful mimic and
songster. Most of them are brought down from Mongolia while they
are still nestlings, though the best singers are said to be winter caught
adults, which have a purer song with less of the town noises--such as
the mewing of cats and the chattering of Sparrows--which hand-reared
specimens introduce to their repertoire. In Peking a few other Larks
are kept occasionally ( Alauda , Galerida, Calandrella) , but they do not
equal the Mongolian species in popularity. Larks are never tamed
forcibly and are kept in the usual round cages, but with sand on the
floor and a little platform in the middle, on which they stand to sing,
instead of a perch. Some Lark cages are very ornate and up to three
feet in height. The latter feature, however, is a mere matter of show,
and actually it is almost unknown to see a Lark fluttering upwards in
such a sky-scraper, save in fright.
Another bird which is brought to Peking, but from the south, is
the Spectacled Laughing Thrush or Hwa-mei ( Trochalopteron canorum ),
undoubtedly the finest song bird in China and one of the finest in the
world. A good Hwa-mei is very highly priced anywhere in China and
always commands a good price. In a wild state it is a pugnacious bird
and in captivity is very willing to sing in rivalry to any other male of
the same species. As a result it is a common sight to see a group of
fanciers in a teashop with their pets hung up fairly close to each other
and singing magnificently one against the other, while their owners
discuss their relative merits. The Chinese fancier always likes to have
his pets with him, and since the cages are so light they are often carried
about on walks and excursions, a very charming practice which is
unknown elsewhere. The Hwa-mei is not, as far as I know, forcibly
tamed. The cages are often kept covered when they are being moved
about or to induce the birds to sing. A Chinese fancier out walking
with a Hwa-mei cage in his hand, always swings the cage vigorously
to and fro. This probably induces a certain amount of steadiness as
the bird must have to hang on like grim death to prevent being thrown
about the cage. A bird that is commonly kept in the south, though
never seen in Peking, is the Dyal Bird.
There is one feature, however, of Chinese aviculture which is

extremely disagreeable and that is the enormous mortality amongst
birds brought into the market. Save for the more valuable species,
such as Larks and Hwa-meis, prices are ridiculously low, and great
numbers are bought by ignorant school children, coolies, and others as
a passing novelty. Taking the market as a whole, it would in all
probability be a conservative estimate to say that at least 95 per cent
of the birds to be seen die within a space of two or three months or less.
It is a curious inconsistency that the Chinese are amongst the most
skilful, and at the same time the most brutal, people in the world in
their treatment of cage birds.
In addition to the keeping of cage birds the Chinese excel in two
other forms of aviculture of a more utilitarian and sporting nature,
falconry and Cormorant fishing. Falconry, the practice of training
various kinds of tame hawks for the chase, is a very ancient form of
sport. With the introduction of the modern sporting gun, falconry has
declined or disappeared in most parts of the world, but it is still well
established in North China ; and, indeed, with the present restrictions
on the use of firearms, it is said to be more popular than for many
years past. The birds used are all passage hawks, caught when adult
during the autumn migration and, to a lesser extent, during the
spring, since practically none of the better sporting hawks are resident
in the area. Perhaps the most popular species is the Goshawk, of
which immature birds are preferred to adults and the large females
to the smaller males. The Goshawk can be trained to take hares,
Partridges, and other game. A great many Sparrowhawks (both the
Eastern form of the European species and the much smaller Accipiter
gularis are also brought into the market and are trained to take small
birds. The true falcons are rarely seen and are very costly. An occa-
sional Merlin, Hobby, Peregrine, or Shanghar (Falco cherrug) are
sometimes obtainable, but no attempt seems to be made to train
Eagles as in Imperial times. Methods of training are very much the
same as in Europe ; the same hoods to cover the head, and jesses or
holding thongs attached to the legs. One great advantage in the
Chinese system, however, is that the falconer continually carries his
hawk with him wherever he goes, which greatly improves the docility
and tractability of the bird. In addition to hawks, the Chinese also
train the larger Shrikes to take small birds.
Rather similar to falconry, though carried out in a different element
and for purely commercial purposes, is the employment of tame
Cormorants for fishing. It is doubtful if any of the birds used are wild
caught and they are probably all hand reared from the nest. I also
believe that the Chinese breed them in captivity, though I have not
actually observed this myself. In any case they are perfectly tame.
They learn to fish naturally but are prevented from swallowing any
fish, save of the smallest size, by a straw ring round the neck. Whenever

a large fish is caught which cannot be swallowed, it is taken away from
the bird which is rewarded with a very small fish. When the bird has
caught and been rewarded with so many fish that it loses interest in
fishing it is hoisted out of the water with a large net and replaced by
another bird. It is a very quaint and charming sight to see a sampan
with a dozen or so of these ungainly birds ranged along its sides awaiting
their turn to fish, a perpetual reminder of Chinese ingenuity and
avicultural skill.

Mr. G. Rowland Hutchinson, Hon. Secretary of the Avicultural
Society of New Zealand has forwarded the following account of the
rearing of the Kiwi in captivity, published in The Aukland Star on 7th
October, 1946 :--
" The Kiwi family domiciled at the Hawke's Bay Acclimatization
Society's game farm at Greenmeadows was increased yesterday by
one. For the past seventy-odd days the male bird was engaged in
hatching the egg, and his family group numbers four.
Twelve months ago a notable achievement at the game farm was
the breeding and rearing in captivity of the first Kiwi chick. Since
then constant observations have been made by the society's curator,
Mr. F. D. Robson, and as a result many previously believed facts have
gone by the board. Much new information has been secured on the
habits of New Zealand's national bird.
Since the hen bird began laying four years ago she has produced
eleven eggs. Many prominent writers had held to the belief that Kiwi
hens laid only one egg a year, but this particular bird produced four
in the first year she started laying. Unfortunately the eggs were in-
fertile. The three eggs produced the following year saw the embryo
die in the shell. Last year two Kiwi chicks were hatched out--the first
time in history that such a result had been achieved. Later one of
the chicks died through contracting paralysis of the neck, which
prevented it feeding satisfactorily and caused it to lose its balance.
The second chick thrived on the attention it received, and from a diet
of a mere half-pound of worms daily it has to-day, at the age of 12
months, reached proportions of half those of the adult birds.
Observations made by Mr. Robson on his charges are interesting
and valuable. The female apparently t kes three to five years to
mature, and her eggs weigh approximately one pound, or a quarter of
the bird's weight. The chick which survived weighed half a pound
when it emerged from the shell and was fully feathered on hatching.
Once the eggs were laid the mother bird discarded further marital

responsibilities, and the duties of hatching the eggs devolved on the
male bird, which, like the male ostrich, has fully developed maternal
instincts. Mr. Robson states that the hatching process involves a
period of between 75 and 80 days.
Claims that a Kiwi chick is independent once it leaves the shell are
refuted by Mr. Robson, who states that the chick did not leave the
nest until it was four days old, nor did it start foraging for food until it
had reached the age of six days.
Mr. Robson has made a careful study of the birds during the period
they have been in his care, and his notes and comments should prove
valuable data in the compilation of a more authentic history of New
Zealand's national bird."
The following further details were given in the New Zealand press
in an article by " Naturalist " also published in October, 1946 :--
" The male adult Kiwi was found nearly fourteen years ago in a bin in
a Napier wool scouring works, and ultimately it found a haven at the
game farm. Apparently it had been kept as a pet in the first case
until it had made its escape. The Kiwi hen came out of the bush
north of Napier, having been rescued as a chick from a bush-fire.
This was between four and five years ago, and it was while the pair
was in the care of the curator that representations were made to the
Minister of Internal Affairs to allow the society to retain possession
of the birds and conduct breeding experiments with the pair--the
first of their kind in New Zealand.
Happily the Minister saw eye to eye with the society, and as a result
of the passing of special legislation permitting the birds to remain in
the society's possession the Kiwis were mated. For four years the hen
bird had laid eggs--four the first year (1943), three in 1944, two last
year, and two again this year--but from the eleven eggs only two chicks
have survived.
In the first year the eggs produced were much lighter than the 1 lb.
eggs laid this year, and it is thought that this might have been respon-
sible for their infertility. In 1944 the experiment again failed, but last
year both eggs were hatched out after an incubation period of between
75 and 80 days. To-day one of the chicks is fast growing and is thriving
on the care bestowed on him. He is approximately half the size of his
parents and has shown no backward tendencies. This was the first
chick after three years of careful experiment to be bred and reared in
captivity in New Zealand.
The second chick bred last year was not so fortunate, as, while still
very young, it contracted paralysis of the neck, which prevented its
feeding. It could travel in circles only, and later it died. Every effort
was made by the curator to save the chick, even to the extent of
constructing a special feeding trough to suit the peculiar deformity of
the bird's neck.

The curator estimates that the female bird at the farm reached
maturity at the age of four years, but he inclines to the belief that this
is a little early. The bird did not appear to be fully grown when it
started to lay, and this may have been responsible for the smallness of
the first eggs. This year, with the hatching of a lusty chick, believed
at present to be a female, the continuity of the family at the game
farm should be assured, as the first chick hatched was a cock bird.
When they emerge from the shell the chicks are fully feathered
and perfectly formed. Both weighed approximately half a pound,
while the egg itself, at one pound weight, is more than a quarter of
the mother's weight.
Another observation made by Mr. Robson is that even when a chick
has left the shell it is not independent of its parent, as has been pre-
viously claimed. Before it is four days old the chick cannot leave the
nest, nor can it start its own foraging before it is six days old. Dis-
claimed also is the statement that the cock bird does not burrow into
the ground. Other points made by the curator show that the incuba-
tion period is between 75 and 80 days ; the eggs measure 2^ in. in
diameter, 5I in. in length and their correct weight should be about
one pound ; the average life of a Kiwi is around the 25-year mark ;
at the age of 12 months the elder chick still shows a marked disinclina-
tion to leave its father, who very savagely attacks the youngster if he
ventures too near his younger sister; the youngsters are voracious
eaters and from the time they commence to feed a diet of half a
pound of worms daily has to be increased as they grow older."
Mr. R. Forster, of Hawkes Bay, interviewed Mr. Robson and has
sent the following notes :--
" The Kiwi made a nest just like a fowl's nest, only under the box
instead of in it. There was a hole in one end of the box giving access
to the sitting Kiwi. All the story books tell you that Kiwis live on
worms which they pull out of the ground ; well, the principal food
of the young Kiwis was gentles bred by putting fish-heads into the
ground, waiting until they were well blown, and then covering them
with soil. The Kiwis then helped themselves to the diet of gentles.
The Kiwis peck strangers and, according to Mr. Robson, have ' a
kick like a horse '. The male bird is very dark and the hen considerably
lighter coloured feathers. The male bird apparently does most of the
work of hatching and looking after the young, and during this period
is not adverse to having a good fight with the hen. The story books
also say that Kiwis are nocturnal, but Mr. Robson is of the opinion
that they have very poor sight even at night. A test was made by
taking a bird quite a long way from its track, and when released the
bird zig-zagged all over the area until it found its track, down which
it raced at a very high speed."

THE CHARM OF SMALL WADERS IN
CAPTIVITY
By Jean Marie Dersgheid
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999247975" page_id="56289092"  page_num="8" year="" vol="">
Translated and reprinted from Aviornis, Encyclopedic international de UElevage No. 4
November, 1942. by permission of the Editor. (This article was written by the late
Dr. Derscheid during his imprisonment in Brussels.)
In the course of my career as an aviculturist I have kept, in cages,
in aviaries, or in enclosures, many different species of waders, from
most of the indigenous species to rarities originating in the tropical
regions of Brazil or Oceania, from the minute Rails of Africa or
America to the giant Cranes of India or those great Herons of tropical
regions, from the species most easy to keep like our Lapwings and
Oystercatchers to the birds which are difficult such as the splendid
Trumpeters or Sun Bitterns of South America ; certain species such as
Avocets, and various Sandpipers were successfully reared here arti-
ficially from the egg to the adult stage. Many waders are extremely
pleasing in captivity and most of them have distinct personality. All
are very interesting to observe and study--comparing their astounding
diversity in shape, manners and temperament--but I do not think
that in these numerous respects there is a more captivating group than
the little waders of the shore--the Limicolae--of the European fauna.
Also I can hardly understand why these birds figure so rarely in the
collections of aviculturists and at our public exhibitions. It is only in
Zoological gardens that one can see the species more cr less regularly
shown in sufficient numbers (if not in variety), and their presentation,
the surroundings in which they live, is not generally anything meriting
special attention and they therefore usually pass unnoticed by the
general public, the Zoo at Amsterdam being in this respect a happy
exception.
There are three methods of keeping little waders in captivity.
Firstly one can keep them in a cage, either one alone or two of the
same species together ; it is naturally necessary that the cage should
be adapted for their special needs and above all be sufficiently spacious,
the length being of far more importance than the width or the height ;
these birds do not perch at all. For the smallest species a cage 80 cm.
long is the minimum below which one must not go if one wishes to
ensure the comfort of its active inhabitants. The Limicolae are,
however, such restless and sociable birds that it is rather cruel to
impose on them such a restricted captivity without having a special
reason (as for example showing them at an Exhibition of Gage Birds).
In all circumstances it is necessary to see that these caees are always
kept scrupulously clean, that the floor is kept covered with something
soft for their sensitive feet (peat and moss frequently changed are the

best in this respect) and finally that the birds have constant oppor-
tunity to bathe or paddle in a shallow but large receptacle of
fresh water.
The second method is to keep them at semi-liberty in a wire enclosure
with open top, or in a walled garden ; this method is favoured by a
good many people and has given excellent results in some cases, the
birds finding for themselves, and to their great benefit, the major
portion of their food in the form of worms, insects, molluscs and other
pests. The objection might be raised that in the case of the smallest
species one could not see them often or near to, and that they remain
or become wild again under these particular conditions. The principal
drawback, in our country at least, lies in the fact that it is essential in
this case to pinion the birds which deprives them of the'r principal
means of defence against their enemies, such as diurnal and nocturnal
birds of prey, small wild animals, prowling cats, etc. Moreover,
certain species (especially in the Rail family) are sufficiently adroit at
climbing along their enclosures without having to take flight, which
increases the risk of escape of such inhabitants.
Without hesitation I give preference to the system of keeping waders
in specially constructed closed avairies. These aviaries can be as
large as you like and in this case are admirable for the maintenance
of a numerous collection of various species ; and this presents no
difficulties because waders, almost without exception, are of nice
disposition and can live even in a most heterogenous community
without risk of serious dispute.
It may be preferred to place these birds in a series of smaller aviaries
each containing a different species, comprising several birds or a
single pair ; by adopting this last method one has the greatest chance
of their breeding in captivity, a success of which every aviculturist
has the right to be proud.
Whatever dimensions may be adopted for the aviaries for waders
they should conform to the following conditions which are indispen-
sable for the well-being of the occupants.
Although it is a good thing that the major portion of the top of the
avairy should be open to the sky (simply covered, like the sides, with
wire netting of a small mesh) my experience has proved that an enclosed
shelter is absolutely necessary in the case of almost all waders. It is
indeed a peculiarity of these birds (including the species living nor-
mally in the coldest zones of the globe and visiting our regions only
during the coldest weather) to be astonishingly unresistant--propor-
tionally--to damp cold and if not to wind certainly to draughts.
Is it because in an aviary their less active mode of life, above all
with regard to flight, slows up their physiological functions and reduces
their resistance to inclement weather ? Is it because the rigours of
climate to which they are exposed when at liberty on our shores are of

a different nature (dryer cold ?) than that with which they have to
contend with in an enclosure ? Finally is it that in their natural
habitat they are better and more easily able to find proper shelter in
which to take cover ? Whatever it may be, it is cruel and senseless to
try to make most of these birds pass the winter out of doors without
special protection, even those which do not live in Belgium at this
season, and this particularly applies to species originating from more
temperate countries ! Their aviary therefore should include a good
covered shelter hermetically closed on all sides except that which
communicates with the main wire enclosure or run. This side could
be made of a glass door which can be shut at night during bad weather
to keep the occupants inside ; it is not as if they belonged to a species
which is sufficiently robust and hardy that one can take the risk of
relying on their good sense to use the shelter voluntarily and the door
can therefo e always be open or even dispensed with.
Three other important points in the construction of the shelter are
its complete impermeability to draughts, sufficient light--without
which the birds will refuse to go in--and a good litter as floor covering ;
finely crushed peat, or failing that coarse sawdust is the best and
remains clean and fresh for quite a long time ; hay and straw are to
be avoided--above all as generators of a serious infectious disease,
aspergillosis. Sand is also no use as it stays damp and irritates the
particularly sensitive feet of the birds of this category.
My personal observations have already shown me that it is very
important to choose judiciously the material of which the floor of the
wader aviary, including the run, is composed.
The " sand " or " fine gravel " of the Rhine, excellent though it is
as a covering for enclosures for most other birds, is not satisfactory in
this case, because the coarse grains, with rough sharp edges, seem either
to scratch the underside of the toes or get in the folds of the toe joints,
resulting in swellings, inflammations, and local infections which are
always very difficult to cure. The very fine sand from the sea, or silver
sand, does not cause the same troubles, at least not to the same degree,
when it is moist. Clay has the great drawback of dirtying everything
including the feathers of the birds themselves and the water in their
pools. I have obtained the best results by covering the original soil
in my aviaries with a mixture or " composition " made of three parts
white sea-sand, very fine and soft, one part of garden earth with no
clay in it, and one part peat finely crushed, first having been well
soaked in water. To this mixture may be added ad libitum pebbles or
stones from the river, flat or rounded of all sizes. It is equally excellent
to make a very special effort that a considerable part of the surface of
the aviary should be covered with fine good turf cut close almost over
the whole area so that it is kept as smooth as possible, except when
the birds appear ready to breed.

A good aviary for waders should not be thickly planted with trees
or shrubs, at most one or two bushes should be planted which are
useful in giving a little shade to the occupants. I recommend in this
respect two marsh species, Myrica gale (a native of Campine especially)
and Betula nana , a dwarf birch of arctic regions ; certain dwarf willows
(Salix) are equally satisfactory as also a dwarf rhododendron of
China (. Rhododendron hippohaoides) , which has small leaves, does not
attain more than I metre in height and has very pretty flowers of blue
tinged with pink. The Sea Buckthorn (. Hippopha rhamnoides ) is an
equally excellent shrub in this respect. Some large clumps of sea-reeds
and rushes planted here and there in the sand, make a wonderful
finish to the decorative vegetation of the aviary, where one can arrange
by means of different levels of soil to give an impression of miniature
dunes which is most pleasing to the eye.
Another fundamental point is that of water.
Construction of the Pool in the Aviary
It goes without saying that a simple pond is not sufficient for the
well-being, or even for the simplest needs of birds which spend most
of their existence with their feet normally in water. Each aviary must
therefore be provided with a pool, either in the form of a little pond--
round or oblong, or in the form of a stream. The essential point is
that the sides should be very gradually sloped, in such a way as to
make all shades of depth from the centre of the pool to the dry firm
earth. This can be achieved by giving the bottom of the pond a very
gentle slope ; it is perhaps even better to arrange the sides in the form
of wide steps with very little difference in height. In this case I
strongly recommend that along each of these steps a ridge or stop
of one or two centimetres projecting upwards is constructed. This
enables the length of the step to be covered with a layer of fine sand
which is a great advantage for the delicate feet of the birds. This is
presuming naturally that the pool is made of cement or concrete,
which is almost always the only solution possible. It is indeed rare
to have the opportunity of constructing an aviary for waders on a
little natural pond or on a little stream constantly flowing at all
seasons.
Concerning the precautions to be taken in the actual construction of
artificial ponds, take special care that the concrete is sufficiently thick
(io to 15 cm. thick is not at all too much) and that it is placed on a
bed of hard and porous material (clinkers, broken bricks, etc.). Without
this you run the risk of the pond partly rising out of the earth in hard
frosts, which results in cracks and crevices which are very difficult to
repair. Another important point is to ensure that the superficial layer
of cement should be of as fine a texture as possible ; this reduces the
loss of water by infiltration and the smooth surface of such cement

does not hurt the feet of the waders as does uneven concrete roughly
worked.
It is also important that the pond should not be too deep, even in
the centre, so that you reduce the volume of water required to fill it
and make its frequent renewal more easy. This can best be ensured by
means of a little tap running with, if possible, a small but constant flow
of water ; the overflow can be directed to some absorbent ditch or
hidden well situated outside the aviary.

One year I had a brood of late hatched Gouldian Finches, and as the
weather turned bitterly cold the cage was brought indoors and put in
the kitchen. All the young ones became very tame, but the smallest
of all was also the cheekiest and most confident. He would jump on to
my hand when I was changing seed dishes or on to millet sprays and
would stay there if I took them out, without any fear. He was at first
called " Phil Garlick ", but afterwards he was known as Phillip. He
lived for over thirteen years and was known to a great many people
including many aviculturists. Phillip grew cheekier and when he had
moulted into his adult plumage he was given a cage to himself and
promoted to the living room. He knew his name and would answer
at once if I called him. He also knew the sound of the car and would
start his special call, used for me only, as soon as he heard the car
come in or a door open. He showed a great liking for me and would
twist his tail and call again and again, jumping on my hand if I put
it into his cage.
Once when I was telephoning my wife she thought Phillip showed
signs of recognizing my tones so she held the receiver to his cage,
whereupon I called to him and he answered with his special call and
showed himself off as he did when he saw me in person. Quite soon
this was not enough and he began to dance to me, giving the head
shaking that Gouldians do to their mates, followed by the hopping
dance and sweet silent song. We used to say to him " Spring, Phillip,
spring ! " He loved to show off, and performed his song and dance to
many people. They included Women's Institutes, the Malvern Field
Club (this was duly reported in the Malvern Gazette ), and to many
callers. He did not mind at all being taken from home in his cage to
give his performance, and though he would occasionally dance and

sing for other people he liked, it was amazing to see such a scrap show
such marked preference as he did for me.
He had sundry adventures in his life. We used to let him out to fly
round the room and he used to like to settle on my head or shoulders.
Then he would tug at my coat collar in a most determined manner.
One day my wife let him out and he escaped through a partly opened
window. He flew into a bush outside our garden and dropped into a
bed of nettles. I came along and caught him easily, but for the rest of
the day he kept twitching his legs and fluffing out his feathers in a vain
attempt to get rid of the nettle stings. Another time he was perched on
my hand being photographed, but the click of the camera startled
him and he flew away high into an elm tree near. The height must
have made him giddy and he dropped into the grass and was picked
up quite unharmed. Our household got so attached to Phillip that we
always took him with us on our holidays. On the first journey he
showed such interest in a " Stop me and buy one " ice cream that my
wife said " Well, Phillip, try some ", and gave him a taste. He loved it,
and for the rest of the journey to Devon showed the greatest interest in
any paper rustling that went on. Of course, this was made into an
excuse for stopping for ice cream : " Phillip would like an ice if you see
a man " used to come from the back of the car. He preferred vanilla
and definitely refused rather special coffee and chocolate ones, and
wasn't too keen on strawberry. Vanilla--Walls or Eldorado--was
his choice. He also liked dragees well ground up, and during the war
when ice cream failed we kept a few of these for him in an old tea
caddy near his cage. He knew where they were kept. He also knew
my wife usually gave them to him, and if he didn't have his ration late
at night he would positively demand it : Whenever he saw my wife
going towards the tea caddy he got very interested--cupboard love, I
am afraid, as he used to hiss at her in between whiles.
I once gave Phillip an equally dainty little wife ; she also was very
tame and would fly round the room and alight on the tea table to
have a taste of butter. The pair built themselves a nest, but alas she
came to an untimely end through egg-binding trouble. Phillip did not
appear to miss her, he preferred humans really !
He never grew to a large bird, but was always small and dainty, of
beautiful feather and colour, a black-head. Towards the end of his
life he got rather feeble, until at last he could not get on to his perch,
and one day just before Christmas I missed his usual call as I came in
and I found him dead on the floor of his cage.
I miss his cheery little call and ever friendly greeting. I can
thoroughly recommend any of our readers to tame a baby Gouldian
for a really sweet pet, georgeous to behold, whose song is faint and
delightful and never becomes wearisome. I can speak as one who has
kept pets of all kinds, even a mongoose, baby leopards, and antelopes.

NOTES AND COMMENTS FROM NEW ZEALAND
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992448" page_id="56289098"  page_num="14" year="" vol="">
By Rev. H. Ranston, M.A., Litt.D.
There is a form of the Eastern Rosella Parrakeet ( Platycercus eximius)
known as the Splendid or Golden-mantled Rosella (Pl. ex. splendidus).
It is found north of the Darling Downs in New South Wales. Instead
of the pale yellowish green of the common form the feathers of the
mantle are a beautiful golden-yellow. Moreover the colouring of the
plumage is more rich and brilliant, so that it is indeed a very beautiful
bird. While in Australia this bird is found in one particular locality,
there are reasons for doubting whether it is only a local race.
In the Waitakere ranges, a few miles from Auckland, the Eastern
Rosella has been naturalized for many years and has become so
numerous as to do damage in the orchards. A considerable number of
them are trapped and find their way into the bird shops. The great
majority are of the common form. In the case of others there is a much
brighter mantle plumage and not rarely there are birds so golden
yellow in the feathers of the mantle and so much richer in the colora-
tion of the whole plumage as to answer to the descriptions of PL ex.
splendidus. Now undoubtedly the Eastern Rosella came into the
Dominion as a cage bird and at least a pair of them escaped and began
the process of naturalization. It is of interest to note that both inter-
mediate coloration forms and the Golden-mantled forms turn up
again and again, though the latter is more rare. I have seen in an
avairy over a dozen of the splendidus forms gathered together, and they
certainly made a lovely picture. If, then, this is merely a local race, as
their presence in one Australian district suggests, then why is this form
found in the Waitakeres ? Is the explanation that a pair of the Golden-
mantled race also escaped from some avairy ? This is possible. On
the other hand, residents of the Waitekeres have informed me that not
only do these finer forms come from nests side by side with those of
the ordinary form, but also that out of the same nest they have taken
young birds of both the ordinary and the splendidus forms. Thus
doubts naturally arise as to the latter form being only a local Australian
race. It is possible, of course, that splendidus blood has been introduced
into our naturalized birds. It, however, seems more likely that these
finer forms are only and occasionally occurring variations of the
ordinary Platycercus eximius.
At the present time aviculture in New Zealand cannot be said to be
flourishing. This is perfectly natural in view of the claims the war has
made upon our attention. The contents of the bird shops show us
hosts of Canaries, Goldfinches, and Budgerigars, and not a few Green-
finches and Redpolls. A small number of Cockatiels are available and
plenty of Eastern Rosellas. But foreign birds are only rarely on sale
and then only from local aviaries. There have been no importations

for some time and one fears that the future shows little promise. It
would seem as if here we shall have as elsewhere to pay more attention
to the keeping of our own native birds. We are very proud of them
but our pride is mingled with sadness because many of them are
becoming rarer every year. Rats, cats, weasels, ferrets, stoats, even
dogs in the case of Kiwis, are taking a heavy toll. The declared policy
of Government Departments and some societies is admirable, the
preservation of our native birds, and many areas have rightly been
set aside as sanctuaries. Unfortunately, vermin get into some of these,
especially on the mainland. Nevertheless, the policy of the Government
Department is not faultless. While vermin continue to destroy our
birds in great numbers, and our rarer ones are in danger of becoming
more rare or even extinct, we are not permitted to keep and breed them
in our aviaries. Even Zoological Gardens are usually refused permis-
sion. Since the sanctuaries are well guarded--except for vermin--
and some of them are distant islands, it means that the average New
Zealander never sees many of the most interesting natives. I know
old people who have lived sixty years in the Dominion and have never
seen a Saddleback. Now there are here at least a few aviculturists
whom the Department should permit to have breeding pairs. I would
not ask such a favour for more than a very few and those experts who
love birds and know how to breed them. Unless this is done many of
our species of birds will become rarer and confined to a few island
sanctuaries which no one can visit except by seldom-given Department
permission or become extinct altogether. What has been done in
Australia by the handing over of rare birds to experts in breeding
them should be done here. In the meantime the refusal of permits
is rigidly enforced while vermin continue their deadly work on both
common and rare species. It is not sincere love of birds that influences
at least some of the strongest opponents of permits being granted to
even genuine and informed aviculturists, or they would not be so
ready with their guns when the seasons open for Wild Duck and
Pheasant killing.
This winter my garden has attracted the Tauhou (tystewps halma-
turina) in great numbers, far more than usual. Perhaps the very wet
season has had something to do with this. It is a most charming bird
in the aviary, where its low plaintive song interspersed with a lovely
warble is heard to advantage. I am inclined to think that in England
the food provided is usually too rich. We keep them here in perfect
health with a little ordinary food plus plenty of soft apple and such
insects as they themselves find in the aviary. I notice, too, that they are
very fond of the outside shells of the hulled oats after the other birds
have taken the kernels. The Tui (Prosthemadera novaseelandia) is
becoming more plentiful in the suburbs of Auckland City. Last month
I heard it for the first time in my own garden. It is good that so many

city residents are planting trees and shrubs which provide food and so
attract them. Not long ago I conducted a funeral service of a gentle-
man who loved birds. Not far from the graveside was a small tree.
A coincidence it probably was, but during the whole time from the
procession to the grave and the service thereat, a Tui poured forth a
most wonderful song. I have attended hundreds of funeral services,
but never did organ and choir touch the hearts of those present as did
the glorious music of that bird. " It may seem fanciful," said one there,
" but I could not help wondering if the bird was saying good-bye to
a friend or reminding us that where he had gone he would still hear
the melodies he had loved so much for so long."

During the past year or two we have become used to seeing Parrots
advertised for sale at, by pre-1939 standards, fancy prices. Roseate
Cockatoos at #20, Blue-fronted Amazons #25-^30, and Greys at
any amount up to #60. Needless to say these prices are not always
obtained. Some rather fancy prices were, however, recently paid by
an over-enthusiastic lady, new to aviculture and apparently determined
to procure birds at any price. Amongst her purchases from a " Pet
Shop " were a pair of Quaker Parrakeets for the exorbitant sum of
#30, a pair of Nyasa Lovebirds # 15, and a cock King Parrakeet,
with defective feet, #20. Birds are, we know, in very short supply,
but prices such as these are very definitely not justified.
Compared with present prices some of those of about a hundred
years ago make strange and interesting reading. In the Library of
the Zoological Society of London there is a unique priced Sale
Catalogue of the Menagerie and Aviary at Knowsley. On the death of
Lord Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby, the collection was dispersed.
Its extent may be gauged by the fact that the sale was extended
over six days, 6th to nth October, 1851. The total number of birds
was 1,272 of 318 species, of which 549 of 45 species were Knowsley-
bred. Among the larger purchasers were Prince Demidoff, Captain
Hornby for H.M. the Queen, Gurney, Jamrach, Castang, and the
London Zoo. Lack o c space prevents anything like a full list, but some
of the following are not without interest.
Eagles ; the highest priced was a Harpy at #25, followed by Martial
and Crowned at # 16 each. A White-tailed went for 26s. and a pair
of Golden #5 10 s.

BRIEF INTERLUDES WITH SAHARAN
STONE-CURLEWS

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999391025" page_id="56289103"  page_num="19" year="" vol="">
On the 29th April, 1945, it being our weekly " half-day ", my
friend Leslie Hall and I had left camp to pay our usual visit to a
gorge about four miles away in the desert (we were at that time in
a camp on the desert edge at Maadi, near Cairo), where a pair of
Brown Necked Ravens had their nest.
As we crossed the bed of a small wadi, where it opened out into
a flat area of low-lying desert much used for target practice and other
distasteful by-products of modern warfare, we suddenly saw a Saharan
Stone-Curlew running away in front of us, and at almost the same
instant noticed a second bird slinking up the opposite bank. Eagerly
we commenced to search for the nest, in our ignorance first examining
the vicinity of every little stunted desert shrub. When this proved
fruitless, we tried the old dodge of walking round in widening circles,
but this manoeuvre was rather handicapped by our being by this
time far from certain of the exact spot where the birds had first
appeared. After twenty minutes of vain searching, I was just about
to make some " face-saving " remarks about the birds probably
not having yet laid, when Les cried out " Here it is ! " and there at
his feet in the merest suggestion of a " scrape " among the sand and
stones, away from any of the near-by shrubs and boulders which might
have provided a little shade, lay two large stone-grey eggs, blotched
and speckled with black.
On the 6th of May I visited the nest again, but as I was en route
for the Ravens once more, I did not tarry after I had examined the
eggs and ascertained that as yet there was no sound of the chicks
within. Nevertheless, on my next visit on the 13th of May, I felt sure
the chicks would have hatched, and resolved to spend some time
watching the Stone Curlews even though it meant curtailing that
to be spent with my beloved Ravens. I accordingly approached
from the further side of the bank, so that I could overlook the little
valley where the eggs lay. As I appeared I saw one of the old birds
slinking head down away from the nest, but as I slowly sat down
and remained still, it stopped, standing absolutely immobile after the
manner of its kind. A peculiar loud cry arose from near the nest, and
at once evoked the warning note, a sort of low growling moan, from
another Stone Curlew which I now noticed crouched beneath a small
bush about half-way between me and the nest site.
The cry was repeated with the monotonous regularity characteristic
of the young of nidifugous birds when in distress ; on every occasion it
was answered by the warning note from the adult beneath the bush,

which, however, did not display any other signs of concern. After
about five minutes, the bird which had been brooding, turned very
slowly, and commenced to walk back to the nest. Its movements
were a study in slow motion ! Each forward step must have taken
nearly half a minute, and had I not kept my field glasses glued on
the bird, it would have hardly been possible to detect any movement.
When, however, it at last arrived above the nest, it rather spoiled
the effect of its previous caution by sitting down with jerky and
conspicuous suddenness.
The afternoon was particularly hot, and both Stone Curlews were
panting uncomfortably, their black tipped yellow bills gaping widely.
The unhappy calling of the chick continued, and the bird on the
nest shifted once or twice as though ill at ease, and finally rose and
walked about two yards to the spot whence the cries emanated,
squatted down, and brooded for a couple of minutes, then got up,
looked in a worried manner at some object at its feet, but returned
to the nest and brooded there again.
Unable to contain my curiosity any longer, I rose and walked
over to the nest. The nearer Stone Curlew at once ran off down the
wadi, and a moment later I saw the brooding bird (as I thought)
running up the opposite bank, but there had evidently been three
adults present, for when I reached the nest the parent flew off almost
into my face, giving me rather a start, and alighted about 20 yards
away.
In the nest was a chipping egg, and a couple of yards away a Stone
Curlew chick lay on its back, in the sun. I picked it up. The sand
and stones on which it lay were painfully hot to the touch. It was
too weak to stand, and lay in my hand, its head limp, its eyes covered
with particles of sand and gritty dust, its beak half open, all its
remaining energies seemingly taken up by the loud despairing cry
which it uttered mechanically without ceasing ; and now, without
reason, for it was too far gone apparently to pay any attention to the
anxious warning responses of its parents. How it came to be in such
a predicament I do not know, presumably it must have crawled from
the nest before it could walk, and somehow fallen on to its back, when
the fierce sun striking on its abdomen had done its deadly work.
I placed it beside the egg, hoping that it might recover when the
parent returned to shelter it. The latter was still where it had alighted,
calling anxiously and bobbing its head up and down in the usual
manner of charadriiformes birds when perturbed.
Suddenly there was a rush of torn air as a Lanner Falcon came
diving out of the sky. The Stone Curlew ducked and commenced
to run ; it had taken hardly three steps before the Falcon was on it,
but at the moment that I expected it to be struck down or carried
away, it spread its wings, tail, and every feather on its body, uttered

a loud startling cry, and appeared to strike up at its attacker with
its bill. Its sudden apparent metamorphism from a streaky brown
bird to one twice as large, vividly marked with black and white,
coupled with the sudden cry and aggressive movements, had to my
intense surprise an even more unnerving effect on the Lanner than
on myself, for she curved up into the sky and drifted away, leaving
her quarry unharmed. There was, I think, no question of the Falcon
having missed her stoop, as the Stone Curlew was right in the open,
and as anyone who has worked with Pigeons in the Egyptian desert
will know, it is unusual for a Lanner to give up after one, or even a
dozen, unsuccessful stoops if her quarry is still in the open.
Late in the evening, after I had interviewed the Ravens, I called
at the Stone Curlew's nest on my way back to camp. The air was
now cool with black clouds and heavy thunder further over the
desert threatening a storm of some severity. The brooding bird
flew off with a mournful cry and a flicker of pied wings in the gloom.
The younger chick had hatched and was already dry and looking
about it sturdily, but the elder lay dead beside it. A few hours later
the storm burst, and at io p.m. vast torrents of water came pouring
down from the desert, inundating our camp, sweeping away most of
my private possessions, including to my annoyance all my note-
books on birds seen in Libya, drowning scores of Sand Martins and
Little Green Bee-eaters as they roosted in their nesting burrows in
the banks of previously dry ditches and cuttings, and bringing untold
misery to most of the natives living in or near Maadi and Helwan.
As every semblance of a wadi in the adjacent desert had been, if
only for a few hours, the conduit for a raging torrent, I naturally
expected that the second chick would have been swept away to its
death, but on visiting the area a week later, I found the parents still
present (although the mysterious third bird had gone), and from
their behaviour I was convinced that the chick was alive and in the
vicinity, but a short search failed to reveal it, and not wishing to
keep it crouched for any length of time in the blazing sun, of whose
devastating effects on young Stone Curlews I had had such ample
evidence, I left the birds in peace with my best wishes.
Those who choose to consider birds as mere instinct-impelled
automata will no doubt revel in the apparent stupidity of the Stone
Curlew, that, confronted with a chick fallen on its back and dying
from the heat, it was unable to grasp the situation sufficiently to re-act
by turning the chick over. But others may reflect that, could any
superhuman being watch us for a little while, he might be equally
amazed at the number of times when we are quite unable to find a
way to aid or succour those we love, and consider that the Stone
Curlew did at least solve the problem of saving the second chick
from the inundation.

22 A. A. PRESTWICH-NESTING HABITS OF AGAPORNIS AND GORYLLIS
I am wondering whether any of your readers will be able to give
some information on a point which puzzles me ? The Senegal Stone
Curlew, which is the common species in the cultivated areas of the
Nile Delta, usually nests on the flat roofs of houses, where the young,
according to all the people who have had these birds nest on their
houses, of whom I was able to inquire, remain for about three weeks
or so after hatching. Do the parents carry up food for the young
during this period ? I always imagined that the young of Plover-like
birds foraged on their own account, but in February, 1943, I was
shown a small roof where these birds had nested for years (the old
pair were present at the time), and which certainly did not harbour
enough insect life to support the chicks for three days, much less
three weeks, so that circumstantial evidence would suggest that the
parents do bring food to their chicks, but I feel sure others beside
myself would welcome any definite information on the subject.

ON THE NESTING HABITS IN CAPTIVITY AND
FREEDOM OF AGAPORNIS AND GORYLLIS
By Arthur A. Prestwich
When, in 1869, Dr. Brehm stated that he had observed the Rosy-
faced Lovebirds ( Agapornis roseicollis) at the Berlin Aquarium carrying

strips of willow bark tucked amongst their rump feathers his statement
caused considerable surprise and was treated with a deal of scepticism.
It was not long, however, before his observation was confirmed in the
aviaries and bird-rooms of several aviculturists. Dr. Carl Russ and
Graf Yorck von Wartenburg made known similar discoveries con-
cerning the Madagascar Lovebird (A. cana) about 1872 (see Die
Gef. Welt., 1875, 46 ; 1890, 278 : Russ, Handbook , 1878, 254 : Die
Papage&apos;en, vol. iii, 416 (1881)). Next, Baroness Irma Mariassy {Die
Gef. Welt., 1890, 254,) recorded the same habit for the Red-faced
Lovebird {A. pullaria). This was not, however, confirmed until some
forty-five years later, when H. Hampe carried out a series of breeding
experiments {Orn. Mber., 1936, 42 ; A.M., 1937, 148 ; JfO., 1938,
I0 9)-
The next Lovebird to be introduced to aviculture was the Abyssinian
{A. taranta) in 1906, but it remained a rarity until 1925, after which it
was bred on numerous occasions both here and on the Continent.
In 1926 Dr. Walder {Die Gef. Welt., 1926, 97 ; 1927, 1) published the
fact that he had observed this species carrying pieces of leaves tucked
not only under the rump feathers, but also amongst the neck and

breast feathers. Hampe found that this mode of conveyance applied
also to the Madagascar and the Red-faced. Anton Suchomel [Die
Gef. Welt., 1929, 395) confirmed the rump-carrying.
It should be mentioned that experiences with the Abyssinian vary
to a remarkable extent. There are apparently three methods
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.852488888888889" page_id="56289107"  page_num="23" year="" vol="">
employed :--
(a) Nesting-material not used or carried. The female plucks
feathers from her breast and neck and makes use of them as a
nest lining.
(b) Nesting-material is used, preferably green leaves, and strips of
these are carried between the feathers of the rump, chest, and
neck.
(c) Nesting-material is used, mostly pieces of bark, conveyed in the
beak.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.977912419354839" page_id="56289107"  page_num="23" year="" vol="">
This diversity is possibly explained by the fact that there are two
races : A. t. taranta of North and East Abyssinia, and A. t. nana of " The
region of the middle and lower Omo and upper course of the
Sobatquell River, especially about Gelo 53 (Neumann, Jf.O ., 1931,
550). A. t. nana is entirely like the typical race except that it is con-
siderably shorter in the wings and smaller in the beak. Edward
Schutze writes at considerable length on A. taranta in Vogel Ferner
Lander, 1934, pp. 50-57, and according to him the larger race, which
occupies the plains, uses material and the smaller, a mountain dweller,
carries hardly any nest-material.
The Black-cheek (A. nigrigenis) was imported for the first time in
1908 and it was naturally supposed that it would exhibit the same
habits as its congeners ; but up to the present there does not seem
to be any record of its carrying nesting-material other than in the beak.
This also applies to the three other " eye-ring 33 Lovebirds--the
Nyasaland (A. Uliana), the Masked (A. pirsonata) and Fischer's {A.
fisc her i) . Concerning the last-named, however, Hampe (J.f.O.,
1938, 109) has written that he often saw one tame male try to stow
strips of bark amongst its rump feathers.
I do not propose to describe in detail the nesting habits in captivity
of Agapornis, as they are so well-known to aviculturists.
The genus Agapornis is not unique in having, for want of a better
name " rump-carriers 33 amongst its members. This distinction is
shared with Coryllis (olim Loriculus), at least four species of which are
known to do likewise. The available information is as follows :
Halmahera Hanging Parrot (C. amabilis ). The Duke of Bedford has
described an unsuccessful nesting attempt in A.M., 1931, 238, and
writes : "In July she started to carry grass into the box, tucking a
load into the feathers of her rump and flanks, after the fashion of a
Madagascar Lovebird. 33

of Bedford in the same volume, p. 299, describing the nesting of this
species says : " The hen soon began . . . collecting grass and carrying
it tucked into the feathers of her flanks and rump much after the
fashion of a Peach-faced Lovebird."
Blue-crowned Hanging Parrot (C. galgulus) . The Duke of Bedford
in his Parrots and Parrot-like Birds in Aviculture , p. 80, states : " The hen
is said to line her nest with grass, strips of leaves, and chips of wood
carried tucked into the feathers of the rump or upper breast."
Ceylon Hanging Parrot (C. beryllinus). Dr. Osman Hill, in lit.,
27th July, 1944, writes : " I have several times got them as far . as
laying eggs in an upturned drainpipe. They carry nesting material
beneath their upper tail coverts in the same way as the Agapornis
species."
It is indeed curious that some species of two genera so very dissimilar
in structure and habits as Agapornis and Coryllis should have adopted
the same method of carrying nesting-material.
Before proceeding further, perhaps it would be as well, for the
benefit of ornithologists generally and field-naturalists in particular,
to give a brief description of the modus operandi : for it must be remem-
bered that such knowledge as we have is entirely due to the
observations of aviculturists. With slight variations the general plan
is for the bird, almost invariably the female, to alight on a young
bough of a growing tree, preferably willow, poplar or ash, and to bite
off--by passing her beak along sideways, nipping away as she goes--
a strip of bark about three inches long. She then doubles it, by
giving a nip about one third of its length from one end so that the two
sides form an acute angle. She then tucks the piece, at the angle,
under one or more feathers of the lower back or upper tail-coverts,
leaving both ends sticking out. This operation is repeated until some
six or eight pieces have been hooked on ; the number varies according
to the time occupied in obtaining the bark. She then flies off to the
nest, releases her load by shaking and returns for a further supply.
Some pieces fall to the ground and in these no further interest is taken.
In an aviary, if suitable supplies of bark are not available, the perches
and woodwork of the aviary will be utilized. Lovebirds, the whole
genus not merely the " rump-carriers ", are extraordinarily adaptable
where nesting-material is concerned, and nothing seems to come amiss.
One occasionally reads of Lovebirds so loaded as to resemble
" miniature haystacks ", but this is only descriptive licence.
In J.f.O ., 1938, pp. 113-122, there is a paper reprinted from the
Ornithological Section of the Zoological Museum of Berlin, titled
" On the Structure of the Small Feathers of Agapornis ", by Llelmut
Sick. In this paper Sick examines microscopically the rump feathers
of various species of Agapornis and shows that each feather has small,
loose hooks hanging along its edges, visible on the ventral aspect.

A. A. PRESTWICK NESTING HABITS OF AGAPORNIS AND GORYLLIS 2 5
He gives an intricate description of a dense system of hanging " tooth-
combs " intimately engaging its neighbouring feather. Of the species
examined A. cana would appear the most fully developed in these
specialized characters. Towards the end of his study Sick introduces
us to a new word, that of " Transportgefieder ", which may be
rendered into English as " Conveyance-feathers ". It is this develop-
ment of brush structure in the feathers, principally of back, rump,
hind neck, and breast, which enables Agapornis species to perform such
a remarkable process in the conveyance of nesting-material. Whether
the " eye-ring " Lovebirds and Coryllis species have this same
specialized development is not ascertainable at present. We now
come to the apparent reason for the adoption of this method of carrying
material. The usual explanation is that the Order Psittaciformes, with
very few exceptions, select a hole in a decaying tree trunk or branch
in which to rear their young. The great majority make no attempt at a
nest, but merely lay their eggs on the bare, decaying wood. The
genera under review, however, to a vary ing extent line their nesting-
sites with fine strips of bark, leaves, etc. The site selected is often very
inaccessible, and they are unable to fly straight to the entrance of their
nesting-places as a Tit or a Starling usually can, but have to fly on to
the side of the location and then climb up, possibly only a few inches,
lift themselves into the opening by means of their beaks, and then creep
in. A Parrot when climbing uses its beak almost as much as its feet,
a sort of third hand, and if they relied on their beaks for carrying
material they would find the task very laborious, most of the material
necessarily falling to the ground during the process. Well, that's the
usual explanation, and I must confess I cannot find much fault with it,
or think of a better.
One would imagine the sites chosen by the " eye-ring " quartet
to be just as inaccessible as those of their congeners, and judging by their
behaviour in captivity they do not carry material other than in their
beaks. Unfortunately, but little information is available concerning
nesting in the wild state, field-naturalists and collectors are very
meagre in their data in connection with this very important matter.
It cannot be through lack of observation on the part of the former, so
we must conclude that in the majority of cases they don't happen to be
in the locality during the breeding season. The following is the more
important of the available matter.
A. roseicollis. Whenever the nesting of this species is mentioned,
authors invariably quote Andersson {Notes on the Birds of Damara Land,
p. 216) : " This bird does not make any nest of its own, but takes
possession of nests belonging to other birds, especially Philetarus
socius 1 and Plocepasser mahali. 2 I cannot say whether it forcibly ejects

the rightful owners of these nests, or merely occupies such as they have
abandoned ; but in the case of the first named species, I have seen
Parrots and the Grosbeaks incubating in about equal numbers under
the shelter of the same friendly roof. The egg is pure white, not
unlike a Woodpecker's, but more elongated."
Andersson's Notes were published after his death, by J. H. Gurney
in 1872. They bear an extraordinarily close resemblance to James
Chapman's Travels in the Interior of South Africa (vol. ii, p. 406, appendix)
published in 1868 : " Does not make a nest of their own, but takes
possession of nests belonging to other birds, such as Loxia socia }
Plocapasser mahili , etc. ; but whether they forcibly eject the original
owners, or merely make use of voluntarily abandoned nests, I cannot
say. But be this as it may, they are found incubating side by side of the
strangers. Lays a number of white eggs, not unlike those of Wood-
peckers." Some fifty years before the publication of the Chapman and
Andersson notes, Vieillot, who first described the species in Nouveau
Dictionnaire d'Histoire Naturelle , vol. xxv, p. 377 (1817), had written :
" Cette espece habite en Afrique les parties interieures du Cap de
Bonne-Esperance, y vit en societe, et chasse souvent de leurs nids les
gros-becs sociaux ou republicans , pour y deposer ses oeufs."
Later writers, Layard [The Birds of South Africa , New edition by
R. Bowdler Sharpe, p. 192) (1875-84), Stark and Sclater (The Birds
of South Africa , vol. iii, p. 231) (1903), and Cecil D. Priest (Birds of
Southern Rhodesia , vol. ii, p. 294) (1934) all content themselves with
merely quoting Andersson's account. Dr. Ed. Fleck, in a paper
titled " Bird Life of German South-West Africa " (JfO. } 1894,
p. 395) writes : " At the end of January I found that a pair had a
brood in a rocky cleft." And finally, Dr. Austin Roberts (The Birds
of South Africa , p. 134) (1940) says : " Usually very plentiful and sociable,
nesting in the community nests of the Sociable Weaver (Philetairus
socius) from which the owners are turned out, or in crevices of rocks."
It seems extraordinary that so little should have been recorded by
recent field-naturalists and collectors. One cannot help wondering
whether Chapman and Andersson really actually saw the com-
munity nesting or whether perhaps they had Vieillot's statement in
mind. If community nesting really does take place, it would probably
be in areas where trees providing suitable nesting sites were scarce.
Andersson's contention that the Rosy-faced makes no nest of its own
cannot be accepted by the many aviculturists who have had experience
in breeding this species.
A. pullaria. Here we are on much firmer ground. It seems definite
that this species uses the nests of tree ants. G. L. Bates, in " Birds of
Southern Cameroon " (Ibis, 1911, 496) writes : " (A hen) was shot
by my boy as it came out of a hole in an ants' nest (njak) high up in
an aseng tree, near the village. I went to see the place, and the boy

climbed up and begun [sic] to chop the njak, which was hard and
earthy and firmly attached to the large tree-stem--a different kind of
njak from the one in which a Woodpecker's nest was found (cf.
Ibis, 1909, p. 20). The big ants inhabiting the njak bit him so cruelly
that he had to come down. The tree was then chopped down ; but
the hole in the njak was found empty. I suppose the hole had been
excavated by these birds ; the mate of the one killed was seen in the
tree-tops near by. How do they endure the ants ? They must work so
gently that the ants are not disturbed. These fierce ants would be an
excellent defence for the birds against robbers of their nest." And in
his Handbook of the Birds of West Africa, p. 177 (1930), Bates says :
" A pullaria said to have been taken from a hole in a tree is presumptive
evidence of a breeding-place. But I have still better evidence of a
different sort of breeding-hole, by having twice found a pair . . .
excavating a hollow in a large, globular, hanging, earthy ants' nest
in a tree. In one of these nests the ants (a large, biting kind) were still
in possession, and bit the boy who went to chop out the bird's hole so
furiously that he had to desist : yet they did not seem to have molested
the birds, which probably went and came so gently as not to disturb
them." Major W. R. Thompson, " Field Notes on the Birds of Sierra
Leone " ( Ibis , 1925, 66) writes : " Major Scovil tells me that he has
found this bird breeding in a Woodpecker-like hole scooped out from
the side of the mud nest of a species of termite which builds in trees.
I do not know if this is a usual situation, but I have reason to believe
it is, as I have often seen these holes myself."
D. A. Bannerman ( The Birds of Tropical West Africa, vol. ii, p. 410)
(1931), does not add to our knowledge, merely quoting Bates,
Thompson, and Scovil. James P. Chapin, " The Birds of the Belgian
Congo," part ii, p. 242 (Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., Ixxv, 1939), writes :
" Five young of a single brood were brought to us in October at
Faradje, taken, it was said, from a hole in a large termite hill on the
ground." Concerning the nesting of the Uganda race of pullaria
(A. p. Uganda;) Sir Frederick Jackson (The Birds of Kenya Colony and the
Uganda Protectorate, vol. i, p. 541 (1938) writes : "Almost invariably
selects the large black or reddish-brown and abandoned nest of a
tree-ant as a site. These curious nesting sites are a common feature in
Uganda forests, and may be attached to the trunk or bough of a tall
tree, and from about about six to forty or more feet from the ground.
Into these the bird either itself, or more probably a Woodpecker,
bores a tunnel from ten to twenty inches in depth, and with an
enlarged chamber at the end. Several such nests have been found
containing young birds, but unfortunately none with eggs."
There is a very interesting paper, " The Nesting of African Birds in
Association with other Living Things," by R. E. Moreau in Ibis, 1942.
On p. 240, he observes that on present evidence this Lovebird is

entirely dependent on tree-ants and/or tree-termites for their nesting
sites and " The termites do not apparently molest either the sitting
bird or the young, which would, presumably, be highly vulnerable to
bites".
A. cana. Almost nothing seems to have been recorded on their
breeding in the wild state. M. Paul Garie ( Bull. de la Soc. Nat. d&apos;Acclim.
de France , September, 1916) says the nest is built in the hollow of a
dead tree. And Dr. Russ ( Die Papageien, vol. iii, p. 416) (1881) can do
no better than to quote Pollen that they nest in high trees.
A. taranta. We are not much better off with this species. W. T.
Blanford ( Observations on the Geology and Z 00 ^*Sy *f Abyssinia , p. 305)
(1870) writes : " My collector obtained in April an egg, which he
assured me belonged to this bird, from a hole in a tree, and there can
be little doubt of its having been correctly identified." G. F. von
Erlanger ( JfO ., 1905, 438) states : " Hilgert observed them only
once with certainty in a roundish hole in a high tree-trunk. He
certainly killed the birds, but was unable to reach them in their hole,
which was much restricted in size."
Herbert Friedmann, " Birds Collected by the Childs Frick Expedi-
tion to Ethiopia and Kenya Colony," part i, p. 294 (U.S. Nat. Mus.
Bull., 153) (1930), says that a series of fifteen specimens were collected
but, nevertheless, he is unable to give any information regarding
breeding other than to quote Blanford. The Duke of Bedford (A.M.,
1926, 193) writes : " A relative of mine, who has lived for some time
in Abyssinia, told me that the Abyssinian Lovebird appeared to be
breeding in the nests of another species of Weaver." I have not been
able to find confirmation of this. ;
Concerning the " eye-ring " group, very little has been recorded.
A. Loveridge, " Notes on East African Birds collected 1915-19 "
(P.Z.S., 1922, ii, p. 854), writes of A. personata : " They were nesting
in the holes of a baobab-tree, whose apertures they had apparently
partly closed with a defence of thorns " (see also P.^. 5 *., 1923, ii, p. 911,
where Loveridge says four eggs were taken from such a location).
Sir Frederick Jackson ( The Birds of K.C. and the U.P., vol. i, p. 542)
refers to Loveridge's observation. And regarding A. nigrigenis, Cecil
Priest ( The Birds of Southern Rhodesia , vol. ii, p. 296) says : " Nests in
hollow trees, laying three to four white eggs."
I have been unable to find out very much regarding the nesting of
Hanging Parrots, other than the Vernal and Blue-crowned.
C. vernalis. A. O. Hume ( The Nests and Eggs of Indian Birds , 2nd
Edition, vol. iii, p. 92) (1890) quotes several accounts : " Mr. Davison
says : 4 On the 19th April, while returning to Ross from Port
Mouat, a Burman convict, who was with me, saw a bird of this species
fly into a hole in the branch of a forest tree growing by the road-
side. He called my attention to this, and I sent him up the tree. On

his climbing up he found the bird (which he caught and brought down
with him) sitting on three round, white eggs. The hole was about
20 feet from the ground, and contained no lining or attempt at a nest,
the eggs being laid on some soft, black, earthy-looking powder that
lay at the bottom of the hole, and which had evidently fallen from the
top and sides of the hole. The hole, which was a natural one, not
excavated by the bird, was moderately large, but not quite large
enough to admit the convict's hand without a little cutting away at
its lower edge.' "
Hume continues : 44 Mr. T. W. Bourdillon writes from
Travancore : 4 Last Monday (15th March) ... I saw a Loriquet
(L. vernalis) fly out of a hole in a stump. The stump was about 15 feet
high, and was hollowed out for about the depth of a foot ; this hollow
was protected by a thick jungle creeper, under which the bird found
room to pass in and out. Investigation showed that the nest was
composed of a very few dry leaves at the bottom of the cavity, and
that it contained three very hard-set, glossy, white eggs. This nest was
at an elevation of about 2,000 feet above sea-level, in a new clearing
near the edge of some heavy jungle.' "
And later Hume says : " Major G. T. Bingham found the nest of
this species in Tenasserim. He writes : 4 This bird is very common
in the Thoungyeen valley. On the 24th February, 1880, a nest-hole
of this pretty little Loriquet was pointed out to me by a Karen, in the
branch of a large silk-cotton tree {Bombax). ... It was on the side of
the branch at a height of about 40 feet from the ground. . . . The hole
was about 1J in. in diameter, and about 6 or 7 inches deep, going in
obliquely inwards towards the base of the branch. It was unlined
except for a few fragments of chipped wood.' "
H. G. Robinson ( The Birds of the Malay Peninsula , vol. i, p. 88) (1923)
only quotes the Bingham account.
C. galgulus . F. N. Ghasen {The B. of the M.P. , vol. iv, p. 71) (1939)
gives quite a complete account : 44 In Lower Perak, according to
Mr. A. T. Edgar, this bird nests in holes high up in dead nibong
palms, or in living trees standing in open jungle. He describes one
nest, forty feet from the ground, in a tall living tree as follows : 4 The
entrance of the nest was about three inches in diameter, but inside the
tree the hole was about eighteen inches deep and twelve inches across.
The bird had filled up this large cavity, to about six inches below the
entrance hole, with a pile of fronds of bracken and green leaves, torn
up into pieces roughly an inch square. The leaves at the bottom of the
filling were partly dry, but those on top were still green. The three
white eggs were much stained and had a tough shell. . . . The clutch
may also be four, as one of the nibong nests had four nestlings. In this
nibong nest the hole was much smaller and the lining was wood-
shavings only.' "

H. C. Robinson (loc. cit, p. 87) says : " The nesting habits are
almost certainly exactly similar to those of L. vernalis ."
C. beryllinus. F. Lewis {Ibis, 1898, 346) writes : " It breeds in high
trees, but I have never succeeded in procuring the eggs." W. E. Wait
(Manual of the Birds of Ceylon , p. 241) (1925) is rather more explicit and
records : " For its nest it chooses a small, natural cavity in a tree,
excavating the interior to a depth of 2 to 4 feet. The clutch consists
of two or three eggs, laid on a pad of green leaves spread about an
inch thick at the bottom of the hole."
The foregoing extracts comprise practically all that has been written
on the nesting habits in the wild state of Agapornis and Coryllis : some
are perhaps overlong, and there is some repetition, this is due to the
desire to show how much, or how little, has been recorded on the
various species.
In the past too little credit has been given to aviculturists
for their discoveries. Some ornithologists are only too willing
to recognize the value of their work and welcome their observa-
tions as a complement of their own. On the other hand, there are some
only too anxious to belittle their efforts, claiming that the behaviour of
birds in captivity bears little resemblance to their behaviour in a
state of freedom. Such was undoubtedly true to a certain extent in the
days of crowded quarters and " bird-chambers ". But they are things
of the past, and the majority of present-day aviculturists keep their
birds in aviaries under conditions closely approximating a natural
state. It can be claimed with justification that but for the aviculturist
little, if anything, would be known regarding the habits of very many
species--not merely those we have had under review--but the majority
of the near 900 species that have so far been successfully bred in
confinement.

In the last Waterfowl number of this Magazine a scheme was
put forward for making a census of the Ducks, Geese, and Swans
which are still being kept on ornamental waters in this country.
Besides the appeal in the Magazine some letters were sent out asking
for the co-operation of those who kept waterfowl in pre-war days.
We have received a most excellent response to this appeal and the
results give us a very fair idea of the numbers of waterfowl which
have survived the war years. Although we recognize that we have
probably failed to discover all the birds which are being kept, yet we
feel that we now have a record of at least 90 per cent of them. The
time seems to have come, therefore, to make a summary of the results
for the benefit of all members of the Society.

It will be remembered that one of the principal objects of the scheme
was to facilitate exchanges and adjustments so as to pair up as many
odd birds as possible and prevent species of which only a few are
left from dying out in this country altogether. Already we have
organized the exchange of fifty-one such birds amongst nineteen
aviculturalists, and we are only waiting to hear that this preliminary
experiment has been successfully completed before suggesting a
further series of exchanges.
As may be imagined, the mechanism of such a plan is extremely
complicated. Each aviculturalist who has agreed to co-operate in the
scheme, and who has odd birds which should be paired, receives a
letter saying, 44 If you will be good enough to send a Red Crested
Pochard drake to so-and-so and a female Chilean Teal to so-and-so,
you will receive a drake Mandarin from someone else and a female
Bahama Pintail from someone else again. 35 Such a transaction
involves five aviculturalists, and should any stage of it go wrong the
whole balance is thrown out. So far, however, all those who have
agreed to co-operate have been most helpful, and the exchanges have
gone forward without a serious hitch.
So far we have attempted to arrange exchanges of birds of approxi-
mately the same value. But in view of what we have discovered from
the Waterfowl Registry, the values of particular species must now be
considered very different from their pre-war values. Many which
were formerly common on ornamental ponds throughout the country
are now represented by only three or four individuals. For future
exchanges, therefore, it seems desirable that an approximate exchange
value should be attached to all species. With this object in view, a
number of aviculturalists have been consulted and have agreed that
the values shown against each species in the following list are more or
less correctly related to the rarity, hardiness, breeding propensities, and
decorativeness of that particular species.
It must be understood that the numbers of birds in the list represent
the minimum, since it is possible that there may be others of which we
have not heard.
The following waterfowl are known to be living in captivity or at
semi-liberty in the British Isles. Including Zoos and other Institutions,
they are divided amongst 49 separate collections :--

The Chairman said that the date of the meeting was apparently
a little unlucky as regards a chairman. The Club's Chairman, Mr.
D. Seth-Smith, was unavoidably prevented from being present ; the
Deputy-Chairman, Miss Barclay-Smith, was in Belgium at an
ornithological conference, and Dr. Amsler was also away. Con-
sequently the duty devolved on her.
Dealing with the evening's programme, the Chairman said that at
the last meeting the members had had the pleasure of welcoming
Capt. Delacour. The films he had intended showing on that occasion
were unfortunately delayed in transit. At the present meeting the
films were there but Capt. Delacour was not present to show them,
as he was due to return to America that afternoon. Mr. Seth-Smith
had hoped to show them, in his absence Col. Tenison had kindly
consented to deputize. In addition, Col. Tenison was showing a film
of hybrid Macaws at present in the Edinburgh Zoo.
The first film was an American educational film on bird migration,
entitled " High over the Borders ". It was of the sound variety, but this

feature detracted rather than added to the interest as the American
commentator was almost unintelligible. The films that followed were
of more interest to aviculturists. To complement " The Display of the
Umbrella Bird ", in colour, Col. Tenison gave a summary of a very
interesting paper by Capt. Delacour, translated from UOiseau.
Summary of article " L'Oiseau-parasol ", byj. Delacour, LOiseau ,
Paris, 1945, pp. 130-140, 4 pis.
The Umbrella-bird belongs to the family of Cotingidae, that family
of South American birds which includes so many strange forms, such
as the Cock of the Rock. The well-known collector, M. Chas. Cordier,
made valuable records on their behaviour and has now brought
specimens to the New York Zoo. The Umbrella Bird is a large black
bird, the size of a crow. The male, distinguished by its large crest,
is considerably larger than the female. It inhabits both sides of the
Andes up to 4,000 feet elevation. The species Cephalopterus ornatus
has two distinct races. The southern race C. 0. penduliger is characterized
by its enormous pendulous neck ornament. The northern race, here
referred to C. 0. glabricollis , has a bare red throat and a shorter
pendulous neck ornament. Cordier sought it in Costa Rica in 1942
where he had heard it was very rare. He found that it was locally
called " Pavoncillo "--the little Peacock, or simply " Cuervos " or
" Corbeaux "--Crows. A farmer told him that they were formally
common and he had brought up his family on their flesh. He said
that the birds fed on locusts which they beat to death on the branches,
but Cordier could not confirm that. Cordier found them very wily,
generally frequenting the tops of tall trees where they slept, greeting
the dawn w T ith loud cries. Most of the day, however, they spent on
lower branches, making frequent expeditions to secure heavy feasts
of fruit from the neighbouring fruiting trees. Four or five males would
inhabit a single tree, but were jealous of their own territory of three
or four branches. They frequently held " crowing matches ". The
call is obtained by extending the neck pouch with air to the size of
a tomato and expelling it with a booming noise. After many un-
successful attempts, Cordier attempting catching them by stretching
gummed (? bird-lime) strings between their favourite perching
branches, he eventually caught two males and one female.
On arrival at the New York Zoo it was found that they needed
a very large cage or they injured themselves. The male started to
display in the spring of 1943 ; two different forms of display were
observed. One by distending the neck pouch as if to " crow ", but
deflating it without the booming call, the other by rocking the body
from side to side to make the neck ornament swing.
At the conclusion of the film Col. Tenison observed :--
The film brought out these points and adds considerably to the
knowledge of the habits of this rare and extraordinary bird, and the

Club is deeply indebted to Mr. Jean Delacour for his kindness in
bringing it to England and letting them see it.
The third film, " The Jewel Room," showed views in colour of the
" animated living pictures " in the bird house of the New York Zoo,
described by Capt. Delacour in the Avicultural Magazine, 1946,
p. 123. This was followed by an excellent record in colour of the
Wattled Crane, showing a young Bugeranus carunculatus with its parents
at various stages of growth from ten days to ten weeks. It had been
bred at the New York Zoo, the first and, so far, only one to be bred
in captivity. The programme closed with a film made by Mr. T. H.
Gillespie, the Director-Secretary of the Edinburgh Zoological Park.
The colouring was particularly good and the first part of the film
showed the two young Blue-and-yellow Macaws bred in the Park in
1939. The parents did not attempt to breed again until the present
year when they nested and eventually hatched one young one. It did
not, however, survive long. The second part depicted a hybrid
Red-and-blue X Blue-and-yellow Macaw, one of three at present in
the Park. They were bred three or four years ago by the late Kenneth
M'Douall, of Logan. The parents nested again in the Park this year
but the eggs were thrown out of the nest, possibly through some
squabbling with the other Macaws in the aviary, and were broken.
They nested on the floor of the indoor house, and not in a hollow
log, as one would expect.
The Chairman read a farewell greeting from Capt. Delacour,
sent on his departure that afternoon for America.
The meeting finally dispersed at 10 p.m.

NOTES
Sale of Audubon's " The Birds of America
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.9952776" page_id="56289120"  page_num="36" year="" vol="">
Many aviculturists are interested in ornithological books, and some, noticing in the
daily press that Mr. C. W. Traylen, the well-known book-seller of Guildford, has paid
the record price of #2,700 for a set of Audubon's The Birds of America , may have
wondered what manner of work could fetch such a sum. John James Audubon
(1781-1851) was probably the greatest of American naturalists and one of the
greatest of all bird painters. He scorned to paint stuffed birds, and for the greater
part of his life he journeyed through America painting birds in their natural state.
The original edition of The Birds of America was published by Audubon in London
during the years 1827-^1838. There were 435 plates in all, issued in 87 parts of five
plates each. They were published at two guineas the part, or #182 14^. the set.

Each plate, double elephant folio, reproduced an original water-colour painting by
the naturalist, and was a hand-coloured impression from a copper plate. They are
generally found in four volumes ; and it is believed that fewer than 200 complete
sets were bound up.
The set sold at Sotheby's on 17th December, 1946, was catalogued as the property
of a learned society.

The National Cage Bird Show.
The National Exhibition of Cage Birds, which was visited by H.R.H. Princess
Elizabeth, was held at the Royal Horticultural Hall on 5th, 6th, and 7th December,
1946. It was organized by Cage Birds for the benefit of the Soldiers', Sailors' and
Airmen's Help Society. The Foreign Section, which attracted sixty entries, was
judged by Tom Goodwin.

Bird Silver Trophy were awarded to B. H. Dulanty for his very perfect Loo-Choo
or Temminck's Robin (Icoturus komadori ), until lately one of two owned by Wallace
Wood. Other members of the Society were well to the fore and won a large propor-
tion of the awards.
H. Douthwaite benched a grand team and won first prizes with his Timor Island
Crimson-winged Parrakeet (best bird in Parrot classes), Many-coloured Parrakeets,
Saffron Finch, Red-headed and Black-headed Gouldian Finches (first and second),

Blue-winged X Turquoisine Parrakeets ; also second and third with pairs of Zebra
Finches and Bengalese and second with lutino Ring-neck Parrakeets.
P. A. Birch was first with a pair of Goffin's Cockatoos. T. Crewes had matters
much his own way in the rarer seed-eater class, his birds filling six of the first seven
places. The leaders were a perfect pair of Red-headed Parrot Finches, followed by
a Blood Finch, Banded Finches, Pectoral Finches, Long-tailed Grassfinches and
Chestnut-breasted Finches--the only real challenge came from G. Allerston's
Ruficaudas, placed second. He also gained third and fourth prizes with pairs of
Silver and White Zebra Finches.
O. E. Dunmore was first and second with a Jay Thrush, probably Fook's Laughing,
and a Purple-headed Starling.
Other first prizewinners were C. Laidman, Peach-faced Lovebirds ; Mrs.
M. C. Frayne, Stanley Parrakeets ; G. C. Lynch, Donaldson's Touracou, with his
Satin Bower Bird second ; and G. Allerston, Zebra Finches.
Mention must be made of W. T. Dring's Crimson-wings, 1945-bred (second),
C. Laidman's Plum-head Parrakeet (third), E. F. Benjamin's Derbyan Parrakeet
(second) and Red-collared Lorikeeets shown by W. V. Jenner (third) and W. A.

Additions to the London Zoo.
September--There were no arrivals of any great importance. Among the more
interesting were an Osprey ( Pandion haliatus) caught in the Thames Estuary, a
Manx Shearwater (Puffinus puffinus) and two Little Masked Weavers ( Sitagra
luteola ). At Whipsnade, six Brush Turkeys ( Alectura lathami ) and fifty-eight North
American Turkeys ( Meleagris gallopavo) were hatched.
October--Three very important collections arrived during the month. C. S.
Webb returned from Kenya on 18th October, bringing 78 birds; included were
5 species and 2 subspecies new to the Society's Collection. On 30th October, 111
birds arrived from the Gold Coast ; collected by G. S. Cansdale, they included no
less than 17 species and 3 subspecies new to the Collection. In addition there were
42 birds from the Gold Coast, presented by Sir Alan Burns, and these included 3
species and 2 subspecies new to the Collection.

THE AFRICAN GREY PARROT

<bodyText confidence="0.997517766666667" page_id="56289131"  page_num="39" year="" vol="">
So much has already been written about the well-known and justly
esteemed African Grey that it is not easy, at this late date, to find
anything new to say on the subject.
My excuses for writing this article must therefore be firstly that the
Editor asked me for a short note to accompany my coloured plate,
and secondly that I think I can claim to be the first person to have
bred the species in confinement in this country. Of their actual
breeding I will say no more here, as I wrote a full account of it which
appeared in a previous number of the Magazine.
Grey Parrots must surely have been the first of all exotic cage birds
to have reached these shores alive. There is, I believe, a quite well
authenticated record of one which belonged to King Henry VIII,
and was probably imported into this country some time in the first
half of the sixteenth century--quite 400 years ago ! They also appear
to have been much esteemed as pets by ladies of quality in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, sometimes having their place
in family portraits of the time, and undoubtedly the most famous of
all historical Grey Parrots was the one which belonged to the glamorous
Frances, Duchess of Richmond, who afterwards became a mistress
of Charles II. This favoured bird not only spent its life as its owner's
constant companion, but itself dying shortly after her death, was
stuffed and shared her dusty immortality as an effigy in Westminster
Abbey, where I seem to remember being taken to see it as a child.
The sexing of Greys remains a problem, and a notion has become
current that the male is always the " larger bolder looking bird " of
the two. Bolder looking, perhaps, in so far as he usually has rounder
more wide open eyes, as well as a rather more massive and flatter
skull, but I do not think the actual size of the bird has anything to
do with it. The species, after all, has a fairly wide range in its native
Africa, and I am inclined to think the various local races differ

considerably in size. Thus a cock of one local race might very well
be smaller than a hen of another, and vice versa.
As to intelligence, I have always considered that Grey Parrots
are supreme among birds, and quite as clever--not to say wily and
cunning--as the most intelligent dog that ever lived. They seem to
have, to a certain extent, a power of reasoning and planning, and
their time sense is remarkably accurate. Their memory is excellent,
and a Grey kept in a household which includes several dogs, will
never call one by its wrong name. One belonging to a friend of mine,
and possessing a marvellous vocabulary, had only to see you touch
your handkerchief--not necessarily take it out of your pocket--to
reproduce instantly an almost unnecessarily accurate human nose-
blowing !
It has often been said that Amazons are more treacherous than
Greys, but this strikes me as both unfair to Amazons and untrue of
Greys. Many examples of both species are, of course, never guilty of
treachery to their human friends, but whereas an Amazon intent on
biting you makes no bones about it, a Grey will do all in its power
to lull you first into a false sense of security.
Grey Parrots really take to cage life better than any bird I know,
and if frequently let out and taken notice of, are perfectly happy.
To anyone lucky enough to possess a true pair of these birds, and
who wants to try and breed from them, I would say that a really large
aviary is quite unnecessary. Some Greys, it is true, make use of flying
space ; the one bred here does, and one of the numerous specimens
we had at Keston before the war used to buzz about his aviary quite
like a Budgerigar. His wife, on the other hand, behaved more
typically, making about as much use of the aviary space as a chameleon
would, and climbing about it in the same slow reptilian fashion.

At last after many heartburnings we have succeeded in breeding
and rearing this beautiful Ruby Lory. What a joy it was finally to
behold the colourful addition in the aviary after so many disappoint-

a thrill and feel compensated for the care and attention bestowed in
carrying out this prolonged experiment.
I have to thank our esteemed friend Mr. Eastham Guild, who so
kindly made available to Taronga Park these glorious birds. We
received from him five specimens on 29th April, 1940. They were
the first to be seen at these Gardens and we were naturally elated to
be able to add them to our collection of Lories.
As far as we could judge they consisted of an adult pair and three
younger birds. Unfortunately one of the latter died soon after arrival.
The remaining four were placed together in an aviary having plenty
of flight space to acclimatize them in their new country. During the
1942-3 season two nesting logs were erected in the aviary and the
older pair nested in November, 1942, and later in February, 1943,
and on each occasion two eggs were laid. The first two were clear
and one of the second lot was fertile, but complete incubation did
not result.
The following year, 1943, the birds were separated and a pair
placed in two aviaries. The older pair nested once more in November,
laying again two eggs, but again we were disappointed, as one egg
was broken and a hatched dead chick was found on the ground
under the nest.
In January, 1944, the older pair again laid, the result this time
being two dead chicks newly hatched.
We tried unsuccessfully to procure some giant bamboo, so had to
again utilize hollow logs. In 1944, again in October, and in 1945 in
January, we had the same results, two dead chicks immediately after
hatching. This was indeed exasperating. Whether the birds are
clumsy or sit too heavily on the nest is a quandary, nevertheless we
were determined to still carry on and disturb them as little as possible.
In 1946 the birds once more nested in February, and on looking
in the log on 3rd April a baby was seen, which appeared to be two
to three weeks old, with just a touch of colour, red and green, showing
on the pin feathers.
On 8th April the chick was progressing well with more colour
showing up, but we did not see the parents going into the nest.
However, on 10th and nth April, both adults were in the nesting log.
As very bad weather now supervened we were afraid to make
further inspections until 20th April, when the young one appeared
almost clothed and looked well. The nest also was fairly clean.
On 26th April the log was found to be damp and dirty and the
young one not standing too well on its feet, so a clean nesting log
was substituted for the old one. The baby's feet and legs were very
dirty and we washed them in warm water before placing it in the
new log. When this was done and as soon as Mr. Murphy, the head
bird-keeper, came out of the aviary, both parents hurried in also.

42 R. A. PATTEN-OBSERVATIONS ON KUHL's RUFFED LORY
During the next few days it was noticed that the young one was
not using its feet too well, and that its claws were inclined to bunch up.
On the morning of 29th April the baby was out of the log and on
the ground. It was placed back in the nest and remained there for
the rest of the day.
On 30th April it was again on the ground and running around,
but seemed much stronger. It flew about 8 feet in the afternoon,
although only skimming just above the floor of the flight.
On 1 st May it was also observed running around in the shelter
during the morning, so we decided to place another log on the floor
as well. It took cover in this and for some time we used to place it
in the upper nest just before nightfall, as we thought the parents
might not go into the one on the ground.
On 16th May it appeared to be getting stronger, but not until
1 st June did we actually see the baby feeding itself; during the
afternoon we noticed that both the parents flew to the nest and called
the young one out and down to the food, where it drank some of
the nectar mixture and later on it entered the lower log and one of
the older birds also entered. From then onward the young one
appeared to develop rapidly.
The nesting log provided was placed in a horizontal position,
being in the flight but protected from the rain by an overhang from
the roof of the shelter ; the log was 2 feet long with a hollow of
6-7 inches in diameter. Some decomposed wood and bark found
generally in dry hollow spouts was utilized for nesting material.
The exact incubation period was not definitely ascertained, as we
were afraid on this occasion to make more than a limited number of
inspections owing to the birds previously losing their young after
hatching. However, during incubation, if anyone entered the aviary
the cock and hen would come into the flight and stop there until all
was quiet, then they would both enter and stop in the nesting log, so
it appeared that both shared in feeding and caring for their off-
spring.
The young bird did not leave the nest and fly into the flight for
seven weeks after hatching.
The immature bird has much duller colouring than the adult, also
the bill and legs are of a dark slaty appearance and the iris dark to
almost black.
The food used was a nectar mixture consisting of fresh cow's milk,
Mellin's Food, brown sugar with a little tomato juice added. During
the rearing period the food was supplemented with Penta Mulsion,
a concentrated mixture consisting of added vitamins, cod liver oil,
and orange juice.
The fruit supplied was apple, banana, paw paw, pear, and grapes.
We have found the Ruby Lories most attractive and beautiful

birds. Their gorgeous colouring is a delight and their playful habits,
particularly when rolling over on the ground, reminds one of kittens
rollicking in the sunshine.
I feel sure that all aviculturists would derive much pleasure in
exhibiting these graceful and gentle little Lories. The Fanning and
Washington Islands are their home.

By T. R. Holmes Watkins
In 1943 hybrids between a Golden-mantled and Mealy Rosella
were reared in my aviaries, being at the time without appropriate
mates, and one young cock was retained. In adult plumage he bore
a general resemblance to the Mealy but with his father's brilliance,
there was a rudimentary scarlet bib and some feathers of a similar
colour interspersed on the crown.
Having a spare Stanley hen, bred here in 1944, she was mated to
the hybrid this season but in view of the disparity in size it was hardly
surprising that only two of the clutch of six eggs laid should be fertile.
Both hatched and the young, believed two cocks, are now some three
months old. Bigger than their mother, whom they generally resemble,
they are, however, noticeably different from a pure Stanley of the
same age. The cheeks are largely blue ; crown, forepart of face, and
neck scarlet, and the upper breast speckled with the same colour.
The breast and abdomen are a sort of pale sea green and the mantle
more distinctly laced with brighter green and deeper black than in
a young Stanley. They are both extremely fine young and the only
Parrakeets that I have had that returned to the nest for the first few
nights.
Only four other hens were given nests as I was in the throes of
building a new range of aviaries. Between them they reared twenty-six
excellent young of which Princess of Wales only managed three.
Owing to the propensity of these birds to break the first couple of
eggs of the clutch and my own particular hen being somewhat fickle
in commencing to sit I have come to the conclusion that they should
be managed like Canaries, and intend, if we are all in the land of the
living, to remove the first four eggs of the clutch as laid next season.
Have any other breeders tried this method ? In my own case at
least it should show improved results, for of the clutch of seven laid
this season all had obviously been fertile, but, because of the above
causes, only three developed and were hatched.

i. The Kea {Nestor notabilis Gould)
By Jean Marie Derscheid
Translated and reprinted from Aviornis, Encyclopedie Internationale de L&apos;Elevage
No. i, Jan.-April, 1943, by permission of the Editor. (This article was
written by the late Dr. Derscheid during his imprisonment in Brussels.)
It is well known that the approximately 500 different species
which comprise the Order Psittaci (Parrots and Parrakeets) all have
such pronounced family characteristics that anyone, even if he be a
novice in ornithology, can recognize at once whether a species is in
that category. There are some rare exceptions to this rule about
w T hich it may be interesting to say a few words in this journal.
Firstly, there is a strange nocturnal Parrot, the Kakapo ( Stringops
habroptilus) peculiar to New Zealand, whose exterior appearance is
so strikingly reminiscent of the nocturnal raptores that one of the
first naturalists who studied it, J. Verreaux, hesitated as to where
to place it in zoological classification. This bird, which is remarkable
from a number of points of view, such as the almost complete loss of
the power of flight, is not content with resembling the Owls physically,
and even shares not only their predatory diet, but also their strictly
nocturnal habits from which the indigenous name is derived (in
Maori kaka = Parrot-- po = night). Like many other endemic
forms of New Zealand the Kakapo is in danger of complete extinction,
being unable to compete with the species introduced into the
archipelago by the Europeans ; it is now hardly ever seen in captivity,
even in the largest zoological gardens.
On the other hand, certain aberrant Parrots have during the
process of evolution acquired certain characteristics which gives
them a superficial but very marked resemblance to the raptores.
Phis is the case with three different genera which are not even related,
i.e. the genus Gypopsittacus of the family Pionida, the genus Nestor
of the family Nestoridce , and the genus Dasyptilus, whose position
is still undecided, but which various writers include with the Grey
Parrots or the true Parrots {Psittacida).
I will only briefly mention the Gypopsittacus or Vulture-Parrot, of
Brazil, which is characterized by a partly bare head and neck and an
elongated neck which gives it a peculiar appearance. This rare
species, confined I believe to certain districts of the basin of the
Amazon, is almost unknown in captivity, which justifies my silence
on the subject. It is entirely vegetarian in the wild state.
Better known are the members of the genus Nestor , which may be
termed the " Falcon Parrots " from their shape, and to a certain
extent from their habits. The Nestors are Parrots of heavy build,

notably larger and more robust than the African Grey ; their wings
are somewhat rounded, and their feet stout and armed with strong
claws. The tail is short and almost square. The general colour of the
plumage is sombre and far more like the birds of prey than that of
the Parrots ; but it is in the formation of the beak that the analogy
is particularly accentuated. The upper mandible is in fact both stout
and narrow, long and hooked, and solid at the tip. The under side
of the tip is smooth (as in the Lories and Lorikeets), that is to say
has not the projecting file-like ridges which are found in almost all
the Parrots and Parrakeets. 1 Differing from the beak of most birds
of prey the sides of the beak of the Nestors have not a notch or
"tooth" but an uninterrupted slight curve. The cere of the beak
is confined (as in the Platycercida) to two small knobs surrounding
the orifices of the nostrils.
The eyes are proportionately large, which is in keeping with the
mode of life which is as much nocturnal as diurnal, of these birds,
and the feathers round the eyes are placed more or less in a circle as
in the semi-nocturnal birds--the Buzzards for instance.
All the species of the genus Nestor are--or were--confined to the
New Zealand archipelago and to certain little islands situated further
north, namely the islands of Norfolk, Lord Howe and Philip. The
two or three forms which were peculiar to the latter islands have
been completely exterminated for more than a century, therefore one
can only consider the two species still to be found--though their
numbers are always decreasing--in New Zealand proper.
I will be brief on the subject of one of them, Nestor meridionalis
(Gmelin), and called Kaka by the Maoris, because I do not know them
except as stuffed specimens in collections and museums. It is very
rare in captivity, and I do not know if a single specimen has been
imported alive into Europe during the last thirty years. Without
speaking of the specimens (particularly during the last century)
which have figured at rare intervals in the large zoological gardens
(principally the London Zoo) the behaviour of Kakas in captivity
has been studied by two aviculturists, Linden and Rowley, and their
descriptions show that these birds have the same characteristics as
the following species which is better known to me personally.
The Nestor of the Mountains or Kea of the Maoris (,Nestor notablis
Gould) is the largest of the genus ; at present, at any rate, it inhabits
the highest peaks of the alps of the South Island of New Zealand,
almost always above the forest line ; it is not afraid to venture on
large expanses covered with snow, and on the slopes of glaciers, but
during hardest winter descends into the valleys to regions less arid
and desolate.

The plumage of the Kea is a general bronzed olive-green, brighter
than the brownish colour of the upper parts of the Kaka. In the
latter the under part of the body from the base of the chest to the
under tail coverts is a dark red, a colour which reappears on the nape,
the rump, the upper tail coverts, the base of the beak, and the under
coverts of the wing.
The red is far less extensive on the Kea and is not seen except on
the parts exposed when the bird is in flight or extends its wings--
namely the rump, the under coverts of the wings, and the feathers
of the flanks. In both species the olive and brown feathers are edged
with a black band which gives the general plumage its characteristic
scaly appearance. In the Kaka (but not in the Kea) the throat is
grey and the top of the head greyish-white, which gives the bird a
somewhat senile appearance. The Kea, on the other hand, has upper
flank feathers of red tending towards a fiery red or bright orange,
which is very striking when the bird flies in the direction of the
observer ; the primaries of this species are bluish and the secondaries
blue-green and slightly metallic.
The Nestors are not seed-eaters like the majority of other Parrots ;
their sickle-like beaks--which are also found in the Cockatoos of the
genus Licmetis and which also have a diet in which succulent roots
and insect larvae play a large part--enabling them to dig up the
ground in search of tubercles and nourishing roots--to peck off the
bark in order to catch the larvae of wood insects and to pull to pieces
for the same purpose the rotten wood of dead trees ; added to this
diet are berries, fruit, and as far as the Kaka is concerned flowers rich
in nectar which this species find in abundance in the forests which
they frequent. The Kea, on the contrary, has in less than a century
developed new tastes which are certainly less olympian and which have
earned it a bad name ; it formed the habit, when food was scarce on
the grasslands of its native alps, by adding the flesh of dead sheep in
the fields to its menu ; and was not long in attacking living sheep,
piercing the back with pecks of the beak in order to reach--so it is
said--the kidneys, its favourite part. In consequence the sheep
farmers of New Zealand have developed a fierce hatred for it, and
under their pressure the local government have paid a price for the
head of each Kea killed. As a result of this measure a considerable
number of Keas were killed, and now the species is only found in the
most inaccessible parts of its old habitat. For a number of years the
New Zealand authorities have lifted the ban which was in danger of
causing one of the most interesting representatives of the indigenous
fauna of the country entirely to disappear ; in addition, investigations
have shown that the amount of damage done by these birds to the flocks
of sheep was grossly exaggerated, and did not equal the amount paid per
head of bird which it was finally necessary to pay by means of taxes.

Be that as it may, the case of the Kea learning to attack and devour
a living prey unknown to its ancestors (up to the arrival of the first
Europeans, New Zealand did not contain any mammals other than
rats and bats), provides the biologist with a remarkable example.
I will not say " the organ creates the function " but at least the
structural adaptation (beak and claws of a raptor) has preceded,
and has made possible in consequence the special use of certain modified
organs.
Keas have always been rare in captivity, and there are only a few
zoological gardens in Europe which have kept one from time to time.
Among aviculturists who have kept them I mention my friend Sydney
Porter who has published a number of most interesting notes on the
behaviour of Keas which he has brought back himself from New
Zealand.
Three or four years ago one of my friends living in New Zealand
sent me various ornithological rarities, among them a pair of Keas
which reached Belgium in perfect health. I was somewhat surprised
to see them arrive in a sort of strong box covered with metal sheets
and adorned with an impressive number of padlocks. My Keas were
not long in providing me with the explanation of these precautions
(not even taken for the large Macaws with their formidable beaks)
by demolishing in one week more cages and twisting more locks than
all the Parrots in my collection had done in a year. The remark-
able thing about these supremely mischievous birds is that they
do not appear to use brute force in their work of destruction, but
begin by studying the problem methodically, one might say, and then
after having discovered the weakest spot attack it with skill and
tenacity. I had to have a special aviary made quickly with special
thick wire netting ; posts entirely covered with sheet iron and the
framework of the shelter in roughcast. Small trunks of oak were
given to them for perches, but in spite of the durability of the wood
had to be renewed periodically as the Keas pecked them unceasingly.
The two which were sent to me as being a pair, though having
exactly the same plumage, differed from each other considerably
with regard to shape ; the larger of the two had a more thickset and
sturdy appearance, and in particular a more massive head than the
other ; the latter in my opinion was the female, and in character
showed far less boldness than her companion. As soon as strangers
suddenly appeared near the aviary she hid herself in a strong wooden
box which I had placed for a nesting box in the darkest part of the
shelter. For the rest my two Keas were confiding and tame, even
taking meal worms from the hand of Mr. Yealland, my curator, who
had special charge of them and who they knew better than anyone else.
I have seldom seen birds in captivity so active and so amusing as
these Keas, and have never seen any to compare with them in

intelligence. Beside them the best Grey Parrots, the most affectionate
Cockatoos, the tamest Amazons have their dull days, moments of
bad temper, and periods of inertia and sleepiness. The Keas are
always alert, always on the qui vive, active, adventurous, devoured by
an overwhelming curiosity. Everything new attracts them im-
mediately, and it is said that in their country one of the difficulties
in catching them is their propensity for playing with the various
parts of the outside of the trap which is intended for them, and in
trying to take it to pieces, instead of going inside to reach the
bait.
Endowed with an abrupt and heavy flight, although powerful and
direct Keas are equally good at climbing, aiding themselves with
their beaks, and running agilely on the ground where they often
progress by funny little jerky jumps, turning the head at the same
time to right and left--then upwards. Their demeanour appears
always nimble and determined, attentive to everything. The smallest
novelty keeps them occupied for hours on end, and they sometimes
play in the most unexpected way with the most odd things. They
occupy themselves, for example, in emptying the water out of their
bath, using a cup or metal box for the purpose. Snow is a source of
amusement for them, and I have often seen them playing by fishing
out the pieces of ice from the edge of the little stream which flowed
through their aviary. It is needless to say that our greatest cold
(26 under zero) left these children of the high mountains of the
Antipodes absolutely indifferent. I suppose their relations, the Kakas,
would have been a little less resistant in this respect.
The voice of the Kea is strong and rather mournful--it resembles
a short sonorous miauw and certainly does not make one think of a
bird call, especially that of a Parrot. One hears it in the distance
as often late at night as during the day. The two sexes seem to me
to have the same cry. I have never heard my Keas (nor those which
I have seen in England) make the grunting noises which according
to Linden also form part of the vocabulary of the Kakas.
The food which my Keas were given during the three years I kept
them here (without showing a sign of illness) was both simple and
varied. Raw carrots formed the basis with the addition of other
vegetables such as radishes, stalks of celery, dandelion stalks, and
boiled potatoes. For fruit they were given an apple several times
a week, and sometimes a handful of chestnuts. The only seed which
they liked (not counting peanuts) was sunflower, and they wasted
it to such an extent that I soon stopped giving it to them. In
very hard weather I gave them cooked maize. Mr. Yealland has
seen my Keas accepting with much pleasure little pieces of mutton
fat, but I do not think it necessary to include this in their normal
diet in captivity.

Several times, seeing the female of my pair remaining by herself in
the box for whole days at a time I have cherished the hope that these
birds would finally nest here, and I had not given up all hope till the
beginning of 1941 ; the difficulties of the present time, above all with
regard to food, forced me to send my Nestors abroad. I hope one
day to possess them again. They are indeed birds of great personality ;
when visiting my collection our Honorary President, Mr. W. Frieling,
has told me several times that it was my two Keas which he envied
most particularly, an opinion which will be shared by all those who
have been able to make the acquaintance of this species which,
according to so many accounts is so attractive and remarkable.

THE BREEDING OF THE KEA
(.Nester notabilis)
By Sydney Porter
Prior to 1932 I had no occasion to be interested in the Kea. I knew

it as a peculiar Parrot reputed to have turned carnivorous and to
feed on the kidneys of living sheep which roamed over the Southern
Alps of New Zealand ; at least that is what the natural history books
would have us believe.
I had seen them occasionally in Zoological Gardens, large hawk-
like birds, but had thought them rather uninteresting. However, on
making the acquaintance of these birds in their alpine home I found
the Kea a bird of surpassing interest and one that has never ceased
to fascinate me the more intimate I became with it.
A good deal has been written about the so-called carnivorous
habits of the Kea, and no doubt the controversy will rage until the
bird is finally extinct--which unhappy state I do not think is far
distant.
I am quite convinced in my own mind that the assertion about the
Kea feeding on sheep, repeated ad lib. in every book which mentions
the birds, is entirely false. I should be equally ready to believe that
Macaws inhabiting Brazil had started to feed upon goats ! Every-
thing is done for the sake of cheap sensationalism, to foster the notion
that the Kea feeds upon sheep.
In museums stuffed Keas are shown tearing lambs (heavily daubed
with crimson paint) to pieces, and when pictured in a book it is
usually doing the same thing. No one has any direct evidence.
I found it was always from someone who knew a friend who knew
someone else !
Keas never lived long in captivity in the old days because, I believe,
mutton was included in their menu. In its native state the Kea feeds

berries, nectar sucked from the Phormium flowers, and also the
young shoots of plants, specially tussock grass.
Keas are by no means easy birds to procure, not that they are
difficult birds to catch, no bird is easier, but their habitat is so far
removed from civilization that their transport is a difficult and costly
business, and owing to the Kea's extraordinary intelligence and
ability to pick locks and open doors he is a very difficult bird to
confine in a small cage for very long. The intelligence and ingenuity
of these birds is incredible.
During a trip to New Zealand in 1932 Mr. Rowland Hutchinson,
of Auckland, who is the live wire behind the New Zealand Avicultural
Society, went to a great deal of trouble to procure two pairs of these
birds for me which I brought safely to this country. Since then I
must have had a dozen or more birds including a pair which I brought
back from New Zealand in 1938 after another visit to that country.
I thought at first that it was an easy matter to sex the Kea for
some had a yellow cere, also the lower mandible and a narrow ring
of skin round the eye of the same colour. This, I found out after-
wards, was merely a sign of immaturity, for as the birds got older
they became identical in appearance and a true pair are quite
indistinguishable except that the male has a bolder and more
aggressive demeanour. My Keas all lived fairly happily in a large
aviary about 25ft. by 12 ft. by 8 ft. high which had a shelter of
about 12 ft. by 6 ft. by 5 ft. The flight was gravelled and large pieces
of stone and tree trunks were placed about in it.
Considering what a very mischievous bird the Kea is, it was very
surprising that they did so little damage to the woodwork. Through
this aviary ran a gutter, taking the overflow from a pond in an
adjoining aviary, this was a never ending source of delight to the
birds who, like young children, delight to play with water. An empty
tin was an endless pleasure to them, it would be filled in the gutter
and then carried and splashed about, or it would be filled with stones,
one by one, and used as a rattle, or used to ladle the water out of their
bathing pan until it was quite empty. The tin would often be turned
upside down and a noisy tattoo played on it with the bird's beak or
a game would be played when the birds rolled it to one another by
pushing it along the ground with their heads. After about a week the
tin would be as flat as though it had been squashed by a steam roller !
Sailing small things on the water in the gutter and trotting along-
side them until they disappeared down the drainpipe was another
amusement. The birds always seemed so very surprised when the
article disappeared and with their head stretched as far as possible
down the drain the birds would try and retrieve it. They also loved
to stop this drainpipe up so that a flood would be caused in the aviary

and then their delight knew no bounds as they paddled about in the
water like children at the seaside. It was most amusing to watch
their efforts to manoeuvre a long pole or tree trunk down the drain
but they always managed to get it in.
The birds found quite as much interest in visitors as the visitors
did in them. You can never take a Kea by surprise, he always has
every situation in hand. If you want to catch him there is no frantic
flying about, he just dodges most adroitly then hides in a place where
he knows that you cannot get him.
When bringing the birds back from New Zealand they sometimes
got out of their cages into a large deck house which was used for
lumber. On arriving on the scene, the bird would instantly hide in
some inaccessible place and it was of no use darkening the room, for
the Kea can see equally as well in the dark as in the light and in the
aviary the birds are just as active at night as in the day. Judging by
the noise they make during the whole of the night they apparently
never sleep, in fact I have never seen a Kea asleep ; this peculiarity
is shared by quite a number of New Zealand birds.
Between the years of 1933 and 1946 I lost quite a few of the birds
until by 1945 I only had one pair left. Post-mortems on the dead
birds revealed no other cause of death but heart failure, and eventually
I realized that they had died of fear due to continual intimidation by
the mated pair which survived to the end. I never saw any fighting
but the pair would corner an odd bird and use the most horrible
(Kea) language to it, obviously using all kinds of dire threats, etc.
That the Kea has a definite language there is no doubt.
The mated pair had a kind of display which took the form of
playing with each other after the manner of puppies ; the cock
going up to the hen and playfully trying to push her over with one
foot ; he also used to feed her by regurgitation. The actual pairing
was a very long and noisy business. An aviary attendant I had some
years before the war told me once when I returned from abroad
that the Keas had laid eggs during my absence, but as he was an
inveterate liar I did not believe him.
The first sign of any desire at reproduction was in November of
1945 when I noticed a collection of small rubbish in one corner of
their shelter. As I thought it better if the birds nested outside, we
put a dog kennel, with the bottom knocked out, in the flight; we also
built little caves with large pieces of stone.
The birds laid in the kennel after making a nest of wood chippings
and bits of dried vegetables on which they were fed. Four eggs were
laid but after sitting on them for some time these disappeared. This
I think was attributable to rats which at the time, despite our efforts,
seemed to be overrunning the place, and were especially attracted
by the peanuts which were included in the birds' diet.

The Keas laid again in December in the kennel and after sitting
for a time the eggs again vanished, due I am sure to the rats. After
a short time the birds again commenced to accumulate rubbish in
one corner of the shed ; we then made a nest for them by throwing
buckets of soil into the corner and keeping it in place by surrounding
it with large stones and bricks. The birds took to this with alacrity,
making a nest on the soil with bits of dried vegetables, wood chippings,
and leaves.
At the end of February the birds laid again. Unfortunately at that
time owing to domestic troubles, ill-health, and the death of my
aviary attendant I was forced to part with my collection of birds.
I had already promised to send the Keas to the Zoological Society
but I thought I would let them try their luck with this clutch of eggs,
so they were the only birds I retained.
Owing to illness I kept no dates except that the first youngster was
hatched on 25th March, the incubation taking a little over three
weeks. Both birds took turns in the incubation ; the hen turning
remarkably shy ; as soon as she heard a footstep she was off the eggs
like a shot and hid under some stones or in the dog kennel in the
flight.
Four eggs were laid which were a glossy white and were about the
size of bantams 5 eggs. The youngsters hatched about two days after
each other and were a flesh pink when they hatched, but soon had
long tracts of white down on the bodies. A few days after they hatched
I was horrified to find them covered with what seemed to be dried
blood ; about this time I noticed that the hen soaked herself with
water every time she left the nest and the " dried blood 55 was really
the matted down discoloured by the red clay earth of which the nest
was made. I think the hen realized that the nest was too dry and
this was her method of damping it. The young grew very quickly
and in about three weeks were the size of fully grown Pigeons. The
parents at this time seemed to eat an enormous amount of food,
which consisted of all manner of root vegetables, excluding potatoes
which we later gave boiled, peanuts, almonds, hound meal, soaked
raisins, apples, but something seemed to go wrong, the young ones
stopped growing and in a short time it was obvious that they were
dying ; the parents were quite as concerned as I was and they indicated
that there was something deficient in the diet. We tried everything,
even mealworms and boiled fish, rice pudding, soaked bread, etc.
Two young ones had already died before I thought of lettuce ; when
we supplied this the adults made it plain that this was what they had
been waiting for. Four or five whole lettuces a day were eaten, every
scrap. This nearly broke the bank, for lettuces at that time were
2s. 6 d. each ! They consumed several pounds 5 worth a week.
Fortunately the price gradually came down after a while.

The nest was also sprayed with a fine horticultural spray and the
earth changed every week. Though the hen used to rush off and
hide, the cock was most solicitous about his offspring's welfare and
when I went into the shed he would always stand a few feet away
with that " I'm watching you " attitude. Quite frequently I found
full-sized rats in the shelter which had been killed by the parents.
These had been killed as neatly as if by a hawk. They were just
nipped behind the neck, which shows what power the Kea must
have in his mandibles.
After being exactly three months in the nest the young Kea left
for the first time on 25th June, but he always came back to sleep in
it for quite a long time after that. Like many aviary bred birds he
was much wilder than his parents, who in fact were quite without
fear as most Keas are.
Owing to the position of the nest it was, of course, perfectly easy
to watch the progress of the young birds.
Knowing that the birds in a wild state like to chew the tender
portions of tussock grass we pulled up tufts of grass and threw these
into the aviary. These were taken and placed under the young birds
in the nest.
When the baby Kea left the nest it was identical in colour and
size with the parents except that it had the cere, skin round the eyes,
and the lower mandible pale yellow. There also seemed to be a
lightish cap on the head. For some reason, due I think to a deficiency
in the food, the long point of the upper mandible never developed.
After about two months from leaving the nest the young one
suddenly became as tame as its parents and instead of rushing off
and hiding when I approached the aviary it became very inquisitive
and used to watch within a foot or two everything I did.
For those unfamiliar with the Kea I might mention that it is a
large hawk-like Parrot about the size of a Buzzard, a dull green,
each feather edged with black, the outer flight feathers are bluish,
the inner webs spotted with yellow as are also the outer tail feathers.
The rump is dull crimson and the under wing feathers and those of
the sides a brilliant orange, but this is only seen when the bird is in
flight. It inhabits only certain restricted alpine regions in the South
Island of New Zealand where the weather is even more uncongenial
than in these islands.
The following extracts from Marriner's book entitled The Kea will
give some idea of the nesting habits of this bird. " Were the Kea
surrounded by countless enemies it could not have chosen a more
impregnable fortress in which to rear its young ; it is a veritable
Gibraltar, and as such it usually remains unmolested." . . . " It breeds
in the deep crevices and fissures which cleave and seam the sheer
faces of almost inaccessible cliffs, that in places bound as with massive

ramparts the higher mountain spurs. Sometimes but rarely the agile
musterer clambering amongst these rocky fastnesses has found the
entrance to the run used by a breeding pair and has peered with
curious glances, tracing the worn track until its course has been lost
in the dimness of the obscure recesses beyond the climber's reach.
"In these retreats the home or nesting place generally remains
inviolate as its natural defences of intervening rocks defy the efforts
of human hands unless aided by the use of heavy iron implements
that no mountaineer would be likely to employ."
It has been stated that the Kea nests in June and July, which is in
the midst of the very severe alpine winter when the surrounding
country would be frozen and food difficult to procure. This I think
cannot be, for all the Keas I have had have moulted during July
and August and it is hardly likely that the birds would breed with
me in January when their natural breeding season was in July. Most
aviculturists know only too well that Parrots from the Antipodes are
notoriously conservative about their breeding season.

It may be worth recording two broods of hybrid Parrakeets reared
at Keston this season.
In the case of the first, namely Alexandrine X Lutino Ringneck,
two birds so nearly related must often surely have been crossed before,
but I am not aware of a case where one of the parents was a Lutino.
In this instance the parents were a cock green Alexandrine mated
to a hen Lutino Ringneck bred here three years ago. The Alexandrine
was bought as a Ringneck but as he was a good specimen, and as it
seemed impossible to get a cock Ringneck, we decided to keep him.
The pair went to nest at once and the three young ones were
magnificent specimens, as is so often the case with hybrids. Un-
fortunately one of them was found scalped after they had been out
of the nest for about ten days and, as their mother looked as though
she had been engaged in a brawl, it may be I left them overlong
with their parents and the hen had turned on and murdered one of
the young ones. If so this is unusual with Palaornis though common
enough with Platycercine parents. On the other hand, female Ring-
necks are adepts at scalping their husbands if the pair fail to agree as
to the most suitable time of year to raise a family.
At present the two remaining young ones look exactly like super
Ringnecks almost as big as Alexandrines, and are a good one-third

or more larger than ordinary Ringnecks. It remains to be seen, of
course, whether a cock would inherit his father's red wing patch.
What they have fortunately not inherited is the massive outsize in
beaks which in my opinion always gives Alexandrines a slightly
top-heavy appearance.
It seems not unreasonable to hope that from the remaining two
young ones, provided of course that one of them is a cock, and that---
as I have little doubt will be the case--the hybrid proves to be a fertile
one, we may eventually start a strain of Lutino Alexandrines, by dint
of breeding out the Ringneck blood by mating a cock hybrid back
to a pure Alexandrine.
Lutino Alexandrines, if they retain the red wing patch of the cock
in addition to the pink and black neck rings, should be even handsomer
than the lovely golden yellow Lutino Ringneck.
I rather think a Lutino Alexandrine has already been produced,
but I don't know who bred it, and as one never hears of any it seems
unlikely that the strain was perpetuated.
Hybrids No. 2, Mealy Rosella X Redrump, are not easy birds to
describe, but they are certainly a great deal prettier than I ever
imagined they would be. The odd cock Mealy and hen Red-
rump were originally only put up to breed as possible foster parents
for other Parrakeets' eggs, none of which, however, were available
when the hen Redrump started to sit.
Actually I should think it would probably be none too easy to get
a Mealy Rosella and Redrump to mate if one particularly wanted
them to do so, but of course, so perverse are birds, that it is child's
play provided one does not care in the least whether they mate or not!
They proved a most devoted couple and three fine young ones
were reared. In size they are about intermediate between a Mealy
and a Redrump, that is to say like a smallish Common Rosella.
They look from a distance, though not in detail when seen close to,
oddly like young Barnards. Roughly speaking the back is medium
green each feather being more or less laced, Broadtail fashion, with
black. The cheek patches are pale blue and there are considerable
areas of blue in the wings and tail. The breast is a rather beautiful
light bluish green and the crown of the head is creamy colour with
a faint reddish frontal band. The rump colour is brickish orange,
varying greatly in extent in each of the three birds. Their voices
seem to be inherited chiefly from their Broadtail father.
I have of course described them in their dull immature plumage,
but when all their colours are more defined and enhanced, as they will
be when they are adult, I think they may become rather striking birds.
If there is a true pair among them we propose, for interest's sake,
to try and breed from them, though I am afraid it is probable that
they will prove sterile.

In conclusion, for the benefit of the statistically minded, and to
ease the task of those who in later years may wish to compile breeding
records, and might justifiably be tempted to complain, with Dr.
Hopkinson, that searching for them distressingly resembles looking
for needles in a haystack, here--with a short note on each--is a
complete list of the hybrid Parrakeets which, at different times and
for various reasons, have been produced at Keston since we started
the farm twenty years ago.
Redrump X Hooded. --More striking and colourful than a Redrump,
but much less beautiful than a Hooded. Apparently a sterile cross.
Redrump X Stanley. --Only one young one reared. A poor dull-
coloured specimen and probably a female which did not long survive.
Doubtless no criterion as to the appearance of a healthy male hybrid
of this cross.
Redrump X Mealy Rosella. --Described in this article.
Blue-winged Grass Parrakeet X Turquoisine. --Fine specimens a trifle
larger than either parent, and, if I remember rightly, bright grass green
with a wide vivid double band of light and dark blues on the forehead,
considerable blue in the wings, and the faintest vestige of a brick red
shoulder patch. Apparently (and perhaps rather surprisingly) sterile.
Elegant Grass Parrakeet X Splendid Grass Parrakeet. --Rather less
beautiful than a Splendid, but much more brightly coloured than an
Elegant. The cock at first reminded one of an Orange-bellied Grass
Parrakeet, but now that he is fully adult he resembles a Turquoisine
with a large scarlet patch on the belly. The hen is almost indistinguish-
able from a hen Splendid, and though she got her nest ready this
season, no eggs were laid.
Browns X Common Rosella. --One of the finest and most beautiful of
hybrid Parrakeets, being more richly coloured than a Browns though
less gaudy than a Rosella. As both parents are Broadtails the hybrids
are of course fertile.
These were bred just as the war started and we parted with the
cocks but retained the hen. The latter--mated back to her Browns
father--has since produced a very beautiful male three-quarter
hybrid which, as might be expected, is almost exactly like a Browns
except that each of the head feathers, instead of being black, is crimson
broadly bordered with black.
Unfortunately this bird has always been a confirmed mysogonist,
and now lives alone as I eventually grew tired of rushing to the
rescue of any Parrakeet, male or female, which was put to share his
aviary.
Alexandrine X Lutino Ringneck. --Described in this article.

ONE PAIR AND THEIR PROGENY
By H. Manfield, Head Bird-keeper, Adelaide Zoo
If ever a bird charmed my eyes, it is the Queen Alexandra, and
the pair about which I am writing have done a remarkable job as
regards breeding. It is many years since this pair came to reside at
the Zoological Gardens, Adelaide, S.A. The male bird was an
exchange with a friend, and a wild bird from Central Australia, near
the Herminsburg Mission Station for natives. My friend was anxious
to obtain a pair or so from the Bush, and incidentally had a friend
at the mission whom he contacted and asked if any Alexandras
could be obtained by the natives. The reply was that if he could
send a colour plate it would help the natives considerably, and it just
so happened that the Avicultural Magazine had just published
a perfect colour plate (see Avicultural Magazine, May, 1935, front
cover) which was taken out of the book and forwarded on. To my
friend's delight back came a couple of pair or so of these lovely birds,
and one of the cock birds came into our possession by exchange.
About this time Alexandras were among the rare of rare, and we
were in the possession of three of these beautiful birds, one male bird
in particular was a magnificent specimen presented by Mrs. J. H.
Gosse, wife of the President of Zoological Gardens. Having only one
hen I decided to mate her to the new bird from the Bush. This was
in August, 1936, and how pleased was I when they mated and became
interested in the log, and in October of that year five eggs were laid.
These birds had never previously been bred in the Gardens and my
spirits ran pretty high when I looked in the log one evening when
the hen was off and to my surprise five lovely babies appeared.
I was advised by a couple of experienced fanciers to remove the
cock bird as he would kill the young, but I informed them I did not
think this necessary, as nobody removed them in the wild ; anyway
if they did I would do so next year. But all went well and five birds
left the log ; as a matter of fact on one occasion I timed the cock bird
go into the nest and stay in more than three minutes feeding the
young. This pair have quite a good record up to date, as the following
will show : five young, 1936 ; nine hatched and seven reared in
1937 ; four, 1938 ; six, 1939 ; five, 1940 ; five, 1941 ; four, 1942 ;
three, 1943 ; five, 1944 ; seven all died one week old, 1945, and at
the time of writing have five fine youngsters. The cage in which they
are housed is shown in the book Australian Parrots , by Neville Cayley,
p. 308, which also shows the birds and the log that has reared all &apos;

the young. The male bird becomes particularly tame when nesting
and will always settle on my shoulder and hand whenever I enter
the enclosure, and often nibble at my ear and almost ask for titbits, etc.
In fact he is that tame on two occasions I have walked out of the
cage with him on my back, not knowing he was there, but luckily
came on my hand and allowed me to walk back to safety. I remember
Dr. E. Hopkinson while on a visit to Australia paid a visit to the
Zoo and commented very highly on this particular pair and how
friendly they were. I doubt if a single pair of these birds in any
part of the world have produced such a record number of youngsters.
I suppose at present Queen Alexandras are one of the most popular
birds in South Australia. I have only once had a pair double brooded,
but a friend of mine had a pair hatch and rear eleven young in one
season. Another friend (in fact all bird men are my friends) asked
me which birds I would advise to keep to pay for the food, and on
a recent visit to his home I found he had no fewer than thirty mated
pairs and about fifteen pairs of Scarlet-chested Parrakeets (Neophema
splendida ) and about six pairs of Hooded Parrakeets (Psephotus
dissimilis) and all looking in the pink of condition and will surely
pay for the seed this year. The food of Alexandras is very simple,
and they are more fond of canary seed than other seeds, a little
sunflower hulled oats is eaten and they are particularly fond of hemp
seed, which is fed very sparingly and has been almost unprocurable
during the war. Apple is about the only fruit that is eaten by them.
Unlike most Parrots they are not fond of nuts, etc., but prefer greens
such as wheat, barley, oats in the heads, lettuce or thistles are also
relished. I often say it pays to move birds from one cage to another
if they will not breed. I remember a fancier asking me if I could
dispose of a pair of Alexandras as they would not breed. Not being
keen to sell a friend a pair of birds that would not breed, I asked for
a reduction in price, which was granted, and a sale took place, and
in the first season they produced six fine youngsters. So one can see
a change often does good. Alexandras in Australia are always worth
#10 or #12 per pair and are easy to breed. Aviculture has done
a wonderful job for Queen Alexandra Parrakeets as nearly all here
are aviary bred and very few birds have been taken from the Bush
in the last seven or more years, and should be there in fairly large
numbers now.

By E. N. T. Vane
Austerity conditions to-day have forced the aviculturist to experi-
ment with methods of management and maintenance which would
not have been contemplated ten years ago. It is interesting, therefore,
to compare the way one used to keep Parrakeets with the way one has
to keep them to-day. First, the stock itself, then their accommodation
and food. Has progress or the reverse been accomplished ?
In spite of the Parrakeet ban (no pun was intended on the word
6 4 spite ") the choice of birds available before the war was very much
wider than now, this was due to the fact that very limited importa-
tions were permitted under special licence, and also it was then
possible to provide suitable diet to ensure good health and stamina
in the breeding stocks established in the country, which incidentally
were definitely improving both in quality and number, so that it
should be understood that any comparisons drawn here do not
condemn previous methods, but rather inquire if others may not be
equally successful.
Practically all the Parrakeets left to-day are of Australian origin,
plus a few Indian Ringnecks and Lovebirds. There are still good
nuclei of several Platycercus and Psephotus, with rather fewer
Polyteline and the larger species remaining to us, not forgetting the
Neophema. Among the Rosellas, the much improved colour and size
probably accounts for the great increase in popularity of the Mealy.
This may be due to continued breeding in captivity, in which respect
they are undoubtedly much more reliable than formerly, and the
quality of the progeny produced now is excellent, and a great advance
on the rather washed out 44 Pale-headed " Rosella of some years
ago.
One scarcely ever hears of a Red Rosella to-day as nearly all
eximius are referred to as Golden-mantled ; some are crossbred,
but a few pure splendidus remain, it is surprising how many
newcomers are not aware of any difference until shown side by side.
Stanleys are fairly well represented, and although they appear to be
almost invariably single brooded, a number are reared annually.
Pennants are scarce, and Browns very rare, the latter always were
unreliable as breeders, and the males uncertain in temper, lack of
means to encourage breeding and absence of fresh blood have most
likely aggravated this rarity. In the Psephotus there are a good
number of Redrumps, very few Many-coloured, and scarcely any Blue-
bonnets or Hooded.
Coming to the larger species, Kings and Crimson-winged are far
from common, some pairs breed regularly, whilst others never attain

full success, and young birds are seldom offered. Barrabands and
Rock Peplars, which in my opinion never received the appreciation
they merited, manage to produce a few good youngsters each season,
but are very difficult to locate. The Princess of Wales' or Queen
Alexandra's appear to be breeding well, but one never seems able to
obtain any, the possible reason being that they are so delightful as
aviary inmates and definitely establish a personal bond with their
owners' who find it almost as difficult to part with one as to dispose
of a favourite dog.
When one considers the years of patient endeavour put into building
up stocks of Grass Parrakeets, the present position is most discouraging.
Inability to supply the essential diet is the cause of the present situa-
tion, which is maintained by the policy of restriction and controls on
materials and foods--a most disappointing anti-climax to victory.
Splendids are practically non-existent, and although efforts are being
made to pair up the few remaining specimens in the country to-day,
results are almost, if not absolutely, nil. Turquoisines are more
fortunate, as several pairs breed regularly and the birds available
must be English aviary bred for generations. Rumours of Blue-wings
and even Orange-bellies occasionally arise, the latter certainly had
never reached this country prior to the war, and no satisfactory con-
firmation is forthcoming. There are definitely a few pairs of Elegants.
A reasonable number of Bourke's still reproduce each year when kept
under proper conditions.
Occasionally an odd rarity crops up on the show bench, such as a
Salawatty King or a Timor Island Crimson-wing. A few breeding
pairs of Leadbeaters, Lemon-crest, and Roseate Cockatoos must not
be overlooked. There appear to be more Red-collared than
the previously more numerous Blue Mountain or Swainsons
Lorikeets, which still bring up families all through the year if
permitted.
Quite a number of the Indian Ringnecks survive, mostly described
as split Lutinos, so most likely originating from our President's collec-
tion. More information on these birds would be of interest and use
in breeding, as it is generally supposed that the Lutino factor is sex-
linked, but this is not always so. Reference to back numbers of the
Magazine will show that Mr. Ezra actually reared normal coloured
young from two Lutino parents, which suggests that there must be
at least two types of inheritance. I have a cock Lutino which came to
me as a guaranteed sex-linked hen.
Specimens of all the eight Lovebirds known to us before the war
are still in existence ; as the Red-faced have never been bred in
captivity these must be fairly aged. Peach-faced, Masked, and Fischer's
breed fairly regularly. Nyassas and Black-cheeks which used to be the
easiest and most prolific, now appear to be the reverse and very

scarce. The so-called Nyassas exhibited at the Horticultural Hall
were undoubtedly Fischer's, it is possible therefore that similar errors
are being recorded elsewhere.
An estimated census of the Parrot-like birds in the country would
be a very desirable achievement ; the correction of any glaring
discrepancies given here would be appreciated. Such information
might be the means of avoiding an undoubted avicultural crime
to-day, namely a whole season wasted with an odd bird when a mate
might have been located.
So much for the inmates. Now let us turn to the accommodation.
It was accepted as established " then " that Parrakeets did best in a
movable aviary about 6 to 7 feet high, 4 to 8 feet wide, and 20 to
40 feet long for each pair of birds, with substantial and commodious
sleeping quarters, heat being provided where necessary. Add to this
specification that the timber framework would be of generous pro-
portions, with netting of stout gauge and small mesh of half inch or
less, one wonders how it is possible to keep a pair of Parrakeets to-day.
The aviculturist who has not had his flights blitzed and has been able
to maintain or repair them, should give thanks for his blessings.
But what has his less fortunate confrere done ?
The usual materials not being available, alternatives have had to
be substituted. Iron or steel frames are more robust and enduring,
if more difficult to manipulate. Asbestos sheets, corrugated or flat
sheet iron, and even felt and thatch have had to replace timber, and
new methods have had to be tried out. Reclaimed timber is some-
times procurable. " Utility " aviaries have been reduced in size
to about 12 to 15 feet in length, and 3 to 4 feet wide. Netting is
frequently of 1 in. mesh. The shelters have become little more
than a combination of roof and windbreaks. Many flights are now
constructed in which the sides of the shelters extend for only three feet
from roof level, the front being open, or at most only half enclosed
from the open flight, and there is no floor but mother earth. The
interesting point is that birds have lived happily in the best of health
and condition, breeding regularly and producing sound healthy
youngsters in this accommodation. The requirements of Parrakeets
to-day appear to be only shelter from wind and driving rain, the
majority are quite indifferent to cold, and even dampness is not
detrimental to well being. Feeding is often arranged on a variation
of the ordinary garden bird table. Such birds as Rosellas, Redrumps,
Gockatiels, Cockatoos, and others prosper under this management.
Many choose to roost entirely in the open, which is only advisable
where there is no fear of cats, Owls, or vermin, and whilst it is not
advocated that birds should be forced to adapt themselves to these
rather rigorous conditions, the present unfavourable circumstances
need not prevent enthusiasts from getting going once more. The

larger species may be left until the supply of materials permits an
increase in the size of flight.
During cold spells, in some flights built ten years ago of asbestos
sheet, temperatures as low as 12 degrees Fahrenheit or 20 degrees of
frost have been recorded, at the same time the temperature in wooden
shelters of the same age was actually 2 to 4 degrees lower. It is not
simple to make an absolutely watertight joint at corners with sheet
materials, but experience has shown that Parrakeets are not affected
by damp patches on the walls. All they ask is protection from
draughts, wind, and driving rain. Certain species, notably Ring-
necks and Polyteline used to suffer frequently with frost-bitten feet,
but this is not nearly so often encountered now. However, it is
better to encourage these species to sleep under cover on a dry perch.
Grass Parrakeets and Lovebirds should definitely have a proper
shelter with a floor, although both Elegants and Turquoisines bathed
in the fresh drinking water the night after a record of 10 degrees
with no ill-effects beyond my own heart when I saw them.
The importance of fresh ground was possibly over-stressed, and
became rather an obsession. The birds are, I believe, happier on
grass, but it is difficult to find sufficient wire to go underneath to-day,
whereas concrete is more readily obtainable, and in view of the
reduced size of flight is not so large an undertaking. It is also easy
to keep clean, but grass flights are not soured quickly when only one
pair of birds are kept on a floor area of 50 square feet, especially if
only two perches are supplied, one under cover and the other in the
open. It is only the patches immediately under these perches that
are soiled, and these can receive special attention, and the birds derive
much benefit from the remainder of the turf in the flight. Before
leaving aviaries, it should be remembered that when one-inch mesh
netting is employed, a metal skirting about 18 inches high should be
fixed all round to exclude young rats, weasels, etc., and ^ in. must
be used underneath if on an earth base.
Nest boxes were very elaborate, and consumed an awful amount
of material in the old days, nothing less than a 6 ft. grandfather
clock nest or a hollow tree of equal dimensions would suffice. It just
cannot be done to-day. In Australia, the small sloping box or hollow
log was favoured. Provided this latter type of nest is placed in the
open and a moist cradle improvised for the eggs, birds bred in aviaries
for several generations are quite prepared to nest and rear healthy
progeny year after year therein. Grandfather clocks and tree nests
cannot be improved upon, but here are two well tried types of nest
used successfully for several years. For some unknown reason, birds
do seem to prefer the nest hole to face north, and to be of a size which
only just permits them to enter. The first type is only about 18 inches
to 3 feet long, according to the bird for which it is intended, it is

placed in a vertical position with the usual interior wire ladder, and
about 6 inches to i foot of peat in the bottom. Moisture is ensured
by fixing a screw-top honey jar under the base, which is drilled right
through to take a wick from the peat to the jar which is filled with
water. When a bird is sitting, the water requires frequent replenishing ;
this can be done without disturbing the hen with ordinary care and
patience. The second type is a sloping box at about 45 degrees, again
with the usual ladder and peat filled base. On the top surface a hole
is drilled about two inches from the bottom into the peat inside, and
then continued right through the base to allow surplus water to drain
off without fear of flooding the nest. Rain automatically keeps the

contents damp ; in dry periods the top of the nest can easily be
sprayed with the hose to obtain the same result. These nests have
been used by Broadtails, Gockatiels, Grass Parrakeets, and Love-
birds in various suitable sizes. The attached sectional sketches show
the arrangements clearly.
The biggest problem of all has been food. Many confidently
expected this headache to disappear with the end of hostilities. Pre-
war diet consisted of mixtures made from sunflower, hemp, oats,
canary, millets augmented by fruit, nuts, and greenfood. Although these
commodities are not absolutely unprocurable to-day the expense is so
exorbitant that it is quite an impracticable proposition. But by
substituting buckwheat and oats of inferior quality as the staple
food, with small rations of sunflower and canary and others of the
first mentioned seeds as obtainable, the birds have managed to give
a very satisfactory account of themselves and to breed excellent
families of a quality equal to or even better than previously. The
size of the broods are in my personal experience not quite so large in
number to-day, seven or eight in two nests is good, whereas broods
of twelve in two nests were often recorded. One group of food remains
at the same price, namely wild greenfood, and this is the main supply
during the summer. When birds are breeding they need bucketfuls
of chickweed, either fresh green leaves or when it is full of seed,
shepherds purse, groundsel, and sow thistle, bucketfuls is meant quite
literally. I am convinced that this is the direct cause of the increase in
fertility and quality of the stock.
Lovebirds do well on a Budgerigar mixture which includes canary;
they do not touch persicaria and seldom buckwheat, when other food
is available to them. By increasing the canary ration, results were
definitely improved, and their diet is completed with a supply of
sunflower. They can definitely spend the whole year outside, except
the Redfaced, Madagascar, and Abyssinian, but the sexes should be
separated to prevent attempts at winter nesting in impossible condi-
tions ; even then hens may try to lay infertile eggs, and require close
observation. Plenty of nest boxes for dormitories should be provided
in the shelters, although two Masked hens have spent two years in a
nest box open to the worst the elements can offer. They are, however,
probably more comfortable indoors without heat.
Grass Parrakeets do not take to substitute foods like Budgerigars,
and to achieve success they must be fed entirely on canary and millet,
they are possibly better off without hemp, but to make up for this
a few grains of sunflower every few days are appreciated. Normally
they do not eat a great deal of greenfood, but with young in the nest
they consume a lot of seeding grass and wild greenfood.
The great benefit derived from sprouted seed cannot be over-
emphasized, both before the breeding season and when rearing.

Canary and wheat when sprouted are rich in vitamin " E ", and
although few birds will touch ordinary wheat, they certainly like it
when soaked and soft, and the unmillable wheat sometimes available
answers quite well. To obtain the full benefit of the vitamin E it
should be fed for a period of some weeks ; in doing so care must be
taken to ensure that the sprouted seed does not become affected by
frost.
It is indeed fortunate that the extortionate increase in seed prices
is not reflected in the price of birds. Sunflower has soared from
around 14^. to #25 per hundredweight, hemp from 24s. to #28,
canary from 28^. to #30, yet the Broadtails and Grass Parrakeets
remain at approximately the same as in pre-war days, the larger birds
are a little dearer owing to rarity, and Lovebirds have gone up from
around #5 to #12 a pair. Apparently the only helping hand extended
to the aviculturist comes from his fellow aviculturist.
In conclusion, it may be of interest to give the following list of birds
which have been kept in flights similar to those described with no
heat. They have not been shut in at night, but allowed to roost
where they chose, provided it was not in a dangerous position on the
wires. Polyteline and Psittacula were always trained to keep under
cover, although they sometimes slept out in weather that was too
cold, in my opinion. Grass Parrakeets almost always slept inside in
cold weather, but generally outside under cover in the summer ;
this was not favoured by their owner on account of fear of night frights,
but the cocks were sometimes so persistent when their mates were
sitting, that it had to be tolerated. Lutino Ringnecks, Kings, Crimson-

Three hybrid full-grown Macaws were received early in 1945 from
Logan, Wigtownshire, where they had been bred in an aviary by
the late Kenneth McDouall. The parents accompanied these hybrids
and proved to be a female Blue-and-Yellow (Ara ararauna ) and a
male Red-and-Green (A. chloroptera )--the latter so frequently miscalled
Red-and-Blue, which is, of course, quite a different bird. The climate
in Wigtownshire is described as almost subtropical in summer, and

W. G. OSMAN HILL-HYBRID MACAWS IN SCOTTISH ZOOLOGICAL PARK 67
the birds were bred out of doors in a large aviary provided with
a brick shelter. After arrival at Corstorphine, where the birds were
added to an already over-populated aviary containing numerous
Cockatoos and several other Macaws, the parents of the hybrids
again went to nest in a bricked-in nesting hole at the back of the
84 ft. by 15 ft. flight (pure bred Blue-and-Yellow Macaws had in
1939 already been reared in the same place). Two eggs appear to
have been laid, both of which were thrown out of the nest and broken ;
one, at least, contained an embryo. Rats may have been responsible
for this, as there is a large rat population in and around the parrot
aviaries and elsewhere in the Park.
The adult hybrids are the same size as the Blue-and-Yellow parent
and in general plumage pattern rather similar ; but there is a pro-
portion of green in the plumage, whilst the yellow ventral surface of
the Blue-and-Yellow is replaced by a rich orange, which gives the
birds a most spectacular appearance.
Following is a resume of the principal features of the hybrid birds,
all three of which are alike :--
Brow-band dark red, something between crimson and chestnut.
Top of head bright green. The naked white cheeks are provided with
black feathered streaks as in A. ararauna , but they are somewhat heavier
in the hybrids. Auricular region, throat, breast, and abdomen reddish
orange. Nape bright green, almost viridian ; shoulders dull apple-
green. Primaries and secondaries blue, the primaries darker than the
secondaries, secondary coverts deep sky-blue. Rectrices steely blue
with some green on the webs of the central pair at about their middle,
these becoming gradually bluer towards their tips. Tail coverts
bright blue.
The bill is not wholly black as in A. ararauna , nor is the upper
mandible completely pallid as in A. chloroptera. The upper mandible
is mainly horn-coloured, but is black at the base and for a short
distance at the tip ; the lower jaw is wholly black. Legs are black.
Iris bluish-white.
I am indebted to Mr. T. H. Gillespie and Mr. B. Cunliffe for
information relative to the previous history of these fine birds and for
the details of their parents' attempts to repeat their performance
after their transfer to Corstorphine, where the climate must prove
much more trying to them. It is to be hoped that their efforts will
be crowned with success next season.

This bird came to us some two years ago through the good offices
ot the Zoo Man to whom it had been offered by one of his many
listeners and admirers. Had Polly not been christened in his youth
we should have called him Billy or some such name, for until he
produces an egg we shall consider him to be a member of the sterner
sex.
He came with the character of having no sexual preferences,
but on arrival he took several bits out of my fingers. However, by
dint of much courage on my part we soon became perfect friends
and now I can do practically what I wish with him, although he does
not like being held between one's two hands, apparently preferring
to have his wings free, just in case.
As a talker I venture to think that he has no equal, and the most
striking point about his chatterings is that they are all absolutely
apposite. It would really appear that he knows what he is saying.
This bird only enters his cage at night, his whole day being spent
sitting in the garden or on a little perch in one of our sitting-rooms.
When I leave him at night, more especially when I switch off the
electric light, he says " Good night dear " in an accent which suggests
that he learned this sentence from a housemaid who was a Cockney.
He is practically house-trained in that he is wonderfully clean in
his cage during the whole night ; in the morning he is put outside
my study door on an erection of branches which we call " the
gymnasium ". Here he immediately has an enormous action, which
shows that he has been containing himself until this moment.
He does not like being sprayed but if put outside during rain he
shows his pleasure by opening his wings and climbing into any
neighbouring bush where he can wet himself among the leaves. If he
is then given his bath, which is, in fact, a very large baking tin, he
gets so wet that he has to be brought into the kitchen to dry himself.
This room is really his favourite place of abode, for here he sees life
and gets many scraps. When our " charlady " puts on her coat to
go home, he says : " Good-bye, and thank you." He has also a habit
of tapping on the wall with his bill, after which he calls " come in "
in a loud voice. One day, during heavy rain, Polly wished to come
into my study by the garden door, but my dog was lying across the
threshold. Nothing daunted, he bit the dog's foot, at the same time
saying, " Get up Zelah, get out," and then calmly walked in.
Occasionally he climbs down from his perch and tears up the
newspapers which are spread below it. This is not allowed, and the
moment one of us enters the room he scrambles back to his place
saying : " Naughty boy--you naughty boy ! "

When he first came to us he used to say : " Are you warm enough ? "
when put into his cage, from which I inferred that he used to be
covered up at night. Another of his original sayings was " Hulloa--
Hulloa " followed by a lot of gibberish when he heard the telephone
bell, but of late he has taken to doing this also as soon as he sees my
hand go to the receiver to make a call.
From his gymnasium he can see me walk across the lawn with a
bowl of chicken food, and he can exactly copy the whistle by which
I call the hens at feeding time, so much so that if Polly is out there is
no need for me to whistle, all I have to do is to carry the food which
he at once recognizes.
His diet is extremely varied and contains very little of what is
now known as parrot mixture, but he always keeps an eye open for
a tit-bit.
While I was writing these notes I stopped to peel an apple--
immediately it was : " Polly wants a little scrap ! 55 At meals he
knows exactly what is on the table and continues to ask for a " little
scrap " until he gets what he wants, cake being one of his favourites,
though he throws out currants and raisins.
He is completely devoted to my daughter and copies her voice so
exactly that I am almost always deceived. Perhaps he shows his
greatest intelligence in connection with my dogs, of which I have
two : an old bitch, Zelah, my devoted, constant, and beloved com-
panion, and her rather boisterous son Whiskey. Polly knows these
two by name and never makes a mistake. " Come along Zelah old
girl," followed by my own special whistle and said in a gentle and
endearing tone. If the dog rushes into the room, it is : " Lie down
boy," or : " Get out Whiskey," in a very severe voice.
The appearance of a handkerchief and even sometimes of a duster
produces a perfect imitation of nose-blowing, and lastly, when he
sees me light a match for my pipe or cigarette he often coughs before
I do !
Such are just a few of the sayings and doings of our wonderful and
almost human little Grey Parrot.

Aviculture is now passing through perhaps one of the most critical
periods ever experienced. The loss of so many great collections and
the disappearance of numberless small ones through the devastating
effects of world war (the actual loss through enemy action added to
the even greater loss through shortage of food and personnel and the
impossibility of importing fresh birds) have brought the world's stock
of birds in captivity to a very low margin. It is absolutely essential
that aviculturists should combine to build up existing stocks and to
give each other every assistance possible. The importation of birds
to any great extent still appears very remote, but in the meantime
much can be done by breeding those species which remain in various
collections by pairing up odd birds.
An excellent start has been made by the Waterfowl Registry con-
ducted by Peter Scott, who has already arranged for the pairing up
of a good number of birds, which is an encouraging beginning for
the building up of stocks. It is hoped to extend this scheme to other
groups of birds and the next group to be taken are the Psittacine birds,
a registry of which Mr. A. A. Prestwich has kindly undertaken to
conduct ; and about which an article is published in this number
of the Magazine.
I shall be glad to hear of anyone willing to assist in further extending
the scheme by undertaking a registry of any other group of birds,
such as the Pheasants, or who may have ideas of developing the
scheme to the best advantage. The scheme is not confined to Great
Britain, and it is hoped that aviculturists in other countries will give
their close co-operation for the benefit of aviculture as a whole.

The Waterfowl Registry and Census conducted by Peter Scott
has proved such an unqualified success that it has been decided to
carry out another, on somewhat similar lines, devoted to Psittacine
birds.
It is not proposed to attempt a complete census of all the Psittaci-
formes, but to limit the registry to those species that are usually con-
sidered breeders. At present, breeding stocks of many species are

very low, and as there is little likelihood of fresh importations, even
in the distant future, it is incumbent upon aviculturists to make the
best possible use of such birds as we have remaining in this country.
Of several species it may truly be said that once the stock dies out it
can be regarded as lost to aviculture so far as we are concerned. The
Australian authorities seem determined to prohibit export to all
except favoured zoos, and in infinitesimal number for educational
purposes. Consequently, breeders must rely on their own efforts for
future breeding stock.
Home requirements apart, several species, particularly the Grass
Parrakeets, appear to be getting scarcer in the wild state and to be
doomed to extinction at an early date. And as the Duke of Bedford
has so frequently stressed in the past, unless aviculturists make strenuous
efforts some at least are fairly certain to become extinct. It is perhaps
late in the day to make the effort, but not too late. In Great Britain
there are some of the most experienced and enthusiastic aviculturists
in the world, and provided they have the birds there is little in the
breeding line they are unable to accomplish. Now is their chance
really to demonstrate what they can do !
It is hoped that the registry will show us just how many, or how few,
there are of the various species. Peter Scott gives the gist of the scheme
in his observation that it will probably be found that there is " a
number of unmated birds, odd males, odd females, which if put
together might perpetuate a breeding stock of the species, a stock
which would otherwise die out ".
A registration form is inserted in the present number of the
Avicultural Magazine, and all members keeping Parrakeets, etc.,
are urged to complete it. Should a member be the fortunate owner
of a pair of breeding birds of a species not listed particulars should be
given on the form. It is, of course, realized that there are many
breeders who are not members of the Avicultural Society, and it
would be appreciated if members would give the names and addresses
of any that are known to them.

Members of the Club, 31 ; Guests, 6 ; Total 37.
Dr. W. C. Osman Hill showed his film, partly in colour, Aviculture
in the Tropics. The film depicted inmates of a private collection,
devoted principally to Parrots, maintained by Dr. Hill in the Cinnamon
Gardens district of Colombo, Ceylon, and lately presented to the
Zoological Society's Gardens, Regent's Park. Additional scenes were
shown from exhibits in the collection of local species formerly kept
at the Colombo Museum, and others from the inmates of the Zoological
Gardens, Dehiwela.
The first shots showed a collection of waterfowl (Spot-billed or
Grey Pelicans, Indian Painted Storks, White-necked or Parson Stork
and Spoonbills) kept at semi-liberty in Colombo. The Pelicans and
Painted Storks were shown nesting in the trees and on aviary roofs. 1
Behaviour at feeding time was also recorded.
Next followed incidents in the life of several species of Cockatoo
(Palm, Citron-crested, Salmon-crested, and Slender-billed). An
aviary containing breeding Eclectus Parrots and Ward's Ground
Thrushes was next seen, and the curious sexual dichromatism and
persistent nesting behaviour of the former remarked upon.
Reminiscences were indulged in regarding the assiduity of parent
Eclecti in their reproductive behaviour and in the devotion of both
parents to the upbringing of their offspring.
Among the shots taken at the Dehiwela Gardens, those calling
forth most remark were the coloured records of the Australian Wedge-
tailed Eagle (Aquila audax), two species of wild Crow (Corvus splendens
and C. levaillanti ), Black Swans, and the Greater Adjutants, the last-
named with their curious dilated, sausage-shaped gular sacs.
A liberal proportion of mammalian studies was interspersed among

the items of avicultural interest ; these included an interesting study
of the Indian Pangolin, shots of large carnivores, Prevost's Squirrel,
a baby Axis Deer, and a pet Mongoose-Lemur.
A second short film showed the nesting in a flowering Hibiscus
of a wild Purple-rumped Sunbird (Leptocoma zeylonica ), the exploits
of a Japanese Chipmunk, and some coloured scenes from the life of
a pair of Queen of Bavaria's Conures. It was explained that the nest
of the Sunbird was a pendent structure composed of dried leaves and
moss, held together with spiders' webs and having a lateral entrance.
The flight of the female off the nest was recorded in the film. The
tameness and affectionate behaviour of the Conures was commented
upon.
The Chairman proposed a very warm vote of thanks to Dr. Hill,
which was carried with acclamation.
B. H. Dulanty said that he had hoped to show his Loo-Choo Robin,
judged best foreign bird at the recent National Show, but he deemed
it inadvisable owing to the severity of the weather. He described
briefly his feeding methods, but did not go too deeply into the matter
as Wallace Wood was speaking on the feeding of small insectivorous
birds.
Wallace Wood then said : The Loo-Choo Robin now owned by
Mr. B. H. Dulanty was for six years in my possession.
This delightful bird, not common even in Japan, was kept during
those difficult war years in perfect condition, and in full very fine
song, on much the same staple diet as my American Blue Birds (Sialis
sialis and Sialis mexicana) and Pekin Robins.
To a base of good biscuit-meal was added home-made milk cheese---
the size of a walnut for each bird--chopped not too finely. Grated
carrot moistened the mixture to a crumbly consistency.
The Loo-Choo and Pekin Robins appreciated an addition of
chopped lettuce and a great variety of fruits, elder, and blackberries,
apple, grape, and orange. The Blue Birds were not interested in the
lettuce, berries, and other fruits. All birds were supplied liberally
with cleaned gentles all the year round. Mealworms were fed at the
rate of eight or nine to each bird per day.
During the breeding season the Blue Birds seldom used the staple
mixture while young were in the nest, and the great difficulty of
finding a suitable diet for them during that period was that in early
or mid-April fresh live ant eggs were unobtainable.
In an attempt to find a suitable substitute, dried ant eggs soaked
for an hour in warm milk and drained were fed to them. They were
not received with much enthusiasm and proved practically useless.
Fresh ant eggs are easily the most useful article of diet for the early
days of feeding the young. The parent birds seem completely satisfied
if a plentiful supply is available to them.

<bodyText confidence="0.999014422222222" page_id="56289170"  page_num="74" year="" vol="">
During the first two or three days the young seem to be fed on
food regurgitated by the parents : it is after this period that the right
kind of food seems to be so vital, and it is then that the freshly gathered
ant eggs, straight from the mound, unsterilized and sorted from soil,
are so invaluable.
If these can be supplied the birds will use them almost exclusively
for several days, varying the diet occasionally with a gentle and any
other grub that can be supplied.
Fresh ant eggs sterilized, as supplied in season by the dealers,
make a very poor second best to the home gathered specimens, but
the birds will make do with them with a certain amount of success.
As the season develops the problem of supply becomes easier if
somewhat arduous ; earwigs, ground caterpillars, leatherjackets and
grasshoppers become increasingly available, and it is a satisfaction
to feel that there are several dishes of these different insects on the
feeding table.
My Blue Birds used grasshoppers more and more as the young
grew, one really good specimen satisfying a fledgeling for about fifteen
minutes. Care must be taken to immobilize completely these insects,
as they tend to recover from seeming complete execution in a most
miraculous way and leap to safety never to be seen again. Removal
of the legs after doing one's best to render them unconscious seems
the humane best.
Earwigs are received somewhat half-heartedly, but the strange
grey-white larvae and the fat olive-brown variety, found in the soil,
seem utterly irresistible.
Mealworms were rationed to about six small ones three times
a day while young were in the nest, and an unlimited supply of cleaned
gentles was always available at all seasons. To prevent these rapidly
turning into chrysalises during the warm months it is as well to keep
the stock in a refrigerator.
During the critical time of rearing the young the feeding table was
visited every hour or so to keep replenished any variety that was
running short.
Pekin Robins with young are much easier to cater for, as yolk of
egg is considered quite adequate by the parents, with gentles and
odd, easily come by, titbits.
Milk-cheese is easily made with cheese rennet, the firm junket
being drained in a bag, made of butter-muslin, for twenty-four hours.
I know some feed ordinary cheese grated. I have found it to be
indigestible and clogging for the more delicate softbills, and altogether
undesirable.
Tom Goodwin remarked that he had had the pleasure of judging
this Robin at the National Show, and that it had deservedly won on
condition and rarity. Some years ago when on a visit to Japan he

had tried to obtain examples, but had only succeeded in getting one.
Not only was it very scarce in Japan, but he understood in the Loo-
Choo Islands also.
The Chairman proposed a vote of thanks to Wallace Wood, which
was carried with acclamation.
The "J. F." Memorial Cup was on show, and the Chairman
explained that it had been presented in memory of John Frostiek,
an original member of the Avicultural Society, and a friend of practi-
cally all present.
H. J. Indge, speaking briefly on the simplicity of exhibiting, said
that the first necessity was, of course, to have the birds and suitable
clean cages. And then hope that the judge would know what the
birds were.
Miss Knobel said that she thought members were too inclined to
keep to their own little groups of friends, and she urged members to
widen their circles of acquaintances.
The meeting finally dispersed at 9 p.m.
The next meeting of the Club will be on 7th May, 1947. The
Treasurer begs to remind all members who have not already paid , that
subscriptions (5J.) became due on 1st January, 1947.

The " Crystal Palace " Show
The seventy-fourth " Crystal Palace " Championship Show of Cage Birds was
held at the Royal Plorticultural Hall, Westminster, on 16th, 17th, and 18th January,
r 947-
H. J. Indge, making his debut as a " Palace " judge, had every reason to feel
gratified, as he was faced with ninety-two entries in the foreign bird section, an
increase of fifty-two on last year's total.
There was no award for the best foreign bird, but Championship Trophies were
offered for the best birds in the Parrot-like, Seed-eater, and Insectivorous classes.
These were won respectively by F. C. Gooch's pair of Queen Alexandra's Parrakeets,
T. R. Crewes' Queen Whydah, and G. C. Lynch's Donaldson's Touracou. First
prizes were also won by W. E. Crowther, Leadbeater's Cockatoos ; C. Laidman,
Peach-faced Lovebirds ; F. C. Gooch, Mealy Rosellas ; T. Briggs, African Ring-
necked ; W. A. Upson, Red-collared Lorikeets ; T. R. Crewes, St. Helena Waxbills ;
H. Douthwaite, Red-headed Gouldian ; O. E. Dunmore, Purple-headed Starling ;
P. H. Alderson, Blue Birds ; and C. Gunton, Green Singing Finch X Canary.
Thus no less than eleven exhibitors shared the thirteen first prizes, probably a record
number.
Some other outstanding exhibits were : H. Douthwaite's Salwatty King, Timor
Crimson-winged, Blue-winged X Turquoisine, and Riippell's Starling ; O. E. Dun-
more's Fooks' Laughing Jay-Thrush ; T. R. Crewes' Blue-breasted Waxbills ;

Additions to the London Zoo
November, 1946. There were twenty-five additions during the month. The
most interesting was a Spix Scops Owl, Otus choliba crucigerus (Spix) from British .
Guiana, presented by Dr. Mary Letham. This species has not hitherto been repre-
sented in the Collection. Ten Snowy Egrets, Leucophoyx candidissima, were received 1
in exchange.
The death occurred of Sydney Porter's Active Parrot, Amazona agilis.
Among the Whipsnade additions bred in the Park, were a Blue Snow Goose, Chen
caerulescens , and a hybrid Barnacle X Bar-headed Goose.
December, 1946. The thirty-four new birds included a pair of Puna Teal,
Anas versicola puna Tschudi, a species new to the Collection ; one Superb Sunbird,
Cinnyris superbus ; six Temminck's Tragopans ; two Mikado, and two Peacock
Pheasants.
The Parrot House suffered another loss by the death of the Hawk-headed Parrot,
recently presented by Dr. Osman Hill.

The Hatching of Galapagos Penguins in America
An event of sufficient interest to warrant recording in the pages of the Avicultural
Magazine is the hatching of two Galapagos Penguins (Spheniscus mendelius) in America.
In January, 1939, Mr. and Mrs. Calvin P. Bentley, while cruising in their schooner,
visited Albemarle Island, in the Galapagos group. Six young Galapagos Penguins
were caught without injury, and taken aboard.* .All six eventually arrived safely at
the Bentley estate, Miami Beach, Florida. They flourished for some months when
four suddenly died, probably as the result of over-feeding. At no time between the

birds' arrival was an egg found until 31st January, 1946. A second egg appeared
six days later. Both parents incubated in turn and the two eggs hatched on the
forty-second day of incubation. One chick is described as being a lively little fellow,
but the other was quite weak. Unfortunately on the third day after hatching there
was a sudden sharp drop in local temperature, from 80 degrees to about 50 degrees.
This, coupled with the fact that the parents had not apparently fed the young ones,
proved too much for them, and they died on 21st March. This is undoubtedly the
first occasion on which Galapagos Penguins have hatched young in captivity. There
is a full account of the event by Dr. John Oliver La Gorce in Aviculture (U.S.A.),
vol. xvi, No. 2 (1946).

The American Pheasant Society
The American Pheasant Society held its 10th Annual Meeting at Philadelphia,
on 24th March, 1947. Captain J. Delacour (New York) was elected President,
Mr. Claude Hooke (California), Vice-President, and Mr. Fred. Sturgis (Penn-
sylvania), Secretary-Treasurer. The Society to-day has over 300 members, and
as it is estimated that 6,000 people keep and breed Pheasants to-day in North America,
the future seems to be promising.
Members receive a monthly magazine on game and sporting birds, Modern Game
Breeding , in which news of the Society's activities are given, as well as other items,
and there is also a special Yearbook (the fee is $3.00). European members are
welcome, and it is hoped that special arrangements can be made for an easy payment
of their subscriptions. Anyone interested should write to Captain Delacour, American

AUDUBON'S THE BIRDS OF AMERICA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998973416666667" page_id="56289173"  page_num="77" year="" vol="">
Mention was made by Mr. Prestwich in the January-February issue of the Magazine
of the " record " price paid for Audubon's The Birds of America. This (#2,700) is
far from a record, as a copy was sold at Sotheby's on 12th June, 1945, for the sum of
#3,400. Neither this nor the other copy mentioned by Mr. Prestwich was in good
condition. A perfect copy would fetch much more than the latter figure.
While admitting that Audubon's plates are very decorative, and that is the reason
for the high price of the book as these plates are in great demand in the U.S.A. as
pictures for wall decoration, his delineation of the birds themselves is not at all good,
many are depicted in ridiculous attitudes.
In spite of Audubon's affirmation that he would never draw a bird from a skin or
stuffed specimen, he obviously did so. One has only to look at the stiff, shrunken, and
flattened wings to see that nearly all his pictures were drawn from stuffed specimens.
One can nearly always tell by noticing the wings whether the picture of a bird has
been drawn from the living object or its stuffed skin.
The only plate which was obviously taken from living birds was the one depicting
the now extinct Carolina Parrakeet.
Audubon was as spectacular an artist as he was a man, but his paintings are not to
be compared for accuracy to either those of Wolf or Goodchild. The latter was an
early member of the Avicultural Society. His accuracy in catching the characteristic
poses of his subjects has never been equalled, and I do not think will ever be surpassed.
He died young, I believe, owing to the effects of the 1914-1918 war. Reproductions
of his pictures can be seen in the early numbers of the Avicultural Magazine,
also in Bird Notes , but those in the latter are much the best and some of them in the
earliest numbers are truly exquisite.

Goodchild's pictures can also be seen in the Ibis, Seth-Smith's Parrakeets, and a few,
the best of all, in Mathew's Birds of Australia. No one delineated parrot-like birds
with such accuracy.
Perhaps some of the older members of the Society who knew him could tell us
something about Goodchild, as I have always felt that he was little appreciated in
his day.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.973661625" page_id="56289174"  page_num="78" year="" vol="">
The London Natural History Society is; undertaking the production of a book on
the Birds of the London Area for the period 1900--1950. One part of this work will
be on the lines of a normal county history, and another section will be devoted to
the treatment of typical habitats and the effect of London on the avifauna. The
London Area is defined as lying within a circle of twenty miles radius from St. Paul's
Cathedral, including the whole of the counties of London and Middlesex, and parts
of Bucks, Essex, Herts, Kent, and Surrey.
We shall be most grateful for your co-operation in making the projected book as
comprehensive as possible, and ask you to make this project known to your members
while asking them to send any unpublished notes for the period to E. R. Parrinder,
27 Gwalior House, Chase Road, Southgate, N. 14.
The production of the book is in the hands of a committee consisting of Messrs.
C. L. Collenette, R. S. R. Fitter, R. G. Homes, E. R. Parrinder, and G. W. G.
Paulson.
We must add that any assistance provided will, of course, be gratefully acknowledged
in the eventual work.

(The Lyre-Bird ( Menura ) is found only in Australia, inhabiting heavily forested coastal
areas from Southern Queensland to Victoria. It is not related to any other existing
bird family, and is the sole survivor of a very ancient form of avian life. There are
only two distinct species, Menura novahollandia and Menura alberti, in the single
genus of the family.)
By Larry Boys
"To see so-and-so before I die," is an age-old, unvoiced ambition
of frustrated mankind. The stifled desires of a whole lifetime sometimes
focus on a single objective, the attainment of which would be justifica-
tion for a thousand mundane failures.
To many thousands of Australians the man-made wonders of the
world take second place after that elusive showman of the bush, the
Lyre-Bird. With quiet persistence they have resolved that this near-
fabulous creature is the one thing they must see before they die.
But few of them ever do.
For this talented artist, versatile up-stage prima donna of the forest,
performs only to very select audiences--all female--and by private
invitation only.
He is the Sinatra of the bird-world, and no wonder the lady Lyre-
Birds swoon over him.
Clearing a circular area in the thick forest undergrowth, he builds
a low mound which serves as a stage. Then, having called a Command
Performance with himself as the sole cast, he goes through his paces
for the benefit of his adoring audience of one or more hens.
Spreading his amazing tail, which is shaped exactly like an ancient
lyre, he clears his throat and bursts into passionate song, at the same
time dancing the most intricate measures, prancing and pirouetting
in every style from the classical to the modern.
The extent of his repertoire would shame the most versatile all-
round trouper in the Folies Bergere. The world's greatest mimic

and ventriloquist, he can imitate any sound that he hears. He will
unblushingly include in his recital the most personal mating calls of
the other denizens of the bush.
For added effect, and by way of confusing would-be bird watchers
in the vicinity, he will reel off the most realistic imitations of the sound
of a circular saw, a barking dog, an automobile engine, the whistle
of a train, the babbling of a stream, or the scream of a rabbit caught
in a trap.
Acute senses swiftly warn him of the approach of any interloper,
and he disappears noiselessly into the undergrowth before the intruder
arrives on the scene. Larger than an English Pheasant, he is aristo-
cratically reserved, resentful of any intrusion on his privacy.
The improbability of ever seeing a Lyre-Bird does not, however,
deter the many thousands of trippers who repeatedly make the
pilgramage to bird-sanctuaries in the south-eastern parts of Australia
in the hope of seeing one perform.
In Victoria the State Railways, private bus services, caterers, and
hotel-keepers derive a considerable annual revenue from the optimism
of people who are grimly determined to see one of these remarkable
creatures " before they die But to most of these hopeful pilgrims
the Lyre-Bird rarely represents more than a fluting melody of great
beauty echoing through a wild, mountain gully.
There is a story of a determined young man who concealed himself
in a hollow log near the clearing made by a Lyre-Bird and lay
" doggo " for several days, armed with camera and sandwiches.
All day long he lay there, hearing the song of Lyre-Birds all around
him, but never catching so much as a glimpse of one.
He returned to Melbourne, disconsolate, with some excellent close-
up pictures of a spider building a web over the entrance to his hollow
log--and retired to bed in the first stages of pneumonia.
Only very recently have naturalists succeeded in obtaining moving
pictures and sound recordings of the Lyre-Bird. Cunningly concealed
microphones, and camouflaged cine cameras operated by remote
control--and a lot of patience on the part of the operators--were
necessary before this could be achieved.
Known to early settlers as the " New South Wales Bird of Paradise ",
the males were shot in hundreds for the sake of their beautiful tail
feathers. This slaughter continued for years until, early in the present
century, legislation was introduced by the three Australian States
concerned making it an offence for any person to shoot or trap a
Lyre-Bird.
Force of public opinion also contributes to their protection, and the
birds are maintaining their numbers satisfactorily in their natural
haunts.
Of the many natural sanctuaries where the Lyre-Bird lives a

protected existence, the most popular among visitors is Sherbrooke
Forest, Victoria. In the thickly wooded foothills of the ranges of the
Dandenong Mountains, this superb wild-life reserve, about 30 miles
from the city of Melbourne, attracts many thousands of " Lyre-Bird
pilgrims " throughout the year.
So it was to Sherbrooke Forest that I went, a curious Englishman
on a short visit to Melbourne. After a train journey of about an hour
we disembarked at a little country station with the fragrant name of
Fern Tree Gully. A tiny village with a few shops and hotels nestled
behind a screen of flowering shrubs and trees at the foot of dark hills
whose heavily timbered slopes climbed steeply into the early morning
mists.
A bus carried us in a series of hairpin bends up into the mountains
and deposited us at the edge of Sherbrooke Forest itself. My high-
spirited feminine escort led me fearlessly into the green depths with
the easy confidence of the Australian in his native " bush "--
confidence I did not share for long.
The forest closed around us in a green sea of rustling fronds and
whispering leaves. Half-naked trunks of mountain-ash towered straight
as Egyptian obelisks to where their branches mingled two hundred
feet overhead. Nowhere were the great trees more than two or three
yards apart, and in between, among the eucalyptus saplings and the
golden wattle trees, grew the ferns.
Ferns everywhere. Great tree-ferns like stunted palms, with trunks
which assumed the distorted, fantastic shapes of a pantomime back-
cloth. And here and there, across the path, lay the fallen trunks of
forest giants, mouldering in a rich loam of dead leaves and discarded
gum-bark.
The damp heavy fragrance of rotting vegetation mingled with the
living scents of the trees and flowers, the resinous odour of the bursting
sap, the clean, bright smell of the peeling gum-trees.
I wandered on with the mixed emotions of a man who feels himself
in the presence of something ancient beyond all memory--in the
primeval forest, where the inexorable cycle of life and death has gone
on, unchanged, throughout countless thousands of centuries.
For a minute or two I was glad I was not alone. But I couldn't
help wishing I had brought a pocket compass.
In the foliage overhead colonies of gaudy-hued Parrots, Cockatoos,
and Budgerigars gossiped incessantly ; occasionally the sharp, stinging
crack of the Whip-bird cut through the air as clean as a knife. The
ribald mirth of a Kookaburra (" Laughing Jackass ") greeted us with
cynical mockery, and seemed to imply an uncanny foreknowledge of
the fruitlessness of our expedition.
We persevered. Threading our way through the tangled under-
growth we saw ample evidence of the existence of the birds we were

seeking. In the trees and on fallen boles and stumps were their
strongly constructed nests of sticks, bark, moss, and ferns. With
annoying frequency we came upon stamping grounds cleared by the
male birds, with their little earth mounds. But no sign of the Lyre-
tailed troubadour.
We sat down. And hardly had we stopped moving before the woods
awoke to the most wonderful song imaginable. The whole forest
seemed hushed to listen as the liquid notes poured through the glades,
echoing from the glistening trunks and caressing the shivering ferns.
The exquisite melody of the Lyre-Bird's serenade, once heard, can
never be forgotten. Like a virtuoso improvising on a theme, he took
the song of the Thrush, the soft chant of the Pilot-Bird, the whimsical
chatter of the Wren, and the laughter of the Kookaburra, and blended
them all into one glorious ballad, adding flourishes and elaborations
of his own composition. The resonance of the oboe gave way to the
sighing ecstasy of the violin. And then, with a few fluttering piccolo-
notes, it was all over.
We started up and tip-toed in different directions in the wild hope
of locating the singer. Goose-stepping through the low bracken ferns,
it was some time before I realized I could no longer hear my com-
panion. Afraid to shout in case I scared one of the Lyre-Birds which
I hoped might be near, I sat down on a fallen tree and emitted a short
whistle.
I am secretly proud of my whistle ; it is a double-noted warble,
which most people find difficult to reproduce. Imagine my consterna-
tion, then, when my own very personal whistle was repeated note for
note from at least three directions. I thought at first it might be a
freak sort of echo, but the staggered frequency of the sounds dispelled
any such idea.
Then I froze to the stillness of a statue as the ferns parted about
twenty yards away, and a large Pheasant-like bird appeared, whistling
cheerfully in the approved Larry Boys fashion. It was followed
shortly afterwards by another, which I took to be a hen. Intervening
ferns obscured my view of the performance which followed.
Still whistling, the cock bird slowly spread his wonderful tail in
a display which took my breath away. Then apparently deciding
that my whistle was not melodious enough for his academic tastes,
he launched into a song of his own.
It was this moment which my companion chose to burst hot-foot
into the clearing.
The birds vanished swiftly into the bush.
I looked at the intruder with pained reproof. " What goes on ? "
she cried. " I heard you whistling and can't locate you anywhere.
You seem to be all over the place. Just trying to annoy me," she said,

My knowledge of the existence of the Lyre-Bird dates from the
time when, as a child, I was shown a couple of lyre-shaped tails which
had been sent from Australia as decorations for a Victorian drawing-
room. In those days very few knew or cared what the bird was that
produced these pretty objects which served to collect the dust and
feed the moths until they were consigned to the dust-bin. Thank
goodness that fashion has passed, and now such wonderful creatures
as Lyre-Birds are protected by law and allowed to exist and display
their beauty as Nature intended them to do in the home of their
ancestors. We are told that, in spite of persecution in the past and the
introduction of the destructive fox and domestic cat, this most wonderful
bird is holding its own if not actually increasing.
I remember one example only in the London Zoo, which was
received on 12th April, 1900, and lived in the old Western Aviary
until 5th February, 1903. I recall its appearance, a fairly large brown
bird with large head and big eyes, long legs and large feet, active in
perching and jumping from branch to branch. It was not a showy
bird as it lacked the tail of the adult male, and the opinion of all who
saw it was that it was a female, but when it died, after nearly three
years in the Zoo, it proved to be a male, which goes to show that not
until four years or more of age does this species develop the con-
spicuous tail.
When I went to Australia in late 1907 I was determined, if possible,
to hear, if not to see, the Lyre-Bird in its native home, and I was
lucky enough both to see it and hear it.
When in Melbourne I was told that the Lyre-Bird would be certainly

heard if not seen within thirty miles of the city, at Fern Tree Gully :
so I determined to go there at the first opportunity. I was busy at
that time in making a collection of animals to take to the Zoo, and
had little time to spare for bird watching, but I decided to take a
half day for this special trip. The early morning being by far the
best time of the day for hearing and seeing birds, I caught an early
train from Melbourne on 13 th February, which landed me at my
destination soon after 7 a.m. Here I was able to obtain a breakfast
of sorts at the Fern Tree Gully Hotel, and then proceeded on my
ramble. A footpath led up the side of a hill through thick scrub ;
eucalyptus trees towered above and beneath the acacias, tree
ferns, cabbage palms, and many bushes I did not know. The whole
place resounded with the music of birds from the rich notes of the
White-backed Magpie and the melodious song of the Harmonious
Ground Thrush to the twitterings of White-eyes and Blue Wrens.
Suddenly I was quite startled by the whip-like crack of the Coach
Whip Bird, a fine cock of which appeared in full view on the path
in front of me. When higher up the gully I was greeted by bird-notes
which have remained impressed vividly upon my memory ever since,
the notes that I had specially come there to hear, the most powerful
and rich notes I had heard from any bird. The musical notes of the
Magpie, song of the Butcher Bird, and the calls of several other birds
that I had already learnt to recognize emerged from the depths of
the thicket, but all blended into one powerful utterance emerging
from the throat of one bird. There was no mistaking it for anything
but the song of the Lyre-Bird, the most powerful of all song-birds,
with unsurpassed richness and variety of melody, sometimes harsh,
but also of the sweetest and most tuneful description, the most expert
mimic of the songs and calls of other birds ; well may the Australians
be proud of this prince of songsters.
I sat and listened again on my return down the gully, but was
quite unable to catch a glimpse of the performer, for these birds are
adepts at hiding themselves in the thickest cover. However, later on,
in New South Wales, I was more fortunate.
Some sixteen miles south of Sydney is the National Park, an area
of some 36,000 acres of wild country mostly of thick forest through
which flows the Port Hacking River. Great care is taken to preserve
the indigenous fauna and flora and here the Lyre-Bird thrives in
comparative safety, and with any luck the naturalist may be pretty
certain to hear if not to see it. Four of us, all keen bird-watchers,
arrived at National Park Station after dark on 22nd February, 1908,
and, carrying provisions for one day, made our way down a long,
winding road to the Government Accommodation House, where we
intended to spend the night in order to start off on our bird-watching
expedition early the next morning. We tramped along the road in

the darkness (fortunately my companions knew the way) with thick
scrub on our right, while far below on our left we could just discern
the silver line of the Port Hacking River wending its way towards the
sea. The air was full of the sound of crickets and cicadas and the
croaking of frogs. We found excellent accommodation, and in good
time in the morning, though not so early as we had intended, as some
of the party were loath to leave their beds, we made for the boat-house
and were soon paddling gently down the river. The sun, which was
bright at first, was soon hidden by clouds which foretold rain, but
as the temperature was high and we were provided with mackintoshes,
we did not much mind if it rained or not. We had not gone far before
we heard in the distance the notes of the Lyre-Bird, while such common
birds as Kookaburras, White-shafted Fantails, and Honey-eaters
were frequently seen or heard. Gliding silently along we were
undetected by a Lyre-Bird feeding or drinking at the river's edge, until
we came close to it. In appearance it was very pheasant-like with its
long tail stretched out behind it as it ran up the steep bank or took
great hops from boulder to boulder.
The river wound its way through the wildest woodland scenery,
great crags and boulders of rock projecting from the banks which
were thickly wooded with gigantic gum trees, their huge roots twisted
into extraordinary shapes. Cabbage-tree palms, tree-ferns, banksias,
and numerous other forms of vegetation abounded and, at that early
hour of the day, there were no other human beings to spoil the scene.
We landed for breakfast, and while the billy-can boiled watched
numbers of charming little Red-eyebrowed Finches which brought
back memories of " Sydney Waxbills " in aviaries at home. A
Kookaburra appeared on a branch overhead and laughed at us and
a Lyre-Bird charmed us with his musical notes.
Paddling on through the rain, we watched a Yellow-breasted Robin
on a branch within a few feet of our boat, which took little notice
of our presence.
Satin Bower-birds, mostly in green plumage, Wonga-wonga Pigeons,
Pennant and Rosella Parrakeets, Grow Shrikes, Thick-heads, Sacred
Kingfishers, and many species of Honey-eaters were numerous, but
I remember especially the beautiful notes of the Lyre-Birds in this
charming spot. We often heard them at close quarters, but on three
occasions only did we catch a glimpse of a bird and then only when
quietly paddling down the river. Those we saw were males with
fully developed tails. The Australians call the Lyre-Bird the Native
Pheasant on account of its pheasant-like appearance, though it is
actually a passerine bird which makes a nest like that of a Wren on
a gigantic scale. We found one of these nests which appeared to
have been occupied earlier in the season.

The exceptional and prolonged arctic conditions which prevailed
in Great Britain in the Spring of 1947 were the cause of the death
of thousands of wild birds--Green Woodpeckers, Lapwings, and
Fieldfares apparently being among the greatest sufferers. As it will
no doubt be an interesting record and of value in the future
I requested a number of members of the Avicultural Society to send
accounts of how their collections fared during the bitter weather ;
these are given below.-- Ed.
1. How the Birds fared at Keston during the Cold Spell,
By D. H. S. Risdon
Considering how the wild birds have suffered under the severe
conditions this Spring, the foreign birds at Keston have done remark-
ably well. Gold seems to affect Parrakeets and the hardier Finches
scarcely at all and, apart from a few odd losses, which would probably
have happened anyhow during even a normal winter, we are starting
the breeding season with most of our breeding pairs intact and, in
fact, eager to go to nest now that the snow has at last melted away.
Infinitely preferable as they are for the comfort of man or beast,
mild, warm muggy spells of winter weather seem to take a greater
toll of foreign birds than do the hard cold ones. Why, it is difficult
to say, unless it is that the germs of avian diseases are more active
during warm spells and are themselves destroyed before they can
harm the birds in bitter weather.
I think quite frankly that we who looked after the birds suffered
worse than the birds themselves, slipping and sliding about on alternate
layers of snow, ice, and then more snow. Having with numbed fingers
to empty and refill every water pot in some cases twice a day, only
to find that they became frozen solid within a couple of hours of being
replenished, and struggling to open aviary doors which became stuck
fast with hoar frost wherever the wood was at all damp.
When the thaw set in it was quite a feat to remain upright at all
when going the feeding rounds. The whole ground became a par-
ticularly uneven sort of skating rink.
Knowing their susceptibility to frost bitten toes the Ringnecks and
Alexandrines were carefully watched for this complaint but we had
only one case--a hen Lutino Ringneck which, fortunately, was taken
in time and consequently had no ill effects. She is now, at the time of
writing, back with her husband out of doors and has already started
inspecting her nest-box which has just been put back in the aviary.
That particularly bitter night of the 28th February, when the
thermometer reached a record " low ", accounted for an old cock

breeding purposes by Miss Russell-Alien, and also a cock of one of
our best breeding pairs of Redrumps. The Hooded had been showing
his age for some time so his death did not come too much as a surprise
although it was sad to see the last of his species at the Farm--let us
hope only temporarily.
All our birds are shut in their shelter sheds at dusk throughout the
winter, with the exception of the Roseate Cockatoos whose aviaries
are only boarded at one end over the top, back, and sides. These
never turned a hair (or should I say feather !) and appeared always
fit and tight-plumaged throughout the worst of the weather.
The Blue-Fronted Amazon Parrots were unaffected by the cold
and remained outside, but our breeding pair of African Greys were
brought into the acclimatizing room for one reason as a precaution
against frostbite to which they are somewhat prone. In these days of
fuel shortage needless to say there was no normal heating in the above
building, an oil lamp being lit at night merely to keep out the frost.
Apart from this tendency to frostbitten toes Greys appear to be able
to stand cold as well as, if not better than, other Parrots.
The other reason for their removal indoors was because the cock,
in a fit of more than his usual diabolical playfulness, gouged his
wife's eye out last autumn. African Greys, even when apparently
happily mated, cannot seem to resist perpetrating sly tricks on one
another at the best of times, but this we felt was going beyond a joke,
so it was decided to separate them at any rate for the winter. Lack of
aviary accommodation compelled us to cage them side by side where
they could see but not actually get at one another. At the time of
writing they have just been put back into their breeding aviary and so
far appear to be enjoying the normal marital relations of Grey Parrots.
Budgerigars of course, as might be expected, survived the freeze-up
but, what was more unusual, so did the Canaries. These have been
outdoor aviary bred for several generations now, so this may account
for their exceptional hardiness.
All the Bengalese and Zebra Finches were brought into the
acclimatizing room as a safety measure.
Our entire stock of Broadtails, Manycolours, and Grass Parrakeets
were unaffected by the cold and remained in their outdoor aviaries.
Would that one could say the same for the unfortunate wild birds.
Dishes of water and what could be spared from the waste seed from
the aviaries were put out for them, but it was pathetic to see the poor
fluffed-out little bodies of Chaffinches, Blackbirds, Thrushes, and
Hedge-Sparrows hopping weakly about or crouching miserably under
the hedges, too wretched even to take wing at one's approach.
Incidentally one Robin solved the problem by taking up residence
for some three or four weeks in the acclimatizing room where a
constant supply of food in the shape of seed scattered from the cages

and water from the tap was assured. Whilst his relations outside
were at death's door, this particular Robin remained sleek and fat
right the way through.
Whether as a direct result of the hard weather or because hunger
made them tamer it is difficult to say, but for the first time on record

The birds here were very little affected by the weather and the
losses were confined to the extremely aged.
The more tender Pheasants, the various Peacock Pheasants, were
kept shut up with oil lamps in their shelters. The Monals, Mikados,
Edwards, Tragopans, Crossoptilans, etc., were never shut up and
invariably roosted in the open, as did the Formosan Blue Pies and
Wonga-wonga Pigeons. The Parrakeets were kept in during the
worst weather and were shut up at night.
The Princess of Wales Parrakeets, Lovebirds, and Red Mountain
Doves had a heated shelter solely because they happened to share the
same quarters as the Sunbittern, Touracous, and Rothschild's Grackles.
The waterfowl were never frozen in as they live on the river, and
barrowloads of waterweeds were carted in for the Geese and Swans.
On two occasions the Radjah Shelduck got their feathers coated with
icicles and had to be thawed out. The total losses were one hen
Tragopan, one hen Blue-winged Goose, and one male Radjah
Shelduck, all about ten years old. At the moment everything seems
to be laying exceptionally well.
3. The Gouldians and Winter, by P. W. Teague
The severe weather must have given most aviculturists anxious
thought, as owing to shortages of seeds and foods for the last seven
years it was doubtful if the birds had sufficient stamina to survive
the exceptionally cold winter, prolonged well into the spring and
following an almost sunless summer. However, I am pleased and
thankful to say my flock of Gouldians, ranging from three months
old to five or six years old, came through the ordeal exceptionally
well, for I did not lose a single bird, although I had many anxious
moments through lack of seed. We were completely isolated at times,
without even a post, but somehow a small parcel seemed to arrive
just in the nick of time. In spite of a small oil stove in the aviary the
water pots were usually a block of ice every morning. Here again
I had considerable anxiety, for we have no electricity, gas, or other
means of heating and are strictly rationed with paraffin, so the aviaries
were given a small share of our meagre ration of oil. Taking every-
thing into consideration the Gouldians have come through an

exceptionally severe test, proving that I have been able to maintain
their stamina under the most adverse conditions possible, lack of
sufficient seed, very little heat, and no artificial light for the long
dreary cold nights, surely a severe enough test for the hardiest even
of British birds.
My good fortune is probably due to close personal attention,
thoroughly dry aviaries, as draught-proof as I can make them. Lack
of sunshine was made up to some extent by a small quantity of cod
liver oiled seed daily, but the birds undoubtedly missed the sunshine,
and they also lacked occasional greenstuff, but this again may have

mended some years ago.

Had anyone asked me what task I found most distasteful in tending
birds I should not have been able to name any particular bete
non until this year of (dis-)grace. Without doubt, it is watering
the aviaries in a continued cold spell. First, one had to dig one's way
through feet of frozen snow and ice, then thaw out the solid bowls
and refill with warm water, and add the frozen contents to the absolute
mountain of ice blocks which accumulated over several weeks' unbroken
freeze-up from some sixty water bowls. Yes, I really disliked that job.
Clearing away several inches of snow and ice from the tops of flights
sadly in need of strengthening and repair after years of use as well as
disuse, knowing all the time that if any damage did result there was
no possibility of obtaining materials for making good, was a very
trying feat, but I still regard the watering as the worst of all.
Without comment on the severity and continuation of this year's
cold weather, it will be recalled that the meteorological experts
predicted the relaxation of the abnormal conditions, but suddenly
withdrew this forecast and the weather became even colder. I cannot
state definitely that my birds listened to the weather forecast and
were misled, but there is no doubt that this interim break was the
cause of the only casualties my stock suffered during the spell and
these were not " fatals ".
Grass Parrakeets gave a remarkably satisfactory performance. In
pre-war days Splendids and Bourke's had been wintered successfully
and happily without heat, but I would unhesitatingly have turned
on the heat if anything like such conditions had arisen then. Under
the circumstances in which we now exist this course was impossible.
Electricity was cut off (Sorry, the load was shed), and no other fuel
was available, with the result that although temperatures of 6 degrees
(26 of frost) were recorded inside the shelters, no heat of any kind
could be supplied. I have previously recorded that asbestos sheet
shelters were slightly higher in temperature than wooden ones. A pair

of Turquoisines and a pair of Elegants after a night in a shelter where
the lowest temperature was io degrees shocked me the following
morning by plunging into their warm drinking water in the open
and thoroughly soaking themselves, then flying to their perch and
preening with the temperature at 20 degrees F. Preparations were
made to bring them in at once, but they were dry in a remarkably
short time and it was not necessary to catch them up at all. There
were no losses and no cases of any indisposition among Grass Parrakeets
(Turquoisines, Elegants, and Bourke's) during the whole of the cold
period. They are trained to roost inside the shelters at night, the
flight entry holes being left open about 2 inches so that they are able
to go out early.
Among the larger Parrakeets, Crimson-wings will never roost
indoors, and have always used an open perch with only a sheet
asbestos roof and no side screens whatever : they did not vary this
routine in any detail and were absolutely indifferent to anything the
weather did. Kings usually roost out under a similar cover, but in
the coldest spells they elected to go inside the shelter, the door of
which is about 18 inches square, being left fully open.
Leadbeaters Cockatoos did not appear to know the weather was
cold, they just ignored it and kept steadily on with their demolition
of the wire and such timber that still remains of their aviary.
Two pairs of Princess of Wales always slept out, while a third
always slept in, they also weathered the storm with complete
indifference. Three young birds of the year, however, were in a rather
exposed all-metal flight, one cock had a bleeding toe one morning
so was brought in to hospital. Although the injury looked very slight
he eventually lost almost all of both feet and is quite useless for breeding.
The young hen had a swollen toe, from which she soon recovered
without any ill effects, the third bird came through unscathed :
neither of these were brought in. I believe the unlucky bird hung on
to part of the steel frame one night, but am not certain that this was
the cause of his misfortune.
During all cold weather I make a point of seeing that all Ringnecks
and Barrabands roost indoors. The former almost always choose to
do so, but one hen Barraband will persist in coming out for preference.
Having had trouble with the feet of these species years ago I always
take particular care to ensure that they are roosting inside. One
pair of Ringnecks were misled by the forecast as mentioned and
came out to roost in the middle of the worst cold. The split cock lost
one toenail on each foot and the Lutino hen lost one on one foot ;
they were only in hospital for a short time and beyond the losses
are none the worse for the experience. Two other pairs of Lutinos
were unaffected as they kept to their inside perch.
All the Rosellas and smaller Broadtails roost inside with the sole

exception of the Browns. None varied their routine and none appeared
to be a whit concerned about the cold. Many of the birds appeared
to enjoy playing in the snow. I remember seeing Princess of Wales,
Barrabands, Kings, Goldenmantles, and Mealies all running about
and picking up the snow whilst it was still soft.
Lovebirds did not like the extreme cold. A pair---or rather two
hens--of Masked had lived together for three years in the open, but
one died egg-bound towards the end of the cold, her companion was
brought in as they have nearly always laid their clutches of infertile
eggs at the same time, but the change of environment or the loss
of her friend affected her badly, and she refused to eat anything at all
and just faded away. Since the cold terminated I have lost some
more Masked and Fischers, one egg-bound and three with pneumonia,
possibly their stamina was lowered by the strain. Only one pair of
Peach-faced were outdoors, and these again suffered loss of toes
through frostbite. They had always roosted in the shelter, but changed
their minds and stayed out on a nest-box top when the weather
looked as though it was going to improve.
Although I have satisfied myself that these Lovebirds can stand a
normal winter outdoors without heat, the extreme cold experienced
this year rather shows that it is taxing their endurance very near to
its utmost, so they are probably better off indoors with the sexes
segregated to avoid likelihood of eggbinding. It surprised me to
learn from a naturalist with wide experience in tropical Africa that the
Agapornis have a very definite breeding season in their natural habitat,
generally about April when there is an abundance of young greenfood,
whereas in captivity in this country they are usually prepared to
breed all the year round with only a break for the annual moult.
May we never see another 1947 winter start to a year in my time.

One 1946 Ringneck cock died a day or so before thaw. All birds

Peplars slept on wire of open flight every night. A Cock Peplar left
complete tail frozen to wire one night, and after a partial thaw
both G.M.'s were coated with ice and were unable to open their

One pair of Redrumps went to nest when snow was a foot thick on

My nest-boxes are fixed on the outside of the flights against the
wire netting, through which a hole is cut corresponding to the entrance
of the nest. Yesterday morning I found this pair of Redrumps climbing
about on the outside of their flight, having chewed a small hole through
the back of the nest box. They both scrambled in again on my
approach as if they were ashamed at being caught red-handed, and
if it had not been for the menace of cats and Tawny Owls, both of
which abound here, I should have left them at liberty. As it was
I thought it best to secure them again and repaired the nest-box.
They had thrown three eggs out into the garden, and these were
infertile. Evidently those laid during the freeze-up.
The only other casualty was a young Peachick very late hatched
in 1946.
During the whole of the spell of bad weather the birds had no
greenfood, fruit, nor vegetable food, living on the seed mixture only,
and a very poor mixture it is, consisting mainly of Buckwheat with
a very small quantity of peanuts and sunflower, and a poultry scratch
containing poor quality oats. Water was given once a day only, in the
early morning, and remained in a fluid state for about an hour only.
With the exception of the Rock Peplars every pair is now busy
with the nest-box, and I believe five pairs have laid.

the Society have had many opportunities of seeing the selfless way in
which Miss Knobel has discharged her duties, and have learned to
realize that during her long period of service she has borne a very
great part of the burden of organizing the affairs of the Society. To
maintain its continued well-being has indeed been her one considera-

to mark their esteem and appreciation of her many services to
Aviculture and the members of the Avicultural Society. The members
of the Society were therefore circularized and invited to contribute to

record deep appreciation and thanks for the great kindness shown
to me and other members of the Avicultural Society by our colleagues
overseas. During the long weary years of war our lot has been lightened
and our hearts gladdened by a steady flow of parcels from New
Zealand, Australia, and America. Not only has the most welcome
food of all kinds, unprocurable in England, been sent to us but
our birds have not been forgotten and those seeds which became
as rare as rubies (and almost as costly), canary and sunflower, did
much in keeping our dwindling collections from utter extinction.
This tangible sign of friendship shown by the Societies and individual
aviculturists across the seas is one we in England will never forget,
and the realization of their thoughts thus shown for us helped more
than a little through the dark days of the last six years. Without
doubt the link of friendship between us has been even further and
permanently strengthened. May I, on behalf of all the aviculturists
in this country, express the hope that many of our colleagues from
our sister countries will visit us and give us the pleasure of showing
in some small way our feeling of gratitude to them.

Grey Quail are charming little birds, docile and confiding and
tamed in a few days, but they have night frights, and I remember
reading years ago in Bechstein's Chamber Birds that Grey Quail
disturbed other birds in the aviary at night. I think myself that it is
not only the migratory fever which makes them sometimes so restless
at night, but that when wild they must be partly nocturnal in their
habits.
Quail are generally thought of in India for fighting or for eating.
Pathans are fond of the sport of Quail fighting, and one can see at
times a great burly Pathan bumping a Quail up and down on the
back of his hand to strengthen its legs for fighting, for when Quail
fight they do not fight as do Gamecock or Grey Partridge by leaping
in the air, but standing on tiptoe, beak to beak, circle round and
round and try and push each other over. Hence, at times, a Pathan
may be seen massaging a Quail's neck. The flight feathers are pulled
out when first captured to prevent flight, and mostly fighting Quail
have the flight feathers pulled out or clipped.
Though Quail are kept in cages, miniature bamboo Partridge
cages, and I have seen them in small domed cages made of brass
wire, they are often kept in what at first sight appears a muslin bag.
In fact, this muslin bag, which opens and shuts at the top with a string
run through, has a netted base, netting stretched upon a round circle
of cane, as base, some 9 in. in diameter, the height of the bag when
held suspended by the string is 11 in. I imagine a " cut " from an
old lace curtain or a piece of green netting so often used for window
curtains out here, would also do well. It becomes, as it were, a dainty
hanging coat. The netting at the bottom of the cage is coarsely woven,
probably crochetted, and upon this the Quail can easily stand or rest.
Over the muslin bag is drawn at night, or even sometimes in the day
when the bird is carried, another bag of coarser material which excludes
the light and keeps the bird warm, for a captive Quail is sensitive
to cold. In the old days Quail used to be kept in Quail pits, darkened
cellar-like enclosures, and I should imagine their wings were clipped
to prevent night flights and disturbances which otherwise would do
them so much harm. Hume records that Quail could be bought at
Re. 1 to Rs.2 8 o per hundred. Those days have passed, but an anna
or a penny each is fair price to-day in the Jacobabad bazaar in Upper
Sind on market days. Quail also are used as decoys and one writer
says their owners give them as great care as a pack of hounds.
I have tried many times to keep these charming and, at first sight,
docile and confiding birds, but only lately have I found the right cage

to suit them and this was made to my design by a friend. I have kept
them in the usual bamboo Partridge cage, but though they kept well
for a time, sooner or later they would fly up wildly in the cage at
night and in the morning I have released them rather than let them
damage themselves further. Ultimately, if kept more than one in a
cage, they will fight among themselves and one will generally reveal
itself as a master cock-bird and chase the other birds about, pecking
hard at the nape of the neck until serious damage is done.
The cage we devised, and which I have now used quite successfully,
is an oblong cage made of bamboo on the same principle as the
bamboo Partridge cage, but instead of the domed roof there is a flat
roof of soft coarse woven stuff stretched over the top of the cage, so
that the bird, if it suddenly rises in flight, as it will do sometimes
with such great force as to move the cage itself, will not harm itself.
The cage is 8 in. wide, 8 in. high, and 16 in, long, and a sliding door
slips into the centre from the top in grooves made for the purpose,
so the 16 in. cage can be divided into two cages 8 in. square. I let
one bird, however, have the run of the 16 in. and I occasionally let
it out into a bigger cage made on the same principle but 12 in. wide,
8 in. high, and 24 in. long. I find a height of 8 in. quite sufficient :
it allows the bird to stretch to its full height and yet gives less room
for sudden flight. The doors at each end slide up and down so the
birds can easily be passed from one cage to another. Two cages are
kept on a small table in the verandah and the local Sparrows are
constant visitors to the Quail cages for the fallen seed.
Quail, though they love sun and the first rays of the sun will bring
them to the front of their cage to sun themselves, standing almost
on tiptoe, if need be, to catch the rays, are also birds of the shade,
and so I have covers, in actual fact coarse dusters, loosely covering
the sides and back of the cage, leaving the front only open, or I partly
move aside a cover to let the sunlight in from one side or the other.
When wild, Quail are mostly put up from cover, particularly they
like the protecting shade of cotton plants. Upon the floor of these
cages are put squares of jute canvas, commonly used for the bottom
of Partridge cages, though in Partridge cages sometimes only a small
square is fastened, sewn down in the centre to allow the bird to
stand or rest, the surrounding margins being left uncovered. But in
Quail cages I use a square big enough to cover the bottom of the cage,
and on this I spread sea sand. I have found thus far the best floor
covering not only for Quail cages, but for the floors of cages for other
birds. We can easily get a good gritty silver sand from a local beach.
Each cage has a small earthenware jar in one corner and in this
I put bajri, the small grey-green millet so useful as a food for buntings
and the larger seed eaters. I do not give water to the Quail in winter,
as in the case of Grey Partridges, water seems to give the bird

" snuffles ", a nasty but severe form of catarrh, cured by administering
small pieces of the centre of a garlick corm. But I give them pieces
of chopped lettuce or lucern which they take from the fingers, and
in the summer I hold a spoonful of water outside the cage and the
bird will come and drink, but never more than once a day, and that
in the morning. When I gave the birds water in a vessel inside the
cage I found the water spilled, the cage damp, and the birds miserable.
I believe in Tegetmeier on " Pheasants ", there is a discussion on this
question of water or no water for Pheasants.
I find Quail very fond of baked custard and they will run to the
front of the cage to take it from a spoon held up to the cage bars.
They are fond of white millet and the small Indian millet and of
lucern and grass cut into small pieces : they are also fond of white
ants, small gentles, and small grasshoppers. I have found the birds
do better in the smaller cages 8 in. by 16 in. than the larger cage
12 in. by 24 in. ; and even in the smaller cage they show their grace
and agility, and the manner in which they seem able to increase or
reduce their size, by the inflation or deflation of the plumage. I find
it difficult to distinguish the sexes and I do not know if I have yet
correctly done so. The books are not very helpful on the subject.
I think myself the hen has no black bib at the throat but the throat is
buff and the breast spotted, much like a lark : the males vary much
in plumage, but many have russet coloured breasts, of varying intensity
of colour. Unfortunately it is only lately I found the correct way to
keep these charming birds, and once one has a true pair I see no
reason why if Grey Partridge will lay in their cages and sit, Grey
Quail also should not do so, but an essential condition for success
must be the complete tameness of the birds.
I think it best always to get young birds of the year. They can be
distinguished by their smaller size and fine and more delicate legs and
feet, but even obviously old birds can be tamed in a matter of days,
merely by handling and keeping them hungry when they will peck
seed from the ground while held in the hand, even on the day of
capture.
Quail are commonly caught in nets with the use of decoy birds ;
they are often seen for sale crowded, quiet, and frightened into a small
domed bamboo cage. But shortly after they are moved into a larger
cage the master cock asserts himself and there is trouble, when it is
wiser to remove this bird and then the one which takes its place in
turn, till finally one will find one bird, or at the most two, left in the
original cage.
I do not think when I return to England I shall carry a Quail about
with me in a muslin cage, but I should like to save one or two from
a Gourmet's stomach and perhaps keep them in these small bamboo
cages which seem to suit them well. Perhaps, but perhaps not.

Only foolish or selfish people should try and keep pets if they are
in the Army, as sooner or later they are almost certain to have to be
either jettisoned or thrown on the mercy of strangers. I must confess
that I am more often than not both foolish and selfish, but during
my army life I managed to refrain from the temptation of acquiring
feathered pets until March, 1945. True I had previously to that
had at various times a Chameleon, a Hedgehog, a Turtle-Dove, and
several Quails, but they had been acquired under circumstances
where it would have been a far greater cruelty to have refused to
take them under my care. In the case of the Palm-Dove, however,
I was responsible from first to last. Ironically enough she was the
only one I deeply cared for--as well I might considering the absolute
trust and extreme affection with which she regarded me--and she
was the only one that I can have no reason to suppose had even a
chance of a reasonable happy life after leaving my hands.
It all began when one of my friends announced his intention of
catching a pair of Palm-Doves for me. I rather half-heartedly protested
that I did not want any birds, it being job enough to look after myself
and the pigeons in my charge. T, whose love of trapping birds and
beasts--poaching had, I gathered, been his chief hobby if not exactly
his sole employment in civilian life--was only exceeded by his subtle
Celtic ability to divine inclinations masked by insincere speech, was
adamant. " I'm going to catch those two that come to feed round
the Chippy's shop (Carpenter's shed), and if you won't keep them
I will," he announced, and that was that.
A few days later he burst into the tent: " Got them, Derek bach ! "
he announced excitedly and rather superfluously, brandishing a perfect
but very unhappy specimen of Stigmatopelia senegalensis egyptiaca in
either hand. I was just going out at the moment but I stayed a few
minutes to admire the birds and to damp T's ardour by telling him,
from the depths of my profound ignorance, that they would take
some time to settle down in captivity and would certainly not breed
for a long time if at all. On my return that night I was informed
that the doves were quite tame and had fed as soon as they were placed
in the large wicker cage where they were at present incarcerated.
Next morning I was agreeably surprised to find this statement in no
way exaggerated. At this time there was a rumour that we of the
Pigeon Service were soon to sail for home, taking our birds with us.
I need hardly say the rumour proved completely false, indeed when
we eventually left the powers that be ordered the destruction of all
the feathered personnel and only a few that were smuggled home

escaped the general massacre. At the time, however, I believed the
rumour--since most of us believe easily what we desire to be true--
and thinking that a basket full of Palm-Doves might easily be brought
over among many baskets of Racing Pigeons, I gave my full support
to the trapping activities and we soon had three more--a cock and
two hens. The pigeons in T's charge lived in a large aviary with
four adjoining roosting compartments about 7 feet by 4 feet by 7 feet
high. From one of these they were now shut out and the doves
installed. A few days later I departed for a fortnight's leave in the
Lebanon. One of the hen doves had begun to lose condition and
accordingly been set at liberty again, but the other two were feeding
well so I had no fears at leaving them.
On my return I was informed, together with much candid comment
as to my former remarks on the subject, that both pairs of doves had
started " calling to nest " a few days after my departure ; that there
had been continual fighting until one pair had been removed to
another compartment, leaving the original pair which were now
building ; and that in the removal the hen of the second pair had
escaped, but another had been caught to take her place. Needless to
say I was delighted with the turn that events had taken. The birds
were in the last stage of nesting--the site selected being on a ledge
formed by the top of a range of box-perches--the first egg was laid
on the evening of the 24th March and the second between 8 and
8.30 a.m. on the 26th. As is usual with pigeons the birds covered
the egg from the first but did not commence to incubate until the
second was laid. Both birds sat more closely than I expected them to
but whereas the hen would leave the nest if hand or face--it was on
face level--approached too close for her liking, the cock would puff
out his feathers, spread his tail, raise one wing and strike out valiantly
with the other. If the hen was on duty and left the eggs, her mate
as soon as he saw them exposed would at once go to the nest and
cover them, as of course will domestic pigeons in like circumstances,
despite statements to the contrary by some scientific writers who, if
they kept pigeons at all--which I sometimes doubt--must have had
very abnormal specimens.
The eggs hatched on the night of the 7th April, or before dawn on
the 8th. When two days old one of the squabs managed to fall over-
board and was dead when found, the other is the heroine of this
story, but for the moment we will leave her and deal briefly with
the doings of pair No. 2.
These latter were, of course, strangers to one another, the cock's
original mate having been lost as previously stated. They were housed
in an apartment identical to that of pair No. 1 except that besides
being used as a store for corn, brooms, and other such things, it was
also used as a hide-out by people unofficially off duty, and so more

often than not the doves had to share their scanty space with two or
three smoking, card-playing soldiers, quite apart from the constant
entry and exit of people requiring corn or implements. Under such
conditions not even the optimistic T anticipated any breeding, but
after a little while the birds paired and commenced nesting operations.
Then the cock commenced to chase the hen about in a most ruthless
manner, striking her furiously with his wings and tearing feathers
from her head and back with his bill. This appeared to correspond
with the " driving " phase which is such a feature of the breeding
cycle of the Stock-Dove and Common Pigeon. Subsequent observation
suggested that in a wild state the male Palm-Dove seldom manages
to overtake, far less to corner his mate at this period, but with the
captive birds it was otherwise, the poor hen being forced to spend
her time behind a corn-bin in the corner where the cock hesitated to
follow her. It was noticeable that whereas the cock Pigeon desists
from driving if his mate goes to the nest-site, the hen Palm-Dove
was allowed no such sanctuary. This state of affairs lasted some
twelve days and ended quite abruptly, the hen emerging from her
hiding place and flying up to the nest-site where the cock joined her
and they commenced the ecstatic cooing and head-fondling that is
indulged in by all the British species at the nest, and is probably
general among the Columbinse.
This occurred about io a.m. and nest building went on apace, the
first egg being laid a few days later. When the young were about
eight days old two others were added from a wild nest which had been
destroyed when the building in which it was situated was demolished.
Despite having four mouths to feed the old birds recommenced
breeding before the young left the nest. This time the driving phase
was less intense and lasted only four days. An interesting development
then ensued, since the hen did not approve of the earthenware nest-bowl
her mate had chosen and wished to nest in a box-perch some feet
away. For some days the cock spent most of his time calling alluringly
from his nest-bowl whilst the hen sat stubbornly in her box-perch
and ne bougeait pas. The clash of wills was not less interesting for being
(one presumes) not consciously recognized as such by the creatures
concerned. I inclined to the general opinion that as the hen could
produce a trump card in the form of the eggs she would get her own
way in the end, but I was wrong. One morning she became obviously
uneasy and at last got up and flew over to her mate. Building
operations proceeded feverishly most of the day and the first egg was
laid that evening. Both parents continued to feed the young until
incubation of the second clutch commenced, after which only the
cock was seen to do so. This second setting came to nought, however,
as the birds were allowed their liberty, via a pigeon-hole, as soon as
the young could pick up. They never re-entered the shed, although

for a little while they returned for food and water placed out for
them.
The squab of No. i pair grew apace, but when it was six days old
the cock bird recommenced driving with startling suddenness. (I
imagine the fighting that went on when the two pairs had been
trying to nest in the same compartment had in reality helped matters
by diverting the cock birds' attentions from their mates to one another,
and that when T separated them this tricky period was over for the
first pair.) At 9 o'clock all was well, half an hour later the poor hen
had hardly a feather left on her head and back. She was caged and
her mate spent his time raging over the top of her prison, although
to do him justice, he continued to feed his offspring from time to
time. After a day of this I released the old birds, who stayed together
and continued to visit the Carpenter's shed for spilt grain as they had
done before capture, and took upon myself the job of foster parent.
Before it could fly I made a point of often carrying it about on my
hand, taking it in the noisiest and most crowded places, as a result
of which it grew up absolutely fearless of human beings. When first
taken into the compartment where pair No. 2 were breeding it showed
immediate recognition of them and solicited them for food, but was
fiercely attacked on several occasions as a result of which its reactions
to its own kind became those of fear or indifference according to
their nearness and demeanour. I used to shave daily in its compart-
ment, a process that greatly intrigued the dove. Once when thus
employed, the bird approached my face (which was on a level with
the ledge on which it stood) in the typical manner of hen doves
desirous of pairing, mincing gait, shoulders slightly opened, rump
feathers raised, etc. She was then only about three weeks old and I
had previously had no clue to her sex, and was indeed much surprised
at such an early manifestation of sexual affection in a wild bird,
although of course such behaviour is almost a common occurrence
with domestic pigeons.
After she could fly freely she was kept in a small wicker cage in
my tent and at first was a great nuisance when let out, usually flying
on to a telegraph wire or other equally unreachable perch and
remaining there for half an hour or more before returning to me.
At this period she appeared not to differentiate between people,
alighting on, or allowing herself to be picked up by anyone. Wild
Palm-Doves she feared, and if attacked or displayed to by them
would flee in apparent terror, describing a wide circle and returning
again to my immediate vicinity. She showed at first considerable fear
of any bird seen in the air above her, Kites, Crows, Doves, Pigeons,
Swifts, and Swallows all causing equal alarm. At first birds at rest
at a distance roused no reactions, but after having seen them alight
a few times the sight of a Kite or Hooded Crow perched aroused

alarm even if the dove had not previously seen it in flight. This
certainly implies some degree of perceptive awareness and ability to
put two and two together, since pigeons have certainly no instinctive
fear or recognition of a non-flying hawk, but my bird never succeeded
in realizing the Kite's limitations (other birds it soon ceased to fear)
and always became extremely terrified at the approach of one, unlike
its wild relatives who normally show no fear of the omnipresent
scavenger.
The first time my bird saw a small dog which entered the tent when
she was on my hand she went quite frantic with terror, flying up and
beating against the tent roof till she fell exhausted. But within a few
days, during which she saw the dog about three or four times a day,
her fear of it diminished and eventually she displayed hardly any
fear, merely moving out of the way if the dog approached too closely,
and without uttering the alarm note--a moaning gasp like that of
the Turtle Dove--as she always did when uneasy.
As it grew older the bird would no longer fly to anyone but myself
when outside. She first attempted to coo--a hopeless squeaky effort--
on the 24th May, by which time she was in full moult. Now she
became obsessed with an urge to fly and when let out would sooner
or later dash madly away, often not returning for 24 hours or so.
Except on one occasion, when I was not present, she never returned
to the tent but to the compound where the Pigeon-lofts stood, where
she would hang about until I appeared on the scene. By the middle
of June she began to show signs of wanting to pair up, her first
manifestation of this since the shaving episode previously mentioned,
I myself being the all-unworthy object of her affections. On the 24th
June the dove was perched on my hand in the tent when a wild cock
bird settled unseen on the roof and began to coo loudly. I saw and
felt a thrill of excitement pass through the bird on my hand (this
may sound anthropomorphic, but if we veto all sympathy and emotion
when studying birds we shall learn little of such intensely emotional
creatures) and the next moment she had flown out on to the sand.
The wild bird--oddly enough her own father (we had rung all the
captives with coloured rings before releasing them)--flew down to
her and commenced displaying, at which she at once took wing and
flew away out of sight. Two days passed without sight or sign of the bird
and I began to think that some evil had overtaken her, since hand-
reared birds that succumb to the call of the wild invariably do so
gradually, except in romantic nature-stories. However, at noon on
the third day an Egyptian lad who did odd jobs about the camp and
was a good friend to me, came rushing up excitedly to tell me that
the " yamaman " was back in the compound. She was perched on
top of the high wire fence, ignoring the dozen or so people who were
trying to entice her down : when at my whistle she flew straight to

me and alighted on my head as usual I experienced the full truth of
the saying "That pride is empty, pleasure vain, has troubled few
when both were present
That little jaunt seemed to have temporarily assuaged the bird's
restlessness. She now openly regarded me as her mate, making continual
advances to me by day, and cooing in reply if I awoke in the night
and spoke to her. She " called to nest " from the top of her cage,
the immediate area of which was vigourously defended against all the
other human occupants of the tent. The dove was by now a general
favourite and no one would have dreamed of harming her but few
could resist from teasing, the approach of a strange hand into her
domain invariably provoking a spectacular display of fury from the
indignant bird. She never made a mistake and attacked my hand
even when, to test her, I and two others moved a hand each about
the cage-top simultaneously.
Learning that I was soon to sail for England I worried much as
to the best way to dispose of the bird. I knew of no aviculturist in
the vicinity ; Saad, the Egyptian lad, was fond of the bird and had
often asked me to give it to him. But I knew that if I did so she would
be caged for life, for he never failed to remonstrate with me against
my folly in allowing her liberty. I decided that it would be best if
the bird could be coerced into taking to a wild life, and past experience
of other pigeons suggested that its social and sexual responses might
in time be evoked by its own species if human companionship was
withdrawn.
When she next flew off I accordingly took care not to be in evidence
on her return, and after a few days she appeared to have given up
hope of finding me and no longer hung about the compound. Then,
one morning after she had been out for ten days, I saw her alight on
a fence about forty yards away. She had not seen me and looked the
very picture of dejected misery. My resolutions went to the wind,
I whistled, and in a moment the bird was on my head, uttering a
broken coo and shaking her wings in infantile expression of her delight
at our reunion.
When I left the dove was in my haversack. Once or twice during
the long journey to the coast she cooed in uneasy interrogation but
was at once calmed when I spoke to her. One of the most touching
and terrible things about tame birds is their faith in the goodness and
omnipotence of their owners, whose reasoning powers may be compared
to a bird's as the noonday sun to a flickering oil-wick in the darkness,
but who are none the less equally fallible and the pawns of an unknow-
able destiny.
To my dismay the boat proved to be more overcrowded than even
I had ever dreamed a troopship would be. Any liberty for the dove
was out of the question, I fed her through a gap in her calico box, :

she ate very little and I was in some fear for her health. At last--it
was only eight days but seemed like eight weeks---we arrived at a
transit camp in the south of France. Once inside a tent out came the
dove, and to my delighted surprise I found her in good condition in
spite of the fact that she had been unable to stretch her wings for so
long. I was quite aware that it would be imperative to imprison the
bird again the moment she had finished preening, but foolishly I
delayed the unpleasant moment, reflecting that I could always tell
by her movements a few seconds before she contemplated flight. . . .
For a moment I looked away, there was a quick flutter of wings,
and she was out of the tent. The world had changed ! No sand, no
white tents (they were green), no wheeling Kites, frightening but
familiar, green of grass and tree and vine, roof-tops redder than the
head of the Woodchat Shrike perched on the telephone wire, ... in
a sudden wave of panic she fled madly away. I never saw her again.
I had the galling knowledge that the bird was now in a worse predica-
ment than if she had been left in Egypt, and that it was through my
own folly that it had been brought about.
Some months later I received a letter from a friend still in Egypt.
. . . " Saad has caught a dove with a ring on its leg, we think it must
be yours come back as it is so tame. ..." It was certainly not mine,
and I often wonder if someone else also reared and then lost a Palm-
Dove.
* t. *
A few words as to the feeding of these birds may be of interest.
The old pairs were fed on the pigeon food which consisted of green
and yellow peas, yellow maize, tares, and lentils. The maize was
always picked out first and pair No. 2, which were fed by removing
the lid of a corn-bin and allowing them to help themselves whenever
they showed that they desired to do so (the lid being replaced when
they flew out of the bin and never being left open when the birds
were alone), were never seen to eat any other grain until they had
young when they began to take a few lentils and broken peanuts,
which latter had been previously ignored. Breadcrumbs, hard-boiled
egg, and greenfood were untouched.
My tame bird was reared chiefly on egg, peanuts, bread, and
soaked peas, and when it commenced to feed itself I tried to get it
on as mixed a diet as possible. It ultimately ate, in the following
order of preference, broken peanuts, hard-boiled egg yolk, scrambled
egg, millet, breadcrumbs, lentils, and sunflower seeds. Unlike its
parents and the scores of other wild doves that scavenged about the
compound, it would not attempt to eat maize or peas, these I often
proffered when the bird was ravenously hungry, but they were always
thrown aside and nothing could induce the bird to swallow them.

The Chairman informed the members of the Club that the Hon.
Secretary, Mr. A. A. Prestwich, was unfortunately prevented by
illness from being present ; this was the first meeting he had missed.
On the proposal of Mr. Ezra, a vote of sympathy and best wishes
for speedy recovery was passed.

The programme of the evening was then commenced, and the
Chairman stated that during the years between the two wars
Budgerigar breeding had enjoyed an ever-increasing popularity ; not
merely hundreds, but thousands, took up this fascinating hobby.
Under the guidance of the Budgerigar Society so much progress had
been made that the Budgerigar had come to be regarded as more or
less a domesticated bird, ranked with the Canary and domestic Pigeons.
In consequence, it had been, if she might say so, somewhat looked
down upon by the Avicultural Society, and not acknowledged as a
suitable subject for aviculture. Miss Barclay-Smith went on to say
that she was frequently having to contend the accusation that aviculture
was a pleasurable occupation only, and made no contribution to
science. She strongly refuted this accusation, but she would remind
aviculturists that through the breeding experiments carried out, the
Budgerigar had contributed more data for the study of genetics than
any other bird. The film to be shown was a detailed study of the
breeding and rearing of Budgerigars, and she suggested that cinema-
tography in aviculture might well be more developed as such records
were most valuable.
There then followed a display of a film in colour, taken by
Mr. Walter Higham, and kindly lent by Mr. Will Addey, Secretary
of the Budgerigar Society. This film showed all aspects of keeping
and breeding Budgerigars ; types of flights, aviaries, nesting boxes,
show cages, and travelling boxes were all shown in detail. A demon-
stration of washing a bird appeared somewhat drastic, but had no
ill results on the specimen. The film terminated with close-ups of
many different varieties, which were certainly strikingly beautiful.
The film without doubt fulfilled the object intended--to stimulate
interest in and show how to keep Budgerigars under the best possible
conditions.
Mr. P. L. Dabner, one of the foremost breeders and exhibitors of
Budgerigars, was then called upon to speak, and gave an informative
account of the present situation, and helpful advice regarding the
feeding of these birds, stating that they had taken quite kindly to
persicaria. Mr. Dulanty said his birds entirely refused to take this
seed, whereupon Mr. Dillon, Secretary of the London and Southern
Counties Budgerigar Society, suggested that a bird which was
accustomed to eat persicaria might be borrowed, for Budgerigars
were most imitative, and would probably take the seed if they saw
another bird doing so.
Dr. Maurice Amsler then gave a most entertaining account of the
big Budgerigar boom in 1926, and how he personally benefited by the
fantastic prices paid by the Japanese at this period.

The Shrike Starling {Scissirostrum dubium)
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.994500838709678" page_id="56289212"  page_num="110" year="" vol="">
In June, 1939 , seven Shrike Starlings were imported by Mr. J. W. C. Frost, of
which I possessed a pair. They were deposited in the Bird Room of the Zoo Small
Bird House for a short while in 1939 --therefore they appear in the annual report
for that year as they were new to the Zoological Society Collections. The bird is
almost entirely of a slate-grey colour, with yellow bill and feet, but the feathers of
the rump and upper tail coverts each terminate in a rigid glossy pencil or tuft of
glossy crimson. The sexes are similar. Its habitat is the Celebes, which it is peculiar
to and it is fairly abundant on the Island. My birds did very well on insectivorous
food, bananas, and mealworms. It cannot be said to have any song, but makes a
funny little squeaky noise which is a little difficult to explain. Some doubt has been
cast how this bird should be classified, but by most ornithologists it is considered to
belong to the Starling family.

A Collection of Guatemalan Birds for the New York Zoo
Mr. and Mrs. Charles Cordier have recently returned to New York after a year's
sojourn in Guatemala.
They first accompanied Dr. D. S. Newill on a special expedition to procure
Ocellated Turkeys for the latter's collection of game birds at Connellesville, Penn-
sylvania, one of the finest in existence to-day.
Mr. Cordier and Dr. Newill reared some forty Turkeys in the Peten province
of Guatemala, a hot, unhealthy, and primitive part of the country. They arrived
safely in the United States last autumn. Later on, Mr. and Mrs. Cordier made a
general collection of birds for the New York Zoological Society. It contains a
number of rare birds, which had not hitherto been kept in captivity.
One of the great surprises of the collection was the Guatemalan Junco, which
Mr. Cordier caught on a ten-thousand-foot peak in Guatemala, in a region of almost
perpetual frost. The bird looks exactly like the familiar Junco, or " Snow bird "
that winters in the vicinity of New York City, except that instead of black, beady
eyes it has bright yellow eyes. The Guatemalan Junco is one of several forms of the
Junco that have been isolated on remote peaks in Mexico and Central America.
Other oddities in the collection are the Grey-headed Pigmy Owl that stands

about four inches high, Cactus Wrens that hollow out nests in thorn bushes and
spiny cactus, and the Hermit Hummingbirds. The Guatemalan Hermit is a com-
parative giant, seven inches long, with iridescent colours and a long, spiky tail. The
Dusky Hermit is only about half the size. Most colourful are the White-eared
Hummingbirds, which have glittering blue head and throat, an iridescent green
chest and upper part of the body, a pink beak, and white streaks or " ears " alongside
the eye.

First Importation of Grey Parrots into Great Britain.
In one of the oldest French tapestries, dated about 1510, hung in the present
exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum, is an excellent portrayal of a Ring-
necked Parrakeet. This date calls to mind the opinion expressed in the recent
Parrot number that the Grey Parrot must have been the first foreign cage-bird
imported into this country. Such may indeed well have been the case, but at the
period mentioned, the reign of Flenry VIII, the Ring-neck had undoubtedly reached
France, and it is probable that it may also have arrived in England at about the
same time. The Ring-neck, as is well known, was kept by the Romans, but whether
they carried any specimens with them to Britain appears to be unrecorded.
It would be interesting to know whether this tapestry embodies the earliest repre-
sentation of a Parrot now extant in Europe. The bird is shown, apparently at liberty,
perched on the hand of its mistress, and forms part of a series of scenes depicting
the more refined forms of pastime then practised by the cultivated classes of the
age, amongst which it is gratifying to observe that aviculture found a place.

Many newcomers to aviculture are handicapped by their inability to obtain the
standard books on the subject. The majority of established aviculturists probably
have books they no longer require. It is, therefore, suggested that they either advertise
them for sale in the A.M., or give them to the Society to dispose of--thus benefiting

A PHEASANT REGISTRY AND CENSUS
By George A. J. Weaver, F.Z.S.
The two previous registers of birds in captivity have been so well
supported that a third one is now to be undertaken, embracing
Ornamental Pheasants, Peafowl, and Junglefowl, and it is hoped that
it will receive the same enthusiastic support as did its forerunners.
I hope Mr. Prestwich will forgive my recapitulation of much of his
copy published in the previous number of this Magazine, and can
only say that his remarks for the most part can apply to any group of
birds of which a registry is taken.
A brief survey will, I think, show that the existing stocks of Pheasants
in this country are at the moment very low indeed, the decrease being
due to the effects of the war and the lack of suitable foodstuffs. Coupled
with this is the fact that there have been no importations since the
outbreak of hostilities, resulting in a weakening of stocks for want
of fresh blood. Consequently, certain species have died out and
others have ceased to be represented in many collections where formerly
they flourished.
Regarding importations, the chances of new stock being brought
from their natural habitat to this country is very remote at present.
The war in the Far East has no doubt had its effect on wild stock,
driving these wary creatures still further into the impenetrable jungles
and mountain fastnesses, whilst some species may have been virtually
exterminated.
A serious problem confronts us regarding the high percentage of
impure stock now prevalent in our Golden and Amherst Pheasants.
This is not the result of the war, but to the indiscriminate inter-
breeding of these two species by inexperienced or ignorant fanciers
prior to 1939. The effects are now widespread, and it is doubtful if
more than a handful of pure-bred birds exists in this country to-day.

who was an active member of the old Ornamental Pheasant Society,
tells me he knows of only one person now possessing pure Amhersts.
One aim of this registry is to find if possible the few people who have
maintained a pure strain of each of these two species, and with their
co-operation to effect exchanges of odd birds so that full advantage
may be taken to pair up al birds of breeding standard. It will be
sad indeed if these two species are allowed to die out, and in their
place leave a hybrid that has neither the colour and daintiness of
the Golden nor the stately beauty of the Amherst.
I came across the following quotation some little time back in an
old journal, and it struck me as an appropriate conclusion to this
article. It applies more so to-day than at any time past, and it is up
to those who love birds to do all in their power to encourage our
feathered friends to live and breed happily in our midst.
" Man can destroy a species, but can neither re-create what he has
destroyed nor create a new species. 55

It is to be feared that the days are no more, and not likely to return,
when anyone, even with a small purse, could keep half a dozen species
of Pheasants.
Looking through my old notes, rather a saddening procedure, I
find that between the year when I retired to the country in 1936
and the first years of the war I kept about fifteen species of Pheasants,
every one of which bred here, though some, such as Amherst and
Elliotts, were by far the most prolific.
What fun it was going round the aviaries each evening searching
for, and picking up, the eggs--there is something quite exciting in
this pastime, partly on account of the actual value of some of the
eggs, and also because we all are, or should be, children at heart.
Who does not remember hunting for dyed eggs hidden in the garden
by our parents on Easter day ?
When the full clutch was laid we had to decide whether to give
the eggs to a Bantam or whether to entrust them to the hen Pheasant.
Some species especially Polyplectrons and Tragopans, make very good
mothers, but their efforts will be limited to one clutch, which in the
case of the former of these two species is only two. If you are acquisitive

(and who is not ?) you will therefore use a Bantam, if possible, and
double or treble your results. One season I bred 12 Ghinquis from
two pairs, leaving the little Pheasant to sit on her third clutch in
each case. The above species were, and still are, my favourites
among Pheasants, though I do not claim that they are more beautiful
or graceful than the much commoner Amherst or Golden, or even
the Silver.
These last three should still be available for those who have the
time to hunt round, but the price of a cheap species like the Amherst
has risen to about -#15, quite four times its pre-war value, and other
species will fetch prices in proportion.
There are still a few representative collections in the country whose
owners should do their very utmost to rear as many poults as possible ;
this and a Pheasant registry should ease matters slightly, and inbreeding,
which must surely come sooner or later, will have to be avoided by
exchanges or purchases from our friends in Belgium, France, and
America.
I have not touched on what may turn out to be an even greater
difficulty than the finding of the birds one requires. I refer, of course,
to the scarcily and price of foods. The war taught me that Pheasants
had hitherto been badly pampered.
Every fancier had his own favourite grain mixture, so much wheat,
so much hemp, dari, buckwheat, etc., etc., but the scarcity of cereals
soon showed us that these birds could be kept perfectly fit, and that
they would breed satisfactorily, on the roughest of mash made from
house scraps, potatoes, etc.
Even Ghinquis, who do not usually care about anything but grain,
thrived on a diet which I was rather ashamed to offer to my domestic
fowls.
Within the past few days the prices of meals and biscuits, which in
1938 cost from 17 s. to 20s. per cwt., has further risen to 805., and the
allocations have been halved !
All this is, of course, not the manufacturer's fault, but due to a
world shortage, and the fact that the Minister of Food does not
subsidize food for our animals as he does our household bread. To
crown our troubles potatoes are in short supply, even for human
consumption, for although they are said to be much too fattening,
I have always found them useful and wholesome. In any case, I
would rather suffer from embonpoint than starvation.
In default of the so-called fancy Pheasants, but only if you are certain
of obtaining the necessary food, there are certain birds of this order
which should be easily obtained. I refer, of course, to the " game
birds " which are bred for sport.
The old English Blackneck, P . colchicus , is an extremely beautiful
bird, and it is only our familiarity with him on the poultryman's

slab which causes us to overlook him ; then we have the Chinese
Ringneck, with a white collar ; the Mongolian, a darker bird than
the Chinese, and the P. tenebrosus , the " black 53 Pheasant, a very
handsome bird with bottle-green reflections.
It is questionable whether these can be found straight away at the
moment, but a collection of our game Pheasants would be a very
interesting one.
Writing of game birds reminds me of two pleasant experiments
I made very many years ago in rearing Partridges. A friend brought
me a sitting of French, or Red-legged, Partridge. At the time I had
never even reared a farmyard fowl, but I obtained a broody Bantam,
gave her the Partridge eggs, and also one of her own, which I thought
would make her sit more steadily. What happened was that the
Bantam egg hatched before the Partridges, and the broody walked
off and deserted the rest of the eggs, which I managed to hatch out by
artificial heat. The little broody refused to accept them and I lost
the lot.
The same friend next sent me some day-old chicks of both Red-
legged and Grey Partridges, which another broody hen accepted
and reared perfectly. This little family had the run of my small
town garden, and were no trouble at all.
A more delightful and tamer set of chicks it would be difficult to
imagine, and doubtless in a larger garden in the country they would
have stayed well and perhaps bred, but my flock gradually all dis-
appeared. A few, which flew away, were returned to me, stayed for
a time, and again went off; the others, I fear, may have fallen a prey
to cats.
In the same small garden the Indian Grey Francolin (F. pondi-
cerianus) reared young for the first time in Europe. The parents
were Indian-trained and as tame as dogs. A generous present from
Sir Godfrey Davis, I.G.S.
Although I mentioned my two favourite species at the beginning of
these notes, there are others which endear themselves during the
chick stage, and of these I have always found young Reeves quite
exceptional in their intelligence. They know their keeper as well
as any of the higher animals, and when coop-reared in the open
always run to him for food when he is still at long way away.
Elliott chicks, on the other hand, are tiresome, though very likeable
little rascals, for they have all an interesting habit of wandering,
and I have sometimes found my chicks of this species two fields away
from their foster mother who was confined to a coop.
It always surprised me that we did not have more losses or casualties.
Anyhow, it was pleasing to realize what an assorted and wholesome
natural diet these little foragers were finding for themselves.

Pheasants, as compared with such stalwarts as Mr. Spedan Lewis
and Captain Scott-Hopkins, I do feel somewhat guilty in having
allowed our Editor to persuade me to write these rambling notes, but
if I have succeeded in dissuading beginners from launching out on
too large a scale, my purpose will have been accomplished.
At the beginning of this year I could have had a quartet of Amhersts
for the asking. I was much tempted, for these birds would easily
have paid their way if the commissariat question was not so tight.
I hardened my heart and said "No thank you 55 . At the moment,
my only Pheasants are a pair of Temminck's Tragopans--the first
clutch is under a broody, and due in a few days--the second lot of
eggs are being incubated by the Tragopan hen.

THE PRESENT SITUATION OF PHEASANT
COLLECTIONS AND SOME ADVICE
ON KEEPING PHEASANTS
By Captain C. Scott-Hopkins, F.Z.S., F.B.S.A.
I was very pleased when Miss Barclay-Smith wrote and told me
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.981565428571428" page_id="56289225"  page_num="117" year="" vol="">
that the Avicultural Magazine was going to have a special Pheasant
number.
I was asked to write an article for this number, and being an ardent
admirer of these lovely birds I gladly acceded. The last time I
wrote on Pheasants in this Magazine I confined myself to Tragopans,
these being my favourites. The ornamental Pheasant world has
suffered grievously since then. Many species have disappeared
entirely from our aviaries. I doubt whether there is any collection
of any size remaining on the Continent. Mons. Delacour, who had
the finest collection in Europe, lost them all for the second time.
I was glad to hear that Mr. Fooks has quite recently started the
collection going again, but it will be many years before it will attain
to its previous size.
The only Pheasants which have been imported into this country
since 1939 are a pair of Tragopans and a pair of Monals. These birds
went to the London Zoo, which of course has priority. The result
is that our Pheasants are getting old and very inbred. This means
that unless we get some fresh blood soon the future for Pheasant
lovers is somewhat gloomy. The one bright spot in this country for
those who can afford the rarer species is at Leckford. Here they are
nobly carrying on the good work, and many species are being bred

there this year. There is also a splendid collection of Waterfowl.
My own collection, which was at one time, I believe, the second best
in the country, has sadly dwindled.
In 1939, when I was living in Yorkshire, I had the following species
in my aviaries : Golden, Silver, Amherst, Reeves, Swinhoe, Soem-
merring, Mikado, Edwards, Monal, Grey Peacock, Germain Peacock,
Bronzetail Peacock, Borneo Fireback, Vieillot Fireback, Siamese and
the Grestless Fireback, Satyr Tragopans, Cabot, Temminck, and
Blyth Tragopans. The Western Tragopan was ready to come from
India when the war cancelled it. Blue and Brown Grossoptilon,
Argus, Rheinhart, Elliot, Koklas, Cheer and Bulwer, Palawan, Ijima
in 1936. It was a collection to be proud of. The Yorkshire winter
was often too cold for some of them, such as the Palawans, Bulwers,
Bronzetails, and Tragopans. I found the Ghinquis Peacock Pheasant
one of the hardiest and easiest to rear, in spite of the fact that this
bird comes from one of the hottest parts of the world, the Burmese
jungle. I bred many of these delightful little birds in Yorkshire.
I have had no luck with them since coming south. I do not know
the reason, unless it is that the soil is too heavy here. I can thoroughly
recommend this Pheasant.
Unfortunately for the buyer, all Pheasants have almost doubled in
price, and many species are impossible to buy. The Silver, Golden,
Amherst, and Reeves are still obtainable. Pure Amhersts are still
almost unobtainable. I think I have possibly the finest collection
of Amhersts in the country. They are absolutely pure. I have also
a fine trio of Reeves, two pairs of Temmincks, one of Satyrs, and
several more. I am afraid after the severe winter many birds will
have perished. I do hope the time will soon come when we shall see
some Pheasants arriving in this country from abroad. In the mean-
while, let us carry on with a smiling face.
Perhaps a few little tips for beginners will not be out of place.
I must lay emphasis on one point : Don't start to keep fancy Pheasants
unless you are really fond of them. You will have many disappoint-
ments to put up with, and some anxious moments, so it is only the
real lover of these beautiful birds who can keep his head above water.
I can speak with forty years' experience behind me. My Pheasants
have been, and still are, a great part of my life. It is an expensive
hobby, more so now than it was, and of course the food problem is
difficult. But there are ways and means of surmounting even that.
Many people are driven to giving their birds soft food, and I am not
so sure that it isn't preferable to hard food. I know where it is
extensively used with good results. Plenty of green food is essential.
During the hot weather change their water during the heat of the
day. Keep your aviaries scrupulously clean. I perhaps go to extremes
in this case. I do, however, go slow in the breeding season. It is

<bodyText confidence="0.995140333333333" page_id="56289227"  page_num="119" year="" vol="">
advisable to disturb your birds as little as possible then. When
breeding I usually put the eggs under Bantams. Some Pheasants
are good mothers, some are not. I had two Amherst hens which
were splendid mothers. Peacock Pheasants are the very best mothers,
and the male an excellent father. With Tragopans this is different.
The hen is splendid and will incubate her eggs and rear her chicks
in a most exemplary manner. But take out the male bird as soon as
the hen starts to sit. He will constantly interfere with her when
sitting and when she is with her chicks. Pheasant chicks reared by
their parents are usually rather shy, and run away on the approach
of strangers. I have found that this lasts for quite a considerable
time, but when fully adult they become remarkably tame. I am
very fond of all the Tragopan family.
Constantly look round your aviaries for weak spots in the wire and
for rat holes. Never lay poison to kill the rats. You might poison
your Pheasants as well. Rats carry the poisoned food into the aviaries,
with dire results. Buy your birds in the autumn, preferably October-
November. When buying Amhersts or Goldens always try and buy
two hens. A single hen will never have any peace in the breeding
season, and she may meet with an untimely end. The Amherst
cock has a very vicious temper, and a dead hen is sometimes the
result. I experienced this last year. This sudden murderous impulse
that takes ho d of some species of Pheasants is a nasty trait in their
character. Even in their wild state, as on the Duke of Bedford's
estate where they breed, the keeper once told me that he picks up
some beautiful cocks which have been killed in deadly combat when
choosing their spouse.
Always have plenty of cover for these birds as with many others.
It is difficult to advise as to the best food for chicks. When I lived in
Yorkshire I was able to get plenty of ants' eggs from the woods not far
from my house. They just love these ; chopped up meat very fine is
relished, but it should be mixed with something else.
I think perhaps the least said about the food problem the better.
Everyone for himself! If I can be of any help at any time I will
gladly give it. I have nothing to hide. I just keep my Pheasants for
a hobby. I hate parting with any, but sometimes I have to say
good-bye to one or two now and then.
My last word to beginners is : Don't despair when confronted
with some bad luck ; persevere and you will get your reward.

By H. A. Fooks
Our Editor gave me one month or more to write an article for the
Pheasant number, but owing to the amazing amount of work a budding
farmer has to do the article was forgotten until a stern note from
headquarters demanded the article in two days !
Since the outbreak of the war Pheasants, so far as I was concerned,
were mainly viewed with an eye to how much meat they had on
them, although one unfortunate Kaleege chick accompanied me for
some time and subsisted on the less tasty portions of the American
" K " ration. Strangely enough it throve amazingly on the biscuits
which were said to contain all the known vitamins and proteins, but
which clung to the teeth like glue and which could only be swallowed
by human beings if the mind was rigidly kept on caviare and cham-
pagne. I eventually had to part with it to a brother officer, who
wrote to me a year later and said he had given it to a planter. Judging
by the rapt expression on his face when I handed the poult over to
him and as he ran his fingers lovingly up and down its breast bone,
I don't think he waited for it to lose condition.
My main experience with Pheasants was with the Calcutta Zoo,
which at one time really had a very fine collection, due, initially, to
the efforts of Mr. W. K. Dods. We found our largest " headache "
were rats, not only because they killed birds and ate their food, but
also because they spread disease. To exclude them from a row of
twenty large aviaries was almost impossible, though I managed to do
so for some time by very careful wiring with J in. mesh heavy gauge
netting and laying the same netting on the floor sandwiched in
between concrete.
What I did find out to be the most effective way of keeping them
down was to feed them. I had every occupied cage swept carefully
an hour after the last feed, and placed what was swept up into one
or more of the vacant cages. The rats very soon found this out,
and when these food places became well known, a dozen traps were
put down with excellent results for many weeks. I have since carried
this " rat concentration " method further by building a low wall
about 18 inches high, either circular or square, and leaving one brick
out every two feet. Scraps and waste were put into this enclosure,
and the whole covered with two or three sheets of corrugated tin.
After a week or so traps were set at each opening.
Our next trouble was lice, which started white and became blood
red. Each newly purchased bird had to be separately penned and
dusted with sodium fluoride and pyrethreum powder, mixed in

proportion of i to 3. I also made some stand in strong disinfectant
placed in shallow pans. As an internal disinfectant, aniline blue dye
was put in the water. Just sufficient to make it the colour of a 2 \d.
stamp, or until their excreta was tinged with blue. This seemed to
help in keeping down coccidioses. Onions and garlic were always
given with the food, and eaten more readily if chopped fine. None
of the birds was difficult to breed, more particularly if a little extra
attention was paid to them. The exception was, however, the
Monal. The eggs were rarely fertile or they did not lay at all. The most
easily procurable birds were Monal, Tragopan, including Blythe's,
various Kaleege, Koklas, and occasionally Cheer.
We had an old Cabot's Tragopan cock for nine or ten years. His
inside must have been genuine cast iron, judging by the fact that
he ate almost anything offered him by visitors.
Most of the Malayan and Bornean Pheasants were usually available
during December and January, though in most cases they were in
poor condition and required careful nursing. I remember writing
to the Ornamental Pheasant Society when it had just been formed,
and suggesting that I should buy Pheasants for them, and that they
should pay for a man to clean and feed them under my supervision.
They were only to pay for the Pheasants, man, and food. The
accommodation would have been in my own garden. They replied,
however, that they were only interested in live Pheasants delivered
in England. I was quite disinterested in the money end, though this
probably was difficult to believe 6,000 miles away. Buying birds in
bulk when they arrive in December, and then culling them week by
week, is to my mind certainly cheaper and most probably the best
way of securing really sound birds for breeding.
We once shipped two pairs of Tragopans and a pair of Monals to
New York, and I understand they were being exhibited three days
after arrival, and won a prize.
Travelling boxes need a double bottom, with not too fine a mesh ;
a padded top and a roller blind in front are also essential. We never
tried sending them in the way I described in an article on trapping--
enclosed in a basket with head, neck, legs, and tail left outside.
Wild-caught Golden Pheasants were comparatively rare in
Calcutta, though I did see a few brought in by Dutch ships which
had been on the China coast run. I was in all cases struck by their
small size as compared to the tame bred bird. In my estimation,
they were only half as large.
I remember how excited I was on discovering a cock Mrs. Hume's
Barred-backed amongst a rabble of Tragopans and Kaleege. The next
year, with the help of the Political Officer in the Naga Hills, I received
quite a number for the gardens, and some of these bred quite
successfully.

122 H. A. FOOKS-NOTES ON KEEPING PHEASANTS IN INDIA
It was this species that I suggested the Ornamental Pheasant
Society should purchase, as I think they had not yet been imported.
I was never successful with Blood Pheasants, mainly due to the
emaciated condition in which they arrived. Haliborange and various
other concentrates, although eagerly taken, did not seem to help
them put on weight. It is really remarkable how some of the Pheasants
brought down to Calcutta survive the journey, as the majority of
them would be caught at least two or three days' march from the
nearest railway. Add to this three or four days for collecting several
lots before the journey commences, and another two days haggling
over the price when the journey is over, and the total cannot be far
short of ten days, probably longer.
For the Naga hills we had our own arrangements with a Naga
keeper at Kohima, who penned the birds up there, and when they
had settled down brought them to Calcutta.
I once took him to the cinema, where he caused a certain amount
of disturbance by insisting on sitting on the floor in the gangway,
where he looked most picturesque with his red blanket and human
hair " garters ".
I hope next year to try and breed some Pheasants here, but I am
very handicapped owing to the fact that I am a comparative stranger
in England, coupled to the fact that the food has to be grown on the
farm. And I would be exceedingly grateful if any members could
give me any advice as to what would be most suitable to start with
in England, or where I could purchase or borrow a pair of Monal,
Golden, or any other of the easier and more common species. There
is a Golden cock here at least seven years old which I have been unable
to catch and which has evaded all the local poachers. There is no
sign of any crosses amongst the remaining wild Pheasants.

It is probably correct to state that Pheasants, referring to the many
varieties and species spread throughout Asia, the Far East, Malaya,
etc., suffered more losses than any other birds during the war years.
Birds from Africa, the South Seas, Australia, New Zealand, South
America, etc., were affected in no adverse manner. I am not in
a position to make a positive statement regarding Pheasant life in
Asia and elsewhere, but one has little cause to call on one's imagina-
tion to surmise that the toll taken in India, China, and Japan must
and will be colossal. It is useless to argue that because Pheasants
live in wild and desolate areas that they are therefore immune from
traps, firearms, etc. Here is an extract from a letter I received from
India late in 1945 ; it is sad, but I am afraid true : "You will be
sorry to know that the Indian native has developed a keen sense in
the killing of many species of Pheasants, this not from any monetary
gain, but purely for the pot. I do not know where or from whom
they obtain 12-bore guns or the necessary ammunition. Until com-
paratively recent times Peafowl were considered more or less sacred ;
this is very far from the case nowadays."
Before the war years I was persistent in appealing to phasianists
to keep their aviaries well stocked, and I was proud to know that just
prior to 1939 our aviaries in Great Britain, the United States, and
in many countries of Europe were well equipped for purposes of
breeding many rare Pheasants. Moreover, such countries as South
America, South Africa, and Australia were in course of proving that
the bird lovers of those countries were realizing that Pheasants made
a great appeal and one must admit that the countries last mentioned
will provide better facilities for rearing some of the rarer Pheasants
than the difficult climate of Great Britain.
Some ten years before the last war such Pheasants as the Satyr
Tragopan, Impeyan, the Peacock Pheasants, Brown and Blue
Grossoptilons, and other Pheasants were rarely seen in our aviaries,
but just before the war such species were by no means uncommon.
In short, at this period the Pheasant fancy had reached a high level,
and this does not refer only to the rarer species, for many a small back
garden boasted of a pair of such birds as the perky Golden Pheasant,
the aristocratic Lady Amherst or the proud disdainful Silver. Further-
more, fanciers were becoming most careful to obtain pure species,
and the hybrid Golden x Amherst were quite rightly despised.
In the year 1939 I had actually arranged for the Western Tragopan,
a species hitherto unknown in captivity, to be imported, and was

looking forward with great anticipation to seeing this Pheasant for
the first time. It was not to be, and needless to add the shipment
was cancelled.
Early in 1940 I was compelled to part with my entire collection
and although I have been in correspondence with a few of my
" Pheasant 55 friends, I am completely out of touch with the fancy,
and see no prospect of renewing my activities.
Immediately after the conclusion of hostilities I heard from my old
friend, M. Malisoux, of Namur, Belgium, and was delighted to
know that he had survived and had been able to keep most of his
breeding stock through the war. A few months later I was most
grieved to hear that owing to malnutrition he had died ; it was a
shock and inestimable loss to all phasianists. This is an opportune
moment to place on record the lasting debt that aviculturists through-
out the world owe to this indomitable phasianist. Readers of this
magazine and the O.P.S. Journal , will remember his scientific articles
on Pheasants in general, and in particular on rearing the chicks.
He overcame in a most remarkable manner diseases of all descrip-
tions, and I can state as a fact that he never failed to rear a chick
unless it was hopelessly malformed. I was in particular struck with
the truly amazing precautions he took to ward off contagion from
any disease, even that dread disease coccidiosis held no terrors for this
great aviculturist. His memory will for ever be prominent to us and
future Pheasant lovers ; apart from his scientific knowledge he was a
most loveable personality.
Dr. Derscheid, of Armendy, a keen and successful all-round avi-
culturist, suffered death for his help to escaping British airmen.
Most fortunately that great phasianist M. Delacour, as perhaps
all of my readers know, escaped from France after the capitulation
of the French army and is re-establishing his aviaries with the assist-
ance of another great aviculturist, Mr. Fooks.
One can imagine that it will be most difficult to obtain pure
specimens of the Golden and Amherst, but phasianists can do untold
good by importing from such countries as the U.S.A. The fifty pairs
of pure Lady Amherst I imported from that country in 1935 were
well distributed, and the following years showed a marked improve-
ment in British aviaries.
Owing to the food shortage the feeding of all birds during the war
has been a major problem, but it should have taught us some vital
lessons. Phasianists and aviculturists in general had to use their
ingenuity, and the results will have taught us some important facts
about Pheasant feeding. Of one thing we can be more than ever
convinced, the importance of an abundant supply of fresh green food
has been well and truly brought home. In this connection the
following is surely worth mention, although I admit that poultry

do not quite compare to Pheasants. A friend of mine has been
keeping about a dozen head of poultry during the war. He found
that the scanty and poor quality of the Government ration was not
worth bothering with. He fed his hens on the meagre scrapings from
his table, and always gave them all the green food they would eat.
Now and then he was able to secure an odd bag of chaff. He dis-
covered that the poultry kept in excellent condition (they had partial
free range), and although the hens did not reach a high standard of
laying, the eggs showed a very strong percentage of fertility. The
latter is the point that should be emphasized.
My final words must be that those phasianists who have been
fortunate enough to keep Pheasants through the war years should
surely help the would-be fanciers to start or re-stock, and I would

HOW TO REAR ORNAMENTAL PHEASANTS
By Wilford Smith
I have reared Pheasant chicks for many years in my aviaries, and
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.987835714285714" page_id="56289233"  page_num="125" year="" vol="">
have had the best results when the Pheasants have reared their own
young. If you give them a well secluded corner, not too light, they
should sit well. Do not worry if they do not come off the nest. I have
had some sit 19-20 days without leaving the nest.
Usually the Pheasant hen likes to have a dust bath (sand) after she
has hatched, when she will send the chicks away first, not like a broody
hen (poultry) ; I have had these dust bath with Pheasant chicks
underneath with ghastly results, chicks with broken legs, etc.
My experience of Pheasant hens, particularly Lady Amherst,
Golden, and Silver, is that they make exceptionally good mothers,
brood their chicks lightly, and usually have them perching when a
month old. I think the extra brooding which the chicks have under
poultry is detrimental to their health--shall we say it softens them.
They are really very hardy if fed right and kept healthy on clean
ground.
I used to re-turf my aviaries every year, and during the winter
gave them a thick litter of leaves, leaf-mould, and bracken which
kept them clean and free from mud, and also gave them plenty of
exercise scratching and pecking for grubs, etc. Each spring all litter
was cleared out for re-turfing and liming.
With the war coming I met fresh difficulties. I could not get turf,

so I left the winter litter in. That was a fateful decision, as I lost most
of my chicks with gapes.
However, the following season I cleared out all the litter and
replaced with bracken about one foot deep, just before the Pheasant
was due to hatch, and that had the desired results in so much as
keeping the chicks away from the earth. It was too strong for the
hens to scratch about, and once again I reared without gapes. Each
season since I have adopted the same procedure with good results.
Those not in a position to get bracken would find good wheat straw
give equally as good results, the only difference is that bracken seems
more of a natural floor covering for Pheasants. It is most unlikely that
you will get two Pheasant hens to agree with chicks, so if you have a
trio provide several nesting sites with a view to dividing aviary at a
later date. Sometimes Pheasant cocks are inclined to pay too much
attention to hens when sitting ; in that case remove them until they
start to moult.
Feeding is quite simple, dried crusts minced fine, soaked in milk
(just sufficient to leave it crumbly moist), with hard-boiled egg, green
food finely minced, of which I think dandelion is the best. After the
first week add cod liver oil to the biscuit meal before soaking. An
addition of canary and millet seed would be appreciated by the
chicks.

THE FUTURE OUTLOOK FOR PHEASANT
KEEPING
By G. Beever
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998141" page_id="56289234"  page_num="126" year="" vol="">
Up to the end of 1942 I had about a dozen Pheasants, consisting
of trios and pairs of Goldens, Amhersts, Reeves, and Silvers. Then,
owing to difficulties, such as lack of proper food, deterioration of wire-
netting, and most of all to the inability of giving regular attention,
I decided to part with them. I have not attempted to start a new
collection since, as there seems to be little chance of obtaining young
ones of any of the species mentioned. Judging by inquiries I have
had from Belgium and Holland, it would appear that the ornamental
types of Pheasants are practically extinct on the Continent.
When I met Mr. Delacour some months ago he told me that there
were plenty of Pheasants in the U.S.A., but the demand for young
stock is greater than the supply, therefore it would appear that there
is little chance of importing any from the U.S.A., except at a very
heavy cost. From this it seems that the fancy Pheasant will be in
short supply for some years.

G. BEEVER-THE FUTURE OUTLOOK FOR PHEASANT KEEPING I2J
No doubt as hemp seed and canary seed get more plentiful, a few
will be bred here, but scarcity of hens is the great obstacle to an
immediate increase in the population of most species of Pheasants.
The Reeves seem to be almost extinct, as after making dozens of
inquiries, I have failed to hear of a single cock Reeves.
A census of Ornamental Pheasants is being taken by Mr. G. Weaver,
for the Avicultural Society, and I should like to ask every reader who
may possess one or more Pheasants to co-operate in the scheme.
In this way the interchange of cocks and hens may lead to more
breeding pairs.
Last year Mr. G. Roote, of Leicester, managed to rear six Golden
chicks, all of which turned out to be cocks ; there may be a member
who hatched out six pullets, and the census may be the means of a
useful exchange. The same scarcity also applies to Peafowl when
inquiries are made, though there must be plenty about. The difficulty
in obtaining them is due to the difficulty of catching them up and
finding suitable baskets or crates for transport.
The greatest bugbear in connection with Pheasant keeping is the
crossing of Goldens and Amhersts. Nine out of ten people who kept
them before the war were solely interested in their beauty, and the
interbreeding of the two species did not worry them. Some people
argue that the hybrid is more beautiful than the pure-bred bird ;
in my opinion this is quite erroneous. The hybrid cock may be more
flashy, but it is certainly less beautiful and much less equal in form
and outline.
The Golden cock may be the most gorgeous bird, but the Amherst
is certainly the most shapely and aesthetic coloured bird on earth.
The only way I can think of to keep a pure stock in this country is
to import some wild-caught ones from China, and place these in the
hands of reliable Pheasant keepers who will guarantee not to cross
them. One person could have the Goldens and another the Amhersts.
I know this is easier said than done, as the importation of these birds
from China may be an impossibility for several years, owing to the
unrest in China and the transportation difficulties. One great
difficulty in keeping birds pure is the impossibility of telling by appear-
ance, a pure-bred Amherest hen from one, say, seven-eighths Amherst
and one-eighth Golden. The cocks are easier to tell, especially by
those who have long experience and owned many. The great difference
between a pure Amherst cock and one not quite pure, is the snow-
whiteness of the chest of the pure one compared with the creamy
shade of the nearly pure one. A Golden cock with the slighest trace
of Amherst blood shows it in the dark cheeks. The pure bred one
has light pink cheeks. In my opinion, ioo per cent pure Amhersts
and Goldens are not only scarce in this country but very rare. How-
ever, I hope this question of pure Goldens and Amhersts will be tackled

by someone with more time at his disposal than I have, and I hope
other Pheasant lovers will make suggestions.
The Kaleeges are also subject to hybridization, but as there are
very few species in the country except Silvers there doesn't seem to
be the same danger as with the Amhersts and Goldens.
In conclusion I should like to point out that Ornamental Pheasant
keepers will be more numerous than ever as soon as the birds are
procurable at reasonable prices, and am myself looking forward to
renewing my interest in them.

THE EARED PHEASANTS
Crossoptilon
By Jean Delagour
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.965277448275862" page_id="56289236"  page_num="128" year="" vol="">
(Reprinted from Modern Game Breeding , April, 1947)
In the course of detailed studies necessary for the preparation of a
new work on the Pheasants I have examined the Eared Pheasants
( Crossoptilon ) in 1945.
Although a great deal remains to be learned of the distribution and
variation of these birds, we nevertheless now possess useful informa-
tion which was not available twenty-seven years ago when Dr. Beebe's
Monograph of the Pheasants was published, and we can form a better
understanding of the whole group. It appears to consist of three
distinct species. Two of them are very closely related and highly
specialized, while the third one is different and more primitive.
The Blue Eared Pheasant (C. auritum) shows the highest degree of
evolution in its tail, which is normally composed of twenty-four
rectrices, of which the two central pairs have very long, disintegrated,
and widely separated webs almost to the tip. It is found in Kansu
and the neighbouring parts of Kokonor and perhaps of North-Western
Szechuan. " Interior of China " has so far been given as its type
locality, which I now proposed to restrict to Si-gu, Kansu, where
Berezowski collected specimens.
The Brown Eared Pheasant (C. mantchuricum ) inhabits northern
Shansi and north-western Chihli ; it is a little less specialized, having
only 22 rectrices, the central pair of which is also much disintegrated,
but there is a small solid patch at its tip. I restrict its type locality
to the mountains beyond San-yu, Chihli (after A. David), to replace
" vicinity of Peking ".
There is no geographical variation in these two species, and they
have completely isolated ranges on high mountains. In both the ear-
tufts consist of long and disintegrated feathers, and they project
conspicuously above the nape. The tail is much compressed and

usually held upwards, the central rectrices well above the others.
They can be considered as forming one super-species, being identical
in shape, voice, and behaviour.
The third species, C. crossoptilon , is larger ; the ear-tufts are short
and hardly show above the head, if at all. The rectrices number 20,
exceptionally 22, and are almost normal in structure, the terminal
half having no long disintegrated webs. The tail is much flatter, less
compressed, and held downwards. It certainly represents a less
specialized, more primitive type.
In life the aspect of C. crossoptilon is strikingly different from that
of the other two species, as are its voice and actions.
The geographical distribution of the species crossoptilon is still
incompletely recorded. Unlike C. mantchuricum and C. auritum , the
present species varies greatly in colour throughout its range, which
consists of the high mountains of central and south-western Szechuan,
north-western Yunnan, eastern Tibet, and southern Kokonor. In
the south-west it reaches Long. 91 0 33&apos; E. in the Tsangpo Valley, and
it does not occur south of the main Himalayan axis.
The species varies in colour from almost pure white, with black
cap and tail-tip, to a dark blue-grey.
The western Szechuan form (C. c. crossoptilon ) is white with dark
brownish-grey wings and more or less grey wash on the mantle.
The tail is mostly black, with some brownish-grey on the basal half,
green and purple reflections near the tip.
The form from eastern Tibet (C. c. drouyni ) has an almost pure white
body, a variable but always considerable amount of white or grey in
the tail, and very little grey in its wing, restricted generally to the
inner webs of the primaries. It meets and intergrades with a pale
grey form (possibly C. c. dolani ?) in the Upper Salween region. In
his book Salween , R. Kaulback reports that he found in 1936, " large
Pheasants, pure white apart from pink rings around the eyes, and a
grey patch on the top of the head " near Idashi, north of Zimda
(near 95 0 30&apos; E. Long., 31 0 20&apos; N. Lat.) and farther west and north,
between Kyierothang and Deje (94* 40&apos;E. 31 0 40&apos; N.) " both kinds
all white and pale grey with black tips to wings and tails, in mixed
flocks with between them half-bred of every shade ". A little to the
south, near Sating (94 0 40&apos;, 31 0 20&apos;), in light juniper forest, he came
across about fifty White Eared Pheasants and blood Pheasants feeding
together by the side of the path, and farther west, north of Pengar
Gompa (94 0 1 o&apos;, 31 0 20&apos;) he saw " thirty more big Pheasants mostly
of the blue variety with some half bred ".
As no specimens were collected, it is impossible to know if the
" pale grey 55 birds seen by Kaulback are dolani or some other still
undiscovered race. It seems improbable that it could be harmani ,
which is very dark indeed.

In 1935 a very distinct pale grey form, C. c. dolani was discovered
by the Dolan expedition in southern Kokonor, at Jyekundo (96* 45&apos;,
33 0 ) and at some distance to the north of the Yangtze River, It is
a very pale edition of harmani , with the feathers of the upper parts
very rough to the touch, instead of smooth and rather silky as in the
other subspecies.
C. c. harmani shows a superficial resemblance in colour to C. auritum ,
but this is purely coincidental, as the two birds differ sharply in the
shape and proportions of the tail and ear-tufts, and they are widely
separated geographically. Even in colour harmani differs from
auritum in its white belly, in a broader white band on the nape and a
white stripe down the fore-neck, in its darker, browner neck and
upper back, its much lighter lower back and rump and in the absence
of white in the tail. It is identical with C. c. crossoptilon in the structure
of tail and ear-tufts as well as in its general build. It inhabits the
south-western part of the range of the species, on the northern slopes
of the Himalayas from 91 0 33&apos; in the west in the Tsangpo Valley to
Pome, Gyale, and Pankar west of Gyamda Dzong (93 0 30&apos; E.,
30* 15&apos;N.).
Beebe has observed and recorded Eared Pheasants from North-
Eastern Yunnan, and good series have since been collected on the
Lichiang Range by Forrest and by Rock. These series are fairly
uniform, whether the birds were collected in the spring or in the
autumn ; wear affects only the white parts of the plumage, which
become ochraceous yellow by stain long after the moult. These
Lichiang birds have paler wings than C. c. crossoptilon , but they are
not as white as C. c. drouyni. I proposed for them the name of G. c.
lichiangense.
There are no doubt many intermediates between the different
races still to be recorded, and in many areas unstable populations
exist. Of the forms known and examined, crossoptilon , lichiangense ,
dolani , and harmani show little individual variation, but drouyni
(--leucurum) appears rather unstable as to the amount of white on the
rectrices and of the dark tinge on the primaries and their shafts.
Ghigi has made an interesting survey of the genetic characters of
the Eared Pheasants in studying and experimenting with hybrids.
It appears that on the one hand the long ear-tufts of auritum and
mantchuricum are dominant, while on the other hand the flat, almost
normal tail of crossoptilon is likewise dominant.
In hybrids between auritum and mantchuricum the blue colour and
clear white tail patches of the former are plainly dominant ; the
central rectrices are intermediate in structure.
Brown Eared Pheasants were first introduced into France in 1864 ;
they were soon bred in great numbers first by Melle de Bellonet, in
1866, and in 1868 and 1869 several hundred were reared. Ever

since they have been well established in Europe and later in
America.
The first Blue Eared Pheasants to arrive alive in Europe from China
were sent to my collection at Cleres in 1929 by A. Hampe, whom
I had commissioned to this effect. The following years some were
also introduced into the United States. They were soon propagated.
Both species are now common in captivity; a happy state of things
since these large Pheasants are threatened with an early extinction
in their North China home, owing to persecution and to the destruc-
tion of the forests and brush in which they live.
A few White Eared Pheasants were sent from Ta-tien-lu to London
in 1891. One pair laid eggs at the Berlin Zoo, but the species was
never bred ; only a hybrid with the Brown was reared at Antwerp,
and it now figures in the Tring collection. It has been studied by
Ghigi.
In 1936 several pairs of the Szechuan race (C. c. crossoptilon) were
received in California by Mr. W. Leland Smith, who succeeded in
rearing several in 1938 and the following years. There is now a fair
number of these fine birds in the United States. Mr. Claude Hooke,
in California, reared 23 in 1946.

Thanks to the great generosity of Mr. Spedan Lewis, my aviaries
are not completely empty this season.
Last summer I received from Leckford a beautiful pair of adult
Temminck's Tragopans, which have never given me a moment's
anxiety, although they must have felt the change in diet to ordinary
chicken biscuit meal, together with boiled potato, some greens, and
an apple most days. I have noticed that most Tragopans appear
to prefer stinging nettles to any other form of greenstuff.
Our Arctic winter troubled them not at all, though it must be
admitted that unlike many other Pheasants they roosted inside their
shelter instead of choosing the highest and most exposed perch in
the outer flight. When the calendar tried to make us believe that spring
was with us, the male began to display by blowing out his horns and
bib. This was the sign for the provision of a nest, a small hamper
lined with damp turfs and hay, fixed about five feet from the ground.

A friend who knows much more than I do, said it was a good plan
also to put in some dead leaves, but my hen " Trag" removed every
single leaf before laying her first egg, also a good deal of fouling of
the nest was cleaned up and removed at the same time, and thereby
hangs my tale. The hen had been sitting a few days when the cock
was seen to fly on to the edge of the nest and make a few clucking
noises ; the hen replied by a few sounds which the man in the street
would not understand, so far the sake of those who do not understand
Pheasant language I will translate the conversation.
" Now, my dear, 53 said the cock, " it is high time you went for a
walk and powdered your nose. I do declare you do get your nest
into a dreadful mess. 55
44 Oh, for goodness sake don&apos;t nag, 55 answered the lady. 44 In these
days of labour shortage, you might at least do a little housework,
for you neither lay eggs nor sit on them. I suppose you think it's
enough to blow yourself out and think you look wonderful. 55
What actually happened was that the hen, when addressed by her
mate, promptly left the nest, and began to feed, while he very carefully
removed any droppings from the edge of the nest. This done, a few
more clucks to the hen, and she flew back and settled down on her
eggs.
As a fact I have now put the eggs under a light hen ; for although
Tragopans are usually very good mothers, such is my acquisitiveness
that I should like a second clutch.
I don't know whether the behaviour of my cock is unusual or not ;
we all know that most perching birds remove the voidings of their
young from the nest's edge, but I have never known a male look
after his spouse in this way.

By Geo. Hampden Edwards
My hard-won Pheasant collection, mainly the more common (or
erstwhile common !) Pheasants, was, I think, the greatest source oi
pleasure I ever found in all my avicultural loves. You know how it
all begins ; the normal bird-love that most children feel, then the
first childhood expedition into the fringe of aviculture proper, with
perhaps a young Thrush or Blackbird, which likely enough did not
survive those early well-intentioned offerings of bread, milk, and a
surfeit of worms (followed by a famine of the like, for children can be
very forgetful). You will know, too, how one graduates to keeping
the rarer British species, and later the feverish and indiscriminating
collection of foreign birds, especially the Waxbills. And then, as the
fever subsides--not before many of the ill-considered purchases have
died--a more steady and intelligent court is paid to the Lady Avis.
For, as the poet Edgar Guest said (though he did not have birds in
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.5826645" page_id="56289241"  page_num="133" year="" vol="">
mind)--
" Although my heart in earlier youth
Might kindle with more wild desire . . .
. . . The flame now warms my inmost core
That then but sparkled o'er my brow--
And though I seemed to love you more
Yet O, I love you even better now."
So it was that my bird-keeping was brought to reasonable bounds,
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.998939684210526" page_id="56289241"  page_num="133" year="" vol="">
and all new purchases first considered very carefully. But my first
acquaintance with the ornamental Pheasants caused a relapse, and
a new fever burned. Fortunately, Pheasants were not on the market
at a few shillings each, as were so many kinds of foreign birds, but
I did eventually have a nice collection . . .
It was not possible to keep birds during the past years, and when
it did seem ripe to try and begin anew Pheasants were scarce, and
expensive--not unnaturally, as those who did keep Pheasants through
the war years kept them with great difficulty and at no small cost ;
and Pheasant lovers owe them a debt of gratitude.
But a Pheasant lover did not need to despair, for covert Pheasant
eggs were available, and even if they would not contribute to bringing
ornamental Pheasants, there was the pleasure of rearing them from
long-legged p ecocious chicks to fat and prosperous-looking poults ;
and later to see the cocks slowly shed their brown feathers, replacing
them one by one with glowing buds of colour till at last the final
pattern emerges in the brilliance and design that is the miracle and
the glory of all the Pheasants.
The Pheasant chicks were confined to runs at first, and later given

free range, but when the time came that they began to roam far
afield, a few were confined to an aviary. The others continued to
return each evening for some time, but when the corn was yellow
and heavy, and the plentiful berries were ripe, fewer returned, and
finally they all stayed away. This was not an end to my pleasure, for
often in some farmer's field of stubble I would see a Pheasant hen
run and crouch, or a cock bird rise hurriedly and glide away down
the glen.
Some of the birds I reared and freed might have returned for food
when the frosts came, nested wild the following Spring, or at least
have provided in time a sporting shot for a bona fide sportsman.
But there are, even in this remote part of Wales, too many to whom
a Pheasant means a feed, or a few shillings from a sale, and therefore
something to be caught by any means and method.
While on this subject, shooting is no sport of mine, albeit I like the
genuine sportsman, for he is all that the name implies, and he stocks
as well as shoots ; is knowledgeable and interested in wild life, and
kills with discrimination.
But there are too many trigger-happy fools abroad. As witness, on
hearing a loud report, obviously over my own place, I went to investi-
gate, and found a man who had apparently been given permission to
shoot over the adjoining ground. A few of my fowls were among the
small piece of oats I was growing, and as the man approached, he said :
" I'm sorry if this is your ground. I saw something move in the
corn, and thought it was a Pheasant. I saw it was a hen after I shot,
but," he went on cheerfully, " I missed, so it's all right." My rejoinder
had not sufficient merit for reporting.
In parenthesis, I wonder how long the powers that be will allow
guns to be carried by anyone who buys a licence, without testing for
normal intelligence, and seeing that the applicant can at least identify
a proportion of birds and animals from illustrations shown him ?
The Pheasants I write of were supposed to be the Old English
Blacknecks ( Phasianus colchicus colchicus ) but were not uniform, and
I suppose it will become increasingly difficult to find Blacknecks that
are really pure. Some showed obvious foreign blood in a few traces
of white about their necks, but even the regular marked were not
uniform in several respects.
The so-called True Pheasants ( Phasianus ) in my experience are
like none other of the Pheasants in their reaction to captivity. While
the Golden ( Chrysolophus pictus ) and the Amherst (C. amherslice)
especially will fly wildly about if alarmed, at least it is possible to
recognize the cause for alarm--a strange person or dog, or even
their attendant because differently dressed than usual. But P. colchicus,
though becoming apparently as tame as any, will sometimes take
fright for no apparent reason at all. Not so much the hens ; it is the

cock birds that so suddenly and inexplicably take fright and fly up
at the net with terrified madness.
Hens that have got free have returned and have suffered themselves
to be driven into the aviary, but a cock that broke free through the
faulty net, though he returned to the yard at dawn and dusk, would
race away like a greyhound at the first glimpse of me. And this
was a bird that fed from my hand, and would sometimes perch on my
knee, and had known me for two years !
Yet, though they will not domesticate and seem inherently distrustful
of humans, apart from the superficial tameness they show to their
attendant, there is something about their wild spirit that touches a
sympathetic cord within us. Pleasing to watch in an aviary, they are
fascinating to see when wild.
I particularly recollect the grand sight of a Ringneck (P. c. mongolicus)
as it appeared through my binoculars very early one morning some
few years ago. The first rays of the rising sun caught it as it stood
erect on the green carpet of a hayfield's aftermath ; there was a
silvery blur from his wing-whir, and then the challenging crow.
Highly alert yet arrogant, he strode along until he was distracted
by something in the grass, when he began jumping about excitedly.
I saw he had a mouse, which he pecked and savaged for a long time
before he swallowed it ; and, judging from the wry neck movements,
its passage gave him a deal of trouble.
Mice may not often be taken by Phasianus , but one Silver cock
(Gennaus nycthemems ) I once possessed seemed to like nothing better.
He was a surly old bird, rough with his wives, and ever ready to jump
and strike at me when I entered the aviary. He disliked the Fantail
Pigeons too, but was indifferent to the small Finches. The seed the
Finches scattered brought mice, and the sight of a mouse brought a
gleam to the eyes of the old Silver, and when it was near enough a
sharp thrust of the beak captured it, and it was hammered on the
floor and eaten.
Perhaps the birds which delighted me most were a pair of Elliot
Pheasants ( Syrmaticus ellioti ), to some extent because of sentiment,
in the manner in which I became possessed of them as well as for
their own intrinsic worth. Male and female are colourful, and I
regard them as splendid and very desirable aviary birds.
I lost the Elliots through--so a post mortem report said--avian T.B.,
and so Pheasant keeping, with its quota of mishaps, is not all joy.
But that is so of any livestock hobby.
Pheasants, including the " covert " or game Pheasants, are eminently
satisfying for those who care for colour and form, beauty and grace,
and tameness that has to be won. In some species the tameness
is entire and fearless ; in others, such as my friend P. c. colchicus, it is
an uncertain quality that can evaporate after an hour of freedom.

By G. Beever
During the early Autumn of 1941, I was reading the local evening
paper when I came across an advertisement : " Found, a Chinese
Pheasant."
I immediately made a bee-line to the address given, which was
a part of the town occupied by textile factories, and the last place
in the world one would expect to find a Pheasant. I was certain
it would not be a wild Pheasant, so I concluded it must be one of the
ornamental species. However, I arrived at the house, which was in
a congested area, and wondered how a Pheasant could be found at
such a place. The advertiser, a local textile worker, told me that
the bird had flown through a greenhouse window at an allotment ;
then I thought, well it cannot be a Golden or an Amherst, as they
are so light in weight that such a performance would kill them. He
then gave me the description, and I came to the conclusion that it
must be an Amherst cock. Being certain that I knew everybody within
five miles of Huddersfield who kept Pheasants, I couldn't imagine
even after the description that it really could be an Amherst, because
I was certain there were none except my own in the district.
The finder then accompanied me to the allotment, which was a
small open space surrounded by houses and factories. He had put
it in a small scratching shed, attached to his poultry house. Yes,
it was a real Amherst cock, in magnificent condition. I offered him
a price for it in case it was not claimed. In a week's time he wrote
me to say no one had claimed, and I could have it.
Now, the puzzle is, where did it come from, and how did it fly
through a window without even hurting itself.
About the same time of the previous incident, one of my Golden
Cocks escaped, and mysteriously disappeared. Two weeks after
a friend of mine rang me up to ask if I had lost a Pheasant. I said
yes, where is it. He told me it was in a tunnel which went under
the road near my aviaries. This tunnel, about thirty yards long, had
a water channel down the centre, but had been bagged up at each
end to make an air-raid shelter. I never dreamt of looking in there,
as my experience of Pheasants is that they will not go into dark
enclosed places, and generally prefer sleeping out in the open part
of the aviary. I went straight to the tunnel, and found the cock
there alive and in good condition, perched on the edge of the water
channel. From previous experiences it confirmed the fact that
Pheasants can go a long time without food. This, however, is not
the most extraordinary part of the story. The person who first

found the bird in the tunnel was a factory inspector, who had been
sent round to inspect air-raid shelters, and just happened to be staying
with my friend, who knew I kept Pheasants. If he had stayed any-
where else, I should have never heard about the bird again.

PHEASANTS AT LIBERTY

One of the commonest disadvantages in the housing of Ornamental
Pheasants is that the birds are generally too large to look well in the
aviary in which they are kept. They have also the distressing habit
of running up and down their aviaries looking for a hole in the netting,
till they spoil their tails ; this is especially true of such long-tailed
species as Reeves. Pheasants can, however, be kept very well at liberty
either pinioned or full-winged, when conditions are suitable for them.
The essentials are : (1) A reasonable amount of cover, such as is
given by shrubberies ; (2) That their domain is not on the edge of a
large wooded area through which they may stray ; (3) Freedom from
foxes, dogs, and, to a much lesser extent, cats.
The house here stands in a wooded bankside, surrounded largely
by open country for a distance of perhaps half a mile before there is
any real wood or plantation. The garden contains a fair amount of
rough grass, a bit of brambly wood and shrubberies, and here the
birds stay and breed very well.
Amherst are particularly suitable. They are not powerful flyers,
and appear to be absolutely harmless in a garden. Unfortunately
one cannot keep more than one such bird, as they fight so terribly
amongst themselves. They, however, ignore and are ignored by the
common Pheasants, which abound here, and the Reeves when we
had them at liberty. The hens successfully reared their young,
finding all their food, but the young cocks were invariably driven off
the place or killed by their father if they refused to go. During
the winter and spring they came regularly on to the lawn in front
of the house for bread or bits of scraps, and at liberty are much
less nervous than when in aviaries.
Reeves--we kept several pinioned hens and a full-winged cock, a
magnificent and powerful flyer ; again, as in the case of the Amherst,
the young males were driven off, and some took their sisters with them.
Silvers are supposed to stay well--we have not kept them--but have
a reputation for being extremely savage and for driving away other
Pheasants. What applies to Silvers will undoubtedly be true of

Edwards, a very charming aviary bird, but its dark metallic blues
would not render it a very conspicuous liberty bird.
Some day I hope to try a pair of Tragopans at liberty, as I think
they should be most attractive if they will stay. It would be very
pleasant to see the hen sitting on her nest perched up in some thorn
bush in the garden. Our aviary birds have on several occasions
ignored our nest boxes and built their own nests, which are quite
substantial affairs.
The only other species we have at liberty is the Blue Grossoptilon,
and it is easily the most sedentary. Our birds never stray even
a short distance from their chosen home. They are very fowl-
like in their extreme docility and lack of that inborn nervousness
so common to all the game birds. Another pleasant thing is
that the males get on quite reasonably well with each other ;
the various members generally go about in a party, and even
in the breeding season they get on reasonably well together. They
are, however, bad gardeners, as they dig a good deal with their powerful
beaks. They are, as I have already said, extremely sedentary and rarely
stray. Our birds here have only a low bridge between their paddock
and the kitchen garden, into which as far as I know they never have
been. Before the war we had two pairs in an old orchard surrounded
by a six-foot fence to keep in Cranes and Rheas. These birds hardly
ever came over that fence, and when they did it was generally in
coming down from their roosts high up in an old walnut. Incidentally,
they seem to prefer high and reasonably exposed roosting places.
If anyone wishes to start, say, a few Amhersts in a garden, the safest
thing is to keep the birds in an enclosure, and after a few weeks to
let the male bird out quietly without scaring him or the hens, and
after he has learnt his way about to free the hens.
Our Amhersts were caught up last year in order that we might
rear a bigger number, and it is curious how much shyer the birds
are now they are confined.

Members of the Club, 27 ; guests, 7 ; total, 34.
Mr. Seth-Smith showed a very interesting selection from his
extensive collection of slides. The majority were of birds at the
London Zoo and Whipsnade, but some had been taken at Foxwarren
Park and Falloden. Many of the slides were of Geese and Ducks--
the latter including one of tame Mandarins being fed by the late
Lord Grey ; others showed the display of the Argus Pheasant--the
first photographs taken--Kagus, Crested Screamers, Cariamas, etc.
Miss Knobel then showed some sixty beautiful hand-coloured
slides made by her father, the late Dr. E. B. Knobel. While not of
avicultural interest it was thought that owing to their unique nature
they would prove of interest to members. The slides were divided
into three groups : Scenes in the Lake District, views of places of
beauty and interest in Europe, and woods and commons of
Surrey. The artistic skill embodied in these slides was such that
they compared very favourably with the best natural colour photo-
graphy.
Mr. Tom Goodwin, recently returned from a collecting trip with
Mr. Andrew Wilson to Kenya, gave a graphic account of some of
their experiences in search of wild animals and birds. Members were
given a fair idea of the expense and difficulties of such an undertaking.

Trail of the Money Bird. By Dillon Ripley. 1947. Longmans,
Green. 155-.
Dr. Ripley was commissioned by the Academy of Natural Sciences
in Philadelphia to collect specimens of exotic birds. Leaving Phila-
delphia in December, 1936, he spent eighteen months in travelling,
first with the Denison-Crockett Expedition sailing a 59-foot schooner
through the Panama Canal and the South Seas, calling at the
Galapagos Islands, Tahiti, Samoa, Fiji Islands, and the Solomons,
to New Guinea ; and then returning by steamer via Singapore and
Suez. The latter part of the journey has been described briefly in
A.M. , 1938, 267. In all, over 30,000 miles were covered.
Dr. Ripley writes in a friendly, almost conversational, manner
that makes very pleasurable reading. Consequently, this is not just
another travel book, nor a glorified catalogue of the birds seen or
collected, but an adventure narrative interspersed with interesting
observations on the birds encountered. It is perhaps a little dis-
appointing from an ornithologist's point of view in that so many of
the birds mentioned are not definitely identified. It is not particularly
satisfying to read, for instance, that specimens of " a large long-tailed
bird (Parrot) with a big crimson bill " and a Starling with " a rather
long tail and bright shiny greenish plumage " were obtained. It is
to be hoped that in any future edition, Dr. Ripley will give a list of
the specimens, living and skins, collected.
The book is well illustrated with photographs taken during the
expedition, and New York Zoological Society plates of Birds of
Paradise. There is also a very interesting photograph of a Bower-
Bird's playhouse. The title ? On p. 223 we read that the Malays
describe the King Bird of Paradise as the " Money Bird

Additions to the London Zoo
February, 1947. There were but six new arrivals during the month. The most
interesting were a Fraser's Eagle Owl (Bubo poensis) from Nigeria, presented by
D. S. Cowan ; and a Blue-throated Brown Sunbird (Cyanomitra cyanolama ) from
the Gold Coast, deposited.
March, 1947. Twenty-nine birds were received during the month. There was
nothing of importance except a pair of Stanley Cranes ( Tetrasteryx paradisea ) received
in exchange. The Whipsnade additions number forty-six, but the majority of these
were transferences from Regent's Park. Pheasant breeders will be interested to
note that there were 2 Reeve's, $ ; 2 Elliot's ; 4 Swinhoe's, # $ $ ; 4 Edward's,

There were also eighteen Goldfinches ( Carduelis carduelis hritannica) and two Wax-
wings ( Bombycilla garrulus).
A Booted Eagle ( Hieraaetus pennatus) from the Gold Coast was presented by-
Mr. B. J. Shaw, otherwise the only noteworthy foreigner was a Rock-hopper Penguin
( Eudyptes crestatus ) from the Falkland Islands.
May, 1947. The registered additions for the month were eighty. Twenty-four
King Penguins ( Aptenodytes patagonica ) were received from the Government (?) of
South Georgia. They are at present in the Waders' Aviary, and are well worth a
visit. Two Ringed Penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica ) from South Georgia were deposited.
This is a species new to the collection. There were many other important new-
comers, including two White Pelicans ( Pelicanus onocrotalus) , nine Greater Flamingoes
(Phanicopterus antiquorum ), six Whooper Swans ( Cygnus cygnus ), two Black Swans
( Chenopis atrata ), one Semipalmated Goose ( Anseranus semipalmaia) , one Marabau
Stork ( Leptoptilus crumeniferus) , one Eastern Sarus Crane ( Grus antigone), nine
Demoiselle Cranes ( Anthropoides virgo), three Grey-necked Crowned Cranes
(Balearica regulorum), and four Ostriches ( Struthio camelus ). The majority of all the
last-named have been transferred to Whipsnade.

The 13TH International Zoological Congress. Paris, 1948.
The 13th International Zoological Congress will be held in Paris in 1948, on
Wednesday, 21st July to Tuesday, 27th July.
Correspondence should be addressed to the Secretary-General, Professor M.
Fischer-Piette, at the Museum, 55 Rue de Buffon, Paris 5 e , or so far as concerns
the sections to the Presidents of the various sections.
A detailed programme will be forwarded in due course.
The subscription is 1,000 French francs. Those taking part who have already
paid a subscription of 200 francs in 1939 (when the Congress was fixed for 1940),
will pay the difference, namely 800 francs. Subscriptions should be addressed to
the Treasurer of the 13th International Zoological Congress, 61 rue de Buffon, at
Paris V e (CCP. no. 675-33 Paris).
Those wishing to become members of the Congress should write to the Secretary-
General, giving all the necessary information, surname, Christian names, date of
birth, address, profession, and title, and the section in which it is desired to participate.
Membership will not be recognized until the subscription has been paid.
The Congress will be followed by excursions. It is proposed to make an excursion
to the Laboratories of Brittany (Dinard, Roscoff, Concarneau), and return by the
Chateaux de la Loire ; and an excursion to the Inland Laboratories (Saint-Jean-de-
Losne, Grenoble, Besse) as well as the Marine Laboratories at Villefranche. This
excursion will go by the route over the Alps, and will visit the Cote d'Azur.
The object of the International Zoological Congresses has been to promote personal
contacts between zoologists and general discussions of the problems of zoology ;
the executive committee of the 13 th Congress has decided to expend every effort to
this end, and has been led to take the following decisions both for order and simplifica-
tion, which are more necessary than ever at the present time.
The Congress will consist of general and sectional meetings. The general meetings
will be reserved for the discussion of general questions placed on the agenda by the
Executive Committee. These discussions will be based on the reports of which a
resume of four pages (about 1,600 words) will previously be printed and distributed
at the opening of the Congress.
All the members may send proposals to the Executive Committee relative to the
questions which they wish to hear discussed, and can suggest at the same time the
name of a speaker. The sectional meetings will be devoted to--
(1) The discussion of special questions of immediate interest to the section, and
put on the agenda by the Executive Committee. These discussions will take place
either in the form of symposia, or the basis of a special report, according to the possi-
bilities which offer themselves to the President of the section.
(2) The exhibition of communications including as far as possible demonstrations
(animals, anatomical sections, photographs, illustrations, etc.). It is above all by
the presentation of studied documents that these communications have their place
in the Congress.

The reports on the items on the agenda of the sections will also be printed and
distributed before the Congress in the same way as those of the general meetings ;
as to the particular communications, a resume will also be published not exceeding
400 words. The Executive Committee insists on the necessity of rendering dis-
cussions most fruitful, which will usually be carried on in several languages, by the
printing and previous distribution of the reports and resumes. The authors ar
therefore asked to deliver them in good time, so that this can be carried out.
The President's Garden Party, 1947.
On the 31st May, some eighty members and friends visited Foxwarren Park at
the kind invitation of Mr. and Mrs. Ezra. The weather was perfect, being one of
the hottest days of the fine spell. While the heat lessened the activity of many of the
visitors, forcing them to seek the shade, Mr. Ezra himself was indefatigable in con-
ducting parties round the aviaries, waterfowl enclosure, wallaby and deer paddocks,
etc. It was some years since most of us last visited Foxwarren and to those who
remembered the past glories of the former collection--one of the finest private
collections in the world--the sight of so many almost untenanted aviaries was very
saddening. Shearing is still in charge and the general condition of the collection is
a tribute to the care and attention he has given it.
After tea Captain Delacour made the presentation to Miss Knobel already
described in the last number of the Avicultural Magazine. It was a most pleasant
party and grand reunion of members. A. A. P.

FIRST INTRODUCTION OF THE BLUE CROSSOPTILON

<bodyText confidence="0.992338852941177" page_id="56289250"  page_num="142" year="" vol="">
Having again access to our Magazine after six years' interruption, I have read
with great interest and pleasure the different articles, and am very glad that the
Magazine has kept up its splendid standard during those difficult years of the war.
May I, however, draw the attention of our members, and especially of those who
are interested in Pheasants, to the following.
In the September/October copy, 1943, Mr. Delacour gives an account of the various
introductions of new Pheasants to Europe, and says that Mr. Floyd-Smith sent him
some Blue Eared Pheasants in 1931, from Szechuen. To my surprise and regret he
does not mention that it was I myself who, after twenty-four years of endeavour and
considerable outlay, succeeded in getting the first lot of this Pheasant direct from
Kansu in August, 1929, of which about 18 or 20 reached Cleres safely in the same
year. The second lot of Blue Crossoptilons which the late Mr. Floyd-Smith brought
to California in 1932, were also imported from Kansu at my instigation. Floyd-
Smith collected skins for the Museum in Chicago in Western China. During one of
his returns to Shanghai from up-country, I met him in the race club, and in the
course of our conversation I suggested to him to bring live birds and animals, and
told him how I had got the Blue Eared Pheasants.
He then sent his Chinese to Kansu who brought about thirty-five Blue Ears to
Shanghai in 1932. They arrived in very bad condition and were deposited in the
small zoological garden of Shanghai in Jessfield Park. Placed in a big aviary they
quickly improved, and in November, 1932, I was able to pack, as far as I remember,
fourteen pairs and eight single cocks, as well as two pairs of Temminck's Tragopans.
I caught and packed them all personally, and I remember that it was a very hot job
on a warm November afternoon, for the Crossoptilons as a rule such quiet and tame
birds, got very excited, and moved in the roomy aviary like greased lightning. They
travelled in the personal care of Floyd-Smith to California, and all arrived safely,
as well as the Temminck's Tragopans and two Catbears.
Mr. Floyd-Smith died some years ago, and I myself, much to my regret, cannot
undertake another trip to the Far East, but I hope that an able collector will one
day proceed to Western China and bring back the rare feathered denizens of far-off
China, which will certainly be a delight for all bird lovers.

Mr. Delacour mentions that Mr. Hampe was the first to send him Blue Eared
Pheasants in his article which was published in Modern Game Breeding , April, 1947,
and which is reprinted in this number of the Avicultural Magazine (see page 131).
No doubt the omission to mention that Mr. Hampe was the first to secure Blue Eared
Pheasants for Europe in the article written by Mr. Delacour in 1943 was an over-

THE NESTING HABITS OF CORTLLIS GALGULUS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990543377777778" page_id="56289251"  page_num="143" year="" vol="">
In my recent notes on the nesting habits of Agapornis and Coryllis ( A.M. , 1947, 22),
I unaccountably omitted to mention a very interesting description of an unsuccessful
breeding attempt by a pair of Blue-crowned Hanging Parrakeets ( Coryllis galgulus)
in an aviary in India. This is by far the fullest account, and I quote it at some
length. Major G. A. Perreau writes in Bird Notes , 1908-9, 276 :--
" In October, 1906, the hen showed great anxiety to nest, but neither of the cocks
was at all willing ; the two elder ones did not survive till the following October, but
the younger one, in spite of his want of full dress, succumbed to the attractions and
attentions of the old lady. Unfortunately he took so long to make up his mind that
I had not the pleasure of even seeing eggs before my departure for England broke up
their housekeeping. The old lady, too, could not make up her mind as to the best
nesting site ; she seemed to covet logs in the next aviary. Her special desire was for
one occupied by Madagascar Lovebirds. She had similar (not to mention better)
ones in her own enclosure, but the other was occupied, and she and a hen Blue-wing
spent much time shrieking at the Madagascars.
The display was more quaint and interesting than beautiful, bar the preliminary
showing-off flights, which were all the more appreciated as they seldom fly much.
He would stand unnaturally erect, head and eyes straight to the front, head slightly
drawn back, throat puffed out in the most extraordinary way, beak depressed almost
out of sight in the throat bladder, so as to show off the top of the head, beak often
dripping in an even more disgusting way than usual with Parrots, soiling his bib,
but the hen soon saw to that. All the time he sang, a horrid noise to human ears, but
fortunately low. Even the hen could not stand it for long, but then she was anxious
to be fed.
She was very keen on house hunting, and explored more than I liked. One
Gouldian cock on eggs got a broken beak and had to be dispatched, but that casualty
was put down (rightly, I think) to an evil-tempered Blue-wing who could not, or
would not lay eggs, though she sat steadily for weeks at a time. Still nesting Parrakeets
and Finches are best kept apart if it can be managed.
She had a most curious habit of carrying small chips tucked in among the upper
breast feathers. I might almost say the lower throat feathers as she liked to get
them in as high up as possible, going through curious contortions to get them there.
My Blue-winged and Madagascar hens did the same (but that is another story).
I cannot say for certain which species started it, but the Hanger was the first to be
seen at the game. Her unusual position on the ground away from the seed trays
first attracted my attention, and I saw her tucking away small bark chips (gnawed
off by larger Parrakeets). Afterwards I saw her carrying off all sorts of odds and
ends, hemp and canary husks, small bits of stems, and petals of flowers, flakes of
cuttle fish, all small. Lots (apparently all) fell out at once, but inspection of her
nest-boxes showed that she did get a good lot of rubbish into them. She showed
no inclination to sit steadily even when I restrained my curiosity to give her no excuse
for shifting her quarters."
Not the least interesting part of the foregoing is the observation that the Blue-
winged Parrotlet carried, or attempted to carry, nesting material tucked amongst her
feathers. This is the only record of this habit in the genus Forpus I have seen."

CORRESPONDENCE
BREEDING THE RED-FACED LOVEBIRD, A. PULLARIUS (L.)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988109178571429" page_id="56289252"  page_num="144" year="" vol="">
In his article " Breeding Records to Date " of copy May-June, 1941, Dr. Hopkinson
refers to a correspondence which took place between him, my late namesake, Helmut
Hampe, and myself. There occurred, however, several slight mistakes which I should
like to put right. Firstly I am still alive, and live in Konigsberg, East Prussia, not
in Berlin as stated ; it was Mr. Helmut Hampe who died in the beginning of the
war. He was no relation of mine, and to my regret I never made his acquaintance.
Now to the breeding of the Red-faced Lovebird. I had informed Dr. Hopkinson
that this Lovebird had been bred with full success by Eduard Spille, of Oldenburg.
Later on, Dr. Hopkinson received a postcard from a Mr. Boss or Voss, Berlin, stating
that Spille had not bred Agapornis pullarius, that he had made a mistake, and that
his birds were Peachfaced Lovebirds ( roseicollis ) and not pullaria. After a good deal
of hunting I have found the correct address of Spille, and have written to him on
the subject, but to my regret I received a letter from Mrs. Spille informing me that
Mr. Spille had died in 1945, and that she herself could not answer my question.
I have, however, found two letters of Mr. Spille to a Mr. Krabbe and Dr. Duncker,
published in copy No. 3 of Voegel ferner Laender (birds of foreign countries) of which
of one of them I give a translation herewith, which clearly proves that Mr. Spille has
indeed bred Agapornis pullarius, and that he has made no mistake between this kind
and A. roseicollis. The letter reads as follows :--
Dear Mr. Krabbe,
In reply to your letter, I beg to inform you that I have made no mistake about
the breeding of Agapornis pullarius. At that time I had only this one pair besides
Budgerigars, Redrumps, Kings, Rosellas, and Madagascars. I kept them almost
two years, together with these different Parakeets. They and also another pair
I had before got on quite well with all these birds, there were no serious squabbles,
only when the young Budgerigars became too cheeky, the Pullaria showed them
their beaks. Now and then the Pullaria carried a little straw into the nesting
box and the hen remained often for four to five days in the box, but that was all.
After about two years when going through the nesting boxes I was agreeably
surprised to find two fully feathered chicks and a clear egg. The old hen was also
in the box, and flew away when I looked in. As I had never thought that the
Pullaris would nest, I had not examined this special box. After leaving the nest
the chicks were still fed by the parents for about 8-10 days, but then these persecuted
them so badly that I gave the young ones away. Six weeks later I noticed the old
pair again carrying nesting material, and now much more eagerly than before.
They stopped, however, at once when they noticed me, and altogether they behaved
very secretly. The time until hatching was 20 days. Twice four eggs were laid.
The chicks were fed with white millet, canary seed, oats, biscuits, fresh ants' eggs,
and a lot of chickweed. With this food they grew very rapidly. If I am not
mistaken, they left the nest on the 30th or 32nd day after hatching. Three young
ones grew up, one egg was clear. To my regret I parted with the young birds, then
my old hen died suddenly, and although I tried hard, I could not replace her.
For several years no Pullaria were in the market. Later on also the old cock died.
He had several times tried to pair with a Madagascar hen, but had no success.
Etc., etc. . . .
(Signed) Ed. Spille.
Oldenburg, 13th March, 1323.
A second letter of Mr. Spille addressed to Dr. H. Duncker, of Bremen, dated
13th March, 1929, reads to the same effect. In this letter, Mr. Spille emphasizes
once more that he has made no mistake, that he has bred Roseicollis before, and
that he knows the two kinds perfectly well.
These two letters of Mr. Spille can therefore be considered as a clear proof of the
absolute validity of the record of breeding Agapornis pullarius.

(Continued from p. 12 , Jan-Feb. No., 1947 .)
Translated and reprinted from Notes Avicoles et Ornithologiques, Edities par Aviornis,
by permission of the Editor. (This article was written by the late Dr. Derscheid
during his imprisonment in Brussels.)
Feeding
Except in the case of rare species, the problem of feeding the
Limicola in captivity is not difficult or onerous. The essential points
are to introduce the necessary or desirable modifications in their
diet very gradually, to see that the food is always perfectly fresh, and
that the receptacles in which it is placed are scrupulously clean.
At the time of their reception these birds, which are generally
recently captured, are not used to an artificial diet and it is almost
always essential to feed them at first with live food, for instance insects
(mealworms, fresh ant eggs, grasshoppers, flies, cockroaches) and
other small creatures--earthworms, mud-worms (larva of Chironomus ,
which can be procured almost all the year round from fishing gear
suppliers and shops that sell fish for aquaria), tadpoles, etc. Even
after a few days, particularly if the specimens are in company with
other birds already accustomed to aviary life, one can introduce into
their diet dried ants' eggs, dried shrimps, dried daphnia, or water
fleas, all of which they will accept with eagerness. The succeeding
stage consists of including in the menu chopped dry yolk of egg and
raw lean meat, cut into short, fine strips proportional to the size of the
consumers. One can soon replace the foodstuffs mentioned above,
wholly or partially, by hard-boiled egg and small pieces of meat.
Finally, the last step towards the perfected menu is the introduction

of starchy foods in the mixture. The best are fine biscuit (almost re-
duced to powder and well mixed with the yolk of hard-boiled egg) and
mashed, boiled potatoes, and one can advantageously introduce some
good paste for insectivorous birds such as is sold in packets. The food
at this final stage could be described as being composed of two parts of
boiled potatoes, one part of hard yolk of egg, one part of insectivorous
paste, and half part of dried ants' eggs or dried flies, the whole given
twice a day in a homogeneous mass in flat dishes. Three or four
times a week some raw meat is added and some mealworms thrown
daily on the floor of the aviary, form a sort of dessert and also increases
the tameness of your birds.
It is not a bad thing to replace the potatoes in the mixture on certain
days by an equal quantity of finely crumbled breadcrumbs. In addition
we have had good results by replacing the insectivorous paste by a
certain proportion of meat meal, fish meal, and of ground hemp seed.
It is equally advisable to add to the daily ration some drops of cod-
liver oil or of Vigantol, and a little kitchen salt. The birds should
always be provided with fine gravel and crushed oyster shell or a
cuttlefish bone.
Certain Limicola , Lapwings for example, are also to be tempted by
a few seeds (millet, rye, husked oats, hemp), and there is no harm in
giving this to them if one always remembers to regard it as an accessory,
the paste forming the base of their main food.
The Choice of Subjects.--The Small Indigenous Limicola.
When it is a case of stocking large aviaries it is without doubt pre-
ferable that the aviculturist should resort in part at least to the showy
species which are effective even at a distance, that is to say, waders of
moderate or large size, or exotic species whose plumage is of bright
colours or more striking contrasts than most of the European Limicola.
On the other hand, for those who have only aviaries of modest
dimensions I cannot advise anything better than to give preference to
the little waders of the shore which visit our country on migration, or
which are more or less residents in the low-lying parts of our country.
These have given me personally the most satisfaction and the least
trouble by loss.
The small indigenous species enumerated below, all easy to keep,
seem to me to be particularly commendable, above all for the amateur
aviculturist. They live in perfect health and in complete accord if
placed together ; if they are kept in couples they are contented in
small aviaries of, for example, 2 metres by 4 metres, of which a third
or a quarter is taken up by the pool.
The Plovers are charming little birds, always alert in manner and
confiding in their habits. The most beautiful and the easiest to buy on
the market is the Ringed Plover (Charadrius hiaticula) characterized by

a large black unbroken band round the neck and across the chest,
yellow-orange feet, and an orange beak with a black tip ; the black
parts are less extensive and less intense on the female, the size is about
that of the Sparrow. Their movement across the wet sand (this
bird does not appear actually to put its feed in water) is made in little
jerky bounds as if the bird was progressing in an intermittent manner
on roller skates. The eyes are relatively large, which is in keeping with
the habits of this species, which is mostly active at twilight or during
the night. I have always, on beautiful summer nights, listened with
pleasure to the Plovers breaking the silence with their soft call, fluting
and plaintive-- tou-it! tou-it! Two other Plovers, neighbours of the
above, may be mentioned--the Kentish Plover, which has a broken
band or collar ( Charadrius alexandrinus) , further recognizable by its

dark cap, its entirely black beak, and black feet, and the Little
Ringed Plover ( Charadrius dubius curonicus), of smaller size, black beak,
unbroken collar, and pale pink feet. Without being rare on our coasts
these two species are seldom offered on the market and are only of
particular interest to the specialized collector.
The Calidris, of somewhat the same size as the small Plovers, are
distinguished by their slimmer build, and above all by a more slender
and longer beak, which is at least as long as the head and often more
or less curved. From the point of view in which we are interested the
species most to be recommended is, I believe, the Dunlin ( Calidris
alpina) , easily recognized (except in winter) by a large, irregular black
patch on the under parts ; the rump is grey-brown, the secondary
wing feathers almost entirely white, the back speckled with spots
varying from black to chestnut brown. Always busy rummaging about
in all the corners of the aviary, it is a charming bird, getting on well
with its companions in captivity, even the Bengalese. I do not know
any other wader, except the Avocet, which becomes as rapidly and as
completely tame as the individuals of this species (see the accompanying
sketch--the three birds shown on the right).
The Dunlin is very common in spring and autumn in Lower Belgium
and in the whole of Holland, and is frequently offered for sale alive.
This is not the case with its cousin the Curlew Sandpiper ( Calidris

on account of its beautiful plumage in spring and summer. All the
under parts are a beautiful rust-brown, almost red, a colour which is
also found on the eyebrows and which is replaced in autumn and winter
by white. The blackish beak is much longer and more curved than in
any of the other Calidris , and this gives the bird the appearance of a
minute Curlew ; the general shape of the body and the feet are both
more elongated than in the Dunlin and its congeners. The Curlew
Sandpiper has the same behaviour, perhaps a little more sedate, as
those of the preceding species.
The Knot ( Calidris canutus) also has the upper parts reddish in the
breeding plumage, but the beak, as well as the legs are relatively
shorter than in the other Calidris , above all the Curlew Sandpiper.
The shape of this bird is distinctly superior to that of the other species
and its general appearance more thick-set. I have rarely seen it
offered for sale in our markets.
Further, I have never had the opportunity of acquiring living
specimens of the Purple Sandpiper ( Calidris maritima ), a rare species on
our shores and identified by the violet reflections in the brown feathers
of the under parts, the yellow legs, the black rump, and dumpy shape.
A special mention is due to the two smallest representatives of the
genus (and indeed of the whole family, Temminck's Stint ( Calidris
temminckii) and the Little Stint ( Calidris minuta ) which are not much
larger than a Wren.
Less remarkable so far as their coloration goes these two pigmies
attract attention by the very reason of their small size. Their general
colour is brownish grey--more ashy in the Temminck's and more
speckled with brown in the Little Stint ; in the latter the shafts of all
the wing feathers are white, whereas in the Temminck this is only
found on the first of these feathers. The under parts of the plumage are
mostly white ; the beak and legs are black and relatively short. I have
possessed and also exhibited at bird shows specimens of these little
waders which can be procured from time to time from the bird-
catchers and dealers in Holland. They are amusing, like little active
mice, and have always given me the impression that they are attending
to their particular occupations without caring much about the outside
world, but they lack a little the lively personality of their more sturdy
relatives. Mud-worms and ants' eggs are their favourite food in
captivity.
As I have never had the opportunity of studying them myself in
captivity I will only mention in passing the other rare Erolirue of our
winter fauna, the Broad-billed Sandpiper (Limicola falcinellus) with a
peculiarly shaped beak enlarged at the base, and the Sanderling
(Crocethia alba ) with particularly pale colouring and without a posterior

toe. I do not remember having seen them offered for sale alive in the
markets.
Common, on the other hand, and often sold by specialized dealers,
is the Common Sandpiper ( Actitis hypoleucos ), which distinctly differs
from the true Erolims and is in reality a small species of Triginte. This
bird frequents rivers and fresh water as much as the brackish estuaries
of the coast. The under parts, including the rump, are a uniform grey-
brown, contrasting with the white which covers the upper parts of the
body and forms transverse bars on the wings. The Common Sandpiper,
like the Wagtails, has a habit of almost continually jerking the tail,
which is an easy means of identifying it, even at a distance. It takes
easily to aviary life, where it associates readily with other species,
particularly with the Dunlin, which it has not been observed to do in
the wild state.
The Turnstone ( Arenaria inter pres) is another small species (hardly
bigger than the Ringed Plover) which can be procured from time to
time in single specimens. Very interesting in its behaviour,
indefatigable explorer of places covered with pebbles and gravel, this
little wader with short conical beak and yellow legs differs from all the
others by its plumage, speckled as if by hazard with irregular spots,
never identical, black, rust, and grey, on a white ground. It is satisfied
with the same conditions as the Plovers.
I have no original information on the life in captivity of the Waders
of that singular little family the Phalaropes (Phalaropus fulicarius and
Lobipes lobatus) which are distinguished by the presence of lobes on the
feet such as are found on the Gallinules ( Fulica atra , Coot).
I was waiting for a consignment of eggs from Iceland to put in in-
cubators on my rearing farm, which would without doubt have made
it possible for me to study completely the biology of these particularly
interesting and little known species. The outbreak of hostilities has
made the carrying out of this project impossible--at least in the near
future.
We must keep for another occasion the enumeration of the larger-
sized Limicola such as the Plovers, Lapwings, Redshanks, Greenshanks,
etc., as well as what is known of the exotic species which have already
been studied in captivity. Our experience has already shown that it
is better not to mix--in spite of their socialibity--medium-sized or
large birds with small species, as they always have a tendency to hustle
them, especially at meal times.
Avocets and Stilts
We have already reviewed, in the preceding part of this article, the
various small indigenous waders which are particularly interesting
to study in aviaries, although they do not need special care. The two

species about which I now wish to speak are of larger size, so that one
might call them medium Limicola , but nevertheless they can scarcely
be considered bulky if they are compared with wading birds such as
Storks, Herons, and Cranes. The treatment required for them in
captivity is, moreover, identical to that of the species already dealt
with, with which they will eventually get on well in the same enclosure.
The Avocet, Recurvirostra avosetta (L.)
The Avocet is one of the most remarkable and charming birds of the
European fauna. It can easily be recognized by a peculiarity almost
unique in the bird world : its long and slender beak, which forms a
pronounced upward curve almost in the shape of a sickle. This
singular morphological character is put to advantage by the bird
when it wishes to capture for its food the small animal life floating on
the surface of the water ; one sees the Avocet literally skimming the
water by means of a lateral movement of the convex lower part of its
beak.
Everything about the Avocet--its graceful shape, its striking
plumage, its gentle but timid movements, its sweet and slightly distant
manners--gives an impression of incomparable grace, and an elegance
of which the very feminine stamp has something aristocratic about it
of a " thoroughbred ". Its dress is a symphony of snow-white and jet-
black, outlined by the grey-blue, sea-green of the legs and by the patch
of red garnet of the eye. Such a dress would soon become rather dirty
in the muddy places which this gentle lady affects, but by her careful
and skilful movements she avoids the dirt and remains as immaculate
as the flowers of the large water-lilies and white Nenuphars near
which she is often found.
Never common, and a rare breeding bird in Belgium, the Avocet is
far less well known than in Holland, where there are several important
breeding grounds and where it is very popular and enjoys complete
protection. The other colonies in Europe are sparsely distributed on
the coasts of the Baltic, on the lakes and marshes of the Danube region,
and in the countries bordering the Mediterranean. It is always
difficult to procure living specimens on the market and it is without
doubt better that this should be so. Serious aviculturists naturally will
make greater efforts to do their best to take care of the specimens in
their collections which are the most difficult to replace. I have had the
opportunity of obtaining over a number of years from various sources
a considerable number of Avocets, both for my own aviaries and those
of my friends, and I can certify that these beautiful waders are relatively
very easy to keep in perfect health and apparently as contented as they
are at liberty if the general rules given in the first part of this article are
adhered to.

J. M. DERSCHEID--CHARM OF SMALL WADERS IN CAPTIVITY 151
But in addition two or three special points must be emphasized :--
Many Avocets offered for sale on the markets are birds of the year,
captured before they are able to fly properly or even fly at all ; these
specimens are usually very easy to accustom to their new conditions of
existence. It sometimes happens that one gets adult specimens which
are generally very much more wild, in this case it is always to be
feared that these birds suddenly let loose in an aviary will take flight
immediately, or after the first alarm, against the wire-netting with
such a force that they break or injure their fragile beaks. The remedy
consists in cutting three-quarters of the length of seven or eight longest
wing feathers, from one side only. This temporary pinioning prevents
the bird from flying till after the next moult, by which time it will
already be sufficiently tame and accustomed to its surroundings not
to dash its head against the partitions.
In general two weeks of captivity are sufficient for Avocets to have
lost all their wildness and they will even come to the feet of their
owner to get their favourite delicacy--mealworms. No other wader
becomes so easily accustomed to human beings nor acquires such a
degree of confidence. It is necessary always to take care (as is the case
with all animals) not to frighten your captives by the sound of talking,
by sudden movements, or by clothes of unusual colours.
The long bluish legs, covered with a tender and sensitive skin, are
the most delicate part of these birds. Far more than for the small
species of the shore, it is necessary to take care that the soil of the aviary
of the Avocets is soft and damp, or carpeted with peat, moss, or turf.
Their teguments, above all at the level of articulation, are not long in
becoming irritated by rough gravel, badly polished concrete, and above
all by coarse river sand, and the calosities which then form on the sole
of the foot-joints require long treatment and are difficult to cure. The
best remedy is that the pool of the aviary should be relatively very
long, but almost entirely filled with mud composed principally of peat
and fine white sand. It is in water of a depth of only just 5 cm. that
Avocets prefer to paddle and pass the greater part of the day.
Although they differ from the other waders (excepting the
Flamingoes) by the presence of webs between the three anterior toes,
Avocets are very poor swimmers, embarrassed no doubt by their long
legs. In these two particular cases (Avocets and Flamingoes) I think
that the presence of webbed feet cannot be interpreted as an adapta-
tion for swimming, but as a simple means of stopping the bird from
sinking in the muddy slime by increasing the surface of support without
lengthening the toes themselves (the second solution being that adopted
by the Rails and Waterhens, for example).
It is therefore quite useless for the pond in the Avocet aviary to be
deep enough in places for them to swim properly, but it is a good thing
that in the middle part the water should be 15 to 25 cm. deep ; the

152 J. M. DERSGHEID-CHARM OF SMALL WADERS IN CAPTIVITY
birds will go there several times a day to have their baths and clean
all their plumage.
A species naturally sociable, the Avocet has an absolutely peaceful
temperament. I have never seen mine molest or harry the smallest
waders, nor even certain birds belonging to different groups (Bearded
Tits, Panurus biarmicus , Reed Buntings, Cynchranus schceniclus, Wagtails,
Motacilla) which have on several occasions lived in the same aviaries
with them. It is only when face to face with their own kind that they
sometimes prove to be a little hostile, notably when one introduces a
newly arrived Avocet in an enclosure already occupied by several others
for some time. One can then see veritable " beak holding " in the
literal sense of the words, for the way of vying with each other in the
waders consists of endeavouring to seize the beak of the adversary and
pull his head down towards the ground or water. These fights are
silent and without any real danger, but it is possible that a bird, thus
tormented without ceasing by several of its companions, will not feed
well and will soon perish if he is not moved to another enclosure.
The Avocet is capable of breeding with success in captivity. This
fact was proved thirty years ago in the waders' aviary in the Zoological
Gardens of London, about which the Curator, Mr. Pocock, gave a
detailed description in the Avigultural Magazine, mentioning how
two of the five Avocets in the enclosure nested, hatched out two young,
and successfully brought up one of them. I have never had so much
success with my specimens, one of the difficulties being the impossibility
of distinguishing with any certainty the sexes in this species.
However, after a visit which I made in the spring of 1939 to a colony
of wild Avocets, I happened to find a nest of these birds which some
Grows had just discovered a few minutes before. At my approach the
Crows flew off, but not before having already eaten two of the four
eggs. The intact eggs appeared to be newly laid and not incubated,
and I brought them back with great care to my rearing farm where
they were placed under a bantam which hatched them out in due
course. From the same excursion I had also brought back a newly
hatched chick, fallen by accident, no doubt, into a hole with steep
sides, from which it had been unable to get out. These three specimens,
of which two had first seen the light of day here, were reared by me
entirely artificially (incubator with paraffin lamp) and two of them
attained adult state without difficulty, and enabled me to study the
complete development of this species from birth ; it is perhaps in-
teresting to note in passing that on emerging from the egg the young
Avocet has a short, straight beak, identical with the beak of a Redshank
or other Limicolce of the same age, but after the second day one can
observe the development of the upward curve at the end of the
mandibles. The legs of the chick are of an extreme size from the time
of hatching and already show the powder-blue colour which they

J. M. DERSCHEID-CHARM OF SMALL WADERS IN CAPTIVITY 1 53
keep without much alteration to the last. The rearing of these young
Avocets did not give me any particular trouble, and it was carried out
in the same way as the rearing of chicks of other Limicola (birds normally
nidifugous and very soon finding their food for themselves). The only
youngster which died before growing up committed suicide at two
weeks of age by drowning in a basin which was too deep and had too
slippery sides, which was left by mistake within reach. The young
chicks in down are delightful to look at in their dress of pearly grey
plush, decorated with brownish spots and stripes.
There are certain exotic species of Avocet which, however, differ a
little from the European form ; none of them, as far as I know, has
yet been imported alive.
The Stilts (Genus Himantopus)
The only near relations of the Avocets are the members of the genus
Himantopus , of which the type is the Black-winged Stilt ( Himantopus
himantopus ).
These birds have even longer legs than the Avocets, the red colour
of which is, moreover, one of their distinctive characteristics. The
beak is black, proportionally shorter and absolutely straight. The
plumage of the adult bird is entirely pure white with the exception of
the back, wings, and a ring round the eye, which are black.
It is a rare species in Belgium where it sometimes nests in small
numbers on heathland in the north of the country.
I will not say much about them as I have never had the opportunity
of possessing a living specimen ; the only specimens I have seen in
captivity were part of the collection in the London Zoo. It appears to
me, however, certain that these Stilts should do well in an aviary under
the same conditions which proved successful in the case of their
cousins the Avocets ; they have not, however, in my opinion, the
elegance of the latter, chiefly because of the exaggerated length and
slenderness of their legs.
I have also had the opportunity of examining at close quarters living
specimens of an exotic species--the Brazilian Stilt ( Himantopus
brasiliensis ) whose plumage is much more sombre. The birds had just
been imported by the firm of Blazer of Rotterdam, and in spite of their
recent voyage appeared to be in excellent health. However, I resisted
the temptation to acquire them, not having prepared at that time,
to my regret, a free aviary which would have suited them. It is to be
presumed, in view of their country of origin, that these black Brazilian
Stilts are more susceptible to cold than their relatives in Europe ;
they already evidently required to be placed in shelter from bad
weather and frost during the cold.
There is no record of the nesting or rearing of Stilts in captivity.

By Alan Lendon (Adelaide)
The season under review can be regarded as an average one only.
It was disappointing in that many early clutches were infertile, and of
those that did hatch early, many of the young birds died in the first
week or so. Since the previous season I had added a further ten aviaries,
making a total of thirty-four in all. For the first time on record, I
started the season with true pairs of all the thirty-four species of
Australian Parrakeets that I have ever kept, so that I was able to
accommodate each pair with an aviary to themselves and expectations
were consequently high. Twenty-five pairs eventually produced eggs
but only sixteen of these hatched young, the reason for failure in most
cases being infertility. Of the sixteen species which hatched, thirteen
were successfully reared. The total number of young believed hatched
was eighty-seven, of which fifty-three lived to leave the nest. This
percentage does not compare favourably with the two previous
seasons.
Some of the most notable failures were in pairs of birds which have
been reliable breeders for a number of years, as will be seen from the
detailed description which follows.
A review of the past ten seasons shows that of the thirty-four species
kept, thirty have laid, twenty-eight have hatched young, and twenty-
five species have been reared. The total number of young birds reared
in that time is exactly four hundred.

selves for the first time for some years, my old pair showed great
eagerness to make up for lack of opportunity in the past. The first
clutch, consisting of five eggs, was commenced on 11 th August, but
only two of these proved fertile and the remainder were removed.
Possibly because of this another clutch was commenced on
7th September, before the two remaining eggs had time to hatch.
On 13th September, two dead young ones were seen in the log and
were removed and the laying of the second clutch of six eggs was
continued as though nothing untoward had occurred. Of this clutch
three were fertile and the first hatched on 26th September, the second
on the 30th, and the third on 3rd October. These youngsters flourished
and the first emerged on 28th October, the second on 1st November,
and the third not until 8th November. At the time of leaving the nest
they were considered to be two cocks and one hen and this sexing was
subsequently confirmed.
The third clutch was commenced on 27th October, prior to any of
the young leaving the log and again consisted of six eggs. Possibly
because of the presence of the young in the log, all but two of these

eggs were addled and only one hatched ; this was on 23rd November,
and the following day the fourth clutch was commenced and the
young bird was neglected and died on 26th November. This fourth
clutch again consisted of six eggs, three of which were fertile. The
first had hatched by 14th December, and the remaining two a couple
of days later. One of these young only survived about a week, but the
remaining two were reared and left the nest on 13th and 18th January.
2. Barraband Parrakeet (Polytelis swainsoni ).--Following on their
success in 1945, this pair came into breeding condition about mid-
September and the first egg was seen on 5th October. Thereafter the
hen was not seen for some weeks, although the cock was seen emerging
from the log towards the end of that month. It was not until
31 st October that an opportunity of inspecting the log occurred and at
least three young were seen. A week later five were counted and there
were no remaining eggs, so presumably the clutch consisted of five
fertile eggs, as in the previous year. All the young flourished and the
first left the nest on nth December. None of these birds show as much
colour as the cock bird in 1945, but one is a slightly brighter green and
I think they will prove to be four hens and one cock, not an unhappy
result, as hens of this species are always scarce.
Rock Pebbler Parrakeet (P. anthopeplus ).--This pair followed on their
successes of the two previous years, the clutch of five eggs being com-
menced on 15th September. One egg was observed to be chipped on
8th October, three young were counted on 12th October and a
fourth could be seen a couple of days later. These flourished and the
first, apparently the youngest, left the nest very prematurely on
12th November, and although replaced several times, it persistently
reappeared and was found dead on 16th November. The first properly
fledged young left that day, the second on 21st November, and the
last two days later.
I always find immature birds of this species difficult to sex and these
three appear absolutely identical and I am rather inclined to think
they may be all of the same sex.
4. Alexandra Parrakeet (P. alexandra ).--My old hen had not pro-
duced any young since 1941, and on nth August I replaced her with
an aviary-bred hen about two years old. This bird came into breeding
condition almost at once, but the old cock was not very enamoured
of her for some time and when the first egg appeared on 3rd September
I was not very sanguine. The clutch consisted of five eggs, of which
one was laid on the ground and broken. Of the remaining four, only
two were fertile and one young bird was seen on 2nd October, the other
fertile egg failed to hatch, although the shell was almost completely
chipped. The young bird left the nest on 3rd November, and returned
again the same day and did not finally emerge until 5th November.
So far, I have not formed any definite opinion as to the sex.

mid-September, followed shortly after by the hen spending long
periods in the new extra large log provided. In late October, I felt
certain she was going to lay, but nothing eventuated, although she
still exhibited a desultory interest, even in early December, and the
cock still fed her occasionally about that time.

considerable interest in their log soon after it was placed in their

end of November.

this pair was a new bird obtained early in the year and the hen a semi-
tame bird that I had had since 1944. They never seemed particularly
friendly and although the hen spent a good deal of time ejecting the
contents of the log in September and October, no eggs appeared.
8. Adelaide Rosella (P. adelaidce). --This pair had never been
segregated prior to this year, although the hen has been in my posses-
sion for more than ten years. Rather unexpectedly a broken egg was
found in the log on 15th October, and two days later a second egg was
laid. This was broken the following day and I suspect the cock bird,
as he was seen emerging from the log on several occasions, a most
abnormal procedure for a cock Broadtail prior to the appearance of
young. Whether any further eggs were laid I do not know ; if they
were, they quickly disappeared.
9. Yellow Rosella (Yellow-rumped) (P. fiaveolus) .--This pair were
observed feeding during September and October and the hen spent a
good deal of time in the log but no eggs appeared. The species was
bred this year for the first time on record in South Australia by Mr.
H. J. Packer.
10. Green Rosella (Yellow-bellied) (P. caledonicus) .--The pair with
which I started the season had never been particularly well disposed
towards each other and when the cock bird became violently
enamoured of the hen Yellow Rosella in the adjoining flight I consi-
dered it time to make a change. His succesor, who had been a widower
for many years, was well disposed towards the hen from the start and
feeding was observed late in October. The first egg was laid on
6th November, the full clutch being four. All the eggs were fertile and
two young were seen on 30th November, and three a couple of days
later. The fate of the fourth egg is unknown. One young died in the
first few days, but the other two flourished until 23rd December,
which was very hot, when they were found dead, with full crops. This
was a great disappointment, especially as other young parrots of the

same age survived. The species has only been bred on one occasion
to my knowledge in this State.
11. Pale-headed Rosella (Mealy) (P. adscitus ).--This pair had been
successful in 1944 but had a series of misfortunes in 1945. This season
the first two eggs of the first clutch were laid early in August and
broken. However, a further six eggs were laid, of which five proved
fertile.
Four newly hatched young were seen on 9th September and a fifth
two days later. One young was dead by 15th, but the others did well
and left the nest on nth, 12th, 14th, and 15th October. The second
clutch of five eggs was started on 27th October, and all proved fertile.
The first two hatched on 22nd November, and all five by 26th, but
again one only survived a few days. The first two left the nest rather
prematurely in the heat on 23rd December and the two remaining
within the next few days.
I find this species very difficult to sex when immature ; at present
at least seven of the young look like hens to me, but I can hardly
believe this is so.
12. Northern Rosella (Brown's) (P. venustus ).--This pair, of which
the cock is minus most of his toes, have repeatedly laid, but the eggs
have always proved infertile. The year under review was no exception ;
the first clutch of three eggs being laid in March and the second of
four in mid-August. The second clutch was replaced by three Port
Lincoln eggs, one of which proved fertile but for some reason failed to
hatch, although the embryo was fully developed.
13. Eastern Rosella (P. eximius ).--This pair consisted of a cock of
the Golden-mantled variety and a hen which, because she had
allegedly come from Queensland and also because she had a good many
yellow feathers amongst the red ones on her head, I thought might
prove to be an immature Golden-mantled. However, I have no
doubt now that she is merely a slightly abnormal bird of the common
variety. The first egg of a clutch of six was laid on 3rd September, but
all proved infertile and were eventually removed on 28th September.
It soon became apparent that the hen would lay again and eggs were
seen under the sitting bird on 10th October. This clutch eventually
proved to be five in number, of which only two were fertile. I thought
I could hear young birds on 2nd November, and this was confirmed a
few days later when two were seen. The first young bird, a hen,
appeared somewhat prematurely on 2nd December, and was replaced ;
the other bird, a cock, made its first appearance on 5th December and
the hen reappeared, much stronger, the following day. The young
birds are indistinguishable from young Eastern Rosellas on leaving the
nest.

cock was the father of six good young in 1944, took a long time to

become friendly. However, feeding was observed late in September
and for the last two weeks of October the hen spent a lot of time in the
log and I expected eggs to appear any day. Early in November she
seldom appeared but still no sign of any eggs, and finally she was
discovered dead on 15th November. I do not think she ever laid.
15. Mallee Ringneck (Barnard's) (Barnardius barnardi ).--This pair
had bred successfully in the last two seasons. This year the first egg of
a clutch of six was laid on 8th August. The cock bird, who had not
looked too sprightly during the winter was found dead on 27th August
and the eggs proved infertile and were removed next day. I was able
to obtain a new mate immediately but the hen is a very masterful
lady and the period of introduction was stormy and necessitated a
good while in adjacent cages. However, by 16th September, the
hen appeared reconciled to the new husband and she laid the first
egg of the second clutch on 25th September. This time the clutch was
of five, but again they were all infertile and were eventually removed
on 19th October. Nothing daunted, she laid a third clutch, this time
of four, commencing on 31st October. Once again they were all clear
and I removed them on 12 th November and replaced them by two
Alexandra eggs given me by a friend. One of these proved fertile and
hatched, but the young bird was found dead on 2nd December,
possibly she was able to tell it was not a Broadtail, as she is usually
a model parent.
16. Cloncurry Ringneck ( B . macgillivrayi ).--This hen, who has
reared thirty young for me with two successive husbands since 1939,
was again widowed early this year and was mated with one of her sons,
bred in 1944. She came into breeding condition early in August and
spent a lot of time in the log, but the cock bird seemed bored with her
and also rather scared of her. An egg eventually appeared on
24th September, and was incubated but proved infertile and was
removed on 19th October.
Early in November I exchanged her mate for another of her sons,
bred in 1942, but she seemed even less pleased with him. However,
she laid a second clutch of two eggs early in December, but they too,
proved clear, and were removed on 18th December. I rather fear,
from the small clutches, that she is nearing the end of her breeding
career, although she has only once laid more than three eggs in a
clutch.
17. Port Lincoln Ringneck (Bauer's) (B. zonarius ).--This pair were
successful in 1944, but failed in 1945. This year, the first clutch was
commenced on 28th August and although six eggs were laid, all
were broken by the day following that on which they were laid, I
think by the hen. A second clutch was commenced on 26th September,
and four eggs were in the nest on 3rd October, and I hoped all would
be well, but by the next day they had all disappeared.

18. Twenty-eight Ringneck (Yellow-naped) (. B. semitorquatus ).--
This pair repeated their 1945 success, although they were so long in
starting that I became very sceptical of their intentions. However, the
first egg eventually appeared on 23rd November, and the clutch
consisted of four, all of which were fertile. Young were seen on
16th December and four could be counted on the 20th December.
Two of these died in the heat at Christmas time but the others
survived and the first, an obvious cock, left the nest on 24th January,
and the second, an equally obvious hen, the next day.
19. Pileated Parrakeet ( Purpureicephalus spurius). --Although feeding
was observed both in September and October, this pair never seemed
interested in the logs provided.
20. Red-vented Blue Bonnet ( Psephotus hamatorrhous) .--After successes
in 1944 and 1945, this pair's efforts resulted in a dismal failure in the
past season. The first egg of a clutch of six was laid on 19th August
and four eggs proved fertile. One young bird was seen on
16th September, but three days later two dead young were seen, a
third was fully developed but dead in the shell and in the case of the
fourth, the embryo had perished quite early. No further attempt at
nesting was made ; in fact, I have never known any of the Blue Bonnets
to be double brooded.
21. Yellow-vented Blue Bonnet ( Ps. xanthorrhous) .--Early in the
season, I was fortunate enough to secure a male of this species which
had bred several hybrids with a Red-vented hen. I mated him with a
hen which I had for several years, but, as usual, she showed no in-
clination to go to nest. About the middle of October, I exchanged her
for a new hen, but the cock took some time to become reconciled to the
change.
22. Little Blue Bonnet (Naretha) (Ps. narethce). --This pair were
disappointing after their success of the previous season. The first egg
of a clutch of five was laid on 9th August, and the hen sat very steadily.
A young bird was seen on 5th September, but a week later something
seemed amiss and on investigation two dead young were found, two
other eggs contained fully developed young dead in the shell and the
fifth egg was clear. For some time I thought they would nest again, but
nothing eventuated.
23. Hooded Parrakeet (Ps. dissimilis). --This pair had been successful
breeders every year since 1937, but unfortunately the hen lost a foot
late in 1945. I was doubtful about the effect on her fertility, but gave
her a trial. The first clutch, which consisted of five eggs, was com-
menced on 14th August, but all proved clear and were removed on
12th September.
A second clutch, again of five eggs, was started on 2nd October,
but again all proved infertile. I fear her breeding days are finished ;
the pair had reared thirty-four young for me since 1937.

24. Many-coloured Parrakeet ( Ps . varius ).--This pair continued
their unbroken run of successes, which date back to 1939. The first
clutch of five eggs was commenced on 5th August and young birds
seen on 29th August. Eventually, it transpired that four hatched, but
two died in the first week. The other two flourished and the first,
a cock, left the nest on 30th September, and the second, a hen, on

5th October. The second clutch of four eggs was commenced on
15th October. A single very newly hatched young bird was seen on
4th November, and three days later four could be counted. All
survived and the first, a cock, left the nest on 5th December, the
second and third, a pair, on 7th December, and the last, another hen,
the following day. One of these cock birds was the most highly
coloured young bird I have ever seen.
25. Red-rumped Parrakeet (Ps. hamatonotus ).--This pair repeated
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998048" page_id="56289274"  page_num="160" year="" vol="">
their 1945 performance of laying a clutch of clear eggs. The first
egg was laid on 21 st September and another two days later, but these
then disappeared. Another egg was laid from the perch a few days
later and then a clutch which eventually consisted of seven was com-
menced on 6th October. These were incubated, but all proved in-
fertile and were removed early in November.
26. Bourke Grass Parrakeet (,Neophema bourki ).--The hen of this
pair has never been a very reliable parent, but this year she reached an
all-time low record. The first clutch was commenced on 13th August
and consisted of six eggs, all but two of which were fertile. Young
were seen on 9th September, and four could be counted three days
later. One of these died within a few days and the remaining three
were dead by the 21st of that month. The second clutch was com-
menced one week later and again consisted of six eggs, five of which
were fertile. Young were first seen on 23rd October, and a few days
later four could be counted, the remaining fertile egg had a fully-
developed embryo in it. These young flourished and the first left the
nest on 19th November and the second and third on the two following
days. At this stage, both parents ceased feeding the young, in spite of
their persistent entreaties, and the fourth died without ever having
left the nest and two of the others also ; the eldest managed to survive
and proved to be a hen. This cessation of feeding was probably due
to the laying of the third clutch, which was started on 21st November.
This time eight eggs were laid, but only three proved fertile. These
duly hatched but were deserted when about a week old.
27. Blue-winged Grass Parrakeet (jV. chrysostoma ).--The hen of this
pair became interested in her log about the middle of October, and
from the end of that month until early in December seldom appeared,
but as far as I am aware no eggs were laid.

commenced on 22 nd August, but the cock bird was found dead three

days later, he had not previously appeared ill. A clutch of five was
completed and incubated but all proved clear and were removed on
12th September. A new cock bird had been introduced into the aviary
about a week earlier and a second clutch was commenced in the first
week of October. This consisted of five eggs, all of which proved
fertile and young were first seen on 23rd October. On the last day of
that month five could be counted and all thrived and left the nest
towards the end of the next month and the beginning of December.
One was found dead shortly afterwards, but the other four survived
and proved to be two of each sex. A third clutch of six eggs was com-
menced in the first week of December but all proved clear.
29. Orange-bellied Grass Parrakeet (JV. chrysogastra ).--Having had
the good fortune to secure the loan of a hen of this species in May of
1946, my hopes of breeding this very rare species were high. The pair
had never seemed very interested in each other and it was not until
Christmas time that the hen was seen in the log. Nothing further
eventuated until 21st January, when the hen looked off colour.
Inspection of the log revealed a single egg, but next day the hen was
dead ; she had been in captivity for several years and I think the
effort of egg-laying after so long proved too much for her. The egg
was placed under a Blue-wing in a friend's aviary, but proved in-
fertile.
30. Rock Grass Parrakeet ( JV. petrophila ).--I started the season with
a rather decrepit pair consisting of a cock with bad feet and a feather-
plucking hen, and an odd bird of hitherto unknown sex. The old pair
seemed completely disinterested as the breeding season approached,
but towards the end of October the odd bird revealed her sex by
entering the log a good deal and frequently importuning the mated
cock bird to feed her. On 1st November I hopefully removed the
mated hen and a clutch of four eggs was commenced on
nth November. These proved clear, as expected, and were removed
on 24th November. A week previously I had the good fortune to
obtain another cock bird and he was observed to feed the hen the same
day that I removed her eggs. A second clutch of three eggs was com-
menced on 5th December and all proved fertile. When I returned
from holidays on 12 th January, there were two large youngsters in
the nest ; the third egg or young had disappeared. Both flourished
and eventually left the nest on 30th and 31st January ; I suspect they
had left several days earlier and returned to it again. These proved to
be a pair and moulted into adult plumage within three months of
leaving the nest.
31. Turquoise Grass Parrakeet (JV. pulchella ).--This pair maintained
their good record of the two previous years. The first clutch was
started on 19th August but the hen had trouble in laying the fifth
egg and had to be given warmth. When returned to the aviary next

day, she appeared likely to continue incubation, but all the eggs were
broken a couple of days later.
The first egg of the second clutch of five was laid on 3rd September ;
on 27th September one young was seen and a week later there was still
only one ; the other eggs were removed and two proved clear and
the other two contained fully developed embryos. The solitary young
was reared and left the nest on 29th October ; it proved to be a cock
although when it left the nest it did not show any chestnut feathers on
the shoulders ; this, in my experience, is most unusual.
The third clutch was commenced on 21st October, well before the
single young bird left the nest ; this time six eggs were laid. Young
were first seen on 18th November, and five could be counted a few
days later, the sixth egg was clear. All five were reared and left the
nest between 13th and 25th December, proving to be two cocks and
three hens ; once again one of the cocks had no chestnut shoulder
patches.
A fourth clutch was started on 18th December and on 14th January
there were two living young birds and one dead one, the other three
eggs were clear. These two, a pair, were reared and left the nest
about the middle of February.
32. Scarlet-chested Grass Parrakeet (jV. splendido) .--This pair, with
many past successes to their credit, seem to be coming to the end of
their breeding career ; the hen has got extremely fat. The first clutch
of six eggs was commenced on 29th August ; five of these were fertile
and hatching commenced on 24th September. All five eventually
hatched, but three were allowed to die quite early, the other two
survived and left the log rather prematurely on 21st October ; they
were not perching for a further week. Both these birds left the nest
with very pale flight feathers, they subsequently proved to be cocks.
The second clutch of five was commenced on 23rd October. All
were fertile and duly hatched, but all were dead by 24th November.
A third clutch, again of five, was commenced on 5th December, three
of these were hatched but again allowed to die. I am inclined to blame
the hen's laziness and reluctance to feed for this failure.
33. Swift Parrakeet ( Lathamus discolor) .--This pair had laid in the
previous two seasons without complete success. This year they
raised my hopes by coming into breeding condition considerably earlier
than usual, feeding being noted in September and the hen being seen
in the log in November. The first egg appeared on 24th December,
and when I returned from holiday on 13th January there were two
clear eggs in the log. Both birds managed to escape about a fortnight
later and one of them was subsequently found dead in the Zoo !
34. Budgerigar ( Melopsittacus undulatus). --A pair of common Greens
were kept, but, strange to relate, showed not the slightest inclination
to go to nest.

PHEASANTS IN LONDON AND AT WHIPSNADE

Pheasant rearing has always appealed to me as a fascinating pursuit,
and when I took on the post of Curator of Birds at the London
Zoological Gardens in 1909 I determined to see what could be done
in this direction from the stock of birds there. Something had been
done in Pheasant rearing a few years before by the then head keeper,
Bertling, but the stock had greatly deteriorated.
A very essential point in Pheasant rearing is the necessity of clean
ground for the young birds and this was scarce in the London Zoo
even then, and Whipsnade was not in being. There was, however,
one large paddock which had recently been taken in from the Park and
upon which birds had never, so far as we knew, been reared, and so
one saw possibilities.
In the early part of the year 1910 some old Hearson's incubators,
which, by the way, are still in use though they must be nearly forty
years old, were put into order and we were able to obtain a few light
broody hens, though to get the right type of birds for this purpose it is
necessary to keep a breeding stock of such kinds as Silkies or a cross
with this breed and a Bantam. We found that the Silkie and Red
Jungle-fowl cross was ideal. We also obtained a Hearson's foster-
mother, which proved so great a success that we made another, and
with the two of them reared a large number of birds quite successfully
during the following season. Altogether we reared in the 1910 season
some ninety birds, including Mongolian, Gold, Amherst, Elliot's,
Principalis, Kalij, Polyplectrons, a Horned Tragopan, and a Globose
Gurassow. In the next few years we had even better success as we
were able to increase our breeding stock ; thus I find from my notes
that in 1912 we reared quite a number of Sonneratt's Jungle-fowl,
besides hybrids between the very distinct Green, or Javan, and the Red
Jungle-fowl, three Tragopans, Swinhoe's, Elliot's, Black-backed
Kalij, and a number of the commoner sorts, while the incubators and
foster-mothers proved their value in the successful rearing of some very
rare American Quail chicks --Lophortyx douglasi, Colinus pectoralis, and
Eupsychortyx nigrigularis. It is difficult to persuade most of the Quails
to incubate in an aviary such as those at the Zoo, where there is bound
to be disturbance, and it is a great advantage to be able to incubate and
rear by artificial means.
For some years we had fair success, but it became more and more
difficult, as the ground began to be appropriated for houses and animal
enclosures, which, no doubt, were of more attraction to the general

<bodyText confidence="0.998275711111111" page_id="56289278"  page_num="164" year="" vol="">
public. So we were forced to give up Pheasant breeding at the London
Zoo.
When Whipsnade Park came into being we began sending eggs
there from London, but with very little success. Few eggs hatched,
possibly from the shaking they had on the transport lorry, and
without proper means of rearing the chicks few survived. Perhaps the
pens in London were getting stale in spite of annual returfing.
It became evident long ago that if successful Pheasant-breeding
were to be undertaken, new pheasantries would have to be built at
Whipsnade, but unfortunately the powers that were did not see the
immediate importance of a scheme which would not have much appeal
to the paying visitors and many other matters were deemed to be more
necessary. So nothing was done.
At the present time the breeding of ornamental Pheasants is of vital
importance, since the stock in this country is at a low ebb, and it is very
satisfactory to be able to report that Pheasant breeding is now an
established fact at Whipsnade and bids fair to be very successful.
In the old days in London we had a young keeper who came from
a family of gamekeepers in Scotland and had been taught from his
early youth the art of rearing young chicks and guarding them from
prowling enemies. His father in the Highlands had to contend with
mountain foxes and Scottish wild cats, but Angus MacDonald soon
got to understand the wiles of the rat and the stray domestic cat. He
has now retired, after a long and faithful service at the London Zoo
and Whipsnade Park, where he became Head Keeper.
The Zoological Society has been fortunate in finding another young
keeper at Whipsnade of gamekeeper stock and whose heart is
thoroughly in his job. Leslie Simmons has made a first-class start.
Last year he put up pens with the rough material then available and
reared a good many young birds from a small stock of the more
ordinary kinds, and so successful was he that Dr. Vevers encouraged
him to erect a more ambitious pheasantry and was able to supply him
with a stock of really good birds, mostly from the fine collection
maintained through the war at Leckford. When I visited the new
pheasantry I was surprised and delighted, to say the least of it, for it is
a fine achievement, seeing the short time Leslie Simmons had, with
very little help, to build it during last autumn and the winter, when for
long spells work was out of the question on account of snow. It is built
in a quiet spot, out of range of the ordinary visitor, though those
interested in Pheasants would only have to apply to the Superintendent
to obtain permission to see it. The site is on a sloping hillside facing
south-west and sheltered at the back by trees. It consists of a range
of twenty pens, each one some twenty feet wide, with shelter shed ;
turfed and planted with shrubs. A delightful spot, quiet, clean,
and healthy.

I understand amongst the chicks reared are Temminck's and
Horned Tragopans, Swinhoe's, Edward's, Reeve's, Mongolian,
Melanistic, Amherst, Gold, and quite a number of Blue Grossoptilons.
Eggs were hatched in incubators and the chicks reared under light hens,
of which a good stock is maintained.
So far the birds have done well in their new quarters, though the
loss of the Mikado and Monaul hens has been a blow. I understand
that the Society is expecting Monauls and two species of Kalij from
Calcutta shortly.

The registry has revealed the fact that whereas the aviaries of
Great Britain are lamentably short of most species of the rarer
Parrakeets, one or two are reasonably well represented and may be
considered to be holding their own.
Members of the Avicultural Society responded remarkably well
and returns were made almost without exception, so that as far as they
are concerned the registry is fairly complete. There are, of course,
many non-members who keep Parrot-like birds and every effort has
been made to contact them. It can safely be said that details were
obtained from all the owners of large collections, but there are many
possessors of just one or two pairs who have not completed forms, in
the majority of cases because they consider their birds of insufficient
importance to warrant registration. The trade was not canvassed
owing to its stock being a floating population. Thus, it is impossible to
draw any conclusions regarding comparative numerical strengths.
The table gives the totals recorded for all the species listed in the
registry, and is followed by general observations thereon, with addi-
tional species not on the list.
It is possible that there has been duplication in some instances
owing to change of ownership, etc., but every care has been taken to
avoid double entries.
It must be borne in mind that many so-called breeding pairs are
somewhat aged birds and of doubtful reproductive capabilities.

breeding successes, no matter of what species, are of interest and
should be recorded.
Barraband's Parrakeet.--Eighteen pairs, apparently only one odd

Red Rosella Parrakeet.--There are eighteen pairs amongst the

Golden-mantled Rosella Parrakeet.--The G.-M. outnumber the
Red by two to one--43 pairs. One cannot help wondering whether
all the G.-M. bred and advertised are really splendidus.
Mealy Rosella Parrakeet.--This once neglected species is near
the top as regards numbers, and forty-one pairs are on the register.
Stanley Parrakeet.--No less than 133 birds, including forty-nine
pairs, makes this one of the strongest species numerically. This must
be very gratifying to the Duke of Bedford, who some years ago did so
much to build up a breeding stock of this Parrakeet, and prevented
its extinction in European aviaries.
Pennant's Parrakeet.--Sixteen pairs.
Brown's Parrakeet.---Always scarce, this very attractive Broadtail is
now reduced to three pairs and a few odd birds.
Barnard's Parrakeet.--Twenty-six birds--eleven pairs.
Bauer's Parrakeet.--Stock reduced to eight birds, only one of which
is recorded as a hen.
Red-rumped Parrakeet.--A total of 177 indicated that this is the
commonest Parrakeet. There are sixty-five pairs registered : also
twenty-one yellow and split-yellow.
Many-coloured Parrakeet.--Twelve pairs amongst the thirty-three
birds recorded.
Blue-bonnet Parrakeet.--A single Red-vented hen and four Yellow-
vented are the only Blue-bonnets on the register.
Hooded Parrakeet.--One pair owned by Mr. Crawford
McCullagh.
Splendid Grass Parrakeet.--Reduced to eleven birds, five of which,

"THE LORIQUET" OR "HANGING

I wonder if any member of the Avicultural Society has had the
extreme pleasure of owning a pair of Hanging Parrakeets. Every bird-
lover's collection in India is incomplete without a pair of these
gems of Aviculture, real charming little acrobats. There are three
species which very often find their way into the Indian markets, where
they are sold for a few shillings a pair. I shall now endeavour to
describe each in order of their rarity :--
(1) Loriculus galgulus .--This is the most striking little Loriquet of the
lot. He is no bigger than a Sparrow, with a short, square tail. The
prevailing colour of his plumage is green and he sports a crown of rich
blue with red patches on the throat and rump. To add to these con-
trasting colours there are also yellow patches, one on the shoulders and
another lower down. This and the red on the throat are absent in the
hen, thus making sexing easy. This species comes from Malaya.

(2) Loriculus asiaticus .--This Loriquet from Ceylon is very similar
to the above, except that the blue on the crown is replaced by red and
he has no yellow markings at all. He also lacks the red on the throat.
(3) Loriculus vernalis .--This is the most common of the lot coming
naturally from the Continent of India. Is also found in Burma, Assam,
and the Andamans. He is not too handsome a fellow, being all green,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.973571666666667" page_id="56289284"  page_num="170" year="" vol="">
red-rumped, and sporting a blue patch on the throat, and which is
absent in the female. However, it has one point in its favour and that
is its friendliness.
The Loriquet is a very common bird of India and considered a real
pest by the Indian farmer, as their food mostly consists of fruits and
berries. At certain times of the year, however, they live almost entirely
on the nectar of flowers.
These birds, inhabiting well-wooded country, orchards, and planta-
tions, are met with singly or in small parties, but owing to their small
size and colouring are naturally overlooked among the tall trees. The
only possible time to detect them is when they fly from one tree
to another. Their flight is very rapid and consists of many fast
wing-strokes and then a temporary short pause, resulting naturally
in a slight dip.
I have on several occasions tried to breed all of these three species
in India, but have never been anywhere near even hopeful, nor have
I heard of any successes out there. If anyone has been successful in
England I sure would like to have particulars, and the species bred.
In their wild state, however, their nesting season lies between
January and April. They generally lay three white eggs in a hole
which they make in some rotten branch not too high from off the
ground. The female makes an exemplary mother and rather than
forsake her eggs would even permit herself to be caught.
In captivity the Loriquet makes a very friendly and amusing pet.
One can watch them for hours clambering along the twigs, uttering
the while their sharp and quaint call. They become very tame and
their wants are ever so little. They thrive on a very simple diet indeed.
All one needs to satisfy these little gems is any kind of soft, pulpy
fruit and boiled rice. To watch them hanging like bats (hence the
name Bat-Parrots) when roosting at night, with head hanging down-
wards, is often very amusing, yet at the same time often makes one
uncomfortable wondering if they will fall down when asleep during
the night.

NESTING OF WILD AGAPORNIS
By R. E. Moreau
Mr. R. E. Moreau has sent a copy of his important paper
"The Dwarf Parrots (. Agapornis ) of Tanganyika" ( Tanganyika Notes

and Records 19 (1945) : 22-33) an d has kindly given permission
for its reproduction in the Avicultural Magazine. Unfortunately,
it is too lengthy to reproduce as a whole. The part of most interest
to aviculturists is that in which Mr. Moreau describes colonies of
Masked and Fischer's Lovebirds that have established themselves on
the coast. After giving the geographical ranges he writes :--*
"In addition to the foregoing ' natural ranges ' there are at least
two places on the coast, Tanga and Dar-es-Salaam, where escaped
Agapornis have maintained a breeding population for probably twenty
years. European aviculturists got excited when the Yellow-collared
species was introduced to them in 1925 and for a short time a vigorous
export of this species and of A. jischeri went on. I remember seeing
crate after crate of them in shops on Acacia Avenue in Dar-es-Salaam
in 1928. The birds were, of course, crowded and shipped under bad
conditions, and Government stopped the traffic. Probably most of the
escapes date from this time, but something like two hundred were also

<listItem confidence="0.9704719" page_id="56289285"  page_num="171" year="" vol="">
set free in Dar-es-Salaam in 1939.
" In Tanga the wild birds are, I think, all A. Jischeri. As many as
twenty may be seen together. I have reason to believe that they have
nested in the roof of the hospital and in the crevices of a neighbouring
building now demolished. They also go in and out of the nests of the
Indian Swifts ( Colletoptera affinis), where they probably also breed.
" In Dar-es-Salaam the birds are nearly all A. per sonata. They
frequent the Indian Swifts' nests on the church and breed in the roof
of at least one of the European quarters.
" A. Jischeri, A. per sonata, and A. liliana are stated to make a ' domed

nest ' in captivity, even when provided with a nest-box, but apparently
the doming is not skilful work like a Sunbird's or a Weaver's. It seems
to be achieved by stuffing a cavity, bottom, sides, and top, with rather
stiff nesting material or by building up a circular wall (with an entrance
hole) and laying more material over the top. The Agapornis seem
incapable of interweaving their material. Wild nests are usually in
such confined spaces that it is most difficult to get the nests out intact,
even if they did not tend to fall to pieces.
" Most of the exact information we have about the nests of A.
per sonata we owe to the enthusiasm of Dr. W. A. Young. He very
kindly sent me one of several nests that he got out of the roof of one of
the European quarters in Dar-es-Salaam. Perhaps its form had been

affected by the site, which was in the 3 in. space between the tiles
and the parallel boarding below it. Rough strips up to about 7 mm.
wide and 180 mm. (7 in.) long had been torn from the leaves of coco
palms and arranged artlessly in a pad, with containing walls that must
have practically filled the 3 in. space. There was a lining of much
thinner, but still decidedly harsh, fibres. Making all allowances for the
difficulty of getting such a loose nest out of such a place (the tile had
to be lifted to get at it at all), I do not think that the birds had built
a dome, nor that there was room for it. This nest contained eggs
(number not quite certain), besides one or two tiny bright green
contour-feathers, and was perfectly clean. On the other hand, another
nest Dr. Young examined in the roof of the G.M.S. Hospital at
Kilimatinde, 4 a mere mass of stout dry bents (stout as twigs) ' was
4 matted together with faeces '. It looks as if the nests were used
subsequently for roosting and that at that stage the birds paid no
attention to sanitation. Another nest, one of those located in the roof
of the hotel at Dodoma by Dr. Young, and kindly sent to me by
Dr. E. W. C. Jobson, was filthy and smelt like a neglected fowl-house. It
was an artless mass, about 10 in. in diameter, made of fibres, probably
shredded from a palm, and stiff, but altogether finer than those forming
the Dar-es-Salaam nest, mixed with small twigs, a few bits of string,
and wisps of raw cotton. A very sketchy central cavity contained a few
contour feathers, numerous pellets of dung, and one very stale egg.
44 No doubt the nature of the nest varies with the site. If, as appears,
the Parrots use the nests of Indian Swifts at Dar-es-Salaam, they will
not be able to do much building inside them. There was probably
even less chance of their doing so in the Barbet's nest with entrance
only 1 \ in. wide, in a tree at Mondul, where they had young. [H. F. I.
Elliott in litt ]. Other natural tree-holes probably do not give the
Parrots much spare room either, except perhaps in baobabs, which
the birds certainly use.
"A. Jischeri apparently nests in colonies among the frond-bases in
the heads of palm trees, as well as in holes in baobabs. It uses
Starlings' nests and in Tanga apparently also Indian Swifts'. No
description of actual nests is available except for some in the court-
house at Nzega. The walls of the building are of mud-brick, with about
6 inches of stone along the top. The nests were placed in depressions in
these stones and supported against the withies which hold up the thatch.
They consisted of thorn twigs untidily laid one across the other and an
apology for a lining had been made from the straw of the thatch.
When picked up they disintegrated as there was no weaving in the
construction (Bell).
44 Apart from building actual nests, A. jischeri and A. per sonata
are said to bung up the entrance of the cavity with thorny twigs, which
they may indeed systematically remove, 'park', and replace as they

enter and leave. Critical observations on the prevalence of this habit
would be welcome.
" It may be mentioned that certain Agapornis spp., not occurring in
Tanganyika, have been observed in captivity to carry building material
by thrusting it between the contour-feathers, especially those of the
rump. Nothing of the sort has yet been observed in wild birds. This
method of carriage would be impossible with any but soft pliable
material and is apparently inefficient even with that. The stiff material
that forms the bulk of the nests in Tanganyika could almost certainly
not be carried except in the beak ; but the point is an interesting one,
worth looking out for.
44 The enthusiasm with which A. per sonata and, perhaps to a lesser
extent, A. fischeri have taken to nesting in the roofs of buildings of
European type is very remarkable. In addition to the cases already
cited, A. per sonata nested in at least two of the European quarters at
Dodoma ; in one there are 4 at least three parties each of four or five
birds 5 [Marion Coster in litt ]. Years ago, Loveridge found them
using the roof of Nzingi railway station, the next up the line from
Dodoma. Here there was an interesting variant, for the birds 4 had
pecked out grooves in the supporting beam so as to facilitate their
ingress '.
44 Nests tucked into the roofs of European buildings must, one would
think, be much hotter than in natural sites. The Dar-es-Salaam colony
was in the three-inch space between tiles and boarding. Practically all
the other roofs mentioned as housing Agapornis are of iron and one
would think that the temperatures generated under them in a place
like Dodoma must be terrific. In at least one instance there the nest
was in perhaps the hottest possible situation, inside the little tunnel
formed by the iron ridging. In such a place the insulation provided
by a 4 domed nest 5 would seem to be an absolute necessity : but even
the air temperature would be so high that it is astonishing the birds,
whether adults or young, can endure it. It would be most interesting
to obtain some temperatures inside such nests, by means of a distance
recording thermometer or a thermo-couple ; and also to ascertain how
the incubation behaviour in such a situation compares with that in a
more normal one.
44 I know of no published record of eggs of A. fischeri, A. personata , or
A. liliame taken in the wild state. However, Dr. Leakey tells me that
he has taken several clutches of up to five eggs of A. fischeri . The
clutches in the Dar-es-Salaam colony of A. personata probably averaged
at least six eggs ; and native information at Mpwapwa is that nests
there contain five to six. More precise information on this point is
wanted. Even to the better-known A. pull aria this applies, because one
author has given its clutch as two to three and another as five to seven.

of the embryo inside. The wisps of down on the unhatched bird were

omissions that will at once strike the least critical of readers, but
thought it best to rely entirely on my own observations, inadequate

D. GOODWIN-NOTES ON WINTER AND PASSAGE MIGRANTS 175
behaviour appears to be indulged in whenever the bird halts to feed
or rest for any length of time. In April, 1942, in a wadi near Gazala
(Libya) it was particularly noticeable that pairs, or at any rate a
cock and a hen, were sharing such territories. Any cock bird trespassing
was vigorously driven away, but the hen bird appeared only to
arouse a very mild animosity if she ventured within a few feet of the
male. Desert and Black-eared Wheatears were always attacked fiercely
if they approached cock birds of the common species. This may be
because they always turn tail and flee in a most obliging manner,
but I think the main reason is that the bright contrast of black and
white plumage plays a great part in arousing the birds' hostility (as
it certainly does in the case of the Red-rumped Ghat) and the two
latter species, dull as their stuffed skins may be in a cabinet, appear a
most striking creamy white and jet when seen alive beneath a brilliant
sun. I have seen a Desert Wheatear chased away, time after time, by
Common Wheatears when it attempted to feed in a " green " area of
about four acres in extent.
This bird is very common on passage in all three of the countries
under discussion, but most of the foregoing behaviour was noted in
Eastern Libya, where the bird is very abundant from early February
until late in May. Aggressive territorial behaviour also takes place in
autumn, however, and I have heard birds singing near Tobruk in
October, as well as in the spring.
Black-eared Wheatear .--Very abundant near Cairo on spring migra-
tion in March and April, and probably equally so in autumn, but in
Libya and Malta did not notice more than an odd bird or two in
autumn. Both pale and dark-throated forms seen, the latter by far the
more numerous. Always singly, but often several in the same area.
Desert Wheatear .--Several of these birds seen singly in Libya in the
spring were possibly on passage, but none were seen at Tobruk the
previous autumn and many were indulging in what appeared to be a
display-flight, the bird rising into the air singing and flying in a wide
circle, usually alighting on some bush top two or three times en route
for a few seconds, and returning to, or near to, its original perch.
Whinchat .--Many seen on passage in Libya and Malta, chiefly in
May, always perched singly, but usually many in a fairly small area.
Stonechat .--When these birds first arrive in Malta in October, there
is a great deal of excited chasing about and constant calling, which
soon subsides, leaving the birds in pairs, or at least a cock and hen
sharing the same territory throughout the winter, which they do
without any animosity, though also as far as I could observe without
any display of regard or even interest for each other. Those Stonechats
which I saw in Libya and Egypt in the winter were also in pairs, but
I did not actually there keep a watch on any one pair for the whole of
the winter, as I was able to in Malta.

Redstart .--Common passage migrant, usually several in same area
but birds usually appear to be travelling singly.
Black Redstart .--Hen birds very common on Malta in winter, but
saw only one cock bird in spite of carefully watching out for others.
Frequents bombed buildings and waste sites in the middle of Valetta,
as well as open and rocky ground. Both sexes plentiful about ruins
and rocky wadis near Cyrene (Libya) in January and February.
Several hen birds seen near Cairo in winter. A friend, who was at
Benghazi in the winter of 1944, said that there the bird was very
common, but cocks were greatly in the majority. In all cases birds
seemed to remain singly in their territories.
Robin .--Common in winter in Libya, about Cyrene, and other
places, where there is a fair amount of green cover and also in some
of the deeper bush-grown wadis on the coast in desert regions. Some
also winter near Cairo. In Malta very common in winter, where it
sings and holds territory, as I have no doubt it does elsewhere, but
have not been able to ascertain.
Song Thrush .--Common in winter on Malta but excessively shy and
wary owing to persecution. At times very abundant near Cairo in
January and February but fluctuating numbers suggest that these may
have been passage-migrants. Several seen in a wadi at Tobruk in
February were so starved that I was able to capture two by driving
them up the wadi sides as they were incapable of flight. Some Lap-
wings also present were obviously very weak, although able to fly,
but a pair of Blackbirds (the only ones I ever saw overseas except for
a single cock bird near Cairo), Stonechats, White Wagtails, and
Crested Larks in the same area did not appear in any way distressed.
Grey Wagtail .--Fairly common, though not anywhere very abun-
dant, in Egypt and Malta in winter and about Cyrene in Libya.
Also common passage migrant in Malta. Always seen singly near
ditches, streams, or water of some description.
White Wagtail .--This absurdly named bird is fairly plentiful in
Malta in winter and from mid-October until April in Libya and
Egypt I have found it extremely numerous in every type of country.
Probably there are none in the more barren parts of the deserts, but in
every camp that I have visited, however bare and arid the surrounding
desert, the dainty little black, grey, and white bird has always been
present ; doing his poor best towards decreasing the numbers of that
plague of life, the common house-fly, and also living to a large extent
on any scraps of bread or other artificial food small enough to be
swallowed.
Odd single birds are common in Autumn and are to be seen at
other times, but generally speaking the White Wagtails associate in
pairs which forage over a rather loosely defined territory during the
day. The hen bird, when she has been temporarily separated from the

cock greets his appearance with excited cries and adopts an odd,
statuesque posture, with head and tail held at an angle of about
45 degrees, rather suggestive of the pose of a hen bird inviting coition,
save that she does not crouch. The cock usually seems indifferent to
this display, although the rather exaggerated gait with which he
stalks away suggests that this may be the appropriate response. (The
commonest display of paired Mallards is an obvious analogy.) At
times, however, the cock bird, if the hen approaches too closely, and
particularly if she solicits him with cringing posture and quivering
wings, as she occasionally does, will dart at her with an angry bill-
snapping, such as both sexes use when threatening other species, and
drive her away. Most of the initiative for keeping contact seems to be
left to the hen, the cock invariably leading the way, or rather as it
seems going his own way and leaving his companion to follow or not
as she chooses, whether in foraging on the ground or in taking flight.
At night the White Wagtails roost communally and, judging from the
numbers of birds that one sees flying in the same direction at evening-
time, some of the roosts must be of great size. Others, however, are
quite small, and in the winter of 1944-5 about twenty birds regularly
roosted in some ornamental trees in a camp on the desert edge not far
from Cairo.
In some of the cultivated fields in the Nile Delta the Wagtails are
present in such numbers that it is not always easy to pick out the pairs,
but with a little watching and waiting it can usually be done. Whether
this habit of associating in pairs during the winter in any way
anticipates or re-establishes contacts of individuals that have, or will be,
paired in the their breeding quarters, only a most comprehensive
system of ringing is likely to elucidate. But the fact that most of the
cock birds leave by about the middle of March, whilst the hens are
still very much in evidence for some time afterwards and do not en-
tirely vanish until about the third week in April, rather suggests other-
wise.
Tellow Wagtail (Blue-headed form).--Common passage migrant in
all three countries, usually in small flocks of from ten to fifty indivi-
duals, but single birds quite often seen, at least in the desert in autumn.
In a wadi near Gazala that was a sort of caravanserai for migrants the
first parties that came through in April consisted mostly of cock birds,
but later the sex ratio changed and the majority of those seen after
the first few days of May were hens, the last party seen being nine hens
on the 17th if I remember rightly. Most of the birds seen appeared to
be of the typical blue-headed form, but I would not like to be at all
dogmatic about the prevalence, or otherwise, of different races,
particularly as one bird which I had a very good view of I have not
yet been able to " pin down 55 with any certainty. In Libya, most
parties seen (of cocks) usually had one or two Black-headed Wagtails

amongst their number, the one race of Yellow Wagtails delightfully
easy to identify in the field, and more rarely an odd Yellow Wagtail
of the British form, or at least identical to it in appearance.
Meadow Pipit .--Very common winter (and passage ?) migrant in
Libya and Malta. Usually in small parties that straggle about a good
deal and rise individually or in twos or threes when alarmed, uttering
the characteristic call-note, but single birds very frequently seen.
Sky-lark .--In winter, common on Malta and extremely abundant in
the coastal regions of eastern Libya and Egypt. Birds generally in
company, but as with the previous species, though to a lesser extent,
there is little of the sort of flock-cohesion shown by such birds as
Starlings. Have never heard it sing in its winter quarters as the British
race at times does, though presumably the latter is not a migrant unless
forced by circumstances as is the case with those that breed on the
Yorkshire moors for example. At camps in the desert the bird
frequently gathers in large numbers and feeds readily on artificial
food, which rather surprised me at first, in view of the fact that the few
starving British Sky-larks that I have picked up in hard winters have,
like Redwings in like circumstances, refused to touch it.
Short-toed Lark .--Extremely abundant in winter in Egypt and pro-
bably large numbers of the birds seen in Libya at that season are
winter-migrants. The behaviour of flocks seen in February and
March when other birds of the same species (but possibly not the same
race) were breeding everywhere in the vicinity, certainly suggested
this. These flocks fed largely on the seeds of a plant much resembling
shepherd's purse, taking the seeds from the growing plants in a
Linnet-like manner and were always ready to take artificial food,
pecking away at hard lumps of army biscuit in a style worthy of a
House Sparrow. On Malta this bird is a summer visitor, arriving
in April and departing again before winter.
Chaffinch .--Present in fair numbers in winter near Gyrene, in Libya,
a,nd in the Nile Delta, also on Malta, where large numbers came at
sunset to roost in a shrubbery in some public gardens in Valetta.
Behaviour, apart from initial migration, not differing from that of
those in Britain in winter.
Linnet .--Very abundant. Always in flocks, often in company with
Serins. These birds are presumably the Mediterranean form and are
noticeably brighter in colour, with a large area of bright carmine on
the breast, the cocks being in full plumage in February in Egypt and
by early March in Malta. In the latter country the birds sing con-
tinuously in March before leaving. Only one bird seen in Libya, a
solitary specimen feeding with Serins.
Goldfinch .--Very plentiful about Gyrene in January and February,
feeding on the cones, or rather the seeds therein, of coniferous trees
in company with Siskins. A few also seen on Malta. A small party

could be seen almost daily feeding on the seeds of garden flowers in
a garden in a camp on the desert edge in the winter, but as I saw no
others in Egypt and the bird is said to have at one time bred regularly
near Cairo, but later to have become extinct, it seems possible that these
birds may have been the last remnants of these resident birds.
Serin. --Common on Malta in winter, also about Cyrene in Libya.
Behaviour as Linnet and, like that bird, the flocks sing persistently
during their stay, though as I do not know this bird in its breeding range
I cannot say whether the same notes are sung as in summer.
Chiffchaff. --Common winter (and passage ?) migrant in Egypt and
Malta, in both of which places it commences to utter its well-known
call notes in February and appears to be " on full song " well before
leaving. Often many birds in a small area, but each usually appearing
to be indifferent to its neighbours.
Wood-warbler. --On Malta, where this species is common on passage
from late April to mid-May, the birds were invariably travelling in
pairs, or at least two birds together in closest company and taking
great care not to become separated. I do not recall having noticed
this with birds seen at Tobruk and Gazala at the same time of year, but
it is quite possible that owing to the intense congestion of migrant birds
in limited areas, and perhaps also to having less opportunity to spend
much time in bird-watching, it would have escaped my attention.
Spotted Flycatcher. --Very abundant both on spring and autumn
passage. Often many in same area but no signs of the birds deliberately
associating. Utters a low, soft warbling song in Malta in May when
large numbers pass through.
Red-backed Shrike .--Extremely abundant in autumn (late August-end
September) on the Egyptian coast. In September, 1942, the transit
camp at Ameriya was literally swarming with these birds. Every small
tangle of barbed wire was being used as an ersatz bush by anything
up to half a dozen Shrikes. A near-by tract of cultivated land with
palms and olive trees was even more crowded, and here the birds were
wreaking great havoc among the Wood Warblers, Lesser White-
throats, and other small fry. I have only seen one of these birds in
Egypt on the spring migration and never one on Malta at any time.
Woodchat Shrike. --Common, though never so abundant as the fore-
going species, in all three countries on both migrations. In Malta
appears early in August, but several were seen in July, the earliest
being a female on the 14th. In view of the fact that in the south of
France, and no doubt elsewhere, this bird is often still feeding young in
August I was greatly surprised never to see a single bird that showed
any traces of juvenile plumage. Birds always seen singly, though at
times several in same area, though never so congested as most birds,
even in desert wadis. I never saw this species attack any small birds or
any signs that one had done so.

180 D. GOODWIN-NOTES ON WINTER AND PASSAGE MIGRANTS
Lesser Grey Shrike .--As Red-backed, but less numerous and gave the
impression of being less, if at all, destructive to the smaller birds
about it.
Quail .--Very common on passage in Egypt, slightly less so in Libya
and Malta. Have no worthwhile observation of this bird at large,
except that when coming in from over the sea it does not always alight
exhausted near the shore, but at times flies straight on inland at a fair
height. In captivity a most delightful little bird, incredibly tame and
confiding. Said to be wild when in aviaries in Europe, but from the
behaviour of birds in the Zoo at Giza which were in a very large
aviary, and of those that I kept under very adverse conditions I can
safely say that such is not the typical behaviour of the bird that passes
through Egypt, but, of course, others may be different. There is little
need to more than briefly mention the wholesale exploitation that goes
on in Egypt when this little bird pays his bi-annual visits. Englishmen
living in the country abhor the massacre of the trammel nets and having
waxed lyrical over the cruelty of the impoverished natives engaged in
the business, take down their twelve-bores and go out to harry those
that have got past in safety !
Sparrow Hawk .--A few seen at Gyrene in January and one on Malta.
Common in Lower Egypt in winter, where the bird hunts quite as
often by cruising along at tree-top height and dashing down at an
oblique angle when some potential victim meets its eye, as by the
" hedge-hopping " tactics more usually favoured by the species in
Britain. Always solitary.
Lesser Kestrel .--Common passage migrant on Malta and some seen
at Gazala in late April. May well be very common in Libya but
difficult to distinguish at a distance from Common Kestrel. In Malta
large numbers often seen in March when held up by adverse winds.
At such times it appears to be travelling in small parties that when
hunting spread themselves over a considerable area. On the
19th March, 1944, there was a large hold-up of these birds on Malta
and the local sportsmen were out in full force after them. One man
who had about thirty in his game-bag permitted me to look over them
and to my surprise I found that only three had the white claws that are
said by some authorities to be diagnostic of this species, the claws of
the majority being of a dull opaque horn colour. One of these birds
which I cut open had its stomach full of the chitinous portions of
beetles ; those seen in Libya were feeding on some very large hawk-
moth caterpillars, or rather catching them and then being chased and
robbed by seven Red-legged Kestrels that were in company with
them.
Hen and Pallid Harriers .--I identified both these species in Libya
and the former on Malta, but as in many cases I was not able to do
more than guess at the identity of the bird I was watching I must ask

D. GOODWIN-NOTES ON WINTER AND PASSAGE MIGRANTS l8l
my readers' apologies for lumping them together. They are common in
winter in Libya and Egypt and I think are also passage migrants ;
indeed, in the latter country I am not at all sure from what I saw that
the same birds are present throughout the winter. The birds sweep
along, swift and fairly low over the desert, in their matchless flight and
suddenly dash down to seize, or miss, some bird on the ground. An
amusing, if rather cruel, spectacle is the frequent one of a Harrier
trying to drive smaller birds out of some bush or clump of tamarisk,
flapping over it in a state of great excitement, rising and dropping to
snatch angrily at the bush-top with its claws, usually with no result
other than to elicit a chorus of scolding maledictions if some Red-
backed Shrikes happen to be among the refugees. On one occasion
I was watching a Short-toed Lark only a few yards away when suddenly
it crouched and froze ; and the next second I had the shock of my
life when a male Hen Harrier shot past my face, snatched up the poor
Lark in one foot and was away before I fairly realized what had taken
place.
Turtle Dove .--Common in spring (mid-April-June) in all three
countries, but have never seen it in Malta in the autumn so suppose
that the birds normally pass over the island at night on the latter
migration. Generally in small parties of from three to twenty birds,
often great numbers present in a suitable resting or feeding place.
Single birds, usually juveniles, not infrequent in Libya in autumn.
Much persecuted by the natives on Malta and by European sportsmen
in Egypt. Said to be paired at the time of the spring migration. I
never saw any evidence of this but of course it is quite possible that
some contact may be kept up by paired birds even when travelling in
company with others and the behaviour of captive birds in winter
certainly gives colour to this idea.
Swallow .--Extremely numerous everywhere on passage in spring
and autumn. Often fails to give an impression of numbers till one
realizes, with a start, that for the best part of the day there has seldom
been less than two or three birds in sight slipping past a given point.
I remember clearly to have seen Swallows in Libya in February, but
having lost my notebooks I have no knowledge of the exact date, the
earliest record I have for Malta is 6th March, a single bird, in company
with House Martins. April and early May probably sees the greatest
number passing through but one may see plenty of birds still going
north in June, and a few even in July in Egypt, although where such
laggards find time to breed--if they do so at all--is a bit of a mystery.
Frequently birds will dally to sweep back and forth over a likely
feeding ground and at times they appear to stay for at least some days
in one vicinity. Usually in company, but when travelling seriously
with no mind to loiter and feed on the way, the birds usually fly in very
loose formation, strung out in twos and threes, and single birds are

commonly seen. Swallows on migration appear always to fly very low,
barely skimming the ground as a rule, but it may be that such birds
are more easily seen than others that fly higher.
When dust-laden winds have cut off the insect supply I have often
seen Swallows endeavouring to seize Painted Lady butterflies flushed
by people walking through low desert scrub, although at other times
these insects are ignored. When, under such circumstances, I forced
the large cicadas to take wing by throwing them into the air, the short
bills of the Swallows prevented them from capturing such prey in
spite of their efforts to do so ; the Spotted Flycatchers, on the other
hand, not only were able to hold and carry them off, but were, to my
surprise, far more dexterous at intercepting them in the air than the
longer-winged birds. Like the Bee-eaters and Swifts, the Swallows are
day-migrants whereas most of the other small birds appear to travel
chiefly at night and rest and feed during the day. In the desert I
have seen them at dusk enter a large covered vehicle again and again,
but finding no roosting perch near the roof, and being, no doubt, too
afraid of the human occupants to settle lower they finally alighted on
the bare sand a little way away.
Sand Martin or Bank Swallow .--As Swallow, but not seen so early or
late in spring, not so numerous, and so far as I can recall no single
birds were seen. In Egypt impossible to give any worthwhile data,
since this species breeds there in great numbers, arriving at its breeding
grounds in February, and I frankly cannot identify the two races in the
field except from their behaviour.
House Martin .--Although I saw these birds in all three countries on
both migrations I was struck by the very small number seen--probably
not more than 150 in four and a half years--compared to the vast
numbers of Swallows and Bank Swallows seen. The only single bird
ever seen was also the earliest, 21st February, in Valetta, on Malta.
Usually in small flocks, keeping more closely together than Swallows
do, and very often in company with them. It would be rather
interesting to know if this bird suffers as much at the hands of house-
proud people and that amiable bird Phillip Sparrow in other parts
of its range as it does in this country.
Kingfisher .--A few seen on Malta and on the Libyan coast near
Tobruk. Common in Egypt in the winter, and being seldom if ever shot
at is not shy and nervous as in Britain, but can be watched from a few
yards without evincing any alarm and is, indeed, tamer than the
resident Pied Kingfisher.
Lapwing .--Common in the Nile Delta in winter, often on same
feeding grounds as Spurwing Plovers, but have had little opportunities
for observing it. Large flocks present on upland fields near Cyrene in
January and February. Only two seen on Malta were on an expanse
of muddy ground near a pool on the 20th of January.

D. GOODWIN-NOTES ON WINTER AND PASSAGE MIGRANTS 1 83
Dotterel. --Many seen in the Western Desert during the winter
months. Generally in small parties that appeared to remain quiescent
by day, but flying about a great deal at dusk, low over the desert, at
which time frequently seen in pairs. Contrary to the birds' reputation,
I found them not particularly easy to approach, and certainly much
wilder than the Cream-coloured Courser, which they much resemble
in gait and appearance, and lacking that bird's boldness and
" 'saitable curiosity ".
Ringed Plover. --Several of these birds were present at the edge of a
pool near Malleha, on Malta, from 25th March until 18th May,
when the pool was almost completely dried up and only one bird was
present. In the interim the pool was visited at least once a week and
from five to nine birds were always to be seen. On the 11 th April and
several times subsequently a display was seen in which a cock (?)
would pursue a hen (?) with his body feathers puffed out and tail
spread fanwise in what was obviously a ceremonial chase.
Little Ringed Plover. --Seen throughout winter months in Egypt and
Libya, but did not have the chance to keep individuals under observa-
tion, so uncertain whether winter or passage migrants. Rarely two or
three together, more often a single bird at the edge of some pond or
ditch. Trustful and unsuspicious as a Crested Lark, I frequently
walked to within a few yards of one and watched it without evoking
the least alarm and on one occasion I saw a bird at the edge of a tiny
pool at the side of the readjust outside Tobruk that was feeding, with
the utmost indifference towards the stream of men and vehicles con-
stantly passing within a few feet of it.
Green Sandpiper. --Common in Egypt in winter and several seen in
spring and autumn in Libya and Malta that were judged to be on
passage. Usually singly, but on more that one occasion have come upon
one in company with a single Common Sandpiper. Haunts the edges
of irrigation ditches in Egypt and when disturbed usually only flies a
short distance, but elsewhere is more nervous and once alarmed into
taking flight towers up uttering its wild, sweet " tu-lee ! tu-lee ! " and
either flies right away or circles round for some time before re-
alighting.
Common Sandpiper. --One or two only seen in Libya and Egypt, but
several on Malta in autumn at some salt pans near St. Paul's Bay,
sometimes in company with the previous species. Large numbers seen
on the coast near Malleha (Malta) between the middle of March and
end of April. These latter were always found singly among the tumbled
boulders above high-water mark, and when flushed would fly out low
over the sea and, describing a half circle, re-alight among the rocks
further ahead. A large freshwater pool a short distance away that
attracted Wood and Curlew Sandpipers as well as other waders was,
so far as I was able to observe, never visited by this species.

<bodyText confidence="0.980361045454546" page_id="56289298"  page_num="184" year="" vol="">
Curlew Sandpiper .--Four seen on Malta, at the pool near Malleha,
on the 22 nd April, one nearly in full summer plumage and three in
winter dress. On the 29th the same birds (?) were there, two now
showing a good deal of summer plumage, but one still in nearly com-
plete winter plumage. On the 6th May all four were in breeding
plumage. If these were the same four birds, as seems very likely, the
remarkably quick assumption of summer plumage was perhaps partly
due to optical illusion, as the birds were, of course, not minutely
examined in the hand and had they been they, no doubt, would have
proved to be much further advanced in the moult when first seen than
they appeared in the field. On the 18th May nine birds were on the
mud at the edge of the very little water not yet dried up. Five were in
summer plumage, one in intermediate plumage, and three, to my
surprise, appeared to be in full winter dress, without any rufous
feathers showing.
Purple Heron .--One wonders if this bird was named by the same
person who bestowed their rather misleading titles on the White
Wagtail and Red-rumped Ghat ? At all events, whoever did so seems
to have been equally colour-blind !
This bird is seen on passage in Malta in both spring and autumn.
Most, I think, fly over without alighting, particularly the adults in
autumn, but others settle to rest and are frequently shot. The bird's
habit of perching in the middle of a fig or other thick tree, from which
it can seldom instantly extricate itself when alarmed, probably
adds greatly to the hazards which are always considerable for any
large bird that attempts to loiter on this veritable death-trap of an
island.
Little Egret .--This bird is to be seen in parties in the spring migration
on Malta. Those that stop to rest usually select to do so on some rock
or rocks jutting out of the sea at the foot of the cliffs and so are less
liable to meet death at man's hand than the other Herons. I once saw
a single bird of this species in the desert near Gazala (Libya) that was
standing on the bare ground looking absolutely done in, though it
took wing in a tired manner when I approached. This was either in
March or April, but I have now no clue to the precise date. This bird
is a common breeding species in Egypt, nesting among the Buff-
backed Egrets, so that whether any birds seen in that country were
migrants I am unable to say.
In order to spare our long-suffering Editor too tedious a screed I
have, in the above article, dealt only with those birds which I was able
to make most observations on, and with a slight bias towards well-
known British species, so will conclude with a list of the other migrants
seen, each bird being followed by the initial letter of the country where
observed. If any reader would care for further information on such

Having discovered a pair of Nightjars near my home at Keston,
Kent, in mid-May and studied them through the season, I venture to
give my observations, in the hope that some of our members may be
interested. Keston is well known for its lakes and majestic oaks, one
historical tree being in Holwood Park, seat of Lord Derby, under
which sat Wilberforce and Pitt, who talked and decided on the
abolition of the slave trade in 1788. One fine May afternoon I was
strolling past the lakes, camera in hand, making my way to Padmill
woods to take a snap of five young Blackbirds I had discovered a week
earlier. On reaching the edge of the wood I secured a snap of the
youngsters and proceeded to a clearing by a silver birch tree to listen
for Whitethroats, Blackcaps, and Wrens.

1 86 P. W. BEAUCHAMP-OBSERVATIONS ON A PAIR OF NIGHTJARS
Suddenly, from a distant oak, a large brown bird swooped low over
the bracken, uttering a peculiar quick cawing sound, punctuated by a
sound of repeated light whip cracks and I knew I had seen a Night-
jar. As I walked over to the oak, keenly watching, suddenly out flew
a second bird, showing light markings on its wings, giving sharp
cracks as it flew, this then was the male. Should this be their chosen
breeding spot, these birds would not return for some time, so I decided
to visit the locality a few days later and watch for signs of their feeding.
Nightjars usually take their main meals in the long summer evenings,
flying around large oak trees, continually collecting every kind of
moth and large winged insect. My next visit being an evening one,
I approached cautiously and sat down beneath the silver birch nearest
to the oak from which I had seen the Nightjar leave a few days ago.
It is almost impossible to spot a Nightjar perched in a tree as they
have the exceptional habit of resting along the bough, seldom, if ever,
perching across a branch ; as it alights, the bird immediately turns
lengthwise and so cannot be seen from underneath, as no part of the
body or tail protrudes.
Several birds were in the air, but I was listening for the quick caw
note or wing crack. These birds look somewhat like Hawks, but
differ entirely in their mode of flight. From my observation spot I
soon heard and saw first one then the other Nightjar leave the oak
tree and circle round, this went on for ten minutes ; finally the pair
disappeared into the thick foliage of the oak, several more flights being
made at intervals until dusk.
My next evening visit was at the end of May, and from my spot
under the birch tree I soon discovered one Nightjar on his moth
gathering ; this evidently being the male, as the light markings showed
on the wings, but there was no sign of the hen. I was now quite
excited, as this indicated the hen might be near at hand, possibly
incubating. Out came the male for a second fly round the tree and,
as it alighted again after a lengthy spell, up into the tree went the hen
from the ground, only about fifty feet from me ; so the bird had
evidently chosen a nesting site. I tried to pin-point the spot from which
the Nightjar hen had risen, but although I stepped very carefully
there was no sign of any eggs. Nightjars never attempt to construct
a nest, not even a dried root, blade of grass, or feather, but just lay
their two eggs in a depression on the bare ground. Knowing the risk
of stepping on the eggs I decided to make sure of the spot before I
ventured to explore. As half an hour passed and no hen returned it
seemed almost certain no eggs had been laid.
On my next visit, about a week later, I approached the site
cautiously and did not flush the hen until about three yards from her,
I immediately surveyed the spot, tip-toeing carefully, and was
rewarded by seeing two eggs side by side, in a slight depression near

trailing blackberry and bracken. Nightjars' eggs are indeed most hand-
some. They are about the size of the domestic Bantam egg, but the
shape is oval at both ends, not pointed at one end as is usual with
bird eggs. The ground colour is white, with most wonderful streaks of
purple, blue, and brown. (I have a snap of this pair of eggs.)
Nature seems unkind not to protect the eggs or chicks, as these are
open to any maundering stoat or weasel, also Jays and such birds,
and are easily stepped upon by anyone walking through the woods.
After paying many visits to watch the Nightjars I was eventually
rewarded by finding, on the twenty-first day, two lovely chicks about
two days old. Although covered in a soft brown down the chicks
resembled Dabchicks, but markings similar to the adult Nightjars
were very pronounced even before any sign of feathers. Each time I
approached the chicks the hen seemed to wait until I was only a yard
away, when she would fly up into the oak tree, uttering her purring
note repeatedly. Only occasionally did I observe the male fly out and
around but not once did he approach the nest. When about a week
old, I found the chicks could move around, in fact they were two feet
from the depression containing the discarded egg-shells and hiding
under some bracken. On my next visit I had difficulty in finding
the babies, although the hen flew up, only one chick was found after a
diligent search, and this was still further away from the original spot.
This one chick, at eight days old, had made remarkable progress, its
feathers were forming and the body defined. Alas, on my visit two days
later, no sign of the youngster or the parents could be found. So ended
my observation on this pair of Nightjars, but it gave me much food for
thought, either the young bird matured quickly or was lured further
away each day by the parents moving to other oak trees.
Being now the end of June, I did not expect the birds to return,
for although a second nest often follows before migration, if disturbed
they may find a new site. Many interesting points are worth noting
about the Nightjar. It is a bird of some ioj in. in length, it has a long,
tapered body and tail, the wings are also long, reaching well down the
tail and shaped rather like those of the Swallow. The head is elongated
and appears to merge into the shoulders, it has a small bill but a very
large gape reaching the width of the head. The upper and lower
mandibles are broad and pointed and from each side of the upper
hangs a row of hairs. From this study of the Nightjar I feel sure it will
be agreed that the bird has many interesting features, its build, method
of resting, flight, feeding, nesting habits, and rearing of young. I do
not know of any other birds possessing such contrasts in their general
make-up and habits.
One problem I have not solved, what happens should a thunder-
storm break, as often occurs in midsummer, over a pair of eggs or
chicks, on ground in such a slight depression of exposed woodland,

The seventh meeting of the Club was held at the Rembrandt Hotel,
Thurloe Place, South Kensington, S.W. 7, on Wednesday, 10th Septem-
ber, 1947, at 6 p.m., followed by a dinner.
Chairman : Miss P. Barclay-Smith.

Members of the Club, 23 ; guests, 10 ; total, 33.
Mr. P. W. Beauchamp, Hon. Secretary, National British Softbill
Society, gave an instructive talk entitled " British Softbills in Cage
and Aviary ". The keeping of these birds under all conditions was
reviewed. The point most stressed was that to maintain them in
perfect health sufficient space for free wing exercise is absolutely
essential.
Mr. C. S. Webb, Curator-Collector, Zoological Society of London,
gave a very interesting account of the collection he brought back
from his recent visit to British Guiana. The collection consisted of
nearly 200 mammals, birds, and reptiles. Amongst the birds were
two Venezuelan Wood Rails, one Black-spotted Barbet, one Whiteley's
Emerald Humming Bird, and one Golden-headed Manakin--four
species new to the Regent's Park collection. In addition, there were
Hawk-headed Parrots, Sulphur-and-white-breasted Toucans, Banded
Aracarias, a Harpy Eagle, two White-bellied Humming Birds, and
many others. Mr. Webb said that he was disappointed in being able
to bring only three Humming Birds. Care of the mammals had
demanded so much of his time that he was left with little to devote
to the capture of birds. He had, however, made what he believed
was a hitherto unpublished observation. The Cayenne Hermit

Humming Bird had always been regarded as a more or less solitary
bird, but in a small clearing he had seen a gathering of thirty or more.
They were making a noise not unlike so many crickets: and dissection
of the several specimens obtained pointed to the fact that probably
the assembly consisted of males only. Aviculture in Georgetown and
the habits of the Hoatzin were briefly described.
The Chairman proposed votes of thanks to the speakers, and they
were warmly applauded.
After the Loyal Toast the Chairman announced that the Club was
honoured in having as official guests the new Director of the British
Museum (Natural History), Mr. N. B. Kinnear, and his daughter
Miss Elizabeth Kinnear. She was sure she was voicing the desire not
only of members of the Club, but of the whole Avicultural Society,
in wishing to congratulate Mr. Kinnear on his appointment.
Mr. Kinnear was one of those rare people who, no matter how busy,
was always willing to give help; he never looked for thanks and was
always anxious to give credit to other people. To-night, however,
Mr. Kinnear was in a position where he could not do the last named.
When the British Aviculturists' Club first started it was realized that
to make it a success it must have a good send off, so Mr. Kinnear
was asked to speak at the first meeting. Despite being extremely
busy, Mr. Kinnear acceded to this request and gave a most interesting
paper on the oldest known stuffed African Grey Parrot. Since then
the Club had not looked back, and this success was undoubtedly in
large part due to the help given by Mr. Kinnear. In addition
Mr. Kinnear had now brought honour to ornithology as a whole,
for it was the first time that an ornithologist had been appointed to
the high position of Director of the Natural History Museum. Miss
Barclay-Smith asked Mr. Kinnear to accept the warm congratulations
of the members, their best wishes for the future, and their most sincere
gratitude for all he had done for the Club, and gave the toast " The
Director of the British Museum (Natural History) and Miss Elizabeth
Kinnear ", which was carried with acclamation. Mr. Kinnear
replied saying how much he appreciated the toast and thanked the
members for their good wishes.
The next meeting is at 6 p.m. on 12th November, 1947.

NATURE LOVER. The Magazine of the Countryside. (Staples Press,
Ltd. Monthly, is. 3 d.)
This is by no means a new publication--it was published for some
years before the war--but it has only recently been revised in a new
monthly form.
It should commend itself to all who take an interest in the never-
ending variety of the countryside. If succeeding numbers maintain the
high level of the first there is little doubt that it will prove an
exceedingly useful and informative journal. The present intention is
that each number shall consist of fifty-two pages, twelve of which are
to be of art paper for illustrations. The wide scope of the magazine
may be gathered from the titles of the principal articles in the July
number : " The Unity of Nature," C. Henry Warren ; " Secretive
Badgers," B. Melville Nicholas ; " The British Fritillary Butterflies,"
L. Hugh Newman; "Jimmy the Lizard," Frances Pitt; "The
Numbers of Animals," Brian Vesey-Fitzgerald ; " The Water Pro-
blems of Fishes," Chapman Pincher ; " How Odd ! " (Some strange
plant habits), Wolseley Banks ; " Bird-watching on an East Coast
Estuary," Robin H. Harrison ; " Lavenham, Suffolk," Geoffrey
Morgan ; Book Reviews. There are numerous excellent photographs
to illustrate the articles, and sketches by Roland Green of Black-
tailed Godwits, Oyster-catchers, Turnstone, Dunlin, and Ringed

Additions to the London Zoo.
June , 1947 .--The registered additions for the month were forty-three. The most
important were four Kentish Plovers ( Charadrius alexandrinus) --a species new to the
collection, these were received in exchange from the Copenhagen Zoo together with
two Lapwings ( Vanellus vanellus ) ; three Ruffs ( Philomachus pugnax ) ; two Ringed
Plovers (Charadrius hiaticula) ; two Grey Plovers (Squatarola squatarola) ; one Turnstone
Arenaria {interpres) ; one Common Sandpiper ( Tringa hypoleucos) ; two Oyster-catchers
(.Hamatopus ostralegus) . Other arrivals were one Green-billed Toucan ( Ramphastos
dicolorus ) ; two White Storks {Ciconia ciconia) and two White-fronted Geese (Aners
albifrons, race inc.) from Greenland, the last-named have since been transferred to
Whipsnade. Two Black-footed Penguins ( Spheniscus demersus) and one Night Heron
{Nycticorax nycticorax) were bred in the Gardens. The bird registered in April as a
Booted Eagle ( Hieraaetus pennatus) has since been renamed Ayres' Hawk-Eagle
(.Hieraaetus ayresi ).
There was a tragedy of a very unusual nature at the beginning of the month. A
male Emu was found lying dead in its paddock. The cause was immediately apparent
as in the same enclosure was its neighbour, a female One-wattled Cassowary. The
Cassowary had torn a hole in the dividing fence and had attacked the Emu with such
ferocity that it had died from injuries and shock. The two birds had been neighbours
for some ten years, as the Emu, who lost its mate in a flying-bomb incident, had been
in the Gardens since 1932, and the Cassowary since 1938.
July, 1947. The additions for the month numbered one hundred and thirty-three.
An important collection was brought home from British Guiana by Mr. C. S. Webb,
which included four species new to the Collection. The more interesting arrivals
were : one Bates's Fire Finch {Lagonosticta rubricata virata) * from Kulikoro, French

Bird Skins collected by John Whitehead
On the recent death of an aged aunt of mine a cardboard box arrived for me
which proved to contain some stuffed specimen birds which had been collected about
sixty years ago by my Uncle John Whitehead, who in his day was a very well known
field naturalist and explorer, and incidentally the discoverer of the monkey-eating
Eagle, Pithecophaga jefferyi, which, like so many of his birds, was named after my
grandfather.
Most of his choicest specimens were purchased by Lord Rothschild and housed
in the museum at Tring, and have, I believe, gone to America. I propose to offer
the few specimens that have just come into my possession to the British Museum,
but before doing so I thought that a short note on them might perhaps be of interest
to readers of the Avicultural Magazine.
When I unwrapped them I was amazed at the marvellous brilliance of their
colouring after sixty years. Most of them might have been shot yesterday. Each
bears a small label and they are as follows :--

<listItem confidence="0.8780304" page_id="56289306"  page_num="192" year="" vol="">

Prionochinis xanthophygus (Lawas River, N.W. Borneo) ; (7) one Pericrocotus xanthogaster ;
(8) one Cyanoptila cyanomelana. %
Presumably many of these Latin names have been changed since those days.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.991117085714286" page_id="56289306"  page_num="192" year="" vol="">
However, even without reference to names, the Pittas (1), the Pintailed Nonpareils(4),
the Hunting Cissa (3), the gorgeous Scarlet Minivet (7) were easily recognized,
and (8) is obviously a Niltava, and a very beautiful one too, dark blue back and
wings with brilliant cobalt blue cap, black throat, and white belly ; (5) and (6)
are very small and I should think Fruit-peckers. (5), a male, is chiefly blue-black,
greenish-yellow on the rump, with yellow belly, scarlet throat, and a narrow scarlet
crest patch ; (6), a female, is dull dark green above and yellowish beneath.
Quite the loveliest of them all, and the one which almost more than any of them
made me long to possess again some of the rare and beautiful birds one had before
the war is (2), a gorgeous Shrike, displaying all the brilliant colours one normally
associates with the Parrot family. The back and wings shining dark green with
blue and black in the flights. Tail vivid darkish blue. Upper breast emerald green
merging into pale blue on the belly. Head black, with white stripe over the eye,
white nuchal collar, and narrow turquoise blue crest patch. Throat bright orange
yellow.
It is strange that few if any of these lovely tropical Shrikes ever seemed to figure
in pre-war collections, but I suppose feeding them on the journey to Europe was
considered the difficulty, yet how well worth bringing over they would have been
and how their few fortunate possessors would have prized them !
Also in the box was a letter, dated July, 1905, from Mr. O'Brien-Butler, the then
British Consul in Chefoo, China, to Mr. Ogilvie-Grant, of the British Museum,
enclosing two photographs, taken by a missionary of my Uncle's lonely looking
grave in Hainan. And another letter from Mr. Ogilvie-Grant to my grandfather
sending him the photos of " poor John's grave ".
John Whitehead spent the whole of his tragically short life risking life and limb
and health in discovering, collecting, and cataloguing for the first time the birds
and mammals of Borneo and the Philippine Islands ; in making the first scientific
exploration of Mount Kina Balu to its very summit, and in penetrating localities
where no white man had ever set foot before.
It is perhaps hardly to be wondered at that he died at the early age of 37 of Black-
water fever, but he was a great field naturalist and his death was a grievous loss to
natural science.
He died, I think, about the year I was born (1902), and it has always been a
sorrow to me that, of all my mother's brothers, he was the only one I never knew.

The Tropical House at the London Zoo
Members who have not recently visited the London Zoo will be pleased to learn
that the Tropical House has just been reopened. War damage necessitated almost
total reconstruction and this has been done with such success that one wishes the
building could also have been considerably enlarged. Everyone concerned in the
matter is deserving of all praise. Space permits only the briefest description. To the
left of the centre passage there are three large aviaries, complete with pools and very
naturally arranged vegetation. At present the first is occupied by a Brown-eared
Bulbul, Green-tailed Bristle-bill Bulbul, Maroon Tanager, and Rothschild's Grackle ;
No. 2, a Senegal Touraco and pairs of Superb Glossy Starlings, Wattled Starlings,
and Avocets ; No. 3, Golden Hangnest, Red-eared Bulbul, African Golden Oriole,
Verreaux's Amethyst Starling, and a pair of Ringed Plovers.
The right-hand side is divided into eight compartments, in the first of which are
a Blue-throated Brown Sunbird and a Yellow-whiskered Bulbul, followed by a pair
of Yellow-winged Sugar Birds ; White-bellied Emerald Humming Bird and Golden-
headed Manakin ; Hardwick's Fruitsucker ; another White-bellied Emerald
Humming Bird ; Violet Tanager and two Willow Warblers ; a pair of Black-
headed Sugar Birds ; four Tree Pipits and three Yellow Wagtails.

Ocellated Turkey.
According to information in Bruno Duerigen's book Gejiuegelzucht, the Ocellated
Turkey has been bred in the Berlin Zoo many years ago. It must have been in 1884 or
1885. This is long ago, but I clearly remember having seen these birds at about that
time, when I was taken to the Berlin Zoo as a small boy. Duerigen does not mention
whether the birds grew up to maturity. Probably this was not the case. Also, the
hybrids which Professor Ghigi, Bologna bred with the Common or Wild Turkey did
not live for a long time. This breeder gives a very interesting account about the bird in
his little book Tachini e Galline di Pharaone (Turkeys and Guineafowls) ". In order to
obtain the much coveted bird Professor Ghigi sent a Dr. Taibel to Honduras. Dr.
Taibel stayed about six months in Honduras and reared a number of young Ocellated
Turkeys either caught as chicks or hatched from eggs collected by natives and hatched
under hens, but finally only landed two hens in Italy. Mr. Spedan-Lewis' success
is really outstanding. He might still have better results if the eggs would be entrusted
to the mother bird or to a light Common Turkey hen, and when the weather is fine
mother and chickens ought to have free range in a sheltered orchard where there
never has been other poultry.

A " Birds of Prey " Special Number.
It has been suggested that a special Birds of Prey number of the Avicultural
Magazine be published. Though comparatively few aviculturists have kept speci-
mens of this group of birds, it is much hoped that it will be possible to secure sufficient
material to produce such a number. The Editor will be glad to receive articles from
anyone who has kept Owls, Eagles, Hawks, and Falcons, etc., and it is also proposed
to include such birds as Raven, Crow, Rook, Magpie, and Jackdaw.

THE STATUS OF WILD PHEASANTS IN THE FAR EAST
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984214217391304" page_id="56289308"  page_num="194" year="" vol="">
The special Pheasant number of the Avicultural Magazine contains some
interesting statements on the alleged impact of the war in the Far East on resident
stocks of wild Pheasants.
On p. 113, Mr. Weaver writes :--
" The war in the Far East has no doubt had its effect on wild stock, driving these
wary creatures still further into the impenetrable jungles and mountain fastnesses,
whilst some species may have been virtually exterminated."
On p. 123, Mr. Lambert writes :--
" It is probably correct to state that Pheasants, referring to the many varieties and
species spread throughout Asia, the Far East, Malaya, etc., suffered more losses than
any other birds during the war years. I am not in a position to make a positive state-
ment regarding Pheasant life in Asia and elsewhere, but one has little cause to call
on one's imagination to surmise that the toll taken in India, China, and Japan must
and will be colossal."
In support of his surmise, Mr. Lambert quotes a letter from a friend in India,
dated 1945, which states that the Indian native has developed a keen sense in the
killing of many species of pheasants for the pot, the only form of game bird mentioned,
however, being the Common Peafowl.
The effects of war on bird life is an interesting subject and one concerning which
little is known. Furthermore, the statements which I have quoted are likely to be
repeated, parrot fashion, in the Avicultural Mazagine and perhaps elsewhere.
It would, therefore, be most useful if Messrs. Weaver and Lambert would expand
on this theme and in particular supply the following information :--

Peafowl for the pot.
I am particularly interested because I have spent the past seven years in various
parts of China, India, Ceylon, and Malaya, and I am quite unable to confirm the
surmises which I have quoted. I am, in fact, of the opinion that the reverse is the
truth. During the war years, sporting ammunition was entirely unprocurable in China
and the Japanese-occupied areas and was only available in very small quantities,
strictly controlled, in India. Relatively little shooting was done either by Asiatics
or Europeans. Wasteful trapping by native bird catchers for the live bird trade was
eliminated and the trade in frozen Pheasants from China, which was probably the
largest source of destruction numerically, has been in abeyance ever since 1937. I
know of no evidence that there has been a sudden increase during the war years of
killing birds for eating purposes on the part of native populations in Asia.
It is true that during the course of the fighting large quantities of Japanese and
Allied weapons came into the possession of unauthorized persons, particularly in
Burma, but they were used and are being used for political purposes, not for sport and
shooting for the pot. In any case, very few of the weapons were suitable for shooting
birds.
It is also true that the fighting around Kohima and Imphal partly took place within
the range of Hume's Pheasant, but there was no fighting over large, continuous fronts.
Birds may have been locally and temporarily affected in those areas where heavy
engagements were fought, but I doubt if there is any evidence even of this. Or is it
seriously suggested that Pheasants were slaughtered in large numbers by the Japanese
or our own troops ? Does one have cause to call on one's imagination to think of the
boys of the 14th Army relentlessly pursuing the elusive Pheasant, suitably armed, I

suppose, with Stens and P.I.A.T.s ? What other cases are there of heavy fighting in
China or South East Asia taking place in localities where Pheasants commonly occur ?
The collapse of Japan may have affected the status of Japanese Pheasants, but from
what I hear of general conditions there it is most unlikely.
If the Avicultural Magazine is going to be filled with surmise, let it at least be
detailed surmise. I hate to think of the horrors of war overcoming such winsome avian
gems as the perky Golden, the aristocratic Lady Amherst, and particularly the proud,
disdainful Silver, but I should like a few more details before I start to shed any tears
over such tragic, but apparently hypothetical, war losses.

BREEDING OF THE RED-FACED LOVEBIRD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996169790697675" page_id="56289309"  page_num="195" year="" vol="">
I was interested to read Mr. Alex. Hampe's letter in the July-August number of
the Magazine with regard to the reputed successful breeding of Agapornis pullarius
by Mr. Eduard Spelle, as I myself came very near to successfully breeding these
difficult Lovebirds just before the war.
While one cannot doubt Mr. Spelle's repeated assurance that it was the Red-faced
and not the Peach-faced Lovebird that he bred, one cannot but be surprised at the
manner of their breeding. Firstly, Red-faced--unlike Peach-faced--do not, in my
experience, ever carry nesting material. Secondly, Red-faced Lovebirds in a wild
state nest, I believe, in burrows they make in Termite ant-heaps so that it is hardly
surprising that in an aviary pairs--even in breeding condition and presumably
anxious to nest--will usually completely ignore both natural hollow logs and nest
boxes. Their aversion to ordinary Lovebird nesting sites was most strikingly shown
by various pairs of these birds which the then Lord Tavistock used to have at liberty
at Warblington in the nineteen-twenties.
Peach-faced I know used to nest successfully at liberty because it was, if I remember
rightly, a pair of these birds which on one visit caused me such endless joy by having
a brood of young in a nest box hung under the eaves of the house just outside my
bedroom window. Yet Red-faced, with every nest box and tree in the garden to
choose from, never made the slightest attempt to breed. This puzzled me at the
time because one would have thought that being in full breeding condition, yet
deprived of their natural nesting sites, they would surely have succumbed to some
specially seductive hollow limb of the many trees at their disposal. That they ignored
ordinary nest boxes did not surprise me and I think Mr. Spelle must indeed have
been lucky to have obtained a pair of Red-faced so unorthodox as to nest in such a
box.
I thereupon conceived a hankering to breed them, but it was not until about 1937
that we were able to obtain two suitable pairs. Both pairs were, for their first season,
provided with various logs and nest boxes but, as I had expected--nothing doing.
So something more to their liking had to be devised. I then lit upon the idea of
giving them small " bales 53 of peat moss--compressed, just as one buys it. The
peat moss was cut into rectangular shapes measuring about 2 ft. long by 18 in. high
by 18 in. wide and each of these was enclosed in a close-fitting wooden box with
the top and one of the longest (2 ft.) sides removed, the whole being fixed to the
wooden back of the flight on metal brackets. Thus a certain amount of rain could
percolate through the top, and in front a bare 44 cliff face 55 as it were of compressed
peat moss was left exposed.
Almost at once the Red-faced Lovebirds evinced considerable interest in this
odd-looking nesting site and it was not long before a small hole appeared at the lower
part of the " bale ". At first I did not allow myself to indulge in wishful thinking
as I felt sure that that pest of Aviculturists--mice--must be responsible for the hole.
Then, shortly afterwards, I caught the female Lovebird busily tunnelling away, but
both pairs were extraordinarily secretive, and she immediately flew off into the
shelter as soon as she spotted me.

The tunnel progressed rapidly and soon the hen disappeared and was obviously
sitting. To make a long story short, the history of both pairs was more or less the
same. Pair number one had unfertile eggs, after which, as far as I can remember,
we parted with them. Pair number two also had unfertile eggs to begin with, but
the following year they had at least two eggs with fully formed young ones dead in
the shell.
This is as near as I ever got to breeding Red-faced Lovebirds and then the war
came along and we had to part with this promising couple. I was very sorry not to
have achieved complete success with them, if only because they have always seemed
to me quite the prettiest and most charming of all the Lovebird family.
By far the most interesting thing about this attempt to breed Red-faced Lovebirds
was the actual construction of the tunnel and the more or less egg-shaped nesting
chamber at the end of it. The tunnel itself went along for some inches horizontally,
then turned abruptly upwards and then doubled back on itself, so that the nesting
chamber was exactly above the entrance of the burrow.
When the bales of peat moss were cut open a similar arrangement of the tunnels
and nesting chambers was found in the case of both pairs of birds, so this would appear
to be their normal procedure. There was no " nest ", in the accepted Lovebird
sense, the eggs being laid on the bare peat moss, nor did I ever see either pair
attempting to carry nesting material.
It was at any rate interesting to have proved that Red-faced--so unlike other
Lovebirds as to their nesting arrangements--will nevertheless readily go to nest at
once provided they are given something suitable to burrow into.
I attribute the young dead in the shell mainly to lack of moisture, and another
time (though as far as I can see there is never likely to be another time !) I would
spray the peat moss regularly, put it in a shady position, and not just trust to rain
percolating through from the top.

THE EMPEROR GOOSE
(Anser canagicus)
By Peter Scott

<bodyText confidence="0.997876068965517" page_id="56289317"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
To me, the Emperor Goose is the most charming of all the wild
Geese. The Redbreast is more striking in plumage, the Pinkfoot is
more graceful, and the Ross's Goose more elegant. In spite of its
name it is not as stately as the Swan Goose, nor as autocratic as the
Canada Goose. But it has charm. I attribute this mainly to its
great friendliness--its companionable chirruping voice, the gentle
expression in its eye, and the whole amiability of its demeanour.
Emperors are nearly always tame in captivity, and most of the
Emperors I have known have been ready, sometimes a little over-
ready to take food from my hand.
Although the Emperor's grey, scalloped plumage is very handsome,
and the general colour scheme of white head, pink and blue bill,
black chin, and orange legs is extremely decorative, its figure (let's
face it) is homely--even dumpy. Its wings are short, indeed small
for a bird of its size, and it flies with a rapid wing beat for a goose.
But flight is less important to the Emperor than it is to most other
geese, for the migration route is short. The breeding grounds are
in Alaska on the marshes round the mouth of the Yukon and
Kuskokwim Rivers, and the wintering grounds are in Southern
Alaska and along the Aleutian chain.
In the wild state the Emperor Goose is essentially maritime in
its habitat, confining itself to salt water almost as consistently as the
Brent. It is said to feed on marine animals to a large extent, though
there is no indication of this ungooselike taste among specimens in
captivity.
In Alaska the Emperor usually breeds near the water of some
inland pond a few miles from the sea. The nest is often on a small
island or promontory and the eggs are laid at the end of May or in
early June. The female sits very tight, rising only at 10 or 15 feet

from an intruder. The male does not usually stand guard near the
nest as do the ganders of many other species, but as soon as the
goslings are hatched he joins them and helps to take care of them.
Although it seems to be locally fairly numerous in its northern
home, it is probably not a very large species. It is unlikely that
there are many more than thirty thousand Emperors in the world,
and there may be much less.
The Emperor is often placed in a genus of its own and is known
as Philacte canagica , but it is much more closely related to the Grey
Geese than it is to the Black Geese, and it should probably therefore
be included in the genus Anser in order to indicate this relationship.
Emperor Geese do well in captivity. But after the war there are
now no more than twenty-one of them in Europe, all of which are,
I believe, descended from the same stock. They breed fairly freely,
but the young are not as hardy as most geese, and require a good
deal of care and attention. This may be a symptom of inbreeding,
and it is possible that the introduction of fresh blood would make
them easier to rear.
It is to be hoped that the number of Emperors in collections in this
country will steadily increase. In any collection of waterfowl they are
bound to become favourites ; they are perfectly good natured with
other birds, delightfully tame and friendly, and, irrefutably, they
have charm.

In 1940 there were nearly 500 waterfowl at Cleres. All the known
species of geese, Sheldducks, and Tree Ducks were represented, also
all the ducks and swans with the exception of about twenty-five.
In 1945 practically nothing remained, all having been killed or
removed. A lonely Whooper Swan, a couple of Common Sheldducks,
a dozen or so hybrids between Mallards, Meller's, and Black Ducks,
some three-quarter-bred Yellow-bills, a few diving Ducks, which look
like a darker and more elongated Scaup (probably with White-eye
and Redhead blood), and oddly enough a male Sharp-winged Teal
and a female Bufflehead. According to Monsieur Georges Olivier
there were still a number of birds till the final slaughter in 1944, and
during the occupation Gape and Sharp-winged Teal had reared
broods on the lake.

In 1946 Mr. Spedan Lewis kindly presented us with a good collec-
tion : a pair of Black Swans, Emperor, Greater Snow, Magellan,
Ruddy-headed, Blue-winged Geese, South African Sheldducks, and
Red-crested Pochards. The Paris Zoo contributed Emperor, Red-
breasted, Bar-headed, Egyptian, and Cereopsis Geese and Mute and
Whooper Swans. Major Pam reared Blue Snow Geese for us.
Mandarins and Carolinas arrived from America, and others will
come this year, while Chiloe Wigeon, Rosy bills, Tufted and Bahama
Ducks, and Ashy-headed Geese are coming from Leckford, more
Ruddy-headed Geese from Foxwarren, more Bar-headed and Barnacle
from Wormley Bury, Paradise Sheldducks from Whipsnade, and
a couple of dozen species of the various European ducks from
Mr. Schuyl in Holland. Many species of course are, and will
long be, missing, particularly the Tree Ducks, now vanished from
Europe, and all the sea-ducks of which we used to keep such a
wonderful collection. But given peace and possible conditions in
France the collection will gradually be reformed. Of the geese we
now miss the Hawaiian Nene, of which the 42-year's-old male at Cleres,
inherited from the late Franz Blaauw, was the last representative in
Europe ; the Andeans which used to breed every year at Gleres ;
the Kelp Geese which never did well ; the Ross's Snows which always
bred freely ; the various races of Canadas which are easily obtained in
America ; the rare and interesting wild Chinese Swan Goose, of
which there were six goslings in 1940 ; the Orinoco and Maned
Geese, which still are kept in small numbers in California and the
less desirable Spur-wings and Semi-palmated.
My old breeding pair of Black-necked Swans, that for twenty years
reared their young at Cleres have naturally vanished, and the species is
now terribly scarce in captivity. But pairs of their offspring at Leckford
and in Holland, at Mr. Schuyl's, have bred this year, and I hope that,
later on, a new Black-necked menage will replace their grandoarents
in the pretty pool by the waterfall at the end of the lake, now tem-
porarily occupied by a handsome but vulgar pair of Mute Swans.
While I was in England last spring and summer I was delighted
to see how extraordinarily successful Mr. Terry Jones was at Leckford
in rearing young waterfowl. There were hundreds of ducklings,
many goslings, some cygnets, often the offspring of old worn-looking
pairs. If many interesting species have been saved for aviculture we
owe it to him.

The following is a brief list of the waterfowl found in Chile proper,
from Arica in the north to Aysen in the south. Many species range
further south and I have indicated this wherever possible.
I am familiar with most of the species as all the high altitude forms
also range into Peru, and I encountered most of the others when I
visited South Chile during the winter of 1938-9 expressly for the
purpose of collecting live waterfowl. During that trip, I was unable
to collect all the species which I wanted, but this paper may be of use
to anyone who may have the opportunity of making a similar trip in
the future.
I do not propose to give a detailed account of the geography of
Chile. The northern half is a strip of desert lying between the Andes
and the sea and almost entirely devoid of any waterfowl. The Andes
rise abruptly to the east and on the rolling moorlands of the upper
levels, above 12,000 ft. in the extreme north, and descending gradually
to about 6,000 in Central Chile (Aconcagua and Santiago), is the so-
called Puna Zone. This area is rich in waterfowl, the species being
mainly the same as in Peru. From about the latitude of Valparaiso
running south to Puerto Montt is the great central valley of Chile, a
narrow, fertile belt crossed by numerous rivers flowing from the
Andes. In the neighbourhood of Valparaiso the climate is of a
Mediterranean type, gradually becoming more humid until in Valdivia
and Llanquihue the climate resembles that of England or Western
Europe. There are a fair number of lakes and streams in the central
valley which contain waterfowl, and in the extreme south there is a
very beautiful lake region which is particularly rich in such birds.
There are, however, no moorland areas in the mountains here.
To the south of Puerto Montt there is heavy precipitation and the
rugged coast is covered with dense woodland. Immediately south of
Puerto Montt is the large island of Chiloe and further south still many
small islands, most of which are covered with thick tangles of scrub and
are uninhabited. Only sea-haunting waterfowl are found along the
coast. In the extreme south, in the Aysen region, it is possible to cross
the Andean divide into a very much drier region which is typically
Patagonian. The latter region stretches south to Tierra del Fuego.
A detailed account of the various zones may be found in The Birds of
Chile , by the late C. E. Hellmayr (Zoological Series, Vol. 19, Publica-
tion 308, Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago), published in
1932 .

During my own visit to Chile, apart from one excursion in the
neighbourhood of Santiago, I spent my whole time in the south, making
Puerto Montt my base. From there I visited the small town of Maullin,
forty miles to the west, which is situated on a broad estuary. I then
visited Ensenada, on the eastern shore of Lake Llanquihue, and
Peulla on Lake Todos los Santos. This was followed by a tour through
the northern part of Chiloe Island and a visit to Aysen. I then settled
down to a two-months' stay in Melinka, Guaitecas Islands, where I

Systematic List
Black-necked Swan ( Cygnus melancoriphus) .--This Swan occurs in
Southern Chile and Central Chile south to the Straits of Magellan, but
I never came across it.
Coscoroba Swan ( Coscoroba coscoroba). --Recorded as a rare winter

visitor to the central and southern provinces.
Andean Goose ( Chloephaga melanoptera) .--Found in the Puna zone
from extreme North Chile as far south as Malleco. I brought back
specimens from Peru in 1938. They are easy birds to bring over and
the young are readily hand-reared. In Peru the Indians often keep
tame specimens around the houses. The males are best confined
separately.
Ashy-headed Goose ( Chloephaga poliocephala) .--Ranges from
Colchagua south to the Straits of Magellan. I personally observed
them on mud flats near Maullin at the beginning of November, and
later in the same month I saw numbers on the open flats by the Peulla
river, which flows into Lake Todos los Santos. They were common in
Aysen in January, and I believe were breeding there and I
was brought one adult in moult, which could not fly, at Melinka at the
beginning of February. It appears to me that a new introduction of
blood is most desirable, since specimens now in this country seem to
be very undersized compared with wild birds.
Magellan Goose ( Chloephaga picta). --The Magellan has a similar
range to that of the Ashy-headed. I myself only saw it in Aysen, where
it was extraordinarily abundant in January and many pairs had young.
In some parts of Patagonia it is so abundant as to be regarded as a pest
by the sheep farmers.
Kelp Goose ( Chloephaga hybrida hybrida). --Recorded from Tierra del
Fuego to Valdivia, but I do not believe that it breeds north of Chiloe
Island. A sub-species, C. h. malvinarum , is found in the Falkland
Islands. It is a bird of rocky shores, where it feeds on a small sea weed
which grows along the tide line, called " Luche ". I saw many in the
Guaitecas Islands and in the channels between there and Aysen. I
had no difficulty in collecting a large number of live ones during my
stay in Melinka between the end of February and the middle of

March. I was brought many young ones of various sizes, and adults
in moult. In fact, the islanders were so eager that they brought me far
more than I wanted. They ate luche readily and were easy to keep
alive so long as supplies of that seaweed were available. Unfortunately,
luche is not an easy thing to preserve, though the islanders do dry small
quantities for food. It tends very quickly to overheat and go rotten
when kept in bags and should really be kept spread out. I had nearly
a ton when I started home with sixty birds, but I had to throw most of
it away in Puerto Montt, and after that gave the birds soaked biscuit
with a little luche. They also eat lettuce freely, but it is almost impos-
sible to store reasonable quantities for the voyage home. On the whole
they travel well and my few losses were primarily due to a form of heat
stroke while the ship was picking up cargo off North Chile. Some other
birds got fits of the " staggers ", continually throwing themselves over
backwards and moving their heads in a peculiar way. Most of the
birds affected in this way recovered after they arrived in England and
were provided with plenty of fresh green-food. Other birds got a form
of cramp during rough weather in the Bay of Biscay, but on the whole
I had few losses and do not regard Kelp Geese as being particularly
difficult subjects. They are naturally tame and are very active and can
hop from rock to rock. In this country they soon took to grazing like
normal Geese and but for the outbreak of the war would, in my
opinion, by now be well established, as I am sure they would breed
readily. Anyone who goes to South Chile for them must be prepared
for hard work. They must be transhipped twice, in Puerto Montt and
Valparaiso, and I personally believe that they could best be obtained
in the Falklands from where there are occasional direct sailings to
England and where there is no problem of foreign exchange.
Fulvous Tree-duck (. Dendrocygna bicolor). --Has been recorded from
the Central Provinces of O'Higgins and Colchagua, but is of only
casual occurrence.
Black-headed Duck (. Heteronetta atricapilla) .--Found from Santiago
to Valdivia. A bird of reedy ponds. I have never seen one, but during
an ornithological excursion near Santiago I was shown a breeding
area in a large marsh. Its nesting habits are parasitic, eggs are laid in
various Coots' nests, and I saw one such nest. What happens when the
young one hatches I do not know, but I doubt if it would be reared
by the Coots. It probably fends for itself. The Black-headed Duck has
never been kept alive. It is superficially rather like a Stiff-tailed Duck
(Erismatura) but is not a handsome bird.
Bronze-winged Duck ( Anas specularis). --This is undoubtedly the
most desirable duck which yet remains to be imported. It is very
handsome and should be easy to keep. It is abundant from the Straits
of Magellan to Valdivia and has occasionally been found as far north
as Valparaiso. It appears to be primarily a bird of wooded streams and

lakes. I saw quite a number on the Peulla River in November and it
was fairly common in the Aysen in January. I saw a number of family
parties in the latter area but the young were all full grown. I was unable
to obtain any live examples. I saw none at Maullin where, years ago,
Lord William Percy found it common. I would advise anyone who
attempts to obtain this Duck in the future to go to the Valdivia region
in early spring (September) and advertise in the local papers for eggs
and young ones. It is a well settled area and there would be no difficulty
about obtaining broodies. They would be easy birds to rear. I am
sure it is a typical duck and has nothing to do with the Crested Ducks
with which it is generally associated. The species has been kept in
the Santiago Zoo.
Crested Duck [Anas cristata cristata). --Ranges from Santiago to the
Straits of Magellan. A solitary duck inhabiting lakes in open country,
though in Tierra del Fuego it is said to live along the coast. They are
generally found in pairs and their habits are more like those of Sheld-
duck. I think that their closest relative is the Muscovy Duck. They are
bad tempered, but hardy and easy to keep. I only saw them in Aysen
where, in January, they had small ducklings and I found one nest.
A few specimens of this form have been imported and it has been kept
in the Santiago Zoo. It is a smaller and much greyer bird than the

abundantly from South Chile south to Tierra del Fuego, and
occasionally ranges as far north as Coquimbo. I saw many at Maullin
and Peulla and they were abundant in the Aysen where they were
breeding in January and had small ducklings.
Chilean Teal [JVettion flavirostre Jlavirostre) .--Common in South Chile
and ranges south to Tierra del Fuego. I saw them at Maullin and Peulla
and they were abundant in the Aysen.
Sharp-winged Teal (. JVettion flavirostre oxypterum) .--Recorded from
the Puna zone of Northern Chile from Tacna to Antofagasta. It is a
larger and paler bird than the typical race. I brought a large number
back from Peru in 1938, but they have not, unfortunately, become
established.
Bahama Pintail [Poecilonitta bahamensis rubrirostris ).--Occurs
irregularly in central Chile from Santiago to Curico.

Teal ( Querquedula versicolor fretensis). --Versicolor Teal are found
from Santiago south to Tierra del Fuego. Central Chilean birds
belong to the typical race, but those from the Aysen, Patagonia,
and the Falklands belong to a distinct sub-species, separable
on account of its larger size and heavier barring on belly, upper
and under tail-coverts, and flanks. Birds so far imported into
this country appear to be referable to the typical race. Terry Jones
was able to point out the differences of coloration immediately I
showed him an Aysen skin and this was later confirmed by an examina-
tion of the series in the British Museum. I only saw Versicolor Teal in
the Aysen, where it was not uncommon, and there were ducklings at
the beginning of January.
Puna Teal ( Querquedula versicolor puna). --Found in the Puna zone of
Northern Chile from Tacna to Antofagasta. I brought back a fair
number from Peru in 1938, and it has now been well established at
Leckford. I am personally in disagreement with systematists who
consider the Puna Teal to be a sub-species of the Versicolor. It is very
distinct, much larger, and with no yellow spot on the bill, which is
itself proportionately very much larger.
Cinnamon Teal ( Querquedula cyanoptera cyanoptera) .--An abundant
bird in Chile, found from Coquimbo to Tierra del Fuego. I saw a few
at Maullin and Peulla.
Andean Cinnamon Teal ( Querquedula cyanoptera orinomus). --Found in
a limited area of the Puna zone of Northern Chile (Antofagasta,
Tarapaca, and Tacna) and Southern Peru (Puno), and probably
extends into Bolivia. This is an altitudinal representative of the Com-
mon Cinnamon Teal, being somewhat larger than the typical race and
the ducks darker in coloration. The differences, however, are so
slight that the race is of no particular avicultural interest.
South American Shoveller ( Spatula platalea). --Recorded from
Santiago to the Straits of Magellan ; accidental in Tarapaca. Said
to be fairly common in Central Chile but rarer in the south. I never
came across it.
Rosy-billed Duck ( Metopiana peposaca). --Occurs from Santiago to
Valdivia. It is reported to be a fairly common resident of the Central
Provinces but it was not observed by me.
American Pochard ( JVyroca erythrophthalma) .--One record from
Northern Chile. The range of this bird extends to Western Peru,
Brazil, Venezuela, and various localities in Africa. There were
specimens in several European collections before the war.
Flightless Steamer-duck ( Tachyeres brachypterus) .--Ranges from
Chiloe Island to Tierra del Fuego, occasionally wandering northward
as far as Valdivia. This big, ponderous bird is common amongst the
islands of Southern Chile, and is a pure sea duck. No one could call
it a very ornamental bird ; a big, grey beast, with a yellow bill. I had

a few young ones and one adult brought to me in Melinka. At first
they fed voraciously on boiled wheat and I also used to try them with
some chopped-up fish and shellfish. Although they did well at first
they went into a decline on the voyage, refused almost all food and
only one arrived in good condition. I think they probably need a good
deal of animal food. They are savage birds and would be dangerous
with other ducks.
Flying Steamer Duck ( Tachyeres patachonicus) .--Same range as for
the preceding species, but breeds on the lakes of Southern Chile. I saw
flying birds on Lake Todos los Santos, on the Peulla River, and on a
small lake near Peulla called the Laguna de Encanto, and they must
have been breeding there, though I saw no young in December. A
friend saw examples at the same time on Lago Ranco, further to the
north. This resembles the flightless species, but is considerably
smaller.
Peruvian Ruddy Duck ( Erismatura ferruginea). Small-billed Ruddy
Duck {Erismatura vittata). --These two birds are very similar and are
difficult to tell apart. The former ranges from the Puna zone of
Northern Chile south to Tierra del Fuego, and the latter has been
recorded from Valparaiso to Tierra del Fuego. The existence side
by side of two such similar species is rather puzzling and our knowledge
of their distribution is still very sketchy. The only birds I saw, on small
ponds in Aysen, were referable to the Peruvian bird, of which I brought
back a few examples in 1938. I did not find them particularly difficult
to keep and they will eat grain like other ducks.
Torrent Duck (Merganetta armata armata). --Recorded from
Coquimbo south as far as Tierra del Fuego. It is a bird of fast-flowing
mountain streams and is at home in the wildest rapids. They are very
slender birds and the only live example I ever had in Peru could pass
through 2 in. mesh wire netting. I was only able to keep it alive for a
few days. This bird has never been imported and it would almost
certainly prove to be a most difficult subject in captivity. It takes very
largely animal food and would never thrive on the usual pond or
stream. I saw them on the Rio Petrohue between Lakes Todos los
Santos and Llanquihue and also at Coihaique in Aysen.
Magellan Penguin {Spheniscus magellanicus) .--Anyone making a
collecting trip to southern South America may feel tempted to bring
back some Penguins. Let me give anyone so misguided a solemn
warning. There is nothing more wearing for the temper on such a
trip than a Penguin. They are immensely strong and tough, very
savage, and have to be forcibly fed. When first caught it is quite
impossible to do anything with them for a few days. They then have
to be grabbed and crammed with fish daily until they arrive in England
and can be palmed off on someone else. So long as enough food is
pushed down their gullets every day they seem to thrive but it is a

painful process for the collector. The Penguin is armed with a very
sharp, hooked bill, and a bite is no joke. They can also hit surprisingly
hard with their flippers and feeding them is always a very blasphemous
process. The essentials for Penguins are the temper of an angel and a
supply of fish about the size of small herrings which can be pushed
down whole. I could not obtain any small fish and cramming Penguins
with strips off a large fish is far from funny. All mine were wild caught
adults. Hand-reared birds may be easier.

Three species of Swans nested at Leckford this year, Whooper,
Black-necked, and Black, and the difference in behaviour was very
marked ; in fact only two, the Black and Black-necked, had any
common actions.
The Black are always the first to begin, they generally start some-
where about the New Year. First of all a site is chosen for the nest
and a scrape is made by either the male or female or both. Building
begins by the bird in the scrape reaching as far as its neck will stretch
and pulling up bits of herbage which it drops first on one side of its
body and then on the other. The next stage is for one of the birds to
walk in a circle with the nest in part of the circuit. As it goes along
it reaches out with its neck for a mouthful of material and having
obtained one hands it backwards over its body as far as it can reach,
so that there is an accumulation of stuff travelling towards the nest
in the opposite direction to the bird. It is curious that when the bird
is approaching the nest the stuff is still handed backwards when it
could easily be taken by its mate or handed on to the nest by the
forager. Sometimes both birds forage at the same time, the one
walking a bit behind the other. The nests built by the pair here are
always extremely neat steep-sided affairs.
From the time the first egg is laid the nest is never left and the eggs
are always covered by a sitting bird. But for some mysterious reason
incubation does not start till the clutch is complete, and if felt the
eggs appear to be merely lukewarm. Both sexes sit, the male generally
relieving his mate at about eight a.m. and being relieved at about
five p.m. The change-over is interesting to watch. The relieving
bird climbs up the nest astern of its mate. When up it keeps dipping

its head below the other's tail and then raising its head over its mate's
back, uttering a very clear liquid note which sounds like " tu-leep "
repeated several times.
This note is used by either sex as they return to relieve the other
and never on any other occasion. After a minute or two the sitting
bird stands up and even before it has moved the other starts to slide
under its tail and on to the eggs, and its mate goes off. They shove
themselves on with a sliding motion, pulling their feet up under
themselves once they are in position, and after a little shuffling settle
down. Sometimes an egg is moved into a better position with the
aid of the bill and throat. As the relieved bird leaves the nest it
usually hands back two or three beakfuls of material towards the nest,
and while off duty will spend some time in collecting material.
Building never stops throughout incubation. The sitting bird is
constantly reaching down the side of the nest to pull up stuff which
has arrived there or any bits which are sticking out from the general
structure. The young on leaving the nest are greyish white. They
spend most of their time on the water, but do scramble up on to their
parents' backs, mostly the female's, for a rest now and again and only
for the first few days.
I have never seen pairing take place. The old birds make no
attempt to hide their young when humans approach, and are not
more than watchful unless the person obviously intends to handle
their young.
In the case of the Black-necked Swans the nest is a much smaller
and more slovenly affair. It is usually composed of much larger
material, rushes, and reeds. The female generally thinks about a nest
the day before she lays. Having selected a site she sits down and
without making a scrape first she reaches what she can, laying it on
either side of herself, and in the course of time shuffles round and
round till a little area is cleared as far as she can reach right round
the nest. The male then helps her by handing stuff back to her.
Being an extremely bad pedestrian he does not wander around as
does the Black, but reaches everything he can from where he stands
or more generally sits. The whole business of nest building is much
more haphazard.
The pair while laying do not remain at the nest, and when away
leave the eggs exposed or with an odd straw thrown nonchalantly
over them.
The female alone incubates, but the male sits constantly beside
the nest or else on the slope of the nest itself. He only rarely leaves her
for food and water. She leaves the nest very irregularly, not more
than once in two or three days and then generally in the evening.
He accompanies her.
Getting the young to the water is a major operation. It took the

pair all morning to travel about fifteen yards. At first the young live
almost entirely on their parents' backs, only coming off to feed a
little and then they scramble back, getting up by clambering between
their parents' wing feathers and body. Both male and female carry
the young. The young continue to ride occasionally when quite large,
and a couple of them on together nearly bring the water awash their
mother's wings. When little they snuggle up forward under the
scapulars, when big they generally ride across the old bird's wings.
The Black-necked Swans have one curious habit in common with
many species of ducks. The females in particular have a habit of
running their beaks over the quills of their flights, producing a sort
of tearing sound. It is part of the display of the female of such diverse
species as Chiloe and American Wigeon, Canvas-back and Carolina.
In the Carolina it forms one part of the male's display, and in the
Mandarin male has become more of a quick peck.
In the Whooper Swan the nest was built entirely by the male. Unlike
the other two species he chose a site in about a foot of water. He
built an enormous structure, easily 5 feet in diameter at the base.
Rushes, reeds, sedges, grass, and the roots of all three were piled up
till the nest was surrounded by a clear area of shallow water. This
effort started fully five weeks before the first egg was laid. The female
showed no interest whatsoever in the nest, and was never seen near it.
In the early days I thought this was to be a cock's nest on a grand
scale, but as time went by the female started to become heavier and
heavier, and yet she never went near the nest.
The nest had become about a cartload of stuff and merely a huge
flat-topped mound. The day before she laid I saw the female on the
nest for the first time. She was digging out a deep cup. In the afternoon
she was swimming quickly about the pool round the nest gathering
mouthfuls and feverishly handing them over her shoulder. The male,
who had spent most of his time standing on his nest when not building,
was now nowhere near.
The nest was always left when the female was not on laying, and the
eggs were covered with a good foot thickness of nest material. I suppose
because of the night frosts there must be during the Icelandic spring.
Incubation was carried out entirely by the female. The male did not
remain at her side but swam about at a considerable distance unless
there was any sign of danger to the future family, when he arrived
at top speed.
The Black and Black-necked sit on top of their nests, but the Whooper
was right down in hers, her back being about flush with the rim.
The female Whooper left her nest fairly regularly, almost daily
towards the end for about half an hour. She was generally off during
the warmest part of the afternoon, but the eggs were always well
covered.

The young after hatching were, as far as I know, never brooded
during the day, but were taken to the nest for their first few nights.
The cygnets never rode on their parents' backs. If anyone came near
the parents were very excited, though normally the tamest of our
Swans. The female hid her chicks behind some boards, and when
they got too big to squeeze in they were always hastily shoved under
some overhanging rushes. The young are pale grey with flesh-coloured
legs and beaks, the nails and nostril holes alone being dark. They
grow incredibly quickly compared to the other two species, and now
when full grown have pale grey white beaks, with nostrils and nails
black. Incubation in all cases is about forty days.

DUCK IN INDIA

By H. A. Fooks
I think that the keeping of geese, duck, and waders can afford
more pleasure than any other birds. The setting in which they are
kept lends itself more to the toute ensemble. The birds themselves also
become more confiding than other captives and even where closely
penned do not ceaselessly wander up and down the netting seeking
a way out.
I started in India twenty-five years ago with Garganey and Common
Teal. These, I am sorry to say, were kept with the ultimate view of
providing appetising dinners during the hot weather and monsoon.
They were kept in an enclosure made of brick walls 2 feet high
and covered with a bamboo and palm leaf roof. In the centre they
had a shallow cement pond surrounded with sand. Their diet con-
sisted of millet, powdered gram, and the green scum from surrounding
ponds. Food was given three times a day and a half hour was allowed
on each occasion. During this time one half of the roof was removed
and a wire netting top substituted. The remaining time the birds
were in semi-darkness which prevented them moving about too freely.
The result of this method was to produce birds in wonderful feather
and covered with fat. About fifty to sixty birds were placed in one
enclosure.
Since then I have used this method, of keeping freshly caught
duck, with great success. They all became very steady and answered
the feeding whistle promptly after they were released.

In Calcutta all animals and birds were brought alive into the
markets and if regular visits were made such comparative rarities as
Falcated Teal and Marbled Duck might be picked up for a few
shillings.
The commonest duck in Bengal is probably the Gadwall, followed
by the Shoveller, Pintail, Wigeon, Garganey, and Common Teals.
Ruddy Shelduck are indigenous as well as the Comb Duck, Greater
and Lesser Whistling Teal and the Cotton Teal. Red Crested Pochard
were common and could usually be bought for about 8 d. each. If
bought on the day of their arrival the birds were still in good condition
and soon settled down after water and food had been given them.
If immediately released in water they became waterlogged, as their
plumage had lost most of its oil content.
During my time as Honorary Secretary of the Zoo I continually
tried to establish duck in the Gardens in a free state and after several
attempts managed to induce over 800 Lesser Whistling Teal to use
the Gardens as a sanctuary during the winter months.
I started by releasing pinioned pairs in the hopes that they would
breed. One pair did so in the Rhino enclosure and lost their brood
by the tidal waves created by the Rhinos taking their morning baths.
The second year precautions were taken and nine successfully reared
to maturity. Six of these were left full winged and after leaving us
for several months returned with several friends until, some years later,
there was literally a cloud.
Egyptian Geese at once repaid their liberation by breeding and
although some were shot outside the Gardens I only hope that they
are still allowed their liberty.
I have often wondered why the Comb Duck has never been
domesticated as they are far better looking birds than the Muscovy.
The drake, with his golden side tufts, is really handsome and every
bit as large as a Muscovy.
Every year I awaited the advent of Christmas with impatience.
Not because of the celebrations but because of my leave which was
spent on the Chilka Lakes in the Province of Orissa.
Here was the winter home of countless thousands of migrating
duck, geese, and waders besides Flamingos and Demoiselle Cranes.
Photographing, sketching, trapping, and shooting for the pot was my
personal idea of an ideal holiday.
My two Indian gun boys commenced working with me when they
were fifteen and sixteen years old. They were far better than spaniels
in retrieving shot duck and absolute experts at catching them alive.
For Barheaded and Greylag Geese we put up as many as 500 snares,
in the centre of which sat one of my old tame decoy geese. One old
Bar head seemed to enjoy enticing his brethren to their fate which he
did with great expertness year after year.

Flamingos were difficult to catch as they rarely fed twice on the
identical sandbar. The snarer also had to be within a short distance
as, once caught, the Flamingo has a frightful habit of snapping his
legs if allowed to struggle. These birds travelled best " folded up "
and they always arrived in good fettle in Calcutta.
The number and variety of waders at Chilka is astonishing and
although I never succeeded in trapping a rarity I did shoot a Snipe-
billed Godwit (Macrorhamphus semipalmatus ) out of a flock of Black-
tailed and feel quite certain saw some Spoon-billed Stint (Eurynorhynchus
pygmeus).
One of the great standbys in feeding freshly caught duck and
waders was dried shrimps, finely powdered and mixed into a paste
with grain or rice flour. When fed with a mixture of brown bread
to our Flamingos in the Zoo their plumage changed from an insipid
pink to the real thing, and I remember Mr. C. Webb remarking on
their brilliant plumage.
The two Pink-headed Duck in the Gardens disappeared at about
the same time that a distinguished German Zoo proprietor was on a
visit to Calcutta. Americans were paying as much as Rs. 750 per
pair for these birds. There are still quite a number about in the
Purneah district though their numbers must be rapidly dwindling
owing to continual trapping by the locals. Hundreds must have been
eaten by those who knew no better. The Indian name " Golab Seer "
applies also to the Red-crested Pochard.
There is another well known place where the White-winged
Wood Duck is found in fair quantities. This place was unfortunately
discovered by a dealer and the numbers have since been sadly
reduced.
Of the Indian indigenous duck I would consider the Cotton Teal
hardest of all to keep. I found it essential to feed pond scum every
day. This scum contains daphniae in large quantities and as the
Cotton Teal appears to be highly insectivorous, the feeding of grain,
even in milk, was found of no use.
All duck seem to stand extremes of temperature very well. Certainly
the heat which with us rose to as much as 116* in the shade with a
humidity of 70* and 8o*.
The Gardens had an old Snow Goose gander who had been there
at least ten or more years. His plumage was always immaculate and
he had paired with a Greylag Goose, though no eggs were laid.
As far as I remember no migratory duck ever laid eggs in the
Gardens, though this was not the case with Australian or New Zealand
birds. When ever enclosed birds did lay it was essential to remove
any Ruddy Sheldduck from the enclosure. These duck, one and all,
seem to be bad tempered in spite of the very charming folk tale the
Indians tell about them.

By D. H. S. Risdon
Ornamental Ducks are not usually considered as possible aviary
inmates, but in point of fact the smaller species look beautiful and
thrive in aviaries provided that such are large enough to enclose
a pond.
By pond I mean something not less than 15 or 20 feet across, which
presupposes an aviary of at least twice this length and width to ensure
sufficient land space as well. Some books tell us that waterfowl will
do well with a minimum of water, and I myself have seen a pair of
Mandarins whose pond consisted of an old bath sunk in the ground.
This pair, I was told, bred regularly every year and the ducklings
were successfully reared.
Be that as it may, the beauty of waterfowl to my mind is only seen
at its best when the birds are disporting themselves on the water.
They cannot show themselves to advantage in a puddle, and unless
I could give them decent swimming space I would not keep them.
A pond of the above dimensions is not beyond the scope of anyone
with a reasonably sized garden, and the hours of pleasure to be derived
from watching several pairs of brightly coloured Ducks gliding about
on such a piece of water will amply repay the trouble and cost of
making it.
Naturally only the smaller species of waterfowl make suitable
aviary birds. Geese and the larger kinds of Duck require too much
land space on which to graze to be enclosed in even a large aviary.
One great advantage in keeping Ducks in an aviary is that you don't
have to have them pinioned--an operation which always disfigures
them to a certain extent by making them look lopsided, especially
when flapping their wings.
In an aviary unpinioned such species as Mandarins and Garolinas
make full use of their wings and seem able to control their flight as
well as a Pigeon in an enclosed space. Being arboreal they perch
readily, and if the perches are thick enough (not less than the thick-
ness of a broom handle) they will spend quite a bit of time on them
or flying to and from them to the pond.
One can thus get the pleasure of watching Ducks rising from and
alighting on the water, all of which is missed with pinioned birds.
Then again when they are playing " ducks and drakes " it is a lovely
sight to watch them dive, come to the top, and spreading their wings,
skim the surface in pursuit of one another before diving again.
I found a practical difficulty in obtaining unpinioned birds. Most
waterfowl breeders, the majority of whose customers require birds
for open lakes and ponds, naturally enough pinion their ducklings

as soon as they are hatched. Consequently I found it quite a job to
get full winged birds unless I ordered them in advance of the breeding
season. When full-winged waterfowl are first introduced into an
aviary care must be taken not to give them sudden frights, as they
are liable to shoot straight into the wire in panic and break their
necks. For this reason, if the birds are at all timid, it is best to clip one
wing before releasing them. By the time they have moulted the
clipped flights they will have settled down and should know the
limits of their enclosure.
The smaller kinds of Duck are perfectly harmless towards other
birds. Mine used to share the aviary with all kinds of Finches and
softbills as well as Golden and Amherst Pheasants and completely
ignored them.
Incidentally a fallacy I would like to explode is the idea that
Ducks will destroy fish. True they may eat spawn or small fry if
they can catch them and, should a fish die, they will tear its body
to pieces ; but practically all the commonly kept kinds of Duck are
not adapted for fish catching. They are neither quick enough nor are
their beaks constructed for seizing and holding a slippery thing like
a live fish.
Owners of ponds containing goldfish who contemplate adding a
pair or two of fancy waterfowl need have no fears therefore for the
goldfish. My duck pond contained a large shoal of fish of all sizes,
including carp, rudd, bream, perch, goldfish, and golden orfe, and
except when a fish died I never knew my Ducks to attempt to
eat one.
An ornamental duck pond is a great asset to a large planted aviary.
Many of the other inmates appreciate the close proximity to water ;
for instance. Weavers, and, if there are suitable shallows round the
edge, all will use it for drinking and bathing. Incidentally I never lost
a bird through drowning except one with a clipped wing, and that
strangely enough was a Lapwing. A clipped winged bird loses some
of its natural balance and if it falls into a pond seems unable to struggle
to safety as it will if full winged.
I noticed the same thing in a friend's enclosure just before the war.
The area was too large to be completely netted over so he had the land
surrounding his duck pond enclosed with a high wire fence to enable
him to keep some Pheasants and other ground birds in it with clipped
wings. He lost a Reeves's, a Silver Pheasant and a Purple Gallinule
through drowning, and yet in my aviary containing a duck pond
I bred Golden and Amherst Pheasants full-winged year after year
with never a casualty. Even the tiny chicks would run to the water's
edge for a drink. Sometimes one would topple in, but it always
scrambled back to safety.
It is a great advantage if one can have water laid on to the pond.

It is then a simple matter to keep clean. My pond used to have a
continuous trickle of fresh water into it and I never had to clean it
out from one year's end to the other, the water always remaining
sweet though by no means clear, due to the activities of the Ducks
themselves, who were for ever stirring up the bottom in their search
for tit-bits.
If you cannot have water laid on an occasional flushing through
with the garden hose will keep it clean. This is especially necessary
in hot dry weather, when the water level sinks through evaporation
and there is no rain to freshen it up.
It is a mistake to feed Ducks on their pond where this is of the size
under discussion. What one can do in a large natural lake is another
thing to what can be done in the confines of a cement pond in an
aviary. Uneaten food helps to foul the water. For this reason I always
fed my Ducks in bowls some distance away from the pond.
This is another advantage of keeping Ducks in an aviary. You can
leave food always before them and there will be no fear of it being
stolen by Sparrows or rats. This is a boon to anyone who is away
from home all day and except in the long days of summer cannot get
home in time to give his Ducks their evening meal.
Whilst it is not possible to grow water lilies or other ornamental
plants in a Duck pond I made mine look very natural and presentable
by growing coarse rushes round the edge which used to hang over the
concrete rim and effectively disguise it.
Whilst on the subject of plants Ducks adore pond weeds of all kinds
as well as the better known duckweed. I used to make expeditions
to wayside ponds and bring them back a bucketful or two of pond
weed, duckweed and all the water insects that came with it. This
was thrown on the water, and while it lasted my Ducks hardly ate
their normal food at all.
Before closing I will mention the species which I kept successfully
as aviary birds.
Mandarins and Carolinas are easily top favourites. Besides being
the most beautiful of all the small Ducks they are particularly suited
to aviary life as they perch a lot and can manoeuvre on the wing in
a confined space. Being nest box users they breed freely under such
conditions, and the security of the aviary makes the ducklings parti-
cularly safe from vermin. I found, however, that two such nearly
related species quarrelled badly in the spring although they were
amiable enough out of the breeding season.
White-faced Tree Ducks were quaint and amusing. Here again
they perch quite a bit. They seem naturally tame and soon learn to
come running towards you when you enter the aviary. I never bred
them, but then they are not considered easy breeders under any
conditions.

Tufted are well worth a place in any collection. Ungainly on
land they are as buoyant as corks on the water, and their diving
antics are a perpetual source of delight.
Common Wigeon did very well, but were not particularly interesting
in an aviary. They really want more grazing ground than they can
get under such conditions.
Moorhens are excellent aviary birds, especially where the pond is
small. They must, however, be hand-reared. Wild caught ones are
hopeless as they do not overcome their wildness and never show
themselves. Unlike Ducks they cannot be trusted with small birds,
and I certainly would not risk ducklings or Pheasant chicks in their
aviary.

Soon after my return from Europe, I went on my annual tour of
inspection of the Trumpeter Swans' refuges. The census for 1947,
effected mostly by aeroplane, shows a slight decrease (4) in the wild
birds population. In Montana, outside the Government refuges, the lakes
where the birds used to stay and breed are getting more and more
surrounded by summer cabins and vacation camps, the result being
that, this year, only 10 adults and no cygnets were counted there,
against 14 adults and 15 cygnets in 1946.
Inside the Red Rock Refuge, the only real stronghold of the species
in the United States, there was an increase of 7 : 169 adults and 52
cygnets, against 167 adults and 47 cygnets last year. There were 24
adults in Idaho, against 23 ; 60 adults, 8 cygnets, in the Yellowstone,
against 51 adults, 10 cygnets last year. At the Elk Refuge, Jackson,
Wyoming, where Trumpeter Swans have been introduced a number of
years ago, 6 adults were counted, but none bred this year. Altogether,
there are to-day 323 wild Trumpeter Swans in the United States.
Two conclusions are obvious. First, in the wild state under the
present circumstances the annual crop of cygnets is practically
wasted. The Red Rock Lakes Refuge is already over-stocked and the
surplus population leaves it, only to die of starvation or lack of water,
or to be illegally shot outside. We did not capture any cygnets in 1946
nor in 1947 in order to find out whether or not the previous captures
had affected the level of the wild stock. The answer has been that

it did not in the least. It seems, therefore, preferable to capture more
young birds every year. Second, it is hopeless to expect this large
sedentary species to thrive in unprotected parts of the country now
settled by man. Enforcement of the law is wellnigh impossible in these
remote thinly inhabited highlands. Our programme of propagation
of the species under control appears to be sound. The captive birds
at Malheur Lake (Oregon) are doing well and the 1944 pairs should
start breeding next spring in separate pens. I have just transferred
12 1945 birds to the Ruby Lake Refuge, Nevada, a huge marsh of
many thousands of acres at an elevation of 6,000 feet, where we hope
to establish later on the young Swans which may be reared by these
captive pairs.
The breeding season of wild Ducks has been poor again this year in
North America. Therefore the hunting period has been limited by
the Government to thirty days in the East, and thirty-five days in the
West, with a daily bag of four birds only, a very sound, if hardly
sufficient measure.
I recently visited the Tracy aviaries at Salt Lake City. Under the
excellent care of Mr. Colvin Wilson and his assistant, a very good
collection of birds is maintained, the Parrots and Waterfowl being
particularly interesting. Many exotic species are represented among
the latter, but the local ones are the more remarkable. There are
great numbers of birds on the ponds, the majority of which are
specimens that have been gathered on the nearby Utah State Refuge,
where they were found ill with botulism, an infection which kills
thousands of birds every year. By careful treatment in fresh clean
water 70 per cent of the birds are saved, which otherwise would have
undoubtedly perished. Other Ducks are reared from eggs gathered
around the ponds. Mr. Wilson is particularly successful with the
charming little Ruddy Ducks ; he has dozens of them and they lay
freely. Eggs are hatched in an incubator and reared in a brooder.
They are given access to open water immediately and are fed very
simply on Spratt's duck meal, and lettuce. Mr. Wilson tells me
that the secret of his success consists in putting a yearling female with
the ducklings. Once he was short of Ruddy females and he successfully
substituted a female Lesser Scaup, and it worked perfectly well.
Ruddy ducklings are born very large and need more company than

brooding ; only if the weather is chilly and wet does he suffer losses.
The Salt Lake City valley is particularly favourable to the breeding
of Waterfowl. At an altitude of 4,000 feet the climate is always
moderately cold or warm and none of the worse kinds of vermin :
Raccoon, Opossum, Bob-cat, Snapping-turtle, occurs there, a
rare privilege in North America.
Mr. Wilson rears by hand every year such difficult birds as Avocets,
Stilts, Willets, various Gulls and Plovers, and this gives an idea of his

Apart from the sportsmen of the Lower Scheldt and the coasts, some

by name, the beautiful duck which is the subject of this article ;
and this in spite of the fact that it is a bird which belongs to the fauna
of our country which it visits regularly, though in varying numbers.
This is due no doubt to the fact that the visits of this inhabitant of
more northerly regions only occur during cold and bad weather,
and these meteorological factors rightly induce many of our com-

sanctuary on the waters and rivers of our coasts, hasten to return
to nest in their true habitat in the Scandinavian and Baltic countries,
Russia and the tundras of Siberia.
The Goldeneye or " Garrot sonneur " (Ringing Duck--so called
because of the sharp clacking noise of the wings when in rapid flight),
owes its names of " Brilleend " or " Brilduiker " (Spectacled Duck)
in Dutch and " Quattr'occhi 55 (Four-eyes) in Italian, to the presence
of a round white spot in front of the eye ; the Germans call it
" Schellente ", while the golden-yellow colour of the iris has earned
for it its English name of " Golden-eye ". Certain systematic orni-
thologists still maintain that it should be called " Morillon sonneur "
while the most competent scientists have definitely shown that there
are only superficial resemblances to the diving ducks of the genus
Aythya (Fuligila) and that the true nearest relations are the
Mergansers ( Mergus) with which they readily associate and some-
times cross in the wild state.
Few water birds have ever interested me to such an enormous extent
as the Goldeneyes, whether they be the indigenous species or their

218 jean marie dersgheid--the goldeneye in captivity
relatives from Iceland and North America. These curious little
ducks have such outstanding personality, characteristic appearance
and behaviour, and a temperament marked by a queer mixture of
boldness and wild mistrust that it seems to me difficult not to become
attached to them and to wish to possess some specimens in one's
collection of waterfowl.
Except during the moult or eclipse (which lasts from July to
October), the male Goldeneye is clad in an extremely becoming and
distinctive dress. The head which is set off by the golden coloured
eye and the white spot at the base of the beak is a beautiful black with
bottle-green metallic reflections, the feathers at the back of the head,
and of the nape of the neck are elongated and taper off in such a way
as to form a large crest, or rather a sort of brilliant helmet. The back
and the feathers of the wings and tail are of a more dull black. All
the rest of the body is of an immaculate snow-white ; the scapulars
and some of the wing coverts are white, and tapered in long lancets
which fall back on each side of the rest of the wing. The feet are
yellow, but the interdigital webs are black.
The female, which is of lighter build and smaller than her mate,
is of a general grey colour, the upper parts being white ; the head
has a brownish tinge becoming more marked in spring, when a
narrow collar of pure white appears and a spot of orange at the end
of the greyish black beak. The male in eclipse is indistinguishable
from the female, except by the purer colour of the iris and the almost
uniform black colour of the beak ; it is almost impossible to dis-
tinguish the young males from their sisters before the second year,
except by their behaviour when they begin to think of courting.
Although there is a good deal of shooting in Lower Belgium,
especially in December and January, it is extremely difficult to
procure living specimens of Goldeneyes ; those which are lightly
hit by a shot in the wing die quickly, and for fifteen years it has been
strictly forbidden to catch diving ducks in nets as is done on a large
scale in Denmark, Prussia, and Holland. In addition, it is very
unusual for Goldeneyes to be caught in duck decoys. It should be
noted that almost all the specimens taken in our country are females
or young males, and it is comparatively rare to get an adult male in
breeding plumage. It appears that the latter usually do not come
sufficiently far south for their wintering quarters.
But the greatest obstacle with which those who wish to keep Golden-
eyes have to contend is not their rarity in the market, but, strange
though this may seem, the almost insurmountable difficulties of
accustoming them to a life in captivity. I do not know of any other
European species which is more difficult to accustom to these new
conditions and particularly to stop them from letting themselves to
die of starvation ; and I have not hesitated to state in another article

that a single Goldeneye can give you more trouble in the month
following its capture than a whole cargo of Golibris or the most
delicate Birds of Paradise.
For those who are not disheartened by difficulties and troubles
I describe below the only method which has, up to the present,
given me passably satisfactory results in so far as that thanks to it
I have succeeded in keeping alive more than half of the Goldeneyes
captured in the wild state which have been sent to me.
It is necessary to endeavour only to accept Goldeneyes in good
condition, that is to say not wounded (or only very lightly on the
wing), not affected by waste oil, and not worn out by fatigue and lack
of food ; also to insist that they are sent by the quickest means possible
after they are caught. After they have been inspected on arrival, put
them alone in an enclosure (a room or shed), without much light,
and if there is any wire netting this should not extend to the floor,
but end in a solid partition ; this is in order to prevent them from
wearing out their strength by continually walking backwards and
forwards in the hope of escape. In addition, it is advisable to ensure
that the new captives are kept absolutely quiet and not disturbed,
except for their meals. These should be given three, or if possible
four, times a day at regular intervals. During the first days it should
consist of an entirely animal diet, because in the wild state these birds
consume a large amount of marine and fresh-water molluscs, worms,
and other aquatic animal matter, and they only take water plants
and seeds if forced to for lack of anything else. During the first two
or three weeks of their life here the wild Goldeneyes are generally
given a mixture of raw meat (cut in pieces the size of a dice), pieces
of fish (whiting, small freshwater fish, etc.) also raw, and mussels
freshly taken out of their shells ; the freshwater snails (Limnaea,
Planorbis, etc.) are also excellent food as long as they can be pro-
cured in sufficient quantities. After eight or fifteen days we add to
this mixture a quarter part of pieces of bread or soaked Spratts biscuits,
and this proportion is gradually increased till the birds can be con-
sidered as completely acclimatized.
In point of fact during the first days wild Goldeneyes all refuse to
touch any food that is given to them, whatever it may be ; it has
proved essential to feed them by force by hand, by opening the beak
and pushing a piece of meat, fish, biscuit, or a mussel down their
throats with one's finger, after having well soaked the food in water.
At each of the three or four meals we thus made our birds swallow
six or eight pieces, and we left them an equal number soaking in
water in a little bowl at their door. Care should be taken that this
is the only water available to the Goldeneyes in order eventually to
persuade them to take their food themselves at the same time as
their drink. There are people who have the moral force to go on

hunger strike, but I doubt if there are many--men or animals--who
have the courage to embark on a thirst strike.
So far as Goldeneyes are concerned, the most reasonable birds
capitulate after about a week of forced feeding ; this can be proved
by counting the pieces of food which are left in the bowl. The most
obstinate, which are probably the oldest, refuse to take food for
themselves for three weeks or even a month ; but there are few which
do not respond to this treatment, and such birds can be noted by
their extreme emaciation.
When our pupils are eating regularly of their own free will, one
can think of putting them in their permanent quarters outside. They
will by this time have already lost a great deal of their first wildness
but, nevertheless, it is dangerous to release them suddenly in a large
enclosure or on an extensive piece of water which is strange to them,
where there is the risk that they may not find the food which has
been prepared for them.
In order to solve this difficulty, it is best to put them (beside their
enclosure) in a little pen, made of wire netting, covering a corner of
the water and near the spot where they will afterwards regularly
receive their food. This will prevent them from hiding themselves
away in some corner or under some remote brushwood on first being
liberated, where they run the risk of resuming their instinctive wild-
ness ; they can thus get to know their surroundings as well as their
future companions in captivity (or rather semi-liberty).
Except in the unusual circumstances when the aviculturist can
place his ducks in a large enclosed aviary with a sufficiently wide
stretch of water, it must be made impossible for the Goldeneyes to
fly away. The only practical solution is to pinion them by removing
the bone from the end of one wing, with its seven to nine primaries.
I will describe on another occasion exactly how this operation can
be performed with the minimum of suffering for the patient and risk
of infection to the inevitable little wound. The permanent in-
capacitating of a bird has always seemed to me barbarous and more
prejudicial to its good health, because of the stiffness of the joint
thus immobilized. The method of simply cutting the primaries of
one of the wings with scissors is not at all practical, because it is
necessary to recapture the birds each spring before the new feathers
have grown, and heaven knows it is not easy to catch such adroit
divers as Goldeneyes on a pond or even a small pool.
One of the greatest pleasures derived from these birds by their
owners is from their prowess in swimming. One can watch them for
hours at a time diving almost ceaselessly as if they wished systematically
to explore the bottom of the pond. The dive is preceded by a little
upward and forward jump, very different from that of the other diving
ducks. Underwater (unlike the Eiders, Longtailed Duck, etc..

and also the Auks and Penguins) Goldeneyes never swim with their
wings open, but have them tightly folded across the back ; the feet
are stretched out, then pushed backwards and upwards, and in its
progress the bird often dives in a spiral which gives it an appearance
of a strange amphibian. The dives are not prolonged, and seldom
last longer than fifty seconds, but the distance covered may sometimes
be considerable ; on our ponds when in winter the surface is almost
entirely covered with ice, I have often seen Goldeneyes diving in a
hole cut in the ice and appearing at another hole sometimes twenty-
five to thirty metres away ; the same performance, it appears, is
the favourite occupation of the Smews ( Mergus albellus) which were
their companions in captivity.
Without being exactly unsociable, as much in the wild state as on
our ponds, they do not disport themselves with any other species of
waterfowl ; the surface feeding ducks, Teal, Pintail, Mallard, etc.,
they apparently avoid with disdain, usually remaining at a little
distance from these noisy flocks, preferring to dive at their leisure in
some quiet corner of the pond ; on the other hand they seem to enjoy,
especially in autumn and winter, the company of their near relatives
(such as Bucephala islandica and Charitonetta albeola, their companions
in our enclosure), and also the company of Mergansers ; of the three
species of Mergansers with which I placed our Goldeneyes, they
certainly preferred the Smews ( Mergus albellus ), with which they had
much in common in disposition and behaviour.
The last rigours of winter are not over before the male Goldeneyes
begin to display and show that the breeding season is approaching ;
contrary to the behaviour of most birds, where the females appear to
remain entirely unaffected by the show of attractions and prowess of
their suitors, it can be observed that the female Goldeneyes appreciate
the efforts made by the aspirants to catch their attention, and it even
often excites them and arouses them, which is sometimes shown by
significant chattering, sometimes by quick movements of the head
from right to left close to the surface of the water, and sometimes by
attitudes expressive of perfect coquetry or by demonstrations of
assumed or real jealousy.
As in the Mergansers, the attitudes in the display of the male
Goldeneyes are numerous, various, and sometimes comic ; they often
appear to be accompanied by apparently considerable vocal efforts,
but which result in practically nothing, at least so far as can be heard
by human ears ; this fact should be particularly noted as the trachea
of these birds has peculiar anatomical features apparently connected
with the emission of special sounds.
One of the most remarkable movements in the display consists of
a sudden forward movement of the body, the head being erect, the
throat dilated as if the bird is about to call, and the beak is elevated

vertically towards the sky ; at the same time the tail, which is extended
fanwise is lowered with a sharp movement, while the two feet with the
webs distended strike the water violently backwards, causing a
cascade of water behind the bird. I have depicted this phase of the
display in one of the subjects in the accompanying illustration, which
shows a little band of Goldeneyes, four males and two females,
reuniting in Spring on their breeding grounds in the north of Europe.
There only remains to say a few words about the rearing of Golden-
eyes in captivity. It was in 1924, at Mr. Blaauw's estate at Gooilust
(Holland) that I was able to see breeding pairs with their young for
the first time, a number of which subsequently came to my own
collection ; here they joined not only several specimens captured in
the wild state, but also two or three Goldeneyes which had been
bred by a German aviculturist, Dr. Goldner, of Dresden, who up to
the present is the only person, except Mr. Blaauw, who has succeeded
in breeding Bucephala clangula. I had great hopes of successfully
breeding this species in my turn in 1940, having succeeded after six
years of effort in establishing a small stock of healthy adult pairs, well
accustomed to their enclosures--but the events of 1939-40 caused
the death of these specimens and reduced these hopes--like many
others--to nothing.
Once the period of acclimatization is over, the feeding of Golden-
eyes is not particularly difficult, above all if the birds are put on a
natural piece of water, where reeds and other plants provide an
abundance of little molluscs and other animal matter. In normal
times the Goldeneyes are given twice a day a mash consisting of
three-quarters part barley meal and a quarter of good meat and fish
meal mixed together, and a little cod liver oil, kitchen salt, and a
quarter per cent of iodide of sodium or potassium is added to the
whole. Contrary to the true Sea ducks (Eiders, Long-tailed Ducks,
Scoters, etc.) which should not be allowed to eat grain (wheat,
maize, etc.), even for a short time, Goldeneyes seem able to accustom
themselves well to a diet in which there is a proportion of seed, which
makes it possible to keep them in the same enclosure as ducks which
are fed on grain, but, nevertheless, a diet which is rich in animal
albumen is essential to keep them in good health for any length of
time.
I will relate in a future article the observations which I have been
able to make during a number of years on the keeping and rearing
of a considerable number of specimens of a closely allied species,
which is even more attractive, Barrow's Goldeneye (Bucephala islandica ).

By J. G. Laidlay
The following notes on hand-rearing of Red-breasted Geese may
be of interest to some. I think it was in the year 1936 the Duke of
Bedford very kindly gave me six young Red-breasted. These proved
to be four males and two females ; two of the males died within the
next two years, of avian consumption, leaving two pairs. More
recently a further male died leaving two females and one male.
In 1946 one of them laid and hatched four young, which died. This
year the same Goose laid five eggs. Four of these were set under
a hen and the fifth left with the Goose, who unfortunately was killed
by a boy. The second and last remaining Goose sat on this egg and
hatched it, but it died a few days after hatching. The four eggs
under the hen hatched in due course--three one day and the fourth
a day later. Of these four only the first hatched showed a glossy and
slightly tinged rufous down in parts, the other three being a dull
sooty colour. Of the three dull-coloured goslings one died on the
fifth day after hatching and the other two on the sixth day. These
three goslings fed well, seemingly to prefer weeds and white clover
to young grass, but all the time looked and were discontented and
unsatisfied ; their droppings were liquid and black, unlike the
first, and I take it normally coloured gosling, whose droppings were
normal, and he or she seemed well content. Does lack of colour in
down state show lack of health ? No. 1 gosling, as I shall call him,
throve faster than any other gosling I have reared, and at three weeks
old, to my eye, resembled a Canadian gosling in down more than
any other species. On its 25th day it was trying to honk, and on the
28th day was showing flight feathers ; on the 30th day colour of
feathers on flanks and white edges clearly visible--and on its fifth
week the red of the breast could be seen under the down. At six weeks'
old it was completely feathered with down still attached to neck
and some on legs, and to-day, its seventh week from hatching, is
completely feathered and coloured, bar the cheeks which are dull
brown ; tail white tipped and a little white on black underparts,
otherwise it resembles an adult. If anything is learnt from the
rearing of this bird it is that given unrelated stock--the Woburn birds
are, as is well known, hopelessly inbred--they are the easiest of Geese
to rear, and, as would be expected from such a northern nesting species,
are very fast growing. Secondly, as I remarked earlier in this article,
it would seem that colour distinctly denotes health. One further fact
might be mentioned in that during the first five weeks the gosling
fed continuously, whereas now it feeds most heavily in the late evening
and early morning.

" From troubles of the world I turn to ducks." The majority of
Englishmen who take this as their text shoulder a twelve-bore or rig
up the punt-gun, and spend an exciting and enjoyable time shooting
some of the most interesting and beautiful of birds. Others, however,
amongst whom I like to think are most of those who will read this
article, find more pleasure in the contemplation of living waterfowl
than in the " supremely satisfying smack " with which a shot Mallard's
still living body strikes the ground.
My own experiences with ducks have been few, but sufficient to
endear them to me in extent that together with the Pigeons and the
Corvidae they rank as three families of birds which above all others
I find especially appealing. My first attempt at keeping waterfowl
was at the tender (?) age of 13 when I procured six Mallard's eggs
(we will not say how or whence !), which I carried home furtively and
precariously inside my shirt. They were set under a Rhode Island Red
and in due course hatched, but thanks to my ignorance and the foster
mother's clumsiness only one--a drake--was successfully reared. As
soon as he could fly he betook himself to a pond about a quarter
of a mile away, where for some weeks he defied all efforts at recapture,
and then returned of his own accord on what would no doubt have
been purely an ephemeral " bread and butter visit " had I not--
cruelly as I now realize--caught him up and clipped his wings. This
procedure--like history--repeated itself the following summer when
he regained his primaries, and would no doubt have done so in his
third summer had I not penned him up as soon as his new feathers
started to grow until they were grown enough to clip. That year,
however, five Mallard's eggs were obtained in July. Two were eaten
by a tame Magpie and two were trampled on by the mother hen.
(After this I learnt to use small light bantams for hatching Mallards'
eggs and never lost a duckling), but the survivor was a duck and so
at last the old drake had a wife to cheer his captivity. The duck did
not nest the following spring, and as the birds appeared inseparable
I expected, when the drake grew his wing-feathers and at once flew
off to the pond, that he would soon return. He did not, being evidently
in agreement with the man who said that women were very sweet,
but he did not believe in letting them interfere with the really important
things in life !
His mate acquired her new plumage and became airborne some
weeks afterwards. For a month or so she delighted me with her high
circling flights and rushing descents on curved wings that invariably
ended in an undignified " head-over-heels " landing on the lawn.

Then she discovered the pond and her absent love, and that was
that. I had not the heart to try to recapture them, and for several
months they lived there happily, being fed only two or three times
a week and finding most of their provender. Then one day when I went
to feed them the duck was missing and the drake trailed a shot-shattered
wing. Fearful for his safety I decided to recapture him, but it was
many weeks ere I was able to do so. I had some more Mallards then,
young birds who gave him scant welcome. He had no greater wish
for their company and wandered away across the flower-beds. Deeming
escape impossible in his flightless state I left him to his own devices.
Half an hour later he was gone. Yes ! he was back at the pond,
having evidently gone out of the front gate and done the journey on
foot. I thought it kindest to let him take his chance in the home of
his choice. He lived on for several months and then vanished, killed
no doubt, but how I know not.
Other Mallards kept proved equally interesting, although if left
full-winged they never stayed for long. (I had only a half an acre of
garden and a small concrete pond.) Many aviculturists can see no
beauty or interest in a bird unless its price puts it beyond the reach
of all but the most affluent, but for those not so constituted the humble
Mallard has much to recommend it, but judging from what I have
observed over many years in St. James's Park it is apt to be rather
aggressive to other waterfowl and more particularly to their young,
although not so bad in this respect as the Ruddy Sheldduck and
Red-crested Pochard.
Domestic Muscovy Ducks do not I suppose come properly within
the scope of our magazine, but I cannot forbear all mention of birds
which have in the past given me so much pleasure. Muscovies have
the one great advantage that even in a small waterless garden one may
keep them full-winged and have the joy of seeing them perch heraldic
on the chimney-pots and gable ends, or fly off to visit local ponds,
secure in the knowledge that, until the inevitable day when they meet
" the man with the gun 55 they will return, winging through the air
with strong goose-like wing beats to alight at one's feet and thrust
fumbling beaks into one's hands for food. In a wild state, of course, they
nest in hollow trees, and the tame ones are apt to be a nuisance to all
concerned in their search for such accommodation. It is most amusing
to see how at such times a fat old domestic Muscovy will bestir herself,
flying from roof to roof and from tree to tree, prying and peering.
Like the Jackdaw they often mistake a chimney for a rather deep
but otherwise suitable hole, and if they can squeeze down into it
do so, with disastrous results. I noticed that the Muscovies I saw in
Egypt--where they are the common tame ducks of every native
village--seemed to fly far less than those one sees in this country,
indeed I cannot remember ever having seen one fairly on the wing.

My first ornamental waterfowl properly so called were two Carolina
drakes. They were delightful little birds, very different from the over-
large " Aylesbury type 55 Carolinas which are, alas ! so popular, or at
least were pre-war. I had them for some eight months when Fate
in the form of a fox, at one fell swoop destroyed all my waterfowl with
the exception of one full-winged Muscovy. Hearing of my loss the
good people from whom the Carolinas had been purchased most
kindly made me a present of two Sheldducks, a female South African,
and a male Paradise Duck. I can only presume that the latter had
not actually been paired to the South African, since from the moment
they were let out he ignored her existence and attached himself to
the afore-mentioned Muscovy whom he escorted everywhere. Whether
some period of his early life had conditioned him to react thus towards
Muscovies or whether her snow-white head suggested that of a female
of his own species is an intriguing point and one that I fear will never
be solved.
The Muscovy, who did not, I fear, reciprocate his devotion, had
since the night of the massacre taken to roosting at the pond, returning
to the garden a few hours after dawn. The Sheldduck, being pinioned,
was of course unable to follow and his distress when she left each
evening was pitiful. First she would fly up on to the bird-bath. That
this was the first step was fully realized by the Sheldduck, and he
would at once evince great agitation. When she commenced to make
the head movements characteristic of a Muscovy about to fly, he would
run in circles, crying out in his hoarse sad voice, as if imploring her
to stay, and when she finally took wing would race over the lawn
and hurl himself into the air, only to crash heavily on mutilated wing.
His joy at her return each morning was unbounded, but I thought
then as I think still that the scales are weighted heavily against
the happiness of any pinioned bird that is paired to a full-winged
specimen.
A pair of Carolinas were purchased in the autumn of 1939. I had
worried a little as to how they would fare with Mallards and Muscovies
as pen-companions, but to my surprise they soon made themselves
not only respected but feared by the larger birds, their greater
manoeuvring powers proving more than a match for the extra weight
of their opponents. This seems to be the usual result when related
species of different sizes fight. A Barbary Dove can generally get the
better of a Wood Pigeon or Stock Dove, and a Kite is practically
helpless when attacked by a Kestrel.
The hard winter of 1939-1940 brought parties of Mandarin Ducks
nightly to the woodland streams near my home. Many, probably
most, were of course shot. This bird is not only beautiful and harmless,
but is said to have greatly decreased in its native haunts. Given the
least freedom from persecution there is little doubt that it would soon

establish itself in Britain. Indeed it is wonderful how it manages--
temporarily I fear--to maintain its numbers in spite of being shot
on sight. Two wounded Mandarin drakes were sold to me for $s.
and # 1 respectively. The former was dear at the price and my efforts
to save its life in vain. This bird had lost half of its upper mandible
at some previous date (the broken surfaces had long healed over)
and yet had evidently managed to feed itself since it was in fine
plumage and showed no signs of starvation.
The other bird had a wing injury which beyond preventing flight
did not much incommode it. After a few days it became as tame as
the other Ducks and I spent many an hour trying to decide whether
it or the Carolina was the more beautiful. In April both the Mallards
and the Carolinas began prospecting for nest-sites, and I was surprised
to find that the drakes took as keen an interest in this proceeding
as their mates. On the day the first Mallard laid her second egg
I was called up and for the next six years was away from home.
One disaster after another overtook my birds in my absence, and the
Ducks were the first casualties, being all destroyed by dogs and foxes
within the first few months.
Since then my experiences with waterfowl have been chiefly confined
to vicarious but delightful encounters with wild specimens. Teal in
hundreds covering the pools in the Cairo Zoo, indifferent alike to
the surrounding crowds and the hippopotamus ploughing the water
with its vast bulk. . . . My first wild Gadwall, flushed from a tiny
yard-long pool beneath a gnarled and twisted fig-tree in a Libyan
wadi. . . . Sheldduck on the grey mud-flats of a Kentish estuary,
shining bright as diamonds in the early morning sun . . . and the
Mallard that, like the poor, are always with us.
If it is true as we are given to understand--and indeed one cannot
see how it can be otherwise--that waterfowl are greatly on the decrease
taken as a whole, it is a very sad situation. The culpability of the
Icelandic Raven and various other destructive agents have frequently
been enlarged upon by the shooting devotees, most of whom consider
the number of wildfowl destroyed by " the man with the shoulder-
gun 55 as too small to be worthy of consideration. This I am not able
to dispute, although I frankly do not believe it holds good for most of
Europe when one considers the vast army of individuals with twelve-
bores as opposed to the number of working decoys for example.
One point I have not seen made, however, and that is the results that
shooting may have on birds not actually injured. There can be no
doubt that this form of taking birds has a far more demoralizing effect
on those that escape than any other, with the possible exception of
falconry, which is very little practised nowadays. It would be interest-
ing, and I think perhaps enlightening, if we could know just how many
waterfowl perish in hard winters directly as a result of starvation

In view of the interest expressed in the status of the Hawaiian Goose
or Nene, Branta (, Nesochen ) sandvicensis , at the recent meeting of the
International Committee for Bird Preservation in London, it may be
worthwhile here to discuss something of its present prospects.
Mr. Paul H. Baldwin, in the Condor (47, Jan., 1945, p. 27, and 49,
May-June, 1947, p. 108) has made a most interesting survey of the
ecology and food habits of this rare species. The information which
he has gathered together shows that the Nene was always a restricted
species occurring principally on the large island of Hawaii, and to a
very small extent on Maui, while records of the species on any other
of the islands of the Archipelago must be treated as accidents.
It is worth while recording that, as Baldwin reports, the bird has not
become rare only in recent years, but that the decline in numbers from
an original population in the thousands started in the 1820's, and that
by 1900 the species had become uncommon. By 1939 the Hawaii
National Park staff members proposed that fifty was probably the total
number for the species, but this number seems to have been an under-
estimate. There is evidence to show that on one of the two ranches
where the birds occur there were large enough flocks to indicate a
number greater than fifty in that year. However, it is likely that to-day
there are no more than fifty birds extant. A complex of factors seems
to have been responsible for the decline. Nene were shot in con-
siderable numbers by the first settlers. The introduction of the
mongoose in the 1880's was a crippling blow. Added to these have
been the effects of the burning and destruction of the lowland forests
and the enormous spread of cattle ranges. It is interesting, in view of
the decline in numbers, that Baldwin's evidence points to the continued
existence of a thinly spread population of Nene over a very wide range
of territory. For one reason or another the remaining birds have not
drawn together. One reason, of course, may be the tendency to
quarrelsomeness of the species. M. Delacour tells me that the males

of the pairs kept formerly by Blaauw were most pugnacious and killed
each other when pairs were kept together.
When I was in Honolulu in the autumn of 1946 I suggested to the
local authorities that something should be done to rear Nene through
caging or penning them up. I was told that this had been tried, and in
fact I had seen some hand-reared birds in 1939, but that there was a
lack of trained people to perform this task. There are two ranches on
Hawaii where the birds have been protected for many years, but the
populations there are static and have not been increasing in numbers.
Predators, rats, and mongooses, are very common in these inhabited
areas. Recently I have had some added correspondence about the
Nene and have been told that in the last two years the population has,
if anything, become less. Consequently the need for urgent measures
is greater than ever before.
It is my hope that through the co-operation of the Territorial
Government and the New York Zoological Society it may be possible
to secure some eggs of this almost vanished species and that we shall
be able to start a small captivity reared stock. Provided this stock does
well and increases, suitable conditions may some day be found in the
wild areas of Hawaii for reintroduction of these hand-reared birds.
What a triumph for aviculture this would be ! It is only unfortunate
that a combination of ill-luck and accident has prevented the con-
tinuation of the original captivity reared stock and let us hope that
a new effort will be crowned with better success.

In his opening address the Chairman said :--
" We are honoured this evening by the presence of Mr. Walter
Goodfellow. While not now a member of the Avicultural Society he
is one of the oldest living former members, having joined in June, 1897.
He has a very considerable reputation as a traveller, writer, and
collector. Before the Great War he made several visits to New Guinea
in search of Birds of Paradise, and successfully brought back alive
over twenty species. Amongst his discoveries was Mrs. Johnstone's
Lorikeet (Trichoglossus johnstonia ). He has had under his care almost
every species of the family Loriida brought to this country. Some of
the older aviculturists will remember the superb collection of 300
Tanagers, etc., brought from Ecuador in 1915." (In November, 1925,
he arrived in London with a collection containing twenty-seven Birds
of Paradise, of eight species, rare Fruit Pigeons, Lorikeets, etc. Many
of the rarities augmented Mr. Ezra's collection.)
Mr. A. E. Sibley, Hon. Secretary, National British Hardbill Society,
read a paper entitled " British Hardbills in Gage and Aviary ". He
showed himself fully conversant with his subject, and in the general
discussion that followed ably dealt with the numerous interesting
points raised.
Dr. Osman Hill was warmly congratulated on his recent marriage
to Mrs. Yvonne Burn.
The Chairman proposed the health of the King, together with that
of Princess Elizabeth, whom he referred to as an enthusiastic breeder of
Budgerigars.
The next meeting of the Club is on 14th January, 1948, when
Mr. Walter Higham will show his colour film Hungarian Featherland.
All members are recommended to make special efforts to attend the
showing of this very remarkable film.

Warblers ( Phylloscopus trochilus). A hybrid Rosella X Red-rumped Parrakeet was
bred in one of the outside flights of the Parrot House. One would imagine this to
be a not uncommon cross, but there are only two or three previous recorded events.

September, 1947.--The new arrivals were only twenty-five in number. The most
important was a Javan Pond Heron (Ardeola speciosa), a species new to the collection,
brought home by Mr. W. J. C. Frost.
Other interesting newcomers were six Scarlet Lories ( Domicella garrula) and one
Ornate Lorikeet ( Trichoglossus ornatus) deposited; two Indian Green-winged Doves
(Chalcophaps indica) and one European Roller ( Coracias garrulus). A Quail (Coturnix

was duly presented to the Society.
The additions at Whipsnade included many home-bred birds--seven Chinese
Geese, five Canada Geese, two Hybrid Canada x Domestic Geese, four Muscovy
Ducks, thirty Mallard, and forty Red Jungle Fowl. Obtained by purchase were
one Pallas's Eared Pheasant, two Emperor Geese J 1 $, twelve Carolina Ducks, and
four Red-crested Pochards.

then draws all the feathers of his head and neck quite tight, with the exception of
the crimson gorget which stands out in a bunch. The scarlet upper tail-coverts
and scarlet feathers of the rump and lower back are then raised up, sometimes into
one point, sometimes two ; it is a wonderful example of making the most of himself.
A pair, which we have had for six years, were most determined sitters, the hen sitting
practically from April to August, but with no result. The nest is built deep in a
hole of an apple tree of green strips of Aucuba leaves, the strips when cut off being
conveyed into the nesting-hole by being inserted into the upper tail-coverts and
feathers of the rump. The little hen looks very strange flying into her nest with a
bunch of green leaves trailing behind her. The female is much larger than the
male, and the latter does not get any of his colour until two years old, and not the
full colour until four years."

An Important Collection of Birds from Central America for the New York
Zoo
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998817863636364" page_id="56289355"  page_num="233" year="" vol="">
The most important collection of birds and mammals that the New York Zoological
Society ever received from Central America was first exhibited on 6th September.
The stars of the collection were a female Yapock, an almost legendary Central
American water opossum that has never before been exhibited alive, and which
few white men have ever seen ; the Three-wattled Bell-bird, a Sickle-bill Humming-
bird, male Bare-necked Umbrella Birds, Costa Rican Quetzals, and 37 Humming-
birds of 17 species--six of them never before exhibited anywhere, and four more
new to the Bronx Zoo.
The entire collection was gathered in Costa Rica by Charles Cordier, staff collector
for the New York Zoological Society, in four and a half months. Altogether he
brought back 111 specimens of 52 species, 21 of which are " first timers " for the
Bronx Zoo and 10 " firsts " anywhere.
The bird rarities in Mr. Cordier's collection are headed by the Three-wattled
Bell-birds, an adult pair and a young male. About the size of a Crow, they are
chestnut and white, with fleshy, black, inch-long threads of skin, or wattles, pro-
jecting from the forehead and from each corner of the mouth. The function of
these wattles is not understood, and it is hoped that observations made in the Zoo
will reveal their purpose. Like other but less strange-appearing bell-birds of the
American tropics, the Three-wattled species has a ringing, bell-like voice that can
be heard for miles across jungle valleys.
Mr. Cordier brought Bare-necked Umbrella Birds to the Bronx Zoo in 1942,
the first that had ever been exhibited, and the last of the males died last year, leaving
only one of the less spectacular females. His new collection includes two fine males
with the spreading black top-knot that gives the bird its name.
Quetzals from Costa Rica have been exhibited at the Bronx Zoo before, but never
in such numbers as is now possible, with seven specimens. Quetzals are known
as " the most beautiful birds in the New World " because of their iridescent green-
and-gold plumage.
Two Nun Birds, never exhibited before, are dark grey with a white mask around
the face.
The most spectacular of all the birds, even though on a small scale, are the new
Hummingbirds and particularly eight Costa Rican Snow-caps. These are tiny,
wine-rust-coloured hummers with snowy white crowns which, in certain lights,
are afire with opalescent tints. Five male birds are now exhibited in a thorn-
planted compartment in the Bronx Zoo's "Jewel Room", together with samples
of the other " first time " hummers. The rarest of all is Salvin's Sickle-bill, a medium-
sized Hummingbird with a sharply-curved beak an inch and a quarter long. It has
never been exhibited before.
The Sickle-bill is one of the rarities that Mr. Cordier was most anxious to get
when he went to Costa Rica last April, and in expectation that he would catch it
in his nets, he had special feeding bottles made in New York. They have extra-long,
upward-pointing spouts, so the Sickle-bill can conveniently introduce its curved
beak. They were a great success, and the bird started feeding a few minutes after
it was caught.

THE STATUS OF WILD PHEASANTS IN THE FAR EAST
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993122" page_id="56289356"  page_num="234" year="" vol="">
In reply to Mr. Alastair Morrison's letter in the previous number of the Avicultural
Magazine. It will be noted that I did not commit myself by stating that the war in
the Far East had definitely had a noticeable effect on wild life in the region. I naturally
presumed that such was possible and that there would at least be some territorial
changes owing to the large troop concentrations and heavy gunfire in parts of the
country inhabited by certain species. It is appreciated that facts are preferable to
surmise when these can be given, but surely a little surmise does no harm if shown as
such and not cloaked in the disguise of fact. I little thought my remarks conjured up
pictures of the 14th Army or the " Sons of Heaven . . . relentlessly pursuing the
elusive Pheasant ..." with Sten guns, etc., and hasten to add that my main object
was to impress on Pheasant lovers some likely ways by which these birds may have
become scarce, and to drive home to them the necessity for breeding to the maximum
from the stocks still maintained in these islands. If I have unwittingly put my foot
in it, I offer my apologies and as I cannot speak from first-hand experience in the Far
East, I accept my admonishment from one who can.

The following extracts from letters I have recently received may serve to illustrate
how the passage quoted by Mr. Morrison may have contained a grain of fact. The
first, from Mr. W. C. Duyzend, of Zeist, Holland, says : " ... all my birds were
killed and eaten by the Germans . . .," and Miss E. T. Greenyer, of Bolney, states:
" . . . most of mine were destroyed by the troops quartered here. . . ." To give a
further example, a personal experience that came my way during the war was at an
R.A.F. Gunnery School, where I saw seabirds, including Cormorants and Guillemots,
used for machine-gun practice by the instructors. Now, if incidents such as these
happened in civilized countries, is it not possible for them to have also happened in
the jungle ? Granting that owing to the nature of the terrain, only an occasional
bird fell, if that bird was of a species numerically weak I think the effects would tell.
I am glad to hear that Mr. Morrison considers these lovely creatures have not
suffered from the war, and it is to be hoped that whilst man was busy fighting man,
they found respite and increased accordingly.

In his notes on the genus Loriculus in last month's Avicultural Magazine (p. 169)
Mr. Griffiths inquires whether any species has been bred in England. I know of no
record of complete success. The London Zoo is often credited with the breeding of the
Golden-backed (C. chrysonotus ), but the " breeding " is really a " hatching ". The
facts of the event are that in the autumn of 1871 several eggs were laid. Two of these
were placed in a Budgerigar's nest and one was eventually hatched. The young one
was not reared. The Duke ofBedford ( A.M. , 1931, 238, 299) describes two unsuccessful
breeding attempts in his aviaries. A pair of Halmahera (C. amahilis) nested and pro-
duced three infertile eggs ; and a Worcester's (C. chrysonotus worcesteri ) female mated
to a Golden-backed laid clutches of three and four infertile eggs.
