BREEDING THE BLACK-HEADED SIBIA

Heterophasia desgodinsi
by Nigel Hewston
The sibias of the genus Heterophasia are medium-sized crested babblers
from south-east Asia which are much more arboreal than many other babblers
which appear in aviculture. The sibia which has become most familiar to
European aviculturists in recent years is the Black-headed Heterophasia
desgodinsi. Those imported from China are of the nominate race and are
sleek birds about 9in (22cm) long with grey upperparts, glossy blue-black
head and short crest, white throat, pale grey breast, white belly, pinkish grey
flanks, black wings with a white bar and a fairly long black and grey tail.
The eyes, bill and legs are black. Males and females are identical in
appearance but the male has a pleasant song of eight notes, falling in pitch
rather mournfully at the end.
There has been some understandable confusion among aviculturists about
names for sibias. When H. desgodinsi first appeared in British aviculture it
was generally called the Black-capped Sibia by dealers to distinguish it from
H. capistrata, the pinkish rufous sibia with a black head from the western
Himalayas which had previously been widely kept as the Black-headed Sibia,
though Howard and Moore (1984) refer to it as the Black-capped. To add to
the confusion, a photograph of H. desgodinsi in Cage &amp; Aviary Birds was
captioned as the Grey Sibia H. gracilis. Howard and Moore and King and
Dickinson (1975) use the name Black-headed Sibia for H. melanoleuca which
they consider conspecific with H. desgodinsi , but C. R. Robson (pers. comm.
1998) in a forthcoming field guide to south-east Asian birds, sensibly splits
H. melanoleuca , which he calls the Dark-backed Sibia, from H. desgodinsi
(the Black-headed Sibia) and uses the name Rufous Sibia for H. capistrata.
Incidentally, the bird known until now as the Rufous-backed Sibia H.
annectens , which has very recently appeared in captivity in Britain, is now
thought to be not a sibia at all but a minla.
I obtained my first bird in November 1995. It had been hatched in 1993
by Peter Walker who published details of this first British captive breeding

(Walker, 1994). This bird came as a male so I acquired another established
bird which had not been heard to sing in about two years with its previous
owner. These two agreed well but the following summer passed with no
song or other breeding activity and I became convinced that I had two
females. In February 1997 a dealer offered an established true pair, and
though sceptical about dealers' true pairs, one bird was definitely singing
so these two were installed in the flight next to the females. After about two
weeks the obvious male became aggressive to the other bird so these two
were separated and each housed with one of the females. Both immediately
began to sing so I now had two pairs. They remained in adjacent flights,
both pairs sharing with Red-crested Turacos Tauraco erythrolophus, Silver-
beaked Tanagers Ramphocelus carbo and Omei Shan Liocichlas Liocichla
omeiensis plus White-collared Yuhinas Yuhina diademata in the case of one
pair and with Japanese Waxwings Bombycilla japonica in the case of the
other and both pairs at various times with Palawan Peacock Pheasants
Polyplectron emphanum, Necklaced Hill Partridge Arborophila torqueola
or Wonga Pigeons Leucosarcia melanoleuca.
These are active and acrobatic birds which are obviously largely
insectivorous and catch a lot of their food on the wing (they have a useful
liking for wasps), but they readily take a variety of foods in captivity including
Universal Food, soaked mynah pellets, chopped fruit (especially pear),
soaked sultanas and mealworms. In the wild they, and other sibias, also
take nectar and berries (C. R. Robson pers. comm. 1998), frequenting as
they do forest edges where flowering and fruiting trees and shrubs are more
numerous than in dense forest. They are hill birds, and though not occurring
up into the coniferous zone like the Rufous Sibia, they are quite hardy and
can be kept outdoors all year round. My aviaries have enclosed shelters
with minimal heating and the sibias have usually used these for roosting in
winter but have sometimes roosted outside with no apparent ill effects in
the parts of the aviaries which are roofed and screened on three sides.
In June 1997 the pair which included the captive-bred female built a
rather flimsy nest, mainly from coconut fibre, in the base of a large but very
open willow basket in a fork in some dead juniper branches about 1.5m
(5ft) above the ground. One egg, blue with indistinct red-brown blotches,
was laid on July 5th. The female looked sick after laying and incubation did
not commence until the 8th, apparently by the female only, and was very
erratic, even after the male started to assist two days later. After a couple
more days, incubation became much more consistent but was again carried
out almost exclusively by the female (now looking much better) for the rest
the incubation period. The egg hatched on July 24th, and the chick was fed
by both parents on insects caught in the aviary plus waxworms which were
taken by both parents and white-skinned mini, then regular mealworms which

were taken only by the male. When the chick was nine days old grasshoppers
were introduced. These were offered in an aquarium, and taken only by the
female, probably because the wax worms ran out at this point. Grasshoppers
are obviously not a natural food for these arboreal birds, and she was initially
unsure how to deal with them and took a very long time to remove the legs
etc., before taking them to the nest, in contrast to Omei Shan Liocichlas
which deal with grasshoppers very quickly. Her efficiency with and
enthusiasm for grasshoppers increased quickly and she continued to feed
these to the chick while the male fed mealworms. Both parents took food
items to the nest one or at most two at a time, and always turned them so that
they lay along rather than across the bill before approaching the nest, also in
contrast to liocichlas which carry beakfuls of insects puffin-style to the nest.
The chick fledged at 17 days, flying and perching well and apparently almost
as large as its parents but with its tail about one-third grown. It had a pale
yellow gape and less, and duller, white in the wing than the adults. A few
days after fledging both parents were seen to feed the chick with sultanas. It
was still being fed with insects and mynah pellets three weeks after fledging,
by which time its tail was fully grown. In September the female once again
looked sick and was found to have a distended abdomen, a condition which
I now realised had been present throughout the breeding season but which I
had noted as a change in her stance and plumage without identifying the
cause. She did not respond to treatment and post mortem examination
showed gut abnormalities probably caused by an earlier alimentary blockage
or injury.
This pair showed little aggression to other birds in the aviary, which
measured 4.25m x 4.85m (14ft x 16ft) with a 1.5m x 1.7m (5ft x 5ft 6in)
shelter. The female of a pair of Silver-beaked Tanagers would have been
killed if not removed, but only because she insisted on trying to build a nest
close to the sibias' nest. A male Omei Shan Liocichla was also removed
when it was seen inspecting the sibia chick very closely on the day of
hatching. The male tanager, female liocichla and seven wax wings were
ignored unless they were close to the nest. There were no turacos in the
aviary during breeding.
The young bird over-wintered with its father and in the spring of 1998
they showed some interest in nest sites, but only seemed to visit the sites
independently. In May they fought and the younger bird was removed to an
adjacent flight. I had not heard the bird singing but suspected that it might
be a male so was reluctant to put them together again. Subsequent observation
failed to produce any definite indication of sex and I am now sure that this
bird was a female.
The other pair got no further than carrying nesting material in 1997, but
early in May 1998 became seriously interested in building a nest on the end

of a large perch at the most exposed end of the aviary. After a few days it
was apparent that they were determined to use this site so a wire basket was
fixed up, screened from rain and predators with correx and minimal conifer
cover. This was adopted immediately and incubation of a clutch of three
eggs began ten days later. This pair, housed in a 7.3m x 3.6m (24ft x 12ft)
aviary with a 2.4m x 1.2m (8ft x 4ft) shelter, were much more aggressive to
other birds. A White-collared Yuhina was found dead the day after the nest
site was put up, so its mate was quickly removed. A pair of Silver-beaked
Tanagers and their newly fledged chick were next on the hit list and these
were also removed. Some male liocichlas had already been taken out when
the tanagers nested to reduce competition for livefood, leaving only a pair
of Red-crested Turacos and a single Wonga Pigeon. The sibias confined the
turacos to one end of the aviary (fortunately the end containing the turacos'
nest and access to food and shelter) for the whole of their nesting period.
The pigeon, surprisingly, was usually tolerated quite close to the nest.
After 14 days incubation by both parents one chick hatched in the morning
and the second was hatching in the evening. The third chick was assumed
to have hatched the next day. On the first day the parents were catching
flies etc., but not taking white mini mealworms, but they were soon taking
waxworms, white mini and regular mealworms and even brown-skinned
mealworms when necessary.
Fledging was the most difficult period. The first chick fledged on June
10th at 15 days. It appeared to have returned to the nest at night, but when
the other two fledged the next day they could not be persuaded to do likewise
nor to roost anywhere else safe. Wherever one settled the parents would
clear the area of turacos, and the turacos in escaping would disturb, or in
one case attack, one of the others. The weather was also far from pleasant
and the chicks were placed in a small cage in the shelter overnight. The
next morning the parents were shut in the shelter and the chicks let out of
the cage. After a week the pop-hole was opened but the first chick to venture
out took flight when the pigeon flew, hit the wire and fell down concussed.
It looked close to death but after a while in a box it was able to stand and
was released back into the shelter (where the other sibias had been re-
confined) and made a complete recovery. The next day the pop-hole was
re-opened but only slightly so that the adult sibias could get out but the
turacos and pigeon could not get in, and the young sibias were unlikely to
get out.
This worked well and the next day the adults were adding material to the
nest. This pair also used mainly coconut fibre, but also grass, moss and
some finer material for lining. They relined the nest, so substantially that
they really built a second nest on the first one. After a few days the young
birds were also given access to the flight. On June 29th an egg was laid

from the perch, and another laid in the nest four days later was incubated for
two days before disappearing. To avoid disturbance by the young birds
these were removed on July 11th, about a month after fledging, but another
egg laid four days later also disappeared. A final clutch of two eggs laid on
July 25th and 26th or 26th and 27th did produce a chick which hatched on
August 10th and fledged on the 25th. This bird unfortunately died with a
respiratory infection at the end of October.
The three first-round young continued to thrive and proved to be males.
Two were singing by the end of July and the third early in August. The first
started quietly but soon became an accomplished and vigorous singer, the
second started with the first half of the song and gradually progressed to full
song, while the third stuck with the first half. During this period these three
were housed together (with no friction), in sight and sound of their parents,
the other adult male and the 1997 female which may have stimulated them
to sing so persistently at such an early age.
I assume that the behaviour of the second pair was more typical, with
incubation shared, though Walker records that only the female of his pair
incubated. Both my pairs chose relatively, in one case conspicuously, exposed
nest sites when more secluded sites were available. Neil Owen (pers. comm.
1998) also bred H. desgodinsi in 1998 after removing two birds from a large
well planted aviary because they had shown so little interest in breeding
that he thought they were two females. On being moved into a relatively
bare former parrot aviary the male began to sing immediately, and the pair
had a nest in a few days and reared two broods.
I was able to exchange young birds with Neil Owen and have also passed
on young and adult birds to another experienced Avicultural Society member
who already has some unrelated birds. I have reluctantly decided not to
continue with this species as it is too aggressive when breeding for my
community aviaries. It is a good subject for establishment by keepers who
have flights for individual pairs. H. capistrata bred in Britain from 1925
(Sheriff, 1925) through to the 1970s when it bred for Gordon Illsley, Chester
Zoo and R. Franklin, and into the 1980s with Alan Griffiths, but seems
unlikely to be with us much longer. If a few breeders take an interest in H.
desgodinsi it may persist in our aviaries after the current trade boom in birds
from China, which surely cannot be sustainable, has subsided.

Burhinus o. oedicnemus AT POZNAN ZOO
by Piotr Cwiertnia
Introduction
The nominate race of the Stone Curlew Burhinus oedicnemus oedicnemus
has become one of the most endangered species of birds in Europe. In spite
of a still quite large European population estimated at 32,690-45,704
(37,299), there has been a marked decrease in overall numbers, and in many
areas it has become extinct recently (Nipkow, 1997; Cramp, 1983). Only
extensive activities undertaken in Great Britain leading to the conservation
of this species in the wild through strict nest protection (Green, 1986) has
resulted in a slow increase (del Hoyo et al. 1996). In Poland the number of
breeding Stone Curlews has decreased critically during the last few decades
(Tomialojc, 1990). Therefore it is important to perfect captive breeding
techniques for the Stone Curlew, as this may soon be the only chance to
safeguard the survival of this species.
At the end of 1997, there were 73 Stone Curlews in 13 zoological gardens,
56 of which were captive bred (ISIS, 1997). Between 1958 and 1992, 211
Stone Curlews were hatched in 17 institutions (races not specified in the
International Zoo Yearbook). All of the Stone Curlews hatched in the 1997
originated from just six pairs, of which two were in Poznan , and the other
four were maintained in Cleres (France), Paignton (UK), London (UK) and
Vienna (Austria) (ISIS, 1997). The largest number of Stone Curlew ever
hatched (129), was at Great Witchingham (UK) ( International Zoo
Yearbook). The original pair came from the wild (Wayre, 1971). It is likely
that the majority of Stone Curlews living in captivity at present originate
from this pair.
The History of Keeping Stone Curlews at Poznan Zoo
The first Stone Curlews arrived in Poznan Zoological Garden on October
21st 1986, from the Norfolk Wildlife Park at Great Witchingham. There
were three pairs, probably bred there in 1986. Unfortunately, during 1987
two females and one male died. Two more females were imported from
Great Witchingham on February 25th 1988, but both died the same year. To
provide some much needed additional genetic variability, in 1996 we
imported from Ramat Gan, in Israel, three birds injured on migration and
not suitable for release.
The first pair of Stone Curlew (PI) was formed in 1989. They laid two
fertile eggs, and both chicks were reared. They laid their next clutch in
1992 after a two-year break, and subsequently laid regularly every year until

1997, when both birds died. The second pair (P2) was established in 1993
from an individual originated from Great Witchingham and one reared in
Poznan, but this pair laid infertile eggs only. The third pair (P3) was formed
in 1996 from birds reared in our zoo, and in that year this pair laid 10 eggs
from which two chicks were raised. These birds belong to second generation
raised in our zoo and third or more generation raised in captivity.
From Stone Curlew raised at Poznan, in 1997 we created a fourth pair
(P4) which laid two infertile eggs, this time inside the shed. This pair was
the first to incubate their eggs themselves. Shortly before the completion of
the incubation period, one of eggs was swapped for a newly hatched chick,
but this ended in failure, when two days later the chick was killed by the
foster parents. In the same year, two additional pairs were formed, one (P5)
laid four eggs but all were broken by the birds themselves, and the other
pair (P6) failed to lay. The latter was the third pair created during the year
and involved the birds from Israel.

The birds are not sexed and there is the possibility that pairs P2, P4 and P6 are homosexual
Housing
Upon arrival in our zoo the birds were placed in cages measuring 4.9m x
4.9m x 3m high (approx. 16ft x 16ft x 9ft lOin high). These are covered with
wire mesh, with the rear walls covered with straw mats or wooden planks.
There is a den measuring lm x 3m x 2.5 m high (approx. 3ft 3in x 9ft lOin
x 8ft 2in high), which is heated in cold weather so as not to allow the
temperature to fall below 0*C (32*F). The cages are furnished with tussock
grass, pine branches, and other materials to allow the birds to hide from
visitors, and there is a shallow pool but the birds never use it.
The first pair created from birds originating from Great Witchingham,
and fourth pair created from birds hatched in our zoo, have been kept in this
kind of accommodation as well as a number of young birds hatched here.
Paired birds are moved to off-show breeding cages measuring 2m x 3m x
2m high (approx. 6ft 6in x 9ft lOin x 6ft 6in high). The sides are covered
with wire netting and at the back of each cage there is a small room measuring

lm x 2m x 2m high (approx. 3ft Sin x 6ft 6in x 6ft 6in high). The cages are
in a row, with five cages placed together and all occupied by Stone Curlews.
Food
The adult birds are fed once a day for five days a week. The food consists
of cooked egg, cooked rice, white cheese, ground meat and ground (minced)
fish. In addition, from time to time the birds also receive small laboratory
mice Mus musculus. The preferred food is mice and then cooked egg and
ground meat. We do not add any mineral/vitamin supplements to the food.
Breeding
All unpaired and young birds we try to keep together in a communal
cage. Birds aged three years (which is when breeding activity usually begins)
are allowed to select a partner of their own choosing. A mated pair begin to
chase away other birds and is removed to another cage. A few days before
egg laying begins, the birds dig a shallow depression in the ground. This is
usually located in the same place every year.
The original pair chose a place near the cage perimeter, close to the path
used by visitors and this was a reason why we never left them to incubate
their own eggs. The third pair chose a place in the middle of the cage, but
this pair usually lay their eggs outside the nest which could be because of
the small dimensions of the cage. In 1997, we tried to leave the eggs with
this pair for them to incubate and hatch but this ended in failure. The eggs
of the fifth pair (P5) were destroyed by the birds themselves immediately
after being laid.
The breeding season starts in March or April. The earliest clutch was
laid on March 10th. The second egg in a clutch is laid 1-4 days after the
first, with two days being the usual interval. The second clutch is laid 9-57
days later, with 12 days later being the most usual. Pairs usually lay two
clutches, each with two eggs. However in 1995, after moving the original
pair to another cage, they laid four clutches totalling eight eggs, but the next
year this pair laid only one egg. In 1997 this pair laid three clutches. High
egg laying characterised the third pair, which in 1996 laid 10 eggs, and in
1997, 20 eggs! Information about hatching results is summarised in Table 2.
The eggs are artificially incubated at 37.2*C (99*F). Incubation lasts for
25-28 days. All Stone Curlew chicks in our zoological gardens, apart from
one unsuccessful effort, have been hand-reared. After hatching the young
are kept in bowls, with sand on the bottom. The temperature is maintained
by an infra-red heater at 30*C (86*F). We start feeding from the second day.
At the beginning they receive dead cricket nymphs Acheta domesticus and
the larvae of mealworms Tenebrio molitor. At the same time they receive
food containing cooked rice, white cheese, ground meat and boiled egg.

When the chicks are a few days old they actively search for food, and at this
time we start to feed them live crickets. During the course of the chicks 5
growth we change the proportions of food, slowly decreasing the quantity
of insects. After two weeks we move the chicks to rearing cages. If birds
grow up healthy, which is usually the case, we do not use any mineral/

The main cause of death among chicks has been related to incubation
(the yolk not being absorbed properly) with some chicks also being lost due
to splayed legs. With adult birds the main cause of death has been through
injuries, with three caused by predator attacks. In addition, two have died
of avian tuberculosis.
Conclusion
Stone Curlews easily adapt to different habitat (cages here are in forest)
and food. Hand-reared birds form pairs easily with little sign of imprinting.
To summarise, Stone Curlews are easy to keep and rear and provide a
welcome addition to the collection of conservation minded zoos. Their
breeding may in the near future have a definitive conservation value.

Summary
The Black Crake Amaurornis flavirostris possesses an unusual and
fascinating cooperative breeding strategy. The crake group at Disney's
Animal Kingdom (DAK) in Florida is comprised of two adult males and a
single adult female. This original group has successfully bred, on display,
in the African Aviary. The crakes share the aviary with 26 other African
bird species and have incubated and hatched eggs at various locations

raising several clutches of chicks, the crake breeding results supported the
hypothesis that a larger number of participants, supporting the cooperative
breeding effort, results in more chicks being raised. The data collected also
demonstrated a significant decrease in the amount of time (days in age) in
which nestlings and juveniles began to feed and care for their younger
siblings. Our data also supports the idea that nestlings and juveniles take a
more active role in the cooperative breeding association at a younger age
when they have a larger peer group from which to learn.
Taxonomy, Morphology, Natural Distribution and Behaviour
The Black Crake is a member of the Order Gruiformes and is sometimes
included in Porzana, or placed in the monospecific genus Limnocorax, but
is inseparable from Amauromis on skeletal characters (del Hoyo et al. 1996).
The overall coloration of the Black Crake is jet black above with softer
charcoal black extending from beneath the beak through the belly to the
vent. Being protectively clad, shy and secretive makes the Black Crake
well suited for life in its shadowy habitat. It is approximately 20cm - 23cm
(Tin - 8in) in length. The crake's black coloration contrasts dramatically
with it red long-toed feet and legs, chartreuse beak and orange-red iris. Both
sexes look alike with the female being slightly larger.
The species is indigenous to tropical Africa and is widely distributed in
areas where there are not only marshes, swamps and dense wetland
vegetation, but also forested regions. The crakes' compressed and narrow
bodies allow them to live secretively in their habitat. An effective hunter,
the Black Crake runs and flies swiftly across water plants and dense
vegetation, appearing as an indistinct small blur. Within its natural habitat
the Black Crake is likely to feed upon insects and their larvae, seeds of
aquatic plants, water snails, small fish and other assorted aquatic animals.
The Black Crake breeding biology involves the cooperative efforts of an
extended family including juvenile family members and unrelated non-
breeding adult birds. Cooperative breeding is relatively rare; it is currently
known to occur in about 220 of the (roughly) 9,000 species of birds, and a
smaller number of mammals and fish (Koenig and Stacey, 1990).
Cooperative Breeding in Birds
A cooperative breeding association is a reproductive system in which
one or more members of a social group provide care to young that are not
their own offspring. The aid-givers may be non-breeding adults and juveniles,
in which case they are usually called 'helpers' or 'auxiliaries' (Koenig and
Stacey, 1990). Care given usually includes providing food and may involve
other parental-type behaviours as well, including territorial defence, nest
construction, incubation and defence against predators. When observing

the cooperative breeding association among birds, one imagines that the
juvenile assistants are actually apprentices, practising skills they will later
use in their own nesting attempts. 'Helpers' or 'auxiliaries' themselves are
beneficiaries of the cooperative breeding arrangement, not only by increasing
their efficiency and experience when rearing their own broods but also
because they have access to the resources and safety of the parent birds'
territory.
We shall use the following definitions, as described by Skutch (1987)
when describing the members of the cooperative breeding association of
the Black Crake.
From hatching until it leaves the nest, a bird is a 'nestling '. 'Fledgling '
or 'chick' designates a bird that has left the nest but is still dependent on
parental care. In the months immediately following the attainment of
independence, a bird is a 'juvenile '. In the breeding season directly following
that in which it was hatched, when it is approximately one year old, it becomes
a 'yearling '. 'Non-breeding adult ' designates all full-grown birds not directly
engaged in reproduction, whether they are or are not physiologically able
to breed - a point often difficult to determine. 'Breeding adults ' are mature
individuals engaged in the production of their own descendants. They may
be about a year old, and therefore 'yearlings' but to avoid confusion we
shall reserve this designation for individuals who do not breed, those who
in many cooperative nesting associations are the most numerous class of
helpers.
Skutch lists intraspecific helpers in reproductive activities as: nestling
helpers, juvenile helpers, yearling helpers, non-breeding adult helpers, and
breeding helpers further separated into unilateral helpers and mutual helpers.
Unilateral helpers are those individuals that assist others with no immediate
reward (although their association with their beneficiaries may aid them in
various ways) and are the most frequent kind of helper; as juveniles or
yearlings they are the mainstay of many cooperative breeding associations.
Mutual helpers are those that help in some aspect of the cooperative breeding
association and also receive help in their production of descendents. All
members of a cooperative group become mutual helpers, for they contribute
to each other's welfare in diverse ways.
Young Black Crakes remain with their parents, on or in the vicinity of
the home territory, guided by adults and older siblings and shielded by them
from many dangers. Like most cooperative breeders, they reside throughout
the year on the defended territory. As described by Skutch (1987), advanced
cooperative breeding birds, like the Black Crake, tend to lack colourful
plumage. Often they are black, brown or grey. He goes on to theorise that
subdued coloration and the absence of conspicuous sexual differences help
reduce sexual jealousy among closely associated adults. Aggressive

interactions among Black Crakes in the Disney Animal collection are
uncommon and at present the group dwells in harmony.
Introduction: The Black Crake Habitat at DAK
At Disney's Animal Kingdom the Black Crakes are housed in a very
large, densely planted aviary perfectly suited to a bird that one might feel
prefers as little disturbance as possible in order to exist comfortably. By
nature the species is secretive but we have found the birds capable of adjusting
to conditions that include being visited and watched by several thousand
visitors each day. Our birds have revealed themselves to be uncommonly
bold and territorial guardians when holding their ground against larger birds
such as Vulturine Guineafowl Acryllium vulturinum, attacking even giants
like the occasional human being that may enter the vicinity of their nest.
The African Aviary at DAK covers an area 50m long x 20m wide x 19m
high (approx. 164ft long x 65ft wide x 62ft high) and includes mature trees
that create a nearly unbroken canopy overhead. A two-storey waterfall pours
into pools at two different levels, intentionally flooding areas which become
'tidal zones'. A path meanders through the centre of the aviary allowing
visitors a close encounter over 140 individual specimens of 28 avian species.
DAK purchased the original captive-reared crake group, comprised of
two males and a single female, from the Sedgwick County Zoo, Wichita,
Kansas, in November 1997. In February 1998 the crakes were introduced
to their new habitat following a period of quarantine and then an introduction
protocol which involves placing the birds in a 'howdy' cage on the second
floor of the aviary habitat. After being released it was not surprising that the
crakes chose the area closest to the waterfall and pools as their new residence.
One of the areas described earlier as a 'tidal zone', a flooded area planted
with rice grass Oryza spp., was selected by the birds as their favoured territory.
Upon introduction the rice grass in this area was only 12in (approx. 30cm)
tall with the water level in the area being up to Sin (75mm) in depth. This
rice paddy grows along one side of a bridge that allows visitors to cross the
largest pool. Other aquatic birds that share the crakes' habitat include: African
Jaganas Actophilomis africanus, Pygmy Geese Nettapus auritus, White-
backed Ducks Thalassornis leuconotus, Hadada Ibis Hagedashia hagedash
brevirostris, Hottentot Teal Anas hottentota and Hammerkop Scopus umbretta
plus a species of fish - the Tilapia Oreochromis variabilis.
Competition between species remains minimal to non-existent and this
is likely to be due to the immense size of the aviary, the diversity of species,
the birds' gradual introduction to the habitat, and individual species'
populations. The arrangement and quantity of feeding stations also reduces
aggressive interactions between species. Close monitoring of all avian
specimens by aviary staff allows for quick action to be taken should problems
arise.

The Black Crakes at DAK
The Black Crakes at DAK have laid six clutches of eggs in the months
of May, June, August, September and October. The first five clutches
consisted of four eggs, the sixth contained five eggs and was replaced with
dummy eggs. The first three clutches produced one chick each; the female
abandoned incubation within 48 hours of the first chick hatching. It is
theorised that more chicks would have hatched in at least the third clutch if
the female had continued incubating (two eggs in this clutch contained fully
developed embryos that were near to the point of hatching, if not already
pipping). The fourth clutch consisted of four eggs which all successfully
hatched and the resulting chicks were then reared by the group. The fifth
nest produced two chicks. The sixth clutch was replaced by plastic dummy
eggs that were readily accepted and 'incubated' by the birds even though
they were half the size of real crake eggs. One adult mate became more
alienated from the 'alpha' breeding nucleus as more chicks were hatched
and reared, eventually becoming completely peripheral from the territory
and therefore the group.
The nesting sites chosen by our crakes have been among tall rice grass
and in dense vegetation, such as Parlour Palm Chameadorea elegans clusters
and fallen limbs of Australian Tree Fern Cyathea australis. The 'alpha' pair
of crakes have been the primary nest builders of the group. The crakes pull
the long broad leaves of the rice grass, or palm fronds, into a central area,
thereby layering or weaving together a firm nest platform. Often these
platforms have been built 2-12in (5cm-30.5cm) above the surface of the
water. Those built in the low shrubbery and palm clusters have been up to
8ft (2.4m) above the ground. At present, having deserted the immediate
water areas, the birds are nest building in a Queen Palm Tree, more than
30ft (9.1m) above the ground. After building the initial nest platform, our
crakes have lined the nest bowl with dry bamboos and eucalyptus leaves.
Juvenile Black Crakes occasionally contribute by offering dried leaves to
line the nest.
The female crake lays four to six eggs at the rate of one per day. The
eggs are creamy-brown in colour with light brown speckles and are 23.5mm-
25mm in diameter and 30mm-32.5mm in length. Each adult bird took turns
incubating the eggs and occasionally was joined by another adult bird,
nestling or juvenile with incubation lasting approximately 21 days. It has
taken our broods of chicks 24-72 hours to hatch. With earlier nests our
adult birds left the nest within 24 hours of the first chick hatching. In
successive nests, our female remained brooding the chicks for up to four
days, giving the unhatched eggs time to hatch. While remaining at the nest
for this length of time the chicks that hatched earlier have gone for 'walks'
within close proximity to the nest, all the while being brooded and fed by

older nestlings, juveniles and adult birds. After the female left the nest
much of her time was spent brooding the newly hatched chicks, but she
soon left the chick-raising responsibilities to other group members and
selected a new nest site in which to lay her next clutch of eggs. During the
incubation process the 'alpha' male built one or two brood nests near to
where the clutch was being incubated. Our crakes' first two clutches were
laid in more distant locations, away from the aviary pools and rice grass,
largely out of our view. Chicks that were hatched in these more secluded
nests were brought to the vicinity of the aviary pools and brooded in dense
vegetation. Later clutches were hatched and reared in nests built just above
the surface of the water in the rice grass, within clear view of aviary staff
and visitors.
Defence of territory, eggs and young have been behaviours observed
among adult and juvenile crakes over the age of three months. Skutch (1987)
explains that juvenile birds participate in the group breeding effort with less
diligence and efficiency than yearlings and older birds. In nest defence,
especially against human intruders, youngsters often protest more vehemently
and take greater risks than older birds.
Complete mutual helpers share in every stage of nest building, incubation
and rearing. Very few of our juvenile crakes fill this category. Only the
'alpha' male of the adult breeding pair has been observed fulfilling all of the
characteristics of the mutual helper. This 'alpha' male has dominated each
of the tasks that make up the cooperative breeding effort, from nest building
to chick rearing. The female of our 'alpha' pair was the main care-giver for
the first three days, partaking in a major portion of chick feeding and
brooding, but soon left the task of immediate care to the 'alpha' male and
juveniles. She then began to lay another clutch, usually within 22 days, in
one of the chosen brooding nests that the 'alpha' male has built within the
territory.
Mutual preening (allopreening) is often a behaviour associated with birds
that are very bonded, although allopreening has not been a frequently
observed behaviour among our group of crakes. Frequent exchanges of
food between birds, chick brooding and nest sharing (behaviour in which
juveniles and/or adult birds sit side by side in a nest) are the most frequent
means of social contact and bonding-type behaviour that we have observed
among our crakes. Exchanging of food occurs between adult to chick, adult
to juvenile and fledgling, juvenile to juvenile, and juvenile to fledgling. All
mature crakes, juveniles and fledglings have been observed feeding nestlings
from two days of age. Our youngest fledgling recorded as feeding another
group member, nestling or juvenile, was aged 27 days. Thus the period in
development, from fledging (still dependent on its parents) to juvenile must
be a relatively short stage. It is likely that a 7-14 day old chick can feed

itself and begins to feed its younger siblings at around 20-27 days old, but is
certainly not capable of completely fending for itself given that it has yet to
learn all the skills necessary for survival. Juveniles and fledglings have
been observed feeding adults and then adults returning the same morsel to
the same bird, or turning around and feeding it to another group member.
Adult-to-adult feeding (birds over the age of 12 months) has only been
observed when the female is incubating eggs or brooding nestlings; in these
instances it has been the 'alpha' male that has been observed feeding the
'alpha' female. This is not to say that adult birds or juveniles do not feed
each other during other times of the year. Although infrequent, juveniles
from the age of 37 days have been observed feeding, incubating or brooding
nestlings. Many of the group 'helpers' (adults, juveniles and fledglings)
seem to so urgently 'need' to feed another group member that they will feed
any other crake, adult or juvenile, that approaches them or that they walk
upon. The urge to feed newly hatched chicks, and any other crake that
inhabited the immediate crake territory, was most recognizable in the 'alpha'
breeding male. Along with this 'alpha' male, juveniles between the ages of
4-12 weeks of age appear to possess the strongest nestling feeding instincts.
Single nestlings that were the lone survivors of broods were documented as
having a more urgent and earlier feeding instinct than those chicks hatched
among broods with more than one member. The first three crake clutches to
hatch, at DAK, fledged single chicks. Each of these chicks diligently cared
for the four nestlings which hatched in the fourth clutch. When this clutch
of four hatched, the three older juveniles began feeding the brooding female;
she in turn fed the chicks that she was brooding.
The age at which our crake chicks were observed actively foraging and
feeding on their own varied from 7-14 days. The age at which chicks were
observed actively foraging on their own decreased as the number of juveniles
in the cooperative breeding group increased. For example, the first chick tc
hatch in the collection, a single chick which hatched from a clutch of four
eggs, was not observed to feed on its own until it was 23 days old. The
youngest chicks to be observed feeding on their own were those hatched
among a group of four hatchlings; they were seen foraging when seven days
old. The shorter length of time that chicks exhibited foraging and feeding
behaviour may be attributed to the increased number of older juveniles
serving as role models and 'teachers'. At the time this brood of four chicks
hatched, three broods of single crakes had reached independence bringing
the peer group to three adults (the nucleus adult breeding 'alpha' pair and
peripheral male) and three juvenile birds from the first three clutches. Adults,
juveniles, fledglings and nestlings could easily be observed foraging in the
'tidal zone' from the visitor bridge. The crakes at Disney's Animal Kingdom
are identified using colour-coded bands and small cable ties. Tossing

individual birds waxworms allowed us to observe exactly who was fed and
at what age the associative activities that make up the association between
cooperative breeding birds took place. The foraging and feeding habitat the
crakes preferred were the shallow waters in which the rice grass grew, even
nestlings hatched in the upper forested areas of the aviary, or in mid-canopy,
were brought down into the 'tidal zone' (rice grass) areas within three days
of hatching.
Fledgling and juvenile crakes have been observed participating in
incubating eggs only for brief periods. From the age of 37 days, fledglings
and juveniles have also been observed brooding nestlings. Juvenile and
fledgling crakes have been observed brooding younger nestlings more
frequently than they have been observed incubating eggs. The increased
instances of brooding behaviour by juveniles and fledglings is likely to be
due to the nature of the chick. Searching for warmth, the precocial very
mobile chick has the capabilities of approaching another crake, of any age,
and being brooded.
A Change in Territory
The crakes have moved to the tops of three large Queen Palm Trees
making them significantly more difficult to observe. The crakes may have
deserted their rice grass territory because of recent fluctuating water levels,
increased visitor numbers or because of the present decline of the mature
rice grass. Their departure may have also resulted from the interference
they experienced when their latest clutch of eggs was replaced with artificial
eggs in an effort to avoid over-populating our crake habitat. With less human
disturbance and replanting of the dense rice grass 'tidal zone', the crakes
may return to this habitat.
Conclusion
The Black Crake possesses an intriguing and remarkable cooperative
breeding strategy. The Black Crake group at Disney's Animal Kingdom
suggests that the crakes' reproductive success improves if there are more
helpers to take part in the task of raising chicks. The data collected also
demonstrates a substantial change in the age at which fledglings begin to
feed on their own. Chicks that have a greater number of older siblings
begin foraging and feeding on their own at a younger age (seven days of age
as compared to 23 days). A very small association seems to exist between
our mature peripheral male, part of the original nucleus of three adult birds,
and our 'alpha' breeding pair. This male continues to live on the outskirts of
the 'alpha' territory and is not an active member in the cooperative breeding
association. It has not been determined why this male has not become an
inclusive member.

INCA TERNS BREED AGAIN AT THE NATIONAL
ZOOLOGICAL PARK
By Sara Hallager

The Inca Tern Larosterna inca is found in the Humboldt Current
region of South America from northern Peru south to Chile. It is not
considered globally threatened, but populations are vulnerable especially to
weather phenomenon such as El Ninos (del Hoyo et al. 1996). White feathers
on either side of the base of the bill curve back and downwards and yellow
wattles at the comers of the bill contrast strikingly with the slate blue feathers
which cover the body. The Inca Tem is the only species of tem that nests in
deep crevices and caves (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Because of its unique physical
appearance and unusual breeding behaviour, the Inca Tem is placed in its
own monotypic genus, Larosterna.
At the National Zoological Park (NZP) in Washington DC, Inca Terns
are exhibited in a large, free flight aviary from April to November. During
the winter months, they are housed off-exhibit in a heated building.
Measuring 26m tall x 41m wide (85ft tall x 135ft wide), the aviary also

aviary on a central path. The aviary is planted with mature, evergreen and
deciduous trees, small bushes and ground cover. In the centre of the aviary,
there are a series of large, 10m (30ft) high artificial rock cliffs, at the base of
which there are three pools.
History of the flock
Inca Terns formerly bred at the NZP from 1974-1983. During this time,
they were in a smaller aviary. Throughout these years, a total of 22 chicks
were hatched. The parents were rarely successful in rearing their chicks
however, and hand-rearing was a frequent necessity (Tomassoni per. comm.).
From 1983-1991, the number of terns fluctuated between two and 12 birds.
Egg production in the flock continued until 1988, and then ceased. None of
these eggs were fertile. The terns were fed Nebraska brand Bird of Prey
diet.
In 1992, following the introduction of seven captive bom individuals,
12 Inca Terns were moved to the large aviary where the species is housed
today. The diet was changed to Zupreem canned feline diet mixed with

Mazuri(R) Sea duck pellets and Ziegler(R) flamingo fancier pellets. A calcium
supplement was sprinkled on top. This diet was also fed to all of the other
carnivorous birds in the aviary. In 1995, bill abnormalities began developing
in six of the captive hatched terns. The bills became severely overgrown
and began to split lengthwise. A diet too high in protein was thought to be
the problem. A change to an all fish diet was implemented in 1996.
This new diet comprised a variety of fish including Smelt Osmerus
mordex, Butterfish Peprilus triacanthus and Capelin Mallotus villosus fed
twice a day, with Smelt being the predominant fish fed. A powdered
supplement of Vitamin E and thiamin was sprinkled over the fish along
with calcium powder. Over the course of the following year, bi-annual bill
trims eliminated the bill deformities in all but one bird. Hand-feeding the
terns fish allowed them to fill up on fish and not canned cat food, which was
still fed to other species in the exhibit. Beginning in 1996, nest-boxes were
provided, which were square in shape and featured a square shaped entrance
tunnel. Sand was placed inside the boxes. Proof that the terns were
investigating the nest-boxes was evidenced by the displacement of the sand
inside the boxes. Breeding activity was still not observed.
In addition to the new diet described above, goldfish were offered as a
weekly treat starting in 1997. The terns continued to investigate the nest-
boxes, but the 1997 breeding season did not result in any eggs being laid.
The 1998 breeding season
At the onset of the 1998 breeding season, the flock consisted of one pair
of wild caught birds (estimated to be about 16 years old) and eight captive
hatched birds, ranging in age from three to seven years. For the 1998
breeding season, three new nest-boxes were made available to the terns.
Constructed of wood, the new boxes were triangular in shape. The bottom
of the nest-boxes was also wood and a layer of sand was added inside as a
nesting substrate. The face of the nest-boxes were blocked off, except for a
4in (10.2cm) hole in which a piece of PVC piping of the same dimension
fitted snugly inside. Small holes drilled at the top of the nest-boxes allowed
for some ventilation (See diagram). The nest-boxes were placed in locations
around the artificial rock cliffs.
The terns began investigating the new nest-boxes immediately. Two
weeks after placement of the new boxes, the first eggs were laid. Several
days later, a second pair of terns produced eggs. To minimize disturbance,
the nest-boxes were not checked until the end of the incubation period. After
26 days of incubation, both nest-boxes were inspected and each was found
to contain two chicks. A third pair of terns hatched one chick several weeks
later (their second egg did not hatch). Following the arrival of the chicks,
all fish presented to the terns was chopped into small pieces for the parents

to offer the chicks and was provided three times a day. When the chicks
were several weeks old, they began to leave the nest-box and investigate the
area immediately around their nest-box. At the first sign of danger however,
they quickly retreated into their nest-box. Actual flight was not observed
until the chicks were 40-45 days old.
Design of nest-box in which the terns nested successfully
Although the three sets of parents of the five chicks were still on occasion
feeding their now fledged offspring, two of the three pairs each produced a
second clutch of eggs. Again, following a 25-day incubation period, two
chicks hatched in one nest-box. The second pair of terns hatched one chick,
but it was found dead the following day. The other egg in this pair's clutch
pipped but failed to hatch successfully (See Table 1).
Approximately one week prior to the hatching of one pair's second
clutch of eggs, an unfortunate event occurred with this same pair's first two
offspring. Over the course of one week, the two juvenile terns (three months
old) both died from aspergillosis and malaria.

Several events combined to make the 1998 Inca Tern breeding season at
the National Zoo a successful one. The first was the change in diet from
meat to fish. Throughout the 1998 breeding season, paired terns were often
seen using fish as a part of their courtship feeding. Courtship feeding has
been documented in the wild in this species, and is an important part of the
entire breeding cycle (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The second event contributing
to the breeding success, was the new nest-boxes. In the wild, Inca Terns
nest in small crevices and caves in high cliffs (del Hoyo et al. 1996). By
simulating the nesting situation in the wild through the use of a length of
tubing leading into a cave-like area, the terns found the security they needed
to nest and rear their young.
Although four of the nine chicks died, the breeding season was still a
successful one. After 15 years, Inca Terns are again breeding at the National
Zoo.

THE PURPLE-BELLIED PARROT Triclaria malachitacea :
ITS BIOLOGY AND HUSBANDRY

The Purple-bellied Parrot Triclaria malachitacea is endemic to south-east
Brazil, where the wild population is in decline. It is not very well known in
captivity, in which it has a high mortality and a low reproductive rate. At the
beginning of 1998, the Loro Parque Foundation, Tenerife, Canary Islands,
Spain, possessed the largest collection with 21 (9.10.2) of the approximately
60 individuals in captivity outside of Brazil.
My study of this species began in October 1996 and its objectives were:
To compile the existing information on its biology and general situation
in the wild.
To compile the information on its husbandry in captivity, both from the
existing literature and from experience gained through keeping this species
at the Loro Parque Foundation.

Distribution
Brazil: This species is endemic to the Atlantic forest of south-east Brazil,
from south-east Bahia State south to northern Rio Grande do Sul (Arndt,
1996; Bertagnolio, 1981; Collar et al. 1992; Forshaw and Cooper, 1989; de
Grahl, 1986; Low, 1994a; Ridgely, 1981; Robiller, 1990 and Sick, 1993). It
has been found in the states of Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio
Grande do Sul (Collar et al. 1992). One record for Campo Grande (Sick,
1985) has been discarded by Straube and Scherer-Neto (1995) and by Collar
etal. (1992).

Argentina: Two records exist: Canevari et al. (1991) identified this species
in November 1986 in Provincial Urugua-i Park and Rumboll (1990) identified
it in April 1983 in the National Park of Iguazu. This author justifies these
movements outside the usual area of distribution, as being a search for new
habitat, due to the progressive destruction of its original habitat.
Habitat
It occurs on the escarpment and in humid forest as well as in the altiplanos
within its range of distribution (Arndt, 1996; Belton, 1984; Forshaw and
Cooper, 1989; Ridgely, 1981; Robiller, 1990), while Sick (1993) stated that
it occurs in xerophytic woodland.
In the breeding season it is found at altitudes of 300m- 1,000m (approx.
980ft-3,280ft) (Arndt, 1996; Collar et al. 1992; Forshaw and Cooper, 1989;
Robiller, 1988, 1990). Outside the breeding season they group to carry out
displacements towards the lowlands of the coast (Collar et al. 1992; Forshaw
and Cooper, 1989; Sick; 1968, 1993), as do Pileated Parrakeets Pionopsitta
pileata (Bertagnolio, 1975, 1981; Straube and Scherer-Neto, 1995). Sick
(1993) confirmed that they visit the town of Parati, Rio de Janeiro.
According to Yamashita in Collar et al. (1992) it occurs in habitat rich in
bromeliace forests along watercourses in valleys. In the states of Parana
and Sao Paulo, according to Straube and Scherer-Neto (1995), it is restricted
to dense Ambriphils forests. According to Bencke (1996) in Rio Grande do
Sul it inhabits patches of broadleaf forest and pine groves of mainly Araucaria
angustifolia.

<bodyText confidence="0.98519356097561" page_id="56237774"  page_num="28" year="" vol="">
There is evidence that during the course of the year they carry out short
displacements to forests and gardens around cities (Bertagnolio, 1981;
Forshaw and Cooper, 1989; Ridgely, 1981; Sick, 1968; Straube and Scherer-
Neto, 1995) and to com fields (Bencke, 1996).
Yamashita (in Collar et al. 1992) and Sick (1968) stated that they are
found in the canopy of high trees. Collar et al. (1992) stated that in the
Biological Reserve Augusto Ruschi they occur from mid-stratum almost to
the canopy. In Rio Grande do Sul, according to Bencke (1996), they occupy
the lower stratum of the forest between 5m (approx. 16ft) and 10m (approx.
32ft) up from the forest floor.
Population
Even though it is a protected species under Brazilian law (Straube and
Scherer-Neto, 1995), according to Forshaw and Cooper (1989) and Ridgely
(1981), although it is still common in some districts, Triclaria malachitacea
has disappeared from most of its old range. Low (1994b) considers it to be
vulnerable. Robiller (1990) considers that the population is declining but is
not in danger. Lambert et al. (1993) estimated the total population to be
fewer than 5,000 individuals and it is considered an endangered species by
the IUCN (Collar et al. 1994).
In Rio Grande do Sul, according to Belton (1984), it is a scarce resident.
Bencke (1996) considers it to be quite common in wide regions of mature
forest and in a 45sq km (approx. 17sq miles) area that embraces the east-
central part of the state, estimated a maximum of 10,000 individuals. Aleixo
and Galetti (1997) consider it to be fairly common in the Estadual Intervales
Park (Sao Paulo State). Straube and Scherer-Neto (1995) regard it as an
unusual species in the states of Sao Paulo and Parana.
Collar et al. (1992) say that its density has been underestimated due to
its shyness, but according to Bencke (1996) and Straube and Scherer-Neto
(1995) its habit of forming into small groups and its peculiar song make it a
conspicuous species. Because of the resemblance of the female to that of
Pionopsitta pileata and the overlapping of the two species' ranges
(Bertagnolio, 1975, 1981; Forshaw and Cooper, 1989; Low, 1994a),
confusion has probably arisen in some cases. All this seems to indicate that
it is not a very abundant species.
Vocalisation
Its very characteristic voice, melodious and difficult to describe, is unlike
that of any other parrot. It vocalizes both in flight and at rest (Belton, 1984;
Straube and Scherer-Neto, 1995). Males sing more frequently and more
strongly. Females can also sing. Rossi dalla Riva captured an individual
with a different song. It was described as 'tone deaf' (Bertagnolio, 1981).
My study of eight captive pairs found no very significant differences between

Several authors describe its flight as quick, slight and precise (Belton,
1984; Forshaw and Cooper, 1989). Murray (1969) described having seen
those in his aviary fly like a shrike with long glides with only the tips of the
wings moving, and catch flies on the wing with the same circular flight as
that of the Spotted Flycatcher Muscicapa striata. I found in captivity each
individual carries out an average of five flights an hour, except during the
early hours of the day when a larger number of flights take place (Cornejo
in preparation). In Robiller (1988, 1990) Burkard affirmed that in captivity
they spend most of the time flying, settling only occasionally. Evidently
this behaviour is influenced by their housing conditions and surroundings.

They are most active at dawn and late in the afternoon (Yamashita in
Collar et al. 1992). As is characteristic of species of humid forests they are
inactive during most of the day. I found that in captivity they pass 75% of
the day resting or sleeping. The greatest activity takes place during the first
and last hours of the day (Cornejo in preparation).

Food and Feeding
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998194631578947" page_id="56237775"  page_num="29" year="" vol="">
According to Bertagnolio (1981), Collar et al. (1992), Forshaw and
Cooper (1989) and Sick (1968) their natural diet is based on seeds and the
pulp of different forest trees, as well as nectar and invertebrates. In Rio
Grande do Sul, according to Bencke (1996), the last two foods are eaten less
frequently, instead they eat mostly vegetable matter, mainly the seeds of
Pachystroma longifolium, Actinostemon concolor, various fruits of the family
Myrtaceae and sometimes Com Zea mays growing in fields adjacent to
patches of forest. Pizo et al. (1995) agree as to the importance of Myrtaceae
fruits but not the importance in the area of Euterpes adulis (Palmito), which
was considered by Bertagnolio (1981) and Collar et al. (1992) to be their
principal source of food. Belton (1984) stated that they eat the pine kernels
of Araucaria angustifolia. Citric fruits also form part of their diet and
Allmenroeder in Keller (1990), Carvalho in Collar et al. (1992), Forshaw
and Cooper (1989) and Sick (1968) agree that they like Lemons Citrus
medica, of which they eat only the seeds. Pizo et al. (1995), state that they
eat oranges. Bencke (1996), Bertagnolio (1981), Collar et al. (1992), Low
(1972) and Murray (1969) state that they like to eat tree bark. Murray (1972)
was of the opinion that their natural diet also includes leaves and Low (1972)
reported that in captivity they have been seen eating leaves.

Yamashita in Collar et al. (1992) stated that they move at the level of the
tree canopy or even above it. Bencke (1996) said they will cross small clear
areas contra Collar et al. (1992). Bertagnolio (1981) and Yamashita in Collar
et al. (1992) affirm that they usually go about in small groups and according
to Robiller (1988,1990) these are especially frequent outside of the breeding
season. However, almost 50 of the 106 records registered by Bencke (1996)
were of pairs. According to Pizo et al. (1995) they live in pairs or small
groups of up to four individuals.
Territory
Collar et al. (1992) and Straube and Scherer Neto (1995) confirmed their
strong territorial instinct by getting aggressive reactions from playing
recordings. Arndt (1996), Flicker (1990), Murray (1969) and Robiller (1988,
1990) found that the same strong territorial instinct exists in captive paired
birds.
Reproduction
In the wild they nest from September to January (Bencke, 1996;
Bertagnolio, 1981; de Grahl, 1986), or earlier (Arndt, 1996; Camargo, 1976;
Forshaw and Cooper, 1989). They use natural holes in trees in which to
nest (Arndt, 1996; Bencke, 1996; Bertagnolio, 1981; Camargo, 1976; de
Grahl, 1986) including, according to Bertagnolio (1981) and de Grahl (1986),
holes in palm trees.

According to de Grahl (1986), the first news of this bird dates back to
1820, when Principe Max described it, soon after an explorer named Nattere
bought one in a market on the 'River of Janeiro'. The Austrian Emperor
had two between 1822 and 1825 and, in 1878, a merchant named Hamburgo
Lintz offered a couple to Dr. Rua. In 1879, Messrs. Hagenbeck had one in
Berlin, when the famous collection at London Zoo still did not have one.
There seems not to have been any further news of any captive individuals
until 1905, when one appeared in England. The first one arrived at Berlin
Zoo in 1910 (Robiller, 1988, 1990). Nothing further seems to have been
written about this species until two arrived in England in 1960. In 1964, the
late Herbert Murray imported two pairs from Brazil and in 1968 almost
achieved what would have been the first recorded successful breeding of
this species in captivity, had not the youngster died in the nest. Then in
1971 Rossi dalla Riva hatched one youngster (the other egg contained a
dead embryo).
At the end of 1997 the captive population outside of Brazil was restricted
to pairs belonging to private collections in Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Spain,
Portugal and the USA, plus those at Vogelpark Walsrode, Germany, Palmitos
Park and the Loro Parque Foundation, Canary Islands, Spain, totalling
altogether approximately 60 individuals.
The one that has lived the longest in captivity could be a male that arrived
in January 1986 at Loro Parque, and at the beginning of 1998 was at least 13
years old.
Housing
Experience demonstrates that this is a delicate and difficult species to
establish in captivity (Arndt, 1996; Bertagnolio, 1981; Fricker and Fricker,
1992; Gismondi, 1990; Krenek, 1994; Low, 1988, 1994a; Murray, 1969;
Patzwahl, 1993; Robiller, 1988, 1990). Imported birds require time to
become acclimatized, but once this has been overcome, become stupendous
aviary birds.
In large aviaries they are able to demonstrate the beauty of their flight.
The smallest aviary in which reproductive successes have been documented
was 3m x lm x lm (approx. 9ft 9in x 3ft 3in x 3ft 3in), suspended 1.5m
(approx. 5ft) above the ground, at the Loro Parque breeding facility. Bigger
aviaries are, of course, preferable. They are said to like green-walled shelters
(Bertagnolio, 1981; Low, 1994a). According to Arndt (1996) they should
be housed in pairs in separate but continuous aviaries. Krenek (1994) housed
two females with each male but only the dominant female of each trio bred,
thereby demonstrating the monogamous tendencies of Triclaria.

Silva (1991) stated that they do not tolerate well temperatures higher
than 37.5*C (99.5*F). Arndt (1996) and Collar et al. (1992) consider the
minimum temperature for them is 20*C (68*F). However, Flicker and Fricker
(1992) and Low (1994a) affirm that they are not delicate in low temperatures.
If they have a nest-box which they like, they will roost in it at night (Arndt,
1996; Bertagnolio, 1981; Fricker, 1990; Fricker and Fricker 1992), although
this behaviour is not always observed (Silva, 1991).
According to Wasilewski (per. comm.) they have a propensity to suffer
from infestations of roundworms, so preventative measures must be taken
in the design of their housing, the provision of prophylactics and other
veterinary measures.
Diet
The basic diet provided for them at Loro Parque is the same as that
provided for most of the other parrots in the collection. The food is prepared
daily in the approximate proportions listed in the Appendix (p. 37). They
are fed twice daily: the first feed is given at 8.30am and includes a dish (Dl)
containing fruits and vegetables (Group 1) mixed with small seeds (Group
2). A second dish (D2) contains two types of pellets (Group 3). At the
second feed, at 2.30pm, the first dish (Dl) is replaced by another dish (D3)
containing legumes and large seeds (Group 5), together with small seeds
(Group 4). Calcium and vitamin/mineral supplements are added to Group
4. This routine is designed to induce the birds to eat more vegetables and
fruits than they would eat if these were served together with the seeds and
legumes. The birds are hungrier in the morning and more eager to eat
whatever is served up for them. Twice daily feeding also mimics the foraging
habits of the birds in the wild because since not all their food is served up at
once, they are able to choose new food items throughout the day (Lafeber,
1991; Harrison, 1986; Reese, 1991). In the breeding season, the basic diet
is enriched with a homemade cake, the ingredients and preparation of which
are detailed in the Appendix.
At Loro Parque each pair receives 155g of food each day, of which each
individual, consumes about 12g fruit and vegetables, 14g seeds and pulses,
1.2g pellets, with everything accompanied by 6ml water. Of the various
items in the diet, they have a preference for pear, apple, guava and pepper,
as well as the corn and sunflower seed (Cornejo and Wolf in preparation).
Each pair has its water changed twice daily. A calcium block made at
Loro Parque (See Appendix) is available at all times. As well as providing
the birds with calcium, it is abrasive and helps them keep their beaks in
good condition.
The calcium supplement used is Calcic Carbonate Carmisur, S.L., the
vitamin/mineral supplement is Pet Chef Professional Breeder Supplement,

the pellet is the Pretty Bird Hi-Energy Special and the commercial mixture
of small seeds is marketed by Wilde Zaden of Dufky.
In 1993 the diet also included boiled chicken once a week and,
occasionally, mealworms Tenebrio molitor (Patzwahl, 1993). During the
time that this diet was used the breeding results were remarkably good, with
three pairs raising a total of nine young.
Reproduction
The following authors have documented the breeding of this species in
captivity: Bertagnolio (1981), Fricker (1990), Fricker and Fricker (1992),
Krenek (1954), Low (1988 and 1994a), Murray (1969), Patzwahl (1993),
Robiller (1988 and 1990) and Silva (1991).
Display and mating
The breeding season at Loro Parque starts at the beginning of the winter.
The first signs of reproductive behaviour are usually the increased activity
and aggressiveness of the males.
Males can begin to display from the age of one year old. At Loro Parque
the youngest breeding pair were a two year eleven month male and a two
year nine month old female.
During the display the male walks along the perch with his body inclined
or held erect, raising the feathers of his head and mantle and spreading the
tail. He shakes his head rapidly and vocalizes and at the same time dilates
the pupils of the eyes, producing a very attractive effect. According to Low
(1994a) and Robiller (1988, 1990) the females also sing and shake their
heads. The dilation of the pupils is common in other Neotropical parrots,
such as those of the genus Amazona and also in species of the mainly Asian
genus Psittacula.
Consistent with a chick requesting food, the male also leans forward
until touching the perch and sings strongly while shaking the wings lightly,
in response to which the female regurgitates food and gives it to him. In
other species of Neotropical parrots, such as the Amazons, it is exclusively
the male that regurgitates food and only the female that solicits it. With
Triclaria I found that both sexes indulge in this behaviour with the same
frequency (Cornejo in preparation).
Bertagnolio (1981) and Silva (1991) observed the male mating with
one foot on the perch and the other on the female's back.
Nest
The few documented breeding successes in captivity have taken place
in vertical wooden nest-boxes. These have varied in size from 20cm-30cm
x 20cm-30cm x 40cm-60cm high (approx. 8in- 1ft x 8in-lft x 1ft 4in-2ft high).

At Loro Parque breeding successes have been achieved using vertical wooden
boxes and boxes fixed at an angle of 45 degrees, both with an entrance hole
between 7.5cm and 10cm (approx. Sin-din) in diameter and with 15cm
(approx. 6in) of sawdust in the bottom of the box. Krenek (1994) obtained
good results using wooden lined metal boxes.

<bodyText confidence="0.986610264705882" page_id="56237780"  page_num="34" year="" vol="">
In captivity in the Canary Islands and England they nest during January
to May. The female spends some time in the nest-box before laying
(Bertagnolio, 1981 and Silva, 1991). She lays on alternative days and the
normal clutch consists of four eggs, although smaller clutches are not unusual
The biggest documented clutches are of seven and eight eggs and were
obtained by Krenek (1994), who removed the eggs as the female laid them.
They lay one clutch a year, but according to Silva (1991), if the first clutch
is lost or removed, they lay again one month later but if the same thing
happens again, will not lay for a third time.
The eggs normally measure 31.5mm x 24.5mm (Bertagnolio, 1981;
Krenek, 1994; Nichols in Forshaw and Cooper, 1989; Robiller, 1988,1990).
The smallest eggs do not usually hatch (Low, 1988, 1994a). According to
Robiller (1988, 1990) a fertile egg weighs 10.2g on the day it is laid.
Incubation
The females are usually tight sitters (Murray, 1969; Silva, 1991).
According to Bencke (1996), Low (1994a), Patzwahl (1993), Robiller (1998,
1990), Silva (1991), Sweeney (per. comm.) and Vr iends (per. comm.) the
average incubation period is 28 days. Incubation begins with the laying of
the first egg (Silva, 1991).
The males feed the females during incubation (Bencke, 1996;
Bertagnolio, 1981; Murray, 1969; Patzwahl, 1993) and occasionally continue
doing so until the chicks are one month old (Silva, 1991). Krenek (1994)
artificially incubated 10 eggs at 37.3*C (99*F) and 50% humidity, and seven
hatched successfully.
Chicks
Newly hatched chicks weigh 7+/-lg (Low, 1994a) and have long, white
down on the wings, back and underparts (Bertagnolio, 1981 and Silva, 1991).
The ears and eyes are closed (Low per. comm, and Silva, 1991) contra
Bertagnolio (1981). The claws are grey (Silva, 1991). According to Low
(per. comm.) and Krenek (1994) the eyes begin to open about the 19th or
20th day and the ears a few days before this. The second down is light grey
and appears about the 14th day. The pin feathers appear during the fourth
week (Krenek, 1994).
The chicks remain in the nest for between seven and eight weeks (Arndt,

Riva in Bertagnolio (1981) affirmed that during the last few days the chicks
are in the nest, it is the male that is in charge of their feeding. According to
Silva (1991) and Patzwahl (1993) the chicks continue to be fed by their
parents for four or five weeks. Bertagnolio (1981) and Low (1994a) agree
that the chicks closely resemble those of the Pileated Parrot Pionopsitta
pileata, while to Silva (1991) they are reminiscent of those of the genus
Pionus.
Triclaria chicks have been hand-reared in several collections. Low (1988)
used Nestle cereals for babies, germinated wheat, de-husked sunflower seeds,
papaya or apple, and carrot, to which were added calcium and vitamins. A
female raised at Loro Parque was tame enough after six years to respond to
whistles, eat from the hand and allow its head to be caressed, contra Murray
(1969) who stated that this species is independent in character and indifferent
to humans, and Low (1988,1994a) who affirmed that hand-reared individuals
show indifference to the person who takes care of them.

The captive breeding of Triclaria malachitacea must be planned so as to
avoid endogamia (inbreeding), otherwise there will be a reduction in fertility
and in the survival rate of the offspring, and an increase in susceptibility to
illness. It is important that pairs are formed using individuals selected from
widest possible gene pool. A centralised studbook must be created and
exchanges between collections controlled by a studbook coordinator. The
genetic lines of each individual should be determined using DNA analysis.
Demography
To increase the size of the captive population is fundamental to assure
the continuity of the population without the necessity to capture further birds
from the wild. It is also an important security measure should possible
mutations, epidemics or other disasters put the captive population in danger.
Conservation
In Situ
According to Bertagnolio (1981) and Collar et al. (1992) the decline of
this species has been brought about by hunting, land clearance for farming
and the intensive collection of Euterpe edulis (Palmito), which some consider
to be its main food plant. (According to Bertagnolio (1981) the Purple-
bellied Parrot is particularly fond of the small fruits of the 'Palmito', a type

of palm growing in dense forest. The fibrous pith of this palm yields a
starchy substance used mainly as a thickening agent in soups and puddings,
and is extensively collected by cutting down the mature trees.)Bencke (1996)
considers that in Rio Grande do Sul the cutting of wood for the curing of
tobacco is the main threat and not the gathering of Palmito. According to
Rumboll (1990), on Sao Paulo's south coast 85% of its habitat has been cut
down. Straube and Scherer-Neto (1995) also cite this as the main cause of
its decline in this area.
Studies indicate that the population is also decreasing because of
increasing human activity and survives only in the most inaccessible areas
and those for which humans have no use. This supposes their exclusion to
isolated areas of forest where the opportunities for survival are not so great.
According to Bencke (1996) one of the measures required is to create
protected forest corridors linking these 'islands'.
According to Bencke (1996), the capture of individuals for the bird market
is not significant in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, but according to Straube
and Scherer-Neto (1995) it is significant on Sao Paulo's south coast. The
commercial exploitation of wild individuals must be avoided because of the
risk this poses to the wild population. A complete census of the wild
population is recommended, along with a more complete study of its biology.
This will determine with greater precision the population's status and the
appropriate measures necessary for the protection of this species.

To assure the survival of this species in captivity by achieving self-
sustaining populations, collections in possession of this species must
undertake responsible planning for its breeding. It will also be necessary to
take into account the possibility of the need for captive bred birds to be
released into the wild, therefore hand-rearing should be undertaken only
when absolutely necessary. The results of investigations in to the biology
of this species must be made widely available so that the best use can be
made of the information.
Conclusion
As is shown in this work, there is still much to be learnt about the biology
of this species. Larger and more complete studies need to be carried out to
accurately determine the situation regarding Triclaria malachitacea in its
natural habitat and to determine what conservation measures are required.
In aviculture, although it has been known for many years, it continues to
be a difficult species to maintain and persuade to breed. A combined effort
by the collections that possess this species, which includes an international
breeding programme, would be an important step forward in obtaining better
breeding results and thereby increasing the captive population.

THE SOCIETY'S VISITS TO LEEDS CASTLE
AND PAULTONS PARK
by Stewart Pyper

Leeds Castle, of which the bird collection is just one part, is probably
the largest tourist attraction in Kent. During the 1960s and 1970s until her
death, Lady Baillie maintained a varied collection there with the nucleus
consisting of Australian parrakeets, which at the time were eagerly sought
after by breeders both here and on the continent. Reports of her breedings
were a regular feature in News &amp; Views.
The Society first visited the bird collection in 1988, the year after the
new aviaries were opened by H.R.H. Princess Alexandra. On Saturday,
September 19th 1998, the Society made a return visit on what turned out to
be a glorious and highly successful late summer day. Laura Gardner, the
Curator, helped with the arrangements and together with her staff gave us a
conducted and highly informative tour of the bird collection. Those present
had a most enjoyable day spent in delightful surroundings.
Generally constructed from stainless steel, several of the aviaries have
pointed roofs not unlike those of Kentish oast houses (used to dry the hops
used in brewing beer) and these are used by the birds to shelter from the
elements, although in all aviaries the birds have access to indoor shelters.
All aviaries with the exception of those housing parrots are well planted and
in some cases this led to difficulty viewing the occupants, but I understand
that a certain amount of pruning was planned. However, the planting does
provide excellent cover for nesting birds.
Those bred during 1998 included Red-billed Blue Magpies, Yellow-
throated Laughing Thrushes, Kookaburras, Crowned Hornbills and second
generation Von der Decken's Hornbills. It was the second year that Crowned
Hornbills have been bred there. The first breeding you may recall was the
subject of an illustrated report early in 1998 (.Avicultural Magazine, 104,
2:61-64).
We saw Emerald and Royal or Golden-breasted Starlings, Roulroul
Partridges and various touracos including the Purple-crested and Red-crested
species. To try to stimulate the Toco Toucans to breed cork is fixed over the
nest-box entrance hole and the birds have to chip this away as if they are
excavating a nest hole in a tree in the wild. Because both Blue-bellied
Rollers are believed to be females, they had been separated. We also saw a
partly grown Crowned Crane with its parents and Demoiselle Cranes in an
open paddock with a water feature housing Koi carp and Hooded Mergansers.
The varied selection of parrots range from Goldie's Lorikeets to Splendid
Grass Parrakeets, Roseate and Blue-eyed Cockatoos, Australian King

Parrakeets, Green-winged and Scarlet Macaws and Tucuman Amazons. We
were shown where the food is prepared off-exhibit and in the rearing room
saw three Tucuman Amazons only two to three weeks old, seven Red-fronted
Kakarikis, two Royal or Golden-breasted Starlings, two Red-crested Touracos
and two melanistic Stella's Lories. The last four were housed in small,
suspended flights, which make cleaning so much easier. A great variety of
commercially produced livefood is available to help with successful rearing.
It was pleasing to see displayed on an information board the Avicultural
Society first breeding certificates awarded to the Leeds Castle collection for
the first breeding of Fischer's Touraco and Von der Decken's Hombill. The
certificate for the first breeding of the Crowned Hombill can now be added
to the earlier two. It is excellent publicity for the Society.
Earlier in the year the Society visited Paultons Park, Ower, Romsey,
Hampshire. Arrangements for the visit were handled by Geoff Massom, the
General Manager, who is a member of our Society. Many of us had not
visited the park before and we were all impressed by the excellent aviaries,
their occupants and the general lay-out of the collection, with plenty of room
still for expansion.
There is a wide selection of birds housed in aviaries which vary in size
according to the requirements of the occupants. The aviaries are mainly in
blocks spread around the grounds. There is a varied selection of hombills
including Rhinoceros, Wrinkled, Trumpeter and Von der Decken's. The
successful partial hand-rearing of a Wrinkled Hombill at Paultons Park was
the subject of an article in the Avicultural Magazine (103,4:163-169). Toco
and Sulphur-breasted Toucans are housed in the flights adjoining those of
the hombills. Separate aviaries house Kookaburras, White-cheeked and
Violaceous Touracos. There are selections of seedeaters from the continents
of Australia, Asia and Africa in three glass-fronted flights.
Violet-backed and Emerald Starlings, Roulroul Partridges and Zosterops
were among the birds on view in the small tropical house. The park has a
varied selection of parrots including a prolific pair of Green-winged Macaws.
A selection of pheasants and guans share their flights with various doves,
thrushes, bulbuls and starlings. A pair of Red-legged Serierna in an enclosure
close to some houses were proving to be very vocal, especially early in the
mornings.

Although the emphasis in the first section of the International Zoo
Yearbook , Volume 36, is concerned with various aspects of the management
of Old World primates, there is much within its 663 pages of interest to those
who keep or work with birds. Major articles include Hand-rearing the Eastern
or Great White Pelican (Vogelpark Avifauna), Breeding and rearing the Oriental
White Stork (Shanghai Zoological Gardens), Individual variation in food
consumption and food preferences in St Lucia Parrots (Jersey Wildlife
Preservation Trust) and Breeding the Red and Blue Lory (Loro Parque).
There is also a comprehensive reference section which, with a few
exceptions such as China, provides concise but informative details of the
world's zoological collections and aquariums. A valuable census of rare
animals in captivity covers, in this volume, the years 1996-1997. As Malcolm
Ellis, Editor of the Avicultural Magazine remarked in a recent conversation:
'If it was not for the International Zoo Yearbook we wouldn't know half of
what is being kept and bred in collections around the world'. Many species
take the eye in this particular section, including Madagascar Teal (Jersey,
Channel Islands), Hoatzin (New York, USA), White-necked Picathartes (San
Antonio, USA), Grey-necked Picathartes (Frankfurt, Germany) and Brown
Sicklebill (New York, USA).
The list of birds bred in collections makes encouraging reading for the
many people who believe that captive breeding programmes make a
meaningful contribution to the conservation of an increasing number of
species. It is interesting to see a growing number of 'difficult' species
breeding successfully. Almost inevitably my eyes strayed to some of the
smaller species - and not just Passerines for there have been some significant
achievements among other Orders, which will add to existing knowledge of
the species concerned. Among them are Elf Owl (Tulsa, USA), White-
tailed Trogon (Walsrode, Germany) and Crimson-breasted Barbet (San
</bodyText>
<reference confidence="0.7267973">
Diego, USA). Prominent among the Passerines are Spangled Cotinga, Bare-
throated Bellbird, Vermilion Flycatcher and Barn Swallow (Wuppertal,
Germany), Brown-throated Wattle-Eye (Arnhem, Netherlands) and Red-
billed Oxpecker (Dresden, Germany). Six species of birds of paradise, 21
tanagers, 11 barbets and nine toucans are also listed from other collections.
The International Zoo Yearbook is edited by P.S.J. Olney and Fiona A.
Fisken, while Linda J. Davolls is Assistant Editor. It is published by the
Zoological Society of London, Regent's Park, London, NWI4RY. Volume
36 costs #65.00 (plus postage and packing).

STORMY END TO POSSIBLE FIRST BREEDINGS

<bodyText confidence="0.983240166666667" page_id="56237789"  page_num="43" year="" vol="">
Torrential rain and gale force winds in the coastal province of KwaZulu-
Natal, South Africa, put an end to the possible first aviary breedings there of
Vieillot's Black Weaver Ploceus nigerrimus and a race of the Village or
Black-headed Weaver/ 5 , cucullatus paroptus. According to Neville Brickell
of the Avicultural Research Unit, the birds belonging to Trevor Konigkramer
are housed in an aviary 10.5m long x 5m wide x 3m high (approx. 34ft 3in
long x 16ft 3in wide x 9ft 5in high). The first nest was attached to a dry
branch and contained three pale bluish white eggs with large brown spots at
the broad end. One of the eggs was measured and found to be 20mm x
14mm. The nest of P. c. paroptus was attached to the wire mesh of the
aviary roof and also contained three eggs. These were greenish blue and
one of them measured 24mm x 17mm.

According to a report in The Times newspaper, the British Foreign Office
is to spend #15,000 (approx. US$24,000) from its environment fund on a
conservation project aimed at boosting the number of Black Parrots
Coracopsis nigra barklyi on the island of Praslin, in the Seychelles. This
race is confined to Praslin Island on which only about 200 are thought to
survive. The money will be used to provide 60 nest-boxes, supported on
tall platforms and mounted on metal poles. The boxes will be screened with
palm leaves and have, according to the report, the desired drop from the
hole down to the nesting chamber, similar to that of its natural nest site in
the hollow trunks of Coco de Mer or Latanier Palms.

The UK Environment Minister, Michael Meacher, has given the go ahead
for thousands of Ruddy Duck Oxyura jamaicensis to be shot during the next
three years as part of a trail project to assess whether this species can be
eradicted from the British Isles. Many groups and individuals, including I
know, our member Derek Goodwin, are strongly opposed to the cull, but the
RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) believes it is necessary to
try to help save the rare White-headed Duck O. leucocephala with which, in
Spain, the male Ruddy Duck hybridizes so readily. The first Ruddy Ducks
escaped in the early 1950s from what was then called the Wildfowl Trust, at
Slimbridge, Glos., and the species has bred very successfully in Britain and
has now spread to some 20 other countries, including, Spain.

John Harvey, of Devizes, Wiltshire, reports that during 1998 he succeeded
in breeding five Indian Silverbills Lonchura malabarica, a Blue-breasted
Waxbill Uraeginthus angolensis and three Red-faced Pytilias Pytilia
hypogrammica. The silverbills used a traditional nest basket in which they
raised broods of two and three young. The Blue-breasted Waxbills had
numerous nests in which the young died within the first 12 days and
succeeded in raising only one youngster to independence. The pair of Red-
faced Pytilias consisted of a male which John bred in 1997 and a female he
purchased in September of the same year. Altogether they had three nests,
all with fertile eggs, but only one nest of three eggs all hatched and all three
young survived. This was in July during one of the warmer periods of the
summer. They were fed the usual seed mixture given to such birds, plus
mini mealworms and were provided with a fruit fly culture and could also
catch livefood in the outside flight. John was unable to obtain ants' eggs
last year, which he believes are a valuable form of livefood when Estrildids
are rearing young.

EXOTIC ESCAPEES

According to an account in Winging It , Newsletter of the American
Birding Association, Inc., Vol.10, No.ll, 177 species of exotic birds have
been reported in Florida, probably more than in any other state in the USA.
One of the latest is the Purple Gallinule (or Swamphen) Porphyrio porphyrio.
Eighty-four have been counted 15 miles (approx. 24km) south-west of Fort
Lauderdale. They appear to be of the pale-headed race P. porphyrio
poliocephalus and are breeding there. They are thought to originate from
Miami MetroZoo's Wings of Asia exhibit, from which some escaped in
1992 when their aviary was destroyed by Hurricane Andrew.

A Lesser Flamingo Phoeniconaias minor has been bred at Hillside Bird
Oasis at Mobberley, Cheshire, which is co-owned by Diana Holloway
(recently elected an Avicultural Society Council Member) and Mark Rubery,
who also own Blackbrook Zoological Park. The egg hatched after 28 days
and the chick was brooded for the first three days by the female with the
male often in close attendance. At five days old the chick was mobile and
easily able to climb back on to the nest mound. It is the fourth kind of

UTTERLY DISGUSTED

One of a group of American tourists visiting St James's Park in London,
was said to have been 'utterly disgusted' by the sight of a pelican catching
and eating a Moorhen Gallinula chloropus. The offender was one of two
American White Pelicans Pelecanus erythrorhynchos and two of the African
species P. onocrotalus living on the lake in the park. Pelicans are said to
have first been kept in St James's Park in the 1660s, when the Russian
Ambassador presented a pair to Charles II. At least 40 pelicans have been
kept in the park this century.

VETS IN THE JUNGLE

<bodyText confidence="0.9647744" page_id="56237792"  page_num="46" year="" vol="">
The Caribbean Veterinary Medical Association recently held its 21st
Biennial Congress in Guyana, South America. The papers included one on
the spread of ticks by birds and specifically whether Cattle Egrets Bubulcus
ibis can be hosts to immature stages of Amblyomma and might carry these
as far as southern Florida, USA.
At the conclusion of the congress some of the delegates, including
Margaret and John Cooper from the UK, spent two days at the Shanklands
rainforest resort on the edge of the Essequibo River. They found it a tranquil
and picturesque spot with ready access to the 'jungle' and where one can
readily appreciate tropical biodiversity. Margaret and John saw and heard
many species of birds including toucans, macaws and vultures. They were
astonished that birds as large and brightly coloured as macaws remain so
well hidden that they at first needed a guide to point them out. Only the
sound of falling fruits and a faint red haze in the canopy gave away their
presence. Margaret and John also saw plenty of guans skulking in the
undergrowth. Both the open, grassed areas and the forest abound with insect
life, especially butterflies such as the vividly coloured heliconids that are so
popular in walk-through insect houses in European zoos and the
breathtakingly beautiful Morpho species, with iridescent blue wings. Anole
lizards clamber among the bushes and large tegus run through the grass.
Mammals were elusive and not easily seen but were nevertheless abundant
and ranged from insectivorous and frugivorous bats to agoutis and White-
faced Saki Monkeys.
The arrival at Shanklands of so many vets soon prompted the request:
'Will you look at our eagle?' and the group found themselves examining a
magnificent Harpy Eagle Harpia harpyja that had been brought in, as a
casualty, some months earlier. It provided a superb opportunity for a
demonstration of avian diagnostic techniques and for the Caribbean vets to
gain experience of handling and examining a large and immensely powerful
raptor. Later, a similar examination was carried out on a macaw with
suspected nerve damage.
A larger proportion of primary forest remains in Guyana than in any
other South American country and this is home to many rare and important
birds and other animals. It is well worth a visit and any aviculturist or
ornithologist can be assured of a warm welcome and lots of birds to see!

EDWARD R. FITZSIMMONS 1921-1999
To all of us who knew him, Ed FitzSimmons was one of those larger
than life, unforgettable characters one usually only reads about in books
and magazines. Bom and raised in China, where his father worked for
Mobil Oil, Ed gained his love of birds early in life watching the elders in his
village work with Chinese pigeons, learning from them how to sew the
carefully fashioned fluted gourds into their tails in order to fly the 'aerial
orchestra' on special holidays. Years later, at his ranch in Healdsburg,
California, we would sit around and listen to his tales of China as we sewed
these fluted gourds into the tails of his own Chinese pigeons and I could just
imagine how this whole process would have fascinated that five vear old
boy.
I first met Ed in the early 1970s at one of many memorable soirees during
that decade hosted by Ken Searle, Harry Horswell and Raymond Sawyer.
Avid bird collectors all, these were the men who - along with Fred Johnson,
Alfredo Marques, Philip Wayre and others, were following in the footsteps
of such legends as Jean Delacour, Lord Chaplin and Alfred Ezra - to protect
and breed so many endangered species of birds. I was working for John J.
Yealland, Curator of Birds at the Zoological Society of London at that time
and in later years have often marvelled at how incredibly fortunate I was to
have worked alongside such singular and unique individuals. Those were,
indeed, heady days.
I later moved to California to work with Ed's bird collection. He was in
partnership with Vern Denton of Livermore, whose expertise with pheasants
was widely known. Pooling their resources, Ed and Vem had gathered an
amazing collection of rare pheasants and parrakeets and were successfully
breeding most of the species they kept. Tragopans, Argus, Impeyan, Blood
and peacock pheasants: many first breedings came from this collection. After
meeting Alfredo Marques, Ed's interest in unusual coloured parrakeets was
kindled and I travelled to such diverse places as Belgium and Calcutta
attempting to match up pairs of blue Quakers and lutino Ringnecks.
Being a man of varied interests and passions, Ed was a tme collector:
birds, Chinese jade and pottery, avicultural books, Arabian horses and most
of all, friends. His generosity and many kindnesses were legendary. His
intellectual curiosity, bright wit and indomitable spirit will be sadly missed
but he would love the fact that so many of us will be telling Ed FitzSimmons
stories for many years to come.

ASSESSMENT OF IRON STORAGE IN RAMPHASTIDS

<bodyText confidence="0.993415352941176" page_id="56237795"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
Sponsored by Chester Zoo &amp; University of Bristol
Bristol Vet School is launching a new project which will assess the
problem of iron storage disease in the UK&amp;apos;s captive population of toucans
and related species.
This study will be undertaken on a national level and will examine
(free of charge) submissions from avian vets, zoos, bird gardens and
private aviculturists. Complimentary reports will be forwarded to the
referring veterinarians and will include a qualitative and quantitative
assessment of each patient&amp;apos;s iron storage status plus any additional
histopathology findings.
Preliminary investigations suggest that iron storage occurs in
clinically normal ramphastids. In order to ascertain the extent of this
problem, it is therefore important to examine all birds regardless of the
cause of death. Please consider sending samples from any ramphastid
post mortems with which you may be involved. Biopsy submissions
from active clinical cases will also be accepted.

BREEDING THE BEARDED BARBET

The Bearded Barbet Lybius clubius is native to West and Central Africa,
where it is to be found in tall trees at the edges of open woodlands, wooded
grasslands and cultivation, in clearings in woodlands, and in small isolated
forest patches or clumps of second growth on old plantations (Fry et al.
1988). It is a large barbet, basically black and red in colour, with the mid- to
lower-back white. The flanks are creamy white. It has a large, grooved
yellow hill, with two 'teeth' each side, and the bare skin around the eyes is
also yellow.
Four of these birds were offered for sale in July 1997. They were in
good feather, although a little rough, as softbills often tend to be in dealers'
hands and one bird had a badly dropped wing and seemed unable to fly.

However, it managed to get about the flight by climbing up the wire. One
bird seemed to be slightly larger than the rest and, while all four would flick
their tails from side to side while being watched this was the only one to
vocalise, producing a loud 'caw'. At the time I had no information concerning
the sexing of the birds, so I obtained all four, suspecting there was at least
one male in the group. Later I discovered that the female can be distinguished
from the male by the presence of black spots on the flanks (Fry et al. 1988).
It was possible to see these spots without catching the birds and this confirmed
that I had one male and three females, the male being the slightly larger
bird, as I suspected.
After a few days in a large cage, the four birds were placed in an aviary
measuring 8ft deep x 5ft wide x 6ft high (approx. 2.4m deep x 1.5m wide x
1.8m high). This is one of a series of flights having the rear and one side
enclosed as is the rear half of the roof. Therefore the birds were only exposed
at the front. There was some dry heather hanging at the back of the aviary,
left from the previous occupants, a flowering currant bush was growing
along the open side and there was a large abutilon bush near the front trimmed
back to just below the roof. Before the birds were put into the aviary a
block of rotten birch measuring 1ft 8in wide x 2ft high (approx. 51cm wide
x 61 cm high), but only 8in (approx. 20cm) deep, and a wooden nest-box 2ft
6in high and 6in square (approx. 76cm high x 15cm square) were hung
along the covered side. From the first night all four birds roosted together
in the box. There was a feeding tray near the front of the aviary and a water
dish was placed on a pine log approximately 3ft (91.5cm) high.

Feeding
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999538823529412" page_id="56237800"  page_num="50" year="" vol="">
The birds are fed on a mixture of chopped fruits. Initially the fruit was
mixed with a commercial softfood, but the birds were reluctant to take this
and later the fruit was coated with a dry baby cereal. Softfood was offered
in a dish and usually was only eaten when all the fruit had been consumed.
Fruits offered were banana, apple, pear, tomato, grapes, kiwi fruit, melon,
peach, plum and occasionally tinned fruits. All fruits were chopped to a
size suitable for swallowing whole and all were consumed, although apple
and banana were the least favoured. Occasionally chopped orange was added
to the mixture and was readily eaten. Blackberries, elderberries and
raspberries were always refused. Later, I found that a pomegranate, cut in
half and wired into place, would also be eaten. Livefood, mainly in the
form of mealworms, was eaten readily, but later on very little interest was
shown in it until the birds began to breed. On this diet the birds have retained
their red colour perfectly without the aid of artificial colour-feeding.
In his account of breeding the related Double-toothed Barbet Lybius
bidentatus. Derrick England said that he found his birds to have marked
preference phases, often selecting one type of fruit only. He also found that

have never behaved in this way.

The birds' plumage greatly improved after a couple of weeks in the aviary
and gradually the bird with the dropped wing recovered to the extent that it
could fly again and the wing is now only very slightly displaced.
Unfortunately the birds are not ringed, making it difficult to distinguish
individuals, especially from a distance. This has restricted the amount of
detailed behavioural information that has been obtained.
After a week or so in the aviary the birds began to excavate a hole in the
section of birch. This progressed rapidly and in a very short time they had
bored right through the block. The birds have always remained nervous of
being watched and I never could determine how many birds were involved
in the excavation. I installed a section of pine log but this proved too hard
for the birds and while some of the bark was removed, no further progress
was possible. I then managed to locate a section of rotten birch. This was
about 3ft (91.5cm) high and 1 ft 4in (40.5cm) in diameter. It was placed on
the pine log at the front of the aviary in such a way that the top was about
6in (15cm) below the aviary roof. For a week the birch appeared to be
ignored and then one morning I found that a hole had been started about 6in
(15cm) from the top of the log. Fortunately this was on the side of the log
facing across the aviary front and so could easily be observed. By the same
afternoon progress was such that I could see just the tip of the tail of an
excavating bird. The bird backed out with a beakful of wood chippings that
it dropped from a perch half-way down the aviary. This was the only time I
caught a bird in the act of excavation.
As the birds were recently imported, my intention was to remove them
from the aviary at the first sign of discomfort as the weather deteriorated,
but in the event the winter of 1997-1998 turned out to be mild and there was
never any need to take the birds indoors. The fact that all four slept together
in the birch log was a definite advantage.

The barbets came through the winter in fine condition and the first
indication of any change was on April 26th 1998, when I heard a different
sound coming from the aviary. At the time I noted this as a slow, 'chop,
chop' sound repeated many times. As the birds were so wary I could not
determine which bird was making the call for as soon as they saw me they
moved to the back of the aviary. By the second week in May I only ever
saw three birds in the aviary at one time, so it seemed that they might be
nesting. Unfortunately, it was not possible to know whether it was always
the same bird that was missing.

On May 19th a broken white egg was found on the aviary floor, suggesting
that it may have been laid from a perch. This later disappeared, presumably
eaten by the birds. The next day I put a pot of mealworms into the aviary
and stayed to watch. The male repeatedly collected one or two mealworms
at a time and fed them to one of the females that simply sat on a perch and
waited for him to bring them to her. The mealworms were always swallowed
and regurgitated to the female. A second female was in the nest throughout
this, while the female with the dropped wing took no part in the proceedings.
Nothing resulted from this nesting attempt although one or other of the birds
continued to spend long periods in the log. It was very frustrating not being
able to see what was going on inside or to know which individuals were
spending time in the log.
The first indication of success was on August 21 st when a deep croaking
was heard from inside the log. Initially I thought this indicated a large
nestling, but later I heard the sound from one of the adults in the aviary. By
mid-day the fruit dish was empty, as was the dish of softfood, which was
most unusual. Fresh fruit was supplied, together with a dish of mealworms
and immediately three of the four birds began to take beakfuls of mealworms
to the nest. The birds worked in relays, each waiting its turn at the entrance
to the nest. This was the only time I saw them carry mealworms in the bill
and they dropped many in the process. I could not determine which bird
was not participating in the feeding. It seemed certain that at last they had
young. Livefood consumption was never very high and I supplied about a
tablespoonful of mealworms three times daily. In addition, I offered
waxworms, half-grown locusts and thawed, frozen crickets. They only
displayed interest in the latter, but these were taken only when mixed with
the mealworms. There is no doubt that the nestling was fed fruit from a
very early stage. The birds would not visit the nest if I was nearby and I
could only watch what was happening by remaining hidden behind a bush
about 15ft (approx. 4.5m) from the aviary, so it was not possible to record
many details.
It was September 1 st before all four birds were seen together in the aviary
and from then on much less time was spent in the log. On September 17th
I managed to reach the aviary just after an adult had entered the log and I
could hear faint 'mu-mu-mu-mu' sounds coming from the nest. On September
19th a young barbet was seen looking out of the nest entrance for the first
time. It was not overly shy and did not withdraw very quickly, enabling me
to see that the red on the throat was every bit as brilliant as that of the adults.
The bill was considerably smaller and there was no sign of the 'teeth'. The
adults did not appear to feed the chick at the entrance and would wait for it
to descend to the nest chamber before entering to feed it. On September
24th I found that the adults had opened a second hole to the nest, apparently
a little above the floor of the cavity. This revealed that the nest log had been

excavated to a depth of at least 18in (46cm). The chick spent the next couple
of days looking out of this hole. Each time I approached the aviary the
adults uttered a loud 'carr' sound, presumably a warning call which was
ignored by the chick, which continued to stare at me!
The young barbet fledged on the morning of September 26th. In colour
it was every bit as bright as the adult but there was a slightly greater area of
black on the sides of the breast. The eyes were dark, in contrast to the
yellow of the adults' and the bird was about three-quarters the size of the
adults. The beard was much less well developed than in the adults. The
beak was the same colour and about two-thirds the size of the adults' and, as
already noted, there was no sign of the 'teeth'. This is in contrast to the
description of the immature given in Fry et al. (op. cit.) where the immature
is described as being 'like adult but black and red duller, breast dull black,
throat red mixed with black, base of bill dusky'. The fledgling returned to
the log that evening. From this point on it was out of the nest every day, I
never saw the adults feed it, but then they had become even more wary at
this stage. Once the young bird had fledged I could see that the flanks were
unspotted suggesting that perhaps it could be sexed as a male at this early
stage. The young bird was reared successfully and has remained with the
group without any problems. This contrasts with the situation at St. Louis
Zoo, where it was found that the male was inclined to attack the young on
fledging (Tim Snyder, St. Louis Zoo, per. comm.).
During the winter of 1998-1999 the barbets bored a number of holes in
the nesting log at various levels. At the time of writing (March 1999), they
are again showing interest in spending time in the log. This is similar to the
situation at St. Louis Zoo, where the birds continued to re-use the same log,
in spite of having added more holes (Tim Snyder pers. comm.). Even now,
with the renewed interest in nesting, the young barbet remains fully integrated
in the group.

A TRIP TO SEE THE BALI STARLING
by John Horton
During the middle two weeks of June this summer I visited the Indonesian
island of Bali. An obvious priority was to attempt to see the Bali Starling
Leucopsar rothschildi in the wild. Currently the only refuge for the birds is
the Bali Barat National Park (Taman Nasional Bali Barat ) which is located
on the north-west of the island. It incorporates the whole of west Bali's
mountain range covering 760sq km (approx. 290sq miles), 90% of which is
out-of-bounds to visitors. Within the park's perimeter about 160 species of
birds have been seen, these include a number of Indonesian endemics and
otherwise scarce or difficult to see species.
The Bali Starling or Rothschild's Myna (jalak putih Bali in Bahasa
Indonesian) is considered never to have been common on the island, even
though in the 1920s naturalists reported seeing 'hundreds of birds'. In 1966
the species was put on the endangered list and by the mid-1980s excessive
trapping for the pet trade had reduced the number in the wild to about 150.
The total had dropped to 14 by 1998. The current situation will be discussed
further later in this account.
Bali has a thriving cage bird trade and as one travels around the island it
is clear that almost every dwelling has at least one bird in a small Victorian-
style cage. Bird sellers are numerous and there are a number of bird markets.
I did not visit these, as having seen similar markets elsewhere in south-east
Asia, I knew that the conditions under which the birds were being kept
would be somewhat dire with numerous unsuitable species being offered
for sale. It is little wonder the Bali Starling has suffered such a rapid decline,
as apparently they fetch well in excess of $ 1,000 each on the black market.
Surprisingly the national park is not advertised locally and does not appear
on any hotel excursion list. The vast majority of tourist accommodation is
in the south and east of the island. I stayed at a hotel about 10km (approx. 6
miles) north of the resort of Kuta and by hire car it was a four hour drive to
the park headquarters at Cecik, a short distance from Gilmanuk where you
can take the 30 minute ferry ride to Java. Everything on Bali is haggled
over, even hotel rates, and a sturdy Jeep (a Kijang) eventually cost the
equivalent of #6 (approx. US$10) per day. There are several cheap small
hotels at Gilmanuk, hence it is not a problem finding accommodation. At
the park headquarters there are chalets which can be rented, but on my visit
they had lost the keys and after some searching I was directed up the road!
In order to go anywhere in the park it is compulsory to hire a guide. My
previous experience of such guides was that they range from superb to

virtually useless and when my guide, Yudi, was presented things looked
ominous, as he spoke little English and had no binoculars. As it turned out
he had sharp eyes when it came to spotting things and knew reliable sites
for Green Junglefowl Callus varius and Rufous-backed Kingfisher Ceyx
rufidorsus. I used one of the many birding guides during my trip and though
it was generally accurate, it was clear that as the national park has become
more organised, prices have risen sharply. Fees for guides and park entry
are fixed and you are handed a price list for various excursions. In the
previous 10 months the set price of a guide for three hours had risen from
the equivalent of #1.25 (approx. US$2.00) to #7 (approx. US$11.20), with
trips to the Bali Starling release site having risen from #8 a person to over
#100 (from approx. US$12.80 to US$160), and prices are set to rise again
for the Millennium.
Unaware of this colossal inflation, I did not have sufficient money with
me to cover the cost of visiting the starling site. Fortunately though the
Director of the park was present at the time and due to the combination of
my employment at Jersey Zoo and the 'donation' to him of my field guide,
I was eventually granted permission to make the trip as his official guest. I
got the distinct impression they are not overly keen on anyone visiting the
starlings, which may explain the rise in the cost, which in retrospect, can
only be good for the birds. It should be pointed out that it is not possible to
visit the Bali Starlings at all, if you have not first written to the Director
requesting to do so and giving the proposed date of your visit. I had indeed
done this but on my arrival found that the Director's staff had 'mislaid' the
correspondence, he had though read it and made a note about my forthcoming
visit. Once the Director recognised that my interest and enthusiasm for his
starling breeding project was genuine he was very happy to divulge the
latest information which enables me to report that at the captive breeding
centre at Sumber Kalmpock there were, at the time of my visit, 81 Bali
Starlings. There were a further 10 captive birds at the pre-release site at
Brumbun. The total number of Bali Starlings in the wild was 37.
The captive breeding centre at Sumber Klampock is situated within the
park and is about 10 minutes from the headquarters. It is a small complex
of aviaries in two blocks in a forest clearing. Each block has a central corridor
with the birds' indoor quarters on either side. The adjacent aviaries have a
complete bamboo surround to minimise human contact. I have seen cleaner
facilities but could not fail to be impressed by the keeper's enthusiasm for
his birds. Using pidgin English I managed to establish that almost all breeding
pairs parent-rear their chicks but was also proudly shown a three week old
hand-reared individual. The birds are fed local fruits, predominate among
them being papaya. They are also offered a commercial softbill pellet
(soaked) that is imported from Jakarta, as well as red ant larvae and

caterpillars collected from the adjacent forest and mealworms bought from
the local bird market. The adults are kept in pairs and two of the aviaries
boasted groups of young birds. The rangers make rings for them from
aluminium and keep a record of each bird.
The pre-release centre and the wild birds are at Brumbun on the Prapat
Agung Peninsula, which is reached by driving to Labuan Lalang. According
to the information in my birders' guide the starlings were to be seen on Deer
Island (Palau Menjangan ) but the Director told me that the small colony
introduced' there has died out, leaving Brumbun the only site. From the
park headquarters I was escorted by two rangers for the entire visit. The
small boat from Labuan Lalang took about 45 minutes to reach Brumbun
and landed on a small shingle beach, where we jumped ashore. One of
three full-time rangers was waiting to meet us. Just ahead was the rangers'
office and accommodation, 50m (approx. 165ft) from which is a huge aviary
some 60ft (18m) high, the shape of a giant marquee, housing the pre-release
birds. I was taken about 400m (approx. 440yd) up-hill to a watch tower
from where there were superb views of the surrounding savannah forest and
good birding, culminating in brief, distant views of two Bali Starlings. I
was then led back down and along a track beside the sea for about 3km
(almost 2 miles) to a spot where 12 birds, one of which was close ringed,
were feeding in nearby trees, and felt privileged to witness such a superb
spectacle. The Director of the park had confirmed earlier that released birds
had successfully bred with existing wild birds for the first time in 1998,
which is a real breakthrough. The next release birds are due to join the
colony later this year.
The starlings have few natural predators. Chicks are occasionally lost
to snakes and young monitor lizards and adults may apparently be taken
sometimes by Crested Hawk Eagles Spilornis cheela bido , but this is rare.
Although three years ago some Bali Starlings were illegally trapped, trapping
has now been largely eradicated and heavy fines and jail sentences await
would-be transgessors.
The Bali Forestry Department has received captive bred stock that
originated from Jersey Zoo. Currently a bird park on Bali which is working
closely with Vogelpark Walsrode in Germany, has begun its own Bali Starling
Foundation and this contributes funds to the Forestry Commission. There
is some confusion as to who is doing what for the Bali Starlings but it is
evident that whilst the Balinese Forestry Department are making great efforts
to save the species there are clearly good numbers in reserve in zoos, bird
gardens and private collections, should their efforts falter.

Introduction
It is generally known in avicultural circles that hand-rearing Columbids
from hatching is very difficult and has rarely been successfully achieved.
During the early part of their development pigeons are reared entirely from
crop milk - a curd-like substance secreted from the lining of the crop of the
parent birds and fed to the chicks by regurgitation (Goodwin, 1983;
Grimminger, 1983). Baptista et al. (1997) contains a full discussion of
Columbid reproduction.
Pigeon crop milk has been shown to contain a growth promoter which
enhances early rapid development. In the Superb Fruit Dove Ptilinopus
superbus growth is particularly fast with a chick able to attain 25% of its
adult body weight in as little as six days (Crome, 1975). However, the
growth promoting factor has yet to be identified and so cannot be reproduced
for use in an artificial crop milk. Development of a Superb Fruit Dove
reared on an artificial rather than a natural crop milk could therefore
potentially be retarded.
In February 1998 a Superb Fruit Dove was hand-reared from hatching at
London Zoo. This followed the removal of an egg for artificial incubation,
when it became clear that it was not being properly incubated by the parent
birds.
Hand-Rearing
A hand-rearing diet to simulate a natural crop milk was formulated using
Quark (a soft cheese product), Tofu (soya bean curd), hard-boiled egg, 0.9%
saline solution, calcium lactate and SA37. The protein and fat percentages
in the mix were 11% and 4% respectively. These were at the lower end of
the scale for the known protein and fat levels in natural crop milk. It was
thought that higher percentages of these two dietary components might lead
to too viscous a mix which would reduce the motility of food through the
crop. It was also thought that too high levels of these components might
compromise liver function. Animal and vegetable proteins were used in the
formula to cover the full spectrum of essential amino acids. Carbohydrate
in the form of starches and sugars were close to zero which was in line with
the levels found in natural crop milk. As the chick developed, other food
items were added to the formula which increased the carbohydrate component
of the diet (see Table 1).

HARRINGTON ET AL. - SUPERB FRUIT DOVE
The consistency of the mixture needed to be such that it was neither too
liquefied, which could result in aspiration of food, or too thick which could
result in crop stasis and impaction. The chick was fed using a syringe. The
bottom of the syringe was enlarged to allow the chick to insert its beak and
swallow the mix (Brown, 1995). To offer food from a syringe was considered
a more passive feeding method, with less chance of accidental aspiration,
than to feed using a spoon.

In the absence of the benefits derived from natural crop milk to promote
rapid development in the chick it was considered essential, when hand-rearing
with an artificial diet, to maximise the chick's food intake. This was achieved
by:
1. Incorporating a high number of feeds. The number of feeds for the
first 10 days averaged eight per day. These were spread over a 16 hour long
day. While we could find no data on the frequency of feeds in any parent-
reared Ptilinopus species, data from other parent reared pigeon species
showed the number of feeds were higher in the first two to three days and
then dropped off markedly thereafter (Skutch, 1991).
2. Filling the crop to capacity at each feed. In parent reared parrots a
crop filled to its capacity speeds the rate at which food passes out of the
crop and is digested (Voren &amp; Jordan, 1992). Care was taken not to overfill
or overstretch the crop.

3. Not allowing the crop to fully empty between feeds. This ensured
that food was available for assimilation by the chick throughout the 16 hour
feeding day. The crop was allowed to empty completely overnight, to reduce
the risk of a bacterial infection.
From a hatch weight of 5.7g, the chick achieved 25g at 10 days, close to
25% of the adult weight (Higgins &amp; Davis, 1996). On the 20th day the
chick weighed 67g. Hand-feeding ceased on the 58th day when the chick
weighed 103g (see Table 2a). Table 2b shows comparable weight gains for
a wild reared conspecific and for a captive parent-reared Rose-crowned Fruit

and Davis (1996).
Young P. superbus at 15 days old alongside surrogate female puppet
Weaning was encouraged by:
1. Including chopped fruit and pulses in the rearing mix. This
encouraged the chick to mandibulate the food particles before it swallowed
them. This contrasted with the reflex swallowing action it had hitherto used
when fed the mix.
2. Offering food from a pair of forceps, particularly favourite food items
such as tinned guava.
3. Placing a female congener in its enclosure to stimulate copycat
feeding.
4. Reducing the amount of hand-rearing mixture fed to the chick.

The sensitive phase for learning species specific visual characteristics
occurs at an early stage in a pigeon's life (Baptista et al. 1997). A puppet
modelled on a female Superb Fruit Dove was therefore introduced to the
chick on the sixth day, three days after the chick eyes had begun to open.
Ideally the puppet would have been introduced earlier. The chick's response
to the puppet was to beg for food. This it did by calling and by biting the bill
of the puppet. In experiments presenting the syringe and the puppet
simultaneously to the chick, the puppet would always be selected in
preference to the syringe, while only the former provided food. The chick
would also attempt to be brooded by the puppet. As it was unable to get
underneath the puppet it would snuggle as close as possible beside it. At a
later developmental stage the chick would perch leaning against the puppet,
which was attached to a perch, thus adopting the same behaviour as in parent
reared chicks (pers. obs.).
The hand-reared chick, which is a male, has been housed with a female P.
superbus partner since March 1998. The bird has not shown any apparent aberrant
behaviour and while it is not afraid of its keepers it equally does not approach or
like to be approached by them. The chick will sometimes utter a rapid two note
k peep-peep' call in response to the same call from the keeper. This call became
evident mid-way during its development. The significance of this call being
carried though into adulthood has yet to be evaluated. The two birds have been
shown to be compatible cage mates and we await any future signs of pair bonding.

HARRINGTON ETAL. - SUPERB FRUIT DOVE
Summary
We are unaware of any previous successful attempt to raise a Ptilinopus
fruit dove by hand, straight from hatching. A number of Ptilinopus and
other tropical fruit doves and pigeons are threatened with extinction (Collar
et al. 1994) and captive breeding programmes may prove an aid to their
continued survival. For example, the American Zoo and Aquarium
Association's (AZA) Pigeon and Dove Taxon Advisory Group already runs
a programme for the Mariana Fruit Dove P. roseicapilla and we anticipate
that hand-rearing may occasionally prove to be an invaluable aid to such
programmes.

HAND-REARING PUNA IBIS AT THE OKLAHOMA CITY
ZOOLOGICAL PARK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9020261875" page_id="56237815"  page_num="65" year="" vol="">

The Puna Ibis Plegadis ridgwayi has been successfully hatched and reared
at the Oklahoma City Zoological Park since 1991. As of 1997, 15 Puna Ibis
chicks had been hand-reared. These chicks were successfully reintroduced
to their parent flock without any signs of imprinting.
Puna Ibis measure 56cm-61 cm (approx. 1ft lOin - 2ft). The plumage is
dark purple with a metallic sheen on the coverts with the head and neck
dark chestnut. Although similar in appearance to the Glossy Ibis P.
falcinellus , this species is distinguished by having a shorter bill and tarsi.
Immature and non-breeding birds have white streaks over the head and neck.
Bare areas around the bill and eyes are are red during the breeding season.
The legs are black. Sexes are similar in appearance, but males are larger
and heavier. There is also a difference in the length of the bill between the
sexes. The male's cuImen measures from 108mm-127mm, while the female's
bill is only 86mrn-95mm (Blake, 1977).

The species is found in highland swamps, mudflats and wetlands in Peru,
Bolivia, northern Chile and north-west Argentina. Population estimates have
found the greatest numbers in Peru; 8,000 on Lake Junin and 1,300 at Laguna
Arapa (del Hoyo et. al. 1992). These birds are also common residents in
areas around Lake Titicaca. Smaller populations are found in Chile and
Argentina. The Puna Ibis is common in some parts of its range and is
considered non-endangered. However, the encroachment of cattle herders
and land development into the wetlands is an increasing threat to the species
habitat (Hancock et. al. 1992).
The December 1996 International Species Information System Bird
Abstract reported 99 specimens (40. 37. 22) in 12 zoological institutions
throughout the world. The Oklahoma City Zoological Park has the largest
collection with 21 (8. 8. 5) birds. Five institutions, including the Oklahoma
City Zoological Park, reported hatchings in 1996. Twelve hatchings were
reported in 1996 of which seven survived. Three parent-reared chicks hatched
and survived at Oklahoma City in 1996, and in 1997 nine additional chicks
were successfully hand-reared.
Husbandry
The Puna Ibis has been exhibited at the Oklahoma City Zoological Park
since 1989 when 4. 4 birds were brought together from several zoological
institutions. All of these birds were wild caught. An additional 1.2 wild
caught birds were added to the flock in 1990. In both 1995 and 1997, 2.2
birds were added to the collection. Both pairs of these birds had wild origins
as well. All other birds in the flock are those that have been hatched and
reared at the Oklahoma City Zoological Park.
This species is exhibited in an outdoor aviary, measuring roughly 70m x
30m (approx. 230ft x 99ft), with an average height of 9m (approx. 30ft).
The exhibit is multi-tiered and features several pools, waterfalls, gunite cliffs
and rockwork, and a variety of plants and trees. The ibis are exhibited with
a diverse selection of South American bird species, most of which are
waterfowl and shorebirds. The ibis are moved to a wintering facility when
temperatures are consistently below -6*C (21*F).
Their diet consists of Nebraska Bird of Prey Diet, Flamingo Fare, chopped
and blended smelt, krill and Purina Game Fish Chow. Vitamin supplements
Vionate and Osteoform are sprinkled over the food.
Breeding and nesting has occurred from late April to early September.
The preferred nest sites have been in a Weeping Willow Salix babylonica ,
approximately 9m (30ft) in height. Several wire nest baskets approximately
30cm (12in) in diameter were placed throughout the willow tree. The birds
also built their own nests. Small sticks 20cm - 30cm (approx. 8in - 12in)
long and 5mm - 10mm (approx, &amp;apos;/dn - 4&amp;apos;/2in) in diameter were the most
commonly used construction materials. The nests appear as untidy bundles

of sticks, usually located between larger branches or in the crotch of the
tree.
The Puna Ibis has been successfully bred at the Oklahoma City Zoological
Park since 1991, when five chicks were hatched. Two of these were hand-
reared. In 1992, the flock was held off-exhibit during the summer due to
construction. Several eggs were produced but none hatched.
After the flock was returned to the aviary in 1993, two more chicks were
hatched and reared by the parents. In 1994, four artificially incubated eggs
hatched but no chicks survived. After 2. 2 wild caught birds were added to
the flock in 1995, four chicks were successfully hand-reared. In 1996, three
more chicks were parent reared. Nine chicks were hand-reared in 1997,
after a further 2. 2 birds were added to the flock. From 1991 to 1997, a total
of 36 chicks have hatched at the Oklahoma City Zoological Park, with 23
surviving. Of these, 15 were hand-reared.
Incubation and Hand-rearing Methods
Eggs, when found on the ground, were placed in an incubator set at
37.5*C (99.0* F). The eggs were cleaned in a 10% iodine solution before
being set in the incubator. Humidity was maintained at 48 - 50%. The eggs
were rotated half-way in alternate directions five times daily. The incubation
period was 20 - 22 days. Most chicks hatched about 24 hours after pipping.
The chicks were left in the incubator for 24 hours after hatching, to allow
them time to absorb the yolk sac and to dry off. Afterwards the chicks were
removed to an isolette with a temperature initially at 33*C (91.4*F), and
gradually decreased to the chicks comfort. Small bowls covered with a
terry cloth were used as nests. Small sticks 8cm-10cm (approx. 3in-4in) in
length and about 5mm (approx. 'Ain) in diameter were placed in bowls for
the chicks to grasp. This appeared to help them maintain balance and prevent
their legs from splaying. Larger sticks were used as the chicks grew.
The diet consisted of Nebraska Bird of Prey Diet and krill, blended into
a semi-thick gruel that could be fed through a syringe. Chicks were fed with
a lee syringe for the first week. As the chicks grew, 3cc and eventually
12cc syringes were utilised. Vitamin supplements Vionate and Osteoform
were added to the formula. Feedings were offered five times daily at two-
hour intervals (08.00hrs - 17.00hrs). An additional night feeding was offered
for the first two weeks. Water was also offered via a syringe during each
feeding. The highest growth rates occurred over the first seven days. The
average weight of the chicks increased from 23g to 68g during this time
frame (Table 1). The chicks averaged slightly over a 20% daily weight gain
through the first week, with the highest daily average being 27% (Table 2).
Overall, the rate of growth decreased after six days. The average weight of
the chicks increased steadily on a daily basis, with slight fluctuations when
changes were made to their diet (see Graph).

The chicks were moved out of the isolette and into a brooder box at two
weeks of age. The brooder box measured approximately 2.4m x .6m x
0.35m (approx. 8ft x 2ft x 1 ft 2in). A heat lamp was suspended about 75cm
(2ft 5in) above the bottom of the box. Only a portion of the area used by the
chicks was heated, to allow them to acclimatize to cooler temperatures. The
temperature under the heat lamp was kept near 30*C (86*F). The brooder
box could be divided into four sections to adjust to the size and number of
chicks. Chicks of similar size were kept together without any problems.
During the third week, the chicks began eating solid food. Nebraska
Bird of Prey Diet soaked in water was offered by hand in the form of small
meatballs. Soaking the diet made it easier for the chicks to swallow and
helped them from becoming dehydrated. The chicks also began eating and
drinking from dishes placed in their brooder.
At four weeks of age, the chicks were nearly adult size and were moved
out of the brooder area to the wintering facility used to house the flock
during inclement weather. The wintering area measures about 6m x 3m x
</bodyText>

3m (approx. 20ft x 10ft x 10ft) with a pool approximately 5m x 2.5m (17ft
x 8ft) in area with a maximum depth of 30cm (approx 12in). Landscape
matting and outdoor carpeting were placed over the dry concrete floor.
Perches that spanned the width of the room were installed 2rn- 3rn (approx.
6ft 6m - 9ft 9in) above the ground. The birds also had access to an outdoor
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.987662454545454" page_id="56237818"  page_num="68" year="" vol="">
yard, about the same size as the wintering room, with a sand substrate. At
this time the chicks were weaned from hand-feeding altogether. The chicks
continued to beg for food from keepers until about six weeks of age.
Imprinting does not appear to have been a problem with these hand-
reared ibis. Although the chicks seemed imprinted on people when young,
they gradually became less interested in the keepers after they had been
weaned from hand-feeding. Hand-reared birds that have been introduced to
the flock did not appear to have any difficulties associating with them.
Aggression or incompatibility has not been encountered with any of the
introductions between hand-reared juveniles and the adult members of the
ibis flock.

HUSBANDRY AND BREEDING OF THE PAPUAN
MOUNTAIN PIGEON Gymnophaps albertisii AT
VOGELPARK WALSRODE
by Martina Muller
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9860535" page_id="56237822"  page_num="72" year="" vol="">
According to the 1995 European Endangered Species Breeding
Programme Taxon Advisory Group Survey, only three European institutions
were keeping a total of 3.5 Papuan Mountain Pigeons Gymnophaps albertisii :
London Zoo had two females, the French zoo, Beauval two pairs and
Vogelpark Walsrode a single pair at that time. No successful reproduction
within the previous five years was reported. To our knowledge, there are
also some private aviculturists who have this species in their collections but
successful breedings seem not to have occurred with these. This is in some
ways surprising as this pigeon is a distinctive and interesting member of the
large group of fruit pigeons which deserves more attention from the
avicultural community.
The Papuan Mountain Pigeon is a medium-sized approx. 35cm (13 3 /4in)
long streamlined pigeon with a whitish breast and throat contrasting well
with the maroon belly and dark grey upperparts. Both sexes show an
expanded area of bright red skin around the eyes which relates to the species'
other common name of Bare-eyed Mountain Pigeon. Other features are the
greyish bill with a pinkish tip and red cere, as well as strong red feet and
legs. Females can easily be distinguished from males in having the breast
variably suffused with grey and a broader grey edging to the chestnut throat.
Juveniles of both sexes resemble females but are duller in colour and lack
the red eye-skin and feet. The sex of young birds can be determined on
fledging, at which time the breast of the male is already much lighter than
that of the female. The adult plumage, with the white breast in males and
intensive red orbital skin, bill and legs of both sexes, is attained when the
birds are one year old.
Taxonomically, the Papuan Mountain Pigeon forms a superspecies with
the Long-tailed G. mada and Pale Mountain Pigeon G. solomonensis. The
relationships of the genus are, however, uncertain. These species seem to
be somewhat similar to some Ducula spp, such as the Pinon's Imperial Pigeon
Ducula pinon, in terms of colour and colour patterns. Two races of the

Whereas the male has a white breast, that of the female is grey
primary forest from sea-level up to 3,350m (approx. 11,000ft), or sometimes
even higher. Therefore the birds do not seem to be very sensitive to harsh
climatic conditions in Europe, making them suitable for our aviaries.
Little is known about the general habits of the species. It seems to be a
shy bird and occurs mostly in the hills and mountains. Commonly seen in
groups of 10 - 40, sometimes even up to 80, these flocks fly very fast over
lowland forest in the vicinity of hills when their wings produce a h ushing'

sound in flight. In cloudy mountains these noisy wing-beats sometimes
indicate the presence of flocks in flight, even if they cannot be seen. The
species seems to be partly nomadic as large numbers visit coastal forests
during the rainy season from October until March. The birds forage in the
canopy where they take a variety of fruits including figs and drupes of the
laurel Cryptocarpa tessalata.
The display flight of the male - performed over fairly steep mountainous
terrain - has been described as 'spectacular' by a number of observers: from
a favoured perching place the bird swoops steeply downwards before, with
swift wing-beats, flying almost vertically upwards. At the peak of its climb
it pauses and turns, and then, with closed wings, falls rapidly like a stone
almost vertically, finally pulling out of the dive and arcing back upwards to
its perch.
During the rainy season the birds place their nest, a small platform of
sticks, in a tree or a depression in short dried grass on the top of a rock-face,
at a height of about 5m (16ft 3in). One white egg forms the clutch. Semi-
colonial nesting has sometimes been reported. Usually a silent species,
loud booming calls can be noted during the breeding season.
About six years ago Vogelpark Walsrode started to keep Papuan Mountain
Pigeons when two pairs arrived at the end of 1993 from the breeding centre
on Mallorca. One pair was housed in the pheasantry for exhibition purposes,
while the other was placed in a densely planted enclosure in the breeding
facility for pigeons (which is not open to the public). This pair remained
timid while the two other birds, having daily contact with visitors, became
rather tame after a short period of time. This might have been one of the
preconditions for breeding the species.
The birds in the pheasantry shared their enclosure with various other
species: finches, living in the upper parts of the aviary like the pigeons, as
well as ground-dwelling birds such as pheasants. The mountain pigeons
showed no forms of aggression towards the other species, however, a pair
of Bali Starlings Leucopsar rothschildii had to be removed from this
enclosure after attacking the pigeons.
The diet for these pigeons does not show any differences compared to
the one we use for other big fruit doves and consists of various fruits,
depending on the season. In addition, lettuce, oatflakes, soaked dog pellets
and sometimes even pieces of freshwater fish are offered since we have
noticed that other species of fruit doves, kept in mixed enclosures, also feed
on this item. The fruits are cut into pieces of different sizes - from very
small up to 1cm (&amp;apos;/dn) cubes. However, the birds' preference is for whole
berries like grapes, redcurrants, blueberries, etc.
As the mountain pigeons live in forests at high elevations, they are not
very sensitive to the cold during European winters. Therefore, at Vogelpark

Walsrode the birds always have access to outdoor facilities where
temperatures can be as low as -10*C (14*F) and of which they often take
advantage. A temperature of some 5*C-10*C (41*F-50*F) is maintained in
the birds' indoor accommodation during winter.
Once the mountain pigeons had settled down, the pair on exhibition began
their first attempts at breeding. During the years of keeping the species at
Walsrode it has become obvious that compatibility between partners is very
important for successful reproduction. If the birds fail to get along well, the
territorial male chases the female to the point of exhaustion and as a
consequence such birds have to be introduced to another partner.
The male's courtship display differs from that observed in most pigeons:
the typical situation, in which the male sits alongside the female, presenting
an inflated crop and pestering the female, has not been observed. In this
species the male perches on a conspicuous dead tree-limb, clipping his wings
strongly and at length, and looking more like a bird-of-prey than a pigeon.
The question is whether this behavioural pattern is something like a stylized
flight through territory - comparable to the 'wing-whirring' of male pheasants
- or if the normal courtship display can only be performed incomplete due
to the lack of space in captivity. Interestingly enough, young males display
this behaviour shortly after fledging. According to observations made at
Walsrode this is a behavioural pattern correlated to the bird's sex; it is never
seen in female mountain pigeons.
The first egg-laying occurred here on December 9th 1994, almost a year
after the birds' arrival. Unfortunately this egg was infertile. About two
months later, on February 15th 1995, a second clutch was found in the nest.
After an incubation period of 23 days we found parts of an eggshell under
the nest, indicating that a chick had hatched. This was the first breeding of
a Papuan Mountain Pigeon at Vogelpark Walsrode.
The newly-hatched chick is covered with very dense, dark reddish-brown
down, giving it a somewhat atypical look for a pigeon. When the chick was
about one week old, the adult birds left it alone for the first time. At first
they did so for only a short period, but some days later they did not return to
brood the chick at all. This behaviour did not cause any complications so
far as the young bird's development was concerned (even in February!)
since it seemed to have a well-developed thermal regulation. About 25 days
later the chick, now well feathered, fledged but stayed close to the nest for
some days. I should also mention that at one time there was a young pigeon
which left the nest after 39 days, which was slow compared to the other
chicks hatched at Walsrode. For a further 14 days the juveniles are fed by
their parents. At no time did we observe any type of aggression between
young and adult Papuan Mountain Pigeons which remained together in one
enclosure, even when the parents started to breed again.

Eight Gymnophaps albertisii have been reared successfully at Vogelpark
Walsrode during the past four years and we are now keeping four pairs, of
which two are breeding. In order to increase the genetic diversity of our
flock, London Zoo sent their two females to Walsrode and one of these has
already reproduced. With these promising results we hope to establish a
viable population of this interesting pigeon in European collections.

Christmas Day morning at 7.00am 1997 saw members of the bird staff
working in the dark to shore up broken windows and net over open roofs
resulting from the gales of Christmas Eve. They were soon joined by other
members of the Animal Division and Estates Division in emergency repair
work that resulted in most missing their Christmas lunches to secure the
safety and welfare of stock throughout the zoo. The main damage was to
the Tropical Realm building which lost large sections of the roof over the

hornbill enclosures and reinforced glass skylights over the main free-flight
bird areas. Other damage included windows blown out of the Bird House,
major damage to the adjacent Bird Arcade roof and fencing of the crane and
waterfowl paddocks. Stock losses were mainly of free-flying pigeons and
doves which escaped from the Tropical Realm but also included a number
of smaller birds.
This storm damage necessitated re-programming expenditure and
resulted in not only a completely new and much better roof over the damaged
area of the Tropical Realm but also the re-building of the hornbill enclosures

and later in the year also the Congo Peafowl aviary to a much improved
standard. However this forced the temporary re-housing of the Great Indian
Hornbills Buceros bicornis and Rhinoceros Hornbills B. rhinoceros
precluding any breeding attempts by these in 1998. The Bird Arcade was
also re-roofed and temporary repairs made to the Bird House and crane
fencing. The Bird House having been built in 1965 as a Temperate Bird
House and perhaps given its structure also then seen as a 'temporary 5 Bird
House, had been under review for replacement for at least the last 15 years.
Decisions were made for the Bird House to be demolished and the crane
areas re-fenced at the end of the 1998 breeding season.
The Bird House has given many visitors pleasure over the last 30 years
and been the site for the successful breeding of many species from the first
UK breeding of Bare-faced Curassows Craxfasciolata in 1966, a year after
the building was opened, to our first success with the parent-rearing of a
Scarlet Ibis Eudocimus ruber in 1998. Lilac-breasted Rollers Coracias
caudata were also successfully bred there in 1998. Other species of particular
interest which have bred over recent years in the Bird House include Blue-
crowned Motmots Momotus momota , Trumpeter Hornbills Bycanistes
bucinator, Palawan Peacock Pheasants Polyplectron emphanum and Bali
Starlings Leucopsar rothschildi. The loss of the Bird House has necessitated
the relocation of its former occupants either elsewhere in the zoo or to other
collections. We are currently building on the site of the old Bird House a
new 'Islands in Danger' exhibit. As well as birds this will house invertebrates,
fish, amphibians and reptiles selected to include both those threatened in
the wild and managed within zoo breeding programmes and those that
illustrate particular biological concepts associated with living on islands.
The exhibit will include some exciting species including Red Birds of
Paradise Paradisea rubra from the Wildlife Conservation Society, New York,
and Komodo Dragons Varanus komodoensis from Miami Metrozoo.
'Always Building' was the motto of Chester Zoo's founder George
Mottershead and this was certainly the case for the zoo in 1998. Whilst
work continued elsewhere a major redevelopment of the Humboldt's Penguin
Spheniscus humboldti facility included the demolition of the filtration plant
and kitchen area built in 1981, and the building of larger accommodation to
house the new water treatment equipment, a new kitchen and keeper area,
and refrigerated cold room for fish storage. The pool has been re-landscaped
with natural looking rock-work and a waterfall and new rock effect nesting
areas provided. The new system which is now installed allows the penguins
to swim in salt water where previously they had a freshwater pool. This not
only provides a more natural environment for the penguins but also allows
the use of a water treatment regime that includes ozone treatment and protein
skimming, in addition to sand filtration and UV disinfection. With the new

pumping systems water can now be re-circulated through the water treatment
plant with a turnover of one hour, at least twelve times faster than previously.
For winter 1997 and spring 1998 this meant that the penguins had to be
re-housed to allow the building work to progress. During this time the
penguins were maintained in the Chilean Flamingo Phoenicopterus chilensis
indoor winter quarters and allowed access to a fenced off outdoor area
adjacent to this building. This allowed the birds access to the large but
shallow indoor pool and we were pleased to find no health problems resulted
from this necessary temporary re-housing. Indeed the penguins settled very
quickly and in early spring signalled their intention to breed by excavating
nesting burrows in their outdoor pen. Our penguins are included within the
EEP (European Endangered Species Breeding Programme) Humboldt's
Penguin breeding programme.
Because we have bred so many in previous years our stock is particularly
well represented in other European zoos and we have been asked only to
breed from new stock provided through the EEP coordinator. In 1997, with
the help of Whipsnade Zoo we imported three new penguins from Emmen
Zoo, Netherlands. Two of these had paired together and were amongst those
penguins that laid eggs in 1998. Whilst the other penguin eggs were removed
and not allowed to hatch, those of the Emmen pair were artificially incubated
and as a result two fine chicks were hand-reared. These have now been
introduced into the recently redeveloped enclosure with the other penguins.
Whilst the Humboldt's Penguins were being housed in the Chilean
Flamingo quarters the Chilean Flamingos were mixed over the winter with
the Caribbean Flamingos P. ruber ruber. These were separated again into
single species flocks prior to the breeding season but this disruption to their
normal wintering routine may have led to them being later in initiating egg-
laying than in previous years. Nevertheless seven Chilean and two Caribbean
Flamingos were hatched with the last Chilean chick hatching in October.
Following the damage from the Christmas Eve gales, more unseasonal
weather with particularly wet heavy snow in mid-April caused further damage
and disruption to the Bird Department. This heavy snow continued settling
overnight and not only brought down trees and power lines but severely
tested the structure of the aviaries. Damage was caused mainly to the large
aviaries where the weight of snow on the nylon netting resulted in these
structures giving at their weakest points but some of the old timber and
metal mesh structures also suffered. 'Europe on the Edge', 'Condor Cliffs',
the Great Grey Owl aviary, Mauritius Kestrel aviary, Red-crowned Crane
enclosure and Oakfield parrot aviaries were all damaged.
The Red-crowned Cranes Grus japonensis were sitting a clutch of two
eggs only days away from hatching. They valiantly sat through the snow
storm despite their aviary having suffered major damage with the snow laden

netting roof only just above their heads but abandoned their nest mid-morning
allowing us to take the opportunity to catch and clip the full-winged female
before transferring the pair to the only available open-topped pen. The pair
then surprised us by settling down to lay a replacement clutch and rear two
excellent chicks in their new enclosure. Rapid repairs were made to the
aviaries and subsequently three of the larger enclosures have been re-netted
with modified fixing methods including steel rather than nylon supporting
cables. Two West African Crowned Cranes Balearica pavonina pavonina
were again reared in 1998. As in previous years these were hatched in the
incubator and reared by domestic hens. We had hoped to leave an egg or
eggs from a second clutch with the parent cranes but this year they
disappointed us by not laying until very late in the summer and then only
laying a single clutch. We again had infertile eggs from the Wattled Cranes

Red-crowned Crane with chicks
Bugeranus carunculatus and the White-naped Cranes G. vipio. The latter
may perhaps not be too surprising in view of the male&amp;apos;s age: London Zoo
acquired him from Mr. Ezra in 1949. Notwithstanding this and our previous
lack of success with artificial insemination when we tried it in 1994, several
years with only infertile eggs suggest we should attempt this procedure again
in 1999. Two Gough Island Moorhens Gallinula comeri were hatched and
reared by their parents.

Notable breedings in addition to those already mentioned included a
female Andean Condor Vultur gryphus hatched and reared by its parents in
the new 'Condor Cliffs' enclosure. This was the eleventh chick to be reared
at Chester since this pair first bred in 1985 but gave us particular satisfaction
in being the first chick in the UK to be successfully parent-reared.

were unsuccessful. The Griffon Vultures Gypsfulvus , newly received from
Bristol Zoo, laid but only the female incubated and the egg was infertile. As
in previous years the European Black Vultures Aegypius monachus both
took turns in sitting on their nest but no egg was laid. Later in the summer
the opportunity was taken to laparoscope the female and veterinary opinion
then suggested that the recent termination of egg-laying may be related to a
distortion of her reproductive tract.

reared and represent another species bred at Chester for the first time in
1998.
Two Spectacled Owls Pulsatrix perspicillata were reared, one by its
parents and the other by hand and three Tawny Frogmouths Podargus
strigoides were bred including the first one to be successfully raised under
its parents at Chester. The latter success was due to the keeper's patience in
teaching the parents to feed their chick, and taking care to provide
supplementary food for the chick when required.
Two Kookaburras Dacelo novaeguineae were reared as were three Lilac-
breasted Rollers. The African Grey Hornbills Tockus nasutus epirhinius,
Trumpeter Hornbills and Wrinkled Hornbills Aceros corrugatus all attempted
to nest. Although the Trumpeter Hornbills had at least one chick in the nest
none were reared to independence. The death of our breeding female
Wrinkled Hornbill after two unsuccessful nesting attempts in 1998 was a
particular blow in that this pair had been so successful in previous years.
Following the provision of a natural nest log, clearly to their liking, the
Green Wood Hoopoes Phoeniculus purpureus reared a female chick on their
first breeding attempt, and with that youngster's help in provisioning them,
reared two male chicks in a second brood. This was the first time that Green
Wood Hoopoes have bred at Chester. Touracos also had a particularly good
year with four Violaceous Touracos Musophaga violacea, three Schalow's
Touracos Tauraco schcilowi, three Red-crested Touracos T. erythrolophus
and two White-cheeked Touracos T. leucotis reared. New to the collection
are a pair of Fischer's Touracos T. fischeri but these showed no breeding
activities this year.
Amongst the smaller insectivorous passerines we were most successful
with one pair of Yellow-throated Laughing Thrushes Garrulax galbcmus
from which a total of five chicks were reared by a combination of parent-
rearing and hand-rearing. White-rumped Shamas Copsychus malabaricus
fledged only a single chick losing other chicks from three successive nests.
Similarly the Plumbeous Redstarts Rhyacornisfuliginosus made three nesting
attempts but the only chick reared was hand-reared and proved to be less
than robust. The Azure-winged Magpies Cyanopica cyanea reared three
chicks. Although the Red-billed Blue Magpies Urocissa erythrorhyncha
had two nests of chicks none were reared to independence. Birds in the
free-flight of the Tropical Realm were more successful, with Scissor-billed
Starlings Scissirotrum dubius fledging chicks for the first time at Chester
and Emerald Starlings Lamprotornis iris and Red-eyed Starlings Aplonis
panayensis again reared chicks. Other birds fledging chicks here included
Speckled Pigeons Columba guinea , Silver-billed Tanagers Ramphocelus
carbo and Pekin Robins Leiothrix lutea. The Silver-eared Mesias L.

once again to be a hybrid with a Pekin Robin. Two African Pied Starlings

Spreo bicolor were hand-reared from incubator hatched eggs. At fledging
these youngsters were caged with a single Fischer's Starling S.fischeri which
proved ideal in caring for these chicks, feeding them on demand until they
became independent.
Luzon Bleeding Heart Pigeons Gallicolumba luzonica were bred in the
upper aviaries of the Tropical House and two Mountain Witch Doves
Geotrygon versicolor reared in one of the small enclosures in the Bird Arcade.
The Superb Fruit Doves Ptilinopus superbus hatched a chick in November
but unfortunately this failed to survive. New arrivals were a pair of Mindanao
Bleeding Heart Pigeons G. criniger and two Golden Heart Pigeons G.

1998 was a good year for parrot breeding at Chester. The Mount Apo
Lorikeets Trichoglossus johnstoniae after several unsuccessful nesting
attempts fledged two excellent youngsters. This was the first successful
breeding of this endangered lorikeet at Chester and to my knowledge the
first UK breeding for over 90 years, the first breeding being that in Mrs
Johnstone's collection in 1906. There is now a European Studbook (ESB)

may hope it has a better chance of now becoming established in European
aviculture. Other parrots bred at Chester in 1998 included four species of
Amazons, namely one Red-tailed Amazon Amazona brasiliensis, two
Lilacine (Ecuador) Amazons A. autumnalis lilacina, three Green-cheeked
Amazons A. viridigenalis and three Cuban Amazons Amazona leucocephalus.
This was especially gratifying in that all the young were parent-reared on
show to the public. This was achieved by the Cuban Amazons by isolating
the male after the female had laid and allowing her to rear the chicks unaided.
In previous years the male Cuban Amazon had severely attacked the female
whilst she was rearing chicks forcing the removal of chicks for hand-rearing.
The only parrots hand-reared in 1998 were three Blue-eyed Cockatoos
Cacatua ophthalmica. Two Red-fronted Macaws Am rubrogenys , two Blue-
winged (Illiger's) Macaws A. maracana , one Yellow-naped Macaw A.
auricollis , a Thick-billed Parrot Rhynchopsitta pcichyrhyncha, a Golden-
capped Conure Aratinga auricapilla, a Blue-throated Conure Pyrrhura
cruentata, four Greater Vasa Parrots Coracopsis vasa , three Derbyan
Parakeets Psittaculci derbiana and a Yellow-backed Chattering Lory Lorius
garrulus flavopallicitus were all parent reared in on-show aviaries. We were
especially pleased to breed the Yellow-naped Macaws and Golden-capped
Conures as these had not previously bred in the collection.
Despite the difficulties resulting from the gales then the snow, 1998
proved to be good for bird breeding with some 70 species of birds reared
from a total of ca. 80 species hatching chicks. However, it is becoming
increasingly difficult to be certain of placing surplus stock in known quality
housing and for some successful pairs there is a danger of swamping managed
populations with their offspring. As such, we now breed certain species
only to order and for other species must carefully consider their role within
our collection. We will become increasingly selective in terms of both species
and individuals selected for breeding. That is not to say bird breeding is less
important but it needs to become even more focused. Supporting this the
zoo's plans for winter 1999 include the 'Egg Centre', a new incubation and
rearing facility with public viewing and educational interpretation. These
new developments and our increasing commitments to field conservation
depend on maintaining the recent increase in zoo visitors. Continuing zoo
improvements and innovations like 'Islands in Danger' should ensure we
continue to get the visitor support we need to be better able to contribute to
wildlife conservation and education at the same time as providing a good
day out.

THE RED-BROWED AMAZON Amazona rhodocorytha

The Red-browed Amazon, which measures up to 36cm (approx. 14in)
long and commonly weighs about 450g (approx. 1 lb), is one of the larger of
the mainland species of Amazon parrots. The coloration of this species,
particularly that of the head, is extremely attractive. The forehead and crown
are bright red. The lores are yellow, sometimes becoming orange as the
yellow merges into the red of the forehead. The front area of the cheeks and
the throat are pinkish-red, with the rear of the cheeks being blue, fading out
to green. The patterns of colour merge together, with those of each individual
bird being slightly different. The greatest individual variation occurs in the
amount of yellow, which can range from almost none to being quite extensive.
In sharp contrast to the beautiful coloration of the head, the plumage of the
body and wings is mainly green.
The Red-browed Amazon is endemic to a limited area along the coastal
region of eastern Brazil. In the past limited numbers of birds were exported,
but in recent decades no further exportations have been permitted under
Brazilian legislation which prevents the exportation of this species, that has
been placed on Appendix 1 of the CITES Convention. Despite having been
in captivity for many years, only a small number of birds from the early
importations have reproduced. Until recently the European population
comprised these ageing adult birds, the majority of which had not reproduced,
and a group of second generation birds bred by private aviculturists, all of
which were closely related and already showing an inbreeding coefficient.
An EEP (European Endangered Species Breeding Programme) for this
species was initiated in 1994, but a number of problems soon became clear.
To begin with a number of the important ageing wild caught birds were
confiscated birds held by zoos, which could not move them for the purpose
of pairing. The strict conditions of membership of the EEP discouraged
private aviculturists from participating, so in 1996 there was a
recommendation that private aviculturists should pay an annual fee to take
part in the EEP If progress was to be made it was important that more of the
founder birds which had the potential to breed, but which had not done so,
were encouraged to breed in order to produce new bloodlines of first
generation young, which could be moved more easily and used to form new
unrelated pairs.
Loro Parque had held a large group of Red-browed Amazons for over a
decade, but these had shown no interest in breeding other than to lay a few
infertile eggs at irregular intervals through the years. When I took charge of
these birds we began by building a large communal aviary, designed mainly

with Amazon parrots in mind, with the intention of using it for the group
pairing of non-breeding stock. This aviary was built in the latter part of
1994, and in the spring of 1995, we introduced a group of just over 20 non-
breeding Red-browed Amazons. All were introduced at the same time and
before the start of the breeding season, to help reduce the risk of aggression.
In the event, very little direct aggression was observed. Within the first
week though, two birds had to be removed due to their weakened condition,
which we believed had been caused by intimidation. The remaining birds
settled down well and soon we were able to begin moving the newly formed
pairs back in to breeding cages. That season (1995) we recorded our first
successful breeding of this species, with a total of five young being reared.
The following season (1996) we raised a further 13. During 1997 we began
moving many of the adult breeding pairs to the newly completed breeding
areas away from the main parque, and due to this only one pair bred in
1997, rearing two young.
In three breeding seasons a total of 20 Red-browed Amazons were reared,
but we had still not achieved the successful parent-rearing of the young.
Seventeen of them were reared by foster parents, which included Yellow-
crowned Amazons A. ochrocephala, Green-cheeked Amazons A.
viridigenalis , Blue-fronted Amazons A. aestiva xanthopteryx, Maximilian's
Pionus Pionus maximiliani and Blue-headed Pionus P. menstruus. The
remaining three were being reared by their parents as part of a brood of four
chicks until at three weeks of age, one was killed and two of the three
remaining chicks were found with bite wounds. The three surviving chicks
were removed and successfully hand-reared, though one lost an eye due to
the injuries inflicted by the parents. Although none of the offspring reared
up until the time of writing have been raised by their parents, there is hope
that this will change in the near future.
In 1996, when their eggs were removed, one of the breeding pairs of
Red-browed Amazons was given an egg from a pair of White-fronted
Amazons A. cilbifrons to see if they would hatch the egg and rear the chick.
Giving the egg to a smaller species such as the White-fronted would not
have been our first choice, but it was the only species with eggs at the time
and I really wanted to give the pair of Red-browed Amazons the opportunity
to see if they could hatch the egg and rear the chick. This they did
successfully, giving hope that in the near future Red-browed Amazons will
successfully rear their own young.
The husbandry of Red-browed Amazons was during the time I was
Curator at Loro Parque, similar to that of the other Amazona species. The
birds receive two feeds a day. The first, at 7.00am, comprises a main dish of
mixed fruit and vegetable salad, plus a smaller dish containing about 35g of
a commercial dietary pellet (Prettybird Hi-protein Select). The salad mixture

contains apple, pear, papaya, beetroot, carrot, alfalfa, lettuce, tomato, orange
and pepper, and about 80g of this is given to each pair. At 3.00pm the
remains of the morning food is removed and replaced by a clean dish
containing dry seeds, cooked beans and nuts. Each pair receive about 80g
of this mixture which contains sunflower and safflower seeds, hemp, canary
seed, millets, niger, wheat, black-eyed and mung beans, plus very small
quantities of peanuts and pine nuts. The Red-browed Amazon is one of the
species of the genus Amazona which is most prone to obesity. At the end of
the breeding season at Loro Parque, each bird used to be caught and subjected
to a thorough veterinary examination, during which its weight was recorded
and its physical condition assessed. In the case of obese birds, their diet
was adjusted to help them shed the excess weight. It was very noticeable to
me how birds which had been placed in the pairing flight, and had selected
new partners, seemed to be significantly more active and indulged in much
more courtship behaviour which I believe helped prevent them from
becoming obese.
The exhibition aviaries for Amazon parrots at Loro Parque are of a basic
all-wire mesh construction on a stainless steel framework. Shelter is provided
only above the feeding area and the entrance to the nest-box, otherwise they
are of an open design with vision breaks and shade provided by rows of
dense Arecca Palms. The aviaries used to accommodate Red-browed
Amazons in the off-exhibit breeding areas are of the suspended type and
measure 300cm x 98cm x 98cm (approx. 9ft lOin x 3ft 2'/2in x 3ft 2&amp;apos;/2in).
The floors of the aviaries are about 125cm (approx. 4ft 1 in) above the floor
of the service passage, to give the birds a comfortable height at which to
perch, slightly above the head height of the keepers. Service access is
exclusively from the fronts of the aviaries which extend back from the service
access area and have the nest-boxes placed on the back panel of the aviaries,
where the nesting birds are less likely to be disturbed by the daily husbandry
routines. The nest-boxes are hung on the outside and a hole cut through the
wire allows the birds access to them. Each aviary has horizontal perches,
the food and water area, a calcium block and a regular supply of fresh wood
for the birds to chew.
The nest-boxes provided for the Red-browed Amazons measure
approximately 70cm high x 30cm x 30cm (about 27&amp;apos;/2in high x 11 Vain x
11 3 /4 in), not quite as high might be expected for a large Amazon parrot, but
this is to prevent placing unnecessary weight on the structure of the suspended
cages. The nest medium used is large-sized wood shavings. Clutches laid
at Loro Parque between 1995 and 1997, always numbered three to five white
eggs. The incubation period appears to be 25 days, but this still requires
confirmation from a larger number of parent incubated eggs. To date the
majority of eggs have been incubated by foster parents. Newly hatched

young have strands of yellow primary down on the back and nape, but
otherwise are naked. All young parrots hatched at Loro Parque can be
identified by a closed leg band fitted between the age of 14-21 days. When
endangered species such as Red-browed Amazons have fledged and are
independent, a second means of identification in the form of a numbered
micro-chip is placed in the breast muscle.
Once fledged, all young Red-browed Amazons are placed in a large
holding aviary measuring 12m x 1.5m x 2.5m (approx. 39ft x 5ft x 8ft) and
live in a small flock and get lots of flying exercise during the first year of
their lives. This we thought would produce birds in a stronger physical
condition and provide them with better opportunities for juvenile social
interaction, an important point in view of the fact that so many of them had
been reared by foster parents.
The wild population of the Red-browed Amazon remains under threat,
with large areas of its restricted range not protected from future land
development. In Europe the future of the captive population now looks a
little brighter. In addition to the success achieved at Loro Parque, Palmitos
Park on Gran Canaria has also recently succeeded in breeding this species.
A number of first generation young bred at Loro Parque have been transferred
to create unrelated pairings of first generation offspring and several more of
the founder birds at Loro Parque are showing signs of becoming
reproductively active. Outside of Europe there are small populations of
Red-browed Amazons in South Africa, Asia and North America. The North
American population is now the subject of a SSP (Species Survival Plan)
which is being successfully coordinated by Dr Paul Riello, with breeding
having been achieved on several occasions at the Rare Species Conservatory.
International cooperation and continuing improvements in the breeding
success of the captive populations means things now look well placed to
ensure a safe future for the Red-browed Amazon, in captivity, if not in the
wild.

A Council Meeting was held on Saturday, April 17th at Linton, Cambs.
The following members were present: Miss R. Ezra (President), C.J.S.
Marler, R.C.J. Sawyer (Vice Presidents), K.J. Lawrence (Chairman), M.
Curzon, M. Ellis (Hon. Editor), Mrs. L. Gardner, R. Grantham, N. Hewton,
Mrs. D. Holloway, R.E. Oxley, S. Pyper, J. Trollope, Dr R. Wilkinson, Ms.
R. Wiseman, G.R. Greed (Hon. Secretary/Treasurer).
The Chairman welcomed Diana Holloway and Laura Gardner to their
first Council Meeting. It was agreed to invite James M. Dolan, Jr., Ph.D. ,
Director of Collections at The Zoological Society of San Diego, and the
Rev. Ramon Noegel, also in the USA, to become Vice Presidents of the
Society (invitations that both were delighted to accept). N. Hewston, K.J.
Lawrence, Dr R. Wilkinson and Ms. R. Wiseman were re-elected to the
Council for a further period of five years.
The Hon. Editor reported that he had recently received several articles
and hopes to be able to publish at least four issues of the magazine during
the course of the year.
Membership at the end of 1998 was slightly up on the previous year.
The Society again had a stand at the National Exhibition of Cage and Aviary
Birds, at the NEC, Birmingham. This proved very popular and several new
members were enrolled and some lapsed members renewed their
subscriptions. Those running the stand were kept busy answering questions
on many aspects of aviculture. Rosemary Wiseman, the stand coordinator,
and her team were thanked for their hard work.
The Hon. Secretary/Treasurer reported that the Society is in a sound
position financially and the subscription rates can safely remain unchanged.
He took the opportunity to point out that he retires from Bristol Zoo in three
years time and therefore the Society needs to think about finding a new
home somewhere else. Geoffrey concluded by inviting the Society to visit
Bristol Zoo during the year 2000.
Changes to the Rules recommended by the sub-committee appointed to
simplify and update them, were accepted and passed, and will be published
in a future issue of the magazine. However, the section relating to the
Society's Awards was put on hold pending further research into the history
of some of them.

THE SOCIETY'S VISIT TO LINTON ZOO
by Stewart Pyper

<bodyText confidence="0.99853003125" page_id="56237841"  page_num="91" year="" vol="">
Following lunch at a local pub, members and their guests visited Linton
Zoo. The zoo has been developed by the Simmonds family and is well
known for its breeding programmes. It was our first visit and members and
their guests were very impressed with everything on view.
The collection includes members of the Cat family, tortoises and birds.
The aviaries are generally large, well constructed and attractively planted.
An aviary 100ft x 30ft x 27ft (approx. 30.4m x 9.1m x 8.2m) to the apex of
the roof, houses Trumpeter Hornbills and Green-crested Touracos, along
with Lilac-breasted Rollers, which are able to fly the length of the aviary
and make a wonderful sight. It also houses a breeding pair of Southern
Ground Hornbills, which during our visit remained in the shelter, as the
female was sitting. A young Linton-bred Southern Ground Hornbill, which
is very tame and likes to play with a small ball, lives on its own in another
aviary. There is also a magnificent pair of Blyth's Hornbills which hatched
chicks in 1998, but failed to rear them, and Kim Simmonds is hoping that
they will go a stage further this year. Their aviary is one of many that has a
system installed to enable a light spray of water to be used to try to help
stimulate the birds into breeding activity.
A large landscaped aviary with a waterfall is occupied by among others.
Blacksmith Plovers, Hammerkop and Hadada Ibis. The Toco Toucan bred
at Linton Zoo, for which the zoo shares the UK first breeding award (1989)
remains on view, together with one of its remaining parents, which is now
looking rather old. We saw a lovely pair of San Bias Jays in an aviary next
to that of a superb male Ross's Touraco, received recently on loan from
Belfast Zoo. Linton has two females and a male will be introduced shortly.
Among the parrots are a pair of Green-winged Macaws, Scarlet Macaws
and Moluccan Cockatoos, and among the owls are the Northern Hawk Owl,
Great Grey Owl, Turkmenian Eagle Owl and Malaysian Brown Owl. We
also saw a nice breeding pair of Grey-necked Crowned Cranes.
Our thanks go to Len Simmonds and his daughter Kim for their
hospitality, and to all the staff for making our visit so interesting and
enjoyable.

Two of Australia's rarest finches, the white-bellied Crimson Finch
Neochmia phaeton and the Cape York Peninsula population of the Star Finch
N. ruficauda, are to be studied by Michael Todd, who will be working for
the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage.
The white-bellied Crimson Finch, which also occurs in southern New
Guinea, appears to now be confined to two small populations on the west
and east coasts of the Cape York Peninsula. The Star Finch, which until
recently was a common species around the Gulf of Carpentaria, is now
confined to the same two areas. Michael will study the habitat of these two
species and how they use it throughout the year. He hopes to discover what
they eat and when as the seasons progress. When the Cape York study is
completed, it is hoped that he will be able to study the larger populations of
these two species in the Northern Territory, as well as look at areas where
they have disappeared, to try to discover what is missing.

Each year Chester Zoo awards sums of money to students who are
undertaking research work abroad that involves conservation programmes
for endangered species. Among recent recipients was Gareth Douglas, who
travelled to Vanuatu (which used to be called the New Hebrides).
Writing in Chester's Zoo Life , Summer 1999, he reports that of the seven
endemic species found there, one, the Santo Mountain Starling Aplonis
santovestris is confined to a small mountainous area on the island of Espiritu
Santo. It was classified as vulnerable in the 1994 IUCN data list, as was the
Vanuatu Kingfisher Todirhamphus farquhari. The Tanna Fruit Dove
Ptilinopus tannensis is deemed to be near threatened.
With forest timber being sold off in order to fund a suitable infrastructure
for this newly independent country, the main threat to the native birds is
deforestation. A further threat is posed by introduced species, among them
the House Sparrow Passer domesticus and the Common Myna Acridotheres
tristis.
A BLUE, BLUE ... BLUE YEAR
Earlier this year three Blue or Stanley Cranes Anthropoides paradisea
were raised at Pretoria Zoo, South Africa, as part of the zoo's artificial
insemination programme which started two years ago. South Africa's
national bird has become a threatened species partly at least as a result of
being persecuted by farmers, some of whom poison this beautiful bird. The
chicks raised as part of the artificial insemination programme will be housed
at the zoo or placed in breeding programmes elsewhere. On October 1st last
year Pretoria Zoo celebrated the 99th anniversary of its founding and this
October will host the 54th Annual World Zoo Conference.

According to the recently published Zoological Society of London Annual
Report for last year, the flamingos - 37 Chilean Phoenicopterus chilensis -
have been moved back to Three Island Pond, where the flock used to breed
regularly, in the hope that this will re-stimulate breeding activity. The Eastern
White Pelicans Pelecanus onocrotalus have also been moved to Three Island
Pond and have been joined by eight Dalmatian Pelicans P. crispus from
Villars-les-Dombes, France.
London Zoo's Red-crowned Cranes Grus japonensis hatched two chicks,
but both died within two days from aspergillosis. Following the successful
hand-rearing of a Superb Fruit Dove Ptilinopus superbus (pp57-64), a
Moluccan Cockatoo Cacatua moluccensis was hatched in an incubator and
successfully reared using puppets to avoid the risk of imprinting. A pair of
Red-tailed Amazons Amazona brasilensis has been added to the collection.
At Whipsnade the pair of Stanley Cranes Anthropoides paradisea produced
four chicks from three clutches and a Brolga G. rubicunda was hatched
following the use of artificial insemination. This pair had bred only twice
previously in the last 20 years or so.

What was said to have been the largest group of captive breeding Cape
Parrots Poicephalus robustus robustus suffered a grievous blow when 10
adults and 16 young had to be put down after they tested positive for beak
and feather disease, leaving just five adults and three young that appeared to
be unaffected.
Their owner, William Horsfield, who owns Amazona Bird Farm in
Assagay, KwaZulu-Natal, has spent the past six years breeding Cape Parrots,
one of South Africa's most endangered birds of which perhaps fewer than
1,000 survive in the wild. Reliant on Podocarpus spp., the dominant trees
of the Afromontane forest for food and nest sites, it is the destruction and
alteration of its forest habitats, the removal of birds from the wild for the
cage bird trade, and the shooting of them by farmers, that are the major
factors responsible for the decline of this species. Two of William Horsfield's
birds were rescued by him after they had been shot by a pecan farmer, when
they raided his crop.
The African Parrot Research Unit at the University of Natal,
Pietermaritzburg is conducting research on the Cape Parrot and this virus.
Anyone able to provide information or who would like to make a donation

In 1988, 43,132 parrots were imported into the UK, but according to
figures published recently, by 1997 the number imported fell to 5,500. Some
4,217 African Greys Psittacus erithacus were imported in 1988, but by 1997
the number had fallen to 297. Similarly, the number of P. e. timneh imported
fell from 852 in 1988, to just five in 1997. The 1998 figures are not yet
available, but are likely to show a further fall in the number of parrots
imported.

<bodyText confidence="0.997021125" page_id="56237846"  page_num="96" year="" vol="">
The RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) has launched an
appeal to help save the Chough Pyrrhocoraxpyrrhocoraxpyrrhocorax - the
subject of two recent articles in the magazine (. Avicultural Magazine , 97,2:50-
58 &amp; 102,3:117-120) and said to be the bird that King Arthur's spirit entered
after his death.
The latest figures suggest that there are now only 250 pairs in Britain,
with a further 86 pairs on the Isle of Man. On the Flebridean island of Isla,
once a stronghold of the Chough, the number is said, to have nearly halved
in the past 12 years, and in Northern Ireland only two pairs remain. Peter
Newberry, RSPB Species Policy Officer, has been quoted as saying, 'Our
long term goal is to see Choughs return to their haunts along the south-west
coast, particularly Cornwall, where it is part of local legend.'
Staff at Paradise Park, at Flayle, have been experimenting with fixing
tiny radio transmitters to Choughs, in preparation for releasing aviary-bred
birds, in an attempt to re-establish this species in Cornwall. Two have been
bred this year in the Cobham aviaries of Avicultural Society President, Miss

SOME NOTES ON THE PIPING HORNBILLS AT GUINATE
TROPICAL PARK, LANZAROTE

The Piping Hombill Ceratogymna or Bycanistes fistulator is an African
species which ranges from Senegal (south of Gambia), Guinea-Bissau,
Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo and Benin to Nigeria
west of the Niger River, in the case of the nominate form C. f fistulator.
There are two races, C. f sharpii and C. f duboisi found to the east of the
Niger River, the latter of which ranges eastwards to western Uganda.
From Alan Kemp's (1995) book on hombills, we know that this species
inhabits forest lowlands, palm oil plantations, mangroves and forested
savanna. Large flocks are unusual, with group of two or three birds being
more common. They group together to roost, but at sunrise disperse again.
They are basically frugivorous, but sometimes catch flying ants. Sweet
com and some types of greenfood are also taken. The breeding season
varies from region to region and may extend from October-December or
January-February, with some records for July.
The Piping Hornbill is common in the wild, but is rare in aviculture.
David Hancock, who is undertaking a census of such birds, and Koen
Brouwer, Chairman of the European EEP, could find no records of other
captive pairs of this species. Koen Brouwer did, however, come up with a
record of one which lived for eight years 1 in the early 1990s. Its rarity in
aviculture encouraged us to obtain a pair, not because of the possibility of
holding the only captive pair, but because of the wonderful opportunity to
leam more about this fairly small hombill, about which there is a lack of
knowledge. The Piping Hombill has few evident charms, its bill lacks a big
casque like other Ceratogymna hombills and the bright colours of some of
the Tockus species and this, in our view, accounts for its rarity in aviculture.
Our pair came from a dealer in Belgium. We had no previous interest in this
species, but when the two birds were offered to us, decided to buy the pair.
In June 1998, we were told that a Spanish dealer had one for sale, but could
find out no more about it.

Character and Behaviour

When our Piping Hornbills arrived in December 1996, their feathers
were badly damaged but their general health seemed good. It was surprising
to us to see how when they were nervous or excited, each of them raised the
feathers of the nape, so that the nape appeared to be twice its normal size. A
lot of care had to be taken when entering their aviary, as they were very
nervous and flew about in a panic and we were fearful they might injure
themselves. Over two years later they are still easily frightened and do not
seem to have become accustomed to their keeper. However, it has been
noticed how when they hear the sound of the cart carrying the food dishes,
they watch everything with interest as they wait for the moment when their
aviary door is opened and their dish of food is placed in the aviary.
The male and female together
The pair have learnt to tolerate the presence of visitors and look alert
only when they recognise someone. I (A.M.) am charged with their
management and special care and any changes that may be necessary, but
have a problem making notes about them, as if they see me and feel that I

am too close, suddenly become very alert; they raise their feathers and fly to
the opposite side of the aviary and the male jumps over the female (perched
and alert too), landing on the other side of her. Therefore, it has been difficult
for me to make any direct observations on changes in their behaviour. I use
a portable video camera when the park is closed (I hope we will soon have
a small camera in the aviary), but the views are not always perfect. When
they have been feeling safe and secure, I have in this way been able to discover
a little about their activities and make some notes about them; for example,
the pair like to sunbathe, but have never been seen to open their wings like
some other hombills and never go down on to the ground like some Asiatic
species. They have never been seen bathing and do not seem to enjoy sitting
out in the rain like, for example, the Trumpeter Hornbills C. bucinator. The
most exposed perches are favoured by the male and the female, which spend
a lot of time preening themselves and always remain very close to one another.
Diet
On arriving they were given the standard diet for big hombills in the
park here at Guinate (see Appendix 1). At first only the grapes and soaked
sultanas were eaten, then step by step they got into the habit of eating the
other items as well. We have read that they eat berries in the wild, but our
pair reject these. Sometimes we offer them Tenebrium sp and Zophoba sp.
but they never seem very interested in these. They enjoy the minced meat
which is offered twice a week. We give them sweet com and chopped endive
(as greenfood) and they especially like the latter. The approximate weight
of food offered daily is 350g.
Housing
After a quarantine period of two months, the hombills were placed in
their permanent aviary which measures 4m x 4m x 2.5m high (approx. 13ft
x 13ft x 8ft high). One side of the aviary is only half open to the public gaze
to give these shy birds a more secure feeling. The nest-box was placed in
this partly concealed area, but it was 10 days before the birds inspected it.
At first the aviary was not as good as it might have been. At the time all of
the park was undergoing radical improvements and our knowledge of these
birds was not very good. There were not many perches or plants in the
aviary, although there was a tree (Cassia sp.) growing in it. As it is impossible
to find big tree trunks on Lanzarote, a wooden nest-box was made and
covered with bark and branches, to make it look as natural as possible. It
was an upright stmcture, with a square base and was about 2m (approx. 6ft
7in) high with an oval hole cut in the front about 1.5m (approx. 5ft) up from
the floor. The hole allowed the birds access to the nest cavity, which was

calculated to be about the size required by such birds and similar to that
provided for other species. Concealed beneath it was a large bowl of water
to help maintain the humidity in the nest-box, even on the driest days (on
Lanzarote we get the Sirocco wind). The pair played at the entrance and
even went inside to inspect the 'nest' but made no real attempt to seal the
entrance hole.

In the summer of 1998 we made some improvements to the aviary. We
provided some rocks along the most exposed side, planted some small and
medium-sized shrubs, and provided a variety of natural branches for perching.
In addition, the original nest-box was replaced by a convenient sized barrel,
concealed by wicker screening. When the changes were completed, the
birds were reintroduced in to the aviary and after a matter of minutes seemed
even happier than before and behaved as so they had never been away.
However, it was some hours before they visited the nesting area, which they
use now as a shelter when they want to feel safe.
Breeding Behaviour
We have been unable to find any references to visual evidence of when
this species is in breeding condition (similar to the colour change around
the eyes of the Trumpeter Hombill and the blue colour on the throats of
some Asiatic species). Our only guide has been the sight of the male offering
food to the female and her frequent visits to the nest-box (both the new one
and the old one). However, we believe that, as with pairs of other species,
such behaviour may not necessarily indicate an interest in breeding, but
merely be a way of reinforcing the pair bond. We provided them with a
large tray of our nest-sealing mixture (see Appendix II). This mixture has
been well accepted and used by other African hornbills such as the Trumpeter
and the Red-billed species Tockus erythrorhynchus, but the Piping Hornbills
have so far shown no interest in it.
In November 1998, after a brief display together, a possible copulation
was observed. Because the birds were partly hidden by a branch, we did not
have a clear view, and so cannot be sure! The birds moved together along
the branch with their wings open and the head feathers slightly raised.
However, no further displays or interest in the nest were observed during
the following days.
Conclusions
The pair now seem well accustomed to life in captivity in their re-designed
aviary. They remain quite active and healthy, and their plumage has a nice
gloss to it. No problems have been detected with their standard diet. I
(A.M.) believe that the amount of space they have and their need to feel
secure are very important.
They like to spend the warmest hours of the day sheltering from the sun.
As the collection is housed on one of the Canary Islands, close to the coast
of Africa, we are unable to say how they would tolerate cold weather. Here,
the warm, dry weather is not a problem so long as the have sufficient shade.
The lowest temperature recorded at Guinate during the winter is 10*C (50*F).

1 When I started working in the Bird House at London Zoo in January
1956, among the first birds I looked after was a Piping Hornbill. According
to the label on the aviary, the bird had arrived at the zoo in 1946, from the
Gold Coast (now Ghana). However, Senior Curator, Simon Tonge, has
checked the zoo records and according to them, the bird which arrived in
1946, was sent to Moscow Zoo in 1948. A second arrived in May 1951,
probably from Sierra Leone, and died in January 1960 of arterial sclerosis,
so lived there for approximately eight years nine months. These were the
only two Piping Hornbills which have ever been kept at London Zoo - Ed.

The seven species of flycatcher warblers, genus Seicercus , appear to be
little known in aviculture. A further four species form the genus Abroscopus.
All are closely related to the Phylloscopus warblers and kinglets ( Regulus ).
A small number of Chestnut-headed Flycatcher Warblers S. castaneiceps
were offered for sale in Britain during 1996 and I was able to obtain four
examples. More recently others are reported to have been available in Europe,
including the Black-faced Flycatcher Warbler A. schisticeps.
The Chestnut-headed Flycatcher Warbler measures 4in (10cm) in length.
The crown is chestnut, with a blackish streak extending from the base of the
bill to the sides of the nape; the sides of the head are grey and there is a
narrow white eye-ring. The remainder of the upper surfaces grey to grey-
olive; the two wing bars are yellow and the rump and upper tail-coverts are
also yellow. The tail is dark brown. The underparts are grey-white, with
some yellow on the flanks. The sexes look similar.
The seven races range over an area extending from Tibet and Nepal to
Burma, southern China, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Malaysia and Sumatra.
Typical habitat includes forest, forest undergrowth, etc. In habits they are
said to resemble leaf warblers and outside the breeding season are frequently
found in company with these and other small insectivores.

WOOLHAM - FLYCATCHER WARBLERS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9770564" page_id="56237858"  page_num="104" year="" vol="">
All four birds were housed together in an indoor flight measuring 6ft x
2ft 6in x 1ft 8in deep (183cm x 76cm x 51cm deep). Furnishings consisted
of natural (willow) branches - providing both horizontal perching and two
or three more shrubby sections which, although initially treated with
suspicion, eventually provided the means for a good deal of activity. They
were immediately at home, although hyperactive and almost constantly on
the move.
Bearing in mind their affinity with highly insectivorous species ranging
from the Willow Warbler P. trochilus to the Goldcrest R. regulus, when they
arrived I noted their slender, insect-eater's bill with some apprehension -
and wondered what problems with their diet might lie ahead. As things
turned out, there was no cause for apprehension and although appropriate
livefoods were always provided I was astonished to see all four flycatcher
warblers invariably showing an initial preference for the inanimate mixture
in their feeding dishes.
Their staple diet consisted of a proprietary insectivorous mixture (initially
Haith's Prosecto, subsequently Claus Fat Food, Type IV Blue); a similar
selection of additives was added to each of these foods in the following
proportions:
200g proprietary insectivorous mixture
lOg grated cheese
lOg grated whole prawn or fish roe
lOg grated raw carrot
20g pounded hard-boiled egg
The mixture was made fresh each morning and fed twice daily. A supply
of cheese was dried on paper towels for a couple of days (to reduce oil
content) before being used. Prawns/fish roe were grated from frozen (for
convenience). Eggs were blended into the mixture minus the shells.
Vitamins/minerals, etc were not added to this diet.
I do not use standard-size mealworms for small insectivorous species
since such birds often have difficulty digesting the tough cuticles. Mini
mealworms are a better proposition, but even with these smaller larvae I
prefer, whenever possible, to sift out those which are newly skinned. It is
possible to keep an adequate supply going by investing in a quantity of mini
mealworms and keeping them well fed (bran or one of the specially
formulated diets) so growth is rapid and skin changes frequent. Waxworms
were also provided at a rate of about half-a-dozen (six) per bird each day -
as were crickets, although only on an occasional basis. The quick-moving
flycatcher warblers had no difficulty capturing any which escaped from the
container.

There were no aggressive interactions among the four birds, although
mutual preening sessions eventually led to slight feather-plucking problems.
Although in no sense noisy, they called frequently and I have referred
elsewhere to their contact vocalisations sounding similar to those produced
by foraging groups of Aegithalos tits.
In addition to the Chestnut-headed Flycatcher Warbler, the other species
in the group are the Yellow-eyed Flycatcher Warbler S. burkii, Grey-headed
Flycatcher Warbler S. xanthoschista, Allied Flycatcher Warbler S. affinis.
Yellow-breasted Flycatcher Warbler S. montis, Grey-cheeked Flycatcher
Warbler S. poliogenys and Sunda Flycatcher Warbler S. grammiceps.
Together with the aforementioned Black-faced Flycatcher Warbler, three
other species make up the genus Abroscopus - the Yellow-bellied Flycatcher
Warbler A. superciliaris, Broad-billed Flycatcher Warbler A. hodgsoni and
White-throated Flycatcher Warbler A. albogularis.
Most authorities agree that, in the wild, these birds are almost exclusively
insectivorous although it is possible some small berries may be consumed;
those in my possession eventually took modest quantities of fresh (or frozen)
elderberries, provided they were completely ripe, but were disinterested in
any other kinds.
The Seicercus flycatcher warblers build domed or globular nests of plant
fibres and moss with a softer lining. The eggs are white. Smythies The
Birds of Burma, refers to a nest of the Yellow-bellied Flycatcher Warbler,
discovered in Tenasserim some years ago, which was described as '...built
in a dead bamboo, and consisting of a pad of felted green moss'. The eggs,
3-5 in number were described as '...white in ground-colour, either boldly
spotted or minutely spotted with reddish-brown.' In the same work, the
Black-faced Flycatcher Warbler is said to nest in bamboos or holes in trees.

BREEDING THE WHISKERED LORIKEET
</sectionHeader>

We purchased a pair of recently imported Whiskered Lorikeets
Oreopsittacus arfaki from a Lancashire bird dealer in October 1997. When
we first saw them we were immediately impressed with their small size for
as well as measuring only some 6in (15cm) in length, they are also very
slightly built. Rosemary Low describes them as '...undoubtedly among the
most difficult small parrots in aviculture', a description with which we would
not disagree except to suggest that, in the wild, they must be more robust
than they look for their alternative name is Arfak Alpine Lorikeet and they
have been recorded at altitudes of up to 12,000ft (3,600m) in the mountains
of New Guinea.
Despite searching diligently through as much avicultural literature as
we could lay our hands on, we could find little in print about the species in
the weeks immediately following their arrival. However, in January 1998,
Rosemary Low, perhaps prompted by the previous year's importation,
contributed some very useful notes in an article which appeared in the UK
weekly publication Cage &amp; Aviary Birds.
We housed the lorikeets in an all wire-cage measuring some 36in x 12in
x 12in (91.5cm x 30.5cm x 30.5cm) in which we have previously bred various
other small lorikeets, together with Vernal Loriculus vernalis and Blue-
crowned Hanging Parrots L. galgulus. At first both birds were inclined to
panic and take flight at the slightest provocation. However, they eventually
settled down and were subsequently much less nervous. They were fed on
the same Wysoy-based nectar mixture which we use for all our brush-tongued
parrots. The mixture also includes brewer's yeast, bee pollen, white sugar
and Farex. They also enjoyed sponge cake soaked in nectar but showed no
interest in fruit. We had been told they like greenfood but the birds did no
more than nibble at any of a variety of items they were offered.
Nearly eight months passed before we were provided with irrefutable
evidence the pair might be in or approaching breeding condition. Because
of their extreme nervousness, they had been provided with a nest-box from
the time we brought them home. It was used for roosting and was obviously
a welcome refuge for whenever they felt threatened they would both dive -
literally - headlong through the entrance hole and remain hidden until they
they deemed it safe to emerge. Because we had not seen evidence of display
or other courtship interactions between the pair it came as something of a
surprise when we found a single white egg in the nest-box on May 15th,
1998. We felt it would be unwise to further disturb the birds and left them to
their own devices.

On June 10th we heard what we believed to be a chick calling in the box.
We discovered that two eggs had been laid and the second hatched on June
12th. Unfortunately both nestlings died, the second of them on July 4th. We
had formed the opinion that the first of them may have been weak on hatching
but the loss of its sibling, when three weeks old, was disappointing. On
examination we found the dead youngster had food in its crop but the tiny
carcase looked peculiarly flattened. Two further eggs were laid (on July
31st and August 2nd) but both were clear. We decided to seek advice from
lory and lorikeet expert, Trevor Buckell to see if he could offer any
explanation for the problem. Although he had no direct experience with
Whiskered Lorikeets he suggested we changed the diet to NektarPlus which
he pointed out, is of a thinner consistency to our mixture. We made the
change gradually and experienced no further problems.
On October 2nd 1998 another egg was laid and a second followed within
24 hours. Both adults incubated and during this period we saw the male
displaying for the first time. Most of this activity consisted of rapid head-
bobbing which we likened to the kind of display performed by iguanas.
After each display the male retired into the nest-box.
So far as we are aware, both eggs hatched on October 24th - an incubation
period of 23 days. For several days after incubation the adults were extremely
nervous and frequently behaved in a very agitated manner - to such an extent
that we considered moving items of equipment away from the vicinity of
their cage in case the problem was associated with the environment
immediately outside their accommodation. However, they eventually
regained their composure and no further problems ensued during the nestling
period.
The first chick emerged from the nest-box after 45 days, the second
young bird fledged the following day. At this time the adults again became
nervous, but their offspring conducted themselves with remarkable
confidence and began feeding almost at once. Within three weeks they were
obviously independent and we separated them from their parents. The
decision had nothing to do with parental aggression. Indeed although the
female was again showing interest in the nest-box all four birds frequently
engaged in mutual preening.
In marked contrast to the adult birds, the chicks, initially, had shown
every sign of confidence. Soon after fledging they hopped onto a proffered
hand in their cage without the slightest sign of fear, even when gently stroked.
When housed alone following independence they spent a good deal of time
playing together when they would roll about like kittens engaged in mock
fights. However, after being transferred to more spacious quarters their
willingness to engage in close contact with their owners rapidly diminished!

WHISKERED LORIKEETS NEED SPECIAL CARE
by Rosemary Low

<bodyText confidence="0.99940184375" page_id="56237864"  page_num="110" year="" vol="">
Three years ago at least two importers in the UK were offering Whiskered
Lorikeets Oreopsittacus arfaki for sale. This is the smallest and, in some
ways, the most delicate of the lorikeets which have been imported. It is an
exquisite little creature but suitable only for highly experienced lorikeet
keepers who can devote much time to its care and who have exactly the
right accommodation. For more than a decade attempts have been made to
import this lorikeet into Europe; losses in transit and in quarantine have,
unfortunately, been very high although the numbers of birds involved have
been small. It was therefore with very mixed feelings that I discovered that
further attempts have been made.
I sincerely hope it does not lead to a demand for what is undoubtedly
one of the most difficult small parrots in aviculture. I especially hope that
exhibitors are not tempted to buy the species. It is not a bird which takes
kindly to the stress of being caught up and moved around for shows. In
addition, unless the diet and conditions are exactly right, the plumage lacks
lustre and may have unsightly dark marks.
The two main problems with newly imported birds are the diet and the
reluctance to bathe, or possibly lack of suitable bathing facilities. This may
lead to the plumage becoming sticky. The Whiskered Lorikeet is a tiny
little creature, more finch-like than parrot-like, and weighs about 21g.
If its plumage is in poor condition, it will quickly lose body heat and
will become inactive and unhappy. In good health the Whiskered is active
and vivacious in the extreme - a joy to behold. A friend in South Africa has
told me about the losses of newly imported birds there. They were kept in
conditions under which the plumage became sticky and the birds lost their
ability to fly.
Knowledge of the specialised dietary requirements of this species is vital.
One importer told me that they refused nectar. This was probably because
the nectar offered was too thick. It must be thin, more like that offered to a
sunbird. He had been feeding them on tinned fruit cocktail. On this diet
they would be unable to moult or to breed, because it contains no protein. A
properly formulated lorikeet food is essential for long-term survival.

In Germany Nekton-Produkte has produced a nectar food for the small
lorikeets. It is called NektarPlus and should be available from the Nekton
distributor in the UK (Parlour Products, Farndon Road, Market Harborough,
Leics. LE16 9NP).
The manufacturers state that they have bred Whiskered Lorikeets using
this nectar only, which was originally formulated for hummingbirds and
sunbirds. It is quite expensive but when a correctly balanced diet is offered,
the quantity consumed will be less than on a homemade diet. The latter is
unlikely to be balanced for the needs of the species, thus the birds need to
drink much more to obtain the vital nutrients.
To my knowledge, worldwide there are only two aviculturists who have
been successful in breeding this species on a continuing basis. One of these
is Ruediger Neff in Germany, an exceptional aviculturist who specialises in
lorikeets. He told me that the liquid food for this species must contain a
higher proportion of glucose (dextrose), similar to that used for
hummingbirds. He also offers daily a dry food. He mixes the following to
make 1 kilo: 430g ground bee pollen, 360g oat cereal, 140g glucose, 50g of
brewer's yeast and 20g of a calcium and mineral supplement. Another very
important element of the diet is greenfood. He attaches fresh chickweed to
the twigs of a branch twice daily. The Whiskered Lorikeets eagerly consume
the seed capsules and the green leaves. Without it, their plumage is dull and
the birds are less active. Drinking water for this species, and all other lorikeets
is essential - despite what has been published elsewhere.
When established, Whiskered Lorikeets are quite hardy; they are
mountain birds. But on release from quarantine they would need to be kept
in heated accommodation right through the winter and spring. In the summer
they are best kept in a spacious planted aviary; they will live amicably with
finches. As in the small Charmosyna lorikeets to which they are closely
related, their metabolic rate is high. Their rate of respiration, is noticeably
fast and they quickly become ill if they are cold or hungry. They must
always have food in front of them; in the winter months the daylight hours
must be extended with artificial light. They need to feed frequently. They
also need bathing facilities on a daily basis. They are extraordinarily
enthusiastic bathers!
The Whiskered Lorikeet is sexually dimorphic. Young birds can be sexed
by the age of four months. The female lacks the scarlet forehead and crown.
I have had the pleasure of observing this enchanting little bird in the
highlands of New Guinea. I have to admit that I believe this is where it
belongs because there are not enough truly dedicated breeders like Ruediger
Neff who will go to endless trouble to ensure that it is correctly cared for.

In 1991, some North American Ruddy Ducks Oxyura jamaicensis bred
at Vogelpark Walsrode and reared a number of ducklings. These developed
normally and during the winter wore their species-specific first-winter
plumage. After the spring moult, however, while all the other males attained
their Ruddy Duck breeding plumage, one became completely black (see
photo). Afterwards it moulted into an intermediate eclipse plumage, clearly
showing the facial stripe characteristic of females. This sequence of events
has continued each year up until the present time: in winter, the black drake
shows male and female eclipse plumage traits, and in spring he moults into
his black plumage. Only the centre of his belly is of lighter coloration, and
the breast feathers show a pale scaly pattern. The bill is not as shiny as in
normal coloured males, and has irregular black spotting.
From studying the available literature and interviewing experienced
waterfowl breeders, it became clear that this phenomenon was previously
unknown: no other similar case among Ruddy Ducks or related stifftail ducks
has, to my knowledge, been recorded.
This black drake shares a pond with four other male North American
Ruddy Ducks. While the latter display excessively, the black drake keeps
out of these activities. He behaves more or less like a different species, or
like a female, which tolerates copulations from the other four drakes. This
seems to be rather common behaviour among ducks, with drakes copulating
with females of other species in the absence of conspecific mates.
Is this just a mood of nature, perhaps a bird with suppressed male plumage
in our all-male group, or is it a mutation? Does this exceptional plumage
colour have a particular function? One could imagine perhaps that this
black drake being camouflaged as a different 'species' has a greater chance
to copulate unnoticed among the densely packed territories of dominant
male Ruddy Ducks whereas a weak drake in normal plumage would hardly
receive any attention from ready-to-mate females far away from the deciding
courtship activities. This is though just an hypothesis. If it was a strategy to
increase its genetic presence in the next generation, this phenomenon would
be much more widespread in nature. There are, however, to the best of my
knowledge, no observations to confirm this. Therefore, I would like to appeal
to any members who know of any other black Ruddy Ducks, to contact me:-

Summary
Selected case reports describe some of the common hatching and post-
hatching problems that have been encountered with bustards at the National
Avian Research Center in Abu Dhabi. The hatching parameters of bustards
along with techniques to assist malpositioned embryos, including
radiographic imaging, endoscopy and ovotomy are described. Standard
treatments given to chicks with delayed or assisted hatchings and the
correction of spraddle leg and umbilical protuberances are discussed.
Introduction
In recent years there has been a surge of interest in the propagation of
bustards in captivity, in particular, the Houbara Bustard Chlamydotis
undulata. Captive breeding and restoration programmes for this species
have been established in the Middle East (Bailey et al. 1996). Similar
programmes for other threatened species of bustards have been established
in Europe (Grummt, 1979; Goriup, 1985, Osborne, 1985), Australia (White,
1985) and the former Soviet Union (Zubko, 1992; Sukhanov, 1992). These
programmes aim to produce surplus birds for release into protected areas, to
supplement declining wild populations. Larger Houbara Bustard projects
plan to release between 500 and 1,000 birds a year. Morbidity and mortality
of chicks are potential limiting factors to the success of these projects and
maximising the numbers of chicks that hatch is clearly an important goal in
the avicultural care of these species.
A variety of techniques can be used to assist an avian embryo that is
having problems hatching, these include radiography, endoscopy and
ovotomy (Ensley et al. 1994). Selected case reports are presented here to
illustrate the range of hatching and post-hatching problems that have been
seen in Kori Ardeotis kori , Rufous-crested Eupodotis ruficrista , Houbara
and White-bellied Bustard E. senegalensis at the National Avian Research
Center and we describe some of the methods that have been used to try to
correct these problems. It would be pretentious to say that the way we do
things is the right way so we have also included examples of failures as well
as the successes. There is still a great deal to learn about the care and
management of the bustard paediatric patient.

Incubation techniques
The cases described arose from eggs produced between 1994 and 1997
by captive bustards at the National Avian Research Center (NARC), Abu
Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The incubation techniques used at the NARC
are fully described in Sleigh and Samour (1996) andTarr et al. (1996). Forced
air incubators (Schumacher VOMO-1 SB and Grumbach Compact S-84) were
used to incubate the eggs. The standard setting used was 37.7*C (99.9*F)
with a turning rate of one cycle per hour. Three machines were run at varying
humidities, low (-30%), medium (-60%) and high (-90%). This enabled
eggs to be moved between incubators in order to attain an overall weight
loss through incubation of 15%-17.5% (Sleigh and Samour, 1996). While
eggs were being incubated they were inspected five times a day and relative
humidities and temperatures were checked. Eggs were weighed every three
days to determine weight loss and deviations from 15%-1 7.5% resulted in
remedial action. Still air incubators (Brinsea Hatchmaker) were used for
hatching and the standard setting was 37.7*C (99.9*F) with a relative
humidity of 90%. When eggs were in the hatchers they were examined five
times daily and temperatures and humidity were checked. Eggs were not
turned during this phase. Once a chick had hatched it was transferred to a
dryer (set at 35*C-36*C (95*F-96.8*F) and 40%-50% humidity) where it
was left for two to four hours depending on the strength of the chick before
it was transferred to the rearing unit.
The incubation parameters for Houbara C. u. macqueenii, Rufous-crested,
Kori and White-bellied Bustards are listed in Tables 1 and 2. If bustard
chicks greatly exceeded these pipping intervals, or were weak or not
progressing properly radiography, endoscopy and ovotomy were used to
determine the position and status of the embryo. Olsen and Duvall (1994)
give a full account of the normal hatching process of the avian embryo.
Radiography
Radiographs were taken with portable/mobile X-ray equipment
(Sovereign II, PLH Medical, Watford, Hertfordshire, UK) using screen films
(SUPER HR-G, Fuji Photo Film Co., Japan). Average egg weights and the
exposure settings used for different bustard species are listed in Table 3.
Four radiographs were taken of each egg that was positioned with its long
axis horizontal (Fig. 1). The egg was rotated through 90 degrees after each
radiograph and the eggshell was marked one to four. Radiographs were
developed using a manual system. Using this technique it was possible to
identify radio-opaque structures including limb bones and the characteristic
V-shaped mandible. From each series of radiographs it was possible to

determine in malpositioned embryos the position of the head from
identification of the ventro-dorsal profile of the mandible (Fig. 1).
Radiography was a particularly useful technique for investigating problems
with Kori Bustard eggs which because of the thickness of the shell are harder
to candle than other bustard eggs.

egg). The outline of the mandible and the structures of the head are visible near to the
hole that has been made in the shell
Endoscopy
In the larger eggs of the Kori Bustards it was possible to insert a rigid
endoscope (4 mm, Richard Wolf, Mitcham, Surrey) through a hole made in
the blunt end of the egg. The membrane was moistened with sterile saline
and could be examined to determine embryo viability by monitoring
respiratory movements. Use of the endoscope meant that the hole in the
eggshell did not have to be made larger than necessary. If the chick was
correctly positioned and/or no further immediate intervention was planned
the hole in the egg was sealed using micropore tape (3M Medical-Surgical
Division, St Paul, MN, USA).
Ovotomy
From examination of radiographs the position of the head and bill was
established to determine the entry point for ovotomy. The shell over the
entry point was cleaned using dilute iodine (Pevidine antiseidtic solution.

moistened with surgical spirit. A small hole was made in the eggshell using
the point of a No. 10 scalpel blade and small pieces of eggshell were gently
removed using forceps. In the malpositioned embryos, because the entry
site was away from the air cell, care had to be taken to examine the membrane
for regression of the blood vessels. This was determined by moistening the
membrane with sterile saline, which then became translucent. Regressing
blood vessels took on a ghost-like appearance and were only partially filled
with blood or had no blood in them at all. In all cases of malpositions
described in this report there was minimal or no haemorrhage from blood
vessels in the membrane. Pieces of eggshell and membrane were
progressivelv removed until the head and/or bill were found. Once the chick
was provided with a breathing hole it was left and checked every two to
four hours when progressively more shell and membrane were removed
until the chick was hatched. As more shell was removed the yolk sac was
visually examined and chicks were left in the shell until it had fully retracted.
Chicks were re-evaluated every two to six hours. If the yolk sac was still
visible dilute iodine was dropped onto it with a moistened cotton bud.
Post-hatching care
All chicks with assisted hatches described in this report were given the
following:
Application of 1% iodine solution to the umbilici of chicks promptly
after hatching.
Administration of gentamicin (Cidomycin, Roussel Laboratories Ltd,
Uxbridge, UK) at a dose of 5 mg/kg sid i.m. for 72 hours and s.c.
(Duphalyte, Solvay Duphar Veterinary, Southampton, UK.) or p. o.
electrolytes (Pedialyte, Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, USA) for 24-48
hours to chicks that had a delayed or assisted hatch.
Supplementation of the rearing diet with probiotics (Avipro, Vetark.
Winchester, UK) from 0-14 days, one week before and after translocations
between aviaries, and if birds are given antibiotics.

been encountered during incubation (temperature, humidity, rolling).
On the 20th day it was placed in a Hatchmaker incubator. At 7.30am it
was candled to determine whether it had internally pipped. No evidence of
internal pip was observed by candling and at 10.00am the egg was
radiographed to determine the position of the embryo. The radiograph
showed that the bill was parallel to the short axis of the egg and midway
between the air cell and the small end of the egg. A diagnosis of 'head in the
small end' was made. At 11.30am a 10mm hole was made over the bill to
enable the chick to breathe. Although blood vessels were not prominent,
there was some oozing of blood that rapidly stopped after dabbing with the
tip of a dry sterile cotton bud. The chick was alive, but it appeared to be
weaker than when it was candled at 7.30pm. At 10.30pm the chick had
moved its bill away from the hole and although there were no other changes,
vocalisation sounds appeared to be stronger.
On the 21st day at 5.30am the chick had made an external pip crack
beside the hole and the chick still sounded strong. At 4.30pm although
some blood vessels were still prominent the hole was enlarged and the chick
was given two drops of water orally. At 7.30pm examination of the
membranes showed that the blood vessels had regressed fully and as the
chick had made no progress on its own, more shell was removed and the
chick was assisted out of the shell. The yolk sac was fully absorbed. The
chick was given the standard post-hatching care. There were no further

problems with this chick which developed normally. Figures I and 2 show
the radiographic and post-mortem findings of bustard chicks with this
malposition.
Case 2 - Kori Bustard id 795 'foot over head'
This egg had been incubated under a broody bantam for the first 10
days. It was candled on the 10th day and determined to be fertile. From
days 11-20 it was artificially incubated in a Shumacher incubator and on the
21st day it was placed in a non-turning Grumbach incubator. The weight
loss of this egg had been considered to be normal (13%, low end of normal
range) and no problems had been encountered during natural (broody bantam)
and artificial incubation (temperature, humidity, rolling).
On the 22nd day there was no evidence that the chick had internally
pipped and the chick was estimated to be 24 hours delayed in the hatching
process. At 4.00pm radiographs were taken, but it was not possible to
visualise any radio-opaque features that would help to establish the position
of the head. A hole was made in the large end of the egg and endoscopy was
performed which showed that the chick was still breathing and it could be
heard vocalising. The hole was enlarged and the air cell membrane was
opened. The bill was pointed to the side of the egg below the air cell and
one foot was positioned over the head. The breathing was becoming irregular
and vocalisations stopped, so more shell was removed and the head was
freed. Visualisation of the yolk sac showed that it was not fully absorbed,
so the body of the chick was left in the remains of the shell and it was
replaced in the hatcher. The chick was checked at 7.00am the following day
and the yolk sac was completely reabsorbed, but there was a small 5mm
diameter stump of tissue projecting from the umbilicus. In this case the
chick received the standard treatments for assisted hatch chicks. The stump
was cleaned with dilute iodine and gentamicin ointment (Gental 0.1%,
Sulphar, UAE) was applied three times a day. The chick developed normally
and there were no further complications.
Case 3 - Kori Bustard egg id KB/AAZ/97/04 'head over right wing'
This egg had been incubated for the first 20 days in a Shumacher
incubator, and in a non-turning Grumbach incubator on days 21-23. The
egg was candled on the fourth day of incubation and determined to be fertile.
The weight loss of this egg had been considered normal (between 13%-
17%) and although no problems had been encountered during incubation
concerning temperature and humidity, a problem with the turning in one of
the incubators was suspected.
On the 24th day it was candled at 7.00am and the membrane at the air
cell was observed to be moving and the embryo was thought to have internally

pipped. At 6.00pm the egg was recandled and submitted for radiography.
The radiograph showed that the bill was positioned away from the air cell
and the shell was opened over the air cell to determine whether the chick
was still alive. No movement could be seen and the embryo was declared
dead and submitted for post-mortem examination. This revealed that the
head was over the right wing. Additional post-mortem findings included an
incompletely absorbed yolk sac.
Case 4 - Rufous-crested Bustard egg id AAZ/RCB/97/38 'head
between the thighs'
The female incubated this egg for the first three days and it was then
placed in a Schumacher incubator for days 4-19, and in a non-turning
Grumbach incubator on days 19-20. The egg was candled on the third day
of incubation and determined to be fertile. The weight loss of this egg could
not be determined because the fresh egg weight had not been recorded. No
problems were encountered during incubation (temperature, humidity,
rolling).
On the 19th day it was candled at 7.00am and appeared close to internally
pipping with the embryo pushing against the internal air cell membrane
which was observed to be moving. On the 20th day the egg was recandled
because it had still not internally pipped. The air cell was drawn part-way
down the length of the egg and it appeared that the body was pushed against
the air cell rather than the head. It was submitted for radiography at 6.50pm.
The radiograph showed that the head/bill was pointing away from the air
cell. At 7.50pm the shell was opened over the air cell to determine whether
the chick was still alive. The embryo was making vigorous movements.
The radiograph was assessed to determine where to enter the egg and by
8.10pm after the ovotomy was started the chick's head was located but the
chick was dead. The egg was submitted for post-mortem examination that
revealed that the head was between the legs and the yolk sac was almost
completely retracted.
Post-hatching problems
Case 5 - Houbara Bustard id 740 'incompletely absorbed yolk sac'
This chick was malpositioned (head in small end of shell). It had pipped
from the small end by itself, but was unable to complete the hatching process
on its own. It was successfully assisted without the need for radiography.
On hatching the yolk sac was completely absorbed but there was a small
remnant stump of umbilical tissue (Fig. 3 illustrates this in a Kori Bustard
chick). This was cleaned with dilute iodine and ligated with 4/0 polygalactin
910 (Vicryl, Ethicon Ltd., Edinburgh, UK.) and gentamicin cream was

There were no complications and the chick developed normally.
Case 6 - Rufous-crested Bustard id 269 'rolled toes at hatch'
This chick was positioned normally and hatched normally without
assistance, but it was noticed to have rolled toes on hatching. The toes were
taped with adhesive micropore tape, which was wrapped in such a fashion
so that it pulled the toes in the opposite direction until the rotation was
corrected. A cut shaft of a cotton bud was incorporated on the plantar surface
of the foot. The tape was removed and replaced every two days and after a
week no further treatment was necessary.

This chick was positioned normally and hatched normally without
assistance, but it was noticed to have splayed legs on hatching. The legs
were hobbled with Vetwrap (3M Animal Care products, USA), tied on the
middle part of the metatarsus and the chick was kept in a small plastic
container padded with paper towels for two days. The chick recovered
uneventfully and developed normally with no further complications.
Case 8 - Kori Bustard id 976 'yolk sac infection'
This chick was malpositioned and hatched with assistance. When there
was no sign of internal pipping the egg was submitted for radiography. The
radiograph showed that the bill of the embryo was away from the air cell.
Endoscopy confirmed that the chick was still alive and ovotomy allowed
the egg to be entered and to determine that this malposition was a 'head
between the legs'. The shell around the head was removed, but it could be
seen that the yolk sac was incompletely retracted and the chick was weak.
The yolk sac was dabbed with dilute iodine, the chick was given an i.m.
injection of gentamicin and s.c. electrolyte fluids and the body of the chick
was then taped within the egg to encourage further retraction of the yolk
sac. The chick was left in the egg for 24 hours, during which time it was
given further fluids and gentamicin. The yolk sac was almost completely
reabsorbed and on removal from the egg the remaining yolk sac was ligated
with 4/0 polygalactin 910 according to the method of Heck and Konkel (1991).
The chick appeared to be bright, but had splayed legs on the day after being
freed from the shell. It was given its third and last injection of gentamicin
and a single injection of 15mg long-acting amoxycillin (Clamoxyl LA,
Smithkline Beecham, Surrey, UK) and the legs were hobbled. On the second
day after being freed from the shell the chick was depressed and was
dyspnoeic. Treatment with enrofloxacin was started but the chick died four
hours later. Post-mortem examination was conducted. The blood vessels
lining the yolk sac were congested and the yolk sac was distended with
green-yellow contents. The lungs, liver and meningeal blood vessels were
congested. A heavy growth of Staphylococcus spp. was cultured from yolk
sac contents and liver samples.

The individual cases described in this report cover a range of hatching
and post-hatching problems observed in bustards at the NARC. Cases 3

successfully hatched after radiographic imaging, but the combination of
exhaustion and an incompletely absorbed yolk sac makes them susceptible
to post-hatching conditions. Despite intensive and early antibacterial therapy
this chick succumbed to a yolk sac infection. We have also seen other
malpositioned bustard chicks that appear to be 'physically exhausted' by
the time intervention has provided a breathing hole or freed them. These
chicks have a tendency to fade and die over the first 24-72 hours after
hatching. Once a diagnosis of malposition is made in a chick that has failed
to internally pip we would recommend immediate but careful ovotomy over
the site of the bill to provide a breathing hole for the chick. Assessment of
membrane vascularity should determine the speed of further assistance. The
use of radiosurgery to cut the membrane in which blood vessels that had not
regressed has been described (Olsen and Duvall, 1994) and may be applicable
in some circumstances although we have not had any experience with bustard
chicks. From our observations chicks that are assisted, but are still strong at
the end of the process tend to be more viable compared with chicks that are
'tired' because of delayed intervention. The success of assisted hatching is
mainly down to timing, but unfortunately this is easier to determine
retrospectively, rather than early in the morning or late in the evening when
many of these cases were played out. Case 8 also demonstrates the
importance of providing antibacterial therapy to chicks from assisted hatches.
It is well known that the survival rate of chicks that hatch with larger umbilical
protuberances have a lower survival rate (Joyner, 1993).
Embryo malpositioning is not an uncommon condition, for example, it
is estimated that l%-4% of mature parrot embryos will be in an abnormal
position at full development before hatching (Clipsham, 1996). Causes of
malpositioning include incorrect turning, abnormal shaped eggs, poor
temperature control, careless handling, physical deformities of the embryo,
dietary deficiencies and genetic defects in inbred birds (Olsen and Duvall,
1994; Brown et al. 1996). The cause of malpositions described in these
case reports was not determined for all but one chick, although temperature
control, humidity, turning and weight loss were assessed and did not appear
to be abnormal. In Case 3 a problem with the turning of the egg was
suspected.
Unlike in parrots (Flammer, 1994), spraddle legs are relatively easy to
correct in bustards with most chicks recovering after two to four days of taping.
Flammer (1986) reported that this condition is sometimes responsive to
injections with vitamin E and selenium in parrots, but in our experience taping
the legs has proved successful. The treatment of curled toes has been more
problematic because this condition was seen most frequently in Rufous-crested
Bustards, which are the smallest bustard species maintained at the NARC.
The main problems associated with taping of toes in this species are related to
the small size of the chicks which weigh only 20g-25g at hatching.

Radiographic imaging to evaluate chick position in Californian Condor
Gymnogyps californianus eggs has been shown to be a valid technique in
determining whether eggs that are having problems hatching should be
assisted (Ensley et al. 1994). Through these case reports we have been able
to outline some of the procedures and treatments for some of the common
hatching and post-hatching problems seen in bustard aviculture. From our
experience with bustards we have found that it is possible to critically evaluate
normal versus abnormal embryo position using radiography when there is
doubt following conventional candling techniques. Post-mortem
examination of a number of chicks provided further information to correlate
with radiographic findings. The subjective nature of these case reports
illustrates the need for more detailed information on the hatching process in
normal and abnormal chicks. Incubation and hatch record and egg post-
mortem examination forms are maintained at the NARC. Only with a larger
database of information on the hatching sequence and time intervals for
bustards can the aetiology of malpositions be determined and the timing for

ECUADORIAN BIRDS: SOME NESTING RECORDS AND
EGG DESCRIPTIONS

While visiting Ecuador, one cannot help but be amazed at the diversity
and beauty of the avifauna. Of the over 1,600 species of birds recorded
from Ecuador, many are among the most flashy and beautiful in the world.
At a time when tropical forests are disappearing at an ever increasing rate,
the need for detailed ecological and behavioural studies is urgent. Only
with a good understanding of species' behaviour and ecological needs can
we hope to develop effective methods of conservation. Simple observations
of seemingly trivial details such as nest construction and breeding dates,
provide enormously valuable data that can be used by conservationists and
ornithologists alike. The following nest records represent fairly common
species, that are nevertheless threatened by the destruction of their habitat.
All observations were made during field work on the natural history of
tropical butterflies and other insects, but the excitement of exploring the
behaviour of these beautiful birds could not be ignored.
White-sided Flower Piercer Diglossa albilatera
San Isidro Ranch, Napo Providence, near Cosanga, elevation 1,700 m
(approx. 5,600ft).
On December 18th 1996 a male and female were observed visiting a
nest located approximately 10m (approx. 32ft) from the forest edge in a
grassy field. The nest was an open grassy cup, about 50cm (almost 1ft 8in)
above the ground, built in thick Paspalum sp. (Poaceae) grass shaded
by ferns (Thelypteridaceae) and blackberries (Rosaceae: Rubus sp.). One
nestling was found in the nest.

On December 10th 1996, a nest, similar to those described by Stiles and
Skutch (1989), was discovered in low vegetation in the middle of a cattle

pasture. Three eggs were in the nest. When the nest was visited on December
18th 1996, all of the eggs had hatched.
Lemon-rumped Tanager Ramphocelus icteronotus
Mindo, Pichincha Providence, elevation 1,400m (approx. 4,600ft).
On December 13th 1996 a lone female was observed building a nest
about 4m (approx. 13ft) up in a citrus tree (Rutaceae) in an area of disturbed
forest.

Long-billed Gnatwren Ramphocaenus melanurus
La Selva Lodge, Sucumbios Providence, 75km (approx. 46 miles) e.s.e. of
Coca, elevation 250m (approx. 800ft).
On January 7th 1998 a nest was encountered beside a heavily travelled
</table>

trail inside primary rainforest. The nest was similar to that described in
Stiles and Skutch (1989) and was located approximately 30cm (1ft) above
the ground, wedged in between the leaf axils of a small Cyclanthaceae palm.
The small, cup-like nest was constructed of tightly woven palm fibres and
small twigs. Two eggs were found. Both were white with a pale reddish
tinge and red-brown speckling, heaviest at the broad end. When disturbed
from the nest, the adult would fly only a short distance away and remain,
just out of sight until I left at which time it would return immediately to the
nest.
Ruddy Quail Dove Geotrygon montana
La Selva Lodge, Sucumbios Providence, 75 km (approx. 46 miles) e.s.e. of
Coca, elevation 250m (approx. 800ft).
In early January 1998 two separate nests were located within primary
forest habitat. While other authors have indicated that these birds likely
nest on the ground (Howell and Webb, 1995), both of these were located
approximately lm (3ft 3in) above the ground and consisted of a loosely
arranged platform of leaves and sticks. One was located in the crotch of a
small tree, and the other was in on a tangle of branches and vines that formed
at rough 'Y' shape. Each nest contained two buff-coloured eggs. The nest
and eggs were similar to those described for this species from other areas
(Stiles and Skutch, 1989). Adults would remain on the nest until the observer
was closer than 2m (approx 6ft).

up inside a small cavity in the side of a tree. This is similar to the nesting
situations described from other locations (Stiles and Skutch, 1989; Wetmore,
1972). The tree was located inside primary forest habitat, but was
immediately adjacent to the trail. It was difficult to see the nest itself, as the
hole was only 8cm (approx. 374 in) diameter and the hole was 15cm (6in)
deep. The hole was located on the side of the tree but the cavity was oriented
vertically. Two pale coloured eggs were present but were not removed for
fear of damaging them. The adult woodcreeper would remain quietly on
the nest until the observer's face was only centimetres from the opening and
then burst out, at which point it would fly out of sight.

The importance of observing and publishing all aspects of bird behaviour,
biology, reproduction, and distribution has never been so crucial. The
destruction of our world's forests and other habitats is increasing at an
alarming rate. It is the hope of the author that more ornithologists and amateur
birdwatchers alike will make known even the smallest observations of species
in the field. One never knows when they may be adding a crucial link to the
understanding of a species' biology, and aiding in its conservation.

IRON CONTENT OF RAMPHASTID DIETS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998493617647059" page_id="56237884"  page_num="130" year="" vol="">

One of the major causes of mortality in Ramphastids is haemochromatosis
- iron storage disease. Currently, this condition is controlled by dietary
management. Low-iron foods have become the focus of considerable
attention, with several companies manufacturing diets to meet this specific
requirement. The results of laboratory analysis of foods by Bristol Vet School
are presented in the following table. It has been recommended that the diets
of susceptible softbills should contain less than 40 ppm of iron.
Ramphastids are frugivores and, although we do not yet have the results
for fruits, it is likely that most fruits are low in iron. The limited voluntary
food intake precludes the exclusive use of fruits because the higher energy
demands of outdoor housing cannot be met without the use of a nutrient-
dense ration. Meat contains high levels of iron, in a form that is more readily
absorbed than plant or mineral sources, and the common practice of feeding
canine diets is to be discouraged. Vitamin and mineral premixes invariably
contain high levels of iron and previous studies have shown even simple
calcium supplements to contain as much as 1 l,000ppm.
Tannins chelate iron and thereby reduce its absorption. Water sources in
the tropical rainforests of Central and South America are reportedly high in
tannins and it may be that toucans in captivity are susceptible to iron overload
because of a genetic adaptation to tannin-complexed iron. Captive birds
rapidly become accustomed to the addition of dilute tea to the drinking water
but this supplement is not without its problems. Tannins also reduce food
intake and protein digestion, and caffeine is both a stimulant and diuretic.
One collection reported the use of clays as a potential means of controlling
iron absorptions. We analysed two clay samples that were claimed to be
similar in composition to deposits located in Ecuador. The iron content of
these was exceptional. It is highly likely that more iron would be released
into the intestine as a result of administering the clay than would be
beneficially bound from the remainder of the diet.
All soils are likely to be high in iron and Ramphastids frequently swallow
samples, either intentionally or inadvertently with food. In relation to the
potential iron-intake by this route, low iron diets may be of little significance
in controlling the problem.

THE PRESIDENT'S GARDEN PARTY 1998 &amp; 1999

The 1998 President's Garden Party was held on Sunday July 12th and
that for 1999 on Sunday July 11 th, by kind invitation of our President, Miss
Ruth Ezra, and Vice President, Raymond Sawyer. There was an immense
contrast in the weather for these two events - the 1998 garden party was
held in overcast conditions, following a morning of incessant rain, while
this year it was a hot day which made viewing the birds difficult, as they hid
away until after tea, which was the best time to view them. In 1998 we were
Avicultural Society President, Miss Ruth Ezra, was present when
Chairman, Ken Lawrence (left), made the presentation to Raymond
of a painting of 15 species bred at Cobham
shown many interesting birds, including Blue-bellied Rollers which had bred
and achieved what is probably the UK first breeding of this species. The
pair bred again this year, and a second pair also bred. A detailed account of
those breedings is being prepared for publication in the magazine. In 1997,
I wrote about a pair of Red-billed Oxpeckers. In 1998, there were six at
Cobham, which had hatched chicks but failed to rear them. This year there
are two, four of them having gone to Birdworld, near Famham. Waders,
including Avocets, Black-necked Stilts and Masked Plovers, bred well in
1998 and again this year.
One of the highlights amongst the doves and pigeons in 1998 was that
all three pairs of Bartlett's Bleeding Heart Pigeons bred successfully. This
year we saw more young. In the waterfall aviary there is a group of Pink-

necked Fruit Doves, a species I cannot recall having seen before. Our member
Derek Goodwin, in Pigeons and Doves of the World (Trustees of the British
Museum (Natural History), 1970), was unable to provide much information
about this species. This must have changed now though, because it is being
bred in collections such as those at San Diego and Riverbanks Zoo &amp;
Botanical Gardens, South Carolina. It is a little larger than a Barbary Dove.
The head, neck and upper breast are bright purplish pink, deepening to
foxglove red on the middle of the breast, which is bordered by a white and
then a greenish black band; the belly is grey. The back is green.
There appeared to be seven Carmine Bee-eaters which have been
provided with new nest tunnels in an effort to encourage them to breed, but
to date nothing has happened. The collection also includes Red-throated
and White-throated Bee-eaters. I was really taken by a Garnet Pitta, which
unfortunately was not easy to see. It is another species I cannot recall having
seen before. There has been an increase recently in the variety of sunbirds
being kept at Cobham, with the return of old favourites such as the Golden-
winged, Bronze, Malachite, Scarlet-tufted Malachite (which Raymond calls
johnstoni ) and Tacazze, plus the Splendid, Beautiful, Scarlet-chested and a
wonderful Mrs Gould's. The latter looked magnificent, displaying its full
range of colours as it came forward to show itself off. Other nectar-feeders
on view included a Ruby-Topaz Hummingbird and a Giant Hummingbird.
The latter lives in the waterfall aviary, which is the aviary in which the
second pair of Blue-bellied Rollers bred. The Blue-faced Honeyeaters are
not breeding at present but the small colony was lovely to watch.
Red-billed Choughs had bred for the second year, after earlier
disappointments, which included one surgically sexed pair later proving to
be two females! Several collections have this species but breeding results
are not very encouraging, while at Cobham they appear to be reproducing
well. The Island Thrushes continue to breed, as do the Green Wood Hoopoes
and Black-cheeked Woodpeckers. The Keel-billed Toucans have been moved
to an aviary at the back in an effort to give them more privacy. As on
previous visits, we saw a good selection of starlings, though only the Superb
Spreos are breeding at present and appear to be prolific.
These are just a few notes on my personal observations made during the
short time I had to look at the birds. There were undoubtably birds which I
missed that were seen fyy others and deserve a mention.
During tea Raymond was presented with a marvellous painting showing
15 species bred at Cobham, which were UK first breedings. The Chairman,
Ken Lawrence, also presented a watercolour painting of Frinton-on-Sea to
our much loved President, who kindly donated all the monies from the ticket
sales, amounting to approximately #1,200 (about US$2,000), to the .Society's
funds and for this we are all most grateful.

Saving the Endangered Orange-bellied Parrakeet (Avicultural
Magazine 104, 2: 49-52) by J.R. Hodges
We wish to respond to this article on behalf of the Orange-bellied Parrot
Recovery Team and all who have supported our endeavours over the last 15
years. The article contained some surprising inaccuracies and gives a false
impression of the work we have done and the difficulties we still face. The
team co-operated with Hodges (providing light plane transport for one of
his visits to Melaleuca) and we are disappointed that he did not check his
facts more carefully. The team strongly values input from aviculturists.
In his article, J.R. Hodges raised a number of his personal concerns with
the recovery programme, and suggested that some could be solved by
fostering more active involvement by aviculturists, and attracting revenue
through the sale of captive-bred birds. Such matters have been considered
by the team over the years and some of them have been actively implemented.
For example, we have two experienced aviculturists on our team (Peter
Brown and Len Robinson) as well as zoo staff. We welcome expert advice
from aviculturists in relation to husbandry of the captive population. We
recognise the obvious value of establishing more than one captive breeding
colony and now have three captive colonies (not one or two as claimed),
one in Tasmania and two in Victoria, including one with a private aviculturist.
Last season a record 54 young birds were reared from a captive population
of 83 adults in these three colonies. It is doubtful that such success would
have been achieved if the birds had been more dispersed.
The captive breeding programme was instigated mainly as an insurance
policy, to keep a healthy stock of captive birds in case the species did not
survive in the wild. The programme has been far more integral and useful
than that, allowing us to supplement wild stocks in new habitats and to learn
much about the potentials and pitfalls of reintroduction by liberating banded
birds as acknowledged by Hodges. We believe it has been a success, and
although we will always strive for improvement and look at new ideas we
do not accept that a radically different approach is needed.
Management of the wild population is the area where improvements
really are needed. Here we share Hodges' concern that the species remains
critically endangered, and numbers have only increased marginally in the
wild since our work began. Nevertheless, some achievements have been
made. The previous decline has been arrested, and much remaining habitat
has been reserved. Valuable management initiatives have been implemented
in much of the birds' summer and winter range, but clearly they have not
worked as well as expected and new initiatives need to be tried.

Currently we are helping develop better fire regimes in the breeding
habitats of south-west Tasmania, and attempting to restore some previously
used winter habitats in Victoria and South Australia. Our philosophy is to
make new habitats close to others in current use, rather than risk unwittingly
damaging existing habitats by misguided attempts to improve them. Habitat
restoration or creation is a delicate and expensive task, that needs to proceed
in a spirit of adaptive management. We are proceeding as fast as resources
permit, and need to accelerate our efforts. The programme has been well
supported by industry and government over the years but now we see an
urgent need for more resources, just when some fund donors were expecting
demands to decrease.
Here, Hodges may well point to sales of captive-bred birds as a revenue
raiser. Tempting as this is, the team has serious reservations on two main
grounds. Firstly, there is a widely held view that legal trade in rare birds can
place new pressures on wild populations through legitimate demands for
wild stock to diversify gene pools, and by acting as a cloak for illegal trade
involving a careless or unscrupulous minority of aviculturists. This view
can be debated at length, and is not held by all members of the OBP Recovery
Team. However, it is the dominant view among wildlife policy makers in
Australia, and hence has influenced the thinking of the Recovery Team and
its scope for actions of this sort. Secondly, the current government philosophy
(across most political parties) is that commercial trade is a matter for the
private sector, and government involvement should be reduced to a minimum.
Yet species recovery programmes need government involvement because
they are done for public good not private gain. Hence a practical issue
arises about how some of the benefits of private trade in birds could be
diverted to the common good of conserving the species in the wild. This
may not be an insurmountable problem, but it is not as simple as suggested
by Hodges. Hodges' example of the Naretha Blue-bonnets may provide a
model, but we know this situation differs in a number of important respects.
One of the simplest ways of attracting more funds to the programme is to
ask people to support it, and we have raised some funds from birdwatchers,
conservationists and aviculturists in Australia (and overseas, to a much lesser
extent) by seeking donations. Aviculturists as a group can be highly
supportive of conservation efforts, both through their own captive breeding
efforts and through financial support of programmes to conserve species in
the wild.
Because the greatest need for Orange-bellied Parrots is to conserve the
wild population and its habitat, the best way in which aviculturists can help
the species is to support our efforts to conserve habitat and increase the wild
population. Any donations or offers of advice would be verv welcome and
should be addressed to Jon Starks at Birds Australia (a non-government

We share Hodges' enthusiasm for this beautiful bird and the remarkable
country it inhabits, and will not rest until we have done what we can to
conserve it in captivity and the wild.
Richard H. Loyn on behalf of the Orange-bellied Parrot Recovery Team
(Chair, Mark Holdsworth, Tasmanian Parks &amp; Wildlife, GPO Box 44A,
Hobart, Tasmania 7001, Australia (E-mail: markh@dpiwe.tas.gov.au)).
Prof. Hodges was asked if he wished to respond and this is what he
wrote :-
I was pleased to read the above letter. At least somebody had read my
article. However, I was surprised by the writer's aggressive attitude in his
first paragraph where he refers to my 'surprising inaccuracies' and to the
'false impression' which I gave. He does not specify what the inaccuracies
were or how the false impression could be derived. He goes on to state that
the recovery team co-operated with me and even 'provided light plane
transport for one of my visits to Melaleuca.' The only member of the team
I have ever been able to contact, despite making several efforts, is Peter
Brown whom I first met about 40 years ago when he worked for Reg
Partridge. The one occasion on which I visited Melaleuca was with my wife
and two friends from the University of Hobart. We flew with 'Par Avion', a
small commercial airline, at our own expense!
Mr Loyn obviously shares my enthusiasm for and interest in this lovely
member of the exquisite genus Neophema. I do not agree that the Orange-
bellied species will be saved from extinction by work on its habitat and the
liberation into it of captive-bred specimens and I deplore the fact that vast
sums of money have been wasted in this way. The migratory behaviour of
the species exacerbates the problems associated with preventing its
extinction. However, I think that it can be saved by captive breeding. I
believe that it would already have been safe (like Splendid, Turquoisine and
Princess of Wales Parrakeets, for example) if most of the captive-bred
specimens had been distributed to responsible aviculturists. Surely having
perfect specimens of such an attractive species in appropriate aviaries is
infinately more desirable than stuffed, decaying, dusty specimens in
museums.

STARLINGS AND MYNAS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987210421052632" page_id="56237891"  page_num="137" year="" vol="">
Starlings and Mynas by Chris Feare and Adrian Craig is a welcome
recent addition to the Helm Identification Guides. Many of the species are
familiar avicultural subjects, but a surprising number of the others are
unfamiliar and are probably unknown in aviculture.
The first thing I did was to flick through the 32 colour plates grouped
together towards the front of this attractively presented 285 page guide.
Painted by Barry Croucher, Chris Shields and Kamol Komolphalin, they
show all 114 species (which includes the two oxpeckers), sex differences
when they occur and distinctive juvenile plumages, as well as various well
differentiated races. I immediately spotted several species I cannot recall
having seen portrayed before, among them the African White-collared
Starling, Madagascar Starling, some of the Sulawesi endemic starlings/
mynas, the Polynesian, Micronesian and Melanesian Aplonis glossy starlings,
and the White-eyed Starling which possesses two long tail streamers, up to
three times the length of the other tail feathers.
I next checked the species accounts, choosing three species I know well
- the Emerald, Violet-backed (though here the authors revert to the name
Amethyst Starling; the names Plum-coloured and Violet-backed Starling
are given secondary or alternative names status) and Splendid Starlings. I
quickly spotted the names Pyper, Wilkinson, Ellis and Sawyer and, on
checking, found that the authors cite several references from th q Avicultural
Magazine. Considering the number of Emerald Starlings that seem to
continue to be exported from West Africa, it comes as a surprise to learn that
in the wild the nesting habits of this species remain undescribed, and that
the authors have had to rely largely on what information has been published
in this magazine.
The fact that each species is illustrated in colour, there is a detailed
description and measurements for both sexes (females are usually smaller),
along with the quality of the information to be found under the headings,
Food and Feeding, Breeding, and Behaviour, mean this guide will prove
invaluable to aviculturists interested in these species.
I was surprised to see that the Superb, Hildebrandt's, Shelley's and the
Chestnut-bellied Starling are placed not in the genus Spreo but in the genus
Lamprotornis, along with the Golden-breasted Starling. The other member
of the genus Cosmopsarus (which ceases to exist), the Ashy Starling, is
placed in the genus Spreo along with the African Pied, Fischer's and the
White-crowned Starling. What, I wonder, will aviculturists who are familiar
with these species think of these changes? The reasons for them, which

mostly seem to be to do with the structure of their feathers are explained by
the authors, who at one point say: 'such a radical rearrangement is bound to
stimulate debate and further study.' Perhaps some members will have views
on these changes and be able to add to what is known about some of the
species involved.
It is also a fascinating book to dip into. Included are sections on Starlings
in Captivity, Conservation and - Starlings as Food! Touched upon briefly is
the release into the wild of captive bred Bali Mynas (the name used in this
guide), some of which have apparently turned-up later in bird shops. I was
also interested to read what little is known about the Nias Hill Myna, which
is probably threatened both by the destruction of the indigenous forest on
Nias and other islands off the south-west coast of Sumatra, and pressure
from trappers, as it is said to be famous for its quality as a talking bird. In
the late 1950s I looked after one in the Bird House at London Zoo, but have
not seen another since then. I remember it being considerably larger than
the other hill mynas, which is not quite the impression one gets from the
plate showing these birds. It did not talk but made various sounds (some
possibly in an attempt to talk) in a deep voice and screamed and whistling
extremely loudly. When it opened its bill to its fullest extent it had an
enormous gape and looked as so it could almost swallow you!
This guide is then, even at #32, a 'must' for aviculturists, for identifying
the many species and learning more about them. The Helm Identification
Guides are published by Christopher Helm (Publishers) Ltd, a subsidiary of

My only (minor) criticism of Tanagers, a recent addition to the range of
Helm Identification Guides, published by Christopher Helm Ltd is reflected
in Theodore A. Parker's Foreword in which he refers to the subjects a being
'...among the most colorful and vibrant of New World birds'. Perhaps I am
being a little unkind but, like most aviculturists who have first-hand
experience of this most colourful of families, my first reaction to the otherwise
excellent plates is a lack of 'vibrant' colour; even that most dazzlingly
iridescent species, the Paradise Tanager Tangara chilensis fails to capitalise
on the sheer brilliance of its plumage by metaphorically leaping out of the
plate it shares with nine other members of the genus - including other
'luminaries' such as the Seven-coloured T.fastuosa and Red-necked Tanagers
T. cyanocephala.

More than 240 species of tanagers are dealt with in this excellent, updated
and invaluable monograph by Phyllis and Morton Islers. The latest edition
includes new information (including new species) since its first publication
in 1987. Although essentially an identification guide and therefore mainly
of interest to ornithologists and others of like interests, so little in the way of
comprehrensive literature on this large and diverse family exists that the
Islers' work will be welcomed by a wider audience, including aviculturists.
The authors comment that they have seen the majority of tanagers in the
field and have thus had the opportunity to study the behaviours of some
species in detail.
The colour plates, by Morton Isler, seem to owe much to museum skin
collections but are little the worse for that (except for their lack of vivid
colour!) and are meticulously accurate. Sexual differences are shown for
almost 50% of species, while more than one race is illustrated for 74 tanagers
(as many as six for some of the others). More to the point, the arrangement
and scale of species on plates makes identification particularly
straightforward.
Information is concise but very informative and is contained under such
headings as Geographic Range, Elevational Range, Habitat and Behaviour,
Vocalisations, and Breeding. Sources of information are provided for each
species. Considerable detail is contained under Habitat and Behaviour, much
of it, ranging from food and environment to stomach contents, will be of
value to aviculturists.
The book consists of 406 pages including 32 full-page colour plates.
Three pages of literature are cited in the 1999 updated edition, together with
a very useful 18 pages of references. Prospective avicultural purchasers
may be encouraged by the fact that names familiar to them, including
Delacour, Scamell, Ruschi, Murray and others are included among these
sources of information.
Definitely a worthwhile acquisition for any ornithological or avicultural
library whose owner has an interest in New World species.

The mischievous and destructive nature of the Kea Nestor notabilis is
legendary. It is, I believe, the most intelligent (and among the most endearing)
of the parrots which I have had in my care. New Zealand's mountain parrot
evolved in harsh conditions; it needed to be very resourceful to survive.
Unfortunately, only an estimated 3,000 survive today. Yet it is an enormous
tourist attraction in some localities - and has also attracted much unfavourable
publicity due to its playful habits.
In Kea, Bird of Paradox , Judy Diamond and Alan Bond from the
University of Nebraska, explore certain aspects of the Kea's history and
natural history. They start by reconstructing the environment in which the
Kea evolved, an environment it shared with moas and other long extinct
species. They continue by describing how an expansion in Kea numbers
appears to have coincided with settlement of the high country. But soon
Keas had earned a reputation as sheep killers. Thousands were killed.
In Chapter 3 they describe the social behaviours of birds which they
studied. These are illustrated with delightful line drawings (this description
does not do them justice) of different aspects, such as play behaviour, and a
male feeding a fledgling. (There is no colour in this book - only black and
white photographs and drawings.) Mark Marcuson's drawings are simply
outstanding. They include some which show bill shapes of male and female,
and 'facial expressions' (in fact, the way the head feathers are erected) to
demonstrate aggression, defensiveness, submissiveness, etc.
The chapter on growing and learning describes the role of young birds
in Kea society. In another chapter, aspects of behaviour and ecology are
compared with those of the other member of the genus, the Kaka. In the
sixth and final chapter the authors describe contacts between Keas and people.
These are not just damaging to human property but often result in Keas
risking or losing their lives.
The book seems to end abruptly at page 150 (pages 151-230 consist of
appendices, notes and the index). As far as it goes it is excellent - but there
are so many other aspects which could have been explored. The species'
breeding biology is hardly mentioned. Here avicultural experience could
have been drawn upon. For example, those who have worked with Keas for
so many years at Paradise Park would have been an invaluable source of
information.

The Ecotravellers' Wildlife Guide to Tropical Mexico by Les Beletsky,
is similar in format to the same author's wildlife guide to Costa Rica,
reviewed recently by Dave Coles (Avicultural Magazine 104, 4: 182-183).
Endorsed by the Wildlife Conservation Society (founded in 1895 as the
New York Zoological Society), The Ecotravellers'Wildlife Guide to Tropical
Mexico (the Cancun region, Yucatan Peninsula, Oaxaca, Chiapas and
Tabasco) is, like the previous title, much more than just a simple wildlife
guide. The opening chapter is titled Ecotourism: Travel for the
Environmentally Concerned. Other chapters cover a range of topics including
Habitats (there is also a separate section with 21 colour photos illustrating
various habitats, etc.), Parks, Reserves, Getting Around, Environmental
Threats and Conservation.
Chapters 6-10, the bulk of this 498 page paperback guide, cover
Amphibians, Reptiles, Birds, Mammals and Coral Reef Wildlife, in the latter
instance, written by Richard Francis. There are 104 colour plates, of which
plates 20-69, by David Beadle, illustrate a wide cross section of bird species,
a number of which are known in aviculture.
The guide ends with an account of WCS Conservation Work in Latin
America and a form with which to make a membership contribution to the
WCS.
The Ecotravellers ' Wildlife Guide to Tropical Mexico (ISSN: 0-12-
084812-0) is published by Academic Press, 525 B Street, Suite 1900, San
Diego, California 92101-4495, USA. It is priced #19.95 in the UK, $27.95
in the USA and $38.95 in Canada.

Birds Australia is developing a policy on the trade and harvesting of
wild birds and welcomes ideas on this controversial issue. These should be
sent to the In Tray column of Wingspan , the quarterly journal of Birds
Australia, formerly the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union, 415
Riversdale Road, Hawthorn East, Victoria 3123, Australia (E-mail:
wingspan@raou.com.au).
Writing about the international bird trade in the latest issue (Vol.9, No.3),
Stephen Garnett concluded that, to his surprise, there seems to be a reasonable
case for a regulated trade in uncommon species. Adding, any such trade
would, of course, have to be part of a broader programme that includes
adequate understanding of the species in the wild, monitoring, genetic
fingerprinting and enforcement. Stephen believes: 'trade integrated with
conservation, that harnesses the enthusiasm, energy and considerable finances
of aviculture, and managed in a manner that puts resources back into
conservation particularly for countries with no other source of conservation
income, could provide more benefits than an ineffective blanket ban that
promotes cruelty, environmental vandalism and an unnecessary division
between responsible aviculture and those that strive to save wild populations.

Up to 100 Red-billed Oxpeckers Buphagus erythrorhynchus are to be
caught in the Kruger National Park and released in the Queenstown area of
Eastern Cape Province, in the hope that their liking for eating ticks will help
local farmers cut the costs of dipping and other pest control measures. Others
have been introduced recently into some Eastern Cape game reserves. The
Red-billed Oxpecker became extinct in the province in the 1980s due,
according to a report quoted in the latest Newsletter of BirdLife South Africa,
Vol.2, No.3, to the misuse of poisons and pest control substances. The return
of the oxpeckers to Queenstown is said to be especially significant in that it
will be the first time these birds have been returned to a farming area in the
province.

Compiling records of Wild Birds Bred in Captivity in the Eastern United
States , Beebe and Crandall (1909) were aware of only four taxa of parrots
reproduced at that time. The first breedings of the Cockatiel Nymphicus
hollandicus and Black-cheeked Lovebird Agapornis nigrigenis (misattributed
as the Masked Lovebird A. personata ) were achieved by private aviculturists.
The Budgerigar Melopsittacus undulatus is credited to the New York
Zoological Park. The final species was the Carolina Parrakeet Conuropsis
carolinensis, for which Beebe and Crandall (1909) provide the record of
'one bird... hatched from an egg which had been placed under a Turtle Dove'
on September 9th, 1885 at the Philadelphia Zoological Garden.
While the Carolina Parrakeet was bred repeatedly in Germany as early
as 1881 (Hopkinson, 1926; Kolar, 1972), I am aware of only two other North
American facilities breeding this species. The Smithsonian ornithologist,
Robert Ridgeway maintained a pair, collected in Florida in 1896, in his
house. Several young were hatched of which one, produced in 1902, and
partly hand-raised due to parental neglect, died in the possession of the
malacologist, Paul Bartsch in 1914 (Bartsch, 1957; Peterson, 1957).
The Cincinnati Zoo purchased 16, collected in Florida in 1886 (Fuller,
1987; Ehrlinger, 1993). Ehrlinger (1993) records that 'a number... were
hatched and raised... Generally, however, the birds were inattentive parents
and often tossed their eggs out of their nests'. By 1917 only a single pair of
Cincinnati's birds (both from the original shipment) was still alive. The
female died late that year. The male, the last in captivity, died on February
21st, 1918. A pair from the 1886 group was given to the New York Zoological
Park in 1911, but both were dead in less than two years (Bridges, 1974).
When Crandall (1927) produced a second revision of the 1909 list, there
was only a single parrot species to add to the original four: the Peach-faced
Lovebird A. roseicollis , credited to the New York Zoological Park. By that
time there were a number of comprehensive parrot collections in zoos in the
USA, but reproduction was almost non-existent. In its first 40 years, from

1888 through 1928, the National Zoological Park obtained 104 taxa of parrots
(Mann, 1930a), yet total parrot breeding results for this period amounted to
only five Budgerigars (Mann, 1930b).

Crandall (1930) was able to add a further 11 species of parrots in his
final revision of Records of Birds Bred in Captivity in the United States. All
had been hatched from 1926 through 1929. Ten of these first breedings in
the USA were the achievements of private aviculturists. The record for
Swainson's Lorikeet Trichoglossus haematodus moluccanus was credited
to the San Diego Zoo.
Founded with exhibits remaining from the 1916 Panama Pacific
Exposition, and relocated to its present site in 1922, the San Diego Zoological
Garden had, by the late 1920s, attained the status it has held ever since as
having one of the world's leading parrot collections. Through 1929, 60 taxa
were obtained (Dolan and Moran, 1970). In 1925 and 1927, exchange
shipments arrived from Australian zoos. A collection of lories and lorikeets
was received from the Surabaya Zoo in 1929. Various species were presented
by military personnel in Central America. Belle Benchley (1930a), Executive
Secretary of the Zoological Society of San Diego, wrote: The bird collection
at the zoological garden, more particularly the parrot group, is now so large
that it has been decided to center our efforts upon adding only the very rare,
or the especially beautiful or spectacular, to this group'.
Through 1930, 14 species were hatched at the San Diego Zoo (Dolan
and Moran, 1970). While many of the records for this period and the early
1930s appear to have been lost, there exists very interesting documentation.
Belle Benchley, Director of the San Diego Zoo from 1941 through 1953, is
best remembered for her work with primates. However, I was informed by
K.C. Lint (Curator of Birds from 1946 through 1976) that she was a highly
competent aviculturist, personally caring for many of the birds during the
Second World War.
From 1929 through 1932 she contributed a number of notes and articles
to Aviculture , the journal of the Avicultural Society of America. These
included detailed discussions of the breeding of Edward's Lorikeet T.h.
capistratus in 1931 (Benchley 1932c), Red-sided Eclectus Eclectus roratus
polychloros in 1929 (Benchley 1929a&amp;b, 1930a) and Blue-winged Grass
Parrakeet Neophema chrysostoma in 1930 (Benchley, 1930b), as well as, in
1931 hybrids between the now severely endangered Red and Blue Lory Eos
h. histrio and Eastern Violet-necked Lory E.s. squamata (Benchley
1932a&amp;b). Accounts of two unsuccessful nestings of the Purple-crowned
Lorikeet Glossopsitta porphyrocephala in 1930 and 1931 (Benchley 1930b,
1932a), where in both cases eggs were eaten near hatching, are most

interesting. These are apparently the only Western Hemisphere breeding
attempts for this species on record; they were alluded to by Rosemary Low
(1977) who was aware of no details.
Of particular interest in these Aviculture articles are statements of
collection policy at that time. Regarding the Eos hybrid, Mrs Benchley
(1932a) wrote: 'The San Diego Zoo does not exhibit hybrid species nor
freaks of any kind. We will probably send it, therefore, to some one of the
aviculturists who is interested in carrying out such experiments'. (The only
parrot specifically noted by Delacour (1937) in his discussion of a 1936
visit to San Diego was 'a hybrid E. histrio x E. bornea &amp;apos;.
Prior to eventual success with this species, Benchley (1929b) noted '...the
failure of our Blue-wing Grass Parrots to make any serious attempt to breed.
These latter have been in the garden now for two years and they will be sent
to Dr Patrick, who has been doing such interesting things with some of the
rare parrots in the breeding way. In a large public collection the chances for
breeding are less and the time of the bird man has to be devoted to a large
extent to the routine cleaning and caring for the collection. Primarily, the
object of a zoological garden is to maintain a comprehensive and interesting
exhibit from the standpoint of public interest. Few visitors truly appreciate
the rarity of a Blue-wing Grass Parrot and find the Red-rump or Chattering
Lory in the adjoining cages much handsomer and more fascinating. On the
other hand, those directly responsible for the development and maintenance
of the zoo could not keep their interest at the necessary standard nor their
zeal sufficiently intense to offset the drudgery of the hard work if it were not
for the opportunity offered in such a sphere to contribute towards the scientific
knowledge of the world and to do their share towards the preservation of the
disappearing species'.
As it happened, only one of the two pairs of Blue-winged Grass Parrakeets
imported in 1927 was sent to Dr Leon Patrick in 1929 (Benchley, 1930b).
Dr Patrick, of Orange, California, was one of the pioneers in what was to
become the widespread propagation of Australian parrots in southern
California. Prestwich (1930) cited Dr Patrick as '... the first American to
make a serious attempt to save some of the fast disappearing species of
Australian parrakeets (sic), and it is mainly through his untiring efforts that
others have become interested; and what was considered a doubtful
experiment three years ago now gives promise of success. In 1928 he
successfully bred and brought to maturity one of the most difficult species -
the Pileated Parrakeet Purpureicephalus spurius - as well as some Blue-
winged Grass Parrakeets'. Throughout its history the San Diego Zoo has
continued to maintain a close relationship with private aviculturists.
Belle Benchley (1932a) observed: 'We have been unusually busy this
year due to doubling up on work and sometimes I wonder that we have done

as well as we have. We have about 68 species of the parrot family in almost
as many cages. As our cages are large, it means a lot of work just taking
care of that part mechanically without the fussing necessary for little birds'.
The year 1932 nearly proved disastrous. In August, the San Diego County
Tax Assessor attempted to auction off the holdings of the Zoological Society,
including all animals, to collect $6,358 in back taxes. The auction was
thwarted by local police officers who announced that the 200 potential bidders
would be prohibited from removing animals from the premises (Morgan,
1990). Despite general depression conditions, the resulting public outcry
led to an unambiguous tax-exempt status for the society and in 1934 a
property tax levy of two cents per every hundred dollars. That year the
zoo's holdings included 11 taxa of lories and lorikeets, 10 of cockatoos and
eight of conures among the extensive parrot collection (Benchley, 1934).
By March 1st, 1951, 140 parrot taxa had been maintained at one time or
another at San Diego and 69 were present at that date (Stott, 1951). Ken
Stott Jr. (1951) then General Curator, listed 35 taxa of parrots hatched to
that point, as well as five hybrids. Two species stand out in this list for
sustained propagation. Leadbeater's Cockatoo Cacatua /. leadbeateri
commenced breeding in 1935, and roughly 30 were reared to maturity by
1951 when three generations were represented in the collection. A single
pair of Southern Bare-eyed Cockatoo C.s. sanguined, which produced its
first chick in 1929, had hatched 'approximately 50' by 1951. Dolan and
Moran (1970) document hatchings every year from 1933 through 1953,
which produced at least 44, as well as 12 hatched from 1955 through 1960,
again without missing a year, and single specimens hatched in 1964 and
1966.
By the end of 1968 the historical total of parrot taxa hatched at San
Diego Zoo had grown to 69. As of December 31st, 1968 176 taxa of parrots
were present (Dolan and Moran, 1970), while the total number of bird taxa
at the zoo was 1,076. The year-end total for bird taxa peaked on December
31st, 1969 with 1,126 (represented by 3,465 specimens). The total number
of birds raised to maturity in 1970 (as reported to the International Zoo
Yearbook) was 101 of 34 taxa (Lindholm, 1993). Eighty-three of these birds
were parrots, representing 25 taxa, all Old World. Of these, 29 were lories
or lorikeets, representing 10 taxa.
For several years in the early 1970s, roughly 200 taxa of parrots were
held at the San Diego Zoo and parrots - especially lories and lorikeets,
Australian endemics, and Psittacula species - continued to predominate in
the annual tallies of birds bred. As will be discussed later, this situation
would be altered by the mid-1980s.

Prior to the 1960s, only one other 'mainstream' zoo in the USA
accomplished a significant record of parrot breeding. Opened to the public
in 1934, the Chicago Zoological Park (always known more popularly as the
Brookfield Zoo) acquired that year 'the greater part of the collection of the
Taronga Zoological Park in Sydney... shipped in one huge boat-load' (Plath,
1935). Purchased for $11,000, the shipment consisted of 98 mammals, 746
birds and 32 reptiles (Ross, 1997). The Australian specimens made up the
greater part of Brookfield's bird collection for some years.
The psittacosis scare then being widespread, special arrangements were
made to quarantine the Australian parrots at Brookfield with the result that
the Perching Bird House and the Parrot House were not opened to the public
until early 1935. The latter structure was unique in American zoos. While
San Diego maintained extensive series of outdoor parrot exhibits, and a
number of other zoos' bird houses (most notably Seattle's built in the post-
war 1940s) (Hill, 1953) included separate parrot halls, only the Chicago
Zoological Park constructed a building with indoor exhibits devoted entirely
to parrots.
At its opening the Parrot House held 41 taxa of parrots distributed among
35 aviaries. All but 12 were Australian (Plath, 1935). With individuals
scattered among other locations in the zoo, the total number of parrot
specimens was 259. By 1937 the total number of aviaries in the Parrot
House had been reduced, by amalgamation, to 23. The number of taxa had
grown to 52 (Plath, 1937). Up to this time no successful reproductions had
occurred, although eggs had been laid by Swainson's Lorikeets, Black Lories
Chalcopsitta a. atra and Bourke's Parrakeets N. bourkii.
Karl Plath, Brookfield Zoo's Curator of Birds from 1935 through 1961,
had long before his appointment been one of America's leading private
aviculturists (Prestwich, 1930). A Chicago draper, he had by 1929 achieved
the first breedings in the USA of Nyasa Lovebird A. lilianae and Green-
ramped Parrotlet Forpus passerinus (Crandall, 1930).
In 1938, a long-planned series of off-exhibit outdoor breeding runs was
constructed and stocked on June 5th of that year. Plath (1939) provides a
summary of that first breeding season: seven species, all Australian, were
hatched. The highlight was the first breeding in the USA of the Princess
Parrot Polytelis alexandrae (from a pair which arrived in Chicago on July
14th, 1938 - one of three pairs which marked the species' first importation
into North America). By 1950 the original 12 runs had been increased to 23
and an additional large Australian shipment had arrived in 1949. Plath (1950)
listed 29 pairs representing 20 species, as well as two hybrid pairs, which he
set up for that season. At this time Brookfield maintained 53 taxa of parrots.
Plath (1951) enumerated all parrots fully reared there from 1938 through
mid-1951.

Aside from 109 Budgerigars, there were 175 specimens representing 13
taxa. Outstanding among these records were 36 Australian King Parrots
Alisterus scapularis, 35 Swainson's Lorikeets, 27 Princess Parrots, 21
Bourke's Parrakeets and 18 Crimson-winged Parrots Aprosmictus
erythropterus. In addition, an indoor exhibit aviary in the Parrot House was
the site of the first captive breeding of Goldie's Lorikeet I goldiei in 1951.
In 1959, Brookfield's off-exhibit parrot breeding facility was demolished
to make way for the Seven Seas Dolphinarium. Small (1970) lists all parrot
breeding at the zoo up to that point. By 1959 49 Swainson's Lorikeets had
been raised, together with 28 Princess Parrots and 26 Crimson-winged
Parrots. In the Parrot House the number of Goldie's Lorikeets raised had
risen to 11. The total number of parrot taxa raised from 1938 through 1959
totalled 19 (Small, 1970).
Small (1970) gives a detailed account of the breeding programme which
commenced on public display in the Parrot House following the loss of the
off-exhibit runs. From 1962 through 1969, 135 parrots of 10 taxa (plus two
hybrids) were raised. Chief among these were 65 Nyasa Lovebirds (48 had
been raised in the off-exhibit runs from 1951 through 1959). Other significant
Parrot House rearings included a further 19 Swainson's Lorikeets, 13 Hawk-
headed Parrots Deroptyus accipitrinus and 11 hybrid Scarlet Ara macao x
Blue and Gold Macaws A. ararauna (one of which was hand-raised from
the egg).
In 1970 the Parrot House was converted to studio space for the zoo's
Design Department (Ross, 1997). Some of the inhabitants were
accommodated in the Perching Bird House and other exhibits, but the greater
portion of the parrot collection was dispersed. A pair of Hyacinth Macaws
Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus , which had hatched a chick that lived only
two days in 1969, was sold to Ralph Small, Parrot House keeper since 1961.
The first fully successful breeding of this species took place in his basement
in 1971 (Prestwich, 1971; Low, 1980). This was followed by five more
through 1973 (Low, 1980). The first successful zoo breeding in the USA
did not occur until 1975 (Brookfield's unsuccessful 1969 breeding was not
reported to the International Zoo Yearbook ).
A male Lear's Macaw A. leari, estimated to have hatched in 1946, was
loaned to the San Diego Zoo in 1970 where it died in 1978 (W. Schulenburg
pers. comm.). The female with which it had been paired, property of the
Los Angeles Zoo, was eventually sent to Busch Gardens, Tampa.
A St Vincent Amazon Amazona guildingii , loaned to the Houston Zoo,
died there some time before 1972 in 'an abortive attempt to sex it by cloacal
examination' (Berry, 1981).
Brookfield's role as a major breeder was thus ended, although a number
of species continued to breed - most notably Nyasa Lovebirds of which 108

hatched and 101 were reared from 1970 through 1987, according to
International Zoo Yearbook submissions.
Parrot Jungle and Catalina Bird Park
Two privately owned tourist facilities achieved noteworthy parrot
breedings before the 1950s.
Opened in 1936, Parrot Jungle in south Miami, Florida has been one of
the least documented bird collections open to the public in the USA. Since
Volume 35 of the International Zoo Yearbook there have been no submissions
to its breeding records or directory of institutions. Since 1991, endangered
and threatened taxa have been listed by ISIS.
The park was established by Austrian-born Franz Scherr with 25 macaws
purchased from a Laredo (Texas) dealer. As of 1992, a Military Macaw
A.militaris from this consignment was still alive (Clubb and Clubb, 1992).
From the beginning a number of macaws were at liberty, conditioned to
return to a night house. Birds which formed pairs could be confined in
compartments in this facility. The system has been described in detail (Low,
1980; Clubb and Clubb, 1992). Breeding commenced in 1940 with the
hatching of hybrid Scarlet x Blue and Gold Macaws. Through 1991, at least
257 macaws were hatched at Parrot Jungle from a total of 52 founders (Clubb
and Clubb, 1992). While many were hybrids between Scarlet and Blue and
Gold, Military or Buffon's Macaws A. ambigua , a number of pure Scarlet
and Blue and Gold Macaws were also reared. Five generations of Scarlet
and hybrid macaws have been produced.
Hybrids between Scarlet and Blue and Gold Macaws are popularly
known, at least to American aviculturists, as Catalina Macaws, in homage
to the otherwise largely forgotten Catalina Bird Park on Santa Catalina Island
off the coast of California, near Los Angeles. This collection was sold in its
entirety to the newly relocated Los Angeles Zoo in 1966.
One of the few published accounts of the collection is that of Jean
Delacour (1937) from which the following is extracted: 'Catalina Island
is... the property of the Wrigley family (of chewing gum fame) who have
developed it into a pleasure resort. The late Mr Wrigley, who was a keen
bird fancier, combined his tastes with his interests, and created the bird park
both for his amusement and as an attraction to visitors. Since his death it
has been maintained mostly for the second reason... It is a walled-in
enclosure, with a large and high round-shaped flying cage in front and several
paths with rows of aviaries. At the back there is roomy breeding
accommodation. The collection of birds is large and general, and contains
very good things. There are... a large number of parrots and many small
birds, including birds of paradise. Many birds breed, and I noticed some
curious hybrids: two beautiful macaws (Blue and Yellow x Red and Blue), a

than either parent, some lories Eos bornea x Trichoglossus moluccanus,
and Mikado x Swinhoe's Pheasants...&amp;apos;. The first hybrid macaws hatched at
Catalina Bird Park in 1931 (Low, 1980).
Busch Gardens
It is interesting to note that while the Catalina Bird Park grew through
the interests of the chewing gum manufacturer, William Wrigley, the bird
gardens established by a brewer, the late August A. Busch Jr., President and
Chairman of Anheuser-Busch Inc from 1946 to 1975, evolved into a major
animal collection here in the USA.
In 1959 when a Busch brewery was built in Tampa, Florida, a series of
aviaries was established adjacent to that building. Busch Gardens was
initially free to the public. Over the next decade a mammal collection was
also developed there. By the end of 1970 the park had expanded to nearly
300 acres (approx. 121 hectares), of which the original bird gardens and
brewery comprised only a small corner.
By December 1970 there were 722 mammals of 121 species and 1,841
birds of 372 species (Lucas and Duplaix-Hall, 1972). The park had become
a major Florida tourist attraction with a commensurate admission charge.
By the late 1990s Busch Entertainment Corporation had acquired the four
Seaworld Parks as well as a number of other facilities in various states,
becoming the 'second largest theme park owner-operator in the world, right
behind the Walt Disney Company' (Anon. 1994). It should be noted that in
the mid-1990s the Tampa Brewery, now closed, continued to produce nearly
three million barrels of Budweiser lager annually (Anon. 1994).
In the midst of all this, Busch Gardens has produced an outstanding
number of parrots. The parrot collection began with a large shipment of
Australian species procured from August Busch's friend, Roland Lindemann,
President and Founder of the Catskill Game Farm (Marvin Jones pers.
comm.). At that time, commercial export of Australian birds was still
permitted. Busch Gardens contributions to the International Zoo Yearbook&amp;apos;s
breeding records commence in 1963. Through 1994, there were only four
years (1969, 1982, 1986 and 1988) when records were not received. The
IZY listing for Busch Gardens has always been simply 'Tampa USA'. The
municipally-owned Lowry Park Zoo, obscure until the 1980s, is listed as
'Tampa LP'. During the 1970s, Busch Gardens were operated in Van Nuys,
California and Houston, Texas but were eventually closed, the California
facility to make room for a brewery expansion. Over the years covered
through Volume 37 of the IZY , the breeding of 105 taxa was recorded, a
Western Hemisphere record exceeded only by the San Diego Zoo (Table 2).
Most of this propagation took place in an extensive off-exhibit facility

hatched in 1994) and 51 Green-winged Macaws Ara chloroptera) (Table 3),
was motivated in part by the desire to saturate private aviculture with captive-
bred birds, thus reducing the demand for imported specimens. Michael
Wells, Busch Gardens' Curator of Birds, informed me that many of these
were acquired directly by breeders, becoming a major component of the
North American captive population. Of particular interest over this period
is the full rearing of 151 endangered Golden Conures A. guarouba and 135
vulnerable Golden-capped Conures A. auricapilla.
Since the passage of the 1992 Wild Bird Conservation Act ended the
commercial importation of parrots into the USA in 1993, Busch Gardens
has greatly reduced its parrot breeding efforts. The large off-exhibit breeding
facility has been discontinued.
As of mid-1998, the parrot collection consisted of 60 taxa. Among
institutions open to the public in the USA, this number was exceeded only
by Parrot Jungle with roughly 70 taxa. The ISIS Bird Abstract for December
31st, 1997 lists six taxa hatched at Busch Gardens that year: one Forsten's
Lorikeet T.h. forsteni, three Scarlet Macaws, two Red-cheeked Macaws A.
rubrogenys, 10 Golden Conures, one Green-thighed Caique Pionites /.
leucogaster and one Blue-fronted Amazon Amazona aestiva.
1959 - 1972
From data collected by the editors of the International Zoo Yearbook , it
can be seen that the 1960s saw a dramatic and steady growth in parrot
breeding in zoos in the USA (Table I). Aside from the aforementioned
institutions, few American public collections did much of significance in
the 1950s. There is very little documentation. An exception is the Tracy
Aviary in Salt Lake City, Utah. Opened in 1939, this municipally operated
collection had, by the 1940s, assembled a 'particularly interesting' collection
of parrots (Delacour, 1947). When the captive reproduction of Leadbeater's
Cockatoos was still an unusual occurrence, an account of Tracy Aviary's
initial success with this species was published (Wilson, 1952). One of the
very few public collections devoted to birds (Lindholm, 1990), Tracy Aviary
ranks among the top nine institutions in the USA submitting records to the
IZY for the number of taxa bred, with a total of 20 (Table 2).
Four zoos in the USA reported parrot breedings to the International Zoo
Yearbook for its inaugural volume for 1959. A total of 20 species was bred,
mostly by San Diego Zoo. From 1959 through 1968, 35 collections reported
breedings with a total of 78 taxa listed (Table I). Until 1966, the number of
reporting institutions never exceeded nine but that year it rose to 13 - a

figure below which it has never dropped since. The number of taxa produced
each year remained below 40 until 1969 when 49 were hatched (33 being
recorded for 1968). Only once, when 48 taxa were reported for 1972, have
there been fewer than 52 taxa bred in any subsequent year (Table I).
There are a number of clearly identifiable contributing factors to the
increase in zoo propagation in the USA in the 1960s. In 1959, Australia
prohibited the commercial export of birds. While zoos were allowed to
receive captive-bred specimens under special permit, this was a complicated
process. On the other hand private aviculturists, especially in California,
made serious efforts to establish Australian species as self-sustaining
populations, becoming quite successful with some of the grass parrakeets
and rosellas. At any rate, between the overall decreased availability of
Australian parrots and the increased production of some species in the private
sector, a variety of Australian endemics were bred in zoos in the USA during
the 1960s.
Another influence was the change in Indonesian export policies following
the overthrow of the Sukarno government in 1965. Prior to this, export of
wildlife appears to have been strictly regulated. For example, San Diego
Zoo was allowed to import only two pairs of Rothschild's Mynahs Leucopsar
rothschildi under special permit in 1961 (Lint et al. 1990; Lindholm ,1996).
However, by the end of the decade hundreds of these birds were being
exported each year. Apparently, the infamous President Sukarno held a
personal aversion to the animal trade (Ryhiner and Mannix, 1958). In the
mid and late 1960s, large numbers of Lesser Sunda and Moluccan parrots
entered the international market and a number of these were bred in American
zoos at this time (Table 3).
Although Brazil prohibited bird exports after 1967, South American
imports in general, as well as those from India and Thailand, were arriving
in the USA at peak levels in the 1960s, resulting in such species as the
Nanday Conure Nandayus nenday and various Psittacula parrakeets being
bred in American zoos during this period.
There were some efforts towards breeding endangered taxa. San Diego
achieved the first captive breeding of Thick-billed Parrot Rhynchopsitta
pachyrhyncha in 1965 (Lint, 1966), an event greeted with much fanfare
including an Edward H. Bean award from the American Zoo and Aquarium
Association. This success was very shortly followed by Los Angeles Zoo
and the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum. San Diego bred the Scarlet-chested

3 it can be seen that many species hatched in the 1960s were produced only
sporadically. Parrot exhibits in zoos in the USA often tended towards multi-
species displays containing whatever birds the opportunity might present.
At a time when enormous numbers of Asian and Neotropical birds arrived
in the USA in continuous importations, there was little impetus for zoos to
make any serious attempt to breed parrots.
This situation was suddenly altered in 1972 when, in response to
outbreaks of Newcastle disease in 1971, the United States Government
imposed a year-long moratorium on bird imports followed by strict quarantine
requirements for all subsequent importations. The resulting dramatic increase
in bird prices had a profound effect on private and zoo aviculture.
1973 - 1993
From 1959 through 1972, 51 zoos in the USA reported breeding a total
of 110 taxa of parrots (Table I). From 1973 through 1994, a further 71
institutions reported breedings to the IZY and 93 additional parrot taxa were
recorded. In 1972, 24 institutions reported parrot breedings with 48 taxa
recorded. In 1973, the number of institutions fell to 17 but 55 taxa were
produced. In 1974, the number of reporting Institutions again stood at 24.
Over the next two decades this number fairly steadily increased to double.
On the other hand, the annual total of taxa has been more erratic (Table I).
While the 1970s saw the closing of the Indian and Thai commercial bird
trades, continuing expansion of the Indonesian market significantly affected
American zoo collections. Prior to the late 1970s, many New Guinea parrots
were available only through special export from Papua New Guinea. For
some years the only Pesquet's Parrots Psittrichas fulgidus, Stella's Lorikeet
Charmosyna papou goliathina and fig parrots in North America were at
San Diego, exported from Papua through the efforts of Sir Edward Hallstrom.
The arrival of these and other taxa as commercial importations from Irian
Jaya, commencing In 1978, was unexpected. The effect on American zoo
parrot breeding was soon apparent. In 1979 alone, the first hatchings of
Duivenbode's Lory C. duivenbodei, Stella's Lorikeet and Pesquet's Parrot
took place, all followed by a number of further successes (Table 3).
Just before Goldie's Lorikeets became commercially available, San Diego
Zoo received a pair in 1976, with a shipment of birds of paradise from the
Baiyer River Sanctuary in Papua, through the special arrangements of K. C.
Lint. This pair produced a chick in 1978 (Low, 1980), the first in the USA
since the last had hatched at Brookfield (from parents obtained from Sir
Edward Halstrom) before 1959. It is startling to note that this species became
the second most abundantly produced lory or lorikeet (after Swainson's
Lorikeet) in the 1959-94 IZY listings (Table 3). Unlike a number of other
Indonesian imports, it continues to flourish in zoos in the USA. ISIS reports

that in 1997, 18 hatched at San Diego Zoo, and one at Kansas City. At the
same time, this species has gone from being non-existent in American private
aviculture in 1977, to being considered a 'beginner's' lorikeet. While the
Green-naped Lorikeet T. h. haematodus was bred in zoos here as early as
1975 (Table 3), perhaps from Moluccan specimens, it was a rare bird in the
USA until the Irian Jaya shipments became frequent at the end of the 1970s.
By the late 1980s this taxa was a standard pet store bird, as well as
becoming a mainstay of the public feeding enclosures for lorikeets which
came into vogue in American zoos in the 1980s. From having a
comparatively short zoo history in the USA, it has been a particularly prolific
race of T. haematodus , and has eclipsed all others at present. ISIS reports
that in 1997 a total of 12 was produced between Mesker Park Zoo, in
Evansville, San Antonio Zoo, Tracy Aviary and Reid Park Zoo, in Tucson.
Otherwise, only single specimens of T. h. forsteni and I h. ruhritorquis
were hatched at Busch Gardens and San Diego Zoo, respectively, while two
T. h. moluccanus were hatched at the Roger Williams Park Zoo in Providence.
At the same time a great range of parrots from elsewhere in Indonesia
were imported into the USA in large quantities. The exploitation of such
species as Black-winged Lory E. cyanogenia, Blue-streaked Lory E.
reticulata and Goffin's Cockatoo C. goffini, Umbrella Cockatoo C. alba,
Salmon-crested Cockatoo C. moluccensis and Lesser Sulphur-crested
Cockatoo C. sulphurea , resulted in great concern for the status of these
species, none of which had been considered in jeopardy before the 1970s.
The Salmon-crested Cockatoo, in particular, experienced so precipitous a
decline that in 1988 the Fauna Preservation Society declared it one of the 10
animals and plants in greatest danger of extinction.
This led to its placement on Appendix I of CITES, thus prohibiting
commercial trade. Up to when this ban went into effect in late 1989,
thousands continued to be trapped annually, and large shipments entered
American importers' stations until that date. Most of these birds were
acquired by private breeders. While it seems anomalous that, as of 1998,
captive-bred Salmon-crested Cockatoos were routinely offered on breeder's
price lists at significantly lower prices than Galahs Eolophus roseicapillus
and a fraction of the price of the traditionally more easily bred Leadbeater's
Cockatoo, this is hopefully indicative of healthy current levels of captive
breeding. Rosemary Low (1997), however, warns 'the Moluccan Cockatoo
is an example of a species which will die out in aviculture in the USA if
breeders persist in hand-rearing all the young. Breeding successes with
hand-reared males are almost non-existent'. While ISIS indicates that 119
specimens were distributed among 52 zoos in the USA at the end of 1997,
no breedings appear to have taken place that year. On the other hand, over
the 37 years covered by the /ZTbreeding records (Table 3), the 77 Salmon-

crested Cockatoos hatched (with 51 surviving), make it the third most prolific
Cockatoo (after the Galah and Leadbeater's Cockatoo) in zoos in the USA,
while the number of participating collections (14) ranks only behind the 20
for the Galah.
At the same time that this exploitation of Indonesian parrots was
proceeding at full blast, similarly disturbing developments took place in
South America. Although several countries, most notably Brazil, in 1967,
had prohibited the commercial export of birds, by the 1980s others began
large-scale exportation of species with little or no avicultural history. Two
Bolivian endemics appeared for the first time in the 1970s. The Blue-
throated or Caninde Macaw A. glaucogularis was an enigma, with no clear
understanding of its range or taxonomic status when Forshaw (1973)
published his monograph. By the late 1970s, living specimens had arrived
in both Europe and America. In 1981, it is estimated eleven per cent of the
wild population was collected for export (Low, 1984).
The Red-cheeked Macaw had long been 'one of the least known of all
South American parrots' (Forshaw, 1973). In 1973 the first captive specimens
were exported. By the early 1980s when the species began to appear in
American zoos, hundreds were exported annually, from a population
estimated at between 3,000 to 5,000 (Low, 1984).
Though certainly not a threatened or little-known species, the Sun Conure
was, for most of this century, an extreme avicultural rarity, despite being
one of the first New World parrots hatched in captivity in 1883 (Hopkinson,
1926). I know of none in American zoos prior to the 1970s. Commercial
imports from Guyana and Surinam began in that decade. Zoo breedings in
the USA commenced in 1975, when it was hatched in Denver, and have
continued every year since then. The 1,214 birds (of which only 126 failed
to survive) bred among 23 zoos from 1975 through 1994, make this the
most prolific parrot taxon in zoos in the USA, as recorded in Volumes 1-35
of the International Zoo Yearbook (Table 3). Only the Cockatiel, Peach-
faced Lovebird, Blue and Gold, and Scarlet Macaws were produced by more
zoos in the USA over this 36 year period. This explosive production has
had a definite effect on the zoo propagation of other parrots, especially New
World species. Formerly commonly-bred species such as Jandaya and
Nanday Conures, the Orange-fronted or 'Halfmoon' Conure A. canicularis
and Patagonian Conure Cyanoliseus patagonus all appear to have been
displaced by Sun Conures (Table 3).
It was only to be expected that such widespread commercial exploitation
of wild parrots would lead to legislative restrictions. In 1992, the United
States Government passed the Wild Bird Conservation Act which went into
effect a year later. This prohibited the commercial importation of all bird
taxa listed on any appendix of CITES, with the exception of 'gamebirds'.

As almost all parrots had been placed on CITES Appendix II (requiring
documentation of international shipments) in 1981, the commercial shipment
of wild-caught parrots to the USA effectively ended in 1993. Allowance
was made for special importation by zoos and breeding consortiums, but
the application process is lengthy, and arrangements for importation and
quarantine, without the infrastructure of the commercial importers can be
most complicated.
While the 1992 Wild Bird Conservation Act's prohibition of commercial
parrot shipments acted as another impetus towards zoo parrot breedings, at
the same time other factors had already facilitated such programmes. A
major innovation was the provision of various techniques for sexing
monomorphic birds. In the early 1980s, these were still in development,
but by the end of that decade surgical laparoscopy had become routine, and
such non-invasive procedures as the analysis of blood-feathers were widely
available.
In particular, this led to a dramatic increase in zoo macaw breedings.
From 1959 through 1968, only four collections in the USA reported hatchings
of Blue and Gold Macaws to the International Zoo Yearbook. No hatchings
occurred from 1960 through 1963. Of the 18 chicks hatched in that decade,
13 were produced at Busch Gardens. In this same period, Scarlet Macaws
were only bred in 1968, three being hatched at Busch Gardens. For the total
period 1959 through 1994, the IZY records 1,014 Blue and Gold Macaws
hatched among 47 zoos in the USA (Table 3), the largest number of
institutions recorded for any parrot. The total for Scarlet Macaws is 612
among 28 zoos, putting this species in second place among parrots for the
number of institutions breeding it. No Green-winged Macaws hatched in
zoos in the USA prior to 1979. From that year through 1994, 188 were
hatched among 16 zoos. Another result of the ability to determine the sex of
macaws was the cessation of production of hybrids in American zoos after
1985 (Table 3).
The increase in breedings of macaws - as well as cockatoos, eclectus,
Amazons and other species - in the 1980s coincided with a dramatic
expansion of private sector breedings, resulting in an American cottage
industry producing hand-raised pet birds. By the late 1980s this led to a
near saturation of the pet market which, in turn, resulted in a reduced
emphasis on parrot breeding by a number of zoos. Several that had achieved
consistent success in breeding parrots, such as Brownsville, Cincinnati, Fort
Worth, Houston, Fos Angeles and Oklahoma City (Table 2), have since
reduced their parrot collections and shifted their emphasis towards
propagating hornbills, owls or other birds less likely to be worked with by
private aviculturists.
Other institutions, while continuing to specialize in parrots, have refined

their collections. At the time the Newcastle disease importation ban went
into effect in 1972, there were approximately 200 taxa of parrots at the San
Diego Zoo. From 1976, when Arthur Risser succeeded K.C. Lint as Curator
of Birds, the encyclopedic 'stamp collection' aspect was de-emphasized.
Aviaries full of mixed species groups were phased out, with many surplus
species being transferred to breeding situations elsewhere. While there
remained a focus on lories and lorikeets, Neotropical species and cockatoos,
which had not bred for some years, were again the target of propagation.
As with other zoos, a new emphasis was placed on softbills in the late
1980s, especially following James Dolan's appointment as Collections
Director in 1986. As Assistant Curator of Birds in the 1960s he did much to
expand the parrot collection to its peak numbers, concentrating especially
on Pacific species. In the 1980s, however, exhibits of the more aviculturally
familiar taxa were replaced with extensive series of fruit pigeons, hornbills,
cotingas and laughing thrushes. At the same time, unusual parrot taxa
continued to be added and bred. As noted earlier, the total number of parrot
taxa bred at San Diego from the 1920s through 1968 came to 69 (Dolan and
Moran, 1970). Over the 36 years covered by International Zoo Yearbook
breeding records, 1984 was the only year the San Diego Zoo failed to submit
statistics. Considering the magnitude of the collection, it is not surprising
that occasional omissions should have occurred. The breeding of Green-
winged King Parrots Alisterus chloropterus callopterus in 1967 and 1968
(Dolan and Moran, 1970) does not appear in the IZY records. The total
number of parrot taxa reported to the IZY as having hatched at the San Diego
Zoo from 1959 through 1994 is 125 (Table 2), by far the largest for a
collection in the USA in that period. As of December 31st, 1997, ISIS
indicated 50 taxa of parrots at San Diego with 15 hatched that year, among
them 10 taxa of lories and lorikeets including a Purple-naped Lory Lorius
domicellus and 13 Blue-crowned Lories Vini australis, two Pesquet's Parrots
and six Cuban Amazons A. leucocephala.
Breeding Programmes for Threatened Parrots
The 1970s and '80s saw various attempts at establishing programmes
for parrot taxa of conservation concern. While the aforementioned loan of
Lear's Macaws from Brookfield and Los Angeles to San Diego in 1970 did
not result in breeding, the subsequent loan of a bird from Parrot Jungle to
Busch Gardens did produce the first captive-bred chicks (Low, 1984 and
Bish, 1985), although at present only female Lear's Macaws remain in the
USA at Busch Gardens. Co-operation between the Bronx, National,
Brookfield and Houston zoos led to the first captive breeding of the St.
Vincent Amazon A. guildingii in 1972 (Berry, 1981). While there have not
been further zoo successes through 1998, there exists an AZA Species

Survival Plan for this bird, actively concentrating on work with captive
specimens in St. Vincent and field research (Bruning, 1996). The San Diego
Zoo embarked on a breeding programme for the Tahiti Lory V. peruviana
with smuggled birds seized by the US Government in 1978 (Low, 1984).
Despite the production of an impressive number of birds (68 hatched
over a 13 year period from 1978 through 1995 (Table 3), the captive
population has remained small, ISIS listing nine specimens at San Diego
Zoo and one at the San Diego Wild Animal Park as of December 31st, 1997,
with none hatched that year. 'Salmonella, sarcocystis, a variety of bacterial
infections and incompatibility have all been challenges' (Schulenburg, 1997).
On the other hand the work undertaken with this species has led to the
Zoological Society of San Diego's involvement in a variety of projects
concerned with Vini lories in French Polynesia.
While the New York Zoological Society (now the Wildlife Conservation
Society) had not previously devoted major efforts to propagating parrots,
remarkable successes were achieved following the establishment of the
Wildlife Survival Centre on St. Catherine's Island, off the coast of Georgia,
in 1974.
The first parrots bred there were Leadbeater's Cockatoos in 1978. From
Table 3 it can be seen that the centre (listed by the International Zoo Yearbook
as 'NY Bronx SCWCC') had, far and away, led in US zoo production of
Leadbeater's Cockatoos, Pesquet's Parrots, Blue-throated and Red-cheeked
Macaws. In addition, significant work has been done there with Palm
Cockatoos Probosciger aterrimus and Yellow-shouldered Amazons A.
barbadensis.
A 1980's innovation was US administered studbooks for threatened
parrots. The confiscation by the US Fish and Wildlife Service of over 100
Palm Cockatoos in 1983 (Young, 1986) led to the formation of a zoo
consortium and resulting studbook. (US Government confiscations had a
pronounced effect on zoo parrot breeding. Many of the Eclectus produced
from the 1980s onward were descendents of seized birds and most of the
Australian endemics hatched at Los Angeles in this period were of similar
origins). A Palm Cockatoo AZA Species Survival Programme subsequently
developed.
Following imposition of the Newcastle disease ban and subsequent
quarantine, the bird collection at the Sacramento Zoo in California became
focused on parrot propagation, resulting in the zoo becoming a leading
institution in such efforts (Table 2). Four Thick-billed Parrots were acquired
in 1975 and breeding commenced in 1977. Over the period covered by
Volumes 1 - 35 of the IZY, Sacramento hatched 43, failing to raise only
three, over 13 years, making it the most successful propagator of this species
among the 11 collections in the USA listed as having hatched it (Table 3).

Susan Healy, long-time Bird Supervisor at Sacramento, began preparing
data for a regional studbook in 1984, publishing the first edition in 1988
(Healy, 1998), the same year that the American Zoo and Aquarium
Association approved a Species Survival Programme for Thick-bills. She
has been the SSP Co-ordinator ever since. Because this is the only extant
parrot species with a historical range in the continental USA, there has been
great interest both in preserving the remaining Mexican populations and
reintroducing it to former habitats in the USA, although involved attempts
at the latter have met with little success so far (Snyder et al 1994). Thus
this SSP is heavily involved in in situ projects (Healy, 1998).
The first edition of the Golden Conure regional studbook was published
in 1990 (Lieberman, 1993), while a regional one for Hyacinth Macaw
appeared that same year. Both are notable for their attempts to include
private aviculturists, As of April 8th, 1998, there existed AZA approved
studbooks for 12 species of parrots (Boyd, 1998). In addition to the
previously mentioned Species Survival Plans for Palm Cockatoo, Thick-
billed Parrot and St. Vincent Amazon, there is a newly established one for
the Red-browed Amazon A. rhodocorytha , a species held almost entirely in
private aviculture but managed through the Palm Beach Zoo. In addition,
an AZA-recognised Breeding Consortium was organised for the Cuban
Amazon following a government seizure of illegally imported birds (Boyd,
1998).

<bodyText confidence="0.994199166666667" page_id="56237919"  page_num="161" year="" vol="">
With such programmes established it was natural that when the American
Zoo and Aquarium Association instituted Taxon Advisory Groups in 1991,
an inaugural one was formed for parrots.
From its inception, the Parrot TAG has taken private aviculture very
much into consideration. 'Parrots represent a unique set of taxa that differ
fundamentally from other animals under AZA administration. Foremost,
they are found in greater numbers and diversity outside AZA collections,
yet have a very broad appeal for exhibits, research and conservation
perspectives for AZA member institutions. The disproportionate
representation of parrots in private hands imposes many management
considerations unique to this group. The TAG is taking a leadership role in
establishing methods to collaborate with private individuals and their
organisations. Additionally, the Parrot TAG has the opportunity to be
formative in scope by overseeing private/public co-operation in newly
managed programmes and in the development of many more such
programmes (Bruning, 1997),
The initial Chairman of the Parrot TAG was Alan Leiberman, Curator of
Birds at the San Diego Zoo. Following his move to Hawaii to direct the

Peregine Fund's Hawaii Endangered Species Programme, the Chair was
assumed by Dr Donald Bruning, Chairman of the Department of Ornithology,
the Wildlife Conservation Society/Bronx Zoo. At the AZA National
Conference in Seattle in 1995, Dr Bruning oversaw the formation of sub-
groups representing various taxonomic divisions. As of 1998, there are 11
sub-groups, each with its Chair and/or Vice-Chair, and a panel of advisors
drawn from both the zoo community and private aviculture (Bruning 1997).
February 13th-16th, 1997, 14 members of the TAG met at White Oak
Plantation in Florida to draft a North American Regional Collection Plan to
serve as a guideline for parrot aviculture in American zoos. The mission

statement of this plan is as follows (Bruning, 1997):
1) Promoting excellence in parrot husbandry and management
2) Creating links between the zoological avicultural and conservation
communities
3) Preserving and restoring parrots and their habitat
4) Studying parrot populations and biology
5) Educating people about parrots
6) Opposing trade in wild-caught parrots

The Regional Collection Plan recommendations for lories and lorikeets
include the designation of the Collared Lory Phigys solitarius as a candidate
for a Population Management Plan to ensure a zoo-based, self-sutaining
captive population. The Tahiti Lory was designated a Model Population for
research purposes to hopefully eventually develop into a PMP. The Blue-
crowned Lory and Iris Lorikeet Trichoglossus iris are presently species to
be phased-in to collections in the USA with the goal of creating PMPs. In
situ efforts were recommended for V. ultramarinus and V. kuhli.
Stable Population status (implying a less urgent status than that for PMP
species, with more reliance on private aviculture as a source for zoo
specimens) was recommended for the Red Lory Eos hornea. Blue-streaked
Lory, Chattering Lory Lorius garrulus, Purple-naped Lory and Dusky Lory
Pseudeosfuscata , although with provision that the two Lorius species might
be upgraded to PMP status. Educational/Display status was recommended
for Goldie's Lorikeet and all forms of Rainbow Lorikeets ( T. haematodus ),
on the understanding that zoos may procure specimens from private
aviculture and need not devote efforts to maintaining a zoo-based population.
All other species of lories and lorikeets were not recommended for
management, or suggested for display purposes only, pending further
discussion.
Seven taxa of Indonesian Cacatua are recommended for Population
Management Plans with an emphasis on parent-rearing. In situ efforts and
involvement in private aviculture programmes are also suggested. While
there are presently few Red-vented Cockatoos C. haematuropygia in zoos

in the USA, this critically endangered Philippine endemic is recommended
to be phased into a PMP with in situ programmes as well. Australian species
are largely de-emphasized. The Galah, which has been bred more often
than any other cockatoo in American zoos (Table 3), is recommended to be
phased out to make space for conservation-significant taxa. Of the Australian
members of Cacatua , only Leadbeater&amp;apos;s Cockatoo is recommended for
management, and that only at Stable Population level. The Gang Gang
Callocephalon fimbriatum and an undesignated taxon of Calyptorhynchus
are suggested as model populations to be maintained for study by a small
number of zoos. As part of the on-going Species Survival Plan for Palm
Cockatoos, an investigation of subspecies determination through DNA
analysis is urged, together with field work. For practical purposes, the Kea
Nestor notabilis is considered, in the Regional Collection Plan, under the
Cockatoo sub-group and is recommended as a Stable Population of 20 or 30
specimens to be held by about a dozen North American zoos (Rruning, 1997).
As can be seen from Table 3, there has been a long-standing problem
with Eclectus management in zoos in the USA with many collections of
breeding birds of undesignated or misidentified races. The Regional
Collection Plan recommends for Population Management Plans only clearly
identified specimens of the North Moluccan E. roratus vosmaeri and
Solomon Island E. r. solomonensis races.
Two genera which have no reproductive history in zoos here are
recommended for being phased-in as Model Populations: both the Great-
billed Tanygnathus megalorhynchus and Muller's Parrots T. sumatranus,
and an undesignated species of Racket-tailed Parrot Prioniturus spp.
Although three species of fig parrots have been bred in zoos in the USA
(Table 3), following their commercial availability from Indonesia
commencing in the late 1970s, since the passage of the Wild Bird
Conservation Act zoo stocks have declined to near-exctinction. Only a single
Edward's Fig Parrot Psittaculirostris edwardsii was hatched in an American
zoo in 1997, at San Diego. TAG proposals for fig parrots include the initiation
of a 'private sector studbook', in situ studies, the designation of Model
Population status for any species available to zoos, with an emphasis on
Edward's Fig Parrot. A special importation, under the provisions of the
Wild Bird Conservation Act, in conjunction with private aviculturists, is
advised.
Another parrot commercially available from Indonesian New Guinea,
which showed promise as a zoo-propagated species only to falter, is the
Pesquet's or Vulturine Parrot. Prior to its appearance in commercial
shipments in the late 1970s it had been represented in American aviculture
by a handful of birds obtained at various times by the San Diego and Bronx
Zoos. As can be seen from Table 3, four collections hatched this species

over an 11 -year period. There was much initial difficulty in rearing chicks
but eventual success was achieved with 27 specimens reared at that time.
However, no further hatchings occurred until San Diego again succeeded in
1997. There are plans to import both captive-bred and wild-caught currently
captive specimens. TAG recommendations include an internationally-
managed Population Management Plan for this threatened bird as well as in
situ work.
A model programme for about 30 specimens of a race of the Shining
Parrot Prosopeia tabuensis, to be phased-in, is also proposed. The TAG
also suggests model populations, with a studbook, for two races of Green-
winged King Parrot A. c. chloropterus and A. c. mozkowskii , as well as a
PMP for Amboina King Parrots A. amboinensis .
It is recommended that the remaining Australian King Parrots in zoos in
the USA be phased out. This is the case for most Australian endemics,
except where specimens (to be obtained from private aviculture) may be
needed for display in Australian-themed exhibits. At any rate, breeding
programmes are not encouraged. Exceptions are the Turquoisine and
Scarlet-chested Grass Parrakeets, for which stable zoo populations are
suggested, as there is concern that the populations in private aviculture are
becoming saturated with mutations. All three species of Polytelis are
recommended as stable populations for display. Finally, the Hooded
Parrakeet Psephotus chrysopterygius is suggested as a possible candidate
for a Population Management Plan, pending investigations as to the purity
of the existing population in the USA (Bruning, 1997).
While it is recommended that the Long-tailed Parrakeet Psittacula
longicauda, of which ISIS listed three specimens in two institutions in the
USA on December 31 st, 1997, be eventually phased-in as a model population,
the Derbyan Parrakeet P. derbiana is designated only for education and
display. Because of its usefulness in softbill communities, the Blue-crowned
Hanging Parrot Loriculus galgulus is recommended to be managed for
display purposes as a Population Management Plan, with a studbook, with
the zoo population to be held at 120. If a hanging parrot of greater
conservation concern should become available, then it might replace L.
galgulus.
A studbook is suggested for the Black-cheeked Lovebird Agapornis
nigrigenis designated for a PMP. Fischer's Lovebird A. fischeri , which
appears to have suffered recently from trapping for export, is recommended
for a Stable Population, but only if it can be determined that zoos hold
genetically pure stock (much of the aviary strains here being contaminated
with Masked Lovebird genes). A studbook is recommended for both Vasa
Parrots Coracopsis spp. On the other hand, zoos in the USA are urged not
to breed African Grey Parrots Psittacus erithacus , but to maintain them

only for display and education purposes, as there are large numbers bred
annually by private aviculturists.
The Hyacinth Macaw is recommended for a SSR Blue-throated and
Red-cheeked Macaws are suggested for immediate Population Management
Plan status, while Buffon's Macaw Ara ambigua, Yellow-collared Macaw
A. auricollis and Illiger's Macaw A. macarana may eventually follow. The
Chestnut-fronted Macaw A Severn and Military Macaw are recommended
as model populations. The question of whether there are recognizable races
of the Scarlet Macaw will be investigated. This species is designated for
Stable Population status, with eventually fewer numbers in zoos than at
present. The Blue and Gold Macaw, bred by more zoos in the USA than
any other parrot, and exceeded in numbers hatched only by the Sun Conure
(Table 3), is listed for eventual phasing-out, along with the Green-winged
Macaw, both to be replaced by conservation-priority macaws.
The Sun Conure is recommended as a Display Population, with breeding
severely curtailed. The Thick-billed Parrot's intensive SSP programme will,
of course, continue, while the Golden Conure will be managed under a PMP.
Model Population status is recommended for the Blue-headed Conure A.
acuticauda, a species almost unknown in aviculture until it was imported in
quantity during the 1980s, and the Painted Conure Pyrrhura p. picta,
produced in numbers by San Antonio Zoo until 1993 (Table 3) but not
recently. None of the other conures are suggested for any sort of zoo breeding
programme. In situ projects are recommended for the Orange-fronted or
Halfmoon Conure Aratinga canicularis eburnirostrum, Hispaniolan Conure
A. chloroptera and Golden-capped Conure. The Nanday Conure, Patagonian
Conure Cyanoliseus patagonus and Monk Parrot Myiopsitta monachus are
all listed for eventual phasing-out. Other species of conures may be
considered for zoo programmes if the TAG is so advised by private
aviculturists.
A model population of one or two species of Forpus parrotlets is
recommended, in co-ordination with private aviculture. Any zoo
programmes for Pionus species await advice from aviculturists. Both species
of caiques Pionites spp. are suggested as exhibit populations. The Hawk-
headed Parrot Deroptyus accipitrinus , for which a studbook has already
been published (Rhoades, 1992), is designated for a PMP.
Population Management Plan status is recommended for the Yellow-
shouldered Amazon Amazona barbadensis, Bodin's Amazon A. festiva
bodini , Cuban Amazon, Vinaceous Amazon A. vinacea , Green-cheeked
Amazon A. viridigenalis and Yellow-headed Amazon A. oratrix, with an
investigation of the taxonomy of the last species. Stable Population status
is suggested for the White-fronted Amazon A. albifrons, Yellow-cheeked
Amazon A. a . autumnalis. Mealy Amazon A. farinosa, Finsch's Amazon A.

finschi, Yellow-naped Amazon A. auropalliata and Yellow-crowned Amazon
A. ochrocephala, again with an investigation of the taxonomy of captive
specimens of the last species. Model Population status is suggested for the
Black-billed Amazon A. agilis , Yellow-billed Amazon A. collaria. Festive
Amazon A. f festiva , Tucuman Amazon A. tucumana and Hispaniolan
Amazon A. ventralis. SSP status will continue for the St. Vincent and Red-
browed Amazons. A phase-in programme, eventually resulting in a PMP is
suggested for the Blue-cheeked Amazon A. dufresniana. On the other hand,
phase-out programmes are recommended for the Blue-fronted Amazon and
Orange-winged Amazon A. amazonica.
The Regional Collection Plan for parrots is intended to be flexible,
reflecting changes in conservation status and aviculture. It is thus planned
that participants will meet regularly to review and consider recommendations.
By co-ordinating efforts with American private aviculturists, instead of
duplicating them, and focusing their own unique resources on in situ projects
and the propagation of taxa not readily available to, or impractical for, private
aviculture, with attendant research, zoos in the USA will have a positive
effect through their parrot programmes.

Only about 250 Wattled Cranes Bugeranus carunculatus remain in South
Africa. To help ensure their survival, the Endangered Species Trust, which
incorporates the S. A. Crane Working Group, is appealing for donations
towards an education programme to make farm workers aware of the
importance of conserving South African cranes by protecting wetlands and
preventing the poisoning of these birds. Donations will also by used to help
support the Wattled Crane Reintroduction Programme. Other endangered
species are the Blue or Stanley Crane Anthropoides paradisea and the
Crowned Crane Balearica regulorum. Information about the S. A. Crane
Working Group is available from Dr John Ledger, Director, Endangered
Wildlife Trust, Private Bag XII, Parkview 2122, South Africa, to whom
donations can be sent.

Estrilda paludicola
by Neville Brickell
The Fawn-breasted Waxbill is also known as the Buff-bellied or Marsh
Waxbill, with E. p. ochrogaster being known as the Abyssinian or Ethiopian
Fawn-breasted Waxbill.
This species measures 10cm-11 cm (approx. 4in-4&amp;apos;/ 4 in) long. Six races
are described, the nominate race having the forehead, crown and nape brown
washed with grey. The mantle, back and wing-coverts are reddish brown,
with the lower rump and upper tail-coverts red, and the tail black. Its cheeks
are light huffish grey, the chin and throat are yellowish white, with much of
the remainder of the underparts pale buff, with a rose coloured belly patch
(in the case of the male) and yellowish buff under tail-coverts. The irides
are red or reddish brown. The bill is orange red, and the legs and feet are
dark brown. The female is paler below and lacks the rose colouring present
on the male's belly, which in the female is white. The juvenile is similar to
the female, except that it has a dark bill.
Field characteristics
A small brown bird with a bright red bill and rump, and huffish, whitish
or pale greyish face and underparts (Goodwin, 1982).
Status, distribution and geographical variations
The Fawn-breasted Waxbill is local and generally uncommon. The
nominate race occurs from northern Zaire to Uganda, western Kenya and
southern Sudan.
The other races are:
E. p. roseicrissa found in south-west Uganda and north-west Tanzania,
differs from E. p. paludicola in having the forehead to the nape uniform
brown with the mantle, and in having paler grey underparts.
E. p. ochrogaster from Ethiopia and south-eastern Sudan, differs from
E. p. paludicola in having the underparts heavily suffused with rich golden
buff.
E. p. marwitzi from Shinyanga, south of Lake Victoria, and the Iringa
highlands of Tanzania, differs from E. p. paludicola in having the upperparts
darker brown and the chin and breast grey.
E. p. benguellensis from Angola, northern Zambia and extreme south-
west Tanzania, differs from E. p. paludicola in having the crown darker
grey and the lower rump and upper tail-coverts brighter red.
E. p. ruthae from Bolobo to Lukolela and Kunungu in central Zaire differs

from E. p. paludicola in having the upperparts pale tawny brown and the
underparts almost white (Clements et al. 1993; Howard and Moore, 1991).
Voice
There are various descriptions, with the commonest contact call described
as a nasal 'tyeek', 'tyeep' or 'tsyee' and the alarm call as 'tsyee-koo' and
'kr-yee-eh' (Immelmann et ah).
Habitat and general habits
Inhabits moist grasslands, forest edges, and clearings, usually near
streams and sometimes around villages and cultivation. E. p. ochrogaster
does not occur on the open plateau, but inhabits upland regions of Ethiopia.
In the Central African Republic the habitat is described as savanna woodland
with Terminalia laxiflora (an important timber tree) (Carroll, 1988 ; Clement
et al. 1993; Goodwin, Gledhill, 1972). It usually occurs in small or larger
flocks of up to 30 birds, often in the company of other Estrilda spp. In
captivity the Fawn-breasted Waxbill has been observed as being a lively
bird, showing no signs of being shy or nervous and fond of perching on
upright reed stems (Goodwin).
Food
Feeds largely on the seeds of grasses, as well as eating other forms of
vegetable matter and occasionally taking insects. In captivity it will eat
termites, wasp larvae or 'grubs', gnats and ant pupae, also the seeds of home
grown green millet (Brickell and Konigkramer, 1997; Goodwin; Scherterleib,
1961). This waxbill will also eat spouted seed, especially panicum millet
and spray millet, and seeding Chickweed Stellaria media (Rutgers and Norris,
1977). In South Africa it will accept Guinea Grass Panicum maximum and
Blue Panic P. laevifolium (Brickell and Konigkramer)
Display
Males have been observed performing the mating display with and
without nesting symbols held in the bill, but probably they normally display
with nesting material in the usual way (Goodwin; Immelmann et al. 1965).
Breeding
Constructs a roundish nest of dry grasses, with a downward sloping
entrance tube approximately 2.5cm (lin) long, about 10cm (4in) above the
ground in tall tufts of grass. This description presumably also includes an
unfinished 'cock's nest' above the roof of the real nest (Goodwin; Vincent,
1949). E. p. benguellensis has been recorded nesting in thick growth such
as Bracken Fern Pteridum aquilinum and wild Ginger Aframomum sp.

(Brickell and Konigkramer, 1997). Clutches, on average, number four to
six eggs, with a record of 10, probably being due to two females laying in
the same nest (Weekes in Goodwin). Goodwin also refers to a whydah's
egg, probably that of the Pin-tailed species Vidua macroura, found in a nest
together with four of the host's eggs.
Peter Paris is credited with the first captive breeding in the UK in 1971
(Coles). Scherterleib was successful in Switzerland with his birds housed
in a thickly planted open aviary (Rutgers and Norris, 1977). The first recorded
breeding in South Africa occurred in 1973. Besides a few well developed
small bushes, the aviary contained some large clumps of Eulalia Grass
Miscanthus sinensis which can grow up to 4m (13ft) tall. The nests were
made entirely of Guinea Grass Panicum maximum , lined with Natal Redtop
Rhyncheltrum repens which was supplied on a daily basis. The second nest,
in 1974, like the first the year before, contained no feathers. The first clutch
of four eggs was laid in November and the second the following year, also
consisting of four eggs, was laid in December. Incubation periods of 13
days and nestling periods of 20 and 21 days were recorded (Campbell pers.
comm.).
