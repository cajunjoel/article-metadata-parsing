CONDOR CLIFFS - THE NEW ANDEAN CONDOR
EXHIBIT AT CHESTER ZOO
by Roger Wilkinson
Andean Condors Vultur gryphus have been kept at Chester Zoo for over
25 years. A young pair were first received at Chester in April 1971. The

male of this pair was then exchanged in 1982 for an older male that had
been at Amsterdam Zoo since 1958. This bird and our original female
hatched a chick in 1985 which failed to survive and was at the time believed
to have been killed by the male parent.
Since then most eggs laid by this pair have been removed for artificial
incubation and ten chicks have been successfully hand-reared from the 11
hatched. These youngsters can now be seen at Antwerp Zoo, Moscow Zoo,
Welsh Mountain Zoo (Colwyn Bay), Chessington World of Adventures,
Colchester Zoo, the National Birds of Prey Centre (Newent), the Hawk

Conservancy (Andover) and Flamingoland (Malton). We are disappointed
that no chicks have been parent-reared at Chester. It was thought that lack
of privacy may have been one factor acting against achieving successful
parenting.
The new Condor Cliffs exhibit was designed by members of the Bird
Department working with the Estate Division at the zoo and was part funded
by a generous legacy from the late Sally, Duchess of Westminster. The
Condor Cliffs was officially opened on Tuesday, 17th December by Sally's
nephew, the zoo's president, His Grace The Duke of Westminster.

Condor Cliffs the new exhibit for Andean Condors
The aviary occupies the site of the former Brown Bear pit. The front
wall of the latter was completely demolished and replaced by a chain-link
fence to permit ground level viewing. A steel framework reaching to 12m
(39ft) high supports the 40mm (1 Vim) square nylon mesh that forms the
tented roof of this enclosure. New artificial cliff work has been constructed
along the entire 38m (approx. 124ft) back wall of the enclosure and this
includes a number of natural looking caves for roosting, shelter and nesting.
A rockwork scree extends forwards from this cliff to meet the large planted,
grassy area which occupies an extensive area of over l,200sq m (approx.
12,900sq ft). A major feature of the aviary is a large waterfall which has
been constructed from natural local sandstone. This new aviary represents
an important advance for the exhibition and improved welfare of Andean
Condors at Chester Zoo.

A partly hidden trapping area has been built close to the keeper access.
This trapping cage will be baited with food to allow trapping of the condors
when necessary. However, the normal feeding routine will be to offer the
birds the opportunity to feed on meat attached to the rib cage of a specially
commissioned artificial Llama skeleton. This skeleton has been located
near the waterfall towards the front of the aviary and the possibility of set
feeding times announced to our visitors will now be explored.
It may be that public perception will shift from the feeling that the birds
had too small a living space in their previous aviary to one that the new
Condor Cliffs aviary is under-occupied! I have already been asked by both
visitors and by zoo staff what other species may join the condors. Andean
Condors are large aggressive birds which would normally be considered
incompatible with other bird species in small aviaries. Condor Cliffs was
specifically developed to re-house our Andean Condors and as such any
extra occupants must be considered a happy bonus. With a view to increasing
the new exhibit's potential for visitor education about the role of scavengers
it would be very useful to include with the condors a collection of South
American vultures and caracaras. Whether this will work satisfactorily
will greatly depend on the individual temperaments of our Andean Condors
but also on the knowledge and skill of our keepers. I would be pleased to
hear from anyone who has had experience of managing a similar species
combination or tried mixing adult Andean Condors with other birds.

by Neville Brickell
In 1983, at the time of my first article about this species (.Avicultural
Magazine , Vo 1.89, No.3, p.159), a nest had yet to be recorded in the field
and only two captive breedings had been documented. Lawson (1970)
stated that it had been bred on a number of occasions. It was, however,
difficult to find any aviculturist who kept or bred this species some 26
years ago. Probably he was referring to successful breedings in Zimbabwe,
with whom we had little contact in those days.
Neville Brickell

The first captive record by Lawson (of Information and Research
Services) made mention of grass stems and inflorescence tops, roots and
large feathers, with a cup 40mm (approx. IVi in) in diameter and 30mm
(approx. VAin) deep which was then lined entirely with coir. The pair had
selected the top of a wooden nest-box on which to construct their nest, even
though there were many other more natural sites In the aviary. The second
captive record was by Joao in Mozambique, who described the cup shaped
nest as being built of grasses and then lined with feathers. More recently,
Clewlow and Koen, both members of the Natal Bird Breeder's Society,
supplied felt-lined canary nest-pans which also contained coir and were
then lined with moss and feathers. In addition, Clewlow also had young
reared successfully in a closed wicker basket with a small opening at one

end. In 1988, Robson (1990) discovered a nest in the Sodwana State Forest
in north-eastern KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. It contained three
eggs. The nest was concealed within the fold of a Lala Palm Hyphaene
natalensis leaf 1.6m (5ft Sin) above the ground. It was constructed of
fibres and dead creeper stems, bits of hairy leaf (not identified) and chewed
bark, bound together with the silk from caterpillar tubes. The cup was
45mm-55mm (approx. l 3 Ain-2 1 Ain) in diameter and lined with long, thin,
leaf fibres, peeled from the same species of palm. The single egg measured
15mm x 12mm. Recorded clutch sizes, incubation and nestling periods for

Nestlings have pale pinkish skin and sparse whitish down. The bill is
pale yellowish white and the mouth is bright yellow. Clewlow (1994) gave
detailed information about this species' food requirements when rearing
young. This consisted of the locally manufactured Avi-Plus canary/finch
compound, to which was added hard-boiled egg, finely grated carrot and
apple, shredded Swiss chard and spinach, and a teaspoonful of SMA infant
milk formula. Half a cup of water was added to the above and produced a
well tested and relished softfood. Mound termites were readily accepted as
were the seeding heads of Guinea Grass Panicum maximum and Shepherd's
Purse Capsella bursa-pastoris.

HUSBANDRY AND BREEDING OF THE MOUNT APO
LORIKEET Trichoglossus johnstoniae AT LORO PARQUE
</sectionHeader>

by Roger G. Sweeney
The Mount Apo Lorikeet Trichoglossus johnstoniae , also sometimes
referred to as the Mindanao Lorikeet or Mrs. Johnstone's Lorikeet, is
designated full species status within the genus Trichoglossus (Forshaw,
1989). Two races have been described (Rand and Rabor, 1959; DuPont,
1971), but recent taxonomic assessments (Forshaw, 1989; Sweeney,
unpublished) suggest that no differentia exist. The length of this species is
20cm (8in) (Forshaw, 1989). Weights recorded for five adult birds at Loro
Parque produced a mean weight of 56g (range 52-59g), with no noticeable
differences in body weight between males and females within the sample.
The main plumage is green, with the forehead, lores and chin rose red,
with a distinctive purple brown band reaching from the lores to the occiput.
There is some yellow on the underside of the secondaries and throat. The
breast feathers are yellowish green at the base, with darker green tips
producing a barred appearance. The tail is green above and olive yellow
below. The bill is orange-red in adult birds. The irides are red and the legs
are greenish-grey.
This species is restricted to mountain regions of the island of Mindanao
in the Philippines. The fact that this species is endemic to Mindanao has
meant that it has rarely been seen outside of the Philippines. Its status in
the wild is described as locally common, but its range is restricted and is
being increasingly threatened by changes in land use. Very few historical
records exist for this species in captivity. Almost certainly the first birds to
be kept in captivity outside of the Philippines were those collected by Walter
Goodfellow, who discovered this species in 1903, while on a collecting
expedition for the English aviculturist, Mrs. Johnstone. Goodfellow gave
this species the common name of Mrs. Johnstone's Lorikeet and three years
after their collection from the wild, Mrs. Johnstone recorded the first captive
breeding of this species when two chicks were reared in 1906 (Goodfellow,
1906). Since this time perhaps the only collection to have experience with
this species before the 1990s was San Diego Zoo in California which has
maintained and bred the Mount Apo Lorikeet for several decades. San
Diego Zoo first bred the species in 1941, but no further breeding was
achieved until the 1970s. From 1971 onwards, San Diego began to breed
the Mount Apo Lorikeet more consistently and has in the last 25 years
raised a large number of them. The Mount Apo Lorikeet started to become
more widely kept in international aviculture in recent years as a result of
successful captive breeding from 1990 onwards at the breeding centre of

Antonio de Dios in the Philippines. This has allowed first generation birds
to be sent to several collections in Europe, which have included both Loro
Parque in Spain and Vogelpark Walsrode in Germany (Sweeney, 1994,
1996). At Loro Parque this species first arrived in the collection in 1990,
but the first successful rearing was not achieved until 1994. Since this
time further breeding has followed and is now becoming more consistent.
During the 1996 breeding season for example, two breeding pairs reared
five chicks between them, four of which were parent-reared without
intervention, the fifth chick being hand-reared.
Husbandry
Husbandry guidelines for the Mount Apo Lorikeet at Loro Parque do
not vary significantly from other Loriidae species in the collection - all
receive husbandry similar to guidelines published on the care of this family
(Low, 1992; Sweeney, 1993). In more temperate countries the relatively
small body size of these species means that extra care should be taken
during periods of cold weather to ensure that they are not allowed to become
chilled.
Roger G. Sweeney

As with most Loriidae , Mount Apo Lorikeets normally roost inside the
nest-box during the night, but in countries where the temperature may fall
towards freezing point at night it would be wise to consider bringing these
birds inside during the winter months or moving their nest-box in to a

heated shelter if this has been included in the design of the aviary. As a
guideline, Mount Apo Lorikeets, once established and acclimatised, should
have a similar level of hardiness to the more familiar Goldie's Lorikeet
Trichoglossus goldiei and Iris Lorikeet Trichoglossus iris.
One pair of Mount Apo Lorikeets at Loro Parque are housed in the
exhibition area for Loriidae , while other breeding pairs are housed in
suspended cages in the off-exhibit breeding areas of the park. Both types
of housing used have produced successful breeding. The exhibition cage
measures 250cm x 105cm x 215cm (approx. 8ft 2in x 3ft 6in x 7ft lin).
Both sides and the back wall are solid, with the front panel and front half
of the roof made of wire mesh; the back half of the roof is of solid
construction. The nest-box in the exhibition cage is secured against the
back wall. The exhibition cage is furnished with two main horizontal
perches and in addition a fresh branch of pine wood is always present as
chewing/play material. The suspended breeding cages used in our off-
exhibit areas are made entirely from wire mesh and measure 300cm x 95cm
x 95cm (9ft lOin x 3ft 1 Vim x 3ft IViin). They are suspended at a height of
125cm (4ft LAin), measured from the ground to the base of the cage, which
means that the height of perching in the cage is slightly above the head
height of the keeper. The front area of the cage, where food and water is
supplied, is covered by a roofing sheet to protect against excessive sun,
rain and possible contamination of the food by wild birds living around the
breeding area. The cages are positioned with the length of the cage
extending away from the service pathway at a right-angle, with the nest-
box positioned at the back and secured on the outside, with a hole in the
wire allowing the birds to enter the nest-box. The area surrounding the
back of the cage is planted and rarely disturbed other than for brief nest
inspections. The suspended cages are also furnished with two main
horizontal perches, one towards the front and one towards the back of the
cage. Additional chewing and play material is also provided. In recent
years captive raised Mount Apo Lorikeets have accepted a varied diet. At
Loro Parque in recent years the birds have been maintained and bred while
receiving two different commercial brands of liquid nectar food, but they
have also always had access on a daily basis to various fruits (which can
include on rotation apple, pear, papaya, banana, prickly-pear, cactus fruit
etc.), green foods (commonly alfalfa or lettuce) and a dish which contains
small millet/canary seed and a pelleted food (Lory Select). The diet used
since 1995 onwards has been as follows:
7.00am: Biotropic Lory Nectar (approx. 100ml per pair prepared to
manufacturer's instructions); segments of two or more fruits and green
foods as described above; dish containing small millet and canary seed and
Lory Select pellets (approx. 15g of seed and 15g of pellets, but this is varied

according to the appetite of each pair and additional pellets may be added).
3.00pm: The nectar dish is removed and replaced with another 100ml
of freshly prepared food in a sterile dish and any remaining fruit is removed.
Additional pellets are also given if the morning allowance has been
completely eaten.
Particular attention is given to monitoring the quality of drinking water
for our Loriidae. This is mainly due To specific water quality problems
which are endemic to Tenerife. We have also noted that the control of
certain medical problems common in Loriidae , particularly enterobacterial
infections and protozoa can be dramatically improved once the water supply
is controlled. At present we first chlorinate our water supply, then pass it
through a reverse osmosis filtration machine, followed by an ultra-violet
light sterilizer before it is used in our food preparation or offered as drinking
water. Water used in the showers and to clean the cages is chlorinated but
not filtered. Medical problems which have so far been recorded in captive
populations of the Mount Apo Lorikeet have included Protozoal infections
(notably trichamonas), enterobacterial infections (notably E. coli,
salmonella, enteritis etc,), fungal infections and occasional ectoparasitic
infestations, Birds can be screened for these ailments whenever they are
routinely captured or handled.
Breeding
To date at Loro Parque most of the decisions about the pairing of birds
have been made for population management reasons (genetic/demographic
considerations) rather than allowing natural mate selection by birds in a
communal situation. This has been the case due to the relatively limited
population of birds that we have to work with and the need to keep potential
breeding pairs unrelated. Even though pairings made have not been from
mate-choice selection, so far almost no problems have been experienced as
long as proper care is taken when first introducing the birds. We have had
no cases of aggression, although the breeding success of pairs does reflect
on their compatibility. In cases of pairs with poor breeding success, we try
to change the pairings if we have a suitable choice of alternative partner
available.
Nest-boxes used by Mount Apo Lorikeets at Loro Parque measure 46cm
high x 17cm x 17cm (18m high x 6%in x 6 3 Ain). The entrance hole is near
the top of the front and measures 5cm (2in) in diameter. The boxes are
constructed from thick plyboard except for the floor base which is made
from several layers of fine wire mesh to provide better drainage. An
inspection door is included on the left side panel of the nest-box, about
15cm (6in) up from the base to allow easy access for the observation of
eggs or chicks. An interior ladder up the front facing panel is also included

in the design of the box. Wood shavings are used exclusively as the nesting
medium. A layer of about 10cm (4in) is placed inside the nest-box. The
condition of the nesting medium is monitored regularly and changed when
required, particularly when chicks are present in the nest-box. In recent
years, three different pairs have bred and fledged young in the nest-boxes
described. The clutch has always consisted of two eggs and the incubation
period is 23 days. Newly-hatched chicks weigh 3-4g, and when parent-
raised generally fledge after six weeks.

Adult pair with two newly emerged young.
From a hand-reared chick I made the following observations on the
chick's development (Sweeney, 1994). The skin is pink and is covered
with long grey-white primary natal down. The beak and toe nails are black
at the time of hatching, The primary natal down begins to thin out in the
second week and is replaced by shorter, denser, secondary down. The eyes
begin to slit at around Day 12 and are fully open by Day 16. The first pin
feathers which begin to appear are those of the flight feathers which takes
place at around Day 24 onwards, followed quickly by pin feathers on the
head, tail and then the rest of the body. By Day 40 the chick is close to
being fully feathered except for its flanks. By Day 47 the chick is completely
feathered, is perching well and feeding itself from a food dish which is
held up towards it. The chick was fully weaned within the next week to ten

identifiable as being immature due to their dark iris, black beak and pale
grey coloration of the exposed skin of the pre-orbital ring and cere. The
beak coloration begins to change towards orange after ten weeks of age
onwards, but the dark iris coloration and the lighter grey coloration on the

rearing has been successfully carried out both at Loro Parque and in the
Philippines and the following guidelines have been prepared for the neonatal
care of this species.
Incubation
Incubation temperature is maintained at 37.4*C (99.3*F) from the
beginning of incubation until the time of internal pipping, from which
time the temperature is lowered and maintained at 36.6*C (97.9*F).
Humidity is maintained at around 55% for most of the incubation period
then raised to 90% or higher once internal pip (or external pip) has been
recorded. If eggs are being incubated from an early state, or if candling of
the egg indicates an abnormal size of the air sac compared to the relative
stage of embryo development, then closer management of egg weight loss
can be implemented (Harvey, 1990; Sweeney, 1993). From the beginning
of the incubation period until internal pipping has been observed, the eggs
should be turned several times each day, but once pipping has taken place
the eggs should no longer be turned (Harvey, 1990; Sweeney, 1993).
Emergence from the egg should take place within 48 hours of external
pipping being recorded.
Hand-rearing
Upon hatching the chicks remain in the hatching incubator for up to
five hours to allow them to rest and dry. Once moved to an incubator they
are initially maintained at a temperature of 36*C (96.8*F). After the first
few days the temperature is slowly lowered by about one degree every two
days, although this can vary depending upon the chick's reaction. The
chicks are housed in small stainless steel containers which are easy to
sterilise. The container is padded with kitchen paper towel for the first two
weeks of the chick's rearing period, the towelling being shaped within the
container to give support to the chick's body. From two weeks onwards,
clean wood shavings are used instead of paper towels. The chick is usually
ready to accept its first food around five hours after a normal hatch. The
first food normally given to the chick after hatching is simply lactated

ringers solution with a strain of psittacine-specific lactobacillus added.
Depending upon the appearance of the chick, as to what degree it appears
dehydrated after hatching, the first three or four feeds can also consist
simply of lactated ringer solution to ensure the chick is correctly hydrated
before normal feeding begins. Once normal feeding begins then the diet
fed to the chicks throughout their rearing period is a commercial hand"
rearing diet (Pretty Bird). This produce is manufactured with several levels
of fat and for Loriidae species we always use the formula with 19% protein
and 8% fat. The formula is prepared to dilution shown (Table 1). With all
the Loriidae , once the food has been prepared as shown in Table 1, an
additional 2g of Fructosa is added to every lOOg of formula to stimulate
appetite. The food is always fed at a temperature of 40*C (104*F), although
this may cool slightly during the course of feeding. The feeding instrument
preferred for Loriidae species is always a spoon. In the first few days after
hatching, the chick is fed about every IVi hours between 6.00 am -12.00 pm.
As the chick grows and the food becomes thicker, then the time interval
between feeds is extended as shown below.

From Day 35 onwards the rearing formula starts to have normal nectar food added.
Weaning, as with most \0x25A0 Loriidae, is straight forward and normally is
accomplished without&amp;apos;problem in all cases before Day 60. In addition to
the dish of nectar being provided inside the cage, segments of fruit such as
apple, pear and papaya are also placed at perch height. Once the chick has
been identified with a closed leg band, it is always ideal when possible to
then house the chick with other closely-related lorikeets of a similar size,

this is particularly advantageous during the weaning period and afterwards.
Once the birds are independent it is also good to house them socially for
their first six months prior to future pairing decisions being made.
Sexing of Mount Apo Lorikeets
Slight visual indication of sex can be noted in the appearance of the
birds, but sexing by DNA blood sample analysis or endoscopy is always
recommended. Given the small size of this species, endoscopy is not
normally undertaken before the birds are at least six months old.
Future Prospects for the European Population
During the meeting of the Taxon Advisory Group for Psittacines which
took place during the 1995 EAZA/EEP convention in Poznan, Poland, the
subject of European collection planning for Loriidae species was discussed
and a proposal was put forward that the Mount Apo Lorikeet should be the
subject of a European regional studbook. This proposal was formally
supported by the EEP committee later in the same year (Sweeney, 1996).
At present the small population which is registered in the studbook is held
between three European zoos and a few private keepers. Several other
aviculturists are known to keep and breed this species but they have
expressed the belief that a studbook for this species is not in their interests.
One letter I received from a private breeder complained that the creation of
a studbook would mean an eventual decrease in the monetary value of the
species, once more surplus birds became available and that the private
breeder would encounter problems when trying to sell related stock. This
is a very unfortunate side of aviculture, when financial considerations are
placed so clearly above the long term welfare of the birds concerned. The
breeder who wrote this letter has several breeding pairs and claimed that a
studbook was not required because he is breeding the species so well. This
same breeder obtained all of his founder stock from the breeding centre of
Birds International during a period when only a few bloodlines were
breeding in the Philippines. Therefore, the 50 plus young birds that have
been bred and sold as pairs from his founder stock are without doubt very
closely-related. Some aviculturists have the idea that a studbook is required
only when a species does not breed well and that once it begins to breed
freely this is no longer required.
For the Mount Apo Lorikeet the opposite is true. All of the founder
stock from which the European population has developed has come from
one breeding centre, meaning that the founder stock may already be closely
related and the prolific breeding from some pairs, whose offspring has
since been sold as brother to sister pairs, now means that the genetic base
of the European population must be of some concern. The fact that the

species is now breeding well from some pairs does not necessarily mean
that the species has a good future in captivity, as a few breeders have bred
and sold large numbers of closely related stock, meaning that a studbook is
very much required to ensure that the population grows with a balanced
genetic base. Anyone keeping the Mount Apo Lorikeet who is not already
in contact with me is welcome to get in touch for more details of participation
in the studbook.

The Lesser Green Broadbill Calyptomena viridis is one of 14 species
of the family Eurylaimidae. This species was first kept in captivity in 1928
in London. The first captive breeding took place at the Wuppertal Zoological
Garden in Germany in 1980 (Webster, 1991). The only other documented
successful fledging occurred at the San Diego Zoo in 1993 (Lewins, 1996).
Lesser Green Broadbills are found from peninsular Thailand, Malaya and
Sumatra to Borneo. Both sexes have stout bodies with short necks and a
dense growth of feathers from the cere extending over most of the bill. The
males are bright green with black bars on the primaries and secondaries
and black dots in front of and behind the eyes. The females are a dull
green and lack the black markings.
Lincoln Park Zoo first had broadbills in its collection in 1969. The
breeding pair has.been together since 2nd June 1994. The renovated Bird
House was reopened in 1991 and this particular exhibit design has been
conducive to breeding. The exhibit housing this pair measures 30ft x 20ft
x 20ft (approx. 9.2m x 6m x 6m) and contains a variety of plants including
Ficus benjamina, Ficus allii, Ficus elastica, Rhapis excelsa, Spathiphyllum,
Philodendron , and Epipremnum aureum . The concrete walls are painted
as a deep forest and the front is glass with a thin strip of wire mesh on
either side. Skylights on the top of the building provide natural sunlight
which is supplemented with halogen lights. There is one door for keeper
access and a waterfall with three pools. The exhibit is misted daily. Several
other bird species, each a pair with offspring, share this exhibit including
four Crested Wood Partridges Rollulus roulroul , four Red-legged
Honeycreepers Cyanerpes cyaneus and three Jambu Fruit Doves Ptilinopus
jambu.
The broadbills have access to a variety of foods including cooked rice,
chunks of banana, grapes, blueberries, orange, papaya, spinach, kale, bird
of paradise, gel-based diet 1 , peas, com, soaked dog chow, chopped hard-
boiled egg with the shell, waxworms 2 , crickets and mealworms. In October
jumbo mealworms were added to the daily diet. There is another special
diet for the honeycreepers which the broadbills later showed an interest in.
It includes soaked monkey chow, honey, and banana topped with chopped
papaya, apple, and orange.
Previous to 1995, stimulation included an artificial, domed nest
measuring 5in x 3Vfcin x 4in (12.7cm x 8.9cm x 10.2cm). The female
entered it several times but did not lay any eggs. Keepers built a second

nest constructed of cotton mesh in a tear-drop shape with grasses woven
through. Dried grasses, fiddleleaf ficus leaves Ficus lyrara and Rhapis
excelsa leaves were offered loose as well as tied in a ball with jute twine to
stimulate nest building. In October of 1995 the female began to show
interest in dried grasses. The pair was nearly always more active in the
early morning, during the mid-afternoon mist, and in the late afternoon.
In mid-November the female was seen tapping on the side of the male's
bill, though no regurgitation was observed. By December she was becoming
more aggressive, perching in new places, and flying to the keeper access
door and to the ground. In January new nest material was added including
dried Spanish moss, excelsior, strips of brown packing paper, green tissue
paper, tan streamers, and green Christmas ribbon. The female's obvious
preference was Spanish moss though she did use a lot of the brown paper
strips. It was at this time that the pair began to show interest in the
honeycreeper diet. In February various palm fibres were added; blond
coconut fibres were the most utilized by the pair.
In mid-January the female looked as though she was inviting copulation
and the male frequently raised his crest. At various times the male offered
jumbo mealworms to her, but the female always rejected them. There was
an 'aerial fight' at the end of February that might have been a precursor to
copulation. At the end of February, the female was lethargic and non-
attentive and she was removed from the exhibit for treatment. The male
continued to call and search for her and she was returned to the exhibit on
9th March.
Live Spanish moss was added to the exhibit in mid-March and the
female was immediately interested. Though there were various pre-woven
nests available, she began building her own on 24th March. The male
stood guard on a perch directly in front of the nest before she flew over, and
while she added nest material. Initially there were just a few strands of
Spanish moss draped over a limb 2ft (61cm) from the ground, against the
wall directly opposite the access door. The female always approached the
nest the same way. After circular flights at the top of the exhibit, she flew
low to the ground across the front of the exhibit, then to the back of the nest
(which eventually became the entrance) and finally perched on the top of
the nest. She then would climb, while flapping her wings, around the bulk
of the nest and weave fibres into it. Eventually rope fibres were offered and
the female used them almost as much as the Spanish moss. Because the
tail hung to the ground and the Crested Wood Partridges kept becoming
entangled, keepers cut it several times before its completion. The female
never seemed to mind nest manipulation or cleaning in the area.
In April the female fluttered in front of the male several times, but no
attempt at copulation was observed. A crude cavity appeared in the nest
and the male stood guard while the female was inside. It was around this

time that the male began to moult. The female continued to add to the nest
until the beginning of May when she began a second nest. The second nest
was also against the wall opposite the door and was anchored on the stalk
of a palm leaf 3ft (91.5cm) off the ground. It was mainly constructed from
rope fibre, Spanish moss, and dark, coarse palm fibre. The female created
a hole in the second nest by pushing brown packing strips all the way
through. Rope fibre was eliminated because the Crested Wood Partridges
kept becoming entangled. The brown paper strips were also eliminated
because they were not flexible enough.
By the end of May, the female had begun her moult and nest activity
ceased. In the beginning of August, both adults' moults were complete.
The female's plumage seemed whiter than before, especially in the area of
the cloaca. The males plumage, too, was brighter but it was indiscernible
if the bars on his wings had changed at all. The female had ripped apart
the second nest and finished construction of the first nest. She also began
collecting Ficus allii leaves and lining the nest with them. Fresh green
leaves were offered, but she seemed to prefer the dry leaves. Several days
later she was seen in the cavity pulling fibres up to shape the entrance and
on 23rd August two eggs were confirmed.
The male was left in the exhibit and guarded both the nest and the
female while she was inside, but he never had any active part in nest building
or incubation. Throughout incubation, use of the misters was reserved for
when the female emerged from the nest because she enjoyed bathing. In
fact, she would immediately fly to her normal bathing perch in anticipation
of a shower. The male continued to displace and chase her. On 8th
September the male was unusually vocal. On 9th September the female
was spending more time off the nest and hanging on the edge of the nest
entrance with her head inside. On the 10th the female flew out of the nest
with an eggshell. Examination of the shell fragment indicated a perfect
hatch. It measured approximately 19mm wide.
The female usually fed the chicks before 8.00am and continued at various
times throughout the day. She most frequently chose waxworms and papaya
followed by mealworms and avocado (the latter had been added to their
diets a few days prior to the hatch). The male was not observed feeding the
chicks though he did still guard the female and the nest site. On the 16th
the female began spending all her time out of the nest and the chicks could
be heard begging for food. On the 18th, at 11 days old, the chicks' heads
could be seen protruding from the nest when the female fed. The Crested
Wood Partridges were removed from the exhibit on the 20th to prevent
them from interfering with the chicks. It was noted the broadbill chicks
had bluish-green skin and were covered with a small amount of down but
no feather tracts were visible. At 20 days, it was observed that the chicks
were fully feathered. On the 28th the male was observed next to the nest,

watching and calling. No chicks were visible at the time. At 22 days old,
the first chick emerged from the nest. There was concern for the second as
the bill was visible but did not seem to move. However, by mid-afternoon
it was perched on the rim of the nest entrance and after a few minutes, it
fledged. Both chicks' bodies were greyish green with light grey on the
underside. Their tail feathers had not yet emerged. Both had yellow beaks
with black at the tips.
After the chicks fledged, the male's role expanded and he was observed
guarding and feeding the chicks though the female still provided the majority
of the chicks' nourishment. The chicks' diet remained approximately the
same, mostly wax worms, papaya, mealworms, and avocado though a variety
of other fruits and vegetables were offered. On the fifth day after fledging,
the female laid a piece of papaya on the perch next to the chick who picked
it up and ate it. On 7th October the chicks were obviously more aware than
before and the female appeared to be trying to wean them. On 9th October
the female was observed at a food dish showing a chick how to pick up food
but the female continued to feed the chicks.
The chicks found leaves and sticks irresistible as playthings and were
seen drinking from leaves when the misters were turned on. Both chicks
enjoyed the mist spray and bathed as enthusiastically as the adults. On 7th
October one of the chicks was seen mimicking the 'goik goik' head bobbing
call of the adults but no actual vocalization was heard. On the 11th both
chicks were observed head bobbing and 'goik goik' calling. Additionally,
on 8th October one chick was observed aggressively chasing a Jambu Fruit
Dove off a perch.
Throughout October all four were frequently seen perching together
and behaving as a family unit. By the end of October the chicks were fully
weaned. On 29th October all four were caught and the chicks were banded
and blood feather sexed. The chick that was later determined to be female
weighed 57.3g. The other chick, a male, weighed 56.9g.
By the end of November both adults began exhibiting signs of aggression
toward the chicks and the adult female began showing interest in nest
material. In the beginning of December the adult female was observed
with grasses and fibres in her beak. She flew from perch to perch beating
them against a branch while the juvenile female seemed to mimic her.
Subsequently the juvenile female was often observed manipulating nest
material. In early January the juvenile female was on the same branch as
the nest holding grass strands in her beak. On 10th January 1997, at 123
days, the chicks were taken out of the exhibit. The male weighed 51g and
the female 60g.
Throughout the pair's breeding cycle, various vocalizations were heard.
Most were produced by the male. The most common was the 'goik goik'
call, with or without the head bob. This is done by both the male and

female but the male is usually louder. It seems to be the basic
communication, the 'where are you' call. The degree of display or volume
seems to change the meaning of this call on occasion. For example, when
the female was reintroduced to the exhibit on 9th March, every feather on
the male's body was erect, including his crest, and he called loudly. His
body was very rigid with extreme excitement. A variation of this call,
heard only from the male, includes a 'squeak' between each call when the
head bobs back up. There is also the male's ascending 'trill' call, which
may be associated with danger or excitement and was frequently heard
when the male chased the female during misting. Another vocalization is
the soft 'purring' call, similar to the 'trill' but not ascending. Only the
male has been heard performing this call. His throat feathers are erect
during the 'purr' call, which was performed mostly in the late afternoons
after the chicks had fledged. The male also made some unusual vocalizations
just after the chicks fledged that had not been heard before or since. He
made a high squealing 'caa', almost like a chicken. It was heard when the
male was agitated, possibly because the chicks had only recently emerged
from the nest. The female made a low, softly pulsating call while she fed.
One last call to be noted is the 'tarzan' call, performed only by the males
when they were housed without females.
Some of the things we felt were important include:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.975205" page_id="56293876"  page_num="19" year="" vol="">
1) Privacy and security for nest site.
2) Proper diet. Sufficient insects offered, especially jumbo mealworms.
3) Acceptable nesting material including Spanish moss, soft fibres and
even fresh grasses.
4) Daily misting.
5) One of the most important things seemed to be to provide constant
stimulation. Any kind of activity or change is a stimulus.
'Gel-based diet consists of ground extruded, chopped fruits and gelatin.
2 Waxworms are kept for three days on a special, nutrient medium.

EXPERIENCES KEEPING AND BREEDING THE WHITE-
FRONTED BEE-EATER Merops bullockoides IN THE
ZOOLOGICAL GARDEN COLOGNE

Introduction
In one section of the pheasantry in the Zoological Garden Cologne we
keep African birds. In one of the combined indoor/outdoor aviaries, made
to look like an African riverbank, live White-fronted Bee-eaters Merops
bullockoides , Baglafecht Weavers Ploceus baglafechi reichenowi and
Egyptian Plovers Pluvianus aegyptius.
This article summarizes our experiences keeping and breeding the
White-fronted Bee-eater.
General
There are 25 species of bee-eaters. They vary in size from 14cm-35cm
(5Vfcin-13%in) long. Most have colourful plumage and a curved bill. The
tail has 12 feathers and in some species the central tail feathers are longer
than the others. Bee-eaters live in the warmer regions of the Old World,
where most prefer open landscapes. They are mainly insectivorous and
catch most of their prey in the air, especially bees. Bee-eaters breed in
holes which they excavate themselves. Often you find their nest holes in
riverbanks. Some species, such as the Rosy Bee-eater M. malimbicus , breed

Systematics
Bee-eaters are in a family of their own - the Meropidae. The White-
fronted Bee-eater is a member of the genus Merops. There is just the
nominate form, which has no known races.
Description
The White-fronted Bee-eater is 21.5cm-23.5cm -9!4in) long and
weighs 31g-35g (Fry and Fry, 1992). Its forehead is dirty white, its crown
is mealy and the nape, breast and belly are buff. It has a black mask, a
white chin and cheeks, and a silky scarlet throat. Its wings and tail are
green, and the vent, under and upper tail-coverts are midnight blue.
Distribution
West Gabon, Zaire and Kenya, south to Okavango, northern Botswana,
and Transvaal and Natal, South Africa.

In the wild
Open country, bushland and woodland along rivers are the habitat of
the White-fronted Bee-eater. There you can find them at altitudes of up to
2,000m (approx. 6,500ft) (Fry, 1984).
This species breeds in colonies usually of ten to 20 nests. Occasionally
you will find colonies of up to 450 birds. Interestingly, about 60% of the
breeding pairs have helpers (Emlen, 1981). Helpers are young birds from
the previous breeding season but experienced adult birds will also cooperate
in rearing the young. There are one to five helpers per nest.

White-fronted Bee-eaters are monogamous. They stay together for their
lifetime. There is something like a social structure with one to five pairs
forming a clan. Only members of the clan are allowed to visit the nest
holes. A study of this species at Nakuru, Kenya, revealed that 80-140 nest
holes were used by about 62 different clans (Hegner et al., 1982).
The White-fronted Bee-eater breeds in the dry season. The colonies are
often found near colonies of (Nubian) Carmine Bee-eaters M. nuhicus.
Nest places are changed yearly. Normally the birds breed only once a year.
In Zimbabwe the normal clutch is 2-5 eggs, with the average being 3.23
eggs. In Kenya clutches are smaller (Hegner et al., 1979). The average
egg size is 22.7mm x 18.8mm. Copulation occurs several times a day.
The incubation period varies from 19-21 days and the nestling period is
about 32 days.

This bee-eater is insectivorous. We know that about 87.3% of the insects
which it catches are Hymenoptera. About 50% of them are Honey Bees
Apis mallifera, 20% are bees of the genus Trigona and 17% are other
Hymenoptera. The other insects are 6% beetles ( Coleoptera ), 5% flies
(.Brachycera ) and bugs ( Heteroptera ), as well as moths ( Tineidae ), butterflies
(.Lepidoptera ), crickets (Sanatoria) and others. White-fronted Bee-eaters
have special territories where they hunt. About 50% - 70% of hunting
flights are successful.

Bee-eaters are seldom kept. Most of those which are live in zoological
gardens and bird parks. There are only a few private aviculturists who
keep these birds, maybe because of their biology and specialised feeding
habits. In the early days of aviculture the idea of breeding such birds was
just a dream. In recent years however there have been articles about keeping
and breeding various species, such as the Little Bee-eater M. pusillus,
European Bee-eater M. apiaster and White-throated Bee-eater M albicollis.

falls below -5*C (23*F) do the birds have to remain inside.
On one side of the aviary outdoors there is the artificial riverbank. It is
built with a 10cm (4in) thick wall of Ytong-bricks. The front of the wall
looks loamy. It is made of mortar which is an ochre colour. In this wall we
have holes 5cm (2in) in diameter. Behind these are 11 wooden nest-boxes
20cm x 20cm x 40-55cm deep (approx. 8in x 8in x 15 3 4in - 21 3 4in deep).
We can open the nest-boxes and control what happens inside. In the first
two years we had problems with the material for the nest-boxes. We tried
different mixtures of sand and clay. If too much clay is used the sun dries
it out so fast and so hard that the birds are unable to burrow into it. Nowadays
we form the holes out of pure clay. These are then filled with 2cm-3cm

Artificial riverbank with bee-eater nest holes
We did not know the age of our birds when they were imported nor did
we know their sexes.
In 1994 they started to breed in mid-April. Copulation was observed
and three pairs laid eggs. To ensure that it was not too cold for the birds
(in April and May it can be quite cold at night here) we put a heater in the
artificial riverbank. The heater ensured that the temperature never fell
below 18*C (64*F). The humidity inside the riverbank was about 65%.
The eggs of one clutch measured 22.0mm x 18.5mm, 21.8mm x 18.4mm
and 21.6mm x 18.1mm. That year one youngster was reared. The adults
fed it with various kinds of livefood such as crickets, mealworms and bees.
All livefood is prepared with Korvimin ZVT(R) (vitamins and minerals).
Koenig (1969) wrote that during a nestling period of 32 days the young
birds ate about 625-645 insects (275g live weight, 667kcal) per bird. We
have observed helpers at the nest as in the wild.

In 1995 two pairs reared four youngsters without any problems. The
White-fronted Bee-eaters prefer the high nest holes in our artificial
riverbank (55cm-160cm/lft 9 3 Ain-5ft 3in high). In the winter of 1995-
1996 we lost two birds. We were unsuccessful in 1996. We found only four
eggs in three nest holes and some broken eggs in another hole. We had
problems with mice and even with rats. Probably the disturbance caused
by these rodents was too great and they may have eaten eggs and young.
It seems as so the food we feed our White-fronted Bee-eaters is the
reason for our success in keeping and breeding this species. We offer a
choice of different livefoods such as crickets and also bees. In fact we keep
a swarm of bees in the aviary. On one side of the exhibit behind some
plants is a bee-hive at a height of 1.2m (3ft 1 P4in). Beneath this the birds
catch all kinds of insects which try to fly through the aviary. We also have
different kinds of flowers in the aviary to help attract insects.
The birds have the opportunity to use the inside and outside enclosures
all year round. At night there is a red light inside so that the birds can see
their way around. Obviously because even in the wild the birds have to
endure different - even minus degree temperatures - we have no problems
in keeping them as we do indoors and outdoors.

I retired four years ago after 50 years specialising in the breeding and
the public display of birds and animals in zoological and botanical gardens.
The public display of birds and animals with compatible plant displays has
always appealed to me, as not only is it pleasing to the eye but stimulates
the interest and health of the inmates. Each display has its own problems
though for some inmates can be very destructive.
I have specialised with both temperate and sub-tropical displays both in
the UK and overseas. In the early pioneering days of Keston Foreign Bird
Farm we concentrated on adapting and breeding rare parrots, parrakeets,
pheasants, softbills and a wide variety of seed-eaters, to introduce and supply
for aviculture in the British climate. Mutations cropped-up and Keston
was the first to start colour breeding the wild Budgerigar Melopsittacus
undulatus from a blue Budgerigar taken from the wild in Australia, also
the blue Ring-neck Psittacula krameri from single specimens taken from
the wild in India, and the yellow Red-rump Psephotus haematonotus and
yellow Plum-head P cyanocephala , to name a few.
From these my interest continued after many years of line-breeding the
more popular varieties of parrakeets and pheasants, etc., to investigate the
fertility and development of other colour varieties. Even before I joined
Keston I had in my youth investigated the possible fertility between different
species of doves and pigeons. I paired a female Wood Pigeon Columba
palumbus (reared under domestic pigeons) with a tame male pigeon and
produced two hybrid males. Their display when adult was a bow with their
smaller tails raised on completion of the display, but both males were
infertile. I paired one hybrid to a Stock Dove C. oenas and though happily
paired it proved infertile. Next I tried pairing a female Stock Dove with a
domestic Ice Toy pigeon and the hybrid males were fertile with domestic
pigeons but not with the females. My aim was to produce a small Toy
pigeon that was not flock imprinted and would adapt to garden conditions.
I even brought in wild Rock Dove C. livia blood but unfortunately the
experiments were halted when I left Keston after one of my partners died.
Also at this time I was experimenting with the fertility of Budgerigars.
When doubts were still being expressed about them being a distinctly
different species, I paired a big male cobalt budgie to a female Bourke's
Parrakeet Neophema bourkii and these were isolated together in a small
aviary for the winter. When a nest-box was introduced in the spring
immediate interest was shown in it and with each other, mating was frequent
and several clutches of eggs were laid but all were infertile. I then tried a

female Elegant Grass Parrakeet N. elegans with a large male green budgie
and the result was the same. At the time it was suggested that the Budgerigar
might have been closely related to the lovebirds, so I placed some Peach-
faced Lovebird's Agapornis roseicollis eggs under budgies with the idea of
making it easier for the budgie-reared lovebirds to harmonize and breed
back to budgies.
There was a small problem in that lovebird chicks are born with fluff
while budgie chicks are naked and several female budgies refused to feed
these fluffy youngsters, however, some were reared successfully. One budgie-
reared female Peach-faced Lovebird was then paired to its foster-father
and although they mated all the eggs were infertile. Although we did
contemplate using two of the South American parrotlets Forpus spp. with
budgies, the parrotlets were hard to come by at the time and the experiments
came to an end.
While I was still at Keston a member of the public brought me a small
white bird, with a pink bill and eyes, which she had found in her garden.
We thought it was a canary which had escaped from somewhere, but it was
a little smaller than a Roller Canary and was the wrong shape. Instead of
the canary's arched back it had an undulating back with its tail held up. I
felt it must be an baby albino House Sparrow Passer domesticus, so after
caging it for a while and making sure it could feed itself, I released it into
a large planted aviary with a variety of other seed-eaters and an immature
male sparrow which I had trapped. The albino had to be a female, for to
produce a male, a wild female albino sparrow would have to survive to
breed and pair to a male either to which she was related or was carrying the
albino factor, which is a remote possibility.
The following year the albino female was observed coming from a
budgie's wooden nest-box hung right out in the open, a most unlikely place
for a timid House Sparrow to breed in. She laid five eggs and hatched and
reared all five young, helped by a liberal supply of livefood - but to my
horror they proved to be four females and only one male. Lemales cannot
carry the albino factor, as it is sex-linked. Therefore, it could be carried
only by her male offspring. Eventually I removed the original male and all
the normal females and just left the albino female with her son in a smaller
secluded aviary.
Due to some disturbance they missed breeding the following year and
in the third year the female was getting a bit old for breeding. She went to
nest again and laid only one to two eggs. The first time she reared one
male bird (split/albino) and then two albinos (both males). So I thought if
I could bring her through another breeding season I could pair her to an
albino male and get albinos of both sexes. This was not to be though, for I
left Keston soon afterwards. The males moulted out into beautiful little

birds. They were creamy white, with the rufous mantle of the adult male
House Sparrow, over the white body - they really were attractive.
I continued with other experiments during my years in South Africa, in
zoos, at my own bird farm at Barberton and finally at the Mitchell Park
Zoo in Durban, Natal. A friend and colleague had hybridized the African
Red-eyed Rock Pigeon (better known outside southern Africa as the Speckled
or Triangular-spotted Pigeon) C. guinea with domesticated Tiplers in an
attempt to discover their relationship to domestic pigeons. He found that
some male hybrids were fertile and proceeded to produce very attractive
pied Red-eyed Rock Pigeons.
He continually paired the hybrids back to pure Rock Pigeons and found
that the pied factor was not lost in pairing back again and again to pure
wild stock of the Red-eyed Rock Pigeon and finally he had very attractive
pied Red-eyed Rock Pigeons. Eventually whites were produced, they were
pure white with the red area surrounding the eyes - they were most attractive.
I thought about eventually having a flock of white Red-eyed Rock Pigeons
at controlled liberty but we never bred enough of them.
The same colleague in South Africa also bred colour varieties of the
Senegal or Laughing Dove Streptopelia senegalensis - pieds and whites
and cinnamons, pied cinnamons, chocolate and white pieds and many other
very attractive colours - from wild produced mutations. Unfortunately not
many aviculturists kept them and they were maintained in only a few
collections, because of the high food bills and the fact that they were not
highly saleable. Aviculturists preferred instead the more exotic Australian
doves and pigeons.
I recollect how years ago, while a pupil at Appleyard Duck and Goose
Farm in Suffolk, I was instrumental in initiating the colour varieties of the
decoy or bantam duck. In those days there was only the white miniature
decoy duck and the black (bottle green) East Indian duck. Among a
collection of ducks brought in was a little Khaki Campbell-type cross-bred
duck. It was obviously an egg layer and so the idea was conceived of an
egg laying bantam duck - a prolific layer of bantam sized eggs. The
following year this miniature duck was crossed with a very small white
decoy drake and the resultant silver Mallard-type progeny were selectively
bred for the small size, decoy boat shape and egg laying qualities, and the
silver Mallard colour. Now there are very many beautiful colours available
to duck fanciers.
I believe in seeking to expand the variety and quality of life as the aim
of the true aviculturist and, I think, that in this respect I have done my bit.

The year at Birdworld started off on an unusually hectic note, for due to
the recent take-over it was a time of major improvements and building
work, with plans for extensive refurbishments both in the park and in the
shop/restaurant starting almost immediately. Though this was good news
for all concerned on the staff, it meant major disruptions for the birds at the
start of the breeding season. This combined with some very indecisive
weather meant a rather slow start to the season compared with other years,
and also the realisation that some of our previously consistent breeding
pairs are not going to lay this year. However, we feel that what we are
missing in quantity we are making up for in quality, including a couple of
first breedings at Birdworld.
The first to make a showing in February were Indian Ring-necked

clutches, with five chicks hand-reared already from the roulrouls. In March,
two separate pairs of Waldrapp Ibis Geronticus eremita - one of our two
Red Data endangered species - went down to nest and now have three
almost fully-fledged chicks between them. Our second endangered species,
the Bali Starlings Leucopsar rothschildi , were also observed treading and
though very secretive about nest building, the collection of twigs, feathers
and leaves in one of the nest-boxes made us collectively cross our fingers.
A clutch of three eggs was laid and we decided to leave them with the
parents, and from this point on the nest-box was not approached again
until the chicks were due to hatch, as the parents were very nervous sitters,
which came off the nest at the slightest disturbance. All three eggs hatched,
which was quite an achievement considering it was this pairs' first attempt
at breeding. Very infrequent checks were made and the chicks seemed to
be doing well, with their parents waiting anxiously every day for their
second and third feeds of creepy-crawlies to ply the chicks with.
Unfortunately, however, two chicks were thrown out of the box within the
space of a couple of days. We do not know why this happened, it may just
have been inexperience on the part of the parents. The third chick continued
to prosper and, at the time of writing, has fledged and is now a very
handsome miniature of its parents, which look as though they are about to
nest for a second time.

We also had some disappointments; both Lappet-faced Vulture Torgos
tracheliotus eggs proved to be infertile and the two Raven Corvus corax
chicks that we were hand-rearing died of yolk sac infections. Many of our
usually reliable pairs of breeding macaws have yet to do anything, due to
the fact that they have been shifted around. This, along with elaborate
feeding techniques, seems to have helped the Keas Nestor notabilis to start
breeding again and we are currently hand-rearing a very healthy chick.
The Cassowaries Casuarius casuarius have also laid again this year. Three
eggs have been removed for incubation and two have been left with the
parents. We are also very pleased that our pair of Red-crowned Cranes
Grus japonensis on loan from Moscow Zoo are doing well; one chick is
currently being hand-reared, while the parents are on a second clutch of
two eggs. Another first for Birdworld is the arrival of two Turkey Vulture
Cathartes aura chicks which are being hand-reared. After initial panic on
our part, these chicks are so far proving to be exceptionally easy to feed, if
we can keep them still for long enough. The Turkey Vulture was not in
Dave Coles' list of breeding records ( Avicultural Magazine, 102, 4: 166-
168), so it would seem to be the first UK breeding of this species.
As well as some pleasing breeding results, we have also been fortunate
to get some interesting new birds. One of our most important projects
during the winter was to get the new 'Parrots in Flight' aviary up and

Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus back from breeding loan at London Zoo, and
also to get the various other macaws, amazons, cockatoos and conures
installed so that there may be a chance that they will breed there this year.
This has been achieved to some extent, as the Scarlet Macaws Ara macao
and the Patagonian Conures Cyanoliseus patagonus are already laying,
though the Scarlet Macaws have chosen to lay in an amazon size nest-box
which they can hardly fit in to. The hunt was on to find a mate for
'Bluebeard', when out of the blue some members of the public asked if they
could donate their egg-laying female to us? We jumped at the chance and
are very, very grateful to them for their kindness.

LORO PARQUE FOUNDATION TO RETURN ILLIGER'S
MACAWS TO BRAZIL
by David Waugh
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998256657894737" page_id="56293891"  page_num="34" year="" vol="">
In a Project for the Reintroduction of the Illiger's Macaw Ara maracana,
the Loro Parque Foundation (Loro Parque Fundacion) is sending 20 Illiger's
Macaws to Brazil to be released there later this year in the State of Bahia.
These macaws were bred in captivity in the world's largest parrot
collection, which is owned by the foundation and located at Loro Parque in
Tenerife, Canary Islands. This important conservation action has several
objectives, the most immediate being to determine the effectiveness of this
technique to restore viable populations of endangered parrot species to the
wild state. The results of such a carefully controlled project will help to
determine the best ways to supplement reduced wild populations of parrots,
as well as to re-establish populations of parrot species which have
disappeared locally or have become extinct in the wild. In regard to the
latter, this experimental release of Illiger's Macaws will provide valuable
information about how to restore the wild population of the world's rarest
parrot species, the Spix's Macaw Cyanopsitta spixii.
The Spix's Macaw has only one known individual, a male, remaining
in the wild state, although there are 39 registered in the globally managed
captive population, two pairs of which are in the Loro Parque Foundation
collection. As a founder member of the International Committee for the
Recovery of the Spix's Macaw, the foundation collaborates with IB AM A
the wildlife agency of the Brazilian Government, and indeed is the principal
financial supporter of a recovery programme which Involves protection of
the wild male bird, protection and restoration of its natural habitat, as well
as working closely with the local community for awareness and education
about the environment.
Thus, the captive-bred Illiger's Macaws will be released in the native
region of the Spix's Macaw, where also exists a wild population of Illiger's,
reduced by the effects of the earlier removal of young birds from their nests
for illegal trade. The entire process for the eventual release of these birds
is being carried out with reference to the guidelines of the Reintroduction
Specialist group of the IUCN - the world conservation union. Thus, every
individual has undergone the most advanced testing possible for
communicable diseases, and has shown negative for all tests. Even so, the
birds will have a four month quarantine when they arrive in Brazil, followed
by a further six months of acclimatisation at the release site, in a huge
aviary specially built and funded by the Loro Parque Foundation. The
release protocol also includes genetic and disease testing of the captive-
bred birds, as well as individuals of the same species in the recipient wild

population. To enable the project biologists in Brazil to follow the released
macaws, identify them and observe their behaviour, each one will carry a
miniature transmitter which will allow them to be found by remote means.
Each macaw also has a leg band with a unique number, and a distinct
tattoo on the bare skin of the face, harmlessly applied under anaesthesia.

Illiger's Macaw with distinguishing facial tatoo.
A key aspect of this reintroduction is the different history of each macaw
which has been bred in captivity. While some were reared by their own
parents, others were hand reared, and also there are age and sex differences
within the group to be released. The intention is to correlate any differences
in ability to survive in the wild state with the differences of history in
captivity. In this way the foundation and collaborators will be able to
determine for the future the ideal history of a captive bred macaw, or other
species of parrot, for optimum post-release survival in the wild. Although
there have been successful and well-documented reintroductions of other
kinds of animals to the wild state, the foundation will be responsible for
the first properly documented case of this happening with a parrot species.
As a founder member of the Permanent Committee for the Recovery of
the Spix's Macaw (CPRAA), the foundation collaborates with IBAMA the
wildlife agency of the Brazilian Government, and indeed is the principal
financial supporter of a recovery programme which involves protection of
the wild male bird, protection and restoration of its natural habitat, as well

THE PALM COCKATOO EUROPEAN ENDANGERED
SPECIES BREEDING PROGRAMME (EEP)

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992514945945946" page_id="56293893"  page_num="36" year="" vol="">
The Palm Cockatoo Probosciger aterrimus is one of the most charismatic
of all the larger parrots. Huge, black and crested with flaming red cheek
patches, scarce in aviculture, expensive and with a reputation of being
difficult to breed, it is many parrot keepers 5 dream bird.
Sadly for the Palm Cockatoo, never abundant in the wild, its desirability
both as an avicultural subject and as a 'status symbol' pet parrot led to an
insurmountable level of trade. This trade led to it being listed in 1975 on
Appendix II of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered
Species. This trade was then occurring despite local protection of Palm
Cockatoos in their native range in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and the
Cape York Peninsula in Australia. Trade became so significant over the
next few years that Palm Cockatoos were transferred to CITES Appendix 1
in 1987. Before that time Palm Cockatoos were still being exported in
large numbers especially from Indonesia. Palm Cockatoos are currently
listed as near-threatened in Birds to Watch 2, the world list of threatened
birds published by Birdlife International.
\0x25A0 Three races of Palm Cockatoos are currently recognised. The nominate
Probosciger aterrimus aterrimus occurs on the Am Islands, Indonesia,
Misool, southern New Guinea and Cape York. This form is by far the
commonest in captivity and because of its limited range and the fact that it
has been subjected to the greatest persecution for trade, may also be the
most threatened. The huge and magnificent Probosciger aterrimus goliath
originates from the western Papua Islands (except Misool) and southern
forests of Irian Jaya. Because of both their scarcity and size these are held
to be the most desirable by many aviculturists. The third recognised race
Probosciger aterrimus stenolophus comes from Yapen Island, Irian Jaya
and northern New Guinea and is of similar size to goliath but differs in its
narrow crest feathers. I am unfamiliar with this form in captivity and
know it only from museum specimens. \0x25A0
Other forms previously described, but not currently, generally recognised,
include Probosciger aterrimus alecto and Probosciger aterrimus
intermedins. Molecular DNA studies conducted by George Amato at the
New York Zoological Society suggest that the isolated Cape York population
may be distinct from the other populations but still need to go some way
further to determine the validity of other races. Although the largest goliath
appear clearly different from the smallest aterrimus , intermediate sized
captive birds are unassignable where, as is almost always the case, their

The present European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) for Palm
Cockatoos was developed from a UK Zoo Federation Joint Management of
Species Programme (JMSP) first proposed in 1985. This initially was
restricted to a small set of zoos within the UK and was later expanded to
include other zoos and private keepers. The first Regional Studbook for

49 birds. The total of 36 living birds then included 15 shared between
seven participating zoos and 21 in three private collections. The bulk of
these birds were located at one single private collection and only one was
captive bred. A second British Isles Studbook was published in 1991 and
following the approval of an EEP (European Endangered species breeding
Programme) for Palm Cockatoos, the first European Studbook was published
in 1993 with subsequent editions in 1994, 1995 and 1996. The latest
studbook includes an historical listing of 229 birds and a current listing of
100 living birds held by 25 zoos and four private collections. The difference
between the historical listing and the current lists in part reflects the fact
that some collections initially registered with the JMSP declined to join the

EEP or have been lost to the follow up. It also sadly results from considerable
mortality in captive Palm Cockatoos. Historical data for the Palm Cockatoo
indicates 83 deaths in the period 1960-1995. This compares to 37 hatchings
in the same period. In every year since the inception of the EEP programme,
deaths have outnumbered hatchings. Unless this trend can be reversed there
is no future for the EEP population of Palm Cockatoos. Some individual
collections both within the EEP and outside it are having more success than
others in keeping and breeding Palm Cockatoos. It is important that this
expertise is shared. We must be able to identify what factors may be associated
with successful breeding and with mortality so that both sides of the problem
can be fully addressed. Cathy King of Rotterdam Zoo is currently preparing
a questionnaire to be circulated to all holders with the aim of producing
husbandry guidelines for Palm Cockatoos.
Credit must be given to Leipzig Zoo for their success in breeding Palm
Cockatoos over the period 1981 to 1990. Other collections hatching chicks
within the EEP include Rotterdam Zoo, Palmitos Park, Loro Parque, Paradise
Park (Hayle) and most recently Tierpark Berlin. Sadly, Leipzig Zoo&amp;apos;s breeding
history was abruptly terminated by the theft of Palm Cockatoos from their
collection. Theft is a major concern for all parrot keepers, and with Palm
Cockatoos security is paramount. Over the three year period 1991 to 1993,
ten Palm Cockatoos were stolen from three collections. Increased security
measures recommended include more efficient alarm systems and more secure
accommodation. Additionally, it is recommended that all Palm Cockatoos
are microchipped. This not only deters thefts but also allows confident
recognition of individual birds if stolen birds are later recovered.
Palm Cockatoos still appear in illegal trade. These may be birds stolen
from other collections or stolen from the wild. Sensible control measures
necessary to terminate this illegal trade should be supported even though
these may inconvenience ourselves as honest and committed parrot keepers.
If we want to ensure that Palm Cockatoos will continue to be enjoyed at zoos
and in private aviculture then we must try to work together sharing our

Handbook of the Birds of the World
Although Volume 3 of the remarkable Handbook of the Birds of the
World deals with a spectrum of families that starts with the Hoatzin and
ends with the Auks, there is much in between that is of interest and value
to both private and professional aviculturists - button quail, cranes, Sun
Bittern, seriemas, various waders and much more. Like its predecessors,
the third volume sets the highest standards with impeccable text, excellent
plates by leading artists (Norman Arlott, Hilary Burn, Angels Jutglar,
Francesc Jutglar, Ian Lewington, Chris Rose, Lluis Sanz, Etal Vilaro and
Ian Willis), and a selection of colour photographs that really do have to be
seen to be properly appreciated; as with Volumes 1 and 2, most of them
illustrate bird behaviour rather than simply being portraits of individual
species. An added bonus is a superb frontispiece of cliff-nesting seabirds
in the Pribilof Islands, specially painted by Robert Bateman who has also
contributed a thoughtful Foreword. More than 30 authors are also listed
for the volume.
The book's vital statistics are, as usual, awesome. Volume 3 runs to
752 pages (each 310mm x 240mm/ 12(4in x 9 1 /2in), has 577 distribution
maps, 389 colour photographs, 60 full page plates and 8,000 bibliographical
references. It almost goes without saying that production and printing are
of the very highest quality and, despite their weight, these are not volumes
that are likely to disinegrate - even though their value as reference works
guarantees that they will have a full and active life.
The text, although succinct, is informative and easy to follow. Subject
headings are: Taxonomy, Distribution (brief information with accompanying
maps for all species), Descriptive Notes, Habitat, Food and Feeding,
Breeding, Movements, Status and Conservation, and Bibliography.
Introductions to families, in most instances occupy several pages, and are
extremely informative under such headings as Systematics, Morphological
Aspects, Habitat, General Habits, Voice, Food and Feeding, Breeding,
Movements, Relationship with Man, Status and Conservation.
This is the third volume this particular reviewer has dealt with and I
find it remarkable that I have yet to find an aspect that demands critical
comment. Putting aside its value as a reference work, there is a great deal
about the photographic content of Volume 3 to admire. The first photographs
to be encountered - several stunning shots of Hoatzin - effectively set the
standard for what follows. The photographs of cranes are outstanding and
others to take the eye include those of the Kagu, Sun Bittern, various bustards
and waders of all kinds including the Ibisbill.

A lot of money? Yes, but in exchange there is an awful lot of book. It is

With peace having returned to Mozambique, African Bird Book
Publishing judged this an opportune time to publish Birds of Southern
Mozambique by Phillip A. Clancey, D.Sc. It is a retitled, revised and updated
386-page paperback edition of the same author's earlier work titled A
Handguide to the Birds of Southern Mocambique , published in the 1970s,
which has for many years been unavailable.
Over 650 species occur in southern Mozambique (the area south of the
Zambesi) and the bulk of the book consists of an account (though not a
description) of each of these and any races which occur there. Each species
is listed under its scientific and English/South African names, and each
race is dealt with separately. The account includes reference to the status
of each species and race, the most important locality records and their
authors' names where appropriate. There are also 39 maps showing the
known ranges of a number of species and races. The ecology of each species
and race is touched upon, and most accounts conclude by referring to the
known breeding season of the bird in southern Mozambique and/or a close-
by area.
The author, also an accomplished artist, painted the 48 colour plates,
plus the cover illustration showing the Purple-crested and Livingstone's
Touracos. The majority of plates show just a single species, the others
show two, all of them in naturalistic settings. Those portrayed include such
familiar species as the Jackass Penguin, Black and Saddle-billed Storks,

and Lemon-breasted Canary, which are confined mainly to southern
Mozambique, with just a slight overlap into adjacent territories.
As so few birds are illustrated and there are no descriptions of them,
this book cannot really be used as a field guide or for other identification
purposes, except in conjunction with Ian Sinclair's Field Guide to the Birds
of Southern Africa, Roberts' Birds of South Africa or one of the other South
African guides. It is obviously a very well researched, scholarly work,
which so long as you do not want to use it for identification purposes, will
provide you with most if not all of the other information that you are likely
to want to know about the birds and ornithological history of southern
Mozambique.

This 44-page booklet (illustrated with black and white drawings)
published in March 1997 is the second in a series of husbandry manuals
(the first being on the Luzon Bleeding-Heart Pigeon Gallicolumba /.
luzonica )
In the Introduction (pp 3-4), the author mentions that the manual has
been developed in an attempt to provide the avicultural community with
some guidelines to the keeping and successful breeding of the Pictorella
Mannikin. It is also mentioned that 'the information contained is primary
based upon literature published in popular avicultural texts and journals
dating back to the 1950's.' This is not strictly true as three of the publications
quoted from are in fact either ornithological reference books and/or general
Australian (wild) bird books.
The author also mentions that certain information between different
aviculturists is often conflicting, thus illustrating the point that there should
never be only one way of achieving success in the breeding of birds, and
because of this information contained in the manual should not be deemed
as definitive.
As will be seen from the title of the booklet, the scientific name given to
the Pictorella Mannikin differs from the one usually associated with this
species in that ' Heteromunia&amp;apos;' is used rather than ' Lonchura\ The former

Pages 7=11 of the booklet give details of the Pictorella in the wild. It
appears that as with the Gouldian Finch (Rowland suggests Erythrura rather
than the more often used Chloebia gouldiae ), the Pictorella is susceptible
to air- sac mite Infestations and it is estimated that 62% of the wild population
is affected.
Pages 12=38 deal with captive husbandry, including health requirements,
behaviour, diet, and breeding. Unfortunately, only references to captive
care under Australian conditions are discussed. Indeed the author does not
refer to writings outside of Australia at all. This, to my mind, limits the
usefulness of the booklet to enthusiasts worldwide, as few (especially in the
UK and Europe as a whole) are able to emulate the conditions used by
Australian aviculturists.
A problem which can often occur when an author collates material
from different sources, is that incorrect information can be continually passed
on. The author (pp 8 and 21) states that the Pictorella is the only Australian
finch which does not allopreen. This observation, which is incorrect, was
taken from the Finch Breeders Handbook , Volume 1, The Australians,
published in 1987 by the Queensland Finch Society. Both the Painted
Firetail Emblema pictum and the Gouldian Finch are also non-contact birds.
The author mentions that he aims to supplement and revise the booklet
in the future, perhaps he will rectify the above incorrect information and,
what is more important to enthusiasts outside of Australia, also give details
of captive-breeding procedure elsewhere in the world.

International A vie ultu lists' Society Proceedings
The International Aviculturists' Society, based in the USA, holds a
convention annually in Florida. It is mainly parrot orientated. These
conventions have come to be regarded as the finest of their kind. For the
benefit of those unable to attend - and because it is impossible to remember all
one has heard there - the published Proceedings are offered for sale in ring
binders. Some of the world's leading breeders and vets gathered for the meeting
held last January and their collective wisdom is of enormous practical value.
Parrot aviculture, also the care of pet birds, are the main themes. From the
pages of the Proceedings one can pick up numerous hints. John Goss of
Florida (originally from the UK) mentioned that he changes the hoses used
for cleaning his cages and buildings twice annually. This is because bacterial
growth can build up to a dangerous level inside a hose in a location where the
humidity is high. He gave another useful tip. To save time in washing and
disinfecting containers used for parrot chicks being hand-reared, he places
them in cardboard gift boxes of various sizes. They are discarded after use. In
Florida exists one of the world&amp;apos;s largest parrot breeding facilities - Avicultural
Breeding and Research Center (ABRC). Two members of its staff, veterinarian
April Romagnano and Curator, Trent Swigert, spoke at the meeting. April
Romagnano gave the answers to questions which are frequently asked about
artificial incubation. Causes of early embryonic death include improper egg
handling, excess or insufficient heat or humidity, excessive vibrations, improper
egg turning or poor ventilation. A healthy developing parrot egg should lose
15% to 17% of its water weight by diffusion during incubation. Malposition
and inadequate moisture loss are among the most common causes of embryo
mortality. In 1996 over 1,100 chicks of 45 species (mostly Psittacines) were
hatched at ABRC. Many of the breeding birds were reared in the collection.
One of the most valuable items in the Proceedings is a table showing the year
of hatching of first generation offspring and the year in which the female first
laid (or the male was productive). For example, females laid at the following
ages: two Bare-eyeds laid first at three years, Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoos
at four and five years, Roseate Cockatoos at three, three, four, four, five and
eight years, two Red-tailed Black Cockatoos at four years, Eclectus ( vosmaeri )
at two, three and five years and Blue and Yellow Macaws at four, four, five,
six, six and seven years. Veterinarian Fern Van Sant, in a paper on zinc and
parrots, warned of the dangers of powder-coated cages. Most powder-coatings
do not contain zinc but some do to give a harder finish. This is, of course,
poisonous to parrots. Feather plucking can result when birds ingest zinc.
The Proceedings cost #20 plus #10 postage to the UK, from Luanne Porter,
IAS, PO Box 2232, LaBelle, Florida 33975, USA, (Fax: 001 941 675 8824.)

RARE VIETNAMESE PHEASANT BRED IN THE UK

<bodyText confidence="0.99899" page_id="56293901"  page_num="44" year="" vol="">
The rare Vietnamese Pheasant Lophura hatinensis from the lowland
forests of Vietnam has been bred for the first time in the UK. Discovered
in 1965 by Professor Dang and described in 1975 by Professor Vo Quyr, it
was first bred in captivity in 1993 at Hanoi Zoo. The UK birds were sent
from there on loan to the World Pheasant Trust, and are kept at a member's
aviaries in the south of England, where the first chick of this species ever
hatched outside of Vietnam chipped its way out of the egg on 20th February
1997. There are three closely related rare pheasants in Vietnam which are
currently the subject of research by the World Pheasant Association, Birdlife
International and the WWF. These are Edwards's Pheasant L. edwardsi,
the Imperial Pheasant L. imperialis and the Vietnamese Pheasant. The first
two were first brought into captivity in 1924 by the late Jean Delacour.
From this initial import some 800 or more Edwards's Pheasants are living
in captivity today. The species was thought to be extinct in the wild, but in
recent months five have been trapped by local people .

He became Curator of Sea World in San Diego in 1972 and by mid-
1988 had 1,300 penguins of nine species, three of these species self-
sustaining populations, in Seaworld's four facilities. In addition to his
successes with penguins and waterfowl, Frank Todd developed the most

Magpie Pica pica numbers in farmland and woodland areas of Britain
have more than trebled since 1964. The increase on arable farmland is less
and magpies are found there in lower densities than on mixed and grazed
farmland. The decline in songbirds however has been most marked on
arable farmland, where the magpies are in their lowest numbers. This
suggests that the magpie may not be the only factor affecting songbird
numbers as has been suggested.

A TALE OF TWO HUMMINGBIRDS
The Juan Fernandez Firecrown Sephanoidesfernandensis, a little known
hummingbird could, according to Fauna &amp; Flora News, become extinct by
the year 2000, if its current rate of decline continues and no conservation
measures are taken. Only 250 remain on just one seriously degraded island
in the Juan Fernandez Archipelago, Chile. Its main hope of survival rests
with a joint British, Austrian and Chilean team which is visiting the island
to collect biological and ecological data to help formulate appropriate
conservation measures. In Cage &amp; Aviary Birds (11th January 1997), Kevin
Casey described breeding the Purple-collared Woodstar Myrtis fanny. Four
young, two in each brood, were raised successfully in the UK during 1996.

HOOPOE BREEDING PROJECT

Hoopoes Upupa epops bred at Hare wood Bird Garden near Leeds,
Yorkshire between 1991 - 1994 are now represented in a number of UK
collections, both public and private. But while the population grew steadily
over the period, during the last two years it declined and now numbers
nine males and 11 females distributed between Harewood, Leeds Castle
(Kent), Paradise Park (Cornwall), Paignton Zoo (Devon) and Birdworld
(Surrey). Harewood's Curator, Jim Irwin-Davis and Research Assistant,
Gavin Sweet have been attempting to co-ordinate details of breeding activity
among birds in these collections and their efforts have now resulted in the
publication of a preliminary studbook for the species in Britain. Details
from 1991 are included and they account for 107 birds in 13 collections,
including six founders.
All males have now been paired and it is hoped the downward trend
may be reversed this year. An early report from Leeds Castle stated that
one of its pairs had a large clutch of eggs. The database is maintained on
SPARKS and efforts are being made to ensure that no further genetic
diversity is lost from this small population. It is obvious that fresh bloodlines
are needed to improve existing UK stocks and increase the number of birds
to a point where it will be possible to manage a sustainable captive
population. Aviculturists who keep Hoopoes are invited to contact Gavin

Contractors stopped work on a new signal mast on Stafford Station,
because it would have meant disturbing a Mallard duck Anas platyrhynchos
sitting on its nest containing six eggs. Because of this the mast was moved
a short distance away so as not to disturb the sitting bird and to allow work
to continue on the #2 million upgrading of the Royal Mail depot at Stafford,
adjacent to the main railway lines to and from London and Scotland.
A pair of Ravens Corvus corax hatched three young in a nest on Chester
Cathedral. A closed-circuit television camera provided close-up views of
the nest via screens in the cathedral and the local Tourist Information Centre.
Last year the pair nested on a ledge on Chester's Town Hall, opposite the
cathedral.
The item about the Ravens came from Frank Woolham, and the item
about the duck came from the Staffordshire Sentinel , and was sent by Robert

always an innocent pastime. According to a report in Australian Aviculture,
it resulted in a three year jail sentence for a Perth bird keeper. He painted
some Indian Ring-necks Psittacula krameri with coloured dye so that they
resembled the sought-after cinnamon mutation. A Perth bird dealer paid
A$28,000 for three pairs. A Queensland bird breeder then bought a pair
for A$ 13,000. When the bogus breeder of the mutation tried to sell a fourth
pair, an associate informed the police about his fraudulent activities. A
closer inspection of the dyed birds revealed a 'perfect paint job' except for
one feather under one wing of one of the parrakeets.

Rotterdam, Holland. His father Wessel Cornelis Duijzend had chosen to
settle in Rotterdam because his business involved ornamental and exotic
animals. The major part of the business was with the great zoos of Europe,
including those at Hamburg, Basel and Milan. Pieter was his father's only
son and accompanied him when boats landed animals from Asia and Africa.
Many of these were quarantined in the former 'Old Zoo of Rotterdam'.
Pieter's mother had a shop where she sold small tropical birds, reptiles and
animal foods.
Pieter chose to specialise in game and ornamental pheasants and
waterfowl. In 1930 he had a house built in Zeist, where in the surrounding
grounds he had dug several ponds in order to breed waterfowl. In 1937 his
pheasant aviaries extended for 125m (approx.410ft). He possessed 15
species, among them Lophura and Syrmaticus spp., as well as Phasianus
colchicus, P. c. torquatus and P versicolor. He also published his first
book (in Dutch) The Keeping and Breeding of Pheasants. Before World
War II he also kept 70 species of ducks and six different swans. After the
war some 40 ducks remained.
Pieter wrote articles for the Dutch magazine Avicultura, and was
acquainted with Jean Delacour. The Marquis of Tavistock and Jean Delacour
visited Pieter and his father at Zeist. The firm of W.C. Duijzend existed
until 1970, just five years short of its hundredth anniversary. Pieter's
grandfather, who died in 1907, started out selling canaries and practised
taxidermy at the University of Groninguen. From 1977-1983 Pieter assisted
his daughter in setting up a new ornamental garden near Amersfoort.
The following item appeared in News &amp; Views, Vo 1.81, No.4, p. 231,
1975:-
'Mr P. Duijzend, a member of the Society since 1927, writes from
Leersum, Holland, to say that a female South African Shelduck Tadorna
cana which he acquired in 1928 died in June this year. It was one of 15
which his father imported from Pretoria; some were sent to Cleres and the
rest kept by Mr. Duijzend and successfully bred from. This original female
survived the war and other vicissitudes including blindness in her old age
and Mr. Duijzend wonders whether 47 years is a longevity record for this
species'.
Just as the magazine was about to be printed, came the sad news of the
death of Pieter Duijzend s widow, Fredrika Jacoba Duijzend-van Baarle.
The Avicultural Society offers its condolences to their daughter Nannette
Dijkdrenth-Duijzend.

Robin Restall, author and illustrator of the recently published Munias
and Mannikins, reviewed in this magazine, is now working on two new
books, also to be published by Pica Press in the UK and Yale University
Press in the USA. The first will cover the New World sub-family Cardinalinae,
that is the cardinals, saltators, grosbeaks mdPasserina buntings. The second
will cover a group of New World emberizids, Sporophila, Oryzoborus,
Catamenia, Tiaris, Loxigilla and Loxipasser. These handbooks will contains
as much original personal observations (written and illustrated) as possible,
and, like the munias book will show every known plumage in colour. This
means adult males of every race, and females, immatures and moults where
distinct. There will also be a set of measured drawings of many individual
birds. The distribution maps will show political boundaries, major river
systems and probably key elevations.
Robin lives in Caracas where he has a large garden aviary and a small
outdoor birdroom. He has a few Sporophila and Oryzoborus at the present,
and is travelling extensively to make comparative field observations about
these birds, many of which occur in Venezuela.
He would very much like to build a network of people interested in any
of the species that are in the two groups described above, to exchange
experiences, news and views. If you have seen Munias and Mannikins, you
will understand how avicultural experience can provide invaluable insights
into behaviour, and thus contribute to and enrich a handbook on birds. Every
correspondent will be respected, and every contribution will be fully
acknowledged in the printed work. Any aviculturist who corresponded with
Robin during the development of the munias book will vouch for the fact
that this is a give and take offer.

Last year (1996) marked a quarter of a century during which Ruth Ezra,
President of the Avicultural Society, and I have enjoyed keeping our joint
collection here at Chestnut Lodge, Cobham, Surrey. Numerous breedings
have taken place, including 14 which are believed to be UK first breedings,
along with several UK second breedings and numerous others. Of the
many families, it is the waders with which we have been the most successful.
Several have been sustained breedings over many years. Possibly our best
year so far was 1992.
These notes aim to provide as much information as possible, although
unfortunately in the case of several of the smaller birds it is difficult to
write a great deal about the breedings as the nests were sometimes too
small to observe or we thought it best to leave the birds alone and not
disturb them. I have separated the feeding and describe it before the breeding
as generally in the large flights the birds have a variety of foods available
and will take a selection of those offered.
With regard to the aviaries, these notes are best read in conjunction
with those that appeared in the Avicultural Magazine , 101, 4: 187-191,
covering my talk at the Centenary Celebrations, which was illustrated with
a selection of slides. The aviaries here at Cobham are of many shapes and
sizes, and of various heights. They are generally landscaped and planted
to blend in with various trees and plants etc. One problem has been that
the growth is at times very vigorous and nowadays the vegetation has to be
pruned back otherwise it would be difficult to see the birds. Subtle alterations
have been made to some of the flights but basically they have remained
unaltered since they were constructed. The present lay-out took about 20
years to complete. At all times the birds come first and all are encouraged
to breed.
Correct feeding is a vital part of breeding. Being in mixed aviaries
with a large variety of foods available means that many of the birds have
the chance to sample a wider variety of foods than otherwise might be
available to them. Most aviaries have a supply of nectar and in some aviaries

there is more than one type. Hanging parrots and lories have a Lory nectar.
There are now many nectar preparations available, all claiming to be the
best and containing their own particular combination of ingredients. We
mix our own and provide it in open dishes, except in the case of the more
delicate nectar-feeders such as the hummingbirds, sunbirds and sugarbirds,
for which we use hanging bottles. Over the years nectars have changed as
research has improved, though even now too rich a nectar can be bad for
some birds and may cause liver problems. How appropriate it is that Ruth's
father, Alfred Ezra, was the first to develop a nectar mixture on which
birds thrived - it included Nestles condensed milk, Mellin's Food and sugar
- and some of the hummingbirds fed on it lived for up to eight years in his
collection.
I am often asked about my softbill/insectivorous food. I use a mixture
of Haith's Prosecto Insectivorous Food and Bogena, and sometimes others
which vary from time to time. At present I am also using Witte Molen and
high protein chick starter crumbs. Once again the varieties available are
increasing all the time and there are now even specially formulated diets
for touracos and hornbills. What I have done for years is also use hard-
boiled eggs with them. I am a great believer in that it puts body into birds.
We use the entire egg including the shell, which we mix together in our
machine. There are few birds which do not take some of this. It is mixed
with the softbill mixture, sprinkled with Vionate (one of the vitamin
supplements we use), and fed to the birds daily. Anything left over the
next day is taken away just in case it may start to go off and is given to the
cranes. I also use ox heart which is mixed in with the insectivorous food.
Again I am a great believer in this. The art is to provide just enough food,
so that there is a little left the next morning. All too often you see dishes
full up and know that the birds have been given enough food to last all
week. When we have a new keeper, one of our first tasks is to teach him or
her how to judge the correct amount of food to give to the birds.
I use a wide variety of fruits most of which are cut-up but some are
chopped in our machine. Certain fruits such as grapes, apples and pears
are used all year round but others are used only seasonally. I do not use
oranges and never have. Also, whereas a lot of people put fruit on spikes,
I do not. Any uneaten fruit is removed the next day. Here again the art is
to have just a little left over the next morning.
Once livefood consisted of only maggots and mealworms, but maggots
are no longer used since the problems with botulism in the 1970s.
Nowadays, I use as great a variety of livefood as I can obtain. What a
difference mini mealworms have made to successful rearing, especially
during those first few days. At one time we could buy ants' eggs
commercially, but this was a long time ago.

Most of my seed comes from Haith's. With large parrots such as macaws
and Keas Nestor notabilis I use small quantities of sunflower seed and give
them plenty of fresh fruit and nuts. The Scarlet Ibis Eudocimus ruber have
carophyll added to their food during the moult so as to maintain their colour.
I use a proprietary diet for the flamingos. The waterfowl have their own
food, consisting of wheat, pellets, bread and sea duck food, and seem to
thrive on it, as do all the wild ducks, which all seem to know when it is
feeding time.
It is wonderful to see the iridescent plumage of the Emerald Starling
Lamprotornis iris when the sun catches it. It is a quite spectacular and
breathtaking bird. I first saw this starling in 1954, when David
Attenborough returned from the Zoo Quest Expedition to Sierra Leone,
West Africa, with 26. There is a colour plate by David Reid Henry in the
Avicultural Magazine , 61, 6:261, and notes by my good friend the late
John Yealland. Those brought back were mostly in immature plumage but
those depicted in the colour plate are in adult plumage. One pair went to
M. Delacour and another pair to Mr. Ezra. The rest were retained by
London Zoo. I was not fortunate enough to obtain any at the time, but
eventually one came into my collection and lived for many years. It was
brought back with other birds from Sierra Leone by Ray Shingler, who had
been a keeper at London Zoo.
Many years later, in 1979, a dealer rang me to say that he had some
interesting starlings including the Emerald. I almost had a fit, for these
were the first that had ever been offered for sale. I went at once and bought
four or six, which was all I could get, They were placed in a large aviary
and the next year (1980), I was extremely excited when two young were
reared. It was the first time that this species had been bred in the UK.
Emerald Starlings are a flock or colony bird and it is possible to keep
several together in a large aviary. A breeding pair will become dominant
but given plenty of space in a planted aviary the others will be safe. Emerald
Starlings often carry green leaves in their bills, but I remain uncertain
whether this is for display purposes or nesting. They have bred for us here
at Cobham several times since though not on a regular basis. The nest-box
is generally one of the sloping-type, but with a flat bottom and with wire-
mesh on the inside to assist the birds to get in and out. The eggs are typical
starling eggs, that is mainly light blue with brown/red blotching.
Emerald Starlings appear to withstand our climate pretty well. They
are highly nervous when first received. They do not make good show birds
as they spend their time on the floor of the cage and their plumage gets
soiled. The same thing happens in quarantine and at dealers' premises
and this can result in them picking up infections. When I obtained my first
ones they were not perfect, but nothing was seriously wrong with them.
They bathed extensively at first which as you know happens with a lot of

birds when you first get them. During this period the water should be
changed each time after they have bathed, as dirty water can lead to the
spread of infection. I find bathing to be a sign of a good healthy bird and
mine continue to bath regularly in almost all the different types of weather
that we experience here in England.
The breeding of the Splendid Starling L. splendidus has already been
the subject of an article in the Avicultural Magazine , 88, 4:189-190,
illustrated with a colour plate by Richard Daniel. My original pair came
from Mr. &amp; Mrs T. J. Barnley, near Kitale, western Kenya, which is at the
eastern limit of the range of this principally West African species. I must
say that this species' name is most appropriate. It is one of the few starlings
that is easily sexable, the male being more brightly coloured and larger
than the female. They first bred here in 1976, and we were awarded the
Society's medal for the first breeding in this country. However, M. Delacour
had bred them two years earlier at Cleres, which was probably the first ever
captive breeding. Over the first few years the Cobham pair regularly
produced young, but then they were stolen and were never recovered. I
was able to obtain others and have had occasional successes since including
in 1992, when one was hand-reared. Patrick Taplin, a keeper at the time,
put a great deal of time and effort into raising it. Whereas the Superb
Starling Spreo superbus readily goes to nest, albeit not always rearing the
young, the Splendid Starling will carry green leaves around the aviary
perhaps even building an incomplete nest, but nowadays seldom seems to
lay fertile eggs. This is in marked contrast to my original pair which
hatched every egg they laid and reared all the young. There are still six
here at Cobham and I know of a few others in bird gardens and private
collections and, hopefully, these will form the nucleus of a breeding
programme.
Superb Starlings bred at Cobham in 1996. The Royal or Golden-breasted
Starlings Cosmopsarus regius though have yet to be completely successful.
This beautiful starling has had young about to leave the nest only to let
them die. Royal Starlings are very prone to gape worm infections and
precautions need to be taken when they are newly imported. However,
once they are established they do well even in our damp autumns. Amethyst
or Violet-backed Starlings Cinnyricinclus leucogaster have also had young
about to fledge. Here again this starling is sexable, although mistakes
occur sometimes because young males can take up to three years to lose
their female-like immature plumage.
American Black-necked Stilts Himantopus mexicanus bred here first
in 1992, which was another UK first breeding. At present they breed in
our two large aviaries. They feed on mixed insectivorous food, minced ox
heart and, when we could obtain them, sand eels, which are no longer

available. During the breeding season the male gets a pink flush on his
breast (which may not be noticeable in the wild) and this is a sign that he is
coming into breeding condition. The display before they mate is wonderful
- they looked like ballet dancers - it is really quite spectacular. The male
dances around the female and then suddenly they mate. When they bred
here in 1992, it was only their second year here. The original pair have yet
to lay an infertile egg. Each nest has four eggs which all hatch and all the
chicks are reared. There are drawbacks though when they are breeding, as
they are not easy birds to keep in a mixed aviary. Once they have young all
the other waders have to be removed and they will even fly up and attack
birds sitting on the perches. They are wonderful parents which dote on
their chicks and have become one of my favourite waders, but it is necessary
to keep a careful watch on them. Their eggs have a speckled, dull green
background colour, with mottled brown markings. They have a single
clutch and have nested in the same place each year for the past five years.
The aviary which was known as the Cock-of-the-Rock aviary, has a stream
running through it. It is the same aviary in which the Black-winged Stilts
H. himatopus nested so successfully. They first bred in 1979, which was
another UK first breeding. I believe that the Black-necked species is the
prettier and more attractive of the two. The Black-winged Stilts received
the same diet, but some of them got a gout-like condition in their toes
which could cause lameness. Both species are very hardy and will stand in
running water when roosting during the winter. As it is always running,
the water does not freeze and its temperature is above that of the cold night
air. If the water froze then there would almost certainly be problems. In
the summer they roost on the ground.
To my surprise and great pleasure, a pair hatched the previous season,
successfully reared chicks in their first year. I was surprised that they
matured so quickly. I have disposed of the Black-winged species and for a
few years now have kept only Black-necked Stilts. These can be disposed
of without permission and no paperwork is needed, whereas this is not the
case with the Black-winged species. Most people who know me know how
I dislike paperwork, and this is why I no longer keep Black-winged Stilts.
I would say that stilts need an aviary not less than 6m x 3m (approx,
20ft x 10ft), with a constant trickle of running water. They carry their food
into the water to wash it and if the water is still, an oily film quickly develops
on the surface and this causes feather problems. Some of my birds which
have gone to other aviculturists have had this problem, but as soon as running
water was introduced it disappeared. Sexing is not difficult as the male has
a more intense black on the back, with a shine to the feathers, whereas the
female's back has a brownish tinge. The young that bred in 1996 could be
sexed fairly early on, but generally it takes a year before you can be certain.

This young pair went together very quickly and became aggressive to their
nest mates and these had to be removed.
Avocets Recurvirostra avocetta breed regularly here at Cobham. It is
most gratifying for first time visitors to admire these birds that are once
again breeding in considerable numbers in this country. Avocets must be
surgically sexed to ensure that you have a true pair. Even this method is
not one hundred percent accurate, as I once had 'a pair' resexed, only to
find that both were the same sex. Once again, when they have young,
Avocets will dominate their flight, so the entire family is put into a side
aviary. It is easy to hand net them, even with other birds nesting. Many
members who have visited us will have noticed that the grass is always cut
around where the waders nest. Once they get used to the mower, they
appear to have no fear of it. The same thing happens in the grounds with
our cranes, which we are able to go right up to with the mower.
The Wattled Jagana Jacana jacana was bred here in 1994, which was
possibly a first ever breeding. This is the South American species which
has a yellow bill, a red frontal shield and wattles; the outer primaries are
yellow and the legs and feet are dusky green. Jaganas or lilytrotters need
the right conditions and if provided with them they will thrive, but if they
are kept in poor conditions foot problems are inevitable. My pair bred in
the waterfall aviary which housed birds up to the size of the Purple-throated
Fruitcrow Querula purpurata. This jagana is much tougher than the African
Jagana Actophilornis africanus, although in a bad winter it ought to be put
inside at night. We were usually able to walk them in and sometimes they
were intelligent enough to walk in on their own. The most fascinating
thing about the breeding was that the male did all the work, which as you
know is most unusual with birds. He built the nest with only partial
assistance from the female and sat all the time. I never saw the female on
the nest. When the chicks hatched he carried them in his breast feathers
and at first glance they looked like bumble bees with matchstick-like legs.
The female stayed in the background, but if a Sparrow Hawk Accipiter
nisus appeared on or above the aviary, she would come forward and attempt
to defend them. Apart from this she did nothing and the male almost
appeared to resent her coming too close to defend the chicks or interfere
with them. In the centre of the pond there are rocks and also lilies and
blanket weed, and it was here that the nest was built. The eggs were a
beautiful shining bronze colour. Sexing was very easy as the female is
larger than the male. The young could be sexed by their size and this was
confirmed about 18 months later when they attained full colour. Although
they are not aggressive like stilts and avocets, they did drive off the old
jaganas that I had in the aviary, and they had to be removed. Four young
were reared in 1994 and three in 1995. I tried the tiny chicks with a dish of

mini mealworms, but am uncertain what they ate at first, however, within
a few days the mini mealworms were being taken. At present there is a
single African Ja 9 ana here, which is an aggressive bird. As I implied before,
I believe that the Wattled Jagana is much superior and hardier. Getting the
young meated-off was not too difficult. We had to mix livefood with the
softbill food and then be patient. The main problem is that it is expensive
to supply unlimited livefood in a large mixed aviary.
The White-breasted Rail Laterallus leucophyrrhus , also known as the
Red and White Crake, is a bird that needs some notes written about it,
some of them for the wrong reasons. They can be very aggressive, and at
times, can be difficult to keep together. I imported a few to go in with our
group, but all the new ones were killed by the next morning, which shows
how aggressive they can be. In a large planted aviary with plenty of cover
in which to hide they will be happy, as every so often one or more will get
picked on and will need somewhere to hide. This problem of introducing
new birds or a new bird into an established group applies to various species.
Surgical sexing is not easy with such small birds - just 18cm (Tin) long -
and I have had examples that have needed the 'kiss of life' when they
stopped breathing and had to be pumped to get them going again. They
nest in quite extraordinary places such as quite high up in bushes and in
half-open-fronted nest-boxes. We have bred them several times and once
again, the young of this South American species are enchanting. As I have
already said. White-breasted Rails climb all over the place, one minute
they are on the ground and the next they are at the top of a bush. They have
been accused of being egg-eaters, but I have not found this to be the case.
Mine were good parents, I say this in the past tense, as I now have only two
left. They are not breeding and as there are no more available, it may be
the last time we see them in our aviaries. They eat fruit and softbill food
etc., and also seeds, including various millets.
Roulroul Partridges Rollulus roulroul appear to breed well for only a
short time, say up to about three years, and then seem to do nothing. In
1956, when I lived in London, I recorded the second UK breeding. The
chicks were parent-reared and the following year a Silky brooded and reared
the young. At that year's National Exhibition of Cage Birds, held at the
Olympia, London, I won the award for the Best Foreign Exhibit with the
male and one of his daughters. It was the first time that a pair of English-
bred foreign birds had been awarded 'Best Foreign' at what was then our
premier exhibition of foreign birds. To the best of my knowledge this also
includes the Crystal Palace shows going all the way back into the last century.
Here at Cobham I have had several pairs that have bred. My latest pair will
not sit on their eggs. I believe there is a strong possibility that they are not
parent-reared and in my opinion this causes problems with both infertility

and rearing. Several aviculturists have had fleeting success with a pair or
two after which nothing further happened. Most successes appear to be as
a result of taking the eggs away to be hatched and artificially rearing the
chicks. You seem to end up with an egg layer which does not know how to
sit and incubate her own eggs. My original pair were wild caught and they
were serious nesters. This latest pair which are captive bred play with
nesting material but never make a proper dome-shaped nest. In 1996 the
eggs were taken away and placed in an incubator, and five hatched and the
chicks were hand-reared. They were raised under a lamp along with a
domestic hen's chick to keep them company. I have found that the Roulroul
Partridge does not like cold weather and gets frost bitten toes if subjected to
low temperatures. In our climate it definitely needs some form of a shelter.
This is another bird that does better kept in a glass-covered, as opposed to
an open aviary, in which I have experienced problems with them. They are
usually okay outside from April to October.
Rothschild's Mynahs Leucopsar rothschildi have bred here in the past
(using a slanting nest-box), but nowadays it is becoming increasingly
difficult to get the parents to rear their young. This is similar to what has
happened with the Roulroul Partridge. The mynahs are very striking birds
but for some reason have developed the habit of plucking their throat
feathers.
In 1984 we achieved the UK first breeding of the West African Violaceous
Touraco Musophaga violacea. They went on to breed for several years,
with their nesting receptacle being a wire-basket, against a wall, in a bush.
There they made a dove-like nest from a few twigs. Their diet consisted of
diced fruit with added vitamins. Touracos can get liver problems and
recently a low iron fruit softbill food has been marketed by Witte Molen,
which my touracos now accept. The young seem to leave the nest awfully
early and will climb about on the branches of bushes. They remind me of
the South American Hoatzin Opisthocomus hoazin when they do this, but
not at other times. I did not find them aggressive until recently when
breeding. I now have a female that absolutely hates women and will attack
our female keeper. This bird is not frightened by anyone and remains right
up close to the wire of her flight as you walk past. Ross's Touraco M. rossae
has also bred here. Slightly larger than the Violaceous, it is not imported
so often nowadays. My friend Newton-Steele described the first breeding
in 1972 ( Avicultural Magazine, 79, 1: 30-34), for which he was awarded
the Society's medal. His pair were extremely aggressive and the male took
out one of the female's eyes. Touracos can be very aggressive towards each
other, especially when they are kept in a small flight. They do need to be
watched when they are breeding, as the males will sometimes persecute the
females. We breed the Pink-crested species Tauraco erythrolophus most

years. We have also bred Livingstone's T. corythaix livingstonii which
nests in a box, and have bred Schalow's T. c. schalowi and achieved the
second breeding of Fischer's Touraco T. c.fischeri , one of the young of
which is now living in the collection at Leeds Castle. With touracos surgical
sexing is the best way of establishing pairs, or you can let them pick their
own partners.
The Blue Whistling Thrush Myiophoneus caeruleus is a very attractive
bird which in a good light appears spotted all over with glistening blue,
and has the habit of flicking and fanning its tail. However, they can at
times be killers and are not to be trusted with birds smaller than themselves,
or even birds of their own size, which is about 33cm (13in) long. They
were even aggressive towards the Scarlet Ibis . They bred here successfully
in 1992 (which was another UK first breeding), when they built a typical
thrush nest but larger than usual, due to their larger size. They bred several
more times, with the young leaving the nest looking like paler versions of
their parents. When nesting the female would attack the keepers and
eventually killed the male whistling thrush. It is definitely a species to
keep a close eye on, even if there are just a pair on their own in a spacious
flight. I have noticed that yellow-billed birds are no longer imported,
whereas those with black bills continue to be imported occasionally.
The Island Thrush Turdus poliocephalus inhabits numerous south-east
Asian islands. The male has a white head, otherwise it is basically a brown
bird with a black back, and is similar in shape and size to the European
Blackbird T. merula . I had a pair of Island Thrushes and then obtained
some more and eventually had a male and two females in the same aviary.
First one female nested and successfully reared young and then to my utter
amazement the second female did the same - the male had mated with both
females. They nested in half-open-fronted nest-boxes, which is not normal
for thrushes. It is believed to be the UK first breeding of this species.
Kookaburras Dacelo novaeguineae have over the years often bred here.
Members who have visited us will remember that they bred first in a small
enclosure by the garages. Mice and day-old chicks formed the bulk of their
diet. You can sex them by sight, but this is not always easy. My present
pair are still young.
Azure-winged Magpies Cyanopica cyana have bred here on several
occasions in recent years. I have in the past kept them in a flock and this
seemed to galvanise them into breeding. After cutting back in 1996,1 now
have only two pairs, one of which reared five young in the lakeside aviary.
They are not too aggressive, but it is best to keep them with species of a
similar size to themselves. Actually, when they moult their tail feathers,
they are quite small birds.
The Red-tailed Siva Minla ignotincta bred in 1989 in one of the range
of six smaller aviaries. This Asiatic species has a black head with a white

eye-stripe, a brown back, a yellow belly and a red tail. If it was not for its
red tail it would be a difficult bird to spot in a planted flight, I cannot report
much about the breeding of this species. They were thought to be sitting,
then livefood was taken to the nest and eventually two young were seen in
the flight. Of the other two sivas, the Blue-winged M. cyanouroptera is a
rather highly strung bird, whereas the Chestnut-tailed M. strigula is very
confiding. Of the three, only the Red-tailed is sexable. Several others
have been successful with it in recent years. This species had not been seen
in England for many years. In the March 1915 issue of Bird Notes , the
magazine of the Foreign Bird Club, there is a coloured plate of it painted
by Goodchild. It was painted from life from a male owned by Ruth's father,
Alfred Ezra. He described the bird as the most fascinating of the softbilled
birds that he had kept. It was full of curiosity and not at all frightened.
This I can confirm.
A similar story has to be told of the Southern Tit Warblers Parisoma
subcaeruleum , which were sold as Tit-Babblers, which is their South African
name. These small African warblers are mainly grey, with the chin and
throat white streaked with black, and have chestnut undertail-coverts. To
start with I kept them in one of the six small flights, where in 1989 they
built a small compact nest and reared two young. The sexes look alike and
the young when they left the nest were merely duller versions of their parents.

1988, rearing three young each time. Once again they bred in one of the
six small flights where they nested in a thick currant bush. I did not know
that they were nesting until the male went for Alan Lewis their keeper.
Others have since been successful with this species. It is a well known bird
found from the Himalayas to northern Thailand and western China. The
male is basically a dark bluish-slate, with a brightly coloured chestnut tail.
The female is greyish-brown, with a white and brown tail. Often pictured
in or near water, this species enjoys access to a stream or pond, if possible.
The Black-masked Crimson Tanagers Ramphocelus nigrogularis from
the Andes were successful in 1992, once again in the range of six flights.
Although the aviaries have heated shelters this species will withstand cold
weather. What it does not like is damp autumn weather. This can be said
of a great many birds. The pair nested in an open-fronted finch-type box
and were tolerant of the other aviary inmates. They took a lot of livefood
while nesting. Basically black and red birds, they are very striking when
viewed for the first time. The female is a duller version of the male and the
young are duller versions of their parents. The Black-cheeked Woodpeckers
Melanerpes pucherani from central and northern South America have,
since the first UK breeding in 1992, been successful on numerous occasions
including in 1996. Again the breeding has taken place in one of the six

small flights. Not many woodpeckers are imported and few have been bred
in captivity. Over the years I have found that woodpeckers enjoy nectar
and I ensure it is available to them. In 1954 I wrote a letter about a Cuban
Black-browed Woodpecker Centurus superciliaris, noting the fact that it
was fond of the sunbird's nectar. The sexes of the Black-cheeked
Woodpecker are similar with the male having a stronger red cap. The nest
site was a Silver Birch tree trunk cut into three sections for ease of handling
and moveability. Once they have excavated their nest hole, we just have to
wait and hope. I believe that the young are in the nest for about three
weeks, which seems a long time. When we see lots of food being taken into
the log, we know they have young. It is, of course, impossible to see inside.
The log had a small hole and this was where the woodpeckers started to
drill. I made the point earlier, that the young seemed to be in the log for a
long time, and I wondered if it was the parents that were eating all the
livefood. We could not hear any noises coming from inside, but eventually
four young emerged. The male continues to drill even when the female is
sitting. These woodpeckers are now in one of the three covered flights by
the Koi Carp pool. They like fruit, softbill food, livefood and nectar. They
have a Scarlet- chested Sunbird Nectarinia senegalensis sharing their flight,
and it is a pleasure to see the sunbird and a woodpecker drinking from the
same dish of nectar. They are not particularly aggressive and, when they
first bred, had a pair of Black-naped Fruit Doves Ptilinopus melanospila in
the flight with them.
Blue-faced Honeyeaters Entomyzon cyanotis harteri , from southern New
Guinea and northern Queensland, bred here first in 1992. It is a species
which I never expected to see again. In 1960, Chat and Lindsay exhibited
a pair at the National Exhibition of Cage and Aviary Birds at Olympia,
London, where they won their class and eventually won the award for the
Best Large Foreign Softbill. 1 obtained six in 1991. They are kept in an
aviary with a shelter that is heated during the winter. Two pairs nested
though only one pair did so successfully. They nested in a wire basket and
it was not difficult to rear the young which were left with their parents.
The colony was progressing well but when I attempted to introduce more
of them this caused problems. The new birds were resented and were
attacked and had to be removed. This is a common problem with many
birds. Whenever possible I try to obtain four to six birds, especially as most
are not sexable. You breed them and the birds thrive, but eventually one or
more may die. You obtain a replacement or replacements but introducing
them is I find a strain both on me and the birds. If you keep birds in a
birdroom you can put the new bird or birds in a cage and allow them to get
to know each other through the wire. In aviaries, when I do this, I introduce
them into the aviary and watch and pray that the new birds and the old
birds will get on well together. It is usually the first 24 hours that cause

most concern. After this it is when nesting takes place that problems are
most likely to occur. The aggression which starts with lots of calling and
may end with fighting, invariably starts when you are not there.
I had problems with egg eating in 1994 and 1995, so in 1996 when a
single honeyeater egg was seen, it was taken away to be hatched in an
incubator and the chick hand-reared by Sheila Becker. When it was newly
hatched, you could not tell what it was, but when the blue started to break
through on its face, you knew at once it was a Blue-faced Honeyeater. The
chick was fed on the touraco diet, with pawpaw and added vitamins, together
with the squeezed out contents of mealworms and little grubs. The chick
soon learnt to pick up food for itself and all went well. I prefer parent
rearing but in this case there was no choice. With the addition of this
youngster there will be five in the group, so its introduction will not be
easy.
Green Wood Hoopoes Phoeniculus purpureus have been bred before,
the first time in UK being at Winged World at Hey sham, Lancashire. They
are very interesting birds and kept in a large mixed aviary next to the
waterfowl aviary. Four were obtained and very quickly it was obvious that
a pair were nesting. The nest-box was the usual type hung at an angle.
When they were rearing their young an enormous amount of livefood was
being put in to the aviary. Then I hit on an idea, I put Vim (12mm) wire
netting over the top of a large hook-on feeding pot, so that the wood hoopoes
with their long bills were able to take the livefood but it was out of reach of
the other birds. I found them to be very good parents, which made a great
fuss of their young. I also noted that the other two helped them with the
feeding. However, they do not like new inmates in their aviary and can be
murderous to their own kind, if you attempt to introduce newcomers into
the colony. In the case of other species, it is not that they kill them, it is
that they pursue them around the aviary, interfere with nest-boxes and
generally make the new birds feel insecure. Wood hoopoes roost in their
nest-box.
Ringed Plovers Charadrius hiaticula were successful for several years.
I kept the pairs separated and my last pair were excellent parents. They
nested against the wire in the main aviary where the dogs walk up and
down outside during the day. When the dogs did this the plovers would fly
against the wire to try to drive them away. They were great characters and
gave me no problems for they were very protective of their young. Unlike
the stilts, they were not aggressive towards other birds. In 1992, I had
another first breeding, this time with the Masked Plover Vanellus miles
which comes from the south Moluccas, Kei Island, New Guinea and northern
and eastern Australia. This species has a yellow bill and large yellow
wattles, a black crown and nape, and the sides of the head, the neck and
underparts are white. Mine are extraordinarily prolific. There are three

nests a year with 100% fertility. I have had them sitting in the snow and
still be successful, although I much prefer them to nest later in the year, as
the winter days are so very short which is not conducive to good
reproduction. The nest is a scrape in the ground lined with a few twigs.
A great disappointment has been my failure to persuade my pygmy
geese to nest. They display but do nothing else. Mine are African Pygmy
Geese Nettapus auritus. They are the prettiest, but are not free breeders.
Mine may well be the oldest pair in captivity, for they are over ten years old
and this is now beginning to show. My stilts do not bully them even when
they are nesting. They are highly nervous birds. I recently acquired two
more pairs which I have in the waterfall aviary and shut into a shelter at
night if it is at all cold.
Doves have been quite successful here at Cobham. The Black-naped
species has bred now for some six years. The Beautiful Fruit Pigeons
P pulchellus rear a single chick but so far all have been males. The Jambu
P.jambu and Superb P. superbus have also been successful. As you may
know, it is easy to get doves to nest but their nests can be quite literally next
to nothing. A pair of Beautiful nested on a leaf! We stitched a small basket
to the leaf but it was still not successful. It is most important that the fruit
for these doves is chopped very small. It is no good giving them mushy
fruit or half a pear because, if you do, it will get stuck around their beak
and face. With small chopped fruit they can eat it whole and it goes straight
down and they do not get sores in the sides of their mouth. They will also
take livefood such as mealworms, also nectar.
Golden Heart Gallicolumba rufigula and both Luzon and Bartlett's
Bleeding Heart Doves G. luzonica and G. criniger have bred here over the
years. The Luzon lays two eggs and Bartlett's a single egg. My present
pair of Bartlett's have reared six young. These doves like seed, peanuts
and insectivorous food, plus livefood. Doves are not energetic birds and
will sit in the same place for days. However, if they are panicked, they
crash about and untold damage can be done, especially when other birds
are nesting. They can get foot problems when the ground is frozen, so
heated accommodation is advisable in our climate during the winter. It is
also best to house only a single pair of doves in a flight, unless it is
particularly spacious, as especially when they are nesting, they may attack
and kill other doves.
The Black-billed Weaver Ploceus melanogaster is found from eastern
Nigeria to Uganda and western Kenya, where it lives singly or in pairs,
mainly in forest undergrowth. The male's forehead, crown and the sides of
the face are yellow. There is a black streak through the eyes and the rest of
the plumage and the bill are also black. The female has the chin and the
front of the neck yellow, uniform with the sides of the face and the forehead.

It has never been easy to breed weavers and reports of breeding successes
are few and far between. I imported my Black-billed Weavers direct from
Kenya and achieved the UK first breeding with this species in 1976. They
made a typical hanging weaver's nest. When breeding they were totally
insectivorous and never appeared to take any seed. It is now many years
since I kept this species and the chances of ever getting it again must be
very small. The Madagascar Weaver Foudia madagascariensis, which
has always been one of my favourites, bred here several times in the 1980s.
It is a peaceful bird that does well in a colony.
I cannot claim to be well known for breeding parrots but I have had
some successes. Keas, perhaps the most interesting of all parrots, have
bred here most years, always early in the year. A lot of Keas in this country
can be traced back to my original pair. The female came from Jersey Zoo
and the male from New Zealand. The male remains keen on mating, but
they are too old to breed now, for they are probably over 30 years old. 1
have had up to four young in a nest, but on the last occasion there were
only two. When nesting the female gives out a scream if anyone comes
near, otherwise Keas really are secretive when nesting and the female is
sort of guarded by the male. The nest-box is constructed from breeze blocks
with a lid made of paving slabs, so that they have a nest chamber similar to
that which they use in their native New Zealand.
Keas enjoy a very varied diet which includes various nuts, plus fruit,
lettuce and mealworms. You will have heard or read the stories of how
they attack sheep, but I doubt that&amp;apos;they do this. Many parrots will eat meat
and we have all heard stories of pet African Greys Psittacus erithacus
tucking into the Sunday joint and two veg. My good friend the late Sydney
Porter was the first to breed Keas in 1946 and for this got the Society's
medal, which is now in my possession. He visited New Zealand and could
in fact find no evidence that they kill sheep. Keas are very inquisitive and
highly active. His birds played all the time and especially enjoyed playing
with a cup. He had them in an aviary with running water which they liked
to run through. I have often thought that I should put mine into one of my
larger flights.
Although not colourful birds, Keas have wonderful orange feathering
under their wings, which is seen only when they fly. They seem to enjoy
calling at night. Sydney had this problem and got complaints from his
neighbours. He always said that he would dispose of them but they were
still there 20 years after the complaints started. When he died he left his
Keas to me.
When I bred Stella's Lorikeet Charmosyna papou stellae it was for the
first time since E.J. Brooks bred it before World War 1. My pair used a
typical upright box in a small aviary where they could sample fruit and
nectar. These lorikeets love to bath and enjoy rubbing their plumage on

wet leaves after it has been raining. I am not a great believer in covered
aviaries. I was also successful with the Red-flanked Lorikeet C. placentis
but quickly sold the parents when I caught them attacking and eventually
killing a Malayan Crested Jay Platylophus galericulatus and a Blue-breasted
Kingfisher Halcyon malimbica. Most people have had no trouble with
them and others since have been okay. It shows how careful and observant
you need to be. Philippine Hanging Parrots Loriculus philippensis have
bred here on numerous occasions. Some 'disappeared' in 1995 when I had
a small colony. I never did find out what happened to them, although I
have my suspicions. Early last year (1996) the parents left a single chick
on two occasions. Then just when I was considering hand-rearing the
chicks, if the parents nested again, they reared three young.
I have had Salvadori's, Edwards' and Double-eyed Fig Parrots
Psittaculirostris salvadorii, P. edwardsii and Opopsitta diophthalma but
these were not easy to keep alive. I found that they got into beautiful
breeding condition then dropped dead and post mortems failed to reveal
the causes of death. More recently Vitamin K has been found to be beneficial.
London Zoo had a female Double-eyed Fig Parrot in a small box cage for
about 15 years. It was fed on seed (millets, canary seed, sunflower and
hemp), the same nectar as that given to the hummingbirds, sunbirds and
sugarbirds, fruit, insectivorous/softbill food and mealworms. At the time
it was the only fig parrot most people had ever seen. It was one of two
females and a Plicated Hornbill Aceros plicatus brought over by David
Attenborough, along with a consignment of birds of paradise which Sir
Edward Hallstrom presented to the zoo.
Scarlet Ibis were not successful until last year (1996), when a chick was
hand-reared. The flamingos have always looked lovely but only one has
been bred. Vulturine Guineafowl Acryllium vulturinum have been allowed
to wander free and have laid eggs in the grounds and some were hatched. I
can remember my good friend Donald Risdon saying: 'All you have to do
is to catch up the young and their parents and put them in an aviary while
the young grow.' I found that this was not as easy as it sounded and after a
time gave up and left them to their own devices. Some aviculturists find
these birds are susceptible to foot problems. Perhaps this is related to their
diet. It is something I can remember Reg Partridge telling me about.
Cranes are certainly long lived and give immense pleasure. We have
had various species here at Cobham. They always seem to be in peak
condition and love to display on the lawns. As with many such park birds,
surgical sexing is generally required. Probably the best way to breed cranes
would be to have full-winged males were that possible. Pinioned males
may find it difficult to keep their balance when mating. Stanley Cranes
Anthropoides paradisea have been successful here. At present we have a

pet female called 'Emma'. Demoiselle Cranes A. virgo have bred as well,
but sadly, the Crowned Cranes Balearica pavonina have not. In fact, in all
the years they have been here, try as I may, I have never even seen them
mate. Our cranes get corn, pellets and the left-overs from the aviaries.
Of the more unusual pheasants, I must mention the Palawan Peacock
Pheasant Polyplectron emphanum and also the Congo Peafowl Afropavo
congensis , both of which have been reared successfully here at Cobham,
The Palawan lays just a single egg. This species is susceptible to cold and
damp weather. The Congo Peafowl is similarly affected by our climate. I
believe that I was the second person to breed this species in this country,
and was really pleased with this breeding. They were kept in the secluded
aviary where the Choughs Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax are at present. Heat
was provided in their shelter and they could go out at any time and walk
about on the grass. Mine came from Antwerp Zoo, where they were kept
in a very dry environment in sandy pens in order to help prevent disease.
Here they were offered a varied diet and their feather quality started to
improve and a shine returned to their feathers which had started to curl up.
The main problem here was that the two males both burst their main artery
and died immediately. After this occurred for the second time, the female
was sent to London Zoo.
To complete these notes I have to mention an unsuccessful breeding
back in August/September 1980. This was when my pair of Scarlet Cock-
of-the-Rocks Rupicola peruviana hatched two chicks that lived for only a
few days. Perhaps the more varied livefood available these days would
have assisted in a successful outcome. The male died soon after mating,
while the female, which came from Len Hill at Birdland, Bourton-on-the-
Water, lived here for several more years. I should perhaps state here that
my male cock-of-the-rock that lived here for 16 years was not the male
involved in the unsuccessful breeding attempt.

BREEDING THE THREE-BANDED ROSEFINCH
Carpodacus trifasciatus
by Eric Callaghan
Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984965194444445" page_id="56293928"  page_num="67" year="" vol="">
The Three-banded (or Three-barred) Rosefinch is a medium-sized
rosefinch that is native to western and southern China. The habitat is
given as conifer forest, undergrowth and thickets at between 2,130m and
3,050m (approx. 7,000ft and 10,000ft). In the late autumn and early winter
it descends to 1,800m (approx. 5,900ft), to foothills and valleys, and in the
winter is found in orchards, hedges and barley fields. Its breeding biology
is described as &amp;apos;virtually unknown 5 (Clements, P., Harris, P. and Davies, J.,
1993).
The adult male has a dark red head with white shaft streaks on the
lores, cheeks and ear-coverts. The upperparts are grey, with a strong reddish
tinge. The breast and flanks are wine-red, with the sides of the breast grey,
while the centre of the lower breast, the belly and the lower flanks are
white. The outer scapulars are white, forming a diagonal band above the
closed wing, while the feathers of the median and greater wing-coverts are
tipped with pink, thus producing the three-banded effect that has given the
bird its common (and scientific) name. The female and juvenile have grey
upperparts, streaked with black, yellowish-buff edges to the tertial feathers,
warm orange-brown on the throat, breast and flanks, with the rest of the
underparts white. This rosefinch measures 17cm-19.5cm (6%in-7%in) in
length and conveys the impression of a solidly-built, sturdy species.
Housing
Two pairs of Three-banded Rosefinches were obtained in January 1994.
During the following spring one of the females died, leaving a spare male.
The pair was housed in an aviary measuring 4m x 1.5m x 2m high (approx.
13ft x 5ft x 6ft lOin high). The aviary was divided into two adjoining
enclosures, each approx. 2m (6ft 7in) long but the dividing door was left
permanently open. The back and one side of the aviary are solid and part
of the roof is covered with perspex. The aviary is unplanted, save for a
1.5m (approx. 5ft) Mahonia aquilegifolia, as the birds destroyed any other
attempts at planting. Bundles of heather are tied around the back and sides
to provide cover. Short lengths of conifer branches were placed at the front
corners, just below the roof, as experience with Pallas' Rosefinch C. roseus
has shown that these would be preferred nesting sites. Indeed these were
the sites chosen for nesting.
From the beginning the pair shared the aviary with a pair of Yellow-
throated Buntings Emberiza elegans and a pair of Rufous-bellied Niltavas

Niltava sundara, neither of which attempted to nest. No aggression towards
these species was recorded. Occasionally the male niltava would briefly
chase one of the other birds, but nothing serious ever occurred. Perhaps it
might have been different if the niltavas had gone to nest.

Feeding

<bodyText confidence="0.999576090909091" page_id="56293929"  page_num="68" year="" vol="">
This consisted of a canary seed mixture, mixed millets (rarely touched)
and 'Puik' wildbird seed mixture. In addition, there was softfood for the
niltavas which consisted of a mixture of Witte Molen Universal softfood
and a homemade food, based on CeDe eggfood and ground peanuts.
Mealworms were offered regularly, but the rosefinches were never seen to
touch them. Greenfood, in the form of chickweed, was always popular. As
with most species with red in the plumage, a colouring agent was required
during the moult to maintain the colour of the feathers. This was supplied
in the drinking water. One effect of this has been to produce a deep reddish
tinge to the plumage of the female and the immatures that is apparently not
present in wild birds. Bathing facilities are always available.

The first year (1994) passed uneventfully, as the birds were settling
down, although it was noticeable from the very beginning that the birds
were steady and not shy. In March 1995 both males became ill from an
unknown cause (the extra male was housed in a separate aviary), but both
recovered after a few days. Throughout the summer both males sang and
carried nesting material in the form of lengths of fibre and down. Whenever
the female attempted to pick up material she was attacked and chased by
the male, and was forced to drop it. The attack consisted of the male
advancing rapidly along the perch, with the head lowered, the beak open
and the mantle feathers raised. This was accompanied by a loud 'tsick,
tsick' call. What sounded to be the same call was occasionally uttered
from a perch in early May, apparently as an advertising call, and whenever
I entered the aviary after nesting had begun. The song of the male is a
continuous, high-pitched, squeaky, twittering sound that is delivered so
faintly that it cannot be heard from any distance away. It seems to be
uttered as the male moves around the aviary, rather than delivered from a
fixed song post.

In the spring both males again became very ill and the unpaired one
died. The second male made a complete recovery. At no time was the
female affected. Again the female was attacked by the male whenever she
attempted to pick up nesting material, but this time she was more persistent
and by 18th May both were seen carrying bundles of coconut fibre. On

of the branches that had been fixed at the front of the aviary. These twigs
were about 15cm (6in) long. After three days no progress had been made
as the twigs fell from the site each time the female left, and as she never
retrieved any of them a small pile formed on the ground below. At this
point I fitted a wicker basket at the intended nest site, with the result that
the female promptly abandoned the site and started to attempt to build at
the other site at the front of the aviary, with exactly the same result, as
again the twigs failed to lodge there. Finally, on the 2nd June, the female
returned to the first site and started to line the basket with coconut fibre.
By the 5th June she was adding an inner lining of goat hair, plus a few
feathers. The first egg was laid on the 8th June and was bright blue with
just a few black spots at the blunt end. It was a typical rosefinch egg. A
total of three eggs was laid and the male was occasionally seen feeding the
female on the nest. At no time was the male seen to feed the female away
from the nest, nor was any courtship behaviour witnessed, or copulation.
Two eggs hatched on the 22nd June, the third hatched the following
morning. The newly-hatched chicks were dark-skinned, with dark grey
down. The gape was red. In an attempt to rear at least some of the young,
one chick was transferred to a canary that was incubating an infertile clutch
of eggs. All three chicks were very well fed, at times having crops so full
that they looked about to burst. The male rosefinch took an equal part in
the feeding of the young. For the first week the birds fed almost exclusively
on seeding chickweed. Soaked seed and eggfood were offered but were not
touched until the chicks were over a week old. Livefood was totally ignored.
The young grew very well and by the 28th June the female had ceased
brooding them for much of the day. It was very noticeable how solid and
bulky the nestlings felt whenever they were handled, an intrusion which
apart from producing the vocalisations already referred to, never seemed to
bother the parents unduly.
Unfortunately I was away from the 1st to 14th July, but I understand
that the first chick fledged on the 7th July. On my return on the 14th both
chicks were looking very strong (the chick fostered with the canary had
failed to survive) and their tails were about one-third full length. In addition,
I was surprised to discover that the female was sitting on a new nest at the
second site, where I had placed a second wicker basket. This nest contained
four eggs. This is in contrast to the Pallas' Rosefinch, which I had bred
previously, where a second nest was never attempted, even in cases where
the first nest had failed. During the incubation period of the second clutch,
the young of the first brood developed the habit of sitting beside the female,
even though the male had taken over all their feeding. The young were
seen to pull at the nest and remove some of the material, so both they and
the male were moved into the second half of the aviary and the connecting
door was closed. The other species were also confined to this half, leaving

the incubating female totally alone. This did not appear to bother the
female and the following day (22nd July) one egg hatched, indicating that
the first egg must have been laid just after the first brood fledged. At this
stage there were only two further eggs in the nest. Neither of these hatched,
although both were fertile. One was slightly damaged and half of the shell
of the egg which had hatched had capped the other egg. The female reared
the single chick without any problems and it fledged on the 9th August,
therefore taking longer than the previous brood, that had been fed by both
parents. On the 16th August the interconnecting door was re-opened and
all the birds were allowed to mix. On fledging the young were a dull grey
in colour, with pronounced streaking on the breast.
Colour-feeding was resumed at the end of August and while both young
of the first brood developed red in their plumage, the chick from the second
brood failed to do so, indicating that it was not consuming any of the treated
water. This youngster developed a greenish-yellow colour where the others
were red. Of the first two young, while both superficially resembled the
adult female, on closer examination one was seen to be slightly brighter
than the other, with slightly more extensive colour. The uncoloured
immature seemed to follow the second chick from the first brood with regard
to its plumage pattern. This suggests that perhaps I had one male and two
females. Later the 'female-coloured' immature from the first brood died
and on dissection proved indeed to be a female. The remaining young
were left with the adults throughout the winter until the beginning of March
1997, when the adult male began to chase them a little.
In terms of general management these rosefinches have presented no
problems, save for the mystery illness of the males. Unfortunately, it was
not possible to arrange to have a post-mortem examination carried out on
the one that died. The birds showed no aggression towards other species
and the rearing of the young was quite straightforward, without the
inconvenience of having to supply livefood.

SEASONAL WEIGHT VARIATION IN FOUR SPECIES OF
CAPTIVE CRANES AT THE INTERNATIONAL CRANE
FOUNDATION
by Carmen Davis
Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988291652173913" page_id="56293932"  page_num="71" year="" vol="">
The body weights of four species of cranes kept at the International
Crane Foundation (ICF) were used to establish a normal baseline of seasonal
weight variation in captive cranes. The non-migratory Florida Sandhill
Crane Grus canadensis pratensis , and three migratory cranes: Siberian
G. leucogemnus. Whooping G. americana, and Red-crowned G. japonensis
were studied. Weights were assigned to one of three seasons and mean
weights for each season were calculated for both sexes of each species.
Percentage weight gain between summer and winter was calculated for
those individuals that had weights in all three seasons. Statistical analysis
revealed significant weight gain from summer to winter for all groups except
female Florida Sandhill Cranes. There was no apparent relationship between
the magnitude of seasonal weight gain in captive birds and the migration
pattern of their wild counterparts.
Introduction
In captive management of cranes, body weight can be a useful indicator
of health; below-normal weight may indicate illness. Since cranes often
experience large seasonal weight variation, normal published seasonal
weight values are needed (Swengel, 1992). Weights were collected for
Siberian, Florida Sandhill, Whooping, and Red-crowned Cranes kept at
ICF. The weights of 134 individuals were used to establish a normal weight
baseline for captive cranes. Weights were also analyzed to test hypotheses
about variation in seasonal weight gain between migratory and non-
migratory species.

The four species chosen for analysis include three migratory species
and one non-migratory species, the Florida Sandhill Crane. It was
hypothesized that migratory species would experience greater seasonal
weight variation. An earlier study documented significant weight gain
during spring migration in wild Arctic-nesting Sandhill Cranes (Krapu et
ah, 1985). I also tested the hypothesis that among migratory species those
that migrate the farthest distance would experience the greatest weight
gain. Weights were obtained from ICF health records between 1980 and
1997. Weights were collected from 134 individuals: 45 Whooping, 37
Siberian, 29 Florida Sandhill and 23 Red-crowned Cranes. The weights of
birds less than one year old were excluded from the study because these

individuals may not have been full-grown. Weights taken when a bird was
known to be seriously ill were also excluded. If an individual was weighed
more than once in a given month, the mean weight for that month was
used. This resulted in a total of 442 weights.
Weights were assigned to one of three seasons: 1 =summer (April-
August), 2=fall (September-October) or 3=winter (November-March). It
was hypothesized that body weight would be greatest in winter and least in
summer. Initially, it seemed that assigning four seasons would have greater
statistical power in describing seasonal weight variation. However, the
sample size for spring (March-April) weights is much smaller than for the
other seasons and spring weights did not seem to differ much from summer
weights. Therefore, linear regression analysis of weight versus season using
both the three and four-season models was conducted. The three-season
model yielded a better description of seasonal weight variation. Mean
weights for both sexes of each species in each season were computed using
all of the weights collected.
Forty-four individuals had weights for all three seasons: 13 Siberian,
nine Florida Sandhill. 13 Whooping, and nine Red-crowned Cranes. A
mean weight for each of these individuals in each season was determined.
The mean percent weight gain between summer and winter was calculated.
Paired t-tests of summer and winter weights and linear regression analysis
of weight versus season were conducted for both sexes of each species. For
regressions, summer was coded as 1, fall as 2 and winter as 3. Statistical
analysis and graphs were done using Systat 5.03.

Mean seasonal weights of males and females of each species are
presented in Table 1. Seasonal weight variation of all males and females of
all four species, regardless of whether they had weights in multiple seasons,
is illustrated in Figures 1-4. The results of paired t- tests of summer and
winter weights are displayed in Table 2. Results of linear regression analysis
of mean weight versus season for birds weighed in all three seasons are
presented in Table 3. Positive R-values indicate that the birds gained weight
from summer to fall to winter. Table 4 shows the mean percent weight
gain between summer and winter for individuals weighed in all three
seasons.

and winter based on paired t-tests (Table 2). Weights were higher in winter
for all of the t-tests. Linear regression analysis also yielded significant

Sandhill Cranes were the only group to not have significant weight variation
with season using either test.
Variation in seasonal weight gain between species did not match the
expected pattern. Seasonal weight gain in females came close to fitting the
expected pattern; Florida Sandhill Cranes experienced the least weight gain
between summer and winter and Siberian Cranes experienced the greatest
(Table 4). In contrast, male Siberian Cranes experienced the least weight
gain even though they are the farthest migrating species of the four studied.
Male Red-crowned Cranes underwent the greatest seasonal weight gain
despite having the shortest migration distance of the three migratory species
studied. Unfortunately, sample sizes are small because few birds were
weighed in both summer and winter. More data should be collected in
order to analyze statistically the variation in seasonal weight gain between
species. The role that captive conditions play in seasonal weight variation
should also be considered.
The cranes at ICF have access to a nutritionally-balanced food supply
throughout the year. Food is readily available whenever the cranes want to
eat. In addition, they have a limited opportunity to exercise relative to wild
cranes and they never migrate. Since ICF is located at 43.5*N latitude it is
possible that fall weight gain is largely due to the onset of harsh winter
temperatures and subsequent increased food intake. Likewise, spring weight
loss could be explained by decreased food intake as warm temperatures
return and breeding begins. A study of food intake in captive White-naped
Cranes G. vipio suggests just such a pattern (Jing, 1991).
Swengel (1992) points out that cranes may exhibit different degrees of
weight variation depending upon the latitude and captive conditions of
their facility. Individuals using the mean seasonal weight values provided
in Table 1 should keep these factors in mind. Obviously, there is also
variation in seasonal weight patterns between different individuals,
regardless of the species. Therefore, it is ideal to establish normal weight
criteria for each individual crane.

1995 was a good year here at The Tropical Bird Gardens, Rode, with
58 species being bred, excluding domesticated varieties. Improvements
and alterations to aviaries were ongoing and the summer was very hot with
long dry spells. No large macaws were reared due to thefts in 1994 and at
the end of 1995, when there were two break-ins, the second on the night of
Thursday 30th November, resulting in the loss of our pair of Hyacinth
Macaws Anodorhynclus hyacinthinus . Despite some leads and a search
entailing driving over 2,000 miles (approx.3,200km), they still have not
been recovered. A substantial reward for information leading to their return
and a subsequent conviction remains on offer.
Waterfowl had a reasonable year of which the highlight was the breeding
of two Australian Shelduck Tadoma tadornoides. It was the first time that
this species - Donald Risdon's favourite shelduck - has bred at Rode. The
female laid her clutch of nine eggs in the centre of a large clump of pampas
grass. Three young hatched of which two were reared and later were sent
to Paignton Zoo. Red-breasted Geese Branta ruficollis were reared under
a bantam, and we also reared our first ever Hawaiian Goose#, sandvicensis.
Eight Temminck's Tragopans Tragopan temminckii were also reared under
bantams and were another first breeding for us. A single Satyr Tragopan
T. satyra was reared by a bantam.
A new male Sonnerat's Jungle Fowl Gallus sonneratii lent to us by
Dave Coles at the Childe Beale Trust, led to an improved performance by
our Sonnerat's Jungle Fowl, with ten being raised under bantams. Two
Green Peafowl Pavo muticus were another first breeding for Rode. The
male came from Paignton Zoo ten years ago, while the female was obtained
from a friend in Chippenham, who found it walking up his drive. When he
rang to offer the bird to us, I thought he was joking and expected the Indian
species P. cristatus. He brought it over within the hour and it was readily
accepted by our peacock. A single Grey Peacock Pheasant Polyplectron
bicalcaratum meant this lovely bird was bred at Rode for the 30th
consecutive year.
Rode is well known for its parrot collection and in 1995 our Red-tailed
Amazons Amazona basiliensis bred for the second time. Two young were
reared. We bred our first youngster in 1994, for which we received the
Avicultural Society's first breeding award. When the article was published,
I suggested that it was probably the first European breeding and perhaps a
world first. The article was also published elsewhere and brought a letter
from J. M. Forgach, a Brazilian, who said that several have been bred
there.

There was in 1995 a definite policy change with the decision to parent-
rear young and hand-rear only in emergencies. This resulted in only three
Double Yellow-headed Amazons A. ochrocephala oratrix being hand-reared
from two weeks old, when the female looked very tired. She laid again and
from three eggs produced two young. This is our old breeding pair. Three
Hahn's Macaws Ara nobilis were a noteworthy breeding, as was a single
Eleonora Cockatoo Cacatua galerita eleonora, which was another first
breeding for Rode.
Pink-crested and Livingstone's Touracos Tauraco erythrolophus and
T. corythaix livingstonii were both first breedings for us, and a single White-
cheeked Touraco T. leucotis made it a good year for us with this family of
birds. Purple Glossy Starlings Lamprotornis purpureus from the old
breeding group established in 1964 reared two young. Two Greater Hill
Mynahs Gracula religiosa were parent-reared, as were four Laughing
Kookaburras Dacelo novaeguineae. Toucan Barbets Semnornis
ramphastinus and Yellow-fronted Tinkerbirds Pogoniulus chrysoconus each
produced a single youngster, breeding accounts of which appeared in the
Avicultural Magazine , 102, 1: 6-7 and 36-38 respectively.
Among the doves a single Celebes Quail Dove Gallicolumba tristigmata
stood out as another first breeding for us. It was reared in one of the
aviaries in Yew Tree Walk. The pair built a nest 45cm (17%in) above the
floor in the shelter. Paul Sherbourne, the keeper responsible, made a nest
for them after the previous single eggs had been broken due to their poorly
constructed nests. Their food consisted of mixed seeds and Orlux softbill
food. They did not take any livefood and ignored the fruit and meat provided
for the Grey Hornbills Tockus nasutus with which they share the aviary.
Two Sarus Cranes Grus antigone were reared. We have a pair from
Chester Zoo and our own pair consisting of a captive-bred female which is
at least 20 years old and a wild-caught male. Each contributed to our
success, though all our cranes are fostered now. I believe that we have a
good rate of fertility with our Chilean Flamingos Phoenicopterus chilensis,
with five young being raised from eight eggs. These birds are much admired
by the public and I am pleased that we are now breeding them on a regular
basis. Lastly, I would mention that two Stone Curlews Burhinus oedicnemus
were hand-reared.

The pelican colony at Longleat Safari Park, Wilts,, has been kept
successfully for a number of years, but it was not until 1993 that a bird
began to show signs of attempting to nest. These early attempts were simply
arrangements of twigs on a tree stump in the pond. During July 1994 two
platforms were constructed and erected at the edge of the pond, creating a
raised connection between the bank and a small island, in the hope that the
birds would become familiar with them and start using them as nest sites
the following season.
Females indicate their readiness to breed by becoming increasingly red
on the legs and inside the gular pouch. This normally reaches its reddest
about two to three weeks before mating occurs. In nuptial plumage the
females also have a longer crest (on the nape), which the males lack. The
males' role initially is to collect nesting material and build the bulk of the
nest, Longleat staff help at this stage by collecting bins full of small twigs
and unload them at the side of the pond. The male pelicans collect beaksful
of these twigs and take them to the nest. Any twigs which fall into the
pond are not retrieved and as a result the males may gather twice as much
nesting material as they need. The males perform their head bobbing and
bill clapping display at the nest, before mating with the females, also on
the nest platforms. Pairs which re-nest usually do so on the same nest
platforms as they laid their previous clutches.
By September 1994 the birds were investigating their new nest sites
and by late November the first clutch of eggs had been laid but all were
infertile. At the beginning of December a second female laid an egg, which
was abandoned by the female and was subsequently taken away to be
artificially incubated. This egg was fertile and hatched, but unfortunately
the chick did not prosper, and died after only seven days.
The diet given to the adult pelicans consisted of a twice daily ration of
sprats and mackerel scattered across the pond to allow the birds to forage
for their food. There is a slow but constant flow of water through the pond
so any food which is missed does not accumulate and sour the water. At
about six-monthly intervals freshly-netted freshwater fish were released
into the pond for the pelicans to feed on in a natural fashion. Although
this diet was adequate enough to get the birds to come into breeding
condition and to lay eggs, It was later re-evaluated with the aim of increasing
the viability of the eggs. To this end, beginning in March 1996, a quarter
of a Mazurl fish-eater tablet was placed in the fish. About half of the daily
ration was painstakingly prepared in this way.

At the same time it was decided that in the future any eggs laid would
be left with the pairs to incubate. However, of the eggs which were laid
and incubated by the pairs none were hatched successfully. Although the
eggs were known to be fertile, many were cast off the platforms usually by
females of other pairs which had already lost their own eggs. Some eggs
were developing, one even reached the point of pipping before the chick
died inside. Losses were attributed to difficulties during the growth of the
embryos, thought to be due to problems with the humidity in the nests.
One or two pairs of eggs were taken from the nests and artificially
incubated during 1994 and 1995, but unsuccessfully, these failures again
being attributed to incorrect humidity. It was due to this that in June 1996
a pair of freshly laid eggs, the twenty-third and twenty-fourth to be laid,
were transferred to Birdworld near Farnham, Surrey, for incubation.
Although both eggs were fertile, only one of them succeeded in hatching,
after a 33 day incubation period. Of three eggs measured and weighed, the
average dimensions and weight were:-
Length Width Weight
77.3mm 50.8mm 113.2g
All of the eggs have ranged in weight from 100g-155g. The egg which
hatched successfully weighed 124.3g, when laid, and with controlled
humidity in the incubator, a steady 11%-15% loss of weight was achieved
by day 31. The egg was incubated at a steady 37.5*C (99.5*F) and was
turned automatically 96 times a day until the chick had pipped into the air
cell of the egg. At this point the egg was removed from the incubator and
set in the hatcher, where it was kept at 36.5*C (97.7*F) and was left unturned.
On day 32 the first external hole appeared in the shell and within 24 hours
the chick had hatched. It was a good, pink colour, and was naked and had
its eyes open. It appeared strong and healthy, but probably perfectly
naturally, was unable to support its relatively massive head. The chick
remained in the hatcher for a further 12 hours and was then moved into a
brooder heated to 36*C (96.8*F). The brooder was set with a high humidify,
as in the past we had experienced dehydration and dry, peeling skin, with
naked chicks.
On hatching the chick weighed 95g. The first feed was attempted on
the evening of the first day using liquidised sprat, primarily because this
was already prepared for penguin chicks which were being raised at the
same time. The chick's head was supported with one hand, while a spoon
was used to dibble the food into its throat pouch. Unfortunately, the chick
seemed to have difficulty swallowing it and most of it was voided, leaving
the chick in danger of suffocating as a result of the liquid food blocking its
airways. After gently wiping the inside of the beak clean, it was decided to
leave well alone until the following day.

On the second day the chick was fed at two-hourly intervals between
8.00am and 8.00pm. After a rethink about the diet, we tried feeding it
small, boned carp, about 3cm (approx. 114in) in length. To prepare the
meals the fish were first placed in hot water for a few minutes, which made
the flesh soft and easy to extract by cutting off the tail and scraping out the
body meat with a knife, leaving behind the skin and the bones. With the
addition of a little hot water, the resulting moist mash could be fed to the
chick, again using a spoon. This worked far better than the first attempt,
and the chick expelled some of the excess water from its mouth by squeezing
the gular pouch against its neck (in a similar fashion to adult pelicans
when they have dredged a beakful offish and water) before swallowing the
food.
The chick's weight increased well over the first week, attaining gains
of between 10% and 20% each day. The diet was varied to include chopped
pinkie mice and sprats, which were coarsely mashed and mixed with the
carp. By day 6 the feeding regime was changed to three-hourly feeds between
8.00am and 8.00pm, and the heating was also changed. The chick was
taken out of the brooder and placed under a heat lamp, so that it had fresher
air to breath. Because of the nature of its diet, the aroma in the confines of
the brooder was thought not to be hygienic enough.
The young pelican was attempting to feed itself by day 8 and was
encouraged to do so. A bowl containing a variety of chopped fish and
chopped day-old chicks, dusted with Avimix for calcium and vitamins,
was held towards the chick and at the beginning of each feed it confidently
(and to its own vocal accomplishment) collected pouchfuls of food without
needing too much assistance. Towards the end of the feed however, the
food needed to be offered with tweezers, otherwise, over the coarse of the
day, not enough food would be taken to produce a good weight gain. This
feeding method was employed for a further few days until the chick was
capable of taking all its daily food independently. If it was aided by hand
and Overfed, any excess food would quickly be voided.
By days 7-10, although it was still bald, white spots were beginning to
appear under the skin which slowly over the next week to ten days produced
very thick down over the body. Once the growth of down was complete,
the chick would easily overheat and so needed regular monitoring. At 14
days old it weighed 800g and was eating about 600g of mixed fish, which
were given over the coarse of four feeds between 8.00am and 5.00pm. Within
another week it weighed l,950g, although it was being fed only about 50g
more of food per day. The diet was reduced mainly to sprats and occasionally
pieces of day-old chicks. The fish were fed whole, but only after they had
been scalded to make them soft.
By day 23 the young pelican was starting to regurgitate and simply

refuse food and consumed only 470g of food on that day, producing a weight
gain of 3.2% on day 24, when only 550g of food were eaten. At this point
we did not want to make it eat any more than it wanted to, believing that it
would regain its appetite when it was ready. Day 25 produced a weight
loss of 1.7%, but the appetite had certainly returned and 820g of food were
consumed that day and the weight gain was nearly 10%.
On day 27 the chick was returned to Longleat for them to continue the
hand-rearing. At this stage it weighed 3,000g and was attempting to walk
(for two or three days it had already been able to stand for short periods),
but this was very new to it, and was not at first a great success. The flight
feathers were just beginning to show, while the only other feathers coming
through were the scapulars, but these were still only quills. The transfer
was successful and all the information on feeding, weights and notable
behaviour was passed on to Mark Tye who undertook the completion of the
rearing at Longleat. The feeding continued as it had Birdworld, though
with the inclusion after a few days of mackerel. The feeds averaged only
550g of food per day and the weight gains were between 2% and 7%,
which were constant until it was 44 days old when the weight had reached
5,100g. Attaining this weight had been fairly slow and many feeds had
been refused, sometimes the chick would eat only a single fish at a time,
and often feeds would end with the bird going into spasms. This was
obviously a worrying time, but with a little research it was found that
throwing fits after feeding is really quite 'normal' in wild-reared chicks,
even if there is no obvious reason for it.
The weight of 5,100g was maintained for 11 days. The chick was now
becoming increasingly well feathered and exercising more, though it spent
much of its time resting or sleeping. Water was encountered for the first
time at 50 days old, and the experience was not a popular one, in fact it was
becoming obvious that any changes in the daily routine were unpopular,
but needed to be persevered with in an effort to allow the chick to acquire
its pelican personality.
The weight was on the move again by day 54, this time down, the
decrease was one of 300g which took five days to achieve, but as food was
only being left out for independent feeding and no extra feeds were given,
the situation was just monitored, as the bird seemed content and showed no
signs of illness. Exercise was encouraged and the young pelican was given
increasingly more space to practise wing-flapping. It walked well for long
periods and by 60 or so days was becoming more used to water, it was even
observed bathing, although water was quite obviously not a favourite
medium. Rain was encountered on a few afternoons, again it did not revel
in this, but it was useful in that after it became wet it usually preened and
as a result the feathers were becoming noticeably more waterproof.

On day 77 the now almost fully feathered pelican was moved to the
adult colony on the exhibition pond. For a few weeks each night it continued
to be locked in a house within the enclosure and soon learnt to put itself
away at night, when the days began to get shorter. Once it was used to the
enclosure, it was time for it to start exploring, though it did not take to the
water. Instead it was keen to explore the nest platforms and would spend
entire days on them. Fortunately, the adult pelicans did not seem too
concerned by this.
The most significant points occurred after 100 days, when it was seen
swimming without first having to be put into the water and on the following
days it also swam and spent time with the adults, without any aggression
being shown towards it. It was even seen trying to fish for itself in the
presence of the other birds.
With hindsight it would appear that the slow growth rate could be quite
normal and the regurgitation and refusal of food was due to accidental
overfeeding. It is very difficult to rear species for the first time without
being over protective, especially when there are no guidelines to follow.
Hopefully, however, the task will now become more fluent and practised.
The 'Pelicans of Longleat' continue to lay eggs regularly and in the future
there could well be some parent-reared chicks, which I greatly look forward
to seeing.
Paul Wexler used to work at Birdworld near Farnham, Surrey, but now
works at Chessington World of Adventures, Chessington, Surrey KT9 2NE,
England. He believes this may be the first pelican to be raised in the UK.

The Vinaeeous Amazon Amazona vinacea formerly occurred across
quite an extensive range in the Atlantic forest regions of southern and
eastern South America. Its range in Brazil originally stretched from Bahia
to Rio Grande do Sul and on into eastern Paraguay and also Argentina.
Today the number of Vinaeeous Amazons has declined across nearly all of
this range, with its last strongholds being in southern Brazil and eastern
Paraguay, although small populations can still be found scattered across
other parts of its former range. The decline of this species has been partially
documented in recent years, but its current status over most of its range is
unclear and this should be of great concern. Further field work is needed
on the ecology of this species. There is also the need to protect the habitat
in the most important regions where the remaining populations live, if the
decline of this species is to be slowed down and the wild population is to
have a viable future.

With an adult body length of about 30cm (ll%in), the Vinaceous
Amazon is a medium-sized member of the Amazona genus with strikingly
marked plumage. The basic coloration is green with black tips to the
feathers. A red frontal band across the front of the face which connects to
the lores (the forehead, lores and chin are red), is one of the main
distinguishing features of this species, as is its deep red bill. The most
interesting physiological feature is the long erectile feathers on the hindneck
which can be fanned to a much greater extent than those of any other
Amazona species, with the resulting display being very similar to that of
the Hawk-headed Parrot Deroptyus accipitrinus. The feathers of the upper
breast and abdomen are purplish-red (vinous) in colour and provide this
species with its common name. This area of vinous coloration is however
much reduced in young birds, which fledge with a duller greenish-brown
underbody coloration which they retain during their first year. Several
adults were weighed at the end of the 1996 breeding season at Loro Parque
and showed an average weight of 395g for males and 365g for females,
from a sample of four adults of each gender.
Two decades ago, before its placement on Appendix 1 of the CITES
Convention, this species was available in aviculture. It was never imported
into Europe in very large numbers but nevertheless it was frequently offered
for sale. Its price was higher than that for other Amazona species available
at the time, due to its striking appearance and talent as a mimic. As the
trade in wild birds was brought to an end, the captive population declined
noticeably. While this species has shown itself willing to breed for those
who provide suitable husbandry and have enough individuals to allow
natural mate selection to take place, captive breeding has been very
disappointing, considering the quantity of birds which were formerly
available.
In current day aviculture, there appears to continue to be a significant
number of birds kept in Europe. A survey of Amazon parrots in European
zoos which was conducted in 1993 and published in 1994 by EAZA, listed
59 Vinaceous Amazons being kept in 11 zoological collections: of these,
only three collections, Loro Parque (Spain), Vogelpark Walsrode (Germany)
and Beauval (France) had recorded breeding successes. It is known however
that a significant number of Vinaceous Amazons are kept by private
aviculturists in Europe and if these holders are willing to work in cooperation
with an EEP scheme that may be initiated for this species, then the known
captive population in Europe might be large enough to be considered as
viable.
The husbandry of the Vinaceous Amazon in captivity is similar to that
for other species of the Amazona genus. At Loro Parque we maintain one
pair in a display aviary In the exhibition area of the park, and several more

pairs are maintained in suspended breeding cages in our off-exhibit breeding
areas. The suspended breeding cages measure approximately 300cm long
x 95cm in both width and height (9ft lOin x 3ft Wi in x 3ft lVzin) and are
positioned with the length of the cages extending away from the keeper,
and with all servicing taking place at the front. Each cage has the nest-box
positioned against the outside back panel, and there is a hole cut in the
wire to allow the birds to enter the nest-box. With the nest-box situated on
the outside of the cage, this eliminates the need to enter it to service or
inspect the nest-box.
The feeding of these birds is undertaken twice a day. At 7.00am they
receive their main food dish which contains a mixed salad prepared with
the following items:- apple, pear, tomato, beetroot, carrots, alfalfa, lettuce,
peppers, papaya and other seasonally available fruits and vegetables; in
addition we also use, when available, several fruits which are grown in the
park, such as the prickly-pear from cactus plants and the berry from the
Queen Palm Tree. A second smaller food dish in the morning provides the
birds with commercial dietary pellets, and during the breeding season we
also give each pair segments of our own supplement 'cake' which is made
fresh daily. The afternoon feed is given at 3.00pm, when a mixture of nuts,
seeds and cooked beans replaces the salad dish from the morning.
The Vinaceous Amazon was first bred at Loro Parque in 1990, when a
single chick was hand-reared. The pair proved to be very unreliable when
it came to incubating their eggs and so have always had their eggs removed
for artificial or foster incubation and rearing. This pair of Vinaceous
Amazons have on subsequent occasions been given eggs of more common
species to give them the opportunity of proving themselves to be good
parents, but to date they continue to be unreliable.
No breeding took place in 1991 but the pair did lay again in 1992,
when further hand-rearing was carried out and another chick was reared.
In 1993 when the same pair laid again, the clutch of eggs was transferred
to a pair of Green-cheeked Amazons A. viridigenalis which have proved to
be excellent foster parents and raised both chicks that hatched. The same
technique was employed in 1994, but only one egg from the clutch proved
to be fertile and the chick from this was successfully reared by the Green-
cheeked Amazons.
In 1995 the Vinaceous Amazons' first clutch was infertile but they
produced a second clutch of which one egg was fertile. However, by the
time the second clutch was laid they were out of sequence with the pair of
Green-cheeked Amazons used as foster parents which had laid earlier and
which were by now busy fostering a clutch of Red-browed Amazons A.

After being weaned the chick was socialised with a group of other
Amazons (including the 1994 Vinaceous Amazon chick) and it soon settled
into normal patterns of behaviour with no sign of being imprinted. In
1996, the same situation was repeated - by the time the Vinaceous Amazons
laid, the foster parents were again busy rearing a clutch of Red-browed
Amazon chicks. A single egg was fertile and hatched but unfortunately
the chick had severe spinal deformities and was euthanased when it became
apparent that the deformities could not be corrected to a degree whereby
the chick could live a normal life. On the occasions in 1995 and 1996
when eggs were taken for machine incubation, I measured the external
dimensions of several eggs from the same female of which the average
dimensions were 45.4mm x 30.3mm.
Up until 1996, all of the chicks had come from one adult pair, but in
late 1995 we changed some of our pairing arrangements and this led to the
pair of birds in the exhibition aviary breeding for the first time. A clutch of
eggs was recorded in the first week of March and by the 31st March two
chicks had hatched. This first clutch eventually resulted in four healthy,
chicks which initially grew and developed well. However, when the chicks
were fitted with closed leg bands, we noticed that the older chick emitted a
bad odour from its mouth, from which a swab was taken which revealed a

fungal infection. All four chicks were removed from the nest and were
treated in the nursery, where they were hand fed until they were weaned.
A second clutch from the exhibition birds was laid on the 25th May and
resulted in two chicks the first of which hatched on the 22nd June. As with
the first clutch, the chicks were removed from the nest-box after three weeks
as a precaution, given the problems previously encountered. On examining
the two chicks in the nursery, it appeared that our caution was justified, as
one of the chicks showed early signs of a fungal infection. This was treated
quickly and no further complications were noted. The source of the fungal
infection remains unidentified; both parents have undergone a thorough
examination and neither of them appear to be the source of the infection.
The nest-box has been replaced and, as is now a precaution with all of our
birds which parent-rear their young, the wood shavings inside the nest-
boxes are treated with an anti-fungal agent each time the nesting medium
is replaced. The rearing of six young from a new pair in 1996 means that
once these birds mature we will be able to make up unrelated pairs of first
generation Vinaceous Amazons. The hope is that in a few years we will be
able to achieve the second generation breeding of this species at Loro Parque.
The Vinaceous Amazon is clearly endangered in the wild and although
in aviculture some successful breeding is being achieved, it is unclear how
secure the captive population is at the present time. Information from the
EAZA survey of European zoos indicates that there should be enough birds
in captivity to form a self-sustaining population, but this at present remains
only speculation. The Vinaceous Amazon is one of the species which has
been included in the EEP Amazon collection planning for European zoos,
which identifies this species as one upon which zoos should concentrate
their breeding efforts. It has also been urged that this species become the
subject of a full EEP (European Endangered Species) programme, but this
has so far not materialised. In order to gain a more accurate assessment of
the captive status of this and other endangered Amazon species, a survey is
presently being carried out by Gustavo Sanchez, a post-graduate biologist
working in cooperation with the Loro Parque Foundation. This student is
surveying the known European populations of these species so that a detailed
demographic and genetic evaluation can be presented to the Psittacine Taxon
Advisory Group to accurately identify the immediate priorities. Although
this work remains ongoing, it is certain that the Vinaceous Amazon will be
one of the highest priorities.

The Minds of Birds
How much do we know of what is going on in the minds of birds? I
have long been fascinated by this question. Although we can often guess at
why a bird has behaved in a particular way, when the behaviour is not
instinctive, just what is going through the bird's mind? Undoubtedly many
birds can work things out in a subjective way, just as we do - but they do not
have a vocabulary of words to help them. When I saw The Minds of Birds
advertised I sent away for it at once. The author is Alexander Skutch, one
of the world's greatest ornithological writers. He has been observing birds
for 60 years. If anyone knows what is going on in a bird's mind, it must be
him, I thought.
The book is fascinating, yes, but it throws little light on the minds of
birds. It would have been more aptly titled The Behaviour of Birds. As the
author admits: 'I regarded their feelings and thoughts as the most important,
but unfortunately the most baffling, aspect of their lives. After watching
and reading about birds for so many years, I am far less certain of what
goes on inside their heads than of what they visibly do...' His chapters
describe such aspects as recognition of individuals, memory and anticipation,
social life, counting and timing, and the brain and senses. He draws on his
own extensive experiences, mainly with Neotropical perching birds, and
quotes anecdotes of many other observers.
In the chapter entitled The Mind of a Parrot , he describes the much-
quoted work of Irene Pepperberg with the now famous Grey Parrot, Alex.
There is little mention of parrots elsewhere. His chapter on Emotions
might have been filled with anecdotes from bird keepers, many of whom
have interesting tales to tell about emotional responses of their pets in
certain situations. On the whole his comments on this chapter are confined
to wild birds and, for example, their emotional attachment to their nests
and young. However, in quoting Cynthia Bluhm's experiments with
Canvasback Ducks, he makes a point which aviculturists would do well to
remember. So often we expect birds to breed with the partner which we
choose for them - and often we wonder why the pair shows no interest in
breeding.
Cynthia Bluhm had 19 pairs of Canvasbacks which had chosen their
own partners, and ten pairs which were separated and given new partners.
In addition there were 12 females who had been actively courted but who
had not yet indicated their choice of males. Each of the latter was given a
drake who had not courted that particular duck. All birds had been raised
from artificially incubated eggs. Of the 19 self-formed pairs, 17 soon had
eggs. Of the 12 females who had been courted but had not accepted males,

ten co-existed peacefully with the males assigned to them but they did not
exchange courtship displays or lay eggs. The females who had been
separated from the males they had chosen became extremely aggressive
towards their new companions, chasing and pecking them. Five of these
unfortunate drakes died as a result. None of the other females accepted the
drakes forced on to them. Thus psychic factors inhibited mating in all
except the spontaneously formed pairs.

This 208-page guide to the birds of the island of Reunion is very
comprehensive and informative. It includes not only an extensive list of
the birds but descriptions of the terrain, climate, fauna and flora, as well as
the evolution of the island. A volcanic island in the southern Indian Ocean,
Reunion is the largest of the Mascarene Islands and covers an area of 2,512sq
km (approx. 970sq m). Of the 96 bird species found there, only 21 are
indigenous, 13 are passage migrants, 19 are occasional visitors and 16 are
introduced.
The detailed descriptions of plumage, habitat, nest, status and
distribution of all nesting, accidental and introduced species make
identification easier. Each species is listed under its scientific, French,
English and Creole name. The illustrations are good with the bird shown
alongside the text as well as on nine separate colour plates with others of
the same family group. The cartoon-like black and white drawings add
atmosphere and give a feel of the island. The reproductions of some old
plates - five in number and including one of the extinct Mascarene Parrot
Mascarinus mascarinus - are colourful and show clearly the difference in
bird illustrations of today and yesterday.
This is an interesting and informative guide for anyone intending to
visit this area but, as the book is entirely in French, a knowledge of the
language is necessary.
Oiseaux de la Reunion (ISBN 2-87868-027-8) is published by Les

Hand Rearing Parrots with Rosemary Low &amp; Rob Harvey.
Most aviculturists will be familiar with the names of the presenters of
this highly informative video. Rosemary Low, one of the world's leading
authorities on parrot-like birds, and Rob Harvey, Curator of Birdworld,
well-known for his work on incubation techniques, have put their expertise
to good use with the production of this guide to hand-rearing parrots. With
a running time of nearly an hour, the video proves an excellent format for
displaying the techniques of feeding parrot chicks, providing visual
instruction to those who may be new to this area of aviculture.
The video takes the aviculturist through the various stages of hand-
rearing, from the initial selection of a suitable brooder to dealing with the
more commonly found problems seen in hand-fed parrot chicks. The viewer
is shown when, how and what to feed the chick, how to monitor its
development and how to tackle the often problematic task of weaning. The
importance of hygiene within the nursery area is also suitably stressed, as
is the sense of commitment needed to undertake any form of hand-rearing.
The video also goes some way towards dispelling the myth that chicks
need to be fed every two hours throughout the night, something which is
definitely not necessary with the medium to large species, even small species
require only one feed during the night for the first few days.
The main advantage of the video format over the written word is that it
allows the viewer to actually witness a chick being fed, something which
some may find difficult to visualise from the text of a book. It is, perhaps,
the next best thing to hands-on tuition.
If there is any criticism of the title it is that breeders, if selling their
birds as pets, are advised to sell their youngsters whilst still on one feed,
thereby helping to keep the bird tame and encouraging a bond with its new
owner. This is a practice which can lead to problems for the inexperienced,
and may be disastrous for the bird itself. Otherwise, this is an excellent aid
for the would-be parrot rearer, and at only #15.95, represents a valuable
addition to the aviculturists' library.

Merley Bird Garden near Wimborne, Dorset, is closing after 30 years.
From a peak of 150,000 visitors a year in the 1980s, the number of visitors
has fallen to about 50,000 a year. The closure has also been blamed on a
break-in earlier this year when birds worth #20,000 (approx. US$ 12,500)
were stolen. The present stock, which includes a flock of Humboldt Penguins
Spheniscus humboldti, will be auctioned and the house and walled garden

'If you comply with the correct conditions there is no magic needed to

June 1997. His hummingbird accommodation (in Teteringen, in the
Netherlands) measures 17m x 3m (approx. 56ft x 10ft), with the main
room divided into 20 small aviaries, each measuring 115cm sq x 225cm
high (approx. 3ft 9V6in sq x 7ft 5in high), and serviced from a central
corridor. In these aviaries Jac Roovers has succeeded in breeding the Violet-
bellied Hummingbird Damophila julie, Amazilia Hummingbird Amazilia
amazilia , Fork-tailed Woodnymph Thalurania furcata and Violet-tailed
Sylph Aglaiocercus coelestis. He believes he is the first to breed the last
two in captivity, and is convinced that in time he can achieve more first
breedings with hummingbirds. One of the secrets of his success may be
that he lets the male in with the female just long enough for them to mate
a few times, then opens the hatch again and allows the male to fly back to
his own aviary.

THE BREEDING SEASON AT LORO PARQUE
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.955056206896552" page_id="56293956"  page_num="95" year="" vol="">
By the second week of June, over 500 chicks of more than 100 different
taxon had already been hatched. The two main highlights of the current
breeding season at the time Roger G. Sweeney wrote, were the first successful
breeding of the Plum-crowned Pionus Pionus tumultuosus and the Blue-
eyed Cockatoo Cacatua ophthalmica. 1997 has also seen the first stage of
the relocation of the majority of the breeding birds to a new breeding centre,
and it is pleasing to see that so far this has not affected the high levels of
breeding success which have been enjoyed in recent years.
The Musk Lory Glossopsitta concinna has for several years been in the
collection of the Loro Parque Foundation, but it is not until this year that
the first chicks have been produced. There had been several clutches of
infertile eggs until some of the pairing arrangements were changed last
winter. Other significant Loriidae species to be reared again include the
Red and Blue Lory Eos histrio , Mount Apo Lorikeet Trichoglossus
johnstoniae , Weber's Lorikeet T. haematodus weheri, Streseman's Lorikeet
T. h. stresemanni and Josephine's Lorikeet Charmosyna josefinae.
The cockatoo breeding season has included Loro Parque's first breeding
of the Blue-eyed Cockatoo, as mentioned earlier. Offspring have also been
produced by the Gang-gang Cockatoos Callocephalon fimbriatum. Red-
vented Cockatoos Cacatua haematuropygia. Major Mitchell's Cockatoos
C. leadbeateri, Ducorp's Cockatoos C. ducorps. Western Long-billed
Cockatoos C. pastinator , Slender-billed Cockatoos C. tenuirostris , Moluccan
Cockatoos C. moluccensis and Citron-crested Cockatoos C. sulphurea
citrinocristata, to name some of the more important species.
The Asian Blue-rumped Parrots Psittinus cyanurus which bred for the
first time at Loro Parque in 1996 have again produced young, as have a
number of other important Asian species, such as the Blue-naped Parrots
Tanygnathus lucionensis, Blue-backed Parrots T. sumatranus, Green-winged
King Parrots Alisterus chloropterus moszkowskii and Plum-headed

Parrakeets Psittacula cyanocephala. The New Caledonian Homed
Parrakeets Eunymphicus cornutus have again produced a single chick, with
a reliable pair of Moustached Parrakeets P alexandri making perfect foster-
parents for it. The African species which normally breed slightly later than
the rest of the psittacine collection in Tenerife were only just beginning
breeding, with a number of pairs of Vasa Parrots Coracopsis vasa nesting
and all of the Poicephalus spp. having chicks.
The macaws, Aratinga and Pyrrhura conures were all well into the
breeding season with many young being reared. The most important species
rearing young included Hyacinth Macaw Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus.
Blue-throated Macaw Ara glaucogularis , Red-fronted Macaw A.
rubrogenys, Illiger's Macaw A. maracana, Blue-throated Conure P.
cruentata and Crimson-bellied Conure P perlata perlata. The main hope
was to see a serious breeding attempt by the Spix's Macaw Cyanopsitta
spixii, which remains the collection's single most important species. All
three pairs of Hoffman's Conure P hoffmanni, sometimes called the Sulphur-
winged Conure, have settled in well after their arrival earlier this year
from the USA, but are probably too young to breed.
Roger Sweeney's personal highlight of the year so far, had been the
hatching of two Plum-crowned Pionus chicks, which were being reared by
an experienced pair of Maximilian's Parrots P. maximiliani. The placement
of the eggs with foster-parents was undertaken as a precaution because of
the importance of breeding the Plum-crowned Pionus and because the
natural parents lacked previous experience. It is also pleasing to report
that the pair of Plum-crowned Pionus were given eggs of Maximilian's
Parrot and succeeded in rearing a chick. It is hoped that next year the pair
of Plum-crowned Pionus can be left to rear their own offspring now that
they have shown that they are capable of doing so.
The Amazon parrot breeding season was also very much underway,
with a large number of young birds being reared from a variety of important
species which included the Red-browed Amazon Amazona rhodocorytha,
Vinaceous Amazon A. vinacea, Red-spectacled Amazon A. pretrei. Yellow-
faced AmazonA. xanthops, Lilacine Amazon A. autumnalis lilacina , Green-
cheeked Amazon A. viridigenalis. Yellow-shouldered Amazon A.
barbadensis, Bodin's Amazon A. festiva bodini and Yellow-headed Amazon
A. oratrix. One pair of Red-tailed Amazons A. brasiliensis had again laid
eggs, but so far all had proved infertile. A species which is high on Loro
Parque's priority list, the Purple-bellied Parrot Triclaria malachitacea, had
fledged young and it was hoped that as the current breeding season
progressed there would be further successes with many of the species
mentioned above.

It was hoped to publish in this issue details of next year's social meetings,
but to date it has not been possible to finalise the details. We are trying to
arrange a visit to see the bird collection at the Natural History Museum at
Tring, in late January or early February, and a visit to Paultons Park, Romsey,
Hants., on 4th April 1998. Hopefully the full details will be published in
the next magazine, along with details of other meetings in 1998.
The Society is extremely grateful to Dr. H. Quinque, of France, a

PARENT REARED TOCO TOUCANS AT LEEDS CASTLE
by Laura Paterson
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996939064516129" page_id="56293962"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
The Toco Toucan Ramphastos toco is one of the most popular and
well known species of birds, no doubt due here in Britain to a previous well
known advertising campaign for a popular brand of Irish stout. Despite
the Toco Toucan's popularity, however, very few of the 41 species of toucans
are represented in aviculture. The Toco is the largest and possibly the most
striking, with an enormous colourful bill, a white or pale yellow bib, a
white rump and red crissum.
In February 1989 Leeds Castle purchased a pair of Toco Toucans for its
newly opened memorial aviary. The aviary design comprises a planted
outside flight and a smaller inside shelter with a tubular heater and a light
on a timer for extended feeding hours. In late April three nest-boxes were
installed, two in the flight and one in the shelter. They measured 15in sq x
25in high (38cm sq x 63.5cm high) with an entrance hole Tin (18cm) in
diameter. Although interest was shown in the boxes initially this soon
waned and no attempt at breeding occurred until 1991. When preparing
the nest-boxes that year we considered changing the style or positions of
the boxes in order to generate more interest from the toucans. David Frank,
our Curator at that time, suggested placing cork tiles over the entrance
holes. The theory behind this being that the birds' natural curiosity would
call for a close inspection of this new feature whilst at the same time, by
picking off the cork from the holes, the birds' nesting behaviour would be
stimulated. The response to the cork tiles was immediate and both the
male and female quickly began to remove the tiles from all three nest-
boxes. The female kept returning to one particular box throughout this
period and was soon seen hopping into the box and banging on the wooden
interior. This behaviour continued for about two weeks, until the beginning
of June, when the female was no longer seen in the aviary. The male was
watched closely and he repeatedly flew up to the nest-box entrance and
looked into the box. Later that day the female was seen in the flight, but
returned to the nest almost straight away. On closer observation it became
clear that the female was going in and out of the nest frequently throughout

the day, often in response to some noise or disturbance. The particular
problem we faced was that Leeds Castle is a landmark used by the MOD
(Ministry of Defence) for low flying aircraft which caused the female to
bolt out of the nest-box. Unfortunately, by the time we decided to remove
the eggs for artificial incubation, both eggs had already been smashed inside
the box.
David Frank
Hand-reared chick being weighed in 1992
In 1992 a single egg was laid in the same nest-box and the decision was
taken to remove the egg for artificial incubation. In its place we put a
dummy egg which the female accepted, and she continued to sit. The
original egg was fertile and we decided to attempt to reintroduce the egg
once internal pip had been achieved. Unfortunately, the period between
the internal pip and the hatch was so quick that the opportunity was missed
and the chick was hand-reared.
Someone once said to me that if you have a healthy pair of birds which
are not breeding successfully the problem is you. I firmly believe that this
is true - either the birds are not being given what they require to make them
feel secure or some other factor is missing. It took us the next two seasons

to get to the bottom of the problem of the female bolting out of the box and
smashing her eggs. The solution, when it eventually occurred to us, was
incredibly obvious. If we heightened the box and hung it at an angle of
approximately 45 degrees, the female had the security of being much farther
from the entrance hole and if she wanted to exit the box, did not have to
jump, but simply hop up the incline to the hole.

Young Toco Toucan hatched at Leeds Castle in 1995
In 1995, a box of this design was erected in the aviary, again with cork
covering the entrance hole. Immediately interest was shown by both the
male and female and the cork was completely removed within an hour. On
the 4th June the female went into the slanting box and remained there all
day. The following day she came out of the nest-box when the keeper was
feeding the birds, but returned to the nest straight away. Disturbance was
kept to the minimum at this stage and the box was not inspected so as not
to risk putting the female off. Gradually she became more confident and
would simply come up to the entrance to see what was going on, then
return to her eggs.
On the 22nd June egg shell was found on the aviary floor and on

inspecting the nest, which the female allowed me to do without panicking,
two chicks approximately one to two days old were seen. Preceding the
hatching of the eggs a great deal of thought had gone into whether to feed
extra protein for the growing chicks or to simply continue with the 90%
fruit diet. It was agreed that extra protein should be offered and it should
be left to the parents to make their own selection of food items. The following
day locusts were offered to the parents and were accepted readily and taken
into the nest-box. On day three the diet of mainly fruit was supplemented
with balls of minced meat rolled in insectivorous mix, again these were
taken in preference to anything else and appeared to be regurgitated by the
parents and fed to the chicks. At this stage it was common for both of the
parents to be in the nest with the chicks, with the male taking over much of
the brooding. By the 4th July the chicks were growing well and becoming
more vocal. By the 20th July the quantity of food consumed by the Tocos
had doubled, we had not however increased the amount of animal protein.
One of the young was first seen looking out of the nest-box on the 1st
August. Except for the black feathering it was quite pale in colour and
resembled a toy more than a real toucan. Two weeks later the first youngster
(at eight weeks old) left the nest and the second followed the next day.
The first few days after fledging the young persistently begged for food
from the parents, but quickly began picking up and playing with food items
themselves. At this stage they were fed no meat or livefood whatsoever,
just soft exotic fruit and insectivorous mix at the ratio of four parts fruit to
one part insectivorous mix. The young were extremely playful and active
and no aggression was shown towards them by the parents. They remained
together for approximately seven months.
Shortly after bringing the young in for sexing one died. We had a post
mortem performed and the cause of death was confirmed as
pseudotuberculosis, probably the biggest killer of toucans in captivity. As
a precaution the other youngster (which went on to be reared successfully)
was treated with an antibiotic, as it was assumed that it too had been exposed
to the same bacteria. During the post mortem it was also noted that the
dead bird had a high level of iron in the liver, which although it had not
caused the death of the bird, may have been a contributory factor. The
insectivorous mix has now been replaced by low iron fruit pate.
It is difficult to draw too many conclusions from the death of a single
bird, however, in retrospect it may be wise in future to reduce the animal
protein offered to the chicks at a much earlier stage in their development.

THE RED-SPECTACLED AMAZON Amazona pretrei AT
LORO PARQUE
</sectionHeader>

by Roger G. Sweeney
The Red-spectacled Amazon is a fairly small member of the Amazona
genus measuring 31cm (1214in) long (Forshaw, 1989). Several adults were
weighed at Loro Parque, and the mean weight for this species was 276g
(range 252 - 30 Ig), with no clear difference between the sexes. In appearance
it is very similar to the closely-related Tucuman Amazon Amazona
tucumana, indeed many people still prefer to treat them as being conspecific.
Both species have mainly green plumage, distinctly edged with black. In
the Red-spectacled Amazon the entire forehead and crown is red, which
extends around the periophthalmic regions and provides this species with
its common name. There is also red on the thighs, bend of the wings and
primary flight feathers. The amount of red present around the
periophthalmic region and down the bend of the wings provides a good
guide to the gender of the birds once they are mature. While this is not
definite sexual dimorphism, it is normally true that the male has much
more extensive red coloration than the female. The Tucuman Amazon by
comparison, can be clearly separated in appearance by having only the
forehead and forecrown red and while it does have red primaries, it lacks
the strong red coloration on the bend of the wings. From personal
observations of captive birds I find the personality and behaviour of these
two species to be quite different, although these observations have still to
be quantified by further study.
The Red-spectacled Amazon has always been extremely rare in captivity
outside South America and is regarded as endangered in its natural state.
The most comprehensive study of the Red-spectacled Amazon in the wild
was published in 1994 and summarised the results of an intensive two-year
field study (Varty et al., 1994). The authors estimated a wild population of
between 7,500 and 8,500 birds. This population is now almost entirely
confined to the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. Although it is recorded
in various forested areas within its range, the species is found mainly in
areas of Acaucaria forest (Varty et al., 1994) and to a lesser extent in
deciduous and Atlantic forest. The wild population is still considered to be
declining at present but active in-situ conservation initiatives now being
planned may ensure that the population can be stabilised in the short term,
and in the long term population growth may allow this species to return to
some of its former locations from which it has disappeared in recent decades.

At Loro Parque one pair of young Red-spectacled Amazons are kept in
an exhibition aviary in the public area of the park, while several more pairs
are maintained in suspended breeding cages in the off-exhibit breeding
areas of the collection. The exhibition aviary is of an open design, made
mainly of wire mesh panels secured to a metal framework, as can be seen
in the accompanying photograph of our exhibition Amazona aviaries. Each
one is surrounded by dense Arreca Palms to act as a vision break around
three sides of the aviary, allowing the birds to be seen only from the front.
The suspended breeding cages used in the off-exhibit breeding areas measure
300cm in length and 95cm in both width and height (approx. 9ft lOin x 3ft
Exhibition aviaries for Amazona species
Wim x 3ft Wim). The cages are suspended above the ground with the base
of each cage approximately 125cm (4ft l(4in) above the pathway, which
allows the inhabitants of the cage to perch just above the head height of the
keeper. The Canary Islands have a sub-tropical climate and every cage in
the collection has a shower system included in the design which is turned
on for a 15 minute period each day in the late morning or early afternoon.
In the morning at 7am each adult pair receive approximately 90g of a
mixed salad which contains apple, pear, orange, carrot, banana, chard,
watercress, red pepper, beetroot, tomato, papaya, fruit of the Queen Palm

and other seasonally available items. Also in the morning each pair is
given approximately 30g of a commercial pelleted food. In the afternoon
at 3pm the second feed of the day is provided which consists of about 80g
of a mixture of cooked beans (pulses), com, lentils, sunflower seeds, millet,
oats and mixed smaller seeds. Drinking water is supplied fresh from a
purified source which is prepared by first being chlorinated then passed
through a reverse-osmosis machine and finally through an ultra-violet light
steriliser.
A pair of Red-spectacled Amazons at Loro Parque
The Red-spectacled Amazon has been part of the collection at Loro
Parque since the early 1980s, however, the first breeding was not recorded
until 1990 when a single chick was reared. In the same year the nearby
collection at Palmitos Park on Gran Canaria also recorded its first successful
breeding (Low, 1991). Following the initial breeding at Loro Parque in
1990, a population of 26 birds has been built up in the past six years.
Elsewhere in Europe this species is seldom seen in aviculture; three other
zoological collections currently keep this species - Vogelpark Walsrode and
Dresden Zoo in Germany and Palmitos Park in Spain. Breeding has now
been recorded at both Palmitos Park and Dresden Zoo, while the birds at
Walsrode have laid eggs but have not yet reared young. The general
population trend is therefore now moving very positively upwards. As a

species, the Red-spectacled Amazon is a lively and active member of the
Amazona genus and in common with many of the smaller-sized Amazona
species, it also demonstrates a strong instinct to breed in captivity. It is
interesting to observe that many parrot species at Loro Parque seem to
undergo a much extended breeding season, probably due to the constant
sub-tropical climate of the Canary Islands. Species of the Amazona genus
are however still quite seasonal in their breeding behaviour and the Red-
spectacled Amazon has a very clear breeding season with 32 hatchings
recorded in Europe in the past six years taking place between April and
June, and just a single hatching recorded in early July.

Seasonal hatching of Red-spectacled Amazons in Europe
The clutch sizes recorded from birds at Loro Parque are relatively large
for an Amazona species, with an average of four eggs per clutch (range 3-
6 eggs). One breeding pair at Loro Parque succeeded in hatching six chicks
from each clutch for the last two years. Reports from wild nests (Varty et
ak, 1994) state that between 2-4 chicks were normally found.
At Loro Parque, on occasions when large clutches are laid and confirmed
as fertile, one or two eggs are removed to leave the parents with no more

than a potential four chicks. We have seen signs of parental aggression in
this species which, when the number of chicks being reared is reduced,
does not occur. The incubation period is 26 days, with the main incubation
being undertaken by the female. Egg dimensions were calculated from a
sample of 16 eggs laid by four different females at Loro Parque. These
produced the mean measurement of 343mm x 26.5mm (range 32.8mm -
36.0mm x 23.7mm - 28.9mm).
Newly-hatched chicks normally weigh between 6-7g and growth
development is quite rapid with parent-reared chicks fledging from seven
weeks onwards. Upon fledging, the chicks are clearly identified as immature
as, compared to their parents, they have much reduced red coloration on
the crown of the head and on the wing feathers. In the last three years,
nearly all the Red-spectacled Amazon reared at Loro Parque have been
either parent-reared or [osier -reared by other closely-related Amazona
species; only once in 1996 did a chick have to be hand-reared from hatching.
This chick was hand-reared successfully in our nursery department, where
it was fed on Pretty Bird hand-rearing formula and its pattern of weight
gain development during the first five weeks of its life is illustrated in the
accompanying graph.

As the captive population of the Red-spectacled Amazon continues to
grow in Europe, it is likely that soon more zoological collections and
aviculturists will have the opportunity to keep and breed this species. An
unofficial studbook is already in operation between the four European
collections which keep this species (Loro Parque, Palmitos Park, Dresden
Zoo and Vogelpark Walsrode) and this may now receive official backing
from the European Association of Zoos, as the population of Red-spectacled
Amazons continues to grow and be placed in a larger number of specialised
collections. Apart from the species visual attractiveness, its lively behaviour
and willingness to breed will without doubt ensure that any birds which
become available will be greatly sought after. However care should be
taken, at least in the near future to ensure that only collections willing to
participate in cooperative management of the species be given first option
to work with the Red-spectacled Amazon, as the current genetic status of
the population is bias towards the offspring of three or four highly successful
pairs.

EVALUATION OF PAIR-BOND STRENGTH IN CRANES

To have a successful captive crane breeding programme requires that
crane pairs exhibit a strong pair bond. Without this critical component, a
pair is not as likely to put effort into territorial vigilance. Without strong
territoriality, the likelihood of the female going into reproductive mode is
greatly reduced. Why would cranes invest so much energy into breeding
and then chick rearing for several months if they did not have a secure
territory from which to guarantee the transmission of their genes? At the
International Crane Foundation (ICF) we look for clues which tell whether
or not a pair of cranes shares a strong pair bond. You know it when you see
it usually, but by using several different indicators one can be more confident
in gauging pair-bond status, when to split up pairs, and when to leave
them alone.

Pair-Bond Strength Indicators
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9805791" page_id="56293972"  page_num="107" year="" vol="">
The following is a short list of indicators of strong or at the least healthy
developing pair bonds. The more that all indicators are noticed, the more
confident one can be of the pair-bond strength needed for successful egg-
laying.
Unison call
An antiphonal (back and forth) duet between male and female. The
male emits one note to the female's one, two or three notes depending on
the species. Heads usually are tilted up, primaries may be drooped in the
male. This is a territorial proclamation which also serves to reinforce pair-
bond strength following copulation. This is the surest sign that a pair
shares a strong pair-bond (Figure a).
Territorial vigilance
Of the 42 crane pairs currently on site, the most successful and consistent
egg-laying pairs exhibit strong territorial defence. This includes charging
into pen fences, following aviculturists along the pen perimeter or attacking
them. Others may only resort to a combination of postural threats (Figure
b) or the unison call.
Contact call
A soft e prrf sound made without opening the beak. This is an occasional
call within the pair, often emitted when engaged in activities such as foraging

A strong pair spends the great majority of time within a short distance
of each other. This is true for all 15 species of cranes. A pair is strongest
this way, especially when one bird can back up and defend the other, their
territory or chicks. Another reason they may stay so close to each other is
that a lone bird might otherwise appear to be a single bird in need of a
mate. This would create an opportune moment for an outside single bird
looking to 'hook up'. This explanation of close proximity is plausible
considering events in the wild. Nesbitt (1987) documented a wild female
Sandhill Crane Grus canadensis harassing an already established pair from
the edge of their territory. She followed by attacking the female and then
soliciting the male in precopulatory fashion. This attempt to gain a mate,
and presumably its territory, seems to occur more often to pairs with weak
pair bonds or low nesting success - two related factors. The mean distance

between males and females at ICF is around 2m (6ft Tin). They are usually
about 1m - 1.5m (1ft Sin - 4ft 11 in) apart during activities such as territory
defence, roosting, loafing, preening, foraging, and dancing.

Dance
The general public understands dance behaviour to be a 'mating ritual'.
It is associated with mating, but also may serve other functions. Dance in
cranes is largely a string of threat behaviours thrown together in such a
way as to express nervous tension or elation depending on the circumstances.
A strong pair will exhibit dance often, with both birds participating freely
and neither bird controlling the dance through intimidation. If there Is
little or no dancing (look for it especially after sunrise or in the evening),
this is not suggestive of a strong pair bond. But, just because a pair may
dance often, it does not mean that the pair mull necessarily experience
reproductive success either.

Location Call Test
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994822176470588" page_id="56293975"  page_num="110" year="" vol="">
Looking at just one of the criteria listed above may not give an accurate
description of pair bond strength. It is best to closely observe all aspects of
a crane pair-bond. If one feels that a certain pair does not share a strong
pair-bond based on the above criteria, they can to a degree, measure pair
bond strength with the 'location call test'. In this test, the male and female
cranes are separated from each other. One of them is placed in a pen
neither immediately adjacent to the original pen, nor out of auditory range.
During this process, make sure there are no other nearby stressors which
may affect each bird, such as visual access to other cranes. After giving the
cranes several minutes to calm down, listen for what is called the 'location
call'. This is a single note call sounding similar to a guard call (listen for
the guard call when a crane has been startled and exhibits alert behaviour,
yet still cannot identify or locate the source of disturbance). In Grus sp.
the location call is usually slightly longer and more drawn out than the
guard call. If neither bird location calls, the bond is probably not that
strong. If only one bird emits the location call to try to find its mate, one
may infer that the cranes probably do not feel the same way about each
other, for this is not a strong pair bond characteristic. Look also to see if a
calling bird is frantically pacing its pen to try to get closer to its separated
mate. If this is not the case, review the pair with regard to the other pair-
bond indicators to decide whether it is worth keeping the pair together.
The location call test is used at ICF usually as the last test to confirm or
refute what we have already been thinking about the pair-bond of a particular
pair. If both birds appear to be desperately trying to get back to each other
and are also location calling, we will place them back together and re-
evaluate in a few months. The location call test may possibly even strengthen
a pair bond upon repairing both cranes, though we have not experimented
with this theory.
Using the above criteria and the location call test, ICF has been successful
in managing pairs towards maximum breeding potential by splitting up
those with questionable pair-bonds and repairing them. At the same time
we are assured that we are not simply splitting up a promising pair which
may only need more time to fully exhibit all indicators of a strong pair
bond.

CONSERVATION ON THE SANGIHE AND TALAUD
ISLANDS

by Jon Riley
Indonesia is a biodiversity hot spot. It has the world's fourth most
diverse avifauna and the dubious privilege of being ranked first in global
terms with respect to the number of threatened species it supports (Collar
et al., 1994). Perhaps one of the most important areas for bird conservation
in Indonesia is the Sangihe-Talaud Archipelago, which stretches north from
Sulawesi in central Indonesia towards the Philippines.
Over the last three years I have organised Action Sampiri, an Anglo-
Indonesian project that has gathered basic biological information from
Sangihe and Talaud and sought to use this information to develop a
conservation education-awareness programme. The project takes its title
from the local name of the beautiful Red and Blue Lory Eos histrio, one of
six bird species that are found on Sangihe and Talaud and nowhere else in
the world (Riley, 1997a).
Prior to Action Sampiri, there was a paucity of information about the
islands and their birds. Few biologists had reached this remote area, the
northern extremity of Indonesia. What little information that existed often
originated from the last century; recent, reliable data were lacking. However,
analysis by Birdlife International, the global conservation organisation,
suggested that seven bird species found on Sangihe and Talaud were
threatened with extinction (Collar et ah, 1994). In 1992 the islands were
designated an Endemic Bird Area (EBA) highlighting their global
conservation significance (ICBR 1992).
In 1995 Action Sampiri mounted a successful six month expedition to
the islands which gathered baseline data and investigated the need for
practical conservation initiatives. The main conclusion of our 1995 work
was that all endemic species were probably extant, although facing immense
pressures to their survival. Using this information, and data gathered by
other workers, we planned a second project between October 1996 and
April 1997. This unique and ambitious proposal aimed to combine further
research into threatened bird species and their habitats with community-
based conservation work to increase awareness amongst local people of
conservation issues on Sangihe and Talaud.
Our primary goal was to try to ensure the continued existence of the
islands' endemic birds and their forest habitats. Action Sampiri piloted
many new ideas and tried to find effective methods to raise public awareness
about, and concern for, the islands' special birds. Plans were constantly
revised in light of responses to our activities, new ideas from team members

and new information resulting from research. The project attempted to
adopt a 'bottom up' approach, letting the community play a central role in
conservation on the islands, rather than leaving solutions in the hands of
outsiders.
In 1996/1997 research focused on three key sites identified in 1995 as
priority areas for bird conservation on the islands. Results were exciting:
we confirmed the presence of all threatened bird species and provided
evidence confirming the existence and validity of a sixth endemic species.

the main threat to this charismatic bird, through informal interviews with
residents and by direct observations. Trapping is the major factor threatening
the species at present. Action Sampiri gave estimates in local meetings of
a total Karakelang (and thus world) population of 5,000-10,000 Eos histrio,
with c. 1,000 birds being lost to trade in 1996. In 1995, the endemic Sangihe
race E. h. histrio was rediscovered at Talawid. No observations of the race
were made in 1996 (see Lambert, 1997). Local inhabitants suggested this
was not the right season for seeing it, but in meetings held on Sangihe-
Talaud, we stated the Sangihe race of this endemic species to be extinct.
We recommend upgrading the Red and Blue Lory to critical.
Blue-naped Parrot Tanygnathus lucionensis
The Talaud race of Blue-naped Parrot T. 1. talautensis was regularly
encountered in primary forest and an unfledged juvenile was photographed
in northern Karakelang in mid-March. Karakelang supports an important
population of this species, which appears to be widespread at low densities.
The species is likely to be demoted to near-threatened in the forthcoming
Asia Bird Red Data Book (J. C. Lowen verbally 1997).
Sangihe Hanging Parrot Loriculus catamene
Sangihe Hanging Parrot was found to be present in all areas visited. It
has apparently adapted to habitat changes that have accrued from forest

Nine near-threatened species have been recorded within the Sangihe

few records: Far Eastern Curlew Numenius madagascariensis and Chestnut-
cheeked Starling Sturnus philippensis; a third, Great-billed Heron Ardea
sumatrana is only known from historical records (White &amp; Bruce, 1986;
Riley in press).
Schrenck 9 s Bittern Ixohrychus eurhythmus
A winter visitor to Wallacea that, in the EBA has been recorded on

the bittern was occasionally observed in open secondary forest and cultivated
areas.
Malaysian Plover Charadrius peronii
Only recorded from beaches in northern Karakelang, with observations
from three sites. These records, in 1995 and 1997, are the first from within
the EBA.
Nicobar Pigeon Caloenas nicobarica
There are historical records of this small island specialist from Sangihe,
Siau and Talaud. The few recent records are from Karakelang where the
pigeon is apparently uncommon and restricted to primary forest.
Talaud Kingfisher Halcyon enigma
Ecological data were gathered on the endemic Talaud Kingfisher,
supporting the opinion (see e.g. White &amp; Bruce, 1986) that this species
has undergone speciation and merits specific status. The kingfisher was
regularly observed in primary forest and degraded forest on Karakelang
and Salibabu.
Pied Cuckoo-shrike Coracina bicolor
A record on Gunung Sahengbalira was the first on Sangihe since the
nineteenth century. Given this single observation, the cuckoo-shrike is
assumed to be rare.

Rail Gymnocrex sp.
One sighting was made of an undescribed taxon of Gymnocrex rail in
marshy cultivation near Beo in March 1997. Dr. F. R. Lambert collected a
specimen of this taxon in September 1996, which apparently represents a
species new to science. A paper providing details of this taxon is in
preparation. If confirmed, the rail will become the seventh species endemic
to Sangihe and Talaud (F. Lambert in lift. 1997).
Lilac-cheeked Kingfisher Cittura cyanotis
On Sangihe, Lilac-cheeked Kingfisher C. c. sanghirensis - a little known
endemic race - was frequently observed, extensive ecological information
was gathered and two individuals trapped and blood samples taken.
Black-fronted White-eye Zosterops atrifrons
Field observations of the Sangihe race of Black-fronted White-eye Z. a.
nehrkorni were made on the Gunung Sahengbalira ridge. This race was
previously known only from the type specimen collected last century, but
since mislaid (White &amp; Bruce, 1986).
Golden Bulbul Ixos affinis

Perhaps more encouraging was the impact of the education programme.
In all the villages we visited, people were fascinated to learn about their
special birds and the problems they face.
On Sangihe we opened a Bird Information Centre in Tamako, the largest
town closest to Mt Sahengbalira, converting a shop into a walk-in area
equipped with educational resources including books, posters and picture
boards. The centre was staffed by project members and received over 800
visitors in the course of six weeks. We also visited ten schools and gave
talks about the island's endemic birds to a total of almost 1,500 pupils aged
between five and 18 years old. An awareness campaign in the village of
Ulung Peliang, close to Sangihe's largest forest area, resulted in a village
law being passed to protect remaining natural habitat.
On the Talaud Islands our work concentrated on Karakelang, the largest
island in the archipelago, and the home of the vast majority of the world
population of Red and Blue Lory Eos histrio. Education work took place
in three broad areas: communities, local government and schools.

Community meetings were held in nine villages on the island about the
conservation of Eos histrio. Each was attended by approximately 100 people.
Following these meetings, five villages wrote letters to the Regent of Sangihe
and Talaud, requesting an area law be passed to protect Eos histrio. These
letters were personally delivered to the Regent by the Action Sampiri team.
Meetings with bird trappers were made in the six main trapping villages
on Karakelang, to attempt to find a solution to the problem of unsustainable
trapping of birds on the island. A senior trapper from Tuabatu village
joined Action Sampiri for six weeks, becoming an integral member of the
conservation education team,
A seminar about the conservation needs of Red and Blue Lory Eos
histrio for local government officials was held in Beo, capital of the Talaud
Islands, in February 1997. This was attended by district councillors, village
heads and representatives of the police, the army and education department
officials. We discussed the conservation of Red and Blue Lory Eos histrio
and possible solutions, asking for opinions and ideas from local people.
Action Sampiri met with the government head of all four districts on
Karakelang Island, and with the Regent of Sangihe and Talaud to discuss
conservation of the islands' endemic birds, particularly Eos histrio. We
are working towards the implementation of a law that would ban any trade
in, or trapping of, Red and Blue Lory Eos histrio .
Finally, talks about Red and Blue Lory Eos histrio and its conservation
were given to almost 2,000 pupils in 16 schools. Some children were
invited to join the project, learn some basic birdwatching skills and
experience our work first-hand.
With the bird trade being a specific threat to the islands' endangered
parrots, Action Sampiri also undertook some work in the provincial capital
of North Sulawesi, Man a do Specifically, we worked with undergraduates
from Universitas Sam Ratulangi and in total 12 students joined the project
as counterpart scientists. We organised a birdwatching training workshop
for local students at Tongkaina, just outside Manado, on 20th - 22nd
December 1996. Twenty-five students attended the three day event, four
later joining the project on Talaud for two weeks. We introduced students
to the basics of bird identification, provided training in making field notes,
using binoculars and other aspects of fielder aft., and provided a focal point
for students from different institutes to meet and discuss birdwatching.
Action Sampiri also worked with local media. We made three, two
hour appearances on the local Radio Smart FM 's Golden Age chat show
broadcast over Manado, Bitung and Minahasa, An article about Action
Sampiri 5 s project on Sangihe and Talaud appeared in the Manado Post
newspaper in October 1996.

Did our approach work? In just six months we did not expect to see
major changes on Sangihe and Talaud, but we have laid strong foundations
for future work. In all villages, without exception, we were afforded great
hospitality and our project was greeted with enthusiasm and interest. It is
almost impossible to measure &amp;apos;progress' in a project of this nature, but
communities living adjacent to Mt Sahengbalira have passed village laws
banning the further clearance of primary forest; trappers from Tuabatu are
thought to have significantly reduced capture rates of Red and Blue Lories
and in April 1997, Action Sampiri were able to present the head of
government on Sangihe-Talaud with letters from seven village and district
heads calling for the implementation of a law banning trade in Red and
Blue Lories. Such progress was made possible by an interaction of factors:
a knowledge of the islands and their people, gained in 1995, was vital; the
combination of UK students, students from the local university in Manado
and local people was very effective, all groups learning much from each
other during the project; closely combining our research and awareness
programmes gave great credibility to the data we presented in village
meetings and an ability to adapt to local work patterns, accepting
bureaucratic formalities as necessary, benefited our work in the long-term.
But of paramount importance was the willingness of local people to listen,
absorb information, question our statements and take positive action. The
conservation problems we are trying to address were created inadvertently
by the islands' residents, it is clear to us that they should be part of the
solution.
Plans are now being developed for a return to Sangihe and Talaud as
the situation on these islands, particularly with respect to the over
exploitation of the Red and Blue Lory, is changing rapidly and despite the
successes enjoyed by Action Sampiri, the future of all endangered species
on the islands is far from secure.

Pittas have long been popular avicultural subjects, which given the
right conditions do well, except this is when it comes to breeding. Breeding
successes remain relatively uncommon, probably due mainly to the fact
that the male and female are so notoriously difficult to house together.
This account of the breeding of the Hooded Pitta Pitta sordida cucullata
by the late Jean Delacour, selected by Ron Oxley, was first published in
the magazine in 1934. A few years later M. Delacour also succeeded in
breeding Elliot&amp;apos;s Pitta P. ellioti. The next success to be reported in the
magazine was probably not until 1962, when Charles Everitt described the
breeding of the Bengal Pitta P. brachyura in 1961 in Edward Marshall
Boehm&amp;apos;s aviaries at Trenton, New Jersey, USA (Avicultural Magazine, 68,
1:33-35). Then in 1973, S. T. Johnstone reported the breeding of the Blue-
winged Pitta P. moluccensis in 1972 at the Wildfowl Trust, Slimbridge
(Avicultural Magazine, 79, 4:129 and 79, 6:229). It was thought to be the
first species of pitta to be bred in the UK. This pitta is treated sometimes
as a race of the Bengal species and sometimes as a full species in its own
right. At least two other species have been bred in the UK, the Hooded
Pitta at Birdland, Bourton-on-the-Water and the Banded Pitta P. guajana
at Blackpool Zoo. If you know of other successes elsewhere, perhaps you
will write and provide details.
It should be noted that the scientific name of the Hooded Pitta is now P.
sordida. P. s. cucullata is one of 12 races of it listed by Howard and Moore
(1980). -Ed.

Pitta cucullata
by J. Delacour
Although many species of pittas have been introduced into Europe during
the last 20 years, most of them very beautiful, none had so far bred or even
nested in captivity.
Pittas are forest birds, living on the ground and only perching at night,
and have insectivorous habits. They hop about noisily on the carpet of
dead leaves, not wild, but often difficult to see. It was clear that a thickly
planted aviary, with a moist atmosphere, was the only accommodation to
try to induce them to nest, and I always thought my greenhouse aviaries
were very suitable for the purpose. In fact, since the beginning, I always
kept in them some pittas, in perfect condition. Their feet, which are very
tender, kept in good order, and their colours, which often fade in cages,
remained as bright as they are when at liberty.
Pittas prove quite harmless to other birds, even as small as

hummingbirds, but they are most intolerant to one another. It is almost
impossible to keep two together, even in a large aviary and male and female
of the same species, and this has been the principal obstacle to their breeding
in confinement. In the early spring of 1933, however, I succeeded in keeping
together two Hooded Pittas Pitta cuculiata, a species which is often imported
from India and extends to Indo-China and the Malay Peninsula. Both
sexes are alike, of a pretty, soft green colour with a black and chestnut
head, a crimson belly, and lovely shining blue patches on the wings and
rump.
There was no doubt that the smaller bird was a female, as it had dropped
a couple of eggs shortly after it had arrived. The other one was taller, with
a stronger bill, and gave the impression of being a male, rightly enough.
At a few days' intervals, in May 1933, both birds were let out in a large
compartment of the tropical aviaries, 40ft x 15ft (approx. 12.2m x 4.5m)
with a temperature of 65*-90*F (18.3*-32.2*C) all the year round. It is
thickly furnished with tropical plants, and contains a blue waterlily pooh
There are some 40-50 hummingbirds, sunbirds, and small insectivorous
species, as well as a dozen Chinese Quails. None of them seems to be
noticed by the pittas.
Each bird kept in a comer, under the thick vegetation; both were always
quite tame, and readily fed at one's feet. When they met there was nothing
more serious than a short fight, and for months they lived as far apart as
they could from one another, in a state of armed peace. On 10th April
1934, the male started calling loudly from the top of a tree, where he seldom
ascended before, and such serious struggles took place that I was almost
obliged to separate the pittas; but at the same time they were seen casually
picking up and carrying about nesting materials. I left them alone, and by
20th April they began to build a nest on the top of a dry stone wall, all
covered with plants, about 4ft (approx. 1.2m) high. The male was the first
and principal worker, but the female helped also. There were no more
disputes now between them.
As the pittas were pulling out plants and roots, I provided them with
small sticks, hay, dead leaves, and moss. All were used, and by the 20th
the main work was completed. The nest, as is well known, at liberty, is a
covered-up affair, the size of a football, with a large opening in front, level
with the ground. The pittas then worked at the inside, lining it with fibres,
moss, rootlets, and decayed leaves. On the 30th I saw the male feeding the
female. The first egg was laid on 2nd May; it was short and rather rounded
at both ends, white, spotted with pale reddish brown. Eggs were laid the
next three days, and both sexes sat tightly ori 6th May, frequently replacing
one another every hour or so. Being very tame, one could touch them in
the nest, but sometimes they became annoyed, and flew savagely at one's
face.

The first egg hatched on 18th May; on the 20th there were three young
birds, the fourth egg containing a well-developed chick dead in the shell.
A curious circumstance is that the chicks almost immediately poke their
head out from their parent's breast, and even come out on the edge of the
nest, probably on account of the heat. The result was that, twice in a few
hours, I found one of them fallen on the ground below the wall. I put it
back, without injury, but to avoid further accidents I built in front of the
nest a small platform of sticks and hay, where they could comfortably disport
themselves, and no more trouble occurred.
The chicks are naked, of a reddish flesh colour, the fore part of the head
being black; the bill is orange yellow, as is the gape. Both parents fed the
chicks mostly on cut up bullock's heart, with mealworms, a few earthworms,
and insectile mixture. They are not difficult to feed, and I believe meat
alone would be sufficient to rear them. Naturally they always had a liberal
supply of it. On 24th May one young one disappeared, and was never
found.
Feather sheaths quickly appeared, and the growth of the youngsters
was very quick. They came out more and more on the platform now, so
much so that on the 31st one was out of the nest, flying well enough. The
weaker one also came out, but was found half drowned in the pond, and
just saved. A small screen was put up to avoid further accidents. But it
was to no avail, and this same young pitta was drowned on 5th June, after
having been flying well for several days. Both parents fed the remaining
young bird devotedly, and did not abandon and bully it as I had feared, as
the mother had started laying again in the old nest on the 31st, while the
male began another nest, further away, in a similar situation. Probably on
account of the stimulating food, the female laid every day, as many as ten
eggs, by 12th June. She insisted on laying in the old nest, and all but one
egg dropped on the ground. The old nest had been kept very clean, the
parents taking right away the droppings of the chicks, but the male had by
then completed the new nest and would not go to the old one again. The
birds were not sitting. On 13th June I removed the old nest and put eight
eggs into the new one (I thought ten were too many). Very docile, the
female went to the new nest and incubation started immediately. Two
eggs, probably addled, were rejected after a few days. At the same time,
both parents continued feeding their first young, now quite strong, and
eating also by himself since 12th June. However, on the 21st 1 took him by
hand (he is very tame), and removed him into another compartment, where
he now lives happily.
The first plumage of the young Hooded Pitta is as follows: top of the
head streaked dark brown and dull chestnut; underparts earthy brown, rather
pale; belly and vent pale pink; nape black, upperparts blackish green; quills,

as in the adults, but duller; greater wing coverts dull black with whitish
terminal and subterminal spots; lesser wing coverts blackish green; rump
pale blue; bill brown with tip and gape yellow; legs and feet greyish pink.
Green feathers appeared very soon, and by 20th June had almost
completely replaced the brown ones on the underparts. A complete moult
into adult plumage took place on the beginning of August.
On 23rd June the head of the chick was observed, and four the following
day. At once a platform was built in front of the nest. On 11th July, on my
return from the Ornithological Congress at Oxford, the four young pittas
were out of the nest, and they all have been fully reared.
But we now come to the sad end of the story, and we shall see that, like
the thrushes, pittas have the most wicked and puzzling temper.
As soon as the young ones had left the nest, the male pitta, whose
plumage, and especially the quills, were in a very worn state, started at
once building another nest, this time on the ground, but against the wall. I
provided him with the necessary materials; the female helped a little and,
by 15th July, the nest was almost completed. I noticed that day that there
was a fight between the two parents, but I thought it was only, as usual, an
introduction to their mating, and paid little attention to it. The next day
the female was chasing the male, who kept hidden most of the time, and I
decided to keep a special watch on the pittas. I went into the greenhouse
every hour or so, to see how matters were going on; it was very much the
same. But at the end of the day the male was found dead in the pond.
There is no doubt that the female, whose wings and other feathers were
still perfect, pushed him into the water, and prevented him from getting
out. He was in perfect health otherwise, and had no visible wounds.
The female has not laid up to now; it is very probable that the male
wanted to breed again; but she refused to do so, hence the struggle with its
tragic end. She carried on feeding the young ones and still is looking after
them most devotedly to this day.
I only hope that, among the young birds, there will be a male to replace
his father. I have also got now a pair of Macklot's Pittas in my greenhouses.
But I have only three compartments large enough and suitable for the
breeding of pittas.

Pitta sordida cucullata
by D. M. Reid-Henry
This beautiful bird hails from the jungle-covered hills and mountains
of Assam, Burma, Malaysia, and Siam.
Like most of the family it is a creature of the undergrowth where it
occupies its time in scuffling about amongst the wet and decaying vegetation
in the search of insects and grubs, spiders, worms, and small reptiles. These,
with a few berries and other fruit, represent its diet-sheet. When appetite
is satisfied the bird finds a perch on some fallen log or moss-covered boulder
and spends considerable time if undisturbed preening or just sitting still.
When alarmed it slips quietly away, flying low for a short distance to a
more secure position. The usual mode of progress for pittas is by means of
a succession of prodigious hops with intervals between, when they stand
erect on their long legs to listen or to look for food. They do not leave the
forest undergrowth from choice during the day, but at night they mount
high into trees to roost.
In a previous article, when I wrote of the Bengal Pitta {Avicultural
Magazine , Vol. 64), I mentioned much in the way of general details about
these birds, and I will content myself and, I hope, the readers by simply
referring to that article. What would apply in the case of that bird also
holds good here, at any rate as regards habits and treatment in captivity.
However, as pittas of one sort or another are now more easily obtainable
than they have been in the past I would like to recommend them to any
serious aviculturist who has some experience of keeping softbills. They do
equally well in either planted aviary or a large cage provided they are kept
warm and with a soft floor. A good insectivorous food supplemented with
snails, centipedes, mealworms, or any other garden-inhabiting gentry will
keep them well satisfied, whilst a barrow-load of dead leaves (preferably
moist and well decayed) along with some rotting wood will give the owner
some fine chances to watch the bird in action. Without this natural rubbish
the bird will probably spend the day hidden as far from view as it can
escape.
I only once possessed one of this species - in Calcutta, but I have seen
many in other peoples' possession, and it was from one such bird, a perfectly
tame and confiding creature, that I was able to make the drawings for the
accompanying coloured plate.
About this plate I would like to make one point. Somewhere along the
line of reproduction the green of the back has become too light. There is

considerable difference between the bluish-green of the underparts which
is a rather pale colour, and the dark, slightly slaty-green of the back and
wings. The illustration does not show this contrast at all well.
There are three races of this pitta in Malaysia, and altogether about
eight have been separated.
Pitta sordida mulleri which breeds in Java, Sumatra, and Borneo, has a
black crown. P. s. hangkana , the form found breeding in Banka and Billiton
has brown on the sides of the crown.
P. 5 . cucullata, the subject of the plate, comes from the north of the
range for the species, but migrates into many areas occupied by other races.
In all the brown-headed forms, the base of the crown feathers are black so
that some confusion may arise in identification when the feathers are puffed
up, because the black bases then become apparent and a more or less distinct
black line through the centre of the crown from bill to nape appears. It is
this feature which I have tried to bring out in the plate, and is very clearly
to be seen when the bird is at rest.

AVICULTURE'S GOLDEN AGE
by Frank Woolham
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998761131578948" page_id="56293991"  page_num="126" year="" vol="">
Students of the game are usually agreed that the years around the turn
of the century, when the likes of Grace, Ranji, Fry, Woolley, MacLaren,
Rhodes, Hirst and other 'greats' bestrode English grounds, constituted
cricket's golden age. Other sports have also produced outstanding
performers who contributed to memorable occasions in soccer, rugby, tennis,
athletics and many other activities. But what about aviculture, by no stretch
of the imagination a pastime demanding the expenditure of much energy -
but one which has not only brought pleasure to millions but undoubtedly
added considerably to our knowledge of birds?
I suspect the years between the two world wars - and perhaps a few
more in the post-1945 era - come very close to being aviculture's golden
period. Many of the great collections had been or were in process of being
assembled - Cleres, Foxwarren Park, Woburn, Keswick and Leckford were
among those leading the way in Europe, with others appearing in many
parts of the world including the USA, Australia and various south-east
Asian countries. Such eminent aviculturists as Delacour, Ezra, Gurney
and Spedan Lewis, together with many public collections around the world,
relied heavily on the expertise of a handful of collectors, people like Frost,
Webb, Porter, Cordier, Goodwin, Goodfellow and Shaw Mayer - and, of
course, Delacour himself who travelled widely, particularly, but not solely,
in Indochina.
I met only two of this particular quintet - Cecil Webb and Wilfred Frost.
On a visit to London Zoo with the late Gerald Durrell we bumped into
Webb in the Bird House - and spent several hours talking to him, attempting
to soak up some of his enormous knowledge of the care and management
of exotic birds in the critical period after capture. For me it was as rewarding
an avicultural tutorial as I can remember - for Gerry, who was then planning
his first expedition to West Africa, it was of rather more immediate value
and...well, let us just say that we talked of nothing other than our meeting
throughout a five-hour rail journey back to Manchester (trains really were
slower in those days)!
Much of our conversation with Webb centred on the birds of West Africa,
a region with which he was very familiar, and years later, locked away at
the back of my mind, I had good reason to remember some observations he
offered to Gerry Durrell about a particular bird of which, up to that time
and for some subsequent years, I had no knowledge. The species in question

encountered in Africa and how he had to have small boys regularly collecting
livefood for them. Some 30 years later I purchased an imported pair of
these interesting birds and the vendor (with refreshing candour) warned
me that all they had consumed while in his hands was water and mealworms.
Fortunately it was at a time when locusts were becoming more readily
available from a few sources - and how relieved I was to have been involved
in that earlier discussion. People like Webb and his colleagues were highly
skilled aviculturists whose birds were invariably in good health - and often
impeccable plumage - when they were landed after an often lengthy sea
voyage. It is not so many years ago that collectors working in countries,
such as New Guinea and certain South American locations, faced a variety
of hazards ranging from unpleasant tropical diseases to efforts by local
populations to evict them from their territory by a variety of means ranging
from fusillades of arrows to the close attentions of the local witch-doctor.
I spoke with Wilfred Frost on quite a few occasions in my zoo days and
some stories of incidents which had overtaken him while collecting in New
Guinea were quite blood-curdling. The man himself, although by then
elderly and somewhat frail, had an uncanny habit of what I can only describe
as materialising (as opposed to arriving) at the zoo soon after returning to
England from some far-flung outpost. We were always aware of his
impending return via cables which mainly provided brief details of what
he would have for sale. Birds of paradise were invariably high on the list,
but he also brought back a variety of other species including bowerbirds,
catbirds, honeyeaters and so on.
Although he travelled widely in Asia and Central Africa, Charles Cordier
was also something of a Central and South American specialist who provided
some of the USAs leading zoological collections with many avicultural
rarities including rare hummingbirds and tanagers, cock-of the-rocks,
quetzals, manakins, bell birds and umbrellabirds. Writing in th e Avicultural
Magazine in 1943, Jean Delacour refers to a collection Cordier brought
from Costa Rica to the New York Zoological Park as &amp;apos;...perhaps the finest
lot of birds he has ever secured'. Among them were three umbrellabirds,
18 quetzals and 54 hummingbirds, few of which, it was believed, had ever
been previously imported. Cordier was another past-master of the highly-
skilled art of delivering delicate wild-caught birds in excellent condition
and Delacour applauded his expertise with an observation about the quetzals:
'For the first time, I saw perfect specimens...tame and feeding well'
Such was Delacour's admiration for Cordier ? s abilities that the two of
them travelled to Indochina - one (Delacour) to obtain skins for taxonomic
purposes, the other to concentrate on live birds, which he did to some purpose
by amassing a collection of around 300 specimens. They included Long-
tailed Broadbill Psarisomus dalhousiae. Fulvous Pitta Pitta oatesi and
Elliot's Pitta P. ellioti.

Aside from the collectors, there were numerous individuals and
commercial organisations dealing in birds in the UK, particularly between
the wars. In London, Gamages store in Holborn had a thriving zoo
department which offered for sale a variety of species many of us would
like to get our hands on today. In 1933 their advertisement in the Avicultural
Magazine listed Giant Whydahs Euplectes progne , Virginian Cardinals
Cardinalis cardinalis, Nonpareil Buntings Passerina ciris , Scarlet and
Festive Tanagers Ramphocelus bresilius and Tangara cyanocephala,
hangnests Icterus spp., caciques Cacicus and Psarocolius spp. and Sulphury
Tyrants Pitangus sulphuratus.
H.E. Rogers owned an interesting enterprise on Merseyside - Liverpool
Zoological Park with an address off Lark Lane. For reasons which escape
me, this locality seemed to hold a particular attraction for bird keepers and
bird dealers and long after Rogers had fallen off his perch I purchased
quite a few exotics from at least two other dealers who had established
themselves in the area. Arrangements at the park appear to have been
somewhat vague, according to information gleaned years ago from people
who had known the place well. Apart from birds there was a variety of
larger, zoo-type exhibits (including mammals) which the locals, in exchange
for a modest admission charge, could inspect. Turn up with a well-stuffed
wallet, however, and you could take away your choice of exotic pet - anything
from a Binturong to a Buzzard.
Some of the prices provide a fascinating insight into the '30s animal
trade. At the bottom end of the scale you could purchase such as Bronze
Mannikins Lonchura cucullata and Green Singing Finches Serinus
mozambicus which were fairly expensive at what today would be around
25p (approx. US$0.40) per pair. There were also plenty of larger and more
interesting species on offer - pairs of Germain's Peacock Pheasants
Polyplectron germaini for less than a 'fiver' (approx. US$8.00), Red-faced
Lovebirds Agapornis pullaria #2.50 (approx. US$4.00), various toucans
Rhamphastos spp. #5 and #6 (US$8.00 and US$9.60) each. More expensive
were Andean Condors Vultur gryphus at #100 (approx. US$160) each.
Further afield in Belgium, Robert Henry was putting even more temptation
in the path of aviculturists with flamingos Phoenicopterus spp. #9.50
(approx. US$15.20) per pair, Argus Pheasants Argusianus argus #12.50
(approx. US$20.00) per pair, Squacco Herons Ardeola spp. #5.00 (approx.
US$8.00) per pair and African pelicans Pelecanus spp. #5.40 (approx.
US$8.64) each.
There were also some excellent book bargains to be had and in the
Jubilee Number of the Avicultural Magazine (May 1935), Frederick R.
Jones of Torquay offered five volumes of Gould's The Birds of Great Britain
'...with 367 beautiful hand-coloured plates, imperial folio, crimson half
morocco, gilt edges'. The price? A snip at #34 (approx. US$55)!

It is difficult to identify a precise time when the sun began to set on
what had been a truly golden era for aviculture. But Jean Delacour, expressed
forebodings in his account of 'The Progress of Aviculture During the Last
Three-quarters of a Century' which was published in the Avicultural
Magazine in November 1969.
He wrote: 'Today air transportation has changed the picture entirely.
Native trappers in remote parts of the world can despatch their catches
easily by aeroplane and the flights are so fast that even very delicate birds
can be left unattended until they reach their destination. Innumerable species
which had never before been seen outside of their native countries, many
beautiful and unusual hummingbirds, sunbirds, quetzals, tanagers, cock-
of-the-rocks, etc., are frequently exported in numbers - in fact they have
been captured far too much; the early losses have been tremendous by lack
of careful and knowledgeable handling, and restriction of such activities is
urgently needed. As a result of this new situation the great harbours and
bird shops of such as London, Liverpool, Marseilles, Le Havre, Antwerp,
Rotterdam, Hamburg and Genoa have been closed, and the new ones are
found in the vicinity of the main airports.'
'As circumstances have changed considerably, so have the bird
collections; very few large, private ones remain, while numerous new zoos,
large and small, and open to the public, have appeared - particularly in
England and in France. Several of these maintain very good bird collections.
Keen bird keepers and breeders, however, who maintain comparatively
small numbers of rare and difficult species, very well housed and cared for,
are even more numerous than they used to be, and they carry on with the
same skill and enthusiasm the work of their predecessors.'
'It is interesting to note that, as time passes, bird-keeping is gradually
becoming less difficult....Avicultural societies, of which there are only a
few in the world, ours being the most important, are probably more
prosperous today than at any previous time. This is mostly due, I believe, to
the greatly increasing interest of the public in general in natural beauty,
and birds stand at the top of the ladder. It seems to be one happy result of
a sad human situation; the artificial, cramped distressing conditions of life
of so many city people make them crave for trees, flowers and birds. It
contributes to the increase of our membership.'
I am sure many current members will identify with those views - even
to the point of regarding what Delacour wrote as prophetic. Aviculture,
not only in Britain but the rest of the world has undergone dramatic change
and in terms of species availability in Europe is enjoying a feast.
Will aviculture ever again experience a golden age? I doubt it. Can
English cricket look forward to a renaissance? Ask me again in 1999
when we have played consecutive series against the West Indies, South
Africa and Australia!

More effort needs to be put into their management and breeding in order to
form more sustainable populations. With the exception of the Bali Starling
which is now breeding well, more attention in particular needs to be paid
to the other JMSP (Joint Management of Species Programme) species to

THE SOCIETY'S VISIT TO BIRDLAND
by Stewart Pyper
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.969815296296296" page_id="56293998"  page_num="133" year="" vol="">
Following the Council Meeting of 12th April 1997 (reported on next
page) and lunch in a local pub, almost 50 members and their guests visited
Birdland. The original Birdland was created by the late Len Hill, who was
a staunch supporter of the Avicultural Society. After his death it closed
and reopened later at a new seven acres (approx, three hectares) site beside
the River Windrush in Bour ton on the Water. It is being built up gradually
and it looked as so some of the original aviaries have been re-erected. The
new owner is Eddie Twigg, Veronica Wilson is the Manager and David
Woodcock the Curator.
It was a warm, sunny, spring day. As in most collections nowadays
there was a large selection of parrots, which included Yellow-streaked Lories,
Hawk-headed Parrots and Queen of Bavaria Conures, Rothschild's Crackles
(Bali Starlings), Red-billed Blue Magpies, Spreo Starlings and Violaceous
Touracos were admired, as were Kookaburras and White-crested Laughing
Thrushes. As a result of the visit, Mike Curzon has loaned Rode7; Blue-
crowned Motmot to Birdland to make up a potential breeding pain
In a glass covered aviary, with dense vegetation, were single examples
of the Burmese Shrike, Lilac-breasted Roller, San Bias Jay, Imperial Pigeon
and Kookaburra, each in need of a mate. Rheas, flamingos and Black
Swans were admired, as were the large group of penguins, which included
several King Penguins.
The tropical house had a breeding colony of Gouldian Pinches in an
aviary by themselves. Other inhabitants of the tropical house included two
Emerald Starlings, a Red-tailed Laughing Thrush and a Red-billed Horn bill.
Other horn bills on view in outside aviaries included the Trumpeter and
Black species. Grey Peacock Pheasants always attract attention due to
their wonderful plumage and we also admired the Lemon-breasted Pigeons.

A Council Meeting was held on Saturday, 12th April 1997 at Bourton-
on-the-Water, Gloucestershire.
The following members were present: Miss R. Ezra (President), K. W.
Dolton, Prof. J. R. Hodges, C. J. S. Marler and R. C. J. Sawyer (Vice
Presidents), K. J. Lawrence (Chairman), M. Curzon, M. Ellis (Hon. Editor),
R. Grantham, R. E. Oxley, S. Pyper, P. J. Schofield, S. Tonge, J. T. Trollope
and Ms.R. Wiseman.
Stewart Pyper, the Membership Secretary, was pleased to report that
the recruitment drive has resulted in an increase in membership. The Editor
gave a cautiously optimistic report on his progress in planning the
forthcoming issues of the magazine, but was at pains to stress that progress
is very much reliant on members providing a steady flow of material suitable
for publication in the magazine. The Editor was granted permission (subject
to cost) to reproduce three colour plates to illustrate the article about the
White-fronted Bee-eater in the next magazine.
It was unanimously agreed by the Council, that the President, Miss
Ruth Ezra should write and thank Dr Quinque for his most generous
donation to the Society's funds.
It was decided that the President's Garden Party would be held on Sunday
22nd June, and that the Chairman would arrange the Autumn Social
Meeting.

A Council Meeting was held on Sunday, 14th September 1997 at Bristol
Zoological Gardens.
The following members were present: Miss R. Ezra (President), K. W.
Dolton and R. C. J. Sawyer (Vice Presidents), K. J. Lawrence (Chairman),
M. Ellis (Hon. Editor), R. Grantham, N. Hewston, R. E. Oxley, S. Pyper,
P. J. Schofield, G.R. Greed (Hon. Secretary /Treasurer).
The accounts for 1996 showed a small surplus, and it was agreed to
have colour plates in all four 1997 issues of the magazine. There were no
breeding awards to consider.
It was decided that the D.H.S. Risdon Award for the best article in the
magazine during 1996 should go to Anthony J. Mobbs for his article about
keeping and breeding Gouldian Finches (.Avicultural Magazine , 102, 3:99-
102). The Council discussed various articles and felt the Anthony Mobbs'
article contained a great deal of practical, concise information which formed
a sound basis for a person starting to keep Gouldian Finches.
The 1998 Social Meetings were discussed and the meeting concluded
with the Hon. Secretary /Treasurer inviting the Society to a special function
to be held at Bristol Zoo in June or July 1999.

The President's Garden Party was held on Sunday 22nd June, when
102 members and their guests journeyed to Cobham, Surrey, to view the
wonderful collection of birds kept by our President, Miss Ruth Ezra, and
Vice President, Raymond Sawyer. This private collection must rank as one
of the finest in the world. Whereas in May it had been feared that we were
heading for another summer drought, the garden looked very fresh due to
the recent rain. During our visit there were several showers, but these
lasted for only a few minutes.
Demoiselle and Crowned Cranes roamed free in the gardens, along
with 'Emma' the tame female Stanley Crane. In the aviaries in the front of
the house we saw Peruvian Thicknees, Spotted Dikkops, Pink-crested
Touracos, Emerald Doves, Island Thrushes and a female grosbeak. The
paddock aviaries housed Kookaburras, a Blue Whistling Thrush (at present
the two whistling thrushes cannot be paired-up because they fight), Satyr
Tragopans, Keas and an egret. Raymond has two baby Giant Tortoises,
which is believed to be a European first breeding, and it was interesting to
see several of the Giant Tortoises walking around the enclosure.
The 6 Jewel Cage' housed Gouldians and Painted Finches. In the lakeside
aviary we saw Giant Spotted Laughing Thrushes, Black-necked Stilts and
Scarlet Ibis, including a youngster bred last year which is still colouring-
up. Black phase Stella's Lories were feeding young. On the lake were
flamingos and a selection of waterfowl.
Most of the aviaries are at the rear of the house. All have heated
accommodation and are tastefully planted, making them both an
aviculturist's and an horticulturist's dream. Blue-faced Honeyeaters had a
youngster hand-reared by Sheila Becker, which at the time of our visit was
six weeks old, and the Masked Plovers were sitting again. We saw Choughs,
Azure-winged Magpies, a Magpie Tanager, Red-winged Laughing Thrushes
and Australian King Parrakeets. The five Carmine Bee-eaters are now
well established and some tunnels have been constructed in the hope of
encouraging them to nest, but so far these have been ignored.
The tropical house had a dazzling array of inmates. Among the birds I
saw were six Long-tailed Broadbills, a male Roulroul Partridge, Hooded

Pittas, Black-chinned Yuhinas, various zosterops, Golden Bush Chat, Violet-

approx, four days old. There were numerous Red-headed Tits, the white
race of the Long-tailed Tit, Bearded Reedlings, a Golden-headed Quetzal,
various flowerpeckers, dacnis, Purple and Yellow-winged Sugarbirds,
Greater and Rufous-bellied Niltavas, Paradise and Turquoise Tanagers,
another Hooded Pitta, Fairy Pitta and several young Roulroul Partridges.
There were also Brown Twinspots, Crimson Seedcrackers, Western Bluebills
and a pair of Rhodospingus Finches, as well as Golden Bush Robin, Blue-
winged Fruitsuckers, Scarlet-chested Sunbird and White-fronted Bee-eater.
A pair of Red-billed Oxpeckers in rough condition when they were purchased
only a short time before had improved so much that they had built a nest
and hopes were high that they would reproduce. This aviary has trellis
work attached to the wall at the rear so that these birds can cling onto it.
Two birds deserve a fuller description. The first of these being a Black
and Red Broadbill from south-east Asia. This species has a blue and yellow
bill and its plumage appeared to be more black than red, with a white area
on each wing. The broadbill stood out because it was new and most of us
had not seen this species before, it having appeared on dealers' lists only in
the past ten months or so. Like most broadbills it was not very active and
cannot be described as striking in appearance.
The second species is the Orange-breasted Bush Shrike, also known as
the Sulphur-breasted Bush Shrike, a very beautiful African species which
most visitors would not have seen before. The forehead is greenish yellow,
the crown and nape is bluish grey and the back and wings are olive to
greenish yellow, while the throat is bright yellow and the breast a rich
orange. It measures 19cm {IViin) and is about two-thirds the size of the
somewhat similar coloured Grey-headed Bush Shrike. There was a pair,
with the female being not quite as bright as the male. There is a good
illustration of this shrike in Mackworth-Praed and Grant and a full-page
illustration of it in Shrikes of Southern Africa by Harris and Arnott.
We saw Bartlett's Bleeding Heart Doves sitting and Green Wood Hoopoes
were also incubating eggs. New arrivals at Cobham included a pair of
Keel-billed Toucans, and there are now two pairs of Blue-bellied Rollers.
It was a delight to watch a pair of red Stella's Lories playing at the water's
edge. We also saw Emerald, Royal or Golden-breasted, Amethyst or Violet-
backed and Splendid Starlings, also Superb Spreos which have bred again
this year, various touracos and the old Toco Toucan. At the time of our
visit, Sheila Becker was hand-rearing two Eclectus Parrots only a few days
old. Due to the weather, a lovely tea was enjoyed by all, in various parts of
the house, where members and their guests were able to enjoy each other's
company and discuss various matters - not all of them avicultural. The
Society is most grateful to Ruth and Raymond for their kind generosity in
donating all the monies from the ticket sales, amounting to over #750, to
the Society's funds.

BOOK REVIEW
THE BIRDS OF AFRICA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991576864864865" page_id="56294002"  page_num="137" year="" vol="">
When I unpacked the review copy of The Birds of Africa, Volume V,
and saw that this enormous volume (which has 669 pages and weighs almost
81bs (just over 3kg)) is devoted almost entirely to warblers and flycatchers,
my first reaction was one of disappointment. I would have much preferred
to have been given the opportunity to review the earlier volume or volumes
covering the likes of the kingfishers, bee-eaters, rollers, hornbills, touracos
and parrots. It took me a while to appreciate that I now have in a single
volume all the warblers and flycatchers which occur in Africa, including
the European and other migrants. Most are either 'little brown jobs' or
'little grey jobs' which can be devilishly difficult to distinguish from one
another, so having what looks to be all of the species and many of the races
and plumages illustrated, and so much information about them in one
volume, is obviously a great advantage.
Because most of them lack bright colours, together with the fact that
many are highly insectivorous, means that on the infrequent occasions that
they become available, their appeal to aviculturists is limited mainly to a
few softbill specialists. One species, the Southern Tit Warbler, called in
this volume the Chestnut-vented Warbler, was bred recently in the UK by
Raymond Sawyer, who you will recall described the breeding in the previous
issue of the magazine. So far as I am aware the only other species which
has been bred here is the Silverbird (a flycatcher). It was bred here in
Cornwall by the late Mrs. Scamell, who imported her birds from Kenya.
Re-reading Mrs ScamelTs account of the breeding (Avicultural Magazine ,
79, 6:183-189), brought back wonderful memories of being with Tim and
Jane Barnley in Kenya and setting off on a Sunday morning, armed with
samosas and Marmite sandwiches and accompanied by their 'bird boys 5
for Kongelai down in the 'hot country 5 to catch the Silverbirds, including
the pair and their youngster which went to Mrs. Scamell. The Silverbird
proved popular because of its attractive coloration and the fact that it is not
too difficult to keep. Although, most softbill enthusiasts aspire to trying
their hand at keeping paradise flycatchers and wattle-eyes, they are so highly
insectivorous that it is questionable whether we should even attempt to
keep them. According to this volume, the wattle-eyes and batis or batises
are not flycatchers, but flycatcher-like or shrike-like birds, with no general
agreement as to precisely where they belong in the overall classification of
birds - Sibley and Monroe, apparently on the basis of DNA studies, place
them in the family Corvidae!

Volume V opens with the thrushes (including the rock thrushes and
ground thrushes, but not the robin chats and other closely allied species)
and I have found it interesting to be able to compare various races of the
Olive and African Thrushes alongside the Kurrichane Thrush on one plate.
I was surprised to find illustrations of the Fieldfare and Redwing in a book
about African birds, but then The Birds of Africa covers the entire continent
including North Africa, where both are winter visitors.
The last bird in Volume V is one which looks and sounds to be a most
fascinating species, one I had not been aware of prior to reviewing this
volume. It is called the White-tailed Shrike Lanioturdus torquatus and is
described as 'A semi-terrestrial insectivore, chat-like on the ground but
with strong plumage and behavioural resemblance to Batis. Thought to be
a malaconotine shrike by Harris and Arnott (1988).' Its eggs resemble
those of helmet-shrikes.
The Birds of Africa is published by Academic Press. The present volume
(ISBN 0-12-137305-3) is edited by Emil K. Urban, C. Hilary Fry and Stuart
Keith, the 32 colour plates (illustrating 676 birds of 312 species) are by
Martin Woodcock, the line drawings within the text (illustrating mostly

The 1997 UFAW Zoo Animal Welfare Award presented for a new or
modified zoo exhibit which is judged to provide improved conditions for
the welfare of captive animals and helps visitors to appreciate their physical
and behavioural needs, has been presented to Marwell Zoological Park for
its new Penguin World exhibit. The park's new home for its Jackass and
Macaroni Penguins Spheniscus demersus and Eudyptes chrysolophus
consists of a large, contoured and landscaped area and an hourglass-shaped
pool. It is large enough to allow the penguins to 'porpoise' and is deep and
has submerged rocks. A biological filtration system cleans and recirculates
the water into the pool across a pebble beach and via water jets. The land
area is extensive and has a range of different substrates on different levels,
secluded areas and nest tunnels. The public can observe the penguins from
a number of vantage points, including from an elevated viewing platform
and through viewing windows.

HATCHED UNDER BENGALESE

<bodyText confidence="0.98704456097561" page_id="56294006"  page_num="141" year="" vol="">
John Harvey, of Devizes, Wiltshire, keeps mainly small seedeaters
most of which are Estrildids, and recently succeeded in breeding a Yellow-
winged Pytilia Pytilia hyprogrammica , perhaps better known on dealers'
lists as the Red-faced Pytilia. The birds built in a nest basket and the
youngster was reared on a seed mixture, egg food and whatever insects the
parents could catch in the aviary which measures 6ft x 4ft x 6ft high (approx.
1.8m x 1.2m x 1.8m high) with a shelter.
John had for some time longed to breed the Blue-billed Mannikin
Lonchura bicolor. Over the years numerous nests were built and eggs laid,
some of which hatched, but no young were reared. So, a friend, Brian
Humphreys, of Trowbridge, offered to put the next clutch under a pair of
his Bengalese. These were housed in a breeding cage 2ft long x 18in x
18in (approx. 61cm long x 46cm x 46cm) with a nest-box, and of the four
eggs, three hatched and all three young fledged. Brian has found that
Bengalese like these which take mealworms make the best foster parents.
They run the mealworms through their beaks to extract the innards and
discard the skins which Brian says are too tough for small seedeaters. He
has found that Bengalese will generally learn how to do this by watching
each other. The birds also have E.M.P. softfood and this was also fed to the
young.
The three young mannikins closely resembled their parents except that
they were brownish black, rather than glossy black and, rather than white,
were yellowish, not unlike the colour that white surfaces become when
subjected to cigarette smoke over a long period, as happens in the smoking
room of a public house.
Brian keeps records of his birds so that he knows which pairs of
Bengalese are the best foster parents. Using Bengalese he has also bred
Red-billed Firefinches Lagonosticta senegala , Blue-capped Waxbills
Uraeginthus cyanocephala , Cordon-bleus U. bengalus , Purple Grenadiers
U. ianthinogaster and Red-winged PytiliasP. phoenicoptera (the following
year the pytilias reared their own young).
During 1997 Brian has bred 12 Cuban Finches Tiaris canora, all of
which were reared by their parents. They raised the first brood in a 6ft x
18in x 18in (approx. 1.83m x 46cm x 46cm) breeding cage, before being
transferred to a communal flight which they shared with other waxbills
and finches. The broods were of three, one, two, four and two young. Each
time the pair used the same nest basket, using coconut fibre, horse and
donkey hair to make the cup-shaped nest. The eggs were speckled with
reddish brown. Within a week of the young fledging, the female started to
lay again, and about two weeks after the young had left the nest, the parents
started to attack them. They were fed a foreign bird seed mixture.

A SUGGESTION FOR A NEW AWARD
by Philip Schofield
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99371255" page_id="56294008"  page_num="143" year="" vol="">
The Society's medal is awarded for the first captive breeding of a species
in Great Britain or Ireland. When instigated, the award served to encourage
aviculturists to breed birds. This was a novel idea - most birds were caught
in the wild, and accounts of 'first breedings' furnished much new data
about their habits. It did not matter if breeding stopped at the first medal-
winning generation; there were always plenty more in the wild.
At the close of the twentieth century, much has changed. There are,
quite simply, fewer species left to be bred 'for the first time'. Currently, the
medal is available only to a small proportion of our members; those who
cannot afford expensive 'new' species from the wild and those who live
abroad are debarred from the award.
Let us look at some documented achievements in aviculture, that have
made a lasting contribution to our pursuit. In the Avicultural Magazine for
November-December 1950, Norman Nicholson described his work with
the Red-headed Parrot Finch Erythrura psittacea. He bred these birds
through 18 generations, starting with wild birds imported in 1932, and
kept a stock going through the Second World War. The many Red-headed
Parrot Finches of today may include descendants of Mr Nicholson's birds.
As he said, '...it is a great achievement to win a coveted Inedal for a first
breeding, but the continuous successful breeding of a species brings its
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.894680111111111" page_id="56294008"  page_num="143" year="" vol="">
own particular reward'. To my mind this reward is threefold:
1. The successful breeder passes on the knowledge of 'how to do it',
enabling others to emulate his or her success.
2. They also pass on the birds that have been produced, to be enjoyed
by future generations as aviary subjects and, if necessary, to replenish
depleted wild populations.
3. Prospective bird breeders are inspired by the writings of those
already enjoying success. In this context, I have a favourite article among
my Avicultural Magazine back numbers (totalling about two-thirds of the
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.926237444444445" page_id="56294008"  page_num="143" year="" vol="">
run). This is 'My Birds in 1971', by Dr S. B. Kendall, in the January-
February 1972 issue. There he described breeding successes in a collection
restricted to five species. Most of us keep too many birds; I have over 30
species in a medium-sized town garden, and sometimes wish I had the self-
control needed to give six times the attention to a sixth of this number. Dr
Kendall had long term success with all five species, and many of their
descendants must still be about. I have carried on in a small way with the
Dwarf Turtle Doves Streptopelia tranquebarica that he cherished for 30
years.

The Gouldian Finch Chloehia gouldiae is now one of our most popular
domesticated species. This was not the case in 1932, when P.W. Teague
wrote in the May issue of the magazine. This nine-page article would form
an excellent introduction to anyone starting with this species today. Teague
played an important role in the Gouldian's metamorphosis from a difficult
imported subject to a more straightforward and established aviary bird. A
further article, illustrated by Peter Scott, appeared in 1950, celebrating 25
years of continuous Gouldian culture. Australian finch breeders of today
owe much to this pioneering enthusiasm.
In conclusion, I suggest that a new award should recognise 'services to
aviculture', by an individual who leaves the rest of us with what appear to
be three essentials for our hobby:

that too many decisions are taken 'behind closed doors'.
This is a matter which has been raised from time to time before. While
the Council is not against the idea of holding open meetings, the general
feeling is that as so many members live abroad or for other reasons would
be unable to attend such meetings, it would preclude the majority of members
from participating.
Therefore, I suggested that members who wish to express their views
on the way in which the Society is being run, should do so by means of
'Letters to the Editor', which can be published in the magazine (as they
were in the past). This will give the entire membership the opportunity to
join in any debate and express their views. It will also give those of us
running the Society the opportunity to answer any criticisms and explain
why certain things are done in the ways in which they are.
We also welcome your views on the magazine. Are you happy with
the content of it, or would you like to see changes made to the magazine,
and if so, what changes would you like to see?

Lagonosticta larvata vinacea
by Neville Brickell
The Vinaceous Firefinch is widespread but local (no where is it common),
occurring in tall grasslands with thorn bushes and among disused cultivation
often adjoining streams, while in Gambia, West Africa, it is also often
associated with bamboo thickets. Usually it is observed in pairs or small
parties, occasionally in the company of Blue Waxbills Umeginthus
angolensis and Red-billed Firefinches L. senegala. L. larvata vinacea
ranges from Senegal to southern Mali; L. /. nigricollis from eastern
Cameroon to the Central African Republic, northern Zaire, Uganda and
southern Ethiopia; L. /. togoensis from Ghana to northern and eastern
Nigeria and western Sudan; and L. /. larvata is found in southern Sudan
and western and central Ethiopia.
The distinctive markings of the male, with its black face mask and pale
pink underparts are unmistakable in the field. The female lacks the facial
adornment and has the crown, mantle and wing-coverts pale brownish grey,
and her underparts are paler than those of the male and she has pinkish
buff flanks. Juveniles have greyish brown upperparts and pale cinnamon-
buff underparts and lack white spots on the flanks.
This species feeds on a variety of seeding grass heads, millet and,
occasionally, insects and spiders. In captivity it will also accept small
grain millet, in addition to canary seed, crumbled egg, ant pupae, small
waxmoths, caterpillars and spiders (Nicoli, 1976), plus mound termites
(Pinchin pers. comm.).
Apparently no nest in the wild seems to have been described, yet Serle's
finding of the race I larvata nigricollis has been documented, following
his discovery of two nests, one in July and the other in August in northern
Nigeria (Serle, 1938). They were found to contain clutches of three and
four incubated eggs. One nest was constructed of withering grass and
lined with seed heads and a few feathers. The second nest was not described,
so one must presume it differed little from the first nest. This species of
firefinch is parasitized by a species of indigobird Vidua spp. 1

The Vinaceous Firefinch has been bred in Europe, but due to the fact
that females are virtually unobtainable in the USA (Buckley and Calvin,
1994), where consignments usually consist of over 95% males, in the
company of various other species of firefinch, bird breeders have resorted
to extreme measures such as hybridization. Cotterell (1964), who bred the
Vinaceous Firefinch in the UK, described the nest as being barrel-shaped
and constructed of grass stems and coconut fibres etc., lined with feathers,
and having a small side entrance. Nests are usually sited in clumps of
grass or heather or in small shrubs, and only rarely in artificial sites such
as nest-boxes and wicker baskets.
George Pinchin was first to breed the Vinaceous Firefinch in Africa.
His birds were housed in an aviary measuring 1m wide x 3m deep x 1.8m
high (approx. 3ft 3in x 9ft lOin x 5ft 11 in), with two-thirds of the top
covered with clear fibre glass sheeting. The only living foliage consisted
of a large Sacred Bamboo Nandina dome Stic a (indigenous to East Africa).
Beneath the enclosed shelter dried Khakiweed Tagetes minuta , a sub-
herbaceous, strongly aromatic summer annual, commonly referred to by
local birdkeepers as curry bush, was packed tightly into one comer which
was used as the nesting site.
The nest was built entirely of Tef Grass Eragrostis tef and then lined
with coir and a few feathers dropped by a pair of Cuban Finches Haris
canora, the only other occupants of the aviary. The clutch of three eggs
produced one male and two female young. Clutches of four, and sometimes
five eggs, with an incubation period of 11-12 days and a nestling period of
18-20 days have been recorded (Goodwin, 1982).

WATERFOWL MUTATIONS, HYBRIDS, PLUMAGE AND
THE COLOUR PURPLE
by Philip Schofield
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998739567567568" page_id="56294016"  page_num="147" year="" vol="">
Some 30 years ago, when I started to keep ducks, the only non-domestic
species with a well established colour variant was the Bahama Pintail Anas
baharnensis. Silver Bahamas are still widely kept today and since then
many other species have produced colour mutations which are now freely
available. A leading dealer's current price list has on offer mutations of
seven species. Some others, such as the blonde and silver variants of the
Egyptian Goose Alopochen aegyptiacus , would be kept more widely if they
belonged to benign and peace-loving species.
Little or nothing appears to have been written about colour inheritance
in ornamental waterfowl mutations. My own experience in this area is
limited to three species. A pair of silver Carolinas Aix sponsa were obtained
from someone who had repeatedly failed to rear the ducklings from them.
I therefore split the pair, putting each one to a visually normal mate,
expecting to produce all normals in the first generation. The silver female
and her normal mate fell victims to an enterprising Fox. However, the
silver drake and his normal duck gave me seven young the following year,
four normal males and three silver females. This led me to think that their
normal mother must have been 'split' for silver, carrying what I then believed
to be a recessive mutation. I was wrong. One of these normal drakes,
paired to an unrelated normal female the following year, produced silver
daugthers. This demonstrates that silver Carolinas are in fact sex-linked.
The 'split' male of a recessive mutation could not produce mutant daugthers
by a normal female. Reference to any table of sex-linked Budgerigar
Melopsittacus undulatus mutations will demonstrate how this works.
Sex linkage was again demonstrated in the silver form of the Mandarin
Duck A. galericulata. Here a normal male with a silver female produced
all visually normal ducklings. This result could have been expected from
either a recessive or a sex-linked mutation. However, when a young male
of this FI generation was paired back to his mother, silvers of both sexes
and normal males resulted. There were no normal females, leading me to
the conclusion the silver mutation is sex-linked in both Mandarin and
Carolina Ducks.
Moving on to the Red-crested Pochard Netta rufina, I expected the blonde
mutation in this species to be sex-linked, partly from its superficial
resemblance to the cinnamon variety of the European Greenfinch Carduelis
chloris. Two pairings, each of a blonde male to an unrelated normal female,
proved me wrong. Normals and blondes of both sexes appeared from each

pair. Had the blonde variety been sex-linked (given that female birds cannot
be 'split' for a sex-linked mutation), all young females would have been
blonde and all males visually normal. Therefore this is a straightforward
recessive mutation.
The production of hybrids is not to be encouraged. However, when
they occur accidentally, the results can be attractive. Purple is an unusual
colour in birds, but I have seen a bright iridescent purple on two duck
hybrids. The orange head of the Red-crested Pochard combines with the
green head of the Mallard A. platyrhynchos to produce a purple head with
a slight crest. A hybrid of this parentage, kept with surface feeding ducks,
was not seen to dive for food (all waterfowl dive when 'playing') until
some newly fledged Red-crested Pochard were introduced. Seeing their
diving activities, the hybrid immediately joined in, the latent abilities
inherited from one parent having been awakened. Both sexes of an
accidental mating of a male Ringed Teal Calonetta leucophrys with a female
Brazilian Teal Amazonetta brasiliensis showed a brilliant purple speculum.
This was the unexpected combination of the green 'wing-mirror' of the
Ringed Teal with the bronze one of the Brazilian Teal.
One expects a bird's plumage (in a 'natural', non-mutant form) to be
the same on both sides of its body. The black primary flight feathers of a
Lesser Snow Goose Anser caerulescens caerulescens should therefore be
the same in number on its right wing as on its left. When catching my
Lesser Snow Goose gander to clip his wing after the summer moult this
year, I was surprised to note seven black primaries in one wing, and nine in
the other. The rest were white. I have not handled other full-winged Lesser
Snow Geese to see if this asymmetry is a regular occurrence; my others are
pinioned so are of no help. On the subject of waterfowl plumage, I can tell
when a naturally incubated clutch of Mandarins is hatching. The drake,
who has been guarding his mate throughout the incubation period, moults
his first wing-fan (the orange modified tertiary feathers) on the day of
hatching and loses interest in his mate and offspring at this stage. I would
not suggest this is the invariable sequence of events, merely that it has
happened with every pair of Mandarins that I have allowed to incubate
their own eggs.
Philip Schofield, who is an Avicultural Society Council Member, started
keeping what he calls his 'back garden * collection of birds in 1967. He
specialises in Galliformes, waterfowl and seed-eating pigeons, and also
has Demoiselle Cranes and a few softbills.

THE PURPLE-BELLIED PARROT Triclaria malachitacea:
ITS NATURAL HISTORY AND AVICULTURE

One of the most distinctive of neotropical parrots, the Purple-bellied
Triclaria malachitacea is unique in appearance and behaviour. It is the
only member of its genus. An extremely beautiful bird, it has uniform rich
dark green plumage, apart from the blue underside of and blue tip to the
long, broad tail, and has large brown eyes. It is a sexually dimorphic
species, with adult males distinguishable by the large patch of violet on the
abdomen. The species is 12in (30cm) long of which the tail accounts for
approximately 5in (12cm). It weighs about 140g. This species is usually
called the Blue-bellied Parrot in ornithological literature.

Pair of Purple-bellied Parrots and their four young in the breeding

My association with this species spanned 27 years, with a break of ten
years between 1977 and 1987. Since leaving Palmitos Park in 1995 I no
longer have this parrot in my care - and it is one which I miss very much.
As it has always been rare in aviculture, I feel privileged to have kept it in
my own collection and to have looked after pairs at Loro Parque, Tenerife,

<bodyText confidence="0.971638219512195" page_id="56294019"  page_num="150" year="" vol="">
Distribution
The Purple-bellied Parrot is endemic to the Atlantic forest region of
south-eastern Brazil. It occurs in Bahia, Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, Rio
de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Parana, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul.
There are two records from Argentina (Collar, Crosby and Stattersfield,
1994).
Status and threats
It is considered to be endangered. The main threat is habitat loss;
trapping for trade is also suggested as a reason for decline (Bencke, 1996).
If so, the mortality rate must be extremely high because this species has
always been rare in aviculture. Legal export of Brazilian birds ceased
more than 30 years ago; nevertheless, this has not stopped the export of
certain other parrot species from the same region. It is difficult to believe
it would be locally popular as it cannot 'talk' and has a personality which
is totally different from the usual companion parrots in the region - Amazons
and macaws. Virtually all parrots endemic to Brazil's Atlantic forests are
threatened or endangered as a result of loss of habitat. Bencke states that
in Rio Grande do Sul illegal clearing of forests on a small scale, to provide
wood for curing tobacco and fuel for winter, is still very common. However,
as the forest fragments are small and easily accessible to trappers, the theft
of chicks from nests might become a more serious threat in the future.
Three nests found in Santa Cruz do Sul were all at a low elevation - 3m to
5m (approx. 10ft-17ft) above ground. This factor and the accessibility of
remnant forest patches results in higher rates of nest poaching than occurs
in larger forest areas.
Habitat
This is a true forest dweller. According to Collar, Crosby and
Stattersfield, it lives in the shade of moister valleys (300m-1,000m (approx.
984ft-3,280ft)) and ventures out seasonally to lower areas. They state: 'Its
rarity (apparent low density and/or patchy distribution) appears to be related
to this habitat preference, but also to overall habitat loss and to competition
with man (who destroys the plant in the process) for fruits of the palm
Euterpe edulis , a main food source (Collar et al., 1992).'
Pizo, Simao and Galetti (1995) studied six parrot species in the Atlantic
forests, including Triclaria. They observed only one of these species, the
Red-bellied Conure Pyrrhura frontalis, feeding on the fruits of E. edulis.
Bencke states that 'Several evidences clearly indicate that the fruits of
Euterpe edulis are not a particularly important food resource for Triclaria
in Rio Grande do Sul.' He relates that in the central-eastern part of this
state, the Purple-bellied Parrot is mostly associated with the humid broadleaf
forests along the escarpment, which are now severely fragmented. 'It is

presently restricted to the largest remnants of mature forest. Based on the
amount of suitable habitat available, the number of Triclaria inhabiting
the escarpment in the centre-east of the state was estimated at a maximum
of 10,000 individuals, a numerous and so far unprotected population.'
Bencke states that on the Serra Geral escarpment (eastern-central Rio
Grande do Sul) there is now a complex mosaic of agricultural areas and
small forest remnants which are connected to a varying degree. Triclaria
is now restricted to the largest remnants of mature forest, almost all of
which are confined to hilltops and steep mountain slopes. It uses secondary
woodlands and narrow strips of second growth between plantations.
Apparently it tolerates secondary woodland only if it is connected or close
to tracts of essentially mature forest. In July and August the Purple-bellied
Parrot moves to second growth stands to coincide with the maize harvest.
Maize is one of its main food items at this time. Unlike other parrots, it
lives primarily in the forest interior, where it often occupies the lower strata.
Note that the words 'moister' and 'humid' are included in descriptions
of its habitat. Most people who have not visited the Atlantic forest area of
Brazil may not be aware that this is a wet region which, unlike the more
northern regions of Brazil, is quite cool. I was very briefly in the area in
1988 (for one day!) and the heavy rain and cool climate reminded me of the
UK. It helped me to understand why, in captivity, the Purple-bellied Parrot
shows a marked dislike of strong sun and why, in the UK, it would sing
joyfully on cold, frosty mornings. It is not a species which seeks the sun.

According to Bencke, this parrot is normally found in pairs (45% of all
records where the number of birds could be estimated). However, up to
three pairs may gather at certain times (usually early morning). These
birds vocalise continually and frequently engage in agonistic contacts. The
individual pairs, however, remain segregated within the group and often
respond to each other with a variety of vocalisations.'

Food sources

<bodyText confidence="0.999875" page_id="56294020"  page_num="151" year="" vol="">
The seeds and pulp of several common native plants, especially those
of the families Euphorbiaceae and Myrtaceae, and cultivated maize, are
the main foods in central-eastern Rio Grande do Sul, according to Bencke's
study. Some of these are 'keystone food resources' for Triclaria because
they fruit, and are consumed, over extended periods. They are available in
large quantities during periods of low overall fruit diversity or constitute
the main food item during the breeding season. Purple-bellied Parrots
were not observed to feed on buds or nectar, possibly because they are
infrequent items of the diet, although these items are often listed in the
literature. They were seen to eat wood and bark.

Avicultural history
The first reference I can find to this species relates to a single bird kept
by a well-known member of the Avicultural Society, Hubert Astley, in 1906.
David Seth-Smith, Editor of the Avicultural Magazine for many years,
visited Hubert Astley and his wife Lady Sutton at Benham Park, Newbury.
His wonderful collection there included a pair of Lear's Macaws
Anodorhynchus leari. Mr Seth-Smith, who was Curator of Birds at London
Zoo, noted: '... perhaps the rarest bird in the whole of Mr Astley's fine
collection was a small Parrot from South America, which he calls the Violet-
bellied Parrot Triclaria cyanogaster. It is a bright green bird with a large
patch of violet blue on the abdomen and bright reddish-brown eyes. I have
never before seen or heard of an example of this species in captivity' (Seth-
Smith, 1907).
I can find no further reference to this species in aviculture in the first
half of the century, except for a single bird at Berlin Zoo. In 1961 an Essex
importer received a pair. In 1964 or 1965 Herbert Murray, also of Essex,
England, and a valued supporter of the Avicultural Society for many years,
imported five birds for his own large collection. I can vividly recall seeing
them in one of his huge aviaries. They were so unlike any other parrot
with which I was familiar! They hawked flies! I was very taken with their
beauty, especially their large dark eyes. When Mr Murray advertised a
pair in 1968 I was the only person to answer the advertisement! The pair
cost me #30 (approx. US$48) - probably the greatest avicultural bargain in
which I ever invested. They enchanted me.
Since that time I can literally count on the fingers of one hand the
number of collections in which I have seen this species outside Brazil -
Walsrode, Loro Parque, Palmitos Park and one private collection. The
Purple-bellied Parrot has a reputation for being very hard to establish when
newly imported. One dealer in Paraguay reputedly said he did not like to
handle this species because it always died.
Requirements in captivity
The aviary should be large enough to enjoy the skilful flight of this
species. Ideally it would be large and planted, or surrounded with trees. It
should provide good cover from strong sunlight; an enclosed shelter is
necessary in a temperate climate. The Purple-bellied Parrot is actually a
hardy species which tolerates well low temperatures. As already mentioned,
it has an intense dislike of strong sunlight. It needs a frequent source of
fresh branches for gnawing. Without this, some birds may suffer from an
overgrown beak.

Diet
Loss of recently captured birds was probably attributable to their
reluctance to sample the foods which trappers would offer. Mr Murray's
birds thrived because they were placed in a large planted aviary. Every
week they were provided with saplings 8ft (2.4m) long, which had been cut
especially for them. They fed on the bark and leaves in 'a frantic manner'.
They took fruit only if it was hung from a perch. When I first had my pair,
I would attach grapes to a branch. They also took nectar with added
vitamins, spray millet, sunflower, peanuts, pine nuts, niger and canary
seed. Various fruits, berries and com on the cob were relished eventually.
The male's most favoured items, in order of preference, were cherries, pips
from grapes, buds or bark from trees, and spray millet. At Palmitos Park
the Purple-bellied Parrots would eat a wide variety of fruits, including guavas
and cactus fruits. The usual greenfoods, and raw vegetables such as carrot
and courgettes, were also eaten. The basic mixture contained seeds and
cooked maize and cooked beans, but I do not recall them being very fond of
the latter. Fresh corn was a favourite item. I never saw them hawking
insects - but this behaviour would be possible only in a very large aviary. I
especially remember their fondness for guavas and was interested to read
the list of plant species which parrots at Parque Estadual Intervales in
south-eastern Brazil had been observed to eat (Pizo, Simao and Galetti,
1995). The only item listed for Triclaria was the seed of the guava Psidium
guajava.

One of the most wonderful and certainly the least parrot-like
characteristic of this parrot, is its song. According to Dr Moojen (1960),
the Indian name of this species, Sabia-cica means a kind of thrush, or
robin, on account of its 'melodious, soft thrush-like song'. He further
states that 'Blue-bellied Parrots easily learn to sing new songs or to imitate
the human voice, like most parrots'. While I am not surprised that they
could be taught to whistle new tunes, they appear to me to have no propensity
at all to imitate the human voice.
In my long out-of-print The Parrots of South America (1972) I recorded
of my male: 'His song is clear and thrush-like and consists of a few notes
repeated quite loudly. He can also whistle very quietly.' This quiet whistle
is comparable to the sub-song of a Blackbird Turdus merula, for example.
Females may also whistle quietly - but I have heard the full song only from
a male.
In addition to the melodious notes, Purple-bellied Parrots have a 'chack-
chack' alarm call. The courtship display of the male, in which he opens
his wings, and lowers his body, includes a series of notes which might be
interpreted as 'chit-chit-chit-chit-choowit'.

Behaviour

<bodyText confidence="0.99236" page_id="56294023"  page_num="154" year="" vol="">
This is perhaps closest to that of the Red-capped Parrot Pionopsitta
pileata or other members of this genus; pileata is the only one with which
I am familiar. However, in flight it is nothing like the heavy-bodied
Pionopsitta. Triclaria shows extreme manoeuvrability. I recorded of my
male: 'He is unafraid, rather than tame, and will display when I talk to
him. He fans his tail, ruffles his short head feathers, dilates the pupils of
his large brown eyes and walks with deliberate tread along the perch, bowing
low until his beak almost touches the perch. When he reaches the end of
the branch he flies off and returns immediately to repeat the performance.'
(Low, 1972).

Males can be very excitable and a little aggressive when displaying.
The tail is spread and the wings may be opened and the violet feathers of
the abdomen are puffed out. But it is the eye blazing and the rapid head
shaking which indicate most clearly the male's excitement. He may also
rub his beak on the perch. A responsive female will also shake her head
and sing quietly. So different from an Amazon, for example.

A female hand-reared by the author at Loro Parque - it is aged 32 days
Breeding
This species does not seem difficult to please regarding nest-boxes. The
female at Palmitos Park would lay in April or May. The nest-box was not
large - approximately 8in (20cm) square and 12in (31cm) high, as I recall.
There were two pairs when I was at Loro Parque. In 1988 one female laid
her first egg on the 7th January and the other female laid on the 20th
January. These females laid four eggs, whereas the female at Palmitos
Park always laid six eggs! Eggs were laid on alternate days. Incubation
probably did not commence until the second egg was laid. The first egg
would usually hatch 30 days after it was laid and the other eggs after about

28 days. The last egg in a clutch of six can hatch as long as 34 days after
it has been laid, presumably because incubation is more erratic after most
of the chicks have hatched. However, the true incubation period under
optimum conditions is much less - as short as 25 days in one egg which
was placed in an incubator.

Six chicks - from 11 days to newly hatched - in one nest at Palmitos Park
Chick growth
Newly hatched chicks have long off-white down on the back, a little on
the nape and virtually none on the head. The beak is almost unpigmented,
with a very faint brown tinge. They weigh about 6g. After a few days the
protrusions at the side of the upper mandible (they cannot be described as
pads) are quite pronounced. The light grey and mid-grey second down
erupts at about two weeks. The ears open at about 12 days but the eyes do
not open until about 18 days. The wings and the head are the first areas to
feather. Chicks were ringed with 6.5mm rings at about 14 days. At about
three weeks the feathers are just starting to erupt. The area over the crop
and the neck is the last to feather. The highest weight I recorded in parent
reared young was 156g at 32 days, which was about lOg more than average.
After the age of about five weeks chicks were not weighed as they disliked

being handled. The feet start to darken at about one week old and are dark
grey on fledging. The young spend eight weeks in the nest.
Several young had to be removed for hand-rearing, in order to be treated
for bacterial infections. They were eating well on their own by seven weeks
and were independent at about nine weeks old, when they weighed between
120g and 148g.
Immature plumage
Newly fledged young resemble females. They cannot be sexed by the
colour of the abdomen. However, if a few feathers are plucked from this
area, the replacements feathers should indicate their sex. The main feature
in which immature birds differ from adults is in the colour of the narrow
area of bare skin surrounding the eyes, which is white, whereas in adults it
is grey.
General remarks
The Purple-bellied is not a typical parrot. It has a grace and, in flight,
manoeuvrability more reminiscent of a softbill. Neotropical parrots, as a
group, show homogeneity - they are remarkably similar in many aspects
(whereas, Australian parrots, for example, are not). The Purple-bellied
Parrot might be described as the odd one out. It is a most attractive aviary
bird, with its beautiful dark green plumage and unique and pleasing
vocalisations. Its lack of a pronounced area of bare skin around the eyes
and the large size of the eyes are other features which set it apart from most
neotropical parrots. It seems destined always to be rare in aviculture; its
avicultural future seems uncertain due to the very small numbers in Europe
- and perhaps none elsewhere outside Brazil.
With continuing loss of habitat, its status in the wild can only deteriorate.
Because it is such a distinctive species, more effort should be made to try to
secure its survival - in its natural habitat and in aviculture. Bencke (1996)
described public awareness activities which have been targeted at the urban
section of the community in Santa Cruz do Sul and Lajeado. These included
a newspaper article and a television programme. A short video was produced
documenting the plight of this parrot in the region. Bencke himself met
with state politicians to explain alternative solutions to the use of wood
from native forests in the curing of tobacco leaves. He pointed out that first
world importers of tobacco leaves originating from the Santa Cruz do Sul
region should be made aware that the tobacco is planted in areas where a
globally threatened parrot species occurs.

SOME EXAMPLES OF THE USE OF FOSTER PARENTS
AT LORO PARQUE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99776052631579" page_id="56294028"  page_num="159" year="" vol="">
by Roger G. Sweeney
The 1996 breeding season at Loro Parque was particularly successful,
both in the total number of birds reared and in the diversity of taxon which
reproduced. While our main objective is to have as many as possible of our
breeding birds rear their own chicks, with such a large number of birds
being reared each year, it is unavoidable that a proportion of these will
require artificial neonatal care, if they are to survive. The most frequently
used approach in such cases is to hand-rear the chicks, which we do with
great success.
An alternative solution often available to us is the fostering of eggs or
chicks from unreliable parents, with a different pair of birds which have a
proven record as good parents and which, for any one of a number of reasons,
are incubating eggs which are infertile or are of far less importance than
the eggs which are in need of reliable foster parents. In recent years we
have had cause to use foster parents on several occasions and the results
have been very good.
With some species which are kept communally, or when several pairs
are maintained in the collection, it can be a simple solution to foster eggs
from an unreliable pair of parrots, to a different pair of the same species.
This should be done only when the foster parents have no viable eggs of
their own, otherwise if eggs are given to a pair which have fertile eggs of
their own, problems can arise later when trying to establish the true
parentage of the chicks. The Greater Vasa Parrot Coracopsis vasa is one
species where we have some pairs which either break their eggs or are
unreliable in incubating them, by contrast other pairs are excellent parents.
We have been fortunate for the past two years in that two spare females
(which are housed together) have laid and incubated eggs consistently. In
1995 and in 1996 we gave these two females fertile eggs from other Vasa
Parrots which are unreliable parents and so far the two have a perfect record
in rearing chicks from eggs that they have fostered.
When birds of the same species are not available as foster parents, then
fostering with birds of the same genus, or of a very closely related genus,
can produce good results. For several years at Loro Parque it has been
common practice to foster rare Amazona species with common species of
Amazona, which has always been done with a very high level of success.
In 1996 13 Red-browed Amazon Amazona rhodocorytha chicks were reared
by foster parents. The chicks were shared between six different sets of
foster parents, two pairs of Green-cheeked Amazon A. viridigenalis, a pair

of Blue-fronted Amazon A. aestiva, a pair of Yellow-fronted Amazon A.
ochrocephala, a pair of Blue-headed Pionus Pionus menstruus and a pair
of Maximilian's Pionus P. maximiliani.
A good example of the fostering of chicks between closely related genera
is that of the Hyacinth Macaw Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus which is now
being reared with increasing success at Loro Parque. In 1996 nine chicks
were reared. One of the reasons why the breeding of this species had not
been successful in previous years is that only one of our breeding pairs can
be considered to be reliable parents, other pairs frequently demonstrate
poor incubation, with eggs being damaged or not incubated. In such cases
we continue to look at the husbandry of these pairs to see if we can improve
their nest site provision and surroundings and to see if we can increase the
chances of them rearing their own chicks. At the same time we looked this
year to ensure that an early clutch of eggs from each of these pairs were
removed and given to foster parents. Two pairs of Green-winged Macaws
Ara chloroptera were chosen as the foster parents and in both cases the
eggs hatched and the resulting chicks were cared for perfectly. Hand-rearing
of Hyacinth Macaws is still practised at Loro Parque on occasions when we
lack other alternatives, but our preference is for parent rearing or foster
rearing. Another good example of fostering between different genera was
undertaken in 1994, when a Homed Parrakeet Eunymphicus cornutus was
reared by a pair of Golden-mantled Rosellas Platycercus eximius, made
necessary because our exhibition pair have consistently lost within the first
day of life,the chicks that they have hatched. The chick grew and fledged
without problems under the care of the rosellas. This again demonstrates
the flexibility of good foster parents if they are well managed and carefully
observed.
While closely related species are normally the best option when potential
foster parents are being sought, some consideration of the comparative
physical size, if such a difference exists between the species concerned, is
an obvious fact that has to be taken into account. When looking at the
possibilities for fostering eggs of the Golden Conure Guaruba guarouba,
we considered several different pairs of closely related conures of the genus
Aratinga. The decision was finally based on balancing the benefits of
choosing the largest species of Aratinga which was breeding at the time,
against relying upon the experience of the pair of Aratinga with the best
record of proven parenthood. We decided to opt for experience and a pair
of Sun Conures Aratinga solstitialis with a prolific breeding record were
our choice. The Sun Conure is closely related to the Golden Conure, having
a similar physical appearance, feeding response, incubation time and chick
growth rate. Our one concern was that the larger size of the Golden Conure
chicks might mean they would prove too large a workload for the foster

parents. While Sun Conures can easily rear three or four chicks of their
own, three growing Golden Conure chicks might prove too great a burden.
On this occasion the foster parents carried out their task very successfully,
with our only concern being the weaning period in the first week after the
chicks had fledged. This was an exceptional case and normally we would
not have left all of the chicks with the foster parents as the chicks increased
in body weight, but would have removed either one or two to ease their
task.
A much more unusual example of the flexibility in the use of foster
parents was the use of a pair of Derbyan Parrakeets Psittacula derbiana to
successfully incubate Gang-gang Cockatoo Callocephalonfimbriatum eggs,
and then rear the resulting two chicks for the first two weeks of their lives,
until the chicks were removed to the nursery once they had reached a large
size. This was a particularly memorable case of using foster parents, bearing
in mind the obvious differences between the genera Psittacula and
Callocephalon , but as long as the chicks are removed after the first two
weeks, such differences are not an obstacle.

Three Golden Conure chicks with Sun Conure foster parent
In summary, foster parenthood is an extremely useful husbandry method
if the following points are given careful consideration when selecting the
pair of birds to act as foster parents:

history of bacterial or fungal infections. Chlamydia, protozoa, or intestinal
parasitic infestations, and should obviously be free of any virus.
3. Size - As already mentioned when describing the rearing of the
three Golden Conure chicks by a pair of Sun Conures, size differences
between the parents of chicks being fostered is not necessarily a prohibiting
factor. However, careful thought should be given if a significant size
difference is involved and careful observation of the chicks' development
will be required to make sure that as the chicks grow and increase their
body weight and food intake, that this does not become a task with which
the foster parents cannot cope.
4. Appearance and behaviour - In my experience, the appearance of
the chick is not a critical factor, so long as eggs are transferred beneath the
foster parents and not a partially developed chick. I know of several
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.992854272727273" page_id="56294031"  page_num="162" year="" vol="">
instances in which chicks of a quite different physical appearance have
been reared by foster parents. A more significant consideration is the
behaviour of the chick and foster parents, particularly in the feeding
response. Most psittacines have fairly uniform chick food-solicitation
behaviour, but what can vary is the force with which the feeding action is
undertaken. Some species (such as Aratinga conures) with a forceful feeding
action may injure chicks of a more delicate species which they are trying to
rear.
If these four main points are taken into account, then foster parenthood
is a useful and interesting avicultural husbandry technique which can have
a high level of success.

by James Summers
By the 8th June 1996, the preliminary nesting duties had all gone very
well, the female was walled-in the nest-box and the male was feeding her
while she was inside. Then began the guessing or the search to find the
person with the best hearing, to try to hear if there were young in the nest-
box. By the noise and the amount of food being taken on the 13th July
1996, it was presumed that there was at least one youngster alive and well
inside. To satisfy this extra need the number of feeds were increased from
three to four a day. The diet consisted of fresh fruit - apples, bananas,
grapes, papayas, pears, peaches, nectarines, tomatoes and berries when
they were available. They also received mealworms, locusts, an insectivorous
mixture and SA37 (a vitamin and mineral supplement). The grapes and
locusts were always the first foods to be taken. In time, pinkies, pups and
then adult mice were added to the diet.
Being unsure of the number of days Wrinkled Hornbills spend in the
nest-box, we were anxious but not unduly worried about the length of time
that they had spent in the nest due to the fact that, hopefully, the young (be
there one or two) would be bigger and more fully feathered, when they
eventually emerged.
The day arrived when the female released herself from her incarceration
inside the nest-box. She was very clean and looked in excellent condition,
as did one of the two young. We found out about the second youngster
when we inspected the nest-box as soon as the female emerged. The second
youngster, 'F.T.', as it became known, was only partially feathered on the
head, wings and tail. Except for a few pin-feathers, the body was mostly
bald, with the skin a very dark purple (almost black) and there was what
seemed to be an air sac on the back, which if touched, would rise and fall.
It was decided to remove it from the nest-box, for two main reasons:-

sex was determined later). Also, his belly was huge and looked
almost abnormal, and when he was standing, it rested between
his feet.
He weighed approx. 675g. He was put in a plastic water tank which
measured 36in x 18in x 24in (91.5cm x 46cm x 61cm). A blanket was
placed over the top, as it was thought that for a while, the darker it was
inside, the better it would be. He would not feed on the first day, but we

thought there was no cause for concern as he looked so healthy, even though
he was bald. The second morning he started to take food, albeit hesitantly,
and was given the same diet as the adults, but with extra pinkies. By the
end of day two (28th September 1996) he was feeding well.
He got to know me very quickly, but in anyone else's presence was very
wary and stopped feeding and just watched them. For the first few days, he
fed six or seven times a day and was very vocal when feeding, and luckily I
had no trouble from neighbours being woken by him. During the day 'F.T.'
was kept in a warm room in which there were everyday noises and apart
from a little shuffling about in the box, he seemed quite settled. I did find, to
my cost, that at the merest hint of light getting into the box, he would defecate
through the opening. When I was at home during the evenings and on my
days off etc., I left the radio playing as he seemed to settle a lot easier with a
little noise in the background. The only noises he made were sighs and
twitters, which were I thought, almost sounds of contentment.

At first he was not weighed routinely, but as from 3rd October 1996, he
was weighed each day and, as from the 7th October, each feed was also
weighed and at the end of the day the total weight of the food was recorded,
as can be seen on the accompanying graph. As the days went by all seemed
to be going well, his weight gain was good, as was his feather growth, with
new pin feathers coming through and his belly was not so large, and he
was beginning to become alert and very aware of what happened around
him. I tried giving him a stuffed sock for company, but it was used as a

toilet. His weight gain remained generally good, but with a few peaks and
troughs, which were perhaps to be expected. However, I was unprepared
for what started to happen on the 16th October 1996, when his weight
began to drop. It had reached the 1kg mark, but overnight fell by 15g,
which was not drastic at first, but by the 25th October, his weight was
down to 962g. I recorded in my daily diary: The way that 'FT.' behaves I
feel sure his weight loss must be normal, for he is bright and his feather
growth is excellent. However, in spite of this in the back of my mind I
cannot help feeling that maybe something is wrong!
The author with 'F.T.'
Even at approx. 15 weeks old he was picking up droppings and fruit
and practising his 'walling' (or plastering) technique. Another strange
thing was his ability to regurgitate apple. Being a fussy feeder and knowing
that more interesting foods such as banana and grapes, his favourites would
follow, he would eat a little of the apple, then the rest of the food, but when
he was finished, he could somehow distinguish the apple from perhaps
lOOg of food, and regurgitate it. By this time I was leaving a bowl of food
with him, but his weight continued to drop. However, he looked healthy
and had good breast muscle growth. I was now trying to feed him only
three times a day. As from the 30th October, he remained at the park and
I made no more trips home with him. By the 4th November, he was eating
very well, his feather growth was almost complete and getting plenty of
flying practise was the top order of the day. The 11 th November his weight
had gone back up to 850g, having at the beginning of November fallen to
774g. The rate at which he had put weight back on was quite extraordinary.
I know that during weaning birds can lose weight, but nothing had prepared
me for what happened. The 11th November was the last time that 'F.T.'
was weighed, as he had begun to get a little too stroppy to continue, besides
which I thought that to continue would not be to his benefit.

Thanks to the hard work of the keepers at Paultons Park, I am proud to
say that 'F.T.' is now very happily paired with a Wrinkled Hornbill from
Chester Zoo and the two are living at Rode Tropical Bird Gardens, Somerset,
under the watchful eye of Mike Curzon, who keeps me up to date with the
male's progress.
There follows a diary recording the hand-rearing of the young Wrinkled
Hornbill, which was removed from the nest Friday, 26th September 1996,
when it weighed approx. 675g.
786g 29/9. He seems fine.
822g 1/10. He is fine. He has a big air-filled sac on his back.
832g 3/10. He fed well all day until his last feed. His droppings are
watery, perhaps because he has eaten too many grapes. He is
breathing heavily and his wings are drooped slightly.
840g 4/10. 'F.T.' looks good today, he has perked up since last night and
is very restless at times. The skin on his back has gone down and
there is no sign of the air sac.
5&amp;6/10. I have no scales at home, so am unable to weigh him,
however, he is eating well and is very vocal. I would like to leave
the top of the tank open, but he screams when I go near.
830g 7/10. Although he has lost a little weight, there has been a lot of
feather growth. Today I started weighing his food.
830g 8/10. He is the same weight as yesterday. I tried giving him a little
food, then leaving him for a couple of minutes, then going back and
giving him a little more. The 7.30am feed is always the smallest -
he is obviously not a morning bird! At 2.00pm he took 166g in one
feed.
904g 9/10. His feather growth is excellent. He is very bright and likes to
see what is going on around him. The note of his scream changes
when he has had enough food. He has eaten a lot today and was not
interested in his last feed at 10.00pm.
890g 10/10. He has lost 14g, which is not bad and is nothing to worry
about. On 8/9/10 l,308g was taken, including lots of pinkies on the
9th. There is regurgitated apple on the bottom of the tank.
890g 11/10. Twenty-four hours have passed without him gaining any
weight. However, his feather growth is excellent, his head feathers
are a distinct brown and white, he has two lines of black breast
feathers and his tail is white. His eyes are still very blue and his
legs and feet are grey. He continues to bring up apple when he is
full.
944g 17/10. I am not sure about the accuracy of the scales!
940g 17/10. I tested the scales and found them to be correct to within 4g-

5g. He is getting very vocal and starting flying exercises.
944g 14/10. His growth seems to be levelling off a bit. I expect it to be
Tuesday or Wednesday before there is any further growth. Today he
ate his first whole mouse and, I think, he enjoyed it. There are a lot
of light coloured pin feathers on his neck and he is preening very
well.
990g 15/10. He is eating well, but is fussy, he has to have apple and pear
first or he will not take the food. His eye lashes are very long, his
face is blue and the skin on his back is almost mauve. He is practising
flying and his legs and feet are strong and he has started to perch.
He was not interested in the 10.00pm feed.
101 Og 16/10. He passed the 1kg mark today. His feeding is slow now and
he was not keen to eat at 8.00pm and 10.00pm.
994g 17/10. He lost weight overnight, having taken only 500g of food
yesterday. He is very fussy and not interested, so his feeds may be
cut to 8.00am, 1.00pm, 5.00pm and 9.00pm.
986g 18/10. He is still losing weight. He is not keen on feeding and is
almost having to be force fed. I prefer to give him just a little rather
than force feed him. Later he took 114g of food at 8.00pm and
when I tried again at 10.30pm; he took 112g. He is also taking food
out of his bowl.
1025g 19/10. I was kept awake part of the night by his squeaking and
whimpering. His weight has risen by 39g - surely his weight changes
are too erratic! There is always a bowl of food left in his box and he
takes a little food out of it. Over the past 12 days his average daily
food intake has been 580g. He is very inquisitive.
980g 20/10. He has lost 45g since yesterday. Why does this happen?
The first thing this morning he would not eat, but I put a bowl of
food in with him and he is eating from it as I write this. He eventually
took 98g by himself.
990g 21/10. He is very slow to feed, but bright and alert - is his weight
levelling off? His feather growth is excellent at present.
990g 22/10. Yesterday his food intake was the lowest recorded. If offered
food he was not interested, but if it was put at the back of his gape,
he took it. At 9.00pm though he took 158g of food.
997g 23/10. He has lost a little weight. Perhaps I worry unduly, for
despite his erratic feeding behaviour, he looks very well.
972g 24/10. He is feeding okay today. All his wing feathers are fully
grown and he is exercising well. This evening he spent 15 minutes
sitting on my arm watching Star Trek on TV, so obviously he has
dodgy taste like me.
962g 25/10. The way that 4 F.T.' behaves makes me feel that these weight

fluctuations must be normal, for he looks very well, he has good
feather growth and is very alert and active. His droppings are as
only a hornbill's droppings can be. He uses them to practise his
walling technique -1 looked in to see him picking up droppings and
a small piece of fruit and placing them on the side of the box, and
then tapping them into place.
960g 26/10. The pin feathers on his neck, back and underparts are opening
out and he now has a perch which he uses very well.
948g 27/10. He is still losing weight, but feels plump. When I was feeding
him today, it seemed to me that he tried to show when he had eaten
enough, by turning his back to me and putting his head in the corner
of the box. Of the 102g of apple taken during the 8.00pm feed, 22g
were regurgitated. How does he do it?

920g 28/10. A weight loss of 28g. He has lost weight on all but one of

out of the box, rather than in it. The perch will have to be raised,
because his tail is getting mucky.

not, he is eating well. I am spraying him now to get him preening,
because his plumage is looking dry and mucky.

longer, as he gets very agitated and I cannot keep him still long
enough to get an accurate reading.

is a male, but I expect I will be proved wrong.
820g 9/11. His weight continues to increase. He eats all alone now and
has done really well during the last couple of days.
836g 10/11. He is very well, vocal, and becoming stroppy.
850g 11/11. Weighed him for the last time. The sad thing today is that
his nest mate died. It was attacked by the parents and never
recovered. In the future we will have to make sure that the young
are removed earlier.

What IFAR has achieved - what it still aims to achieve
by Brian Byles
Whether as individuals, whether we are connected with organisations
that cater for the numerous branches of aviculture, or have an interest in
wild birds, most of us are aware of problems which birdkeepers and
ornithologists encounter. These problems need to be solved if we are to be
successful and to make progress in what for some is a business but, for
most, is a rewarding hobby. Avian management techniques need to be
improved, a better understanding of nutrition is vital and, probably most of
all, we all want to know how to deal more efficiently with avian health
problems.
It is for these reasons that the International Fund for Avian Research
(IFAR) was established. Administered by Professor John Cooper FRCVS
(Chairman), Dr Francis Scullion MRCVS (Scientific Adviser) and myself,
the former Editor of the magazine Cage &amp; Aviary Birds (Secretary), the
aim of IFAR is to provide grants to people who are undertaking avian
research of various kinds.
Mauritius Pink Pigeon Columba mayeri
Thanks to generous donations from individuals and interested
companies, IFAR has been able to help important projects. During 1997 it
gave #750 (approx. US$1,200) to a group of specialist veterinarians and
biologists - Andrew Greenwood, Mike Peirce and Kirsty Swinnerton - who
are carrying out a study into Leucocytozoon infection in the Mauritius Pink
Pigeon. The group had already established that the infection causes
significant mortality in both wild and captive individuals, particularly
juveniles of the species on Mauritius. The grant covered the cost of
examining blood smears from Pink Pigeons and potential reservoir hosts
by Dr Mike Peirce to establish the overall and seasonal prevalence of the
parasite.
Others who have been supported by IFAR - and its predecessor - Cage
&amp; Aviary Birds Avian Research Fund * include: Philip McGowan BSc,
who undertook field studies into tropical pheasants threatened with
extinction; Neil Forbes FRCVS, working with Dr Hawkey at London Zoo,
undertook research into detecting avian tuberculosis by haematological
examination; and Mark Pilgrim, based at Liverpool's John Moores
University, looked into the taxonomic status of Amazona autumnalis.

regarding the premature death of Budgerigars Melopsittacus undulatus ;
and the University of California at Davis. The last named received a grant
to build and equip aviaries for parrots being used as part of a research
project.
Money has also been given to Dr Peter Robertson, Lowland Gamebird
Unit, Game Conservancy, to take part in a five year joint study of pheasant
ecology in China, and Philip Boydell MRCVS, of the Animal Medical
Centre, Chorlton, Manchester, has been assessing the prevalence of ocular
lesions in captive birds of prey in the UK. Over 5,000 birds have been
examined. The results demonstrate that there is a high prevalence of ocular
damage in rescued wild birds and a significant incidence of ocular disease
in captive and working birds. A number of species appear to have a potential
for certain conditions, possibly as a result of indiscriminate breeding.
Bernard Okech, of the Department of Zoology, University of Nairobi,
has been given a grant to survey the blood parasites of free-living and
captive non-domesticated birds in Kenya. The study is being conducted in
collaboration with the Ornithological Department, National Museum of
Kenya. Another veterinarian to receive help from IFAR is Dr Edith Singine,
based in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. She is undertaking research into
comparative morphology of blood cells of free-range chickens and flamingos.

Megabacteria
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998854470588235" page_id="56294040"  page_num="171" year="" vol="">
Megabacteria has become an avian problem in many parts of the world
in recent years, but thanks to the work of Tom Pennycott, Senior Veterinary
Investigation Officer, at SAC Veterinary Services Avian Health Unit,
Auchincruive, Scotland - and a grant from IFAR - captive birds in many
parts of the world could enjoy much better health.
First described in Canaries in Holland, megabacteriosis has been
diagnosed in a number of species including Budgerigars, grass parrakeets
Neophema spp. and lovebirds Agapornis spp. Dr John Baker, while working
for the Budgerigar Society in 1966, suggested that the condition was
introduced to exhibition Budgerigars in the early 1980s, rapidly spreading
as a result of widespread movement of birds kept by breeders.
The clinical signs of birds with megabacteriosis, according to Tom
Pennycott, are not dramatic and fairly non-specific. Birds are seen to be
'soft' with a hunched appearance and fluffed-out feathers. Changes in
droppings may be apparent, from a slight looseness to severe diarrhoea.
Birds often appear to be feeding, but closer observation shows that they are
grinding a lot of seed instead of eating it.

<bodyText confidence="0.97751404" page_id="56294041"  page_num="172" year="" vol="">
Megabacteriosis, Mr Pennycott reports, is usually confirmed by post
mortem examination. The birds are thin, with wasting of the breast muscles.
The feathers around the head may be covered in dried regurgitated material
and the feathers around the vent often stained with faeces. Changes are
found in the glandular and muscular stomachs of the birds, which is where
the megabacteria can be found. The lining of the glandular stomach becomes
rough, raised and discoloured. Megabacteria can be readily found at post
mortem examination when scrapings from the glandular stomach are
examined under a microscope. These organisms are very large - ten to 20
times the length of the bacterium E. coli. However, although megabacteria
are instantly recognisable, their true identity remains unknown and efforts
to culture the organisms have given ambiguous results.
It is even unclear whether megabacteria have actually caused damage
to a stomach, seen during post mortem, or whether they are organisms
found in normal birds, but which have multiplied to an excessive extent.
Tom Pennycott suggests that observations in an infected aviary indicate
that, after reaching a peak of mortality, losses then decline to a low level,
possibly after the development of some degree of immunity. Post mortem
examinations of Zebra Finches Taeniopygia guttata and Budgerigars have
revealed that megabacteria can be detected in young, unweaned birds,
suggesting one route by which infection spreads within an aviary. The
effective treatment, Mr Pennycott suggests, is unclear. Amphotericin B at
lg per litre of drinking water is said to be effective, but when used at a
lower dose in a small number of birds was unsuccessful, as was enroflozacin
(Baytril 10% Oral Solution) at 5ml per litre of drinking water.

IFAR has been expanding its activities. In addition to awarding grants
to suitable research projects concerning both captive and free-living birds,
it has introduced two new ways of providing assistance. In future, IFAR
will consider the loan, or donation, of equipment which is necessary to
complete various projects that will help those concerned with avian
problems. In addition, professional and/or technical help - which could
include visits to the project, by an expert in the field under study - will be
made available.
This is an exciting new venture,' says IFAR Chairman, Professor
Cooper. 'It should prove of practical value to aviculturists, field
ornithologists and veterinarians.' Already one of two incubators donated
by Gary Robbins, of AB Incubators, of Stowmarket, has been sent on loan
to Mauritius where it is helping to maximise the number of young Pink
Pigeons being raised in captivity by Kirsty Swinnerton and the resident
team. A further top-of-the-range incubator is available on loan to a suitable
research project.
A network of specialists is being established. Those involved will be
experts in specific fields who are willing to give advice on behalf of IFAR.
In some cases they may travel in order to provide that advice.
IFAR Needs your sponsorship
The success or failure of important research projects could depend upon
your support. IFAR receives numerous requests for assistance - both
financial and material - but the extent to which it can help is dependent
upon IFAR, in turn, receiving financial backing, equipment and/or product
from those with an interest in the well-being of both captive-bred and wild
species.
IFAR is looking for new sponsors. Current backers include John E.

BREEDING THE LESSER FLAMINGO Phoeniconaias minor

Introduction
The Lesser Flamingo Phoeniconaias minor is the smallest of the six
kinds of flamingo. It is the most numerous in the wild, probably
outnumbering the populations of all the other five forms added together. It
is fairly widely kept in captivity but seems more reluctant to breed than the
larger flamingos for reasons which are not entirely clear, but may be linked
to Lesser Flamingos being less hardy, or to their much larger colonies in
the wild. This article describes the successful nesting of Lesser Flamingos
in a private collection in Germany in 1992, which is believed to be the first
breeding of this species in Europe, and summarises more recent successes
in other German collections. The species is believed to have bred at least
occasionally at zoos in the USA and several times eggs have been laid at
the Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust, Slimbridge, UK.
The colony
Four juvenile Lesser Flamingos were obtained in April 1986. By 1992
there were 33 birds (18.15) in the group. Also in the enclosure were 2.3
Chilean Flamingos Phoenicopterus chilensis a variety of ducks and some
Red-breasted Geese Branta ruficollis. The ducks and geese initially caused
no problems for the flamingos, except for Canvasbacks Aythya valisineria
damaging nests by digging at the base, but the geese eventually proved to
be aggressive so the flamingos now share the enclosure only with small
ducks. Most of the flamingos are full-winged, which seems to make mating
easier for the males. A pinioned male Chilean Flamingo obtained late in
1992 to make the flock up to 3.3 has failed to mate successfully, while a
full-winged male has fertilised two females. A pinioned female Lesser
Flamingo however, which came from Tanzania in 1960, laid in 1995 and
is still in excellent condition.
Housing
The birds are kept in an enclosure of approximately 800sq m (approx.
8,600sq ft), with a pond measuring about 20sq m (just under 215sq ft) and
50cm (approx. 1ft lOin) deep which is allowed to overflow to cover another
lOsq m (approx. 108sq ft) in the breeding season. Part of the pen is planted
with conifers. The birds stay in this enclosure all year round and have a
lined house which is 80% transparent and which they use readily.
Food includes Mazuri Waterfowl Maintenance, Waterfowl Breeder and
Flamingo (E), Kasper Faunafood Seaduck Diet and Floating Duck Diet,

also shrimps and sometimes algae meal. Finely grated carrot is occasionally
added to the food. In the early years the Lesser Flamingos were given calf
milk which they took readily, but after two years they stopped taking it so
now the food is mixed with water. All the food is soaked overnight in two
buckets which are half-filled with food then filled to the top with water and
fed at 4.00pm the next day. The morning feed is one bucket of dry food
scattered on the water.
Breeding
In mid-May 1991 it was noticed that one of the female flamingos was
dirty on the back. A few days later, while turning the earth on the nest site,
a pair was seen mating only 3m (about 10ft) away. Following this other
copulations were observed by various pairs.
On 30th May at 9.10pm the first egg was seen on a nest mound. The
female was one of the first four birds and therefore just over five years old.
The egg weighed 106g and measured 86 x 55mm. The egg was incubated
by both parents alternately. On 3rd June a second female laid, this egg
measured 86 x 54mm and weighed 1 lOg. This female was paired to another
female and did not seem interested in the males. Neither egg was fertile.
Cold, wet weather around 10th June caused interruption and eventual
abandonment of incubation. Other females which were heavy did not lay,
and no longer looked heavy. Copulations ceased after 15th June. Early on
the 26th, with the temperature at 26*C (68*F) and humidity at 90%, a
group of males was again nest building. Males were seen mating with
each other and single-sex male and female pairs were seen associating. No
female pairs were seen mating, though they were tightly bonded. One
female was seen attempting to mount another but no mating took place.
Apparently homosexual males have been seen to chase and mount lesbian
females.
In 1992 copulations were observed from the beginning of May. Around
the 17th there was complete calm, with no mating or nest building. It was
very hot, over 32*C (89.6*F). The birds seemed uneasy. At the end of the
week the nest area, which had been dry, was flooded and nest building
began again immediately. The following week mating also recommenced
and the birds became more active.
On 30th May an egg was laid by the female which had laid on the same
date the previous year. This egg died at about ten days. A new pair laid on
6th June and on the 7th the female which was paired to the one which laid
on 3rd June 1991 also laid. The other female from this pair did not lay.
This egg was found off the nest the next morning and was replaced. A
single Chilean female tried to incubate it but it was knocked off again and
she broke it trying to retrieve it. This was a pity as the Lesser had mated

often with a male and it would have been interesting to see whether the two
females would have reared a chick. On 8th June this female was again
mated but did not re-lay, though re-laying has been recorded in flamingos
when an egg is lost. After 20th June all went quiet until 5th July when
pairing recommenced, and one male was again chasing the female which
laid on 7th June.
On 6th August one female was found dead on the water. She weighed
1,965g and was found on post mortem examination to have a fully developed
egg yolk inside and a large active follicle on the ovary. Death was caused
by a heart attack, probably stress-induced.
The egg laid on 6th June was on a nest under a tall cypress and close to
a fence. It pipped on 2nd July; the chick could be heard and its beak was
visible. It hatched the next day. It was possible to photograph the whole
process as it was very hot and the female stood on the nest and watched as
the chick hatched. After 24 hours the chick tried to stand. It ate the
remaining pieces of eggshell and was fed by the parents. On the 4th both
parents oiled themselves extensively; the preen glands were clearly visible.
They oiled themselves thoroughly in order to transfer oil to the chick.
On 7th July at four days old the chick was jumping around on the nest
mound like a goat kid. It left the nest several times for short periods, but
went back to the nest straight away. The next day the chick could stand on
one leg to preen. It fell over when flapping its wings as if trying to fly, but
righted itself immediately. It made longer excursions from the nest and
was accompanied by both parents. It was also followed and pushed around
by single females, including the Chilean. The whole flock gathered behind
the chick. The parents carefully guided the chick back to the nest. Because
of the attacks by the other birds the chick had to go through water and mud
to get back to the nest, and was shivering, so was brooded by its father on
the nest. It was often brooded during the day by both parents but
predominantly by the male, with the mother on the nest at night.
Later this day the pair with the chick were separated from the other
birds as they all wanted to take over the chick, despite having pecked at it
earlier. A pair of Chileans had attacked the parents on the nest and they
had not been able to defend themselves. The chick sought out a new nest
mound to roost on and was brooded by its mother.
On 10th July, at eight days old, the chick was seen to bathe for the first
time, albeit in a small puddle. It shook and preened itself just like the
adults. The chick took the lead in again finding a new mound to roost on,
and was brooded by the male during the day and the female at night.
The chick took food (Waterfowl Maintenance) from the water for the
first time at ten days old. At around 9.30pm it had already been sitting on
the new mound for some time and was ready to roost. It called to its

asleep on the same mound without its mother. At 7.00am the parents fed it
and it also took some food from the water. At 8.00pm it was back on the
new mound and after a lot of 'cheeping' its mother came over and sat
down, brooding the chick under one wing.
The next evening the chick sat on the nest at 8.45pm and waited for its
mother, who brooded it as on the previous night. At 15 days old it stood on
one leg on the nest to sleep. It had not been brooded by its mother for two
days.
On 21st July, at 19 days old, the chick was ringed with a 19mm ring.
This was removed later as it was obviously too big. A 14mm ring is a
better size for this species, and 16mm for Chileans. The chick and its
parents were let out of their temporary enclosure as all the other birds
seemed used to the chick by now. It was fed in the evening by its mother
and then fed with its father at the bowl. It was much more often with its
father than with its mother, and the male still protected it if it was harassed
by other birds. In the evening the pair and chick were put back into the

At 23 days old the bill was starting to grow curved and was turning
pale mauve. At 32 days the chick was about 50cm ( 19 3 Ain) tall, and had
therefore grown at an average of over 15mm per day. This very rapid
growth may be to enable chicks to walk long distances at an early age. At
Etosha Pan in Namibia chicks have been recorded walking 80km (approx.
50ml) to water as the pan dries out.
On 13th August the young flamingo, which had been named 'Philip',
was seen to bathe energetically for the first time, demonstrating his now
powerful and well-grown wings. The quills of the flight feathers were
visible. On the 14th he was six weeks old and his back reached his mother's
breastbone. He had to bend his neck to be fed, otherwise she could no
longer feed him easily. The down on his crown had been replaced by grey
feathers. On 18th August 'Philip' was feeding on flamingo food from the
bowl with his father, who watched over him, keeping at a distance three
other flamingos which were trying to feed.

In 1993 and 1994 the Lesser Flamingos failed to lay. In 1995 three
eggs were laid, but only one was fertile. The parents did not incubate it, so
the egg was hatched, and the chick reared, by another pair. Both the young
birds are males. The legs change from grey to red at three years old. Factors
involved in stimulating breeding appear to include freedom from
disturbance, warmth, sunlight and damp, marshy ground. At temperatures
above 20*C (68* F) the birds start to build on prepared nest sites whenever
the ground is made moist by rain, overflow from the pond, or soaking with
a hosepipe. Most of the birds build nests, including some single males and
single-sex pairs of both sexes. However, they dislike rainy weather, and if
it rains for more than two days at a time, pairing, mating and nest building
stop completely. In 1996 and again this year the Lesser Flamingos failed
to lay.
Chilean Flamingos laid infertile eggs in 1994, and in 1995 two fertile
eggs were laid by females paired to different males but both fertilised by
the same (full-winged) male. These both hatched but the chicks died at 11
and 31 days. In 1996 three pairs produced six eggs, and three young (2.1)
were reared, all three from one male and two females. This year four eggs
had been laid by the end of July, two were infertile, in one the embryo died,
and another from the same pair was also fertile. Eggs are collected and put
into an incubator until just before hatching, when they are put back into
nests for hatching and rearing.
In 1993 Lesser Flamingos also bred at the Friedrichsfeld Zoo in Berlin.
A flock of 23 birds produced 16 eggs, from which two chicks were reared.
A private breeder in Schleswig-Holstein, who keeps large groups of four
kinds of flamingos, has had remarkable success breeding Lesser Flamingos.
His group of c.50 birds live in a house c.200 sq m (approx. 2,150sq ft)
made from double-glazed panels with a sliding roof which can be opened.
In 1992 one infertile egg was laid, in 1993 a large number of eggs resulted
in eight young, there were no eggs in 1994, four young in 1995, one in
1996, and this year 13 young from 14 or 15 eggs. The level of success
achieved in this sheltered situation seems to confirm that weather is an
important factor in breeding Lesser Flamingos in northern Europe.
Roman Alraun breeds waterfowl and flamingos at Neustadt, Germany.
His notes were translated and adapted for publication by Nigel Hewston,
who was formerly flamingo coordinator for the Federation of Zoological
Gardens of Great Britain and Ireland.

THE SOCIETY'S VISITS TO RODE AND BRISTOL ZOO
by Stewart Pyper

<bodyText confidence="0.961801548387097" page_id="56294051"  page_num="182" year="" vol="">
On Saturday 13th September a small group of members visited the
Tropical Bird Gardens, Rode and were shown around on what was a lovely,
warm day by Mike Curzon, a director. Mike has promised to write about
the breedings and other noteworthy happenings there during 1997, so I
will confine myself here to mentioning the new enclosure for ground
hornbills and the fact that members saw both Edwards' and Desmarest's
Fig Parrots. Rode is the only public collection in the UK exhibiting both
these species.
The following day almost 30 members and their guests visited Bristol
Zoo at the kind invitation of the Director, Geoffrey Greed, who is also the
Hon. Secretary/Treasurer of this Society. At present the zoo is undergoing
a major reconstruction programme. Regrettably it is behind schedule and
as a result the striking new exhibit which will house a collection of Philippine
birds was not yet ready. The aviary will feature a walk-through section
which should be popular with both aviculturists and the general public.
The old tropical house will provide heated indoor accommodation for the
birds. (When this aviary is opened a detailed report about it will appear in
the magazine.) A new lake for the colony of flamingos will replace the
aviaries opened some years ago by our President. A special feature at
Bristol Zoo is the large aviary with running water and plenty else to occupy
the group of at least ten Keas. The European Studbook for this species is
held at Bristol Zoo. Among other birds we saw were Yellow-throated
Laughing Thrushes, Azure-winged Magpies, Rothschild's Grackles or Bali
Starlings, Toco Toucans, Black-winged Stilts, Kookaburras and various
pigeons and doves, including the Nicobar Pigeon and the chestnut-naped
race of the Green Imperial Pigeon.
Behind the scenes we were shown a selection of young reptiles, including
a number of young Woodland Crocodiles hatched at the zoo. As on our
previous visits to Bristol Zoo, we enjoyed an excellent lunch which was
arranged by Geoffrey Greed and our thanks go to him and his staff for
making it such an enjoyable day.

BOOK REVIEW
AUSTRALIAN FINCHES - a colourful guide
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.967989060606061" page_id="56294052"  page_num="183" year="" vol="">
Arguably Australia's leading authority on its native finches in aviculture,
Russell Kingston is known worldwide for his expertise. His first book, The
Complete Manual for the Keeping and Breeding of Finches (1994), a tome
of nearly 500 pages, is the standard work on the subject. His most recent
book is in Australian Birdkeeper's A Guide to... series and covers Australian
Grassfinches .
More than 70 pages are packed with information and colour. In his
introduction the author gives some reasons for the popularity of these birds:
&quot;their quiet songs do not disrupt sensitive neighbours. They add colour to
the garden or indoor conservatory, are always lively and may be housed
together in a mixed collection in a planted aviary, or equally, they may be
kept in relatively small cages.'
Although written primarily for the Australian market, most of the
information is equally applicable in Europe. Some of the seeds mentioned
are unknown here, however. The notes on management and nutrition are
followed by the section entitled Australian Grassfinches in Profile. Every
species is covered under a series of headings such as Natural Breeding
Season, Breeding Ages, Courtship, Nest Description, Roosting Nest,
Number of Eggs, Incubation and Colour Mutations. It is concise but very
informative. A distribution map for each species is included.
The photographs are not merely decorative but highly practical in many
cases. For example, plumage differences or crown shape in male and female
are shown for Chestnut-breasted Munias, Diamond Firetails, Bicheno
Finches, Masked Grassfinches, Painted Firetails and others. Visual
differences are illustrated with diagrams for some species. This is an
especially useful feature of the book. Various mutations are also included,
such as the lutino Blue-faced Parrot Finch and the white Masked Grassfinch.
The average number of colour illustrations per page is about three, so this
book should be popular, as well as useful.
This guide is available price #13.95 plus 75p postage each from The
Bookshop, Southern Aviaries, Tinkers Lane, Hadlow Down, Uckfield, East
Sussex TN22 4EU. Tel:01825 830283 &amp; 830930/Fax:01825 830241. It is
also available from other avicultural booksellers.

Sir,
I greatly enjoyed reading the article 'Twenty-five years at CobhanT by
Raymond Sawyer in issue No 2 for 1997. I am sure the article was much
appreciated by members, especially those who know the collection.
I would like to comment on the photograph captioned 'Red Lory Eos
bornea ' which accompanied the article, The identity of this bird will perhaps
never be established with certainty - but it is not bornea. As it is such an
interesting bird, excellently photographed by Thomas Brosset, it would be
a pity to let the caption pass unremarked. A rather lengthy explanation is
necessary. Perhaps it is best to quote from my Encyclopedia of the Lory to
be published by Hancock House in 1998. There is a long preamble before
the bird is mentioned, however, which hopefully makes it clear that nobody
has yet been able to define convincingly either Eos s. squamata or E. s.
riciniata.
'Violet-necked Lory ( Eos squamata ) Note: the small size and variable
markings (except in obiensis) characterise this species. It has given rise to
much confusion over the years. For example, Salvadori (1891) listed three
species - wallacei , insularis and riciniata , all of which are now considered
synonymous with squamata (which was lacking from his catalogue). But
what exactly is the nominate race? No one seems able to answer this
question. I believe that the species is still evolving, with much plumage
variation within each population. The sub-species obiensis is distinctive
and easily recognised. But how does one distinguish squamata from
riciniatal According to Hubers (1996b), who examined a number of museum
skins, in the nominate race the crown is red, the collar is violet-blue and
can be complete, absent, wide or narrow; the shoulder feathers [scapulars]
are black-blue. In riciniata there is a wide violet-blue collar with variable
grey shading. In most birds the collar extends to the middle of the head
[crown]. The shoulders are red, Forshaw (1989) is uncharacteristically
vague, remarking on the variable plumage coloration and the violet-blue
collar around the neck which is 'broad and well-developed in some birds
but almost entirely lacking in others'. He describes riciniata as having a
'prominent violet-grey neck collar, usually extending up to hindcrown;
some birds have violet-gray crown but red nape'.'
'In his descriptions there are only two features which are different: the
nominate race has a violet-blue collar and dull purple scapulars tipped
with black and riciniata has a violet-grey collar and red scapulars.
Unfortunately, not all birds fit neatly into one category or the other; some
have only a few dark feathers on the scapulars. In a species which exhibits
such variable coloration, is there justification for separating these two races?

I suspect there could be a good case for naming two species: obiensis from
the island of Obi and squamata (it was named first) from all the other
islands within the range. However, here I follow current nomenclature
and consider them as sub-species of squamata .'
'It is worth noting that Wallace's Lory {Eos wallacei, Finsch (1864)),
from the islands of Wiageu, Gebe, Batanta and a small island near Misool,
is figured in Mivart (1896). It was said to differ from riciniata in that the
purple of the collar did not extend up the nape to the head - but then Mivart
admitted that this character was not constant. It seems that nobody has
been able to define the sub-species.'
'Descriptions Eos squamata riciniata is red on the head with violet-
blue or violet-grey on lower cheeks and, in some birds, also on nape and
crown; underparts violet-blue or violet-grey broken by a red band on the
lower breast. Scapulars purple or red, greater wing coverts and flight
feathers red, margined and tipped with black; tail purple-red above,
brownish-red below; under tail coverts purple or blue. The beak is orange,
the cere and skin surrounding the eye white or pale grey, feet grey and iris
orange-red or yellow.'
'Length: 26cm (10in).'
'Weight: 110g.'
'Immatures are variably marked; the red of the underparts is mottled
with dull blue or almost absent and there may be bluish markings on the
ear coverts. There are more black feathers, than red, on the wings, in some
immature birds. The beak and iris are brownish.'
'Further confusion is created by the existence of a form which lacks red
on the head or breast and has only a narrow line of dark blue on the neck;
it has the abdomen dark blue but differs from obiensis in having the upper
part of the wings almost clear red, and in its larger size. In Thomas Arndt's
Lexicon of Parrots, volume 1, what appears to be an immature bird of this
form is depicted on page 6, captioned as Eos squamata squamata . Perhaps
this is the nominate race. If so, it is either extremely rare or inhabits an
island from which birds are very rarely collected. In 20 years I have seen
only one bird of this form, an adult with very clear red plumage, which was
in the collection of Raymond Sawyer of Surrey in the mid-1970s .'

In spite of having moved many of its birds to new accommodation as
part of its redevelopment plan, and coping with the vagaries of the British
summer, Paignton Zoo reported an excellent 1997 breeding season. Among
its most notable successes was the breeding of an Australian Cassowary
Casuarius casuarius in the new woodland enclosure. In the Brook Side
Aviary, Little Egrets Egretta garzetta bred for the first time and a young
pair of Bali Starlings Leucopsar rothschildi raised four young from two
broods. Chilean Flamingos Phoenicopterus chilensis in their first year on
the new lagoon raised three chicks, despite the attention of the predatory
local Herring Gulls Lams argentatus. The Abyssinian Ground Hornbills
Bucorvus abyssinicus at last succeeded in rearing one of their own chicks,
after all the previous chicks had to be hand-reared by Jo Gregson. Other
species which bred successfully included Jackass Penguins Spheniscus
demersus. Snowy Owls Nyctea scandiaca, Sarus Cranes Grus antigone
and Crested Quail Doves Geotrygon versicolor.

Paradise Park, Hayle, had what was described as a reasonable breeding
season for a collection of its size and type. Among the parrots bred there
were Hyacinth Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus, Buffon's Ara ambigua,
Military A. militaris, Illiger's A. maracana and Hahn's Macaws A. nobilis,
Keas Nestor notahilis, Leadbeater's Cacatua leadbeateri, Triton C. galerita
triton, Lesser Sulphur-crested C. sulphurea and Roseate Cockatoos Eolophus
roseicapillus . The Hyacinth Macaw chick, which was hand-reared, was
bom with a crooked bill which required corrective surgery by vet Andrew
Greenwood. Two trios of Red-faced Lovebirds Agapornis pullaris excavated
nests in blocks of cork and each laid two clutches, but this was as far as
they got. Cranes did well, with Wattled Bugeranus carunculatus, Stanley
Anthropoides paradisea , Sarus Grus antigone and Crowned Cranes
Balearica regulorum all producing young. Village Weavers Ploceus
cucullatus, Yellow-fronted Woodpeckers Melanerpes flavifrons and Hoopoes
Upupa epops were also successful and keeper Dale Jackson hand-reared a
Chough Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax, which is a small step forward in the

More details have emerged about the kiwi chick hatched at Taronga
Zoo, Sydney, Australia, the first to be hatched there for 26 years. It is a
North Island Brown Kiwi Apteryx australis and was hand-reared by Bird
Division keeper, Chris Hibbard, appropriately enough a New Zealander.
He changed the breeding pair's diet and this is thought to have been an
important factor in the successful hatching and rearing. The new diet
consists of tofu (a soya product), ox heart, frozen peas and corn, diced
banana, sultanas, wheat germ flakes, yeast flakes and a special kiwi vitamin
supplement.
During the first four weeks, the chick lived a diurnal existence, but by
the time it was four to six weeks old its 'noctural clock' seemed to be
activated and it began to shun the daylight. Each morning though there

Passerine and Pigeon &amp; Dove Symposium
- a joint initiative by the EEP TAGs and ABWAK
19th &amp; 20th May 1998
at Bristol Zoo
There are many species of pigeons and passerines in captivity throughout
Europe, many of which are listed on the IUCN Red Lists. Captive breeding
programmes exist for a number of species such as the Bleeding Heart Pigeons
and the Bali Starling - of which there are reportedly only 14 left in the wild.
Attention to these species has produced viable captive breeding programmes,
but sustainable captive breeding of other species such as the Yellow-throated
Laughing Thrush and Crowned Pigeons is yet to be achieved.
This two day symposium will cover a wide range of issues, including
husbandry developments, captive breeding programmes, veterinary aspects and
fieldwork.
