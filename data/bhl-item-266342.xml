The Sun-Bittern is the sole member of the family Eurypygidae, in the
der Gruiformes. There are three subspecies: EM. major, E. h. meridion-
is, and E. h. helias. It is a non-migratory bird, ranging from southern
exico to Bolivia. It inhabits forested areas wherever streams, rivers and
arshes are present. In the wild, they feed on insects, crustaceans and
olluscs.
Sun-Bitterns measure approximately 45cm in length. The sexes are very
milar in coloration. The top and sides of the head are a steel grey except
&amp;gt;r a white stripe above and below the eye. The white throat area graduates
3 wn the neck and breast into a finely barred, fulvous and black plumage,
he iris is red with a black pupil appearing to be horizontal rather than
mnd.
Nesting and courtship in the wild
The nest is made on a tree branch anywhere from 2-6m high. The
iaterials used are wet mud, grass and moss. The nest is built up into a
ip-shape with a depression in the middle for the two to three eggs that
lake a clutch. The eggs are a cream colour with brown spots on the large
id of the egg and measure approximately 42mm x 33mm. Incubation is
etween 19-22 days. Courtship and nesting usually occur from January to
[ay.
History of Sun-Bit terns at San Diego Zoo
The first Sun-Bitterns were received at San Diego Zoo in 1939 with
ttle available history. Later acquisitions were three birds in 1952, two in
960, two in 1965 and two in 1969. More recently the Zoo acquired a
tale in 1983 from the Cincinnati Zoo. His captive hatching date is listed
5 1965 which makes him 24 years old now. From 1983 to 1986 this male

lived in a flight aviary with other neo-tropical birds, but without a mat&lt;
On morning rounds he could be seen in the food pan busily making a ne:
of dried leaves, mud and grasses that he had dragged into this preferre
site.
In 1986 the Zoo received a captive-bred, two-year old female Sui
Bittern from the Houston Zoo. The pair was moved to an aviary measurin
3.5m x 4m x 5m. It was densely planted with ferns, bamboo, bromeliati
and vines to afford the necessary privacy when nesting. Other bin
exhibited in the same enclosure are:

<bodyText confidence="0.983080041666667" page_id="58074861"  page_num="2" year="" vol="">
The daily diet for the Sun-Bitterns is comprised of chopped newbor
mice, Zupreem, soaked trout chow, mealworms, crickets, whitebait fisl
grated carrots and Super-preen vitamins. There was also a 'Soft-food pai
for the other species. It included chopped apple, banana, papaya, grape
figs, Zupreem, finch seed, soaked trout chow, mealworms, choppe
spinach and Super-preen vitamins. These food pans were fed to the birds c
a daily basis; however, in the breeding season the contents were increased.
Breeding
Twelve days after the male and female had been united in their ne'
aviary, the pair had started a mud nest. This was built on a branch ju:
outside the nest basket that had been provided. Thirty-four days later, tf
nest was completed with tendrils of moss hanging down the sides. Thei
was, however, one detail the pair had overlooked: the surface was flat.
On 15th August, courtship was observed in the form of gentle swayir
with the whole body. There were also vocalisations heard which sounde
like low, gutteral calls and a rapid clicking of the beak. These vocalisatior
were emitted by both the male and female. On 31st August 1986, the pa
laid their first egg. Both birds assumed incubation duties. Two days late
the egg was found shattered below the nest.
Later that same day, it was decided that the Sun-Bittern nest neede
some outside help. Layer upon layer of mud was added to buildup the rii
of the nest (approximately 65mm of mud). The keeper returned to th
aviary 30 minutes later to continue observations and found that tf
artificial rim had been removed by the pair.

On 23rd September another egg was laid and three days later it
isappeared. On 13th October (43 days after the first egg had been laid)
he third egg of the year was laid. This egg was laid in the nest Ibasket that
ad been initially provided. The nest basket was a brown plastic crate,
pleasuring 30cm x 75cm x 90cm. It was wired into place 135cm above the
round, supported by an up-ended log for stability. The inside of the nest
/as lined with straw, pine needles, moss and dried grasses, in that order.
:he nest lining was built high enough to allow the birds to see over the
est edge. Other sources had reported that birds which were unable to
je over the nest rim while incubating would eventually abandon their
ests.
The incubation period for the third egg was 25 days. The chick was
3und dead, on the ground, the next day. Necropsy reported the cause
f death as possible trauma and hypothermia.
i The year 1986 continued with a number of unsuccessful nesting
ttempts. Finally on 4th August 1987, a Sun-Bittern chick hatched,
his time the incubation period of 28 days was slightly longer. At seven
ays old the chick was several shades of brown and grey. There were
(lack stripes running horizontally down the chick's back. This down
plour camouflaged the chick effectively in the nest box which could
e a useful defence mechanism against the predation of neonatal chicks
i the wild.
The parents fed the chick with newborn mice and mealworms exclu-
vely for the first 14 days, even though the food pan contained other
ems. Crickets were omitted from the diet due to their alleged tendency
3 impact young birds. At 15 days, the parents were observed carrying
uall bits of Zupreem and fish to the nest and feeding the chick.
On 23rd August the chick fledged at 18 days old. The parents con-
nued to feed the chick for seven days, and then ceased. The family
; io got along well and there was never any aggression observed. On
th September the chick was given a leg band, weighed (160gm) and moved
3 another aviary. The pair went back to nest immediately and reared
nother chick. The total number of eggs laid in 1987 was four, resulting in
*vo chicks which were hatched and reared by the parents and two which
&amp;apos;ere artificially incubated and hand-reared. All four chicks survived.
In 1988 the same pair produced three chicks from three clutches,
&amp;apos;ith one chick surviving to date.

BREEDING MUSSCHENBROEK'S LORIKEET
Neopsittacus m. musschenbroekii

north-west New Guinea. It is basically a green bird with yellowish streak:
on the crown and light green streaks at the cheeks and black lores. Tht
throat and breast are red and this extends to the abdomen. The underwinj
coverts are also red and there is a band of red on the flight feathers whicl
provides a dramatic flash of colour when the birds are in flight. The tai
is green, tipped with yellow, and the underside is a yellow-orange. Tht
legs are grey and the iris red.
Though at first sight sexually monomorphic, once my birds had beei
surgically sexed, it became apparent that the beak colour of the sexe
differed, that of the hens being straw-coloured while the cocks' beak
were deeper yellow. My birds turned out to be two cocks and threi
hens.
The Lorikeets were purchased in autumn 1986 and were housei
initially as a group in a small indoor aviary. Two pairs were soon formed
though the birds continued to live in harmony, one pair being dominan
within the group.
The diet consisted of nectar made by adding a teaspoonful of hone;
and a sprinkling of pollen grains to half a pint of warm water. To thi
was added Milupa 7 Cereal Breakfast and Mixed Fruit Dessert in equa
quantities; a smaller quantity of the rather strong tasting Spring Vegt
table Dinner was also included. The whole had the consistency of thii

Fruit offered was diced apple, grapes and dried figs which had been
&amp;gt;aked for 12 hours. When in season pomegranates were taken with
eat enthusiasm by one pair and the odd hen, though the second pair
*tally ignored them.
The Lorikeets enjoyed greenfood, taking sow thistle and chickweed
hen available; some lettuce and spinach was given and salad cress was
ovided daily and proved very popular.
Just prior to purchasing these birds I had read an article by Rosemary
3w in which she stated that seed formed a part of this species' diet and
is, indeed, proved to be the case. Safflower was taken in preference to
l other food but, together with sunflower, was rationed in an attempt
prevent obesity in the birds. Plain canary seed, mixed millets and pine
its were offered and spray millet, which had been soaked for 24 hours,
as given daily. This was sprinkled with SA37 twice weekly. Cuttlefish
me, mineral blocks and grit were all ignored.
Clean drinking water and bathing water were both offered daily and
lese birds proved regular bathers, particularly in sunny weather.
Regarding temperament, one hen was very steady from the outset and
ould readily approach the wire to investigate food items held in my
and. The other birds remained aloof and the cocks were positively
(nid.
I have read several references which state that lorikeets do not need
luch more care than parrots that are on a more seed-based diet. With this
would disagree! The nature of their food results in perches and indoor
ire rapidly becoming soiled and sticky, necessitating frequent washing,
ewspaper was used on the feeding shelves and floors of indoor compart -
ents and this had to be changed at least every other day. Further, damp
itumn and spring weather caused nectar and droppings that had been
jposited on wall surfaces to go mouldy with remarkable speed, this again
quiring frequent cleaning. I find seed-eating birds much more easily
aintained.
In May 1987 the birds were placed in outdoor aviaries, one measuring
) x 6 ft (4.57 x 1.83m), the other being 12 x 6 ft (3.66 x 1.83m). In
)th cases, one-third of the aviary had solid sides and roof, which gave
uch appreciated seclusion, and the Lorikeets also had access to a small
door flight in which they spent much of their time. Nest-boxes measuring
in square x 12 in deep (0.15m square x 0.30m) were provided in the
wered part of the aviaries and shavings were used as a nest base. Despite
surances by authors that lorikeets always roost in nest-boxes, mine had
iviously not been informed of this and steadfastly refused to enter them,
eferring to roost in the most exposed part of the flight against the

netting (thankfully double). Removal of perches in an attempt to persuade
them to change their habits failed as the birds just returned to the place
where the perches had been and roosted on the wire!
After some months of this behaviour the Lorikeets did start to use
their nest-boxes, one pair preferring their box to be at the covered end ol
the flight, whilst the second pair would use the nest if it was positioner
in the open.
Interestingly this latter pair changed their habits when they went t(
nest, using a second box positioned under cover.
Aviary furnishings consisted of the branches of apple, elderberry ant
willow and the birds enjoyed stripping the bark from these. Willov
appeared to be preferred to all others and when fresh, the Lorikeets woult
take small pieces of bark in their beaks and this was then rubbed over thei
legs and feet and amongst their feathers. I am unsure of the significance o
this, though the behaviour reminded me of anting seen in other species.
The Lorikeets were initially in aviaries some distance apart and ther
was much vocal contact between the pairs. Later in the year they wei
moved closer together and judging by their behaviour it was apparent the
this close proximity was to the birds' liking.
They wintered outside with no heat provided though both pairs wei
using their boxes. The birds appeared unperturbed by the cold, thoug
translucent plastic sheeting was placed on the exposed north and ea
facing sides of the aviaries. By this time the unpaired hen had gone to
friend who had a spare cock bird.
In early February 1988, the hen of Pair 1 (the relatively steady hei
started to spend part of the day in the nest-box and an inspection on tl
17th revealed two white, rather spherical eggs, very approximately tl
size of a blackbird's. Only the hen appeared to carry out incubation dutie
and she sat tight, rarely being seen in the flight. On 11th March I thoug]
I heard a chick but did not interfere with the birds. Meanwhile, judgii
from the behaviour of Pair 2 they too were nesting, though in this ca
the cock spent a great deal of time in the nest-box.
On the morning of 17th March, all four birds were in the flights ai
appeared much disturbed. I checked both nests and found that of Pair
empty with no trace of eggs or chicks while Pair 2 had two eggs, o
apparently clear and both were cold.
During the above nesting activities I rarely saw the birds displayir
though the cocks would lean over their mates when excited and op
their wings momentarily exposing the vivid red of their flight feathe
I also observed the cock of Pair 2 enact a display prior to mating in whi
he walked in a wide arc on a wooden platform positioned in the flig
close to a perch on which the hen was sitting. His body was held ai

ight angle away from his mate and his head was held outstretched, lhis
jias performed a number of times in quick succession, and on each occa-
on he would then fly to the hen and approach her before repeating the
brformance. Treading eventually occurred which was achieved rapidly,
le cock bird balancing with outstretched wings.
Pair 1 nested again in May with one egg being present on the 6th, and
was while incubation of this clutch was underway that 1 realised how
t)cal the sitting hen was, producing a loud chick-like call which proved
resistible to the local cat population. With this in mind, and the failure
f the first round, it was decided to incubate the eggs artificially and
and-rear any chicks that hatched. These eggs were duly collected by
atabird Worldwide on 19th May and though both hatched, one chick
ied at two days old, the other being successfully hand-reared.
 |The first egg hatched on 31st May giving an incubation period of 25
r 26 days. The chick was covered in grey down with a small circle of
rhite down in the nape of the neck. This bird was collected from Data-
ird on 31st July when it was fully independent, though it still liked to
e spoon-fed. It resembled the adults in plumage though the red on the
reast and abdomen was less extensive than in the mature birds.
Pair 1 went down yet again on 18th June, closely followed by Pair 2,
nd I feel that there was a degree of stimulation between the pairs result-
ig in a certain synchronisation of nesting. The fact that Pair 2 did not
est in May was due, I believe, to the length of time their first clutch was
'ft with them, the single fertile egg failing to hatch.
The eggs were again taken for artificial incubation and of the four
ertile eggs, three hatched, one being dead-in-shell, though only one chick
ras successfully reared, the others again dying shortly after hatching. No
iirther attempt at nesting was made by either pair.
The decision as to whether or not to allow the parent birds to hatch
*nd rear their chicks can be a difficult one, particularly with a species not
yell represented in aviculture. The above results of two chicks from six
ggs does not appear to be a very good record.
i However, following the loss of the first clutches I felt that artificial
earing might result in some chicks reaching adulthood and my plan was to
flow the parents to rear their chicks themselves in 1989. Sadly my plans
ave been thwarted; I lost the cock of Pair 2 in the autumn as a result of a
apeworm infection. He was treated for this condition though I regret that
he treatment came too late. Also, the first chick to be reared died suddenly
t six months old and a post mortem failed to reveal the cause of death,
&amp;apos;he remaining birds have subsequently gone to a fellow aviculturist as
&amp;gt;ressure of work meant that I was unable to continue to give them the
ttention that they required. I hope they will nest with similar enthusiasm
or him.

I believe that this is the first time that this species has been bred in this
country and I hope that those keeping Musschenbroek's Lorikeets wi
make every effort to increase stocks of this bird, attractive in both colour
and character.

BREEDING THE COLLARED FINCHBILL
Spizixos semitorques cinereicapillus

The Collared Finchbill and the only other member of the genus, the
Crested Finchbill Spizixos canifrons , belong to the Pycnonotidae, the
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.982911555555556" page_id="58074867"  page_num="8" year="" vol="">
Bulbuls. S. semitorques has two subspecies: S.s. semitorques from South
China, and S.s. cinereicapillus from Taiwan.
Both species of Finchbill were virtually unknown in British aviculture
until late 1986 when seven males were imported; since then large numbers
have been imported from Taiwan.
The Collared Finchbill is predominantly olive green with yellow in the
centre of the abdomen. The tail has a broad, dark brown, terminal band,
blending with the olive green. Its name derives from the broad white band

There is a white spot at the nostril and another at the base of the lower
andible. The sides of the head are streaked with white. As the name
iggests, the ivory-coloured bill is similar to the bill of a mannikin and is
lique to the two Spizixos species.
The feet and legs are flesh-coloured.
Recently I have been fortunate enough to purchase a sole cock of the
&amp;gt;minate race S. s. semitorques from China which differs in that the
loration is more blue-grey than olive but there are no other noticeable
gional differences.
In late 1987 I acquired a pair of the Taiwan race driereicapillus which
owed a difference between the sexes in overall size and coloration of the
\0x25A0ad, the male being larger and having bolder contrasts on the head.
My birds are fed on a strict diet of Claus Honey Food Type Ill in
dish, with diced fruit given separately. Birdquest additives are used
increase the birds' vitamin intake. They receive fresh water daily and
ve to bathe.
In 1988 the Collared Finchbills were placed in a small, planted flight
th an inside enclosure for feeding. The cock sang continuously and in
.ne nesting started in a clump of fir, 5ft (1.52m) above the ground. The
ist was made of coconut fibre. Two eggs were laid by 19th June and were
hite with purple spots concentrated towards the blunt end, which were
rrounded by underlying violet.
Two chicks hatched on 14th July which was surprising as most bulbul
Igs take 14 days to incubate. 1 can only assume that the first round was
failure. The chicks were typical of other bulbul chicks but the beaks
owed clearly that they were finchbills. They were left strictly alone
id the young were reared on mealworms but after fledging, at 15 days,
ostly Claus and fruit. The chicks were a very dark green with black
;ads; they had no tails and no method of controlling their flight so
.ey were placed inside. They cheeped a great deal but survived the
ght and were promptly shooed outside again by the parents the next
orning. They soon grew and their plumage changed to resemble that
&amp;apos; the parents. They were taken away at 40 days old.
Since then they have moulted out to be a pair so I have acquired
lother pair in order to breed unrelated Finchbills this year.

Garrulax milnei
AT PADSTOW TROPICAL BIRD GARDENS
(Cornwall)
By CHRISTOPHER M. HAINES

The Red-tailed Laughing Thrush Garrulax milnei is a bird of humi(
secondary mountain forest, scrubland and grassland at altitudes abovi
1000m, ranging from southern China (Yunnan and Tonkin) to Burma
Laos and Thailand (De Schauensee, 1984). Believed to be fairly abundan
in the wild, it was seen at Foxwarren Park in 1939, having been collected
by Charles Cordier, but appears to have been imported again only recentl}
and is not, as yet, widely seen in zoological collections, no doubt parti)
due to its sober plumage and skulking habit.
This species is closely related to the Red-headed Laughing Thrush
G. erythrocephalus, from which it may readily be distinguished by its
reddish (rather than yellowish) wings and tail. It has a rufous crown,
nape and hindneck; the lores, supercilium, cheeks and throat are black,
and the ear-coverts are silvery-grey. The underparts are grey, shading td
olive-grey on the under tail-coverts; the upper tail-coverts and rump are
olive. The iris is dark brown. The bill, legs and feet are black. This species
measures approximately 250mm long. It is not sexually dimorphic and
there is no reliable way of distinguishing between individuals, which are
not colour-ringed or have some distinctive feature.
A trio of these birds is kept here in an L-shaped flight, grassed and
planted with shrubs and small trees, around the bases of which are areas
of bare earth. The flight area is slightly over 90 square metres, and the
height is about two metres. Old Cornish stone walls form the angular
back of the flight, and both ends are protected by corrugated plastic
screens (behind one of these are housed a pair of White-crested Laugh-
ing Thrushes G. leucolophus). There are two small boxes (containing
perches) in which the food dishes are placed, and a roosting box in which
a lOOw bulb provides light and warmth during the period after fledging.
This box, which projects beyond the end of the flight, is about 600mm
square, and about a metre high, the base being about one metre above
the ground.
This accommodation is shared with a pair of White-cheeked Touracos
Tauraco leucotis. No sign of interspecific aggression has normally been
observed, but the Thrushes were seen to chase the Touracos occasionally
during the incubation and rearing periods. This has not been seen to happen

h the Red-headed Laughing Thrushes, which have been bred at Pad-
w in a mixed flight shared with touracos.
The Red-tailed Laughing Thrushes are fed on a diet of our own insec-
mixture, with smaller quantities of apple and diced ox heart, with
alworms and Vionate. The main feed is in the morning and mixed
it and mealworms are fed in the afternoon. During the development
the young, extra mealworms were provided - initially very small meal-
rms every two hours during the day, changed gradually to normal
,alworms at around midday and before dusk, in addition to extra
alworms during the usual feeds.
,The breeding trio were acquired as young adults in June 1987. They
moderately shy birds, similar in temperament to the Red-headed
^ghing Thush. They tend to spend most of their time either in the nest-
i bush, the branches in the back corner of the flight, or on the ground,
er which they hop rapidly. Only once has any intraspecific aggression
en observed. On that occasion, the chick was about three weeks old,
en two of the birds (presumably the pair) were perching in front of the
bd dish, positioned near the back corner of the flight; the two were
ling continuously and threatening the third adult, when it approached
) close. This bird was calling also and moving in an agitated manner
:ween the branches in the back corner and a bush near the front of
i aviary. After about 10 minutes, the calling subsided and the pair fed
p youngster. The first signs of possible breeding activity were shown in
d-April, when they were seen to be carrying plant material. By mid-
y pair formation was well under way, and the third bird was observed
;ng chased around the flight. During June and July, the nest began to
.e shape, being a fairly tidy cup-shaped construction of grass stems,
m fibres and other plant material.
The nest was on a wire platform, in a fork of a bush, near the roosting
x and away from the White-crested Jay Thrushes' aviary.
On 11th August, a white egg with brownish speckles, was seen in the
st, followed the next day by a second. These eggs were ejected on 25th
igust, and found to be infertile. On 30th August, the birds were again
in to be sitting on two eggs. Due to the difficulties of distinguishing
;; gender or the individual identity of the birds, it was not obvious which
d, or birds, incubated the eggs.
The first egg hatched on 16th September, and the second two days
er, so the incubation period appeared to be about 17-18 days, which is
ghtly longer than would be expected. By comparison, 14-15 days is the
;ubation period given for the Red-headed Laughing Thrush (Coles, 1979).
I three adult Red-tailed Laughing Thrushes fed the very small meal-
&amp;gt;rms to the two chicks and within a week both chicks were nearly fully

feathered. The head and wings feathered up most rapidly. At that stage the
plumage was uniform dull greyish-brown, with the rufous patches not ye
being obvious.
By 2nd October, when both birds left the nest at about two weeks olq
the plumage had changed to echo that of the adults, although the colon;
were rather less pronounced, and their tails were quite short.
During the evening of 3rd October, the smaller chick was found on tf
aviary floor and though its condition did not look entirely satisfactory,!;
was left in the flight as the adults were still seen to be feeding it. The ft
lowing morning, however, it was in poor condition; it was seen to 1
chilled and immediately removed and placed in an incubator, whei
unfortunately it failed to recover. The loss of this chick prompted serioi
consideration as to whether to remove the other chick for hand-rearir|
However, as it appeared to be perfectly healthy and was back in the nes
being fed by the parents, it was decided to leave it in the flight.
This decision proved to be wise, as the parents continued to rear th
chick. When it was four weeks old, the light in the roosting box was turne
off for the first time during the day. At around that time it was fm
observed flying and pecking at the ground, though still being fed entire!
by the parents. By 18th October (at 32 days old), it was pecking at ti
nest, and also at leaves and twigs of the nest bush. The adults were see 1
adding further material to the nest. Around that time, the amount c
food supplied by the parents after each feed had decreased considerabj
and it became apparent that the young bird was partly able to feed itsel;
It was also flying fairly well.
On 23rd October the nest was largely destroyed. When the livefoo
was introduced - as usual being scattered over an area of bare earth - tf
chick was not seen to receive any food, though it continued to hop alor,
the branches, between the adults. It was also observed indulging in mutu:
preening with one of the adults. Two days later, it was seen begging fc
mealworms immediately after some had been introduced. The aduli
appeared to ignore much of the begging behaviour, either retreating aloii
the branch or merely looking away, but occasionally one would transft
a mealworm into the youngster's gape.
On 28th October, the day after the light in the roosting box was firs
left switched off overnight, the young bird was observed feeding itse
for the first time. At six weeks old it was seen to take mealworms, thoug
rather inexpertly. However, the parents were still feeding it. Two day
later it was first seen to take fruit (apple), and the next day was observe
standing in the food dish, taking both apple and insectile mixture, thoug
continuing to drop much of the former. At that stage the midday an
evening mealworm feeds were discontinued.

Regarded then as being fully independent, the young Laughing Thrush
as ringed on 2nd November, so that it might subsequently be distinguished
pm the original adults. It had not yet attained full adult plumage, the
sic coloration being a medium greyish-brown, with the rufous crown and
ddish wings not yet as bright as those of the adults and the silvery ear-
verts not as noticeable. However, at the time of writing (17th November
"88) it is sufficiently similar to the adults to require a second glance to
entify it.

Aviculturists have progressed considerably in recent decades at b
replacement parents for young birds. However, progress in the area:
nutrition and brooding has been greater than that in nest sanitation - tl
the parents definitely have the edge on efficiency. Especially with parr
keeping a chick clean requires frequent changes of bedding and frequ
c eamng. At the Bronx Zoo we have evolved a technique which wc
exceptionally well, especially for species like the Pesquet's Parrot wh
produces very soft faeces. This method has also been useful for ot
parrot species, including the Palm Cockatoo, and for touracos. Essentia
chicks are suspended on a screen which allows droppings to fall throu
usually on to a pan which can be removed for cleaning (see plates).
The container is constructed from two cylinders with slightly slop
sides. Early models were made from one quart yogurt containers-
chicks grew larger, we used buckets which had originally contained w;
paper paste. Slightly more sophisticated versions have since been creal
out of plastic freezer containers.
_ . The , n * 0r material is a rubberised mesh ('Neotex' matting from Thoi
Scientific), commonly used by laboratories to line sinks as a protection

Mesh openings are 7mm x 7mm and the gridwork is one millimetre w

ot lighter species begin to perch long before this time.

rare once I found myself in an exotic country over a long weekend, instead c! i
travelling, and I had determined to take advantage of it by 'getting away fro,
it all'. I flew down to Cebu City on the island of Cebu, then drove thre:
hours or so over the mountain ridge and down the south-west coast. J
short boat ride took me to a genuine tropical island paradise in the Sou!!
China Sea, Badian Island. There, for almost three days I sunbathed, swar
ate fresh fruit and seafood -- and studied the Black-headed Munia.
I can just hear somebody laugh, saying that if you're going to trave
halfway around the world to watch birds you might as well watch some
thing worthwhile, or at least different. That's OK, I've watched Monkey
eating Eagles and Victoria Crowned Pigeons and Trogons and Bellbird;
I just happen to be inordinately fond of finches and for me, to discove
several flocks of one of my best-loved birds was a real thrill. The smaller
flock was eight birds, the largest 14. They appeared every morning an
afternoon feeding on the ground in the garden around my bungalow am
around the swimming pool. On several occasions my Nikon 7 x 50 bine
culars were focussed down to their very nearest point, so close did th
birds come to me. I have kept munias on and off for 40 years now but th
was the first time I'd seen them feeding naturally, and it was fascinating.
The birds were feeding on grasses dotted with weeds of the Compc
sita family, some looked like dandelions, others groundsel. A bird woul
fly at a bunch of stalks with feet spread and grasp several stems of gras
Its forward momentum would bend the bunch over slightly and the bir
would be able to reach at the seeding heads where it would take up t
half-a-dozen beakfuls before flying on. Often as not, a bird would land o
a single stem of grass, its weight would bear the stem to the ground
whereupon the birds would quickly hop along to the head of the grass an
take several bites. The weeds would invariably be borne to the groun
where part of the seeding head was bitten off and eaten. The flock move
on, covering an area roughly 5-10 square metres at a time, never exhaustin
the seed supply. After they had gone, there was no sign that they had bee:
there feeding, no grass stems were broken - all had sprung back up again.
When disturbed, the birds would fly into the nearby Bougainvillaea&amp;apos;
other shrub and sit still. Not for the first time was I amazed at how bright

to have black heads while others had distinctly dark brown heads. I wa
reminded of my Brown-headed Munias at home, which are of another rac
of L. malacca than the one that I am describing on Badian Island. In m
birds the head of the male is distinctly darker than that of the female, an
I wondered if that were also the case with the birds I was watching. Froi
time to time it seemed as though there were several bonded pairs in a floe
as two birds would often appear to be working the grasses together,
noticed this several times. It also seemed to me that in every case of a
apparent pair, one bird had a blacker head and more noticeable yello
fringe to the tail edges.
At this point it is appropriate to discuss the species as a whole.
Nomenclature
In his invaluable Estrildid Finches of the World, Derek Goodwin intr
duces the Lonchura munias with a discussion on their relationships 1
each other. He separates them into several species-groups, one of which
maja, malacca and pallida.

Essentially, Goodwin concludes that these birds are all races of 1
single species L. malacca. For convenience of handling in his book
keeps them separate but confuses by referring to each one as the 'Chesti
Munia'. In their fascinating but highly technical paper on the evolution;
genetics of Estrildidae, Kakizawa and Watada use protein electrophorc
to construct a genealogic dendrogram to define genetic distances betw&lt;
various estrildids. They found there to be no genetic distance betw&lt;
L. atricapilla, malacca and maja but ferruginosa was not included in thei
research. Therefore, they support, by electro-chemical analysis, w
Goodwin concludes by logic.
Following the Geographic Species Concept, which holds that if t
birds occupy the same area but do not normally or naturally interbre
then they are not conspecific, it seems sensible to me to regard L. m
and L. pallida as sibling species but nonetheless separate species. Th&lt;
fore I offer the Chestnut or Black-headed Munia Lonchura malacca

The above descriptions are perforce superficial but serve to aid di:
crimination between the races. The nominate L.m. malacca is not typicz
of the species because of the white on the breast and flanks, similar!
L.m ferruginosa with white on the head and black from bib to unde
tail is singularly easy to recognise. The rest have the body chestnut-brow

e colour of the upper tail-coverts and edges to the tail feathers is weaker
females. The oilmen of the male is usually slightly higher and fuller and
ay be felt more as a bump when running your forefinger along the crown
I to the oilmen (see Restall, 1987, on the Black-rumped Munia). Males,
course, may be distinguished by their song, and display. Incidentally, I
tomatically place coloured plastic split rings on every new bird I acquire
d keep a record card. When any noteworthy incident - such as a song
splay, or nest-building is noticed, it is written down against the colour
de for that bird. It is amazing how easy it is to forget whether the bird
at sang was the pink left, or the white right.
Juveniles are apparently indistinguishable between races until they
gin to show adult feathering. They are dull brown above and pale brown
low, one might say 'mousy'.
Habitat and feeding
They are primarily birds of grassy areas, from rice fields to gardens,
ey are gregarious, moving around in small groups, often in large flocks
Len not breeding, feeding on seeds and young, forming seed heads on
j ground and on standing plants, mostly grasses and weeds that grow
tong grasses. The species is very widespread over most of the Indian
d SE Asian region. When disturbed, they retreat to nearby cover but
ickly return to the grassy areas to resume feeding.
In captivity they readily take canary and millet seeds. I have seen
wly-caught birds feeding on paddy hung in bunches in the cages. I
ve brought back bunches of this paddy from my travels and the birds
: it as avidly as millet sprays, but in my experience will rarely take
iddy loose from the ground or when mixed with other seed. Flower-
g and seeding grasses are taken readily. Lettuce and chickweed may be
ken. None of my Lonchura have ever taken soft foods, not even Ben-
lese, although I have found sufficient references in the past to suggest
at soft food should be offered (Restall, 1975). They are great bathers
td their plumage condition will be reflected in the frequency with
hich they are able to bathe.
Voice
The first pair of birds I ever kept was a pair of L.m. malacca, and
ey lived short, fruitless lives in a Yorkshire Canary show cage. Their
cessant peet call to contact others of their kind fascinated me, and
ove my old step-father crazy. One thing I have noticed with several
ecies of munia recently is that the males and females have different
II notes, but can find no reference to this in the literature. With some
ecies, like L. quinticolor, L. grandis and L. leucogastroides it is quite

noticeable. My pair of L. leucosticta sound almost like Zebra Finche:
a tooting beee that seems the same from each bird, but as I am not 100
sure that they are not two females, it is not significant that I cannot te
them apart. Ironically, I have sat down to write these notes, inspired b
watching L.m. jagori, having given away my last trio of L.m. formosam
so I cannot separate the birds and begin a controlled study.
I do suggest to anybody with easy access to a few of any race of th
species to cage them separately and listen carefully to see if they ca
detect any difference in the call note. It is a tonal difference, not a di
ferent sound.
Nesting and breeding
The nest is naturally a sphere of grasses or leaves from grass-like plan
woven among bamboo, in a shrub or thicket, usually within human reac
of the ground - or occasionally over water. The entrance hole is on th
side with a slight tunnel protruding. The inner lining is of finer grasse
In an aviary they will build their own nest of raffia, reeds and grasses
the conditions are right. I have had L.m. sinensis build in a bark fram
work stuffed with dried hay and grasses, also L.m. formosana.Xn each
case the entrance tunnel was some three inches long and the cavity line
with coconut fibre. On two separate occasions L.m. formosana nested i
an Australian finch box (square with a half-open front) in which I ha
twisted a handful of dead grasses and coconut fibre. Eggs were laid sever
times but were deserted before hatching almost certainly due to distu
bances caused by local cats.
The eggs are small, oval and white. My birds laid clutches of thrc
four and five but a normal clutch in the wild is apparently five or six ar
may be of seven. Both male and female share the nest-building, incub
tion and rearing of the young. The young are not super precocious lil
those of seedeating birds in the neo-tropics, but fledge between thn
and four weeks. Compare that to, say, a Jacarini Finch Volatina jacarin
which will fledge in nine or ten days!
There is no doubt that these munias will breed readily and easily, ar
rear on an all-seed diet, if conditions are suitable. What are suitable co
ditions? From my observations the first condition is not to have ar
distracting birds in the same enclosure or in the enclosure alongside
mean the other side of the wire mesh). My male Brown-headed Mun
was continually distracted by one or other of the Pallid Munias in tl
same flight.
He successfully stole her (?) away from the other (male?), usual
ignoring the two females of his own species. Once the Pallids were remove
he quickly paired and they nested in an Australian finch box. Later on

troduced some Great Munias L. grandis into the flight and once again he
came distracted, he became obsessed with courting whichever of the
gger 'super malaccas ' would sit next to him. His song and dance usually
,ded up with peering behaviour by the larger bird. So 1 removed the
own-heads as the grandis are very rare in captivity and I was trying to
eed with them. I have noticed this ability of male Lonchura to attempt
omiscuity several times and have concluded it is a major factor in inhibit-
g successful breeding. Perhaps two mated pairs is ideal, providing nest-
g sights are plentiful and widely spaced. The ideal method for me is to
ace four or more birds in an enclosure where they can be observed
thout disturbing the birds , once true bonded pairs are identified they
n be placed in suitable enclosures, only one pair to an enclosure - but
thin sight and sound of others as they are gregarious birds, and I believe
iis to be helpful.
Housing
I have bred munias in all-enclosed, wire-fronted cages, all-wire cages,
lall indoor flights, and large outdoor flights. There is no ideal and it is
ilittle cavalier to suggest the perfect enclosure. Having seen what many
astralians regard as 'normal', 1 suppose a large, sunny flight with many
g clumps of tall, seeding millet grass, open areas with seeding Poa annua
t d a few compositae, with some privet hedging to provide cover would
ideal. Food and water would be in a shelter area where the light comes
i at 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning and goes off at 7 or 8 o'clock in the
ening. Having lived in the tropics and neo-tropics 1 am very aware of
e birds having 13 hours or so of light all the year through, and con-
ler this essential. I have also come to the conclusion that tropical finches
ill often come into breeding condition in October/November, and if
ey have 12-14 hours of light, will breed then. At the time of writing
Jovember 1987) I have three species of Lonchura nesting in my bird-
iom.
My favourite cages are about 30in or 36 in (0.76 or 0.91m) cubes,
ecently I have been experimenting with putting plants in these cages,
provides distraction for the birds, but I am not convinced that it helps
ceding. However, a sense of security when humans are not around is
ry important. (It is even more important when we are around!).
Summary
The Black-headed Lonchura malacca is a widespread species, typical
Lonchura in habits and habitat. There are several races, often treated
distinct species in aviculture, but conversely are often treated as one
igle bird, the 'Chestnut Munia' in ornithological literature. Some races

are sexually dimorphic, with the males having darker-coloured heads, j
seems probable that males may have a different tone of contact call tha
females; if this can be confirmed, it would be an enormously helpfi
aid to aviculturists. They will settle and breed in confinement, both i
cage and aviary but can easily be distracted and if breeding is intende;
should be taken seriously by the keeper.

A magnificent pair of Green-winged Parrots which I saw on a recei
visit to the Hong Kong Botanical and Zoological Gardens brought back mer
ories of the days soon after the war when, as a university student, I cut le
tures occasionally to waste precious hours in front of one of the aviaries &lt;

the day when I might possess such avicultural treasures.
Green-winged King Parrots are even more striking in appearance tha
the better known Australian King Parrot A. scapularis scapularis. The
red is darker, and they have, as their name implies, a conspicuous band ol
yellowish green contrasting with the dark green of the rest of the win;
The mantle and the back are a lovely deep blue and the tail is marked!

[libit sexual dimorphism like that of the Australian King, but in Ac.
&amp;apos;szkowskii the sexual dimorphism is less marked and the hens differ
&amp;gt;m the cocks only in having the mantle and back green instead of
be.
The pair of the nominate race, which had been at the London Zoo for
r eral years, reared one chick in 1952 but it did not survive for long
er leaving the nest. They hatched another chick in the following year
t did not rear it. At about the same time there was another pair in the
[lection of Alfred Ezra, who was then President of the Avicultural
ciety. This pair reared six young during the period 1945-1954. They
re seen regularly by the members of the Avicultural Society at the
iightful annual garden parties at Foxwarren Park. When Ezra died,
;y were acquired by Crawford McCullagh with whom they appeared to
poorly for when he died a few years later there was only one female
t. This was obtained by Alfredo Marques who also got an unmated male
&amp;gt;m Gerry Kirkham. The pair produced two young but then the cock

London Zoo there was a very scruffy, partly bald, old cock which the
rator of Birds, John Yealland, let Alfredo Marques have on loan. Sur-
singly, it mated successfully with the hen which hatched four chicks.
&amp;gt;wever, disaster struck when the birds were given chickweed which had
en sprayed very recently with toxic weedkiller. All the Green-winged
ngs and many other birds died.
As far as I know, these were the last Green-winged Kings of the nomi-
te race in this country. However, about ten years ago several of the race
&amp;gt;szkowskii were imported. They were very difficult to establish being
ry shy feeders and loath to eat hard, dry seed which is not surprising
ice, in the wild, they subsist mainly on berries, fruit, nuts and blossom.

IMPING: A PRACTICAL METHOD TO REPAIR FEATHERS

Imping is a technique that has been used by falconers for centurie
to repair the broken or damaged feathers of their hawks and falcon:
It is simply the process of glueing in a new feather that has been she
previously by the same bird or any other individual or species that he
similar feathers. It can be a very valuable tool for the aviculturist wh
requires an immediate return to flight of a bird that has had its win#
trimmed.
It is a great pity but often birds are imported which have no specif:
value to the aviculturist or breeder as they are commonly available, lac
brilliant colours, are difficult to care for or may be abundant and difficu
to breed. In this situation, the lucky individuals will end up as pets in
home where they are cared for properly and allowed to settle down into
relatively stable environment. Sooner or later these birds are sougl
out by the aviculturist. Most of us at one time or another have come b
a perfect candidate for our breeding programme which, indeed, has bee
a pet and may have a wing or wings trimmed.
Birds that have been in a stable environment for some time do mak
excellent breeders. The close proximity to humans in a small, undisturbe
territory (their cage) generally produces a very tame personality so vit:
to captive breeding. If the individual is tame it will display all the nece:
sary behaviour essential for breeding with very little regard for huma
presence. This type of bird will most certainly make a good breedin
bird in a relatively short time.
These pet birds may have been common when they were originall;
imported and now they may very well be important genetically for th
survival of the species, at least in captivity. Quite often these birds wi]
have their wing feathers clipped to prevent the damage that may be don
to the home or themselves if they had been allowed to fly. A good situa
tion for the pet owner but not so good for the aviculturist. There is m
reason why you must wait a full year for a bird to moult in new feathers
This situation may be repaired quickly, easily and with no pain to th
bird.
Falconers fly their birds daily if the bird is not in moult and it i
naturally very important to every falconer to have his bird fit and ii
perfect feather. This definitely is one measure of his ability to care fo
these birds. Having a bird in feather perfect condition helps to insur

best possible performance in the field from the hawk. Feathers may
:asionally be broken while engaging the prey species chosen by the
boner but more often than not, it is a product of poor perching or
oroper handling. This is quite different from the aviculturisf s problem
sere the wing feathers were intentionally trimmed, but the same repair
:"cedure will work.
In order for imping to work correctly, the bird must have the hollow
rtion of the shaft still in place in the wing. This is the part to which
a will be attaching the chosen replacement. It is helpful to have the
others you plan on using laid out in the order in which they are to be
ached to the body to avoid last minute confusion. The bird will be
dipped up in a towel and should only be held in this situation for as
s"rt a time as possible. If the procedure does take a long time, the pro-
is should be completed in two sessions to keep the stress to a mini-
m. Perhaps a trial run on a pigeon or chicken to become familiar with
technique might make you more familiar with the process. Be or-
lised and have all materials ready and at hand.
An assistant should hold the bird in a towel with the wing that is to
repaired exposed and accessible. The best place to start is closest to
body. This will make it much easier to trim the feathers in such a way
to follow the natural line of the wing and create a normal flight sur-
e. Re-create the flight surface as accurately as possible so the bird
usts to this new wing easily. If it is difficult to determine the natural
b of the trailing edge of the wing, make the feathers too short rather
in on the long side. It must be quite a shock to the bird to be able to
immediately after this procedure when perhaps it had not flown for
ny years.
The first replacement feather and shaft in the wing should be trimmed
the hollow area so that they line up leaving the tip of the feather
lowing a natural line. Then a small piece of bamboo or other lightweight
rdy wood should be trimmed to fit snugly into the replacement feather,
mboo seems to be the best as it is very flexible and easy to carve,
turally the cut should be as far away from the body as possible leaving
arge base still in the wing from which to attach the feather. Leave this
od inserted in the replacement feather and cut it off at the depth of the
How base remaining in the bird's wing. Care should be taken not to
it the feather shaft as the bamboo splint is inserted. Now whittle down
* bamboo carefully so it also fits snugly into the hollow base and the
ther should look normal and natural in place with no rough edges
ere the join is made.
Obviously this will not stay in place by itself so the join should be
it apart slightly to add a few drops of glue. The best type of glue to

3 is one of the so-called 'super glues'. These are very viscous and will
*w into the hollow portion of the feather around the carved wooden
;ert quite easily. After applying a few drops of glue, push the join back
gether quickly and line the tip up with the existing feathers. Take care
t to get this glue on the other feathers. In a few moments this will dry
d you will be ready for the next feather and so on, out to the tip of
e wing.
When the bird is placed in an aviary, you may notice that it has trouble
ing. This will more than likely be due to the fact that muscles are out
shape and the individual is not accustomed to the wings actually work-
t correctly. It might be a good idea to add a few extra perches in the
ary. By treating the bird as if the wing were still trimmed, the bird will
i/e sufficient time to learn how to fly again and find those long-lost
nscles.

The 1988 breeding season was very busy with 94 species producing
;s and 226 individual specimens reared. Three species of penguins pro-
:ed eggs: Adelie Pygoscelis adeliae, Rockhopper Eudyptes crestatus and
!: King Aptenodytes patagonica. Only the King Penguin eggs were fertile
i one chick was reared. This is the tenth chick produced in the last ten
irs.
A total of 42 species of waterfowl laid eggs but unfortunately a large
mber of eggs were either infertile or died during incubation. Some

one hen laid eggs in 1988. Ten eggs hatched and nine young were rea
to independence.
The first egg produced by the King Vultures Sarcorhamphus p
was pulled for artificial incubation. This egg hatched and the chick
successfully hand-reared. A second fertile egg was produced and pu

second egg hatched the male was separated from the female and the ch
was introduced to the nest. The female fed and brooded the chick ;
became quite protective of the nest. The second chick was successfi
reared but the male was never able to be reintroduced to the ferr

The Bateleur Eagles Terathopius ecaudatus laid three fertile eggs,
of which were removed for artificial incubation. While three eggs 1

By JEFFERY BOSWALL
(Bristol)
In February 1988, I travelled in China from Beijing (Peking) in the
:th to Shenzen (next to Hong Kong) in the south and visited zoos in
an (Sian), Nanjing (Nanking) and Nanchang.
The last-named city had the smallest zoo and a near-complete census
s possible. Time at the other two zoos was limited and counting was
iited to the larger birds.
In the tables the birds are in systematic order and the common and
pntific names follow de Schauensee (1984).

A spacious, reasonably modern zoo with a series of terraced orna-
ntal lakes.
Nanjing Zoo
This establishment is situated on one of several islands in a large lake
a large city park. It is a fraction old-fashioned.
Nanchang Zoo
A small zoo in a smallish city park. The waterfowl and cranes appeared
be in very good condition.

Note: In the case of Nanchang Zoo, many waterbirds were unpinioned
d kept in flight cages. Otherwise waterbirds were occupying ornamental
ices and most appeared to be pinioned. So far as I am aware, or could
certain, all birds in unenclosed areas were captive, but there could have
:en an admixture of wild individuals.
The ration of indigenous to exotic birds
As shown for Chengdu (Chengtu) Zoo by Boswall (1986), these three
ios' avian populations were also dominated by Chinese species. If we set
:.de the Xi'an data, because a number of bird houses were not visited, and
e the censuses at the other two zoos, then we find that at Nanjing, of
1 species, 43 (88%) were Chinese. Comparable figures for Nanchang are:
"species in all, of which 32 (89%) are Chinese.
Endangered birds
All three zoos held birds listed by King (1978-79) in the ICBP/IUCN
id Data Book for China.
Of the Oriental race of the White Stork Gconia ciconia (regarded by
; Schauensee as a full species, the Oriental White Stork C. boyciana),
Total of 11 were in captivity. This form, boyciana , is rare. It nests in the
:"viet Far East and in north-east China. Probably only a few thousand
:rds exist in the wild. Regarded as endangered.
One zoo had one White-tailed Eagle Haliaeetus albicilla. Regarded as
ilnerable. This species has a very wide distribution in Eurasia.
Two zoos had at least six Brown Eared Pheasants Crossoptilon mant-
uricum. Regarded as endangered, and clearly rightly so as this species,
i the wild, is globally confined to three reserves in Shanxi province in
liina(Kind, 1986).
All three zoos had captive Japanese (Red-crowned) Cranes Grus jap-
lensis, nine in all. This species is regarded as vulnerable. It breeds in the
I3SR, in Japan and in China.
Again in each of the establishments there were Hooded Cranes G. mon-
ha , though fewer, the total being only three birds, one at each zoo.
bgarded as vulnerable. The Hooded Crane nests only in China and the
ISSR.
All three zoos also held White-necked Cranes G. vipio, the total being
&amp;gt; birds. Regarded as vulnerable. It nests only in China and the USSR.
Unsurprisingly, only one zoo had a captive Siberian Crane G. leuco-
\ranus. A fine-looking individual at Nanchang Zoo appeared to be cap-
de of flight. Regarded as endangered, since less than 2,000 birds are left
the wild. Most winter in China. The bird breeds in the USSR, but may

FURTHER NOTES ON FERAL ROSE-RINGED PARRAKEU
Psittacula krameri
IN KENT
BY DEREK GOODWIN

Members might be interested in the latest news of the local Rost
ringed Parrakeets, of which I wrote in our Magazine in 1983 (Vol. SS
84-93) and more briefly in 1987 (Vol. 93: 235-236).
In 1988 at least three pairs nested and I think that young fledged froi
two nests but am not absolutely certain of this as I was away at the tim
that the actual fledging apparently took place.
At the third nest the pair behaved as though young had been remove
from or died in the nest though there was nothing to suggest huma
predation.
In November and December I heard and saw the birds seldom an
never more than three, but in the past ten days the usual late wink
visiting of old, and prospecting of new nest sites has started. I think thei
are about nine or ten birds in all, possibly more, although I have not ha
more than seven in sight at any one time.
Yesterday, when with a friend looking for the Parrakeets in a sma
wood where two pairs nested last year in adjacent dead Alder stump
(in very old woodpecker holes), we soon located five birds and wit
them, to our surprise, was an Alexandrine Parrakeet Psittacula eupatria.
Although associating with the Rose-rings to some extent, it tende
often to fly, calling loudly, and to perch by itself. Once it showed gre#
interest in an old Green Woodpecker hole high in a tree, clinging an
looking in several times, then entering and spending some minutes i

3 hole, frequently looking out, before coming out and flying off.
About 20 minutes later what was almost certainly the same bird
was either a hen or an immature cock) was in the old 'field Ash' about
If a mile away. A pair of Rose-rings was also there; one of them was
acked by, and had feathers torn from its body by a Starling, when
tried to investigate the hole in which, in bygone years, Rose-ringed
rrakeets nested yearly with no apparent success.
After a few minutes the Alexandrine took wing and, calling at inter-
s, flew back toward, and then into the wood where we had first seen
Although, 'in the field' the size difference between the two species was
t very obvious and the carmine shoulder patches only evident when
rly close views were obtained, the heavier build and much larger bill of
i Alexandrine was immediately noticeable in flight, even when it was
ly seen flying from tree to tree within the wood. When I saw it in open
&amp;gt;ht the wing beats appeared slower and the wings to beat through a
ier arc than those of the Rose-ringed Parrakeet.
Since it is unlikely that another Alexandrine of opposite sex will escape
1 turn up here, I fear this bird is going to be frustrated in its obvious
sire to breed. I hope indeed that it will not interfere with the nesting of
* Rose-rings.
Though I have, of course, seen the Alexandrine before in captivity, I
fQ never before seen one flying free and this was a new experience and
ight for me. All the same, imposing though the bird is, I do not think
! s as beautiful as the more dainty and elegant Rose-winged Parrakeet.
I must sadly add that, unless the young birds disperse to other places,
&amp;apos; yearly breeding of our local Rose-ringed Parrakeets does not even com-
isate for yearly losses as there are, I think, only about half to two-
rds the number that there were ten years ago.
Footnote: The Alexandrine has been seen several times since, the last by me on
:h February 1989, when she was clearly paired to a cock Rose-ringed. Despite
at I have said above, when the two were perched side by side, the size difference
? at once evident

Every year countless parrots, common and rare, are bred in confii
ment. Aviculturists as a whole take it for granted that someone has record
the down colour of the young, size of the eggs, or even sexual dimorphic

these data are presented.

sulphurea or other 'yellow-crested' subspecies. There is also a major d
ference between sulphurea and citrino-cristata ; the bill of immatu
sulphurea is whitish coloured until the bird is about seven months ol
whereas it turns black in the Citron-crested at about three or four wee
old. The legs are mottled grey and flesh coloured until approximately t]
same time that the bill changes in sulphurea but in citrino-cristata this
black before the fourth week. Citron-crested Cockatoo chicks develc
faster, and this, along with the aforementioned characteristics as well
conspicuous behavioural differences, seems to indicate that citrino-crista
deserves specific rank.

This splendid book deals with all the gamebirds of the world - curassows,
Jns, chachalacas, turkeys, grouse, partridges, quail, pheasants, junglefowl,
heafowl, megapodes, brush turkeys and their allies.
It has been written with the aviculturist much in mind and starts off
h chapters on the general care and breeding of gamebirds in captivity.
;n follows the bulk of the book in which there is an introduction to
h family or, depending on the number of species involved, each group
related species within a family. This is followed by accounts of the
nponent species. These include description (including those of geo-
phical races and colour mutations), distribution, habitat, ecology and
laviour and, where known, the species' history and needs in captivity,
h the general introductory section the author appears dismissive ot
ier feeding methods. Offering a choice of grains, greenfood, fruit, egg,
s, etc., is said to be, in effect, offering a 'calorie bomb' to the birds,
the use of 'modern' and 'scientific' poultry foods is recommended. On
other hand, in the species sections, the accounts of and implied advice
feeding is often of a more old fashioned kind.
laving myself only kept three easy species - Golden and Common
isants and Red-legged Partridge - and that in the now distant past, I
I have little basis for comment. I must say, however, that without
jption all the commercially kept poultry I have seen, or seen photo-
&amp;gt;hs of, have been in deplorable condition, though whether this was in
e of, or because of the modern scientific foods on which they were fed,
&amp;gt;not know.
rhe species accounts are comprehensive, well written and fully ref-
iced. (I was glad to see several references to articles that have appeared
)ur magazine.) They contain a wealth of information on behaviour
n which I feel sure most of us will be able to learn many facts we did
know before. For example, that Ptarmigan Lagopus mutus dustbathe
;now and that their chicks must have a real live parent or parent sub-
jte and cannot be reared with only an artificial source of warmth,
rhere are numerous good black and white illustrations and, unless I
e miscounted, 292 colour photographs. Most of these colour photo-
3hs are excellent and with good colour reproduction. Many of them
also of great interest, for example, the Mallee Fowl testing the tem-
ature of its incubator while its mate stands nearby (p. 752), the pair
Celebes Maleos on their nest mound and many of various pheasants
claying. The colour photos also show many species of which I have

At 198 DM this may seem an expensive book but to anyone who
interested in gamebirds (except those who merely wish to kill them f(
fun) and can read German it is worth every penny. Indeed anyone wh
can afford to do so, even if he or she cannot read German, will find tl
book well worth buying for the pictures alone. I can recommend it ui
reservedly.

'An interesting and informative article by Professor Paul Roth coi

thinus in the wild is featured in a recent American Cage-Bird Magaziru
This well-known bird is drastically declining throughout much of i
range, the main reason being thought to be the capture of birds for ti 1
pet trade. Professor Roth states that there are probably more Hyacii
thine Macaws in captivity than are now left in the wild, with an est
mated wild population of only 3,000 to 4,000 individuals. The recer
removal of this species from CITES appendix 2 to appendix 1 will, i 1
is hoped, restrict further trade in this macaw. Once again aviculturis*
have a chance to prove their worth by making every effort to breed th
magnificent species.

It was not until mid-1988, when Loro Parque in Tenerife received four
cimens of the mysterious Eos that I had the opportunity to see it. It
irs no resemblance to the ' wallacei ' that I saw - a much larger bird.
It is the smallest Eos, about the size of a Perfect Lorikeet Trichoglossus
eles and the head and upper breast are entirely red except for a few
ttered greyish-mauve feathers around the neck. In my opinion this is
i squamata obiensis from the island of Obi. I have not had the oppor-
dty to examine any skins - but obiensis has two features not shared
any other race: its very small size and its black scapulars (feathers on
upper part of the wing).
'If one reads Forshaw's descriptions of the races of squamata in Parrots
the World the same conclusion may not be reached because the varia-
ty of the head coloration is not emphasised. G.F. Mees (1965. The Avi-
na of Misool. Nova Guinea Zoology , Vol. 31: 161) makes this descrip-
i much clearer. He states of obiensis : "Characterized by the black
pulars. Development of the violet-grey collar is extremely variable; in
ie specimens it is practically absent, in one it is present, but incom-
te, in one it is well developed and broad, while in addition a dark crown
ch is present. Wing measurements male 134, 140, female immature 135,

The World Pheasant Association has been working for almost ten yea
now on the reintroduction of the endangered Cheer Pheasant into the Ma
galla Hills range near Islamabad, Pakistan. Birds from the release are know
to have survived for in excess of 20 months giving rise to hope that the
can be re-established from captive stock in this and other areas. A furthr
200 poults have been reared and released in 1988.
Encouraged by this success, attention is now being turned to other par
of the bird's former range and in particular the area north of Balakot at th
lower end of the Kaghan Valley. This area has been extensively replante
with Chir pine over the past 10 years and now, once more, provides mucl
ideal habitat.
The North West Frontier Province has a sizeable and well set up captiv
breeding centre at Dhodial - north of Abbottabad, and the first phase o
this new project is to establish a captive flock from which young can br
hatched and reared for release.
The World Pheasant Association, with help from Marwell Zoologica
Park in rearing the birds, and assistance from British Airways Assisting
Nature Conservation scheme have shipped out nearly thirty birds to star^
the foundation breeding flock.

Information needed on the Band-tailed Seedeater (Catamenia analis)
One South American seed-eater that is very rarely available, and has
:n mis-identified when it has appeared on the market, is the Band-
ed Seedeater from Colombia and Peru. I have only been able to find
nale of the species, and thus have been deprived of the opportunity
observe any of the behaviour of an inter-acting male and female. To
delight, I received a letter from Ian Wainhouse of Summerbridge, who
nost fortunate to own a pair of these birds. In his letter Ian described
courtship display of the male.
In my experience with the species the male has a pleasant song, but I
ed to keep a written description. Ian Wainhouse's notes include, '.
song is sort of three chirps and a burr, his display is on the ground,
id down, wings outstretched, tail up and spread, all the while croaking
3 a frog'. To my knowledge, the display ...any display....of this species
; not been described. Therefore I replied with a sketch of how I im-
ned the bird to posture, and the sketch with this letter is the version
t has been corrected and agreed by Ian.
I have noticed my male Sporophilas (several species) singing and dis-
ying to their females with wings drooped or spread, tails fanned. But

these displays have always been arboreal, from branch to branch, w
the males in pursuit of the females. The white patches on the primaries
male S porophila show well in these circumstances, as they do on the m
Catamenia. What may be of interest in comparing these two apparen
closely related genera is that the Sporophila do not have white in the t
whereas this particular Catamenia has large white patches on the ini
webs of the outer five rectrices.
May I ask any readers who have any knowledge of the Catamer,
however slight, to kindly send their notes to the Editor for publicatic

Mistaken or Multiple Identity?
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.988184192307692" page_id="58074907"  page_num="48" year="" vol="">
With reference to Robin Restall's article (Vo. 94:216) on the mistak
identity of birds, I feel that one aspect of avian identification was r,
covered, namely the multiplicity of scientific names given to certt
species. This is the situation that arises where the scientific name quot
for a particular bird may vary according to whatever source docume
for the name has been used.
An example of this was highlighted by Jeffrey Trollope in the sai
issue, in his article on the breeding of the Blue and White Flycatch
This bird is given variously as Cyanoptila cyanomelaena, Ficedula cyar
melana or Muscicapa cyanomelana depending on the source docume
chosen and, as he rightly points out, no authoritative list exists. This
of little or no use to the aviculturist who may be unaware of the differe
scientific 'aliases' a bird may have, and also is of limited value if he dc
not have access to a comprehensive library.
Other examples abound: for instance the Zebra Finch Poephila guttc
is still often quoted as Taeniopygia castanotis and occasionally asAmadi
castanotis and thus even for species as common and easily identified as t
Zebra Finch there still appears to be some confusion. To add to this, tin
is the fact that there has been a great increase in the number of cole
mutations, etc., available in a number of species in the past few years.
May I suggest that we consider quoting the naming authority afi
scientific names where there is a possibility of a duality or multiplici
of names. Further, ought we to take a leaf out of the horticulturist's bo
and describe mutations, etc. by a variety name? This extension need r
necessarily be of a Greek or Latin root but simply an accepted mutati
name.

VICTORIA HORSWELL - AN APPRECIATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9174179" page_id="58074908"  page_num="49" year="" vol="">
|
Members will have been very saddened to learn of the death of Victoria
ig) Horswell, from cancer on 21st February 1989, at the tragically
ung age of 37. The President sent a wreath to the funeral on behalf of
members of the Avicultural Society.
&amp;apos; From 1971, when her father became Honorary Secretary and Treasurer
the Society, Victoria was always a very willing and helpful supporter,
e was in charge of the catering at every social meeting and took great
mble with the suppers at Burlington House and Sladmore Gallery in
ndon, and in recent years the buffet lunches held at Ascot and then
rtley Wintney. Members who attended any of these events will remem-
- her cheerful smile and friendly welcome. Probably less known to
ist members was Victoria's role in the day-to-day running of the Soc-
y, such as helping to pack and deliver all the Magazines to the Post
fice, making frequent trips to the bank to pay in subscriptions and
tnerous other tasks.
In her own life, Victoria was well known in the horse world. In her
ns, with her sister and two brothers, she won the national junior and
h senior Pony Club Polo Tournament and later organised her father's
l h goal Sladmore Team. In more recent years she ran the large Pony
ib Tournament at Windsor and taught pony clubs as well as hosting
ur camps.
Victoria was also recognised internationally as a leading expert on
mal sculpture, particularly that of the French 19th century Animalier
ists. Her own passion was for bird bronzes and she gathered a very
e collection of these which she showed to members at a meeting some
irs ago.
I am sure I speak for all members of the Society, in offering our deep-
sympathy to the Horswell family in their great loss.
Professor J.R. Hodges, Chairman of Council.

A very successful spring social meeting was held on Saturday, 18t
March, at the Society's headquarters at Hartley Wintney. Over 60 men
bers and their guests met for a buffet lunch and then listened to a mos
enjoyable talk given by Professor J.R. Hodges, Chairman of the Avicultun
Society Council, entitled 'Further Avicultural Reminiscences'. By populs
request Professor Hodges continued the theme which he had talked abou
some years ago at a meeting in London, telling anecdotes and showin
slides of interesting people and birds that he has encountered. Judging b
the enthusiastic reception, it seems likely that Professor Hodges will b
asked to describe 'Even further reminiscences' before long.
The Council meeting, which should have been held before this luncl
was cancelled.

BREEDING AND MANAGEMENT OF FLAMINGOS
AT CHESTER ZOO

(Curator of Birds)
The history of flamingos at Chester Zoo is best documented from
1st January 1962, from which date we have stock books detailing the
birds within the collection. Other records indicate that Caribbean Flam-
ingos Phoenicopterns ruber ruber were received at Chester in 1958, and
Greater Flamingos Phoenicop terns ruber roseus imported from John
Seago in Kenya in September 1957.
Flamingos, then, have been held at Chester Zoo for at least 30 years.
The numbers and species of flamingos kept at Chester are listed in Table 1.
Between 1971 and 1979, Chester held all six species of flamingo, with
Lesser Phoeniconaias minor , Andean Phoenicoparrus andinus and James'
Flamingo Phoenicoparrus famesi in very small numbers. The single Lesser
and Andean Flamingos and the two James' Flamingos were sent to join
the flocks at Slimbridge in 1979, Chester receiving four Caribbean Flam-
ingos in exchange. Subsequently, in 1981, the remaining three Greater
Flamingos were exchanged for two Caribbeans. This left Chester with a
mixed flock of 19 Chilean Phoenicop terns chilensis and nine Caribbean
Flamingos.
Clearly at this stage, with Caribbeans (rather than Chileans) received in
exchange for the species leaving the collection, the path was set for build-
ing up flocks of both the Caribbean and Chilean Flamingos. Thus, when a
flock of Caribbean Flamingos became available in 1984, we decided to
purchase them. More recent acquisitions of Caribbeans from Whipsnade
have come to us on deposit, and Chileans from Harewood Bird Gardens
by way of exchange.

and Duplaix-Hall and Kear (1975).
The previous Curator of Birds, Peter Stevens, initiated a series of
changes, which resulted in our present enclosure. A larger water area was
created, which is shallow at the edges and sufficiently deep in the centre
to allow the birds to mate whilst in the deeper water. The shallower areas
at the edges were where we hoped nest-building would occur. Recent
modifications to this area have included sinking lengths of wood across
one of the bays to form a barrage, then filling this area with extra mud,
and placing artificial concrete nest-mounds in this area.
Two types of artificial nest mounds are provided. These were made by
using a bucket as a mould for one and a shallower wider bowl for the
other. These concrete mounds are positioned in the nesting area with the
wider inverted bowl-type mounds in the shallower water near the edge of
the lagoon and the inverted bucket-type mounds in slightly deeper water
away from the water's edge.

The flamingos are held throughout the year in the same enclosure
(some collections move their birds to separate winter quarters), but are
locked into their heated shelter at night during the winter months. Protec-
tion from foxes is provided by the electrical outer fence, which is activated
at night during the summer months.
The flamingos are fed on a commercially produced, pelleted diet, which
contains 18% protein, but the birds also obtain some natural food from
the water area of the enclosure. In spring and early summer this diet is
replaced with a 'breeding diet', in which the protein level is raised to 35%,
to mimic changes presumed to occur in the wild, with an algal bloom
during the breeding season. The flamingos are less keen on this stronger
mix, and it has to be phased in gradually. Both the standard and breeding
diets contain c an th ax an thin, a substance necessary to produce the bright
orange-pink colour which signals breeding condition in flamingos.
Flock composition and behaviour
The Chester Zoo flock consists of both Chilean and Caribbean Flam-
ingos. At the beginning of the breeding season in April 1987 the flock
comprised ten male, eight female and six unsexed Carribbeans (the latter
were young birds received in 1986 from Whipsnade Zoo) and eight male,
fourteen female and one unsexed Chilean Flamingos. Sex was determined
for different birds by laparoscopy or size differences between the sexes.
Males tend to be larger than females of the same species but there is some
overlap in ranges of measurements of the two sexes. All birds are individ-
ually identifiable by means of darvic leg rings engraved with two-figure or

number combinations. Observation of birds on the nest and those accom-
panying them was aided by the use of a telescope, without which the re-
cording of individual birds' leg rings would have been impossible.
Outside the breeding season both species tend to gather in separate
single-species flocks. Prior to 1987, nests had been built and copulation
observed but no instances of pairing between the two species was noted.
Pair bonding
Table 2 lists the combinations of birds seen consistently together at
nests in 1987. At the majority of nests pairs consisted of birds of the same
species. However, nest 87/1 was occupied by a Chilean female and a Carib-
bean male and although that male was not seen to copulate with the female,
the chick produced from this nest appears to be a hybrid. Another possible
cross-pairing occurred at nest 87/5 where three birds were observed to
share incubation duties. There a female Chilean shared incubation with a
male Chilean and a male Caribbean but this egg failed to hatch. All other
pairings were pure with three pairs and one trio of Chileans (the latter
comprised one male and two females) and a total of six pairs of Carib-
beans.
Long-standing pair bonds are suggested by the pairing combinations
which were apparent in these breeding attempts at Chester. Both part-
ners at nests 87/3 and 87/4 were received together from Birdland in 1969
and may have continued bonds established some 20 years ago. Similarly, at
nests 87/4b, 8a and 9, the pairs were formed from birds all received in
1984 from Mole Hall where they had previously been held for some 18
years.
The newest pair formed was that of the Chilean male AR, hatched at
Harewood Bird Gardens in 1984, and only received at Chester Zoo in
April 1987 with the older female A1222 hatched at Whipsnade in 1980
and received at Chester, in 1982. Studer-Thiersch (1975) noted that new
pairs of flamingos at Basle Zoo would not breed until the following year.
It is of interest to note that female A1222 laid in late July, less than three
months after the arrival of her partner AR.
In 1988 additional data on breeding associations was obtained and this
is listed in Table 3. Of the 12 combinations identified in 1987, 10 were
continued into 1988 including the triadic relationship of the males Chilean
AD and Caribbean FS with the female Chilean AN. Following the death of
the male Chilean AD in June 1988 the Caribbean male FS re-nested with
the Chilean female AN.
After successfully rearing a chick in 1987, it was surprising to find that
the Caribbean female FN and male AT had separated and that AT paired
with the female AF, leaving FN unpaired in 1988. This was the more sur-

prising in that there was a surplus of Caribbean males with which FN could
have nested. The other change of mate involved the Chilean male AB and
female 19, which separated in 1988. The male AB paired with the female
BL (which was associating with the pair in 1988) and the female 19 formed
an association with the Chilean female 01. In the latter case both females
shared the incubation of two eggs, suggesting that each bird had laid in
the shared nest. A second association of two females was that of the
Chileans AJ and 21.
Other new associations in 1988 were the Caribbeans AJ and FU (which
reared a chick), the Chileans 13 and 11, and the hybrid association of the
Caribbean male FX and Chilean female 23.
Age of breeding birds
The Chilean females A1222 and 19 were seven years old on their first
breeding attempts. Four other Chilean females AV, AL, AN and 26 were
received as adults from Birdland in 1969, and BL was received earlier in
1966. These five birds were then at least 20 years old when they laid their
first eggs at Chester. The Caribbean female FT which laid for the first time
at Chester in 1987 and successfully reared her chick, was obtained as an
adult from Chicago Zoo in April 1959. She was at least 29 years old on
this her first breeding attempt at Chester Zoo.
Copulation
Copulations from July to September 1987 were, with the notable
exception of one pair, infrequent. Mating behaviour was preceded by the
pair separating from the rest of the flock and wading out into deep water
with the male closely following the female. When receptive, the female
stops and stands in deep water allowing the male to climb on her back
and achieve mating.
In 1987 no copulations were seen that involved mixed matings of
Caribbeans and Chileans although these were presumed to have occurred
between the mixed pair at nest 87/1. One unidentified male Caribbean was
seen to follow a female Chilean but copulation did not follow. However,
in 1988 Chilean 26 was mated by Caribbean AX. Following the death of
the Chilean male AD the Caribbean male FS was observed mating the
Chilean female AN.
In 1987 the Caribbean male AI was particularly insistent on mating
with his partner FP when she left the nest, and would follow her into the
water to copulate. This left their nest unguarded. This behaviour con-
tinued until less than a week before their egg hatched and appeared non-
adaptive in that the cost of egg-loss would appear to be great compared to
that ol possible cuckoldry at this late stage in the breeding cycle.

Copulation outside established pairs was attempted; for example, by
the Chilean male AA which frequently fohowed, and on several occasions
attempted to mate, the female A1222 in both 1987 and 1988. However,
none of his witnessed attempts at promiscuous mating were successful.
Nesting
Nests were built from mud, on top of the artificial nest mounds pro-
vided and also on the bare ground near the edge of the lagoon or, in
several instances, at some distance from the water. Where reeds and other
vegetation were incorporated into the nest mound then this made the nest
more substantial than those built with mud alone. Ah four wider bowl-
type concrete nest mounds were used as a basis for the building of nests.
None of the bucket-type mounds were used.
In previous years, nests had been built within the lagoon area created
for nesting and provided with artificial concrete nest bases and also on
one of the islands. Indeed, the island site had been specially favoured by
the flamingos. In 1987, although some nest-building occurred on the island,
all occupied nests were build in and around the lagoon area. As previously
noted, some were built on to the concrete bases and others straight on to
the bare earth or within a flattened nettle patch.
Nest 87/10, built by a pair of Caribbeans and from which a chick
hatched but failed to survive, was built some distance from the other
nests on bare ground close to the feeding area. Other nests were clumped
close together. There was no evidence of Chileans and Caribbeans choosing
separate areas for nesting; the two species behaved as a single colony.
Occupation of nest sites was studied from the hatching of the first chick
on 6th July 1987. Nest site 87/8, first used by a pair of Caribbeans and
deserted after their egg was found broken, was then used for two nest
attempts by the Chileans AB and 19. This suggests that this nest site was
particularly attractive to the flamingos. If so, the series of egg losses at this
nest may be explained by competition for this nesting area. The period of
only three days between the loss of the second egg and laying of the third
at this nest may suggest that two different females were involved. Chilean
female BL was observed sitting on this nest the day before the appearance
of the third egg and although she subsequently rarely incubated, this may
have been because of the dominance of the female 19 in this trio.
In 1988 the earliest nests were built in the lagoon area favoured the
previous year. One pair of Caribbeans nested away from the other birds
and close to the feeding area. This nest, 88/8, was built at the same site as
87/10 by the same pair of Caribbean Flamingos, FP and AI,that used this
site in 1987. Additionally, one pair of Caribbeans and one pair of Chileans
built nests on the island.

Following the desertion of the lagoon nest sites and of nest 88/8
following a predator incident in June 1988, the island then became the
focus of later nesting activities for all but one pair of flamingos. That
pair, Caribbeans AJ and FU, occupied nest 88/8 deserted by FO and AI.
Perhaps because of the nest's isolation, AJ and FU were rather incon-
sistent sitters leaving their egg unbrooded for lengthy periods. All the
other flamingos nested together on the island with perhaps more clump-
ing of Chilean nests than had been noticeable in 1987.
Incubation
Incubation was by both sexes and incubating birds remained on the
nest for long periods. Changeovers were infrequent and the identity of
incubating birds could only be established at changeover or when they
stood up to inspect the egg below them. The best time to watch the birds
was at feeding time when the general excitement of the flock would
result in the incubating birds rising off the nest to get a better view of
what was happening around them.
The numbers of times individual birds were identified incubating at
different nests are recorded in Tables 2 and 3. Within different pairs
(and trios) there was variation in the degree to which incubation duties
were shared but on average, males appeared to take an equal role to
females. In those pairs in which males were observed incubating more
frequently than females, it was noticed that the males were most often
seen incubating towards the end of the incubation period rather than
during the first few weeks of incubation.
Hatching and care of young
The normal incubation period quoted for flamingoes is 27-31 days
with hatching taking 24-36 hours (Studer-Thiersch, 1975). We were able
to determine the incubation period at three nests in 1988. At one nest
this was calculated to be between 27 and 29 days, at another a mini-
mum of 32 days and at a third to be 37 days. In the latter case, the
parents AJ and FU spent long periods off the nest, to the extent that
our concern led us to remove the egg to an incubator, substituting an
infertile egg in its place. This substitution was made 20 days after the egg
was laid. Candling showed that the egg was developing normally although
it had not reached the stage that would have been expected for three-
quarters through incubation. The egg was left in the incubator for a
further eight days then returned to the nest where it hatched nine days
later. We assume that the parents' lengthy periods off the egg led to its
cooling and slowed its development.
The chicks remained on the nest for the first few days being brooded

by either parent and later positioning themselves in the space between the
body and wing of the brooding adult. The first chick to hatch in 1987 left
the nest at four days old and returned to be brooded on the nest the
following day. It was then rarely seen near the nest but was brooded by its
parents in other areas of the enclosure. The chick hatched on 27th July
1987, did not leave its nest until seven days old and returned to be brooded
on the nest more frequently. It was last seen being brooded by its mother
on the nest on 17th August when about three weeks old. The third surviv-
ing chick of 1987, hatched on 4th August, briefly left the nest on 10th
August but continued to return to the nest site, last being seen to be fed
on the nest by its father on 19th August.
Feeding by both parents of the rapidly growing chicks continued
through the summer and autumn. The Caribbean chick hatched in early
July 1987 was still being occasionally fed in November, and the chick
hatched in August was seen being fed in February of the following year.
Adults feeding young lost much of their pink coloration, the carotenoid
pigments colour the crop-food secretion red and apparently robbing that
to their growing feathers (Ogilvie and Ogilvie, 1986). This loss of colour
occurred for all six successful parents and served to confirm that the
Caribbean male FX was providing food to its presumed hybrid young.
Factors initiating breeding
Why did the flamingos breed at Chester in 1987 and not in earlier
years? I believe a combination of factors was involved. The enclosure had
been well designed and allowed the birds both deep water for mating and
shallow areas for nesting: minor improvements here were unlikely to have
had great effect on breeding potential. The birds were being fed an ade-
quate diet, and the level of protein had been pumped up prior to breeding.
Spring was particularly wet, and this may have provided the best conditions
for stimulating breeding. The nesting area was left undisturbed and grass
was not cut within the enclosure. All the above factors could have helped,
but my personal opinion is that the balance was tipped in favour of breed-
ing, with the acquisition of the flock of Caribbeans in 1984. These birds,
which had previously nested and laid eggs (but not hatched young) at Mole
Hall, initiated the breeding at Chester. The first two pairs to lay eggs
in June 1987 comprised individuals from Mole Hall which had in all prob-
ability continued already established pair bonds. We suspect, but cannot
be sure, that these were the individuals which had previously laid at Mole
Hall. Anyway, the following events surprised us all, for another 10 pairs
of flamingos followed their example and nested and laid eggs in 1987.

Our immediate problem is with avoiding any further hybridisation.
Many hours have been spent watching the flock to obtain the information
noted above. As long as we maintain Chilean and Caribbean Flamingos in
the same exhibit, we must continue to monitor closely their family life.
Where hybrid pairs occur, our policy must be, as it was in 1988, to inter-
fere by removing those eggs and replacing them with wooden dummies in
order to discourage these birds from re-laying. At present our flock struc-
ture is such that we have more male than female Caribbeans and vice versa
with the Chileans. This situation has predisposed our group towards hy-
bridisation. It is noteworthy that Caribbean males paired with Chilean
females, and not vice versa, and that with the 1987 trios, the supernumary
birds were a Caribbean male in one case and a Chilean female in the other.
Also in 1988 both homosexual associations were between supernumary
Chilean females.
Although we can hopefully correct our present sex imbalance (this is
difficult in that Caribbean males appear to be easier to find than females)
and guard against hybrid pair bonds, we will never be certain that out-of-
pair mating does not occur. Accordingly our long-term policy must be to
have only single-species flamingo exhibits and a new enclosure is planned
for the Chilean flock.

BREEDING AND BREEDING BEHAVIOUR OF
DOUBLE-BANDED SANDGROUSE
Pterocles bicinctus

Introduction
The Sandgrouse form a distinct group of desert-dwelling birds, usually
now classified as a separate order (Cramp and Simmonds, 1985). They are
superficially pigeon-like with compact bodies, small heads and short legs.
Flight is direct and powerful and flight calls, especially frequent on trips to
and from water, are an excellent guide to identification. Their distribution
is largely Afro-Asian with only two species occurring in southern Europe.
They are chiefly granivorous but a variety of green plant material is also
taken by some species.
Habitat
The species discussed in this article is the Double-banded Sandgrouse
Pterocles bicinctus from southern Africa. Its range extends from Namibia
and Angola in the west to Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique in the
east. Their habitat is varied, ranging from wooded savanna and dry grass-
land through to very arid rocky and gravelly areas with tussock grass and
scmb.
Description
The Double-banded is one of the smaller species of sandgrouse, weigh-
ing around 200 grams. The male has a grey/buff face, neck and chest with
a black and white chestband. The forehead has transverse black and white
stripes and the crown is streaked brown. The belly, back, rump, tail
coverts and short tail are closely barred with dark brownish grey and
brown with many feathers tipped white. The mantle, scapulars and wing
coverts are largely grey washed with buff and pale olive, with soft brown
bars and conspicuous white spots. The primaries and secondaries are dark
brown to black and the wing linings dark grey. The tips of the wings are
usually carried tucked beneath the sides of the tail. The legs, of which the
tarsi are feathered in grey on the front, feet and bare skin around the eyes
are yellow and the bill orange. The eye is large (in the wild, Double-banded
Sandgrouse are chiefly crepuscular and drink after dark) and dark brown.
The female is mottled brown with barring and spotting in grey and
white. The white spots are particularly concentrated on the tips of the

mantle feathers, scapulars and coverts. The belly, tail, tail coverts and
back are similar to the male but more rufous and the wing linings are
again grey. The bare parts are also similar to the male but less bright
and with the bill dark tipped. A full description is given in Urban, Fry
and Keith (1986).
Origin of birds
In 1984, a group of Double-banded Sandgrouse were imported under
licence from Namibia as wild-caught adults. We first became involved with
them in August 1985.
Housing
The birds, seven males, two females and one juvenile female, are
housed in an aviary inside a greenhouse. The aviary is shared with five
pairs of Pin-tailed Sandgrouse P. alchata. Originally, the two species were
kept separately but since August 1988 they have lived as one flock with
no difficulties. The aviary, measuring 12 x 6 x 2m, is constructed of a soft
nylon mesh held under tension by a string framework with the bottoms
of the walls buried in the ground. The birds are thus free to fly without
suffering any damage. The floor is of earth, varying from hard-packed to
soft and is renewed yearly. Some vegetation is encouraged to provide
shade and hiding places. The greenhouse successfully produces high,
desert-like temperatures on any sunny day but we were initially concerned
about the high humidity. However, to date this has had no apparent ill
effects. Heat lamps (a mixture of 150w spot lamps and 250w infra-red
lamps) are provided in the winter from approximately October to April
depending on the weather conditions. Although the birds appear to
'enjoy' the lamps, frequently preening and dusting beneath them, they do
not seem to be strictly necessary since some birds will commonly roost
well away from them even with night temperatures as low as 0-5*C. The
lamps also rapidly detect any individuals who are 'off-colour', these birds
spending much more time than usual underneath one. To date, all such
birds have returned to normal after a few days of this self-administered
heat treatment.
Diet
The birds are fed a mixture consisting of three parts mixed millets, two
parts chick crumbs, two parts red milo, two parts groats, two parts whole
hemp and one part linseed. Approximately twice a week they are also
given Haith's 'Quail Mix' and cut maize and, less frequently, lentils. In the
breeding season, Haith's 'Rearing and Condition Food' is provided (fed
dry). The birds do not appear to eat any green or insect food; mealworms

offered to laying females were ignored. They are fed every other day, most
of the seed being placed on trays at six sites around the aviary and with
the remainder just scattered on the ground. A soluble vitamin supplement,
Antec 'Multi-vitamin Extra', is added to their water for three days every
two weeks. Grit, crushed oystershell, cuttlefish and salt/mineral blocks are
freely available at all times.
Before October 1987, the birds were given a powdered vitamin supple-
ment (dusted on to their seed) and the diet did not include chick crumbs.
Up to this date, all embryos died during the last third of incubation, some
apparently ready to hatch. We suspected that an undetected vitamin def-
iciency in the adults was proving lethal to the embryos and hence changed
the diet to that described above. Since this change, four out of five fertile
eggs incubated by the birds have hatched successfully. The failure of the
eggs incubated artificially was thought to be due to poor incubation tech-
nique compounded by problems of having eggs of different ages in the
same incubator.
Breeding season
A summary of their breeding attempts is given in Table 1. The onset of
laying has occurred earlier each year so far, the earliest egg to date being
laid on 1st January 1988. The comparatively late start in 1986 could
have been influenced by the birds' need to settle in to the aviary. Mid-
winter seems an odd time to begin breeding and does not tally with the
breeding season for their natural habitat either, this being April to October,
particularly May to July, and some also in November and December
(Urban, Fry and Keith, 1986).
Sexual behaviour
The birds become noticeably sexually active from about November
onwards. Monogamy is the rule and males will defend their females aggres-
sively. However, both sexes will sometimes indulge in extra-pair activity
and one of our established pairs has formed a trio with a non-breeding
male. This bird, male M, joined them in rearing a fostered brood of Pin-
tailed Sandgrouse chicks and is currently helping with the incubation of
their fourth 1988 clutch.
At least seven complete copulations have been observed and in all
cases involved an interesting post-copulatory display. Proceedings begin
with the male displaying to the female. The wings are held away from the
body but still closed, the tail is held down almost vertically, touching the
ground, and the head is retracted and also held down with the bill pointing
at the ground. The bird moves with a stiff, slow gait and exaggerated
stepping, usually within l-3m of the female, and whilst walking, often

in a small circle or on the spot, pecks at the ground. This pecking is the
same action as performed by an adult 'feeding' a chick (see later), i.e.
items are repeatedly picked up and dropped. An interested female will
approach the male, sometimes very rapidly or even with a short, flap-
ping flight, and join him in pecking at the same spot. She may then crouch
down at that spot or walk away a few steps and crouch. The pecking
together can be omitted with the female simply running or flying close to
the male and crouching. The male walks around behind her, with a more
normal but tense body posture and a very deliberate, slow gait and
mounts. Copulation lasts about 15-20 seconds. As it proceeds, the male
slowly opens his wings until, at the time he dismounts over the female's
head, they are fully spread laterally. After dismounting, he runs a short
distance and then stands very erect, with legs stretched and chest out and
his wings held out sideways, fully open, displaying the dark grey wing
linings. We have called this posture the 'heraldic display'. It can be held for
10-30 seconds before he slowly relaxes, closes his wings and resumes a
normal standing posture. The female appears to pay no attention after the
male dismounts, usually being occupied in preening or having wandered
off to feed.
One of us (S.A.H.) has seen copulations in three species of sandgrouse
(Black-bellied P. orientalis, Pin-tailed and Spotted P. senegallus) in the
wild and in none of them was there any kind of post-copulatory display.
It is possible that it is an artefact of captivity but in one reverse copu-
lation, it was performed by the female. The bird concerned, female Y,
started to lay again when her surviving chick was nearly four weeks old
(see Table 1). In an effort to get these eggs fertilised, she was given access
to male S/Y with whom she had previously paired but who had lost her
in a fight to male Y. The female was very keen to copulate and solicited
the male repeatedly, running and flying up to him and crouching. He did
not respond beyond a rather half-hearted initial displaying and eventually
she mounted him. On two of these occasions, the male seemed terrified
and did not co-operate but the third time, it appeared to be a normal
copulation except with the positions reversed and the dismounting female
performing the heraldic display. About 20 minutes after this, the male
attempted copulation but fell off sideways. A repeated attempt a little
later looked normal and successful and ended with the male giving the
display. However, despite further matings on other days, the subsequent
eggs were addled.
Nest and eggs
The nest consists of a shallow scrape about 120mm across. It is exca-
vated by the bird resting on its breast and kicking soil out behind whilst

rotating in a circle. Both sexes do this but it is usually started by the male
who may then be joined by the female. The nest is unlined in the conven-
tional sense but it may contain, and have scattered around it,feathers, bits
of dry vegetation, small stones and shells. Several scrapes may be initiated
by the male, one of which the female then selects for laying. In 1986 and
1987, eggs were laid at 24 and 48 hour intervals but in the last season both
females have settled to a 48 hour interval. Clutch size can be two or three
eggs, the earlier ones usually being three. The eggs measure 34.0 x 25.4mm
range 30.0-36.8 x 24.0-28.0mm (n = 18). They are more or less eliptical.
Ground colour varies from white through very pale buff and orange to
pink. This is marked with brown and grey spots and streaks, often more
concentrated at one end than the other. A few eggs have extensive scribble
marks giving a marbled appearance.
Nest defence
The nest site is defended against approaching 'strange' birds from a
distance of approximately 2m. Females are more aggressive in this be-
haviour than males, first issuing a warning chucking noise which increases
to a gutteral churr , followed by a chase and attempts to peck the intruder
if the warning is unheeded. The nest defence behaviour becomes more
intense as incubation proceeds. Both sexes perform an aggressive display to
human approach when still on the nest, of fluffing up the plumage, raising
a wing and making short, rapid turning movements, whilst chucking and
churring continuously. As with a trespassing bird, persistent intrusion can
elicit pecking, with the bird even running or flying at the offending hand.
If they leave the nest, they may perform a distraction display, crouching
low, dragging a wing and/or tail and perhaps flapping the wings as if unable
to fly whilst running an erratic course and churring.
Incubation
Incubation begins with the laying of the last egg. The pair are attentive
to the nest during laying and sometimes one or the other will sit on the
eggs for a few minutes at a time. Much time is also spent sitting beside the
eggs. In hot weather, they tend to sit on the eggs for much longer periods
but are not thought to be incubating. It is possible that this prevents the
eggs being over-heated or at least being warmed sufficiently to begin devel-
opment before the clutch is complete. On one occasion, although protec-
ted from the weather by the greenhouse, female 0 was seen to walk to her
nest and stand over the eggs during a brief but very heavy shower of rain.
For both female 0's 1988 clutches, incubation changeovers have been
seen at about 08.30 and 16.00h, with the male sitting during the day. This
is the reverse of observations of other sandgrouse species in the wild

(Cramp and Simmonds, 1985, pers. obs.). For previous clutches, she has
been observed sitting during the day and at night. It seems likely that
this behaviour is highly atypical and produced by the environment of
the aviary. Similarly strange, female Y appeared to do the majority of
the incubation of her second 1988 clutch. The male spent most of his
time sitting beside her, side-stepping on to the eggs when she moved
off to feed and sidling off again when she returned. Her second mate of
1988, male S/Y, was never seen to incubate his first clutch but spent a
week sitting on a piece of cuttlefish apparently mistaking it for an egg.
For his second clutch, he incubated with such enthusiasm that the female
had difficulty in getting him to leave the eggs when she wished to take
over. In previous years, female Y consorted with several males, chiefly
male Y and male S/Y, and laid eggs fairly haphazardly around the aviary.
Those eggs placed in a reasonable scrape but which she attended only
sporadically, were deliberately holed by pecking by female 0 whose nest
was about 1.5m away.
Incubation under the birds lasted 23 and 24 days, counting day 1 as
the day after the laying of the last egg, and hatching is synchronous.
Chick rearing
The young are precocial, becoming mobile as soon as they are dry
and are well described in Urban, Fry and Keith (1986). Briefly, they are
patterned above with brown patches outlined and marked with black,
separated by white lines, and white beneath. The overall effect provides
superb camouflage. When small, the chicks sit down and 'freeze' in res-
ponse to the adults' alarm calls (chucking and churring) and can give an
observer the impression that they have suddenly disappeared.
They are fed a mixture consisting of three parts chick crumbs, two
parts red lentils, two parts green lentils, two parts Haith's 'Rearing and
Condition Food', one part hemp seed and one part linseed. All these,
except the rearing food, are finely ground in a blender before mixing
them together. As they grow, the food is less finely ground and whole
seed is gradually introduced, starting with millet. At about two months
old, the chicks are eating the adult diet but supplemented with lentils
and rearing food. They are given soluble vitamins in their water every
other day for the first two weeks after which the frequency is gradually
reduced to reach the adult rate at about two months old..
Sandgrouse are probably most well known for the way in which the
male carries water to the young in specially modified belly feathers (Cade
and Maclean, 1967). For the first pair to hatch chicks, we provided water
in a metal tray with sides 4.5 cm high, in addition to a shallow bowl for
drinking. The intention was for the male to be able to step into the tray

for belly soaking whilst preventing the chicks from getting in. This failed
miserably on both counts; the male was put off and one of the chicks
drowned. The other pair were given a gravel-filled tray with a sloping
access point making it easy for adults and chicks to get in and out. This
worked well and the male concerned, male P, belly-soaked until the
chick was five weeks old. Unfortunately, we were unable to watch the
watering behaviour as it occurred after dark. Whether or not the chick
obtained its water from the male for the whole of the five weeks is also
unknown but it seems unlikely that it had not learned to drink for itself
prior to this. Female Y responded to her chick pushing against her flanks
(for reasons not related to drinking) by belly-soaking weeks after it had
learned to drink and indeed, it was never seen to take water from her.
When necessary, we give young chicks water in soaked cotton wool,
into which they push their beaks enthusiastically. After a few days, they
can be persuaded to take water from wet cotton wool in a dish by gently

pushing their heads down into it. Their natural tendency is to reach up
since a male's wet belly would be above them. Just-dried chicks respond
to a touch or nearby movement by stretching up and making searching
movements with the head and bill whilst calling continuously. The cotton
wool in a dish can be dispensed with once the chicks are drinking regu-
larly for themselves. Chicks being watered by hand, but otherwise reared
by their parents, will run calling to a human offering wet cotton wool.
Having learned to drink for themselves, they run and hide from a human
approach.
A major difficulty in maintaining the young chicks lay in keeping
them warm enough in an unheated greenhouse in February. This was
exacerbated by the behaviour of the adults who, although attentive
parents, were content to brood one or two chicks whilst the remainder
were getting cold a few feet away. With the clutch hatched by female Y,
we confined them to a small section of the aviary, approximately 2 x 3m
and provided two lamps, one infra-red and one spot lamp. This appeared
to be working until one chick, at nine days old, was found dead, apparent-
ly chilled, in a sleeping posture about 0.5m from one of the lamps. After
this, the whole small section was enclosed in polythene, with a vent in the
roof to prevent overheating, and provided with a fan heater with the
thermostat set at 25*C. This worked well and the same method was
applied to the pair who subsequently reared their single chick to inde-
pendence. This pair was enclosed in a polythene 'tent', 2 x 2 x lm, with
one infra-red lamp and a fan heater, the day after the chick hatched. We
were concerned that such major interference might cause the adults to
desert the chick, but, although they were highly nervous for several days
and sometimes had to be returned to the tent after flying out through
the vent, they reared the chick with no further interference from us. At
four weeks old the chick flew out through the vent and circled the aviary,
flying strongly. It is highly likely that chicks can fly short distances at
three weeks and probably have some flight before this. After one month,
the family group were given access to a small section of the aviary in
addition to the tent and returned to the main section with the non-breed-
ers ten days later.
At three months old, the chick had a pale, dusty-looking version of
female plumage but with fewer white spots on the back and more barring.
Between three and six months old, it moulted completely into an adult-
type female plumage but still with less spotting. We were delighted that
it turned out to be female and feel sure that our unpaired males, one
of whom is already showing an interest, would agree.
It is not possible to define a clear-cut age of independence . Young
sandgrouse remain associated with one or both parents for several months

and quite possibly until the next breeding season. The chick remained with
the adults whilst they tended their third clutch, often sitting beside the
incubating parent, and joined them in 'feeding' (see later) a fostered brood
of Pin-tailed Sandgrouse. She has shown no interest in their fourth clutch
but still associates with the 'off-duty' parent, especially the female.
The chick which died at two months appeared to have some kind of
developmental problem. At death, it looked like an oversized two-week
old with a sparse covering of body feathers and stunted wing and tail
feathers. Ten days previously it had been prescribed antibiotic for infec-
tion of some of the primary follicles and vitamin B12 to promote feather
growth. Both treatments had worked well and the chick had begun a rapid
growth of feathers when it died. The problem may have arisen from some
kind of nutritional deficiency although its diet was the same as for the
successful chick. It is also possible that the cold conditions prior to the
introduction of the tent and fan heater had somehow disrupted normal
development.
As is usual with precocial young, the chicks are self-feeding, but also
receive encouragement to feed, and some actual food items from the
parents. In the latter process, the adult picks up, for example, a seed and
drops it in front of the chick who will, in turn, try to pick it up and
swallow it. If the chick drops it, the adult may repeat the process with
the same seed several times until it is finally eaten or eventually abandon
it and try something else. When two or three chicks are feeding with one
adult, they all peck in the area around the adult's bill, so provided that
there are several seeds in one spot, they should all get something to eat.
The adults do not necessarily select items that are small enough for chicks
to handle or that are even edible. Also, chicks often feed in the parents'
vicinity but ignore the items dropped by them, so we suspect that the
main purpose is to encourage the young to peck rather than to feed them
specific items. However, an element of learning what and what not to eat
could well be involved. The chick hatched in the incubator that died at
six days old was never very strong but the lack of stimulation to feed was
probably a major contributor to its early death.
One aspect of the chicks' behaviour which seems strange in comparison
to another species of which we have experience, the Pin-tailed Sandgrouse,
is their quietness. Even when distressed, a chick can only be heard from a
few yards away and when hatching, they can be heard scraping at the egg
shell but not calling. In contrast, Pin-tailed Sandgrouse chicks can be heard
in the egg inside the incubator from the far side of the room, and when
hatched, from down a corridor through a closed door. In general, the Pin-
tailed chicks are much more vigorous and robust than the fragile and
delicate-seeming Double-banded chicks so perhaps we still have some way

to go in finding the right diet and conditions for these very beautiful birds;
any suggestions welcomed. As far as we are aware, this is the first breeding
of this species in Britain.
As subjects for aviculture, sandgrouse are to be highly recommended.
As seed eaters, they are relatively easy to feed, they cheerfully tolerate
temperatures from 0*C to 45*C, they appear to be robust and resistant to
disease and parasites, they are long lived, will breed in captivity, have few
if any excessively bad habits, become tame and friendly if treated kindly
and all have their own, highly individual personalities.

As described above, the Double-banded Sandgrouse Pterocles bicinctus has been
bred by S.A. Hinsley and D.J. Hockey in 1988, and this is believed to be the first
success in this country. Anyone knowing of a previous breeding in Great Britain or
Northern Ireland, or of any other reason that would disqualify this claim, is asked to

THE HAND-REARING OF A VOSMAER'S ECLECTUS
PARROT Eclectus roratus vosmaeri
By DULCIE COOKE
</sectionHeader>

(Epsom, Surrey)
There is something particularly romantic about Eclectus Parrots; per-
haps it is their name, so near to eclectic, meaning to choose the best of
various subjects. To their owners, Eclectus simply are the best! The
intensity of their colours, their dignified manners and great intelligence,
plus in many cases their outstanding ability to talk, endear them to all
who know and understand them. Some of them are exceptionally clever
at making very sound common sense and comment on the situation of the
moment; once they have acquired a reasonable vocabulary. Their own
'language' is exceptionally extensive and expressive.
Their dignified stoicism in face of adversity is a trait in their personality
which those who know and love them have to admire. I well remember
seeing a pair of these magnificent birds housed in a very large aviary-cage
in light, airy and immaculately clean conditions in a large and well run
commercial establishment selling birds. The hen was considerably plucked,
where she had obviously taken her own feathers to line her nest; the cock
had the slightly 'worn' look of a father of many young. They were other-
wise in perfect condition. My husband Freddie and I wished we could have
given the aviary space for another pair. These birds knew by instinct that
we understood them; they had known happier times, and I shall never
forget the silent pleading in their eyes. They wanted to be treated as indi-
viduals, to be given names and to have their home.
Joseph Forshaw, in his Parrots of the World , gives details of Eclectus
roratus , the Red-sided, and ten subspecies of which only E. roratus roratus
known as the Grand, and E.r. vosmaeri are usually available in the U.K.;
although some of the rarer subspecies are no doubt resident here in various
collections.
These beautiful birds mainly inhabit New Guinea, and many of the
islands, including the Solomon Islands, in that part of the world, also
parts of the Cape York Peninsula of North-Eastern Australia.
One of the outstanding features of these birds is their extremely
obvious sexual dimorphism. The cocks of all species of Eclectus are rather
similar, a predominantly rich green, with massive under-wing areas of
varying shades of crimson or scarlet, the primary feathers of their huge
wings a deep blue, turquoise to sky blue and crimson on the bend of the
shoulder, tail green above and black below - all set off by the huge orange

and rosy red beak and the large expressive eyes which, in an adult cock,
are a light orange.
Young males have brownish beaks which change colour slowly over
several months, and young females have black beaks. The hens of the
various subspecies are in some cases easier to identify. The Red-sided
Eclectus E. roratus polychloros is of a somewhat subdued shade of dark
red, with blue to purple on parts of her front. It is she who has the distinc-
tive blue eye ring. The Grand E. roratus roratus is also of a rather dark red
and purple, but with a tail tipped with gold.
In E.r. vosmaeri, which is the third subspecies usually available in the
U.K., the red of the hen, especially a young hen before she starts to
breed, is of such a rich and dazzling hue as to be quite startling. Her
wholly purple lower breast and underparts are of exceptional intensity
of colour, and to adorn all this beauty still further, her bright red tail has
a huge band of deep gold.

Eclectus hens have black beaks, even as babies, and the eyes are a
paler shade of orange than the cocks, in some cases no more than yellow.
When excited their eyes can appear very large and almost white.
The weight of males can be 15-20oz (450-600g); the females can be
heavier at about 16-21oz (475-625g). The average length is about 13-Min
(33-35cm).
These birds enjoy sunflower seeds and pine nuts but the latter should
be treated with caution as, though they can often be shiny and perfect on
the outside, the inside may be absolutely useless, just green-grey dust.Ec-
lectus are very fond of peanuts (groundnuts, monkey nuts) but these are
best fed as kernels, cooked with soaked pulses for one minute. Few birds
are greater gourmets than Eclectus, their normal diet, which is fed fresh
twice per day, consisting of a bowl of about a level tablespoon of brown
bread and milk, squeezed out and crumbled, and a large tablespoon of
mixed pulses which have been soaked overnight, then boiled for one min-
ute. to which have been added a few peanut kernels. Once per day, about
half a yolk of hard-boiled egg is added.
To the above basic mixture a whole range of food is added, such as
well washed and cut up grapes, peeled and cored sweet apple cut up,
pear, and when in season pieces of pomegranate. Orange and grapefruit
are never given; these fruits do not appear to agree with Eclectus. Avocado
pear is never given to the birds; although it has been said that it is only
the skin which is so poisonous to parrots, we prefer to be safe rather
than sorry.
Our soft food bowl often contains a few sultanas, or raisins, also
shelled walnut pieces and shelled Brazil nuts, cut up, plus shelled almonds
and hazel nuts. Needless to say, these foods are not all given together but
rather as little extras. Sugared pieces of strawberries and raspberries are
enjoyed too, but a special favourite is a small piece of digestive biscuit,
also little bits of cheddar cheese. Some Eclectus like prawns very much,
but we stopped giving them when they became so very expensive - also
they do attract flies.
It is not always realised that these birds do enjoy a drink of honey
water sometimes (a dessertspoonful of liquid honey to a teacup of boiling
water); when they are breeding the cock seems to appreciate this about
once a week.
In their wild state, Eclectus are high tree dwellers, and tend not to
consider anything that has dropped to the ground to be edible. Once on
the .ground it is dirty, not to be touched. I know of one pair who will not
feed a chick if it should lose its grip and fall to the ground. Perhaps this is

a 'throw-back' to the wild, where obviously a chick must be strong enough
to keep its grip on a perch once Hedged. I have not heard of such beha-
viour from any domesticated Vosmaer's.
One unfortunate thing about Eclectus is that even when they attain
breeding age at between three to five years, they take a long time to
learn how to bring up their young. The mother of the hand-reared bird
who is the subject of this article, first laid at two years old, but the eggs
were not fertile until the cock reached the age of five years. Fortunately
he would go down into the nest of the hen, usually considered very neces-
sary if breeding is to be successful.
During the summer of 1988, our birds' fifth year, the hen laid eight
eggs, in batches of two at a time (a normal clutch). All the eggs were
fertile, all hatched except one, and the hen killed five chicks. We think the
reason may be twofold. Firstly, like many Eclectus hens she had a very
'jagged' lower beak, which is trimmed in the winter but had grown again at
a time when she could not be disturbed. This may have presented great
difficulties for her with tiny, newly-hatched chicks. Secondly, Eclectus
chicks in the egg 'talk' to each other as they develop - we have heard them
in one of our incubators! This may have mislead an inexperienced young
'mother-to-be' to assume that they were ready to hatch and perhaps
needed help, long before this was, in fact, the case. Hence a number of
chicks prematurely 'hatched'. Perhaps she broke the shells open.
Towards the end of the summer I could stand this carnage no longer,
took two eggs away and put them in one of our incubators, with a tem-
perature of 37.5*C and humidity at 50%. They duly talked to each other!
One hatched but died almost immediately; the other, weighing just 17g
when just hatched, was made of tougher material.
'Robbie' had been fed with boiled, luke warm water and glucose while
still in his shell and took this readily from a spoon. Hatching lasted 30
hours during which time I helped him by carefully peeling away small
bits of the rather tough inner membrane, with which he was having diffi-
culty; it was preventing him from turning within the shell. With this small
help, plus the feeds of glucose and water, his hatching was straightforward.
This took place on 10th August 1988, and immediately on freeing himself
of the shell, he was placed in a second incubator which was more suitable
as a first 'brooder'. For those who are interested in incubation it is neces-
sary to state that the yolk sac was fully retracted on hatching; also at this
time his weight was recorded on digital scales. Thereafter he was weighed
before feeding daily for a very long time.
The first real feed came with a tiny quantity of Boot's baby food,
'Mixed Cereal Breakfast' being added to the glucose and boiled water. The
food was of the consistency of very thin, skimmed milk. This was given

about four hours after hatching and thereafter he was fed every two hours,
with the exception of the night, when the last feed was at 12 midnight.
The first feed of the next day was at 3 a.m., then 6 a.m. and back to every
two hours. This went on for the first 12 days, then the 3 a.m. feed was cut
out and the last feed was given at 12.30 a.m. and the next one at 5.30 a.m,
then every three hours round until 12.30 a.m.
For the first ten days the chick was always given a warm, wet finger to
induce normal feeding. All food from the egg onwards was given by means
of a tiny spoon, the average 'feed' being one mouthful. All food was
cooked fresh each time for at least two minutes in a cup standing in
boiling water. The temperature in the brooder was brought down to 34*C
at this stage.
In the early stages the food consisted of three parts Boot's baby food
'Mixed Cereal Breakfast', one part Milupa 'Autumn Fruit Flarvest', half a
part of ground rice, and one-eighth part of Bemax with wheat germ, this
latter amounted to a large 'pinch'. The food was of the consistency of
ordinary milk, or in terms of percentages, about 30% solids and 70%
boiled water.
At ten days old, half a part of oat bran and oat germ (from health food
shops) was added to create more roughage, and the consistency was
somewhat thicker, but after a day or two this was stopped as it did not
seem to suit the chick, and the Bemax wheat germ was increased to a
quarter part.
It was at this time that near-disaster struck in the form of an electricity
cut in our area. Fortunately it was during the day and was noticed quickly.
A hot water bottle wrapped in pieces of blanket saved the little bird. By
this time the Brinsee incubator 'brooder' had to have a wooden extension
on top to raise the heat source for the growing baby.
At 16 days old the heat was reduced to 32.5*C. The food was as
before, but gradually the solid content was increased. Three mouthfuls
of food were given at each feed. Tiny slits appeared in the eyes. At 18
days one eye started to show, and two days later both eyes were little
slits and the young bird seemed able to see dimly.
At 21 days, Cede rearing food was introduced. All seeds were removed
and it was sieved and then pre-soaked for at least three hours in just
enough water to make it completely moist; this caused it to expand con-
siderably. This was only given for two feeds per day and at the rate of
about a quarter of one part to the slightly under five parts comprising the
whole.
After two days' trial, the Cede was given in all but two feeds; by this
time the consistency of the food was brought up to at least 50% solids. At
this stage it is necessary to say that the chick was always surrounded in the

early stages with enough tissues to ensure that his head was kept upright,
and at night he had one or two tissues placed very lightly on top of him, to
simulate a brooding hen. He seemed to like burrowing into these tissues at
night. The boxes which contained him were becoming progressively larger
now.
At 27 days the chick was covered with mid-grey coloured fluff, indica-
ting a male, females having darker fluff. At this time the last feed was at
12 midnight and the first in the morning at 6.15 a.m. At 31 days his eyes
were fully open and he was very lively at feeding times, wanting to play.
When Robbie was about 4 weeks and three days old, the temperaure
was lowered to 31.5*C and feeds were every three and a half hours. He
was taking his first wobbling steps and the beginnings of quills appeared on
top of his head. At this stage, Milupa 'Harvest Muesli' breakfast was added
to his diet at the rate of approximately one part, bringing the whole up to
nearly six part. This muesli seemed to provide him with the roughage he
needed and was very satisfactory. The consistency of the food was that of
fairly thick porridge, 60-70% solids.
At the age of six weeks the young bird had outgrown his original
brooder, and was placed during each day in a large box in a home-made
wooden brooder with the thermostatically controlled heat source coming
from a removable plywood roof which was placed across the top of the
wire-fronted brooder. He was protected from the lights at night with the
aid of another cardboard box, partly cut away to form a 'roof over the
area where he slept, a structure hardly designed to please my Chartered
Engineer husband, but it worked beautifully!
The front part of the brooder box had clean pieces of white paper,
changed twice per day, and laid out with tiny twigs of hazel nut, soaked
and cut up sunflower kernels, cooked garden peas and cooked sweet corn
cut up, grated carrot and tiny bits of lettuce and cress, also very thin, small
slices of cuttlefish 'bone'. Between six and seven weeks old he was being
fed four times a day and it was difficult to get him to eat enough because
he was trying to feed himself.
By the age of two months and a few days, the temperature was brought
down to about 26*C (75*F), and the young bird was allowed to explore
the whole of the very large brooder-cage, only being put back in his inner
box at night, something he very definitely wanted himself; he cried out if
he was not 'put to bed'! At nine weeks old he was walking about the
brooder cage, flapping his wings, and eating quite a lot of food himself. He
knew his name well by this age, always 'answered' when spoken to and
was learning to step on and off the hand when told.
At ten weeks old the young bird was learning to fly and would occa-
sionally say 'hello'. Two weeks later, at three months old, he could fly

quite well, and by three and a half months old he was 'zooming' up and
down stairs, round corners, etc., with incredible ease. His huge wing span
and long body gave an almost hawk-like impression of grace and beauty.
It was at about this time that we transferred Robbie to a medium-sized
parrot cage (0.46 x 0.46 x 0.51m high) with a small 250w electric fire at
night when the house central heating went off. We tried not to let the
temperature go above 70*F or below 60*F. This cage was to be his home
until he reached the age of about ten months, when it would be summer
and he could be transferred to his permanent home, an aviary with a large
flight, a large interlined house with light and some heat for the winter.
For his first winter in an outdoor aviary we shall endeavour to avoid
the temperature going below 50-55*F. His parents, now five and a half
years old, have withstood temperatures as low as 40*F for days on end;
ours is a cold part of South-Eastern England. However, we would not wish
to subject a very young Eclectus and especially any female vosmaeri that
we are lucky enough to obtain for our bird to such low temperatures
during their first winter together.
At the time of writing (April 1989), Robbie is eight months old, talks
extremely well and is rapidly increasing his already considerable vocabu-
lary. The beautiful rich green of his upper wing feathers is attractively
edged with deep blue, a variation from his father's pure green. There is
also some mid-blue edging to the green tail feathers. His beak is now the
rosy orange of an adult bird, but his eyes are still black. When last weighed
about five or six weeks ago, he weighed slightly over 14 oz.
His food now consists of brown bread and milk squeezed out and
crumbled, mixed pulses soaked overnight and then cooked for one minute,
with peanut kernels added just as the water comes to the boil. His soft
food bowl also has sweet apple, which is peeled, cored and cut up, two or
three well washed or peeled grapes cut up, and once per day half a tea-
spoon of hard-boiled egg yolk. This food is given fresh twice per day.
Lettuce, endive or watercress are given once per day, and on alternate days
a piece of celery or carrot. Extras added to the food are cut up shelled
walnuts, brazil nuts, hazel nuts, or almonds, also small pieces of cheddar
cheese, sultanas and raisins.
Naturally a bird living at present in a cage in the house and only let out
twice per day for exercise is bound to be spoilt with 'bits' from the table.
But he has never been given meat, fish or poultry of any kind. He has tried
many cooked vegetables, most fruits, and some buns, cakes, biscuits, etc.
Chocolate is strictly forbidden!
I have found the hand-rearing of this highly intelligent and now beauti-
lul bird one of the most rewarding experiences of my long association
with aviculture. But let no one underestimate the effort involved in

feeding a young bird, day in - day out, nights included. There are now
(thank goodness!) a number of establishments specialising in incubation
and hand-rearing. Robbie's sister from a later clutch was taken as an egg
and handed over to Judith Nicholas of Databird Worldwide. Her superbly
run organisation brought back in due course a lovely young hen, beauti-
fully reared, tame, confident and talking. All credit to Sue Ingles's care
and attention.
Interesting as the experience of rearing Robbie has been, I feel that this
is really a task for the experts, those specialising in this branch of avi-
culture.
We hope very much that Robbie's egg-laying mother will soon learn to
rear her young, but we know now that if she fails in her task, we can hand
over at least some of the eggs to the experts.

tus, a table and graph show the progress of our young cock.

Otus leucotis
By HILARY TYE
(Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire)
On 2nd February 1981, an African White-faced Owl was brought to
the Zoology Department of Fourah Bay College (University of Sierra

Leone), Freetown, Sierra Leone. We photographed the bird (wearing a
gardening glove as a precaution) with the intention of returning it to the
wild immediately. However, the bird appeared unwilling to fly, was very
docile and sat unmoving on the ground. It was easily recaptured and, on
closer examination, was found to have the buffish-brown plumage tones
of juvenile and immature birds (whereas adults are greyer) and lacked the
blacker crown and nape of an adult (Bannerman, 1933). As it seemed
unable to fly, we decided to keep it until it could fend for itself.
Bird trapping is not common in Sierra Leone and the owl was probably
found by chance. If a natural hole in a tree is not available, White-faced
Owls use the old nests of other birds, even small ones of pigeons, sparrows
or waxbills, between 2-8m above the ground, and the young often leave
the nest at about 27 days old and sit on adjacent branches, although they
cannot fly properly until 30-31 days old (Kemp, 1988).
From its plumage and behaviour, this bird was probably about 27-31
days old. It may have fallen from a nest tree or, being outside the nest,
may have been spotted by a passer-by, from whom it could not escape
by Hying. Laying dates for White-faced Owls have been recorded in Sierra
Leone in January and in Nigeria in October and from January to March.
The egg from which this bird came was probably laid at the beginning of
December, as incubation takes about 30 days (Kemp, 1988).
Accommodation
In order to observe its development, the owl was initially kept in our
spacious living room. It spent most of the day on a perch about 1 m above
the ground, the top being a 30cm square of thick wire to which was tied
a platform of split palm petioles (as used for making matting). It was not
necessary to tether the bird as all the windows were covered by security
mesh. Later, when the owl had become a stronger flier it wreaked too
much havoc in the room after we had retired for the night, so it was then
carried on the hand to an empty room in the servant's quarters last thing
at night, to spend the dark hours there.

insects and require about 25g of food daily (excluding indigestible parts),
11-13% of their body weight (Hanmer, 1981). They also hunt at bush
fires during the day, to catch small rodents trying to escape the fire
(Bannerman, 1933). Our closest approximation to wild food, cubes of
raw beef a little over a cubic centimetre in size, were initially ignored
so, after a few hours, they were given to the owl by holding its beak open
and pushing a chunk well in. The bird soon graduated from force-feeding
to voluntarily accepting chunks touched against its beak. A few pieces of
meat (replaced at intervals) were left on the bird's perch but were not
taken for the first few days. About eight to ten such cubes (about 20g)
of lean beef were consumed per day.
We found a similar diet successful with an injured West African Wood
Owl Ciccaba woodfordii, so much so that it managed to escape before
its intended release date!
After about two weeks there appeared a means of varying the owl's
diet and easing our expenses. Large brown beetles (family Scarabaeidae)

about 2.5cm long began flying into our verandah and lit rooms during the
evening and were readily accepted by the bird. At first they were proffered
by hand, then the owl learnt to snatch them live from its perch and, finally,
they were hunted on the floor, having been placed l-2m from the perch.
After another week, geckoes Hemidactylus sp. were introduced into the
hunting training. They were at first held, wriggling, near the perch until
the owl had obviously noticed the movement. Spotting of food was
characterised by a definite head orientation towards the prey, then cir-
cular movements of the head in a vertical plane, presumably to help fix the
position of the prey. This was followed by a sudden dive to the floor
where it grabbed the beetle or lizard in its talons, then pecked with its
beak. Towards the end of March, eight weeks after we received the bird, it
was capable of capturing geckoes released near its perch. These were
herded at first and where necessary, to keep them in range while the owl
peered at them from its perch.
As must be common with young birds learning to feed themselves, mis-
takes were sometimes made. One afternoon, while I was sewing at a table
about 2m away from its perch, the owl suddenly pounced on my twiddling
fingers (but was unsuccessful in its prey capture attempt). Another time,
on 3 1 March, it pounced on a black ball-point pen top and flew with it
back to its perch. The cap had to be gently removed from its beak, as the
bird made no move to drop the object.
Prior to its release in early April, the owl was well able to spot, cap-
ture, dismember and consume live, mobile prey (beetles and geckoes) but
this was still supplemented by raw beef. Apart from the incidents described
above, it did not attempt to explore other potential food sources, although
it 'worried' the cheesecloth curtain adjacent to its perch.
Water was not supplied after the first few days. Spicknall &amp; Pickett
(1983) found that it was not taken by a Striped Owl Rhinoptyrvc clamator
being exploited rather for bathing, as noted also by Oniki (1984) for a
Tropical Screech Owl Otus choliba. Sayers (1981) stated that many owls
are avid bathers and should be given a large container of water, but it
seems unlikely that our owl, during its relatively short period in captivity,
suffered from lack of a bath! We never saw it drink during the first few
days when it was provided with water.
Flight
The owl made no attempt to fly for the first few days, but soon began
to explore the room, walking along the window ledge beside its perch
then flying short distances. Within about a week it could fly more strong-
ly, up to the top of a door, and also climbed the window mesh to the
pelmet. About two weeks after it arrived, we carelessly left the front door

open in the early evening and it flew, low and unsteadily, to a Cassia
tree about 30m away. Since at that stage it could not feed itself or fly
very well, we hurriedly recaptured it with a cloth bag on a long pole
(normally used for picking avocados).
White-faced Owls are predominantly nocturnal and this bird did most
of its flying after dusk, despite the artificial room lighting. It spent most
of the daytime on its perch, inactive, usually with closed eyes, but also
had periods of preening and foraging. When approached, it became alert,
but was tame enough to be picked up on a finger pushed against the
back of its feet.

Vocalisations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994753896551724" page_id="58074956"  page_num="85" year="" vol="">
The call of the adult of the West African subspecies O. 1. leucotis
has been described as &amp;apos;a rather soft kuy-cooo ' (Serle &amp; Morel, 1977)
or 'a disyllabic, mellow, fluting po-proo at 4-8 s intervals' (Kemp, 1988):
this we did not hear. However, the owl sometimes made a slightly rising
then falling purr, uttered at various pitches, and which we tape-recorded.
This sound was sometimes made seemingly to itself, but occasionally
seemed directed towards us. Certain noises also elicited another call:
when an electric food grinder was operated in the next room or voices
raised in its vicinity, it uttered a harsh, rapid (3-4 notes per second),
high-pitched twittering. This was accompanied by a particular posture
in which the bird made itself very tall, thin and stiff, pointing its ear-
tufts and screwing its eyes up. This posture is described by Hanmer &amp;
Hanmer (1980) as being adopted by captive adult White-faced Owls
holding food, when approached by a human. We also occasionally ob-
served it in such circumstances, but Hanmer &amp; Hanmer (1980) found it
accompanied by squeaky growls, which we did not observe. Some wild
White-faced Owls have also been reported as adopting a similar posture
when a car passed nearby at night (Worden &amp; Hall, 1978).
The incidents described by Hanmer &amp; Hanmer (1980) and Worden &amp;
Hall (1978) concerned birds of the race O. /. granti, which occurs in
southern and eastern Africa, as far north as southern Kenya and Uganda.
The vocalisations of O. 1. leucotis , of West and Central Africa, are quite
different from those of granti (Kemp, 1988), which may explain some
of the differences described above. The posture, which perhaps indicates
mild alarm, seems common to both races, and is also adopted by the
Common Scops Owl Otus scops, when approached; the effect in both
species is described as astonishingly concealing in the wild, making the
bird look like a 'rough-barked tree-trunk' (Hanmer &amp; Hanmer, 1980;
Kemp, 1988).

Once the owl could fly reasonably strongly and catch all the prey we
could supply, we decided to release it. It was placed about 3m above the
ground in an avocado tree outside the window where its perch had been
situated. This was done in mid-afternoon and a pot of beef chunks was
fixed to the branch beside it. A few of these were eaten that day, but
none thereafter, although the supply was replenished for a few days.
After two hours in the avocado tree, it flew about 25m to a Spondias
'plum' tree, and sat on a branch about 10m up. One aspect of its train-
ing which we discovered we had neglected was a full introduction to its
fellow animals. While perched in the Spondias it spent some time shaking
first one foot then the other, not realising that the most effective way to
avoid ants is to move elsewhere!
Towards dusk that day, the owl flew away and was not seen again,
though we believe that we heard its call occasionally thereafter and hope
that it stood a fair chance of being able to fend for itself.

Anyone who has managed birds has needed, at various times, to moni-
tor embryonic development in eggs that have been produced by their
birds. Candling is an age-old husbandry technique that entails shining a
bright light into the egg so that the developing embryo can be viewed. Eggs
can be monitored from birds that are incubating their own clutch, or eggs
that have been set in an incubator. In the first case, monitoring develop-
ment is a good tool to observe the progress of the embryo. But only if the
parent birds are calm and tolerant of the disturbance created by eggs being
temporarily removed so that they can be candled. Secondly, candling eggs
during artificial incubation is a necessity. By making careful observations
during the incubation period, we are able to determine many factors con-
cerning the fertility of the egg, the correctness of the artificial incubation
parameters and the health of the developing embryo. These determinations
are based on candling procedures conducted periodically through the incu-
bation period.
A candler used for making observations can range from a simple pen-
light torch (flashlight) to the multi-featured electrical models (e.g. Lyon
Hi-Intensity Egg Candler) with such features as varying light source inten-
sities and adjustable light beam diameters. All of these candlers have their
strengths and their weakness in performing the tasks. The pen-light or
torch version is popular because it is portable. But it is difficult to use in
areas where daylight illuminates the area, because the egg must be covered
with one's other hand to darken the egg. Another shortcoming is the
limited light beam intensity. Most torch candlers are adequate for candling
eggs from Anseriformes, Psittaciformes and Passeriformes;however, eggs
from the thicker shelled orders such as Struthioniformes and some Grui-
formes can only be candled with a more powerful candler. In order to
candle eggs with thicker shells, eggs must be transported to an electric
candler if a power source is unavailable. Transporting eggs can be risky
and leaving the nest with the eggs can result in the parent birds abandoning
the nest. It is said that 'necessity is the mother of invention' - this case is
just such an example.

Animal Park, ranging from Struthioniformes to Passeriformes, a portable
candler had to be designed so that proper data could be collected from
eggs found anywhere in the Park's 1800 acre facility. The candler had to
combine the beneficial features found in the electrical and torch versions.
Additionally the candler had to be somewhat rugged because of some of
the rough terrain travelled when visiting each nest site.

The module consists of three basic components: the protective outer
shell, candling chamber and the electrical apparatus (Figure 1). A standard
utility box was chosen because of its strong durable outer shell which is
constructed of a steel alloy. The exterior size of the box was determined
by the absolute minimum amount of space needed to house the candling
chamber and the electrical components. In this way all available space is
used which makes the entire unit compact.
The candling chamber was designed to provide flexibility for candling
the largest to the smallest eggs, from Ostrich to hummingbird. By incor-
porating data regarding various egg dimensions the chamber size was
determined. The material for the floor of the chamber is made of foam
rubber which serves as a shock absorbent cushion and the convolutions
in the material aid in the prevention of eggs rolling around once placed
on the chamber floor. The only protrusion inside the chamber is the light
source which is also padded to minimise the risk of damage to the eggs.
Lastly, the electrical components are made to give the candler two light
beam intensities. The 12 volt beam is used for eggs that are thin shelled
and by using the reduced beam, the risk of over-heating the embryo is
minimised. The 24 volt beam is used for the thick, dense shelled eggs.
Discretion must be employed as prolonged exposure during candling to
a concentrated heat source can be detrimental to the embryo (Brown,
1979).
The control panel consists of a single toggle switch, two push button
switches and adjoining monitor lights. The toggle switch allows the opera-
tor the option of choosing between the 12 and 24 volt light beams. The
two spring loaded push buttons activate the light source only when the
button is depressed, thus acting as safeguard so that the lamp cannot be
mistakenly left on to deplete the batteries. Also the lamp is only activated
when the button is depressed, which allows the lamp to cool between
candlings. The interior portion of the electrical control panel is illus-
trated (Figure 2).

First the candler is placed on a stable, level surface. The operator
then chooses from a series of rubber grommets for a size which affords
the best fit between the lamp and the egg. Depending on the diameter
of the egg to be candled, a rubber tube is equipped with inter-
changeable rubber grommets (ranging from 1cm to 3cm) which provide
the proper fit around each egg, thus concentrating the light beam.
Gently the egg is placed in the candling chamber. The reason for
placing the egg in the candler first is to reduce the risk of breaking the
egg in your hand while attempting to insert both hand and the egg into
the hand port at the end of the candler. Once the egg is in the chamber,
the operator's hand is placed back inside the chamber. When the inner
lid to the candling chamber is closed, the operator's eye is at the
viewing porthole so that the area, even in bright sunlight, remains
darkened. The lid is then closed. Based on the type of egg being
candled, the operator can choose between the 12 and 24 volt power
sources simply by turning the toggle switch to the appropriate position.
The egg is placed up to the light bulb which is encased by a rubber tube

which prevents the egg from coming into direct contact with the lamp.
While looking through the eye piece in the top of the lid, the push
button is depressed, activating the lamp.
The control panel is regulated by the left hand as the egg is viewed
in the darkened chamber. Gentle rotation of the egg aids in determining
the egg's developmental status (common knowledge). The egg is again
carefully laid down, the hand removed and the lid opened. This process
is repeated as needed.

Since the portable candler was first developed in 1987, it has been
used extensively for many species of avian eggs at the Wild Animal Park
except in the incubation facilities. The candler can detect embryonic
development in the eggs of those species which can be realistically
candled. For eggs which cannot be candled because the shells are too
thick or dense (e.g. Red-crowned Crane Grus japonensis ) radiographing
the egg when it is near hatch represents an alternative method. Ad-
ditionally, hatching facilities at the San Diego Wild Animal Park are
equipped with an electric candler (Lyons Hi-Intensity candler, Cata-
logue No. 950-76). Using the portable candler in the candling room
may increase the risk of cross contamination of pathogens such as
Pseudomonas acquired during field work which can be detrimental to
the eggs already in the incubators. For this reason both the portable
and the electric candlers are used.

Nestor notabilis TOWARD ITS MIRROR IMAGE
By Drs. JUDY DIAMOND &amp; ALAN BOND
(San Diego Natural History Museum, California, USA)
A mirror image has long been known to influence the social beha-
viour of birds. Mirror image stimulation is considered an effective and
consistent way of provoking prolonged bouts of threat display (Gallup,
1968; Serpell, 1982). There is also evidence that it can have a quieting
effect on some birds (Andrews, 1966). Gallup and Capper (1970)
showed that some birds will actually prefer a mirror image to con-
specifics, a preference that increases over periods of up to 18 days.
At the San Diego Zoo we had the opportunity of observing the
behaviour of a Kea Nestor notabilis toward its mirror image under con-
ditions of constant exposure over a period of 12 months. Keas are
highly social birds, living in flocks of up to 13 animals in mountain
forests on the South Island of New Zealand (Clark, 1970). They have
been bred successfully in a number of zoos (e.g. Schmidt, 1971; Mallet,
1973; Mitchell, 1981; Sieber, 1983).
In June of 1987, a previously paired eight-year-old male Kea was
transferred from the San Diego Wild Animal Park to a solitary cage in
the San Diego Zoo to await the arrival of additional Keas from New
Zealand. After several weeks in the new location the bird appeared
listless, but repeated visits to the hospital provided no indication of
parasites or other illness. He remained hunched with his feathers
fluffed for long periods and began to pull out his scapular feathers.
On 27th September 1987, we introduced two stainless steel mirrors
into the Kea's cage. During the first two weeks the Kea displayed a
broad range of responses to the mirrors. From the moment they were
in place, the bird went up to them and examined his own reflection.
The examination involved a series of brief glances toward the mirror
image followed by gaze aversion. Initially, the bird appeared mildly
aroused, displaying a partial erection of the crown feathers and an
erect stance. Later, the Kea's contact with the mirror consisted of
periodic, tentative touches with the bill. The mirrors also appeared to
elicit 'marking' behaviour (described by Keller, 1976, at the Zurich
Zoo), in which the cheek area between the cere and the orbit is rubbed
repeatedly along the substrate.
By the afternoon of the third day, the bird exhibited a different
suite of behaviours to the mirrors. He was observed to move deliber-

ately in their vicinity, with his gaze maintained downward and his
feathers fluffed. These postures are components of submissive displays,
given by subordinate to dominant individuals (Potts, 1977). On the
fourth day after introduction, however, the bird was observed to
spend his afternoon rest period by preference on the perch next to the
mirror, periodically waking up and touching his bill to that of the
image.
Twelve months after the initial introduction, the Kea continued to
be interested in and to interact with his mirror image, displaying
primarily non-aggressive social behaviours. He spent a considerable
amount of time looking at himself in both mirrors and commonly
slept on the perch in front of one of them. The bird would stand
next to either mirror with his body in contact, stare into it, touch it
repeatedly with his bill, look away and then repeat the actions. Some-
times he vocalised while touching the mirror, a meow call we have
observed in juvenile Keas in the field. He then typically adopted a
resting posture, remaining in full body contact with the mirror.
The introduction of the mirrors appears to have had a striking
impact on the bird s listless state. Reports from keepers indicated
that the Kea's appetite was restored after the introduction of the
mirrors, and the animal was generally more active. Incidents of feather
pulling were generally reduced in frequency. At the end of the 12-
month period, the mirrors were removed from the cage and the Kea
was introduced to his previous mate. Within 48 hours of the intro-
duction of the female, normal courtship and mating behaviour were
observed.
Although mirrors are clearly not a substitute for the company of
conspecifics, these observations suggest that the introduction of mirrors
can be an effective way to maintain responsiveness in temporarily
isolated individuals of highly social species.

BIRD ACOUSTICS IN RUSSIA
Tapes of birds and other animals in the service of

extraordinary. He has recently - 1985 - celebrated the completion of a
quarter-century of work: taping, archiving and analysing sounds of animals.
He is the founder of the Soviet Archive of Wildlife Sounds of the USSR
Academy of Sciences, and is compiling what could be called the Great
Soviet Encyclopaedia of Bird Songs - a work of immense scientific signifi-
cance. At the other extreme, he has produced pop discs of nature's chorus
in a Russian birch forest that have sold two million copies. This gentle, cul-
tivated father-of-three has wide interests beyond the voices of the wild. In-
deed his work as scientific director of the archive is part-time - so many
hours a week supervising the staff and two months each year in the field
capturing on tape the voices of the wild. Boris's main job in life is as pro-
fessor of biophysics at an institute in Puschino-on-Oka, a small 'science
town' an hour's drive by the new road out of Moscow. But I suspect that
his first love is his scientific involvement with the sounds of nature.

250 million Soviet people in his passionate interest in registering for science,
for the people and for posterity, the voices of the Soviet wilderness. Today
'bioacoustics' has really caught on in Russia: in science, in education, in
economics - and even in art. As we shall see.
Economically, to get on the same wavelength as an animal - literally -
by playing back its voice to its congener in the forest can sometimes give
you a degree of control over that animal. A municipal official might be
able to repel Starlings Sturnus vulgaris with a dispersal cry. A hunter can
get a game bird to give away its position with its reply. A commercial sea
fisherman dreams of coaxing fish into his net by 'talking' to them. The
prospect of all this really tickles the Soviet fancy.
But as is usual with scientific work, the 'pure' enquiry usually has to
precede the subsequent 'application'. Scores of 'pure' scientists are in-
volved, and as might be expected in Soviet Russia many women have
played a significant role.
As long ago as 1963, the famed and formidable Leningrad ornitholo-
gist, Irene Neufeldt, went on an expedition to the Soviet Far East - the
USSR, easily the largest country on earth, has 11 time zones - and taped
birds' voices. 'My very first was Caprimulgus indicus (the Jungle Nightjar)',
she told me, 'but my best and most beautiful was the song of Monticola
gularis (the White-throated Rock Thrush)'. These two recordings, and
others, were made in the Amur region near Komsomolsk. (The Amur is
the great river that forms a boundary with China.) Resident in nearby
Vladivostock is Natasha Litvinenko who has studied the voice of the Black-
tailed Gull Lams crassirostris on Russia's Japan-facing coast. North of
there, in the Sea of Okhotsk, T.Yu. Lisitsyna taped the voice of Steller's
Sea Lion Eumetopias jubatus and related what she heard to the behaviour
she saw. Irene Boehme (whose father, grandfather and great grandfather
are or were also ornithologists) has also gone east to the Amur region. Her
task was to tape the vocal repertoire of a good-looking bird called the
Daurian Redstart Phoenicums auroreus. She found that the species' vocab-
ulary consists of eight different calls (three of which are used only by
nestlings and fledglings) plus the song of the adult male. She can give you a
'translation' of each utterance.
The first Soviet scientist to tape sounds produced by fishes, wild and
free under the surface of the sea, was Elizabeth V. Shishkova. She recorded
the sounds created in the Black Sea by drum-fishes (Sciaenidae) which
vibrate their swim bladders to create a noise. It had been hoped at one
stage that the play-back of fish sounds might have helped fishermen to
catch them, but fish communicate at such short range that it proved im-
possible to 'talk ' them into nets. The dream was shattered.

is the Prioksko-Terrasny Biosphere Reserve on the bank of the Oka river.
There, Marina Zablotskaya studies the voice of the Common Redpoll
Acanthis flammea. It breeds not only across the breadth of the Soviet Union,
but also in temperate North America. Ms. Zablotskaya found that this
bird has as complex a repertoire as any other known bird species. She
describes, and illustrates with 'voice prints' derived from her tape record-
ings, 22 calls, each with its own meaning. Also three types of song used
by the cock bird: before pairing he has one tune, while courting a second,
and once paired a third. The hen does not sing but has six uniquely female
calls and nine that she shares with her mate. The male has four calls that
only he utters. The remainder are used by chicks in the nest, and by fledg-
lings until two months old. Obviously communication by sound must be
of some importance in redpoll life for so sophisticated a language to have
evolved. How can the Daurian Redstart get away with a vocabulary of nine
sounds, not 25? The answer may lie in the greater colourfulness of the red-
start. Much of its communication could be by visual means - by semaphore,
not Morse code. The two species (a finch and a thrush) must have rather
similar communicationary needs&amp;apos;, but accidents of evolutionary history
seem to have brought them to different answers.
The husband of the woman who studies the languge of Steller's Sea
Lion is Alexander A. Nikolsky. He, too, is a bioacoustician working on
mammals. He earlier studied the vocal behaviour of the Elk Alces alces.
More recently Nikolsky has climbed with his recorder above the tree line
to enquire into the language of the Alpine Marmot Marmota marmota, a
burrowing rodent. One of his students, Nicolai Formosov (the charming
son of one of the USSR's most distinguished ecologists and gifted nature
writers, A.N. Formosov), has been enquiring into the importance of sound
in the lives of Pikas Ochotona princeps. Pikas are small mammals akin to
Rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus but with smaller ears. Other Soviet scientists
like Eugene Panov (dubbed by some, the finest Soviet ornithologist of his
generation) of Moscow's Institute of Evolutionary Ecology and Morph-
ology, study the songs of wheatears Oenanthe - small specialised thrushes
with white rumps. The croaks of amphibians interest B.D. Vasiliev and the
stridulations of insects gain the attention of R.D. Zhantiev. Both men
work at the Lomonsov State University on Moscow's Lenin Hills. The
tape recorder is an indispensable item of equipment for all these workers,
female or male.
But not all of them go in for species studies. Some may tape record
the voices of half a dozen apparently closely related species - say, three
kinds of cichlid fish (Cichlidae) as in the case of Igor Nikolsky - and use
the differences and similarities in their language to help determine their
phylogeny - geneology. Yet other workers may be interested in relating

the kind of sounds creatures of birch woods may make, as distinct from
steppe dwellers, for one of several selective pressures put by evolution
on the physical form of a sound is the acoustic environment in which it
is created and through which it has to travel. It is not difficult to imagine
the 'blanketing' effect that residence in a reed bed may have on the sounds
of vocalisers like the Reed Warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus that live there.
Perhaps certain frequencies 'get through' better than others?
A young ornithologist from Lithuania, the westernmost (geographically
and culturally) of the 15 Soviet republics, has become a specialist on the
voices of gulls. He is called Pranas Mierauskas and is working for his zoolo-
gical doctorate. So far he has taped in Lithuania the voices of the Great
Black-backed Gull Lams marinus , Herring Gull L. argentatus, Black-
headed Gull L ridibundus and Common Gull L. canus. Also the cries of
the Black-legged Kittiwake Rissa tridactyla north of the Arctic Circle near
Archangel on the White Sea, and of the Slender-billed Gull Larus genei on
the shores of the Black Sea to the south. Pranas has also climbed high into
the Pamir Mountains (whose highest peak is also the loftiest in the USSR,
Mount Communism, 24,690 feet - 7525m) to capture on tape the vocabu-
lary of the Tibetan Gull Lams bmnnicephalus at its only nesting location
outside China. The Pamirs are in Tadzhikistan. In nearby Kazakhstan nests
the Relict Gull Lams relictus, a bird unknown to science until 1968. There
is a colony on Lake Alakol on the Soviet border with Chinese Sinkiang.
The home of the Relict Gull is among Pranas' immediate objectives as are
the marshes of the Kolyma delta in extreme north-eastern Siberia, the
summer home of Ross's Gull Rhodostethia rosea, and the seabird 'bazaars'
of the Soviet Pacific coast where the Red-legged Kittiwake Rissa brevi-
rostris comes ashore each May to converse with its mate and rear its young.
Within the borders of their country, it is comparatively easy for Soviet
scientists to travel and since the USSR is 7,000 miles from west to east and
3,000 miles from north to south, there is a lot of choice as to habitat type
and animal species.
To attempt translations' from the language of gulls is potentially
important since these birds are among the most troublesome on airport
runways, causing expensive damage to aircraft every year, and some
deaths, as we shall later discuss.
To get on the same wavelength as the animal by playing back its own or
the voice of another of its species can be a powerful tool.
Playback will usually work lor a limited initial time, for example in
keeping Rooks Corvus frugilegus off fields of winter wheat in Lithuania-
or even Starlings out of the cherry orchards; but often a law of diminishing
returns sets in as the creatures habituate to the sound.
Some birds have proved impossible to shift. Few are as immovable as

House Sparrows Passer domesticus , surely one of the world's most canny
birds. Many sparrows winter in Yerevan, the capital of the Armenian Sov-
iet Socialist Republic, where they are noisy and messy. But getting them
to 'move along' has proved an intractable problem.
With keeping Starlings out of vineyards in Kazakhstan, however,
Anatole Serna had considerable success as did A.D. Dzhabbarov in the
neighbouring Soviet Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan. Dzhabbarov
worked out of the zoology department of the University of Samarkand,
the legendary city in Uzbekistan conquered in turn by Alexander the
Great and Genghis Khan. Dzhabbarov recorded distress cries of the Star-
ling to scare invading and hungry hordes of these birds from the grape
fields.
E. Shernazarov had similar success keeping Common Mynahs Acrido-
theres tristis out of vineyards elsewhere in Uzbekistan, near the republic's
capital city of Tashkent.
Tashkent is the third largest city in the Soviet Union, and its airport is
correspondingly busy. Easily the most serious problem created for man
by birds is the damage they can cause to aircraft that fly into them, and -
less frequently - the human death toll that can result. Data on collisions
with Soviet civil aircraft, let alone military planes, are difficult to come
by, but Soviet openness about their research into possible solutions to
the problem has been commendably in the spirit of scientific kinship.
Their scientific literature is considerable, and the bird-strike problem so
important that the Soviets have coined a new term: aviation ornithology.
The necessary background - pure research has had to be not only into the
role of sound in the daily and seasonal lives of the 'pest' species - mostly
gulls, waders, crows and starlings - but also into their spring and autumn
migration behaviour patterns (which may involve radar tracking of birds
on the move) and into the feeding behaviour of both these birds of passage
and of birds that nest in the vicinity of airports. It has to be born in mind
from the start that the solution may prove not to be a bioacoustic one;
or at least not only so. As things have turned out, however, the use of
sound repellents is one important weapon in the armoury of he who
would strive to keep runways clear of birds - at least at those times when
aircraft are due to take off and land!
Work has been done on the potential bird-strike problem in the Crimea,
Soviet Central Asia, the Soviet Far East, the Kalinin region and the Baltic
states. V.S. Shevyakov and A.V. Tikhonov have described in some detail
the successes achieved at airports in Lithuania. To start with, it is impor-
tant to study the behaviour of the birds concerned, be they Rock (Town)
Pigeons Columba livia , Lapwings Vanellus vanellus (shore birds), Starlings,
members of the gull family like the Black-headed, Common and Herring

Gulls, or, lastly, members of the crow family like the Hooded Crow Corvus
corone comix, the Rook and the Jackdaw C. monedula. Some of these
species (e.g. the pigeon) may be year-round residents. Others may occur
mainly on northward spring migration and southward autumn migration,
e.g. the Starling. Others may breed in the area, e.g. the Rook, Jackdaw,
and why the birds use the airport is important to determine. All species
will feed there; others will rest by day in the comparative safety of a wide
open space where approaching predators like Goshawks Accipiter gentilis
can be spotted in better time. Yet others choose to roost there by night.
In late summer and autumn, following the breeding season, there are more
birds and a higher percentage of inexperienced ones who behave differ-
ently from adults. Before trying to change something it is important to
know from what behavioural base one is starting.
Prevention is better than cure.So in instances where, say, breeding
colonies of Rooks alongside Kaunas airport or of Black-headed Gulls by
Palanga airport; or winter assemblies of roosting crows are occupying
stands of trees near Vilnius airport, they are dispersed by playing during
the nest-building period or at the start of evening congregation a mixture
of alarm and distress cries. An alarm cry is given by a bird when it spots a
potential enemy and it acts as a warning; a distress cry is emitted by a
bird that has been caught. It is an interesting, and in these cases, an
exceedingly useful fact of nature, that alarm and distress cries - unlike
birds' songs - are not specific to each species. No. Because a Jackdaw can
make use of a Hooded Crow's alarm cry, and vice versa, natural selection
has caused the form of the alarm call of each to converge. So, faced with
a mixed-species flock on the runway, the Soviet scientist plays one spe-
cies' warning but gets a simultaneous response from several species.
The 'prevention before cure' principle finds another expression, this
time on the part of the man in the control tower looking out at an air-
field dotted with loudspeakers. He can more easily deter birds by playing
back to them before they have landed. Once they are on the ground it is
more difficult to shift them. Indeed it can often prove necessary to follow
on with supplementary acoustic effects: gunshots and thunder-flashes; the
more so in autumn when inexperienced adolescent birds figure largely
in the flocks of, say, gulls and starlings.
The Starling is the most common bird likely to be involved in a col-
lision with an aircraft and moves about in sizeable flocks. It is the most
common of all at migration time when populations bound for destinations
both near to Lithuania and very far from there, move through.

THE COLLECTION AT LEEDS CASTLE

On one of the finest Saturdays last summer, a party of members of
our Society visited Leeds Castle, at the invitation of the Directors and
David Frank, Curator of the new aviaries at this historic castle. The visit
must have been nostalgic to those of our members who remembered the
wonderful collection of parrots owned by the late Lady Baillie, who was
the last owner of the castle.
The new aviaries, which were opened to the public in 1987, are most
impressive being hexagonal in shape and constructed in the main from
stainless steel which will ensure their durability for many years to
come. All the aviaries were well stocked but not overcrowded, with a
number of rare species being displayed under ideal conditions.
The collection ranged from representatives of the cockatoo family
to the small waxbills and finches. Most of the collection was well
labelled, which makes the exhibits so much more interesting to the
visiting public, and often helpful to the aviculturist who may have
difficulty in identifying rarer species.
The birds are supported by a nursery where young birds are weaned
off, an incubation room and a finely appointed kitchen, where all the
specialised foods are prepared under ideal conditions. These extra
facilities are essential to a collection such as this where breeding is of
prime importance.
The cockatoos were represented by the Red-vented, Palm and
Leadbeater s, all in pairs, with the hopes of breeding successes in the
future. The parrots on display included Lilac-crowned, Tucaman,
Yellow-headed and Blue-fronted Amazons, a single Kea, for which a
mate is hoped to be obtained, and Hawk-headed. Macaws such as
Scarlet, Noble and Red-lronted were on view, and to complete the
range, Red, Yellow-backed and Swainson Lorikeets.
The softbilled birds included Spreo Starlings, which had already
reared young before our visit, Red-billed Blue Pies which were nesting
at the time, as well as Royal Starlings, Violaceous Turacos, Toco
Toucans, Kookaburras and, although not really a softbill but a fruit
eater, Yellow-breasted Fruit Doves.
Ot the small seedeaters, the pair of Star or Ruficauda Finches attrac-
ted great attention from all members of the party, as they were nesting

so close to the netting that the hen could almost be touched but she sat
tight on her clutch of eggs.
As far as possible, all the birds were housed in pairs or small groups,
being carefully selected to ensure that there were no problems of bicker-
ing, etc. They were provided with plenty of the correct nesting facilities
at the same time being displayed in such a way that the public could
see the birds without causing any undue stress or disturbance to the
aviary inmates.
Congratulations must go to the planners and management of these
new aviaries for the layout, selection of birds and general appearance
of the whole area where the birds are housed. I am sure that in the
future the project will grow and I would recommend to all our mem-
bers who have the opportunity to visit Leeds Castle to go and see the
birds, the Castle itself and the wonderful grounds in which it is situated.

The President's Garden Party was held on Sunday, 4th June, 1989, at
Chestnut Lodge, Cobham, Surrey, by kind invitation of Miss Ruth Ezra
and Mr. Raymond Sawyer. The weather was kind and members were given
a conducted tour of this world-famous collection of birds, followed by
tea in the gardens. A full account of this event will appear in the next
issue of the Avicultural Magazine. Meanwhile, on behalf of everyone who
was able to come (and once again, we regret that some members had to
be disappointed) we would like to thank Miss Ezra and Mr. Sawyer for
such an enjoyable and interesting afternoon, and for most generously
donating the ticket money to the Society's funds (over #300 including
donations was received).
Details of the autumn social meeting and of the Annual Dinner will
be sent to members separately.

A trio of Grey-winged Trumpeters (2.1) Psophia crepitans, produced a
total of 35 chicks in a single year; 26 being hand-reared and nine being
parent-reared. The breeding trio were housed out of doors and on exhibit
in a planted aviary measuring approximately 12 x 40 x 13 ft high (3.66 x
12.18 x 3.96 m). The Trumpeters share the aviary with a variety of soft-
billed species. Their diet consists of Nebraska Brand Bird-of-Prey food,
moistened dog food, eggs, small seeds, chopped fruits, new-born mice and
live food (mealworms and crickets). The diet for the chicks, both artifi-
cially and parentally reared, is the same as above. Eggs were incubated
from day 1 at 99*F and 88*F wet bulb. Incubation is 28-29 days. The
adults prove to be good parents and the chicks in all cases do not prove
difficult. Eggs were laid in a small cave about 2m from the ground.
The Buff-crested Bustard Lophotis ruficrista registered a first breeding
for the Society in 1988 and may be a first breeding for North America
(Marvin Jones, pers. comm.). The trio (1.2) are exhibited outdoors in a
planted aviary with similar dimensions to the trumpeter exhibit. They
share the exhibit with various African softbills and a pair of Kirk's Dik-Dik.
Eggs were laid on the ground in a shallow scrape. Artificial incubation is

19-21 days at 99*F and 88*F wet bulb, and the chicks were hand-reared
without mishap on a diet of turkey grower, apple and greenstuff.
The pair of Blue Whistling Thrush Myiophoneus c. caeruleus bred in
a walk-through aviary shared by over 20 species of softbills and pheasants.
They built a mud and debris nest on a cross-member under a structure
designed to shield the visitors from the elements. The three eggs pulled
for hand-rearing hatched after 16 days, incubated at 100.5*F and 86*F
wet bulb. The hand-reared chicks survived for 18, 17, and 12 days, being
fed on a diet of cat food slurry (with papaya and apple sauce) later weaned
to whole fruit chunks, crickets, newborn mice and mealworms. The second
clutch was left for parental rearing. Parental diet was fruits ad lib., moistened
dog food, Ziegler Lo-Iron pellets, chopped egg and live food (crickets and
mealworms).
A species new to San Diego and, according to Raethel (1988), never
before exported from Saudi Arabia is the Philby's Rock Partridge Alec-
toris philbyi. A group of eight birds was imported from Taif, Saudi Arabia,
in September 1987 and began laying in May 1988. The breeding pair laid
off exhibit in a pheasant run measuring 8 x 20 x 8 ft high (2.44 x 6.10 x
2.44m). Diet was small seed, pheasant crumbs, greenstuff and apple. Arti-
ficial incubation lasted 24-26 days at 99.5*F and 84*F, and chicks were
fed a diet of ground starter crumbs, weaned to turkey grower with mixed
seeds, greenstuff and hard-boiled egg.
A second desert partridge, the Arabian Sand Partridge Ammoperdix
heyi intermedia, also imported from Taif in the same shipment with the
Philby's Partridge, laid in May 1988. Two breeding pairs laid both on and
off exhibit. One pair is housed in a cage similar to that of the Philby's
Partridge. The second pair is housed on exhibit, out of doors, in a planted
aviary shared by African finches and bee-eaters. Adult and chick diet was
as for the Philby's. This is probably a first breeding, if not first importation
for this species of desert partridge (Raethel, 1988; Seth-Smith, 1911;
Trevor-Batty e, 1905).

The recovery efforts for the Californian Condor were given a fresh shot
of optimism on 29th April 1988, when the first Californian Condor con-
ceived in captivity, was successfully hatched. On 24th September 1987,
courtship began and copulations were first seen in the third week of Jan-
uary, 1988. On 3rd March the egg was finally laid and immediately re-
moved from the nest by the birds' keepers and artificially incubated in a)

Petersime incubator. The parents of Molloko (a Northern Maidu Indian
name for the condor), were both wild-caught individuals; the female (UNI)
is a bird of unknown age while the male (AC-4) was eight years old.
Daurian Redstart Phoenicurus auroreus
To the best of our knowledge, this delicate thrush has not been bred in
American collections. On 29th May the female began collecting nest
material. We suspected that eggs had been laid on or about 8th June and
on the 25th both birds were seen taking mealworms to the nest. Though
what happened is not known, two days later the birds began rebuilding the
nest. On 26th and 30th July, one live chick and two dead chicks respec-
tively were discovered. The single chick survived.
African Pygmy Falcon Polihierax semitorquatus
The African Pygmy Falcon, like most other falcons, does not build
its own nest; on occasion it will evict occupants but usually takes over
an abandoned nest. In the case of the pygmy falcon, the host nest-builder
is the Buffalo Weaver. Although in Europe the pygmy falcon breeds well in
a standard nest-box, we were able to offer an old Buffalo Weaver nest. The
pair first laid a three-egg clutch; the eggs were fertile but died early in
incubation. A second clutch of three eggs was laid and the eggs were taken
for artificial incubation and one chick was successfully hand-reared. A
third clutch of two eggs was replaced with dummy eggs while their eggs
were artificially incubated. One chick was hatched, placed under the
parents and successfully reared.
Great Indian Hornbill Buceros bicornis
Courtship behaviour and visits to the nest-box began in earnest in mid-
February. The female spent most of her time in the box mudding up the
doorway with the assistance of the male. One egg was laid some time
between 27th March and 3rd April. A blind and helpless chick was
hatched on 9th May. At two weeks old, the chick's eyes were still closed
and there were no signs of feather tracts. On 26th June the female left
the nest-box. The chick was fully feathered and about two-thirds the
size of the female. By 22nd July the chick began venturing from the box.

Tanygnathus actually means 'extended jaw' - referring to the bill - but
to me it means the neglected parrots. Few genera available in aviculture
(albeit sporadically) have been so neglected by aviculturists and few are
so poorly represented in the literature. A.G. Butler, writing 80 years ago,
gave more information than can be found in most modern parrot books.
Five species are recognised but only three are known in aviculture and
few breeding successes have been recorded. It is worth noting that in 1988
not only did three species produce chicks at Loro Parque, Tenerife, but
that in two cases the hatchings occurred within four months of the pairs
being put together.
Tanygnathus have affinities with the genera Psittacula and Eclectus;
indeed, in German they are given the same name as Eclectus: Edelpapagei.
They are medium-sized parrots, i.e. about T2in (31cm) in length, except
the Great-bill which is about 15in (39cm) long. They are basically green
but two species have intricate and extremely beautiful wing markings.
Their tails are short and not as wide as those of Eclectus.
They originate from Indonesia, the Western Papuan Islands, the Moluc-
cas and the Philippines. Very little is known about their behaviour in the
wild. It is of interest that two species, Muller's and the Black-lored, have
been described as nocturnal on occasions, even on moonless nights.
The Great-billed T. megalorhynchus (often written megalorynchos after
Forshaw, 1973, or megalorynchus) is found in Indonesia (Lesser Sunda
Islands, Western Papua, Moluccas, Celebes), also Balut in the Philippines.
The preferred habitat is coastal and small islands. Plumage is alike in male
and female but the male's bill is noticeably larger.
The Blue-naped Parrot T. lucionensis is from the Philippines (Luzon,
Mindoro, Polillo, Palawan and the Sulu Archipelago), islands off north-
eastern Borneo and Talaud Island. It inhabits forest and open country.
The male usually has brighter and more clearly defined wing markings
than the female.
Muller's Parrot T. sumatranus or muelleri comes from the Philippines
including the Sulu Archipelago, Talaud and Sanghir and Celebes. At least in
Celebes, it is found along forest edges, rarely in the interior. In this species
the bill is red in the male and whitish in the female.
The Black-lored T. gramineus is from Burn Island, Indonesia. Very

little is known about it but it has been observed in the mountains, above
700m. The bill is red in the male and whitish in the female.
The Rufous-tailed Parrot T. heterurus is a mysterious bird, supposedly
an aberrant specimen of Muller's Parrot and known to scientists only
from the type specimen, thought to be from Celebes. I have, however,
seen photographs of several Tanygnathus with the underside of the tail
rufous in a holding cage in Indonesia and perhaps three or four years ago
heard that similar birds had been imported into the USA - but no further
references have been made to them. Also, there are references to this
species in An Investigation of Parrots and their Trade on Pulau Bacan
(North Moluccas) and Pulau Warmar, Aru Islands by G. Randy Milton and
Agus Marhadi, a report published by WWF/IUCN in 1987. Table 17 lists
the estimated retail value of parrots imported from Indonesia into the
USA in 1984, and includes 13 T. heterurus with an estimated retail value
of 400 dollars each. Appendix V gives records of species exported from
Indonesia from 1981 to 1984 and includes 85 heterurus in 1981 and 205
in 1983. Someone, somewhere, must know something about these birds!
The slight increase in the appearance of Tanygnathus in trade this
decade can be directly linked to deforestation and logging activities,
since areas recently opened up by logging are usually favoured by parrot
trappers in Indonesia. In 1984 and 1985, for example, the quotas for the
"legal harvest" of the Great-billed Parrot from Indonesia were 5,750 each
year yet none was recorded as being exported from Indonesia in 1984
by the relevant authorities.
I suspect that losses with newly captured and recently imported Great-
billed Parrots are quite high and this may deter importers from bringing in
these birds, together with the fact that many parrot breeders have never
seen Tanygnathus species and therefore have no interest in them. Dealers
often can sell the rarer parrots only to visitors to their premises - and not
by advertising them - simply because breeders have so little curiosity about
species with which they are not familiar. The Tanygnathus tend to be
quiet, rather inactive aviary birds, yet there is something appealing about
them that grows on one. They are capable of harsh sounds yet more often
utter quiet conversational sounds. If they are shy, it is difficult to get to
know them; in the 9m long aviaries in which they are exhibited at Loro
Parque, all except the male Great-bill fly away from the public.
On exhibit in a different area of the park at the time of writing are the
three 1988-hatched, parent-reared Tanygnathus , one 1987 lucionensis
bred in Germany and a surplus Muller's. The 1987 lucionensis is an ex-
tremely beautiful, tame and inquisitive bird and his influence is taming
down the 1988 young bird, which remained nervous while with his parents.
In fact, this aviary is situated with its length along the path where an

average of 2,000 people pass daily. In similar situations all the birds in the
park are tame. Those near the dolphinarium, where the remainder of the
Tanygnathus are housed, can fly the full length of the aviary away from
the public, thus they alone are not tame.
Undoubtedly my favourite individual is the male Great-bill. Soon after
I became curator in February 1987, I wrote to Blackpool Zoo in the UK
to try to obtain this bird on breeding loan. At that time the species was
represented at Loro Parque by a single female who had laid eggs when on
her own. I was delighted when Blackpool Zoo generously sent us this bird
on loan on 20th December 1987, and I was enchanted by his tameness.
In January, at the end of the quarantine period (within the park) he
was introduced to the female. By 9th February she was incubating two
eggs. These were infertile, no doubt due to the haste with which they
were laid! They were removed before the end of the incubation period
and by 18th March the female was incubating two eggs in the second
clutch, which was to number three eggs. One of these was removed to the
incubator where a chick hatched on 14th April. Another chick hatched
in the nest on 15th April and when it was established that it was being
fed, the first chick was placed in the nest. I was more excited about the
hatching of these chicks than any others at Loro Parque in 1988 - but
alas, my satisfaction was short-lived. One chick was found dead in the
nest on 22nd April; it had enteritis, pericarditis and swollen spleen and
liver. The other was removed for hand-rearing but was not thriving. It
died on 29th April, apparently from an infection of the heart.
Within a month the female had laid again; she had one egg by 17th
May which was infertile. She did not lay again until 26th November,
probably stimulated by the few rainy days during the preceding three
weeks. The period between May and October was virtually rainless. Un-
fortunately, the two eggs in the November clutch failed to hatch.
The only successful breeder of this species, to my knowledge, is Herr
Leidner in Germany. He first bred it in 1984. The breeding pair proved
infertile between 1985 and 1987. At the end of 1987 four birds, including
the breeding pair, were housed together in an indoor aviary measuring 7ft
6in (2.5m) square, while the old aviaries were being rebuilt. The female of
the breeding pair laid two eggs at the end of February. Two chicks had
hatched by 25th March. They were removed for handrearing at the age of
20 days, but no details of this were given (Leidner, 1988). The female laid
again 25 days later.
A little more is known about the Blue-naped Parrot than the other
members of the genus. It was the first to be bred in captivity, in the
USA in 1937. Little more was recorded about it until the late 1970s when
a few birds were imported into Europe and the USA. Penny Luczak of

West Virginia was, in 1979, the next American breeder. In Germany there
have been several successes (Leidner, 1984; Krohn, 1984) and in the UK
in 1983, as the result of the combined efforts of George Smith and Ken-
neth McKenzie, and by David Alderton. In France, this species has been
reared by Marc Boussekey and at Loro Parque, Tenerife, one was hatched
in 1988. It was reared by the parents who are rather nervous and nest
inspection revealed little when the chick was small as the female would
not move off the nest. (This was a nest-box measuring 12in [31cm] square
and 30in [77cm] high.) I was unable, therefore, to collect as much infor-
mation as I would have liked. Smith (1984) described the display and
copulation.
The following can be gained from these few breedings. In at least one
instance the female did not commence incubation until the second of the
two eggs was laid. Then both chicks hatched within two hours of each
other and after 25 days (Krohn, 1984). George Smith (1984) found the
incubation period to be 26 days and Mrs. Bonestell (1937) reported that
it was 28 days. The Loro Parque chick hatched after 25 days.
Eggs are laid every other day, or every third day, and the clutch size is
iwo or three. It seems that they are like Eclectus in that some males will
enter the nest and feed the young from soon after they hatch. In one case
it was recorded that the male spent more time in the nest than the female.
The Loro Parque male spent a lot of time in the nest.
Newly hatched chicks have very thin, sparse down. They weigh lOg. At
three weeks they are covered in the second down which is greyish-white
or dark grey. The eyes open at between 12 and 18 days. The chicks reared
by Krohn were ringed at 13 days with a 7.5mm ring. The one reared at
Loro Parque was ringed at 13 days with a 9.5mm ring. I would suggest
that 8.5mm is the best size.
Krohn recorded the weights of his two young (hatched on the same
day) as follows: 10 days, 42g and 57g; three weeks, 140g and 125g; six
weeks, 215g and 200g. The eldest left the nest at 54 days weighing 225g
and the second chick at 63 days (210g). The 15g difference in weight was
maintained and Krohn believed that the eldest, which had a larger beak
and head, was the male.
If the lucionensis bred by Leidner did hatch after 23 days then it
spent 63 days in the nest. The two reared by George Smith's female left
the nest at 56 days. The one reared at Loro Parque was first seen out of
the nest at 73 days although it might have left before as it spent several
days looking out and was very shy. It then had nearly as much blue on the
crown and nape as the adults (they are of the nominate race) but the shade
was duller. There was no blue on the wing coverts which were green mar-
gined with yellowish green.

The first recorded breeding of Muller's Parrot occurred in 1984 in Flo-
rida. M.D. Moll and K.K. Muser put a male (estimated to be six years old)
and a female together in May 1983. They started working in the nest-
box in early September. The box measured 12in (31cm) square and 2ft
(61cm) high. Two eggs were laid in early November at intervals of two
days, but these proved to be infertile. The two eggs of the next clutch
were laid on 27th and 29th January. It was stated that female and male
took part in incubation. A chick hatched on 21st February; two days
later the other egg was checked and the chick found to be dead-in-shell.
Assuming that it was the first egg that hatched, the incubation period was
25 days.
The chick was removed for hand-rearing at the age of eight days
because its crop was empty when checked on two occasions that day. For
the first two weeks the food consisted of soaked and blended monkey
chow, peanut butter, carrot, banana, endive and a vitamin additive. After
two weeks dry oatmeal baby cereal was added to the food to thicken it.
The chick was weaned at 11 weeks old.
The pair that bred at Loro Parque in 1988 had been together for several
years. Courtship feeding had been observed. They were then housed in the
previously mentioned aviary with its length along the path, i.e. in close
proximity to the public. On 11th January 1988 they were moved to one
of the new 27ft (9m) long aviaries in the dolphinarium area. The female
laid the first of three eggs on 31st May. The male has always been unable
to fly, the feathering of his wings and tail being extremely poor. This did
not stop him fertilising eggs, however. The first chick hatched on 25th
June; the nest was inspected almost every day so the incubation period
could have been 25 or 26 days. By 1st July there were two chicks.
Nest inspection gave little or no information. When the chicks were
small the female refused to leave the nest. When they were old enough
to leave unbrooded during the day, she would rush back to the nest as
soon as anyone touched the aviary door. There was a danger that the male,
who is very timid and tailless, would fall on to the concrete floor and
injure himself as he became very concerned when the aviary was entered.
It was impossible to inspect the nest from outside the aviary so nest in-
spection was carried out only once a week.
The main difference between the chicks of lucionensis and sumatranus
is the beak colour. In lucionensis this becomes red well before the chick
feathers. The two sumatranus bred at Loro Parque had the bill pale horn
coloured with the upper central part of the upper mandible greyish on
leaving the nest. The grey colour gradually disappeared until, by Novem-
ber, the beak was clear horn coloured in one young bird.
The first chick had left the nest, apparently prematurely, on 28th

August when it was sitting on the aviary floor unable to find its way back -
despite the wire ladder from floor to perch which is kept in the aviary for
the male's benefit. The young Muller's was replaced in the nest and did not
make another exit until 6th September. I first saw the second chick out of
the nest about seven days later. Prior to that, it had spent most of the day
for several days leaning out of the nest entrance.
The immature birds differed from the adults only in the beak colour
and eye colour, the latter being greyish. In adults the iris is white; by 1st
December one of the young birds had a whitish iris, while the other still
had the iris greyish. Their plumage was perfect when they left the nest,
whereas the lucionensis had been plucked on the back and wings but
feathered up quickly after fledging.
The three young Tanygnathus were removed from their parents during
the second week in October and, as already mentioned, soon became
tamer in company with an adult bird of each species. I would often pause
in front of the aviary to admire the exquisite beauty of the wing markings
of the 1987 lucionensis and the much more subtle beauty of the young
sumatranus. Apart from the soft blue rump, the body feathers are entirely
green, of several different shades - and yet the plumage is extraordinarily
pleasing, The dark eyes of the young birds give them a doe-eyed, gentle
appearance which is lacking in the adults. Parrots with a striking white iris
can never look gentle!
In fact, they are very gentle birds and from the limited information
available it seems that in some cases more than one pair can be kept
together without problems. For example, Leidner's 1988 breeding of the
Great-bill occurred in an aviary measuring 2.5m square in which two pairs
were housed.
Tanygnathus appear to be like Eclectus in that they accept a wide
variety of food items. At Loro Parque they are fed on a mixture consist-
ing of soaked and sprouting sunflower, sprouting gorbanzas (chick peas),
boiled peanuts, peanuts in the shell (their favourite), chopped apple,
orange, cactus fruits (in season), peas, carrot and Swiss chard. Other
foods are given in season, such as the small orange fruits of a species
of palm which grows well in the park.
Tanygnathus can also be offered a mixture of small seeds such as
canary, millet, oats, buckwheat and a little hemp, spray millet, other
fruits such as grapes and pomegranates, berries of hawthorn and elder,
cherries, walnuts, hazel nuts and pine nuts.
When rearing young, our birds are offered fresh corn on the cob and
bread and milk with a calcium additive. Krohn offered a rearing food
consisting of grated carrot, milk powder, the yolk of hard-boiled egg,

calcium and vitamins.
The nest boxes at Loro Parque measure approximately 12in (31cm)
square and 2ft (61cm) high for lucionensis and sumatranus and 30in
(76cm) high for megalorhynchus. Wood shavings are used in the bottom.
Egg measurements are as follows: T. lucionensis - 34 x 28mm, 32.5 x
27.5mm, 34 x 28mm, 33 x 27mm, 37 x 28mm (Loro Parque) and 33 x
28mm (two, Krohn). Weight of a fresh egg was 12.5g (Krohn). Two
megalorhynchus (Loro Parque) measured 29 x 45mm and 29 x 43mm.
I was unable to obtain any measurements for the sumatranus eggs at
Loro Parque as there were only two and both hatched.
Perhaps these notes will encourage other aviculturists to record their
experiences with this very interesting genus of parrots which is so little
known and under-rated. Much remains to be learned about them.

Introduction
This paper describes the experiences and success of the Denver Zoo
bird staff with the captive breeding of the Hooded Pitta. Although this
species has been bred in captivity before (Olney, 1984; Olney, 1987), we
were unable to find specific information on the breeding or hand-rearing.
References were found for the captive breeding of two other Pitta species,
Van den Bosch's Pitta P. guajana irena (Vernon, 1974) and the Giant
Pitta P. caerulea (McKelvey and Miller, 1979).
Description
The Hooded Pitta is a brilliantly coloured ground bird of the Asian
tropical forests. The crown of the head is a rich chestnut brown, the face
and neck are jet black, and the eye is a deep brown. The back is leaf-
green washed with blue, the rump is an iridescent sky-blue, and the tail
(which is very short) is black and white. The wings are leaf-green with an
iridescent sky-blue patch on the shoulder. The primaries are mainly
black but there is a large white patch in the centre of the wing which is
invisible when the wing is folded but very striking during flight. A colour
photograph of a wild bird (Perrins and Middleton, 1985) shows the belly
a brilliant scarlet but all our captive birds have belly feathers ranging from
rose-pink to a pale buff-pink, separated from the aquamarine breast by a
black band. The sexes are identical. There is no eclipse plumage.
Our Hooded Pittas have a calm and fearless temperament, which is
especially pronounced during the breeding season. Two which are housed
in a small, glass-fronted display habitually sit on the window ledge, inches
from the public. Our breeding pair, which is housed in a large, walk-
through aviary, become so bold during the breeding season that they fre-
quently fly at shoulder height through the crowd and have been known to
stand or even sunbathe on the public walk at the busiest time of the year.
In the non-breeding season, our Hooded Pittas are solitary birds who
avoid conspecifics as much as possible and may be dangerously aggressive
to each other if housed together in too small an enclosure. As the breeding
season starts, the birds begin to chase each other. They can frequently be
seen displaying in turns, the display consisting of stretching slowly up to
the most extreme height and then suddenly lapsing back to a normal pos-

ture, while rapidly bobbing the tail up and down and giving an odd,
growling vocalisation. (This growling vocalisation is also heard during
the non-breeding season.) One bird will sometimes stand in front of the
other and flick open the wings, displaying the bright white wing patch.
Also limited to the breeding season is a distinctive advertising call of two
clear, sharply falling, emphatic, whistled notes. Both sexes give the same
displays and calls.
History
1986-1987. Our first pair of Hooded Pittas arrived in October, 1986.
After a three-week quarantine, they were released into a large, walk-
through aviary in the Denver Zoo's "Bird World". This aviary measured
about 22m (70ft) long, 7.5m (25ft) wide, and 7.5m (25ft) high. The
ceiling was composed almost entirely of banks of skylights. During the 1987
breeding season, 85-90% of these skylights were covered with translucent
plastic panels. Most of these panels were removed during the winter of
1987-1988, so that during the 1988 breeding season 90% of the skylights
were clear glass and the natural daylight in the exhibit was much brighter.
The exhibit had no artificial lighting.
Water was supplied by a waterfall 1.5m (4ft) high, consisting of a series of
descending, shallow pools which fed a concrete stream l-2cm (V 2 - lin) deep
and 3m (1 Oft) long. The stream ended in a pool about 2m (6ft) across
and 60cm (2ft) deep. The floor was composed of natural soil. During the
1987 breeding season, live and artificial plants provided a dense and ex-
tensive canopy, sparse understory, and moderately sparse groundcover.
During the 1988 breeding season, only live plants were present and pro-
vided a less extensive and less dense canopy, moderate understory, and
thick, extensive groundcover.
At the time the Hooded Pittas were introduced, this spacious room
housed 14 different species of birds, ranging from the Crested Wood Par-
tridge Rollulus roulroul to the Sparkling Violet-Ear Hummingbird Colibri
coruscans. The species composition and total numbers of birds in the
exhibit have varied during the Pittas' tenure. In general, the Pittas seem to
take no notice of other birds, the only exceptions being interactions with
two other ground species, Crested Wood Partridges and White-fronted
Crakes Laterallus leucopyrrhus when these were nesting at the same time
as the Pittas.
During their first six months in the exhibit, both Pittas apparently
remained solitary in their habits. While they were observed, they were
seen at opposite ends of the display.
In May 1987, the first breeding behaviour was observed. On 25th May
the female began displaying. She stood in front of the male, spreading her

wings. After this, the Pittas were seen together much of the day.
The next day both birds were observed performing the talLstretch dis-
play described earlier. On 27th May the male was observed crouching on
the ground vocalising, with the female standing nearby. The vocalisation
sounded like the growling of a small, hoarse dog. The next day the male
was in the same area and again vocalising. On 1st June this area was found
littered with twigs and leaves.
On 4th June the male Pitta was seen attempting to arrange twigs and
leaves on the nest site, but with little success. On the same day, it was
noted that a pair of Crested Wood Partridges had started to build a nest
in a raised planter pocket situated in a corner at the opposite end of the
exhibit from the Pitta activity. The completed nests of Hooded Pittas and
Crested Wood Partridges are superficially similar in size and shape, being en-.
closed domes on the ground about the size of a large honeydew melon
with a round entrance low on one side. The nest-building techniques of
the two species, however, are strikingly different and their nests can be
distinguished at every stage of construction
By 7th June, the Pitta pair had nearly completed a large globular nest
on their site. Many twigs were used for the superstructure and among the
twigs were woven dried leaves, dried weed stems and pine needles. At the
planter site the Crested Wood Partridges had scratched out a depression
2.5cm (lin) deep and 20cm (8in) across, and piled leaves and twigs in it.
Later that day, the female Pitta was seen sitting in the Crested Wood
Partridges' nest site. The male Pitta began bringing twigs to this site.
The pair of Pittas completed their nest on the Partridges' site on 10th
June. Both male and female contributed to its construction. Both species
were active on the site and in and out of the nest during this time.
Our experience with these two species indicates that Hooded Pittas
lay one egg each day, for a clutch of one to four and begin incubating
immediately after the last egg is laid. Both sexes seem to share equally
in incubation. Crested Wood Partridges lay a clutch of two to seven eggs
and may lay every day or every other day. Only the female incubates,
starting sometime on the same day as the last egg is laid, and during the
laying period spends very little time in or near the nest. The male does
not go in the nest at all, although he often stands near it.
On 11th June the Pittas were observed with an egg. Three days later,
three more eggs were observed under the Pittas. On the 16th both the
Pittas and the Partridge female were seen using the nest. Between 16th
and 22nd June, several conflicts were noted between the two species
over the ownership of the nest. On several occasions, the female Par-
tridge was seen to physically push the incubating Pitta from the nest and
enter it herself. The Pittas would then stand nearby, vocalising, flicking

the wings open, and bobbing the tail furiously. For fear of disrupting the
Pittas' first breeding attempt, the nest had not previously been closely
examined. On the 22nd, a careful check revealed six Partridge eggs and one
broken Pitta egg. The Crested Wood Partridges were moved to a different
display and their eggs removed from the nest. The Pittas abandoned the
nest on the same day.
Over the next few days, various attempts were made by both Pittas to
build nests in several locations. On 29th June another almost complete
nest was found on a rock ledge near the waterfall. The twig superstructure
had the usual material woven into it and both birds were carrying dried
cottonwood cambium for the lining.
The Pitta female was observed sitting in the completed nest on the
30th. The next day, the pair began taking turns in the nest, presumably
incubating. Because of the inaccessibility of the nest and the fear of dis-
turbing the birds, no attempt was made to verify the presence of eggs.
On 12th July, an egg was laid just outside the lip of the nest. This egg
was removed and artificially incubated in a Petersime incubator (Model 4,
Petersime Co., 300 North Bridge Street, Gettysburg, Ohio 45328) at 58%
humidity, 28*C (86*F) wet bulb. This egg was fertile and developed for
14 days but died in the shell on 26th July, four days short of hatch.
Three days later, another egg was found outside the nest. This egg
was returned to the nest by the keeper. On 22nd July, the nest began to
fall apart but the birds continued to sit. They finally left the nest on
26th July after sitting continuously for 26 days, eight days longer than the
incubation period for the species. The nest was checked and two cold eggs
were found. Upon candling, they were found to be infertile.
On 28th July another nest superstructure was found on the ground
under a splitleaf plant Monstera deliciosa. The birds continued to work on
it until 2nd of August. Several days later it was abandoned completely.
On 18th August the male began a post-breeding moult. The two Pittas
resumed their solitary habits and remained at opposite ends of the display
throughout the winter.
In 1988 the breeding pair began to show the first sign of interest in
early March, chasing, tail-stretching, and giving the two-note advertising
call. Nest-building began on 11th April and the first nest was completed
on the 18th. Two eggs were laid on 22nd and 23rd, incubation beginning
as soon as the second egg was laid. Both the male and the female contribu-
ted equally to nest construction and incubation. The incubating bird
typically spent four hours on the nest before trading off with its mate.
After 18 days of continuous incubation, one egg hatched. The second
egg was infertile and the parents rolled it into the back of the nest. Both
parents took turns feeding and continuously brooding the chick. They

first began to leave it unattended for brief periods on 17th May, five days
after hatching. At this time, the chick was alert, covered in pinfeathers,
with the eyes well open. After this, the frequency of brooding dropped
off rapidly. The parents continued to feed the chick attentively.
On 20th May the male began building a new nest at the opposite end
of the exhibit. The next day the female joined in the nest-building activity.
Both parents continued to feed the chick, which was now beginning to
feather out. Building and chick-rearing continued simultaneously until
the early morning of 25th May when the chick was found, limp and un-
responsive, on the edge of the nest. It died half an hour later. Necropsy
showed the gizzard to be tightly packed with a matted mass of indiges-
tible plant fibres and coarse sand. The cloaca was impacted with gravel.
Apparently the parents had begun feeding nest material to the chick
when they started to line the new nest.
On the same day, the female laid the first egg of a second clutch in the
new nest. She laid another egg each day for the next three days and
began incubating when the clutch was complete. During the incubation
period, the male was stepped on while lounging on the public walk and
two toes of the right foot were broken. The foot was splinted and the
bird returned to the exhibit. He continued to share in the incubation
duties as though nothing had happened, despite being caught up several
more times to check the foot and remove the splint.
This clutch hatched on the 16th day of incubation. All four eggs
hatched on the same day. This time the parents rarely brooded the chicks
during the day, spending all their time bringing food to the nest. The
parents kept the nest scrupulously clean, removing all faecal sacs to the
farthest point of the display.
All four chicks were healthy and developed rapidly. As with the
first, lone chick, all had their eyes open and were alert and responsive
by the end of the first week. At this stage, they looked remarkably like
little black hedgehogs - the pinfeathers erupted completely before the
sheaths started to open up so the birds were covered in long quills. They
had wide faces, beady black eyes, and a short beak that tapered to an
abrupt point like a snout. Their defensive behaviour in the nest was in
keeping with their hedgehog-like appearance. If the nest was disturbed,
the babies backed as far into it as possible, rumps in the air and heads
tucked down under their shoulders, hiding their faces and making all the
long quills bristle out.
These chicks were removed for hand-rearing on the eighth day after the
parents were seen carrying wet, decaying leaves mixed with gravel to the
nest. It was feared that they would begin feeding such inappropriate items
to the chicks, as they had done before. The parents protested loudly,

getting under foot and attacking the keeper, when the chicks were re-
moved. Three of the chicks were successfully hand-reared; the fourth
died on the 17th day, apparently of an acute bacterial infection.
The day after the chicks were removed, the pair began building a third
nest. They chose a bad site, however, one readily accessible to the public.
The nest was broken up by the keeper several times a day for three days,
until the birds gave up and selected a better site. Previously, all their nests
had been built on the ground but this time they chose a 150mm(6in)
square wooden ledge nailed on the wall a b Tie over 2m (8ft) above the
ground, which ordinarily held a food bowl. The bowl was removed and
the birds completed the nest on 27th June, after working on it for eight
days. Four eggs were laid on successive days from 28th June to 1st July,
incubation again starting with the laying of the last egg of the clutch. All
four hatched after 15 days of incubation.
For the first four days, the parents attentively cared for the chicks, as
they had done with the previous brood. On the fifth day, the female was
found in the early afternoon in another exhibit. It seems that a delay in
the delivery of our live food items (crickets, mealworms and waxworms)
that day caused the female to go hunting out of the exhibit. She was
caught and put back in her own exhibit. She had been out for a maximum
of one hour, but on her return she was at once attacked by the male. He
drove her to the opposite end of the room from the nest and would not
allow her to approach it, jealously guarding the chicks from this intruder
and continuing to feed them faithfully. This went on for three days. The
female lost 7g and was removed on the third day to another exhibit.
The male took excellent care of the chicks on his own. With the female
absent, it seemed unlikely that he would begin to carry around nest
material and feed it to the chicks, so it was decided to let him rear the
brood to independence. However, on 25th July (day 10), he began limping
on the left foot. Close examination showed the sole of the foot was
fissured with deep cracks, probably the result of stress from favouring the
broken toes of the right foot earlier. There was no option but to remove
him for treatment and hand-rear the chicks. All four were successfully
reared.

Nesting: In addition to our successful breeding pair, the Denver Zoo
has two other pairs of young Hooded Pittas, acquired in October 1987.
Both of these young pairs have completed nests; one pair laid eggs but
broke them all. The information on nest construction combines data from
all completed nests, six built by the successful pair over two seasons and
one each built by the young pairs.

In every case, the birds utilised an existing corner, nook or ledge as
the starting point for the nest. One nest was built, as mentioned, on a
wooden ledge; one was built in a hollow of a large, decaying stump; the
rest were built on the ground, against a wall or corner, using to advantage
the surrounding vegetation and preferentially placed on high ground. The
birds began by constructing an arch of twigs which was then enclosed
into a globe with a round entrance low on the front side. In the case of
the nest built on the feed ledge, the birds first laid down a platform of
twigs in which to wedge the uprights of the arch. All our Pittas pre-
ferred 15-25cm (6-1 Oin) twigs about the diameter of a pencil. Twigs cut
from Virginia creeper vines Parthenocissus quinquefolia were preferred
above all others for the construction of the shell. The birds made no
attempt to conceal their activities and worked throughout the day.
The twig shell was next reinforced and waterproofed by working in
fresh and dried leaves and fern fronds, bark shreds, and decaying leaves
mixed with earth. The successful breeding pair, which had the widest
variety of materials available, used leaves of Ficus spp. and cottonwood
Populus spp, Bougainvillea spp. leaves and flowers, fronds of Boston
Ferns Nephrolepis exalta bostonensis, Maidenhair Ferns Muehlenbeckia
complexa , squirrel's-foot ferns Davillia griffithiana, table ferns Pteris
spp., hare's-foot ferns Polypodium areum and tree ferns Cibotium spp.
(tree fern fronds, which are very touch, were cut into convenient lengths
by the keeper); sprigs of Wandering Jew Tradescantia fluminensis ,
shredded cottonwood cambium, papyrus rootlets Cyperus papyrus , dried
day lily leaves .Hemerocallis spp., pine needles Pinus spp., and decay-
ing plant matter. Most of these items were naturally available in the
exhibit from the start.
The third stage of construction was the lining of the nest with fine
fibres. Our birds preferred 125-200mm (5-8in) sisal fibres from shredded
rope; they also used pine needles, fine, dried grass and fine cambium
shreds. Shredded cotton twine and muslin threads were offered but not
used. The experienced birds could complete a nest in five to eight days;
inexperienced builders required much longer.
Diet: The diet available to our Hooded Pittas is a broad-spectrum soft-
bill diet which covers the nutritional needs of a variety of species which
share the Pittas' aviary. Of the food items available, either intentionally or
unintentionally the Hooded Pittas have been seen to eat soaked dog chow

nuts, and whole hardboiled eggs, blended in an industrial food processor),
crickets, mealworms, waxworms, slugs, cockroaches, earthworms, centi-
pedes, and occasionally finely chopped fruit. All non-live food items are
dusted with bonemeal and vitamin-mineral powder (Vionate Brand, ARC
Laboratories, P.O. Box 18884, Irvine, California 92713). The birds some-
times eat dirt, and grit is continuously available in the exhibit.
The breeding pair was observed to feed all of the above, with the
exception of fruit and centipedes, to chicks. However, they showed a
very strong preference for waxworms as chick food, followed by meal-
worms, crickets and earthworms. The remaining food items were offered
with no clear pattern of preference when more favoured items were
unavailable. Because of the definite food preferences shown by the parent
birds, waxworms, mealworms and 9mm (3/8in) crickets were tossed to
them six to eight times per day when chicks were present. Undoubtedly,
the continuous availability of these highly preferred live food items con-
tributed significantly to the chick-rearing success of our pair.
Hand-rearing: In both cases, the hand-reared broods were removed
from the parents' nest and placed together in a large artificial finch basket
tipped on its side and lined with dried grass and sphagnum. This 'nest' was
put in a 40 x 30 x 35cm (16 x 12 x 14in) wooden brooder box with
Plexiglass (Perspex) slides for the top and front. The box was kept at
32*C (95*F) by a 25-watt light bulb during the day and a heating pad
under the box at night until the chicks fledged.
While the chicks remained in the nest, they were easy to feed. After
overcoming the inevitable initial hesitation to accept food from forceps,
they gaped readily. They were fed to satiation once an hour from dawn to
dusk. The diet consisted of soaked dog chow, chopped newly-born mice,
and meat dusted with bonemeal and vitamin powder, waxworms, meal-
worms (heads crushed with forceps first), and whole 9mm crickets. All
food items were dipped in water before feeding. The second brood was
also fed a &amp;apos;Pitta Mix' made of l A cup soaked dog chow, l A cup meat, one
hard-boiled egg yolk, 1/8 teaspoon bonemeal, and a pinch of vitamin
powder mashed well to mix. The Pitta chicks seemed to like this mixture
and other birds which were offered it took it eagerly also. The favourite
food items were waxworms, 9mm crickets, and chopped newly-born mice.
A chick would typically accept 15-20 waxworms, 10-12 crickets, or 8-10
pieces of baby mouse per feeding.
Both broods fledged on day 12 from hatch. The nest was removed from
the brooder box and the bottom of the box lined with hay and dry leaves.
Several perch twigs were placed in the box and, most of the time, the
chicks preferred to perch on these twigs rather than stand on the floor of
the box.

On day 14, the first brood was separated and each chick placed in its
own 60 x 60 x 60cm (2 x 2 x 2ft) wire mesh cage, lined with hay and pro-
vided with perch twigs and water and food bowls. The second brood was
placed, all together, in a mesh cage 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.2m (4 x 4 x 4ft), also
lined with hay bedding. In addition to perch twigs, this cage contained
several dense sprays of silk foliage for sight barriers, which the birds did
use to hide in. All the chicks showed an immediate interest in bathing in
their water dishes and thereafter would bathe several times a day.
The second arrangement proved to be the better by far. Pittas are not
sociable birds and the ones which were put in separate cages soon became
very territorial and could not be put together, even in a larger cage, with-
out serious fighting. The group housed together from the start in a larger
cage never fought. This group also weaned themselves from hand-feeding
a full ten days earlier than the birds housed singly.
After fledging, all the chicks lost their appetites for two days, refusing
to beg and regurgitating food if force-fed. Although they began to eat
again on the third day, they became infuriatingly difficult to hand-feed,
begging loudly and constantly but backing away, turning aside the head,
closing the mouth, or running away as the food was presented. They were
fed every one and a half hours for about two weeks after fledging, then
every two hours until weaned. The group housed together began eating
reliably on their own at day 35. The birds housed singly weaned them-
selves around day 45.
The first food item to attract their interest was live crickets. These were
offered in a steep-sided, smooth plastic tub with pebbles in the bottom.
Most of the crickets tried to hide in the pebbles and the birds soon learned
to stand in the tub and pick them out. Crickets that jumped out were
quickly chased down and eaten. Several days after learning to catch
crickets, the chicks began to eat waxworms and mealworms out of a low
dish and within seven to ten days had learned to take meat, soaked dog
chow, pitta mix, and chopped, newborn mice from the dish also.
When removed for hand-rearing at day 8, the first brood of four birds
ranged in weight from 36.4g to 44. lg. The second brood, removed at
day 10, weighed from 38.7g to 41.8g. All chicks were weighed twice a day,
usually at 0800 hrs. and at 1630 hrs., for about two weeks, and then once
a day until it was felt that they were well established. Their daily weights
fluctuated maddeningly but showed an overall slow gaining trend. The
range of weights at fledging for eight birds was 36.0g to 43.2g, average
39.5g. The range of weights at weaning for seven birds (one died) was
44.lg to 59.2g, average 50.lg. A healthy adult weighs 63-68g.
The juvenile plumage of the Hooded Pitta is similar to the adult plu-
mage, but all colours are muted and dull. The crown of the head is a

light brown, the face and neck are dull black. The upper back is a dusty
olive-grey, the lower back turquoise-grey, the rump is a dull and vaguely
iridescent turquoise, and the tail is dull black. The wings are dusty olive-
grey, shading out to turquoise-grey and differ from the adult in having
five dull white spots on the coverts. The primaries are dusty black on the
leading edge shading to dark turquoise-grey on the trailing edge. The
belly feathers are a pale salmon-pink and shade into the light ash-brown
of the breast. The beak is black with the tip and the commissure bright
orange.
The response of hand-reared Hooded Pittas to humans is very satis-
factory. The birds do not actually like people and avoid contact and
handling like wild birds. When caught up, however, they do not suffer the
same stress and panic as wild birds do, a feature which is to their advantage
in a captive setting.

The word 'rare' in the title of these notes is intended to be compara-
tive, and not necessarily absolute. The Tri-coloured Munia Lonchura m.
malacca, for example, would hardly be described as rare by anybody (yet
there is a rare morph that occurs naturally in the wild). On the other hand,
the Black Munia L. stygia , has probably only been seen by a handful
of readers. And what of the Grand Valley Munia L. teerinkil Having
hopefully provoked the reader's interest, allow me to digress at the start to
explain my circumstances, and thus avoid prompting questions that might
arise later, but will be unanswered.
I returned to England to live in London, in September 1984, after an
absence of 19 years. For over 28 years now I have worked for an inter-
national advertising agency, and continue to do so. My assignment in
England was to last four years and was to be responsible for one of our
major worldwide clients. This meant visiting many countries all over the
world every year. Unfortunately,a job that keeps one travelling (I was out
of England for a total of 26 weeks in 1988) does not allow much time for
a private life. I'm now an expert on taxi cabs, hotels and restaurants
in some 26 countries, but my ornithological and avicultural experiences lag
way behind.
Nonetheless, I have managed to meet many different kinds of bird
people, from conservationists to trappers, museum curators to shippers,
bird watchers to bird keepers, and, of course, aviculturists, zoos and bird
markets. So this crazy peripatetic life of mine these past five years has
obviously had some great upsides. The downside, however, has meant
being away from home more often than is good for a serious bird keeper.
When I'm home I struggle to catch up with my birds, but my wife and
family also need rather more attention. It has also meant that my bird-
room has lacked the quality and quantity of attention it really needs.
For the last 40 years I have kept and studied finches, and during my
four years in England I concentrated on those finches I'd been unable to
keep in the past. Since leaving England in the mid-1960s, I've lived in
North and South America, Europe and Japan, and I have concentrated
on the local birds every time. I guessed that my career would take me next
to the Americas again, so while in England I did my best to concentrate on
rare Asian finches. And that brings me to the subject of this paper. These

notes or reminiscences deal with one single genus, the Lonchura. I have
already written about some species in this genus in the Avicultural Maga-
zine recently so it might be appropriate to begin with a postscript to the
notes on the complicated subspecies L.m. malacca.
The TRI-COLOURED MUNI A L.m. malacca was one of the com-
monest of imported finches in the period after the war when most birds
imported from Asia came from Bombay. They came with Avadavats and
Indian Silverbills and it was common for immature Nuns, as the munias
were called, the Avadavats in eclipse plumage and the Silverbills to be
coloured with a vegetable dye - either yellow, green or red. The Tri-colours
were the first birds I ever kept, in 1947. I well remember a friend, many
years ago, telling me that there were two kinds of Tri-coloured Munia -
one with the white breast and belly, the other cream. He had seen a small
black and white photograph of the two morphs in a German magazine. I
thought at the time that the cream-breasted bird would have been a first
year adult and the cream would moult white the following year, and for-
got about it. Then, a year or so ago, I was invited to talk at a meeting of
the East Anglia branch of the Australian Finch Society. Among the birds
that members had brought along to sell were two pairs of a distinct morph
of the Tri-coloured Munia that I had not seen before. The breast and
flanks were creamy, and finely vermiculated. Each breast feather had a
fme brown shaft line, and the edge of the feather was brown also. They
belonged to Colin Rowe, who had spotted them in a shipment received
by a dealer the year before. He had kept them through the moult, and
they had all four moulted true. I understand there were a few others in
that shipment. I also understand that some were included in a shipment
received early in 1988.
I then remembered Malcolm Hough of House of Feathers sending me a
corpse of this species, still lingering in my freezer awaiting a moment to
be painted. I took it out and to my delight it too had the scaled breast
feathering. Malcolm had kept the bird in his private collection for a couple
of years and it had obviously moulted true. I have since seen a few in the
holding cages filled with munias in the Bombay bird market. I am not
sure if this is the 'cream-breasted' form that my friend saw in the German
magazine, as I never saw the photograph, but I suspect that it is. My
drawing (Fig. 1) risks being too bold, as the brown lines are not strong
and outstanding. It is not the same pattern as the Indian Spice Birds L.p.
punctulata or L.p. subundulata , and is definitely not a hybrid. My guess
is that it occurs at the rate of about 3.0% of the population.

patterned munia from the island of New Guinea. Birds have reached
Europe in very small numbers in recent years, and a few dozen were
imported into England directly from Indonesia in 1988. It is a bird of
savannah, grassy marshland, and the reed beds and grass banks along
the sides of the rivers in the Trans-fly of southern West Irian Jay a and
Papua New Guinea. It is locally common, but very rare in aviculture.
In size it is about 115mm long. The adult has a white face, crown
and cheeks, graduating into a grey nape and sides of neck. The feathers of
the nape have brown centres, giving a some vhat scaled appearance. The
back, wings and tail are earth-brown; the rump and uppertail-coverts are
chestnut-orange; vent and undertail-coverts black. The bill is blue-grey
above, pale blue-grey below; legs and feet blue-grey. The sexes are alike
but in birds that have moulted into final adult plumage the male is notice-
ably whiter on the face and crown than the female, and is more richly
coloured on the breast and flanks.
Newly-fledged juveniles are a dull earthy-brown above and rusty-
brown below, darker than typical immature munias. However, they
quickly moult into first adult plumage when the black bib is speckled
with brown, and the head is more greyish and flecked with brown. The
rest of the body colours are a little duller than in the definitive adult
plumage. In this condition it is easy to take one of these birds for a hen,
selecting one with an all-black bib for a cock, but the former could as
easily be a cock.
It is a very pretty munia, its distinctive head patterning lending it a
quirky appearance of personality. It has a habit of stretching upwards,
with head at a normal angle, looking around alertly, when the head takes
on an arrow-head appearance. I have experience with them four times
now and have found them to be delicate and unpredictable until they
have moulted into final adult plumage, and are well and truly established.
They are lively and alert. Males can be lively to the point of being bump-
tious, but females are definitely more delicate than males at any time.
Birds that keep the feathers of the nape somewhat raised, giving a slightly
bull-necked or hunched appearance are not well and should be hospitalised
and kept in quarantine (by which I mean a secluded and peaceful cage) for
several weeks, and even then should be watched carefully (Fig. 3).
The sexes of birds in the same plumage condition are alike, but, as
mentioned above, in my experience the male has the white of the head
cleaner and whiter. However, the best way to sex them when choosing from
a cageful is to place a likely pair in separate cages and listen to their call
notes. The call notes of males and females are slightly different in tone. I
once selected two males and two females this way with Ron Miller, who had
imported them from Indonesia, confessing that he could not tell any dif-

hunched posture undirected singing
lerence in the sounds at all. I cannot say that all munias can be sexed in this
way but I now have several species confirmed. Of course, it is necessary to
colour band the birds and keep notes on their subsequent behaviour. Of
these four birds, two appeared to be whiter on the head than the other
two, so I took a fifth bird with a darker head, hoping that it would be a
female.
In their holding cage, all five birds roosted together in a roomy,
half-open nest-box, but when released in the bird room took to roosting
in the shadow underneath the overhang of some ornamental ferns
placed on top of a flight cage. One male, banded Blue Left was seen to
be singing freely on several occasions, always undirected. I saw him
espy a L. teerinki alone nearby and he turned towards it still singing.
Then, stopping for a moment, he grasped a bent of straw, flew across to
the other bird and sang alongside it. The crown was raised (heightening
the 'arrow' effect), breast fluffed and flanks spread. There was no
dance or leg stretching, and no turning from side to side. The L. teer-
inki was unaffected and soon flew off.
Blue Left became very attached to Red Right and followed her
around. This pair successfully took possession of a nest built and occu-

pied by a pair of L. teerinki , in the middle of a large roll of plastic fenc-
ing stuffed with hay and grasses.
Then I went off on one of my world travels, leaving the birds to
efficient but inexpert care. Upon my return 10 days later, Red Right
was dead and Pale Blue Right was thick-necked. It went straight into a
hospital cage with infra-red heat, vitaminised food, etc. The next day I
caught up Lilac Right and placed her in the same cage; she was looking
suspicious also. Incidentally, I caught PBR by dropping the door of the
feeding cage. (For a feeding station, I use a large, all-wire flight cage -
the type with two large doors.) LR was caught in a drop-top trap
(bought in Spain 20 years ago) baited with mealworms. I find that fit
and dynamic munias rarely, if ever touch mealworms, whereas sick ones
will often chew them. This includes birds fresh out of quarantine,
denied a wide variety of wholesome foods. PBR died but LR
quickly became her old self. I had caught her in time.
Despite some nest building, the single female clearly never came into
breeding condition that year. They have bred on the continent. Good-
win (1982) refers to Neff as being very successful in breeding them in
Germany, and in a letter to the editor of Cage and Aviary Birds, a
couple of years ago, a Mr. Nachrichter referred to two breeders produc-
ing young. To my knowledge, it has not bred in the UK yet.
At the time of writing this (December 1988) I have one male carry-
ing a length of grass, holding it at the base end. It is a full stalk with a
leaf and a chewed-out head of grass. He flies off purposefully, stops on
a diagonal perch, looks round only to find the female not following. He
then flies towards her, alights, hops towards her, then flies off in the
same direction as before (from the main birdroom into the indoor
aviary). She, instead, flies up to the open-fronted cage by the roof where
there are some filled nest-boxes and baskets. He follows her with the
grass and I cannot see what happens. It seems as though the male is
attempting to draw the female to a nest of his choosing. She, as usual
more successful, draws him to a site of her preference.
The BLACK MUNI A L. stygia (Fig. 5) is not black as its common
name suggests, but it is the nearest thing to an all-black munia. The
head and entire underparts are glossy black, the back wings and tail are
dark brown; the rump and uppertail-coverts are yellowish. The male is
noticeably darker on its back and wings than the female. I have not
seen a juvenile but apparently it is greyish brown above with black
centres to the crown feathers and huffish grey below. If this is the
appearance of a juvenile, and not a bird moulting, then I suspect the
black speckling on the head to be diagnostic of the species. But some

young birds have been collected also showing blackish patches on the
breast and some yellow on the rump, and these were undoubtedly moulting
into first adult plumage.
It is a species of reed beds and marshy grassland country in the Transfly
part of Papua New Guinea, at sea level. It must also occur in West Irian
Jaya, where it has been collected in very small numbers for the bird trade.
It is occasionally found in the company of Crimson Finches Neochmia
phaeton and the Grey-crowned Munia L. nevermanni and it is undoubt-
edly in this circumstance that it has been trapped as the trappers are pri-
marily concerned to catch the Crimson Finches.
I once ordered a pair from Germany, along with some other New
Guinea munias. There was only one pair on offer. The 'hen' was dead on
arrival and I never saw it, but it was obviously an immature because the
'male' turned out to be a female. She was a fine, sturdy bird that went out
into the garden flight all the year round for two winters and it was a great
sadness to me that I was never able to find her a male. At one point I had
five Grand Munias L. grandis in the garden collection and the female Black
Munia made a right nuisance of herself trying to get in on the act and steal
a mate. Derek Goodwin says that L. stygia may be conspecific with L.
nevermanni , but offers no explicit argument. I believe that hybrids be-
tween the two have occurred, so presumably on the Geographic Species
Concept, they are constructed to be one species. I have always had
difficulty with the GSC as an immaculate rule, however, and do so in this

case.
My flock of Grand Munias dwindled to one remaining cock bird and
I caged him with the hen Black Munia for convenience and curiosity.
They rapidly went to nest and laid, but again my travels intervened and I
returned to find cold, dry eggs. The pair were released into the bird room
along with the L. nevermanni and, while it is not surprising that the
female Black did not pursue the male Grey-crowns, since she was reason-
ably well bonded to her 'super male', it is interesting that neither of the
fit and singing Grey-crowned males ever approached her. Maybe they
recognised her as being paired.
The odd couple quickly took command of an Amerindian basket that
had been fixed sideways on to a wire mesh door with the handle acting as
a perch. She left the male grandis to do all the work of nest-building
which he did with great energy and dedication. She was active and aggres-
sive in defending the nest against curious munias. Despite sitting tight for
ages she never laid again (at least to my knowledge). Moult, combined
with dramatically changing weather, finished the breeding season.
I have a note of a letter from A. Nachrichter in 1986 that a breeder in
Germany produced 27 young from five pairs in that year. So, while UK
records are non-existent, this munia seems to be capable of doing well
in captivity.
The GRAND MUNIA L. grandis , sometimes called the Grand-billed
Munia, is logically the next species in the sequence. It is a big bird,
about half-way in size between the Black-headed Munia and the Java
Sparrow. The entire head and underparts except for the sides of the
flanks (largely obscured by the folded wings) are black. In the hand, a
fit, healthy bird has a slight green sheen to the black. The back,wings
and sides of the flanks are chestnut; the rump is reddish-chestnut with a
golden sheen and the uppertail-coverts are orange with a golden sheen.
The tail is dark brown, edged with yellow. The bill is deep and heavy
and disproportionately large compared with other munias; it is pale
blue-grey, and the feet are slate-grey.
The adult female is on average about ten percent smaller and shorter
than the male and you should have no difficulty in selecting true pairs
by size. However, if you only have very few birds to choose from, be
careful. I had one male and one female of identical size. Of eight birds
owned by Patrick Tay in Singapore, I was able to sex accurately three
males and three females, leaving two intermediate-sized birds as unknown.
A year later those two birds had died leaving three obvious pairs. Patrick's
birds were all banded with coloured plastic split-rings. It is also possible
to separate the sexes of this species by the tone of the call note. I noticed

often how, when a pair of mine was separated, or a single bird was separ-
ated from the flock, its call note was different from that of its mate.
Almost peep and pi-pi.
I have not seen the juvenile but understand from the literature that it
is typical of the malacca type, but shows the black very early on.
I first obtained a trio, apparently a male and two females in October,
1986, the only birds of the species in a shipment from Germany. One of
the birds was an obvious male, the other an obvious female. The inter-
mediate-sized bird I took to be a female. They were fit, healthy birds and
very quickly settled in. In February the importer called me with the offer
of a pair returned to him by the original buyer. They had been imported,
also from Germany, the previous February. They were in pathetic
condition, the female totally bald from the shoulders upwards, and both
with badly, heavily scaled feet and overgrown claws. How somebody can
pay the high price that rare birds like these inevitably carry, then fail to
look after them properly is beyond me. I fear that the 'more money than
sense' syndrome is alive and well in aviculture. I kept these birds in a
flight cage in the bird room. The original trio were run in the indoor/
outdoor aviary.
The aviary flight was L-shaped and about 21ft (6.40m) long alto-
gether, richly planted. The food available was a mixture of millets
with a little canary seed in a large hopper, then my own mixture of
small oil-rich seeds and long seeds like lettuce, untreated rough lawn
grass mixtures, teazle, hemp, etc., originally blended for my parrot-
finches, millet on the spray and daily lettuce. They fed freely from all
of these showing no particular preference, and they fed on lettuce with
eagerness.
The flock of five were very lively. There was much chasing about and
excited chirruping that reminded me on several occasions of the com-
munity activity of the House Sparrow Passer domesticus. The original
trio were active, investigating nest-sites with one obviously bonded pair
usually chasing away the third bird that I took to be a female. I had only
ever seen the big, obvious male sing. It was not until the intermediate-
sized bird obviously accepted its rejection from the house-hunting
team that it began singing. By now it was early summer 1987, the new
male had died while in my own 'quarantine' but the female had grown
new head feathers and was fit enough to be released into the flight. She
was accepted immediately by the smaller male. The two pairs became a
mini-flock and stayed together most of the time.
Despite the obvious size of the typical male, when four birds are
interacting in a planted aviary, one is grateful for coloured split rings
and an ever-handy pair of close-focus binoculars. It was with such that I was

able to observe the 'House Sparrow' behaviour. In fact, I think it was
the two male birds fighting. The two females followed very closely,
apparently chirruping as excitedly as the two males. The two males,
locked together as a male/female pair of House Sparrows can be, would
fall to the ground, the females perched about a metre above them. I
could never tell which group stopped chirruping first but silence would
fall and the birds would fly off I think led by the vanquished male.
Fig. 6: Male Grand Munia undirected singing
In undirected singing, (Fig. 6) the male invariably faces forward,
that is to say at right angles to the perch. The posture is fairly upright
with the head held level or even slightly raised, the legs clearly visible.
However, when singing to a nearby or adjacent female he will be turned
slightly towards her leaning slightly over her, in a rather more crouched
position. I never observed any bobbing by the male. In all instances
recorded in my notebook, both birds remained still. At the end of the
song the birds touched beaks and remained unmoving for several seconds
(Fig. 7). They would then resume normal activity, usually by the female
flying off, to be followed by the male. The whole episode might last
some 20 seconds.
When an individual is separated from the group, it utters a plaintive
quire sound, very loud when a mate or known bird replies, usually with

equal anxiety of tone they rapidly switch to normal contact calls and
you can hear clearly the slightly different tones of the male and female.
The only other voice that I noted was when the big male took possess-
ion of a nest cavity in one of the straw banks described in an earlier
article (Fig. 8). From within the nest he emitted a long-drawn out weee-

female, however, was drawn slowly but almost hypnotically to the site.
She would go right up to the entrance but I never saw her go in.
When a pair went to nest seriously, the male would sit sentinel outside
and chase away any other munia coming close. They are nervous nesters,
approaching the nest with caution and entering directly. Despite the
aggressive behaviour of the males to each other - and the females did their
own chasing too - I never felt that the beligerence was negative. Maybe
I am overdoing the House Sparrow comparison but I feel the aggressive
behaviour was largely ritualised (there was never blood spilled nor a feather

pulled) and contributed to the females' ovulation. The two pairs nested
within half a metre of each other in the same straw bank. Both laid long,
narrow white eggs. One female died in the nest, the eggs had disappeared.
The other pair deserted.
The story takes a new twist now. We all have had cats on the roof of
our flights, but I have had children. During one of my many trips overseas,
the next-door kids climbed on to the roof of the flight to retrieve some
tennis balls, and two panels caved in about six inches or so. I returned to
find half my birds gone, including the pair cf Grand Munias. Encouraged
by this enforced discipline in dealing with overcrowding, I caught up all
the odd birds and caged them, leaving the flight to a very few lucky pairs
of Mayr's Munias and some rare South American finches. The remaining
male grandis went into a large, all-wire cage with the female stygia and a
pair of Bengalese. The female Black Munia took immediate possession of
the nest box and chased the Bengalese to the far corner of the cage. The
male grandis sang intensely to her and she responded. I had to remove
the Bengalese as they were denied all freedom of movement.
Left to themselves they behaved in a most interesting way. The male
grandis would begin a frenetic flying back and forth from one end of the
cage to the other, the stygia would usually but not always join in. It
would invariably produce some energetic bill-fencing every time they
perched on the same perch, and the exercise would end with bill fencing.
I felt that this was an unnatural behaviour by the male grandis and given
more room plus a female of the same species, would have manifest much
more like the frenetic chasing, the sparrow-like activity. Obviously their
respective behaviours produced ovulation because the hen did lay, al-
though she sat well she eventually left the eggs. I opened the cage doors
and allowed them the run of the bird room. The male soon found his
way back and sat sentinel outside the nest-box. Although the stygia
often returned to the cage, she ignored the nest, and soon took over an
Amerindian basket hanging on the door in which a pair of L. teerinki had
built a nest (Fig. 9).
The takeover was interesting. The stygia flew to the handle of the
basket and sat there motionless, pointing at the entrance cavity. The male
grandis flew to perch on top of the basket and sang continually, turning
his head slightly from side to side. One teerinki fled within a minute, the
other left five minutes later. Five seconds later, the female stygia entered
the nest. For the rest of the day, the teerinkis attempted to return to their
nest but one or other of the usurping odd couple was always inside and
would chase them away, but never further than about 2m. The next day
they began building more. The male grandis brought material aiid built

the nest. From the perfectly adequate nest built by the teerinki pair he
constructed a more elaborate tunnel that eventually completely obscured
the handle-cum-perch, and the nest could only be entered from an oblique
lower angle. The grandis would always take a straw by one end, fly
to the nest entrance, wait a moment in perfect stillness, then enter. Two
weeks later, still no eggs, but I once saw the stygia take a straw about
5in long, holding it at one end, fly on to the top of the nest-basket and
attempt to weave it into the top of the basket. The male grandis watched
for about five minutes from a distance of a metre or so, then he flew to
the nest and, from the movements of it, was obviously working on the
inside. The female then dropped the straw and flew around to the entrance
of the nest.
With the extraordinary weather changes of September and October
came a falling off of nesting activity in the bird room and they deserted
their nest.

As a footnote to the above, since writing these notes my wife and I have moved to
Hong Kong, and thus started another chapter in the bird life of the Restalls. I have
also heard that Mick Plose has bred the White-crowned Munia L. nevermanni, in a
small garden aviary. I have also heard that there have been recent importations of
Papua New Guinea munias and would very much like to exchange correspondence
with any reader with experience of them. Please write to me at 31 South Bay Road,
Hong Kong.

As will be well known to most of my readers, many species of birds in
captivity will, if permitted, continue to breed (or attempt to breed) for
many months or even years without a break or with a break only during
the main period of the moult. The Budgerigar, Zebra Finch and Diamond
Dove are well-known examples but many other doves and estrildid finches
come into the same category. Many of these are, in a wild state, birds of
arid country that come into breeding condition whenever rainfall or other
conditions produce (or sometimes as soon as they 'promise') plentiful
supplies of suitable rearing foods.
Other species, such as the Canary, will breed over an extended period,
having or attempting to have, nest after nest from late winter until the
moult, or the most complete stage of it, puts an end to such activities.
Many wild birds of temperate regions behave very similarly. Our Blackbird
Turdus merula and Song Thrush T. philomelos , for example, often lay
their first clutches of eggs in March and their last in July and, like many
other species, may actually be feeding young while in their post-breeding
moult.
Almost every book on bird keeping that I have read, whether written
by authors who are primarily fanciers, aviculturists or by ornithologists,
warns us not to let our parrots, doves or passerine birds have more than
two or three successive broods. If we let them have more, and especially
if we let them go on as long as they like, they will, we are assured, not
only be weakened themselves thereby but will produce weakly, third-
rate offspring. Always implicit, and sometimes explicit, in this advice
is that the sexes must be separated and/or kept under conditions that
prevent them from nesting for much of the year and for much of their
lives. But is this belief true? If it is true, may not the recommended
'cure' be sometimes more objectionable than the (alleged) evils it seeks
to remedy?
Taking first the claim that if the hens are allowed to lay more eggs
than they would in a wild state, indeed in some cases if they are even
allowed to lay as many, these eggs would be deficient in one way or
another and produce inferior young. Will they? Or will they only if the
bird producing them is inadequately fed? It is noteworthy that although
this claim is made for wild birds in captivity and also for domesticated

species such as the Canary and Budgerigar, it is not, or at least was not
when I was involved with domestic fowls (circa 1936-1950) made about
domestic poultry. Though fowls kept for breeding were usually kept
under better conditions and given less 'forcing' a diet (less protein and no
spices in the food) than those intended simply for egg production, still
they were expected to lay, and did lay, a very much greater number of
eggs, all of which were used without hesitation for hatching purposes, than
would any wild Jungle Fowl. The same applied to domestic Turkeys,
ducks and geese.
Breeders of ornamental waterfowl and pheasants, by robbing their birds
of their eggs and rich feeding, commonly induce them to lay very many
more eggs than they would do in a natural state (or in captivity) if all went
well and they were permitted to incubate the first clutch. Since these
'extra' eggs are used for hatching purposes, the breeders of these birds
clearly regard them as suitable to produce young from.
So, in effect, 'conventional wisdom' says: "If passerine birds, parrots
or doves lay more eggs than they would in a wild state if all went well ,
these eggs must be inferior in quality and unsuitable for breeding purposes
but this is not the case with gamebirds and waterfowl, nor with domestic
poultry." Is this really so? And, if it is so, is the cause a real difference
between the bird families concerned or is it merely due to differences in
nutrition affecting the worth of the eggs? I throw the question open to
readers and hope that some can answer it or give an opinion based on
actual experience.
There is, however, another aspect to the matter or related to it. When,
for whatever reason, one does not want one's birds repeatedly to produce
more young, what is the best, by which I mean most humane as well as
efficient, means to this end? Cat 'lovers' usually have their pets castrated
or spayed, according to sex, and the 'well-looked after' dog or bitch is, as
a matter of course and without pity, subjected to tortures akin to those of
Tantalus in the matters of both food and sex. But bird keepers are gener-
ally expected to be more considerate towards the creatures in their power.
I certainly believe that we should be.
Separating the sexes is often advocated. It is certainly effective. It is
also troublesome to the owner, to an extent varying with different species.
More important, unless the birds are out of hearing of each other a great
deal of frustration and stress is suffered by them, as mates or potential
mates continually hear and answer each other's calls and attempt to escape
and get together. If they are (by the occasional very rich owner witli
far-flung aviaries or sound-proof rooms) moved out of hearing of each
other, species that form strong pair bonds and thus suffer most from being
parted are likely to form firm homosexual or inter-specific pairs when thus

separated from conspecifics of the opposite sex, thus posing problems for
the owner if he or she ever does want to breed from them again.
Thus, separating the sexes is certainly not a humane solution, and not
always a convenient one for the owner.
Leaving the sexes together but removing all possible nest sites is an
often advocated solution. It is certainly efficient in the case of some obli-
gatory hole-nesters, but others, for example, the Zebra Finch, Canary
and Barbary Dove, will contrive to make a nest of some sort and to lay
eggs unless kept in very barely furnished aviaries or cages. In the case of
the Zebra Finch, many other estrildids and, I believe, some American
parrots, the birds normally roost in old nests and/or holes, so that forcing
them to roost nightly on a bare perch is itself a considerable deprivation.
Some species, such as the Muscovy Duck, which sit for long periods
if their eggs are sterile, and which feed little while incubating, or rather
in their brief respites from it, undoubtedly get into very poor shape if
allowed to sit 'as long as they want to'. But in species, like doves and
estrildids, in which both cock and hen share incubation, or in which, as
in the Canary and the Jay, the sitting hen is fed by the cock, I have not
known a bird of either sex ever look any the worse for sitting beyond its
time.
I read of a keen German keeper of Zebra Finches who thought the
best way to solve this problem in that species was to allow the birds to
nest and incubate sterilised eggs for as long as they wished to do so, then
letting them go to nest again and again sterilising the eggs. I have adopted
the same tactics with cordon-bleus Uraeginthus spp. without any observed
ill effects and I had the impression that birds so treated seemed happier
than others (or they themselves on other occasions) had been when de-
prived of possible nesting sites and nesting material.
I, and I hope other readers also, would be interested to hear the opin-
ions and practices of others in this matter also.

The most bizarre wild bird problem solved by bioacoustic means in
Soviet Russia concerns the Hooded Crows that used the onion-shaped
roofs of the Kremlin Cathedrals for dry ski-ing. The problem was that,
in playfully sliding down the steep slopes of the cathedral domes ('krem-
lin' means a citadel within a town and may protect religious as well as
administrative buildings), the birds' sharp claws scraped the gilt from
the expensively renovated surfaces. Further, Soviet office workers were
distracted by the raucous cawing that accompanied this playful behaviour.
The All-Union Research Institute for Nature Conservation was called in
to advise, and Dr. Alexander Sorokin came up with an ingenious answer.
The vocal repertoire of the Hooded Crow had been well studied and it was
known that one call was a cry given when a crow is captured by an enemy,
say, a bird of prey. This cry has a rallying effect on other crows within
earshot. The biological function of this cry is in itself interesting. Natural
selection's idea is said to be that if you are a crow struggling in the talons
of a falcon and you utter this distinctive cry, then other crows will rally
and maybe so harass the falcon that it lets you go. Now, by playing such a
cry through a loudspeaker, it was possible to get the crows of the Kremlin
to gather in the vicinity of the loudspeaker. But when they did so, they
found not a falcon on the ground 'mantling' its prey but a falcon flying
free and low above them having just been launched from a Russian fal-
coner's fist! This the crows found unnerving. Next, train a couple of
Kremlin workers to perform this double act two or three times a week and
you can effectively keep the area clear of crows.
I would not have believed this account but for the scientific reputation
(and established sobriety) of my Russian informant, and the fact that the
crow family is the most highly evolved of the 150 living families of birds.
Many remarkable behavioural feats, including the manipulative use of
objects as tools, are known to be performed by Jays Garrulus glandarius,
Magpies Pica pica , Jackdaws Corvus monedula, Ravens C. corax and other
members of the crow family. One recent account of two Ravens repeated-
ly 'tobogganing' on their backs down a snow slope (supported by photo-

graphs!) is the closest behaviour I know to the 'ski-ing' by the crows of the
Kremlin.
An even more remarkable account of crow behaviour was given to me
in Russia of how Jackdaws learnt to break into a hangar in which aircraft
were maintained and repaired. The birds were accustomed to nesting inside
the building, under the roof, and (like the well-known thieving Magpie)
were wont to take up and play with loose nuts and bolts lying about.
When first locked out of the hangar, birds tried to break the glass roof
panels with their beaks. Failing with that method, they later dropped from
a height nuts and bolts on to the glass and successfully gained entry! By
way of lending plausibility to the account it should be mentioned that
other members of the crow family (but not Jackdaws) are known to drop
hard-shelled food objects like mussels and walnuts to break them open. So
the glass-breaking behaviour is that much less surprising. But I digress; for
this problem was not susceptible of a sound playback solution.
A different problem was a scientific one. The Ural Owl Strix uralensis
was almost unknown in Latvia until special 'owl prowls were organised as
part of a scheme to plot the breeding distribution of all Latvia's breeding
birds (over 200 species) on a 10 x 10km grid. The organiser of the census,
which was repeated over five years, was Janis J. Priednieks of the Latvian
State University at Riga. He issued playback tapes which a number of his
eager volunteers played at night in suitably wooded places. The method
proved an outstanding success. Ural Owls proclaimed their presence in
response to apparent intruders, from well over 50 squares in the north and
east of the country; sometimes as many as 10 territorial males in one
square responding.
By reproducing a squeaking noise, another group of Latvian ornitholo-
gists set a world record during the autumn migration of 1975. They lured
into a trap on the Baltic coast of Latvia at a place called Pape, within one
month, nearly a thousand Long-eared Owls Asio otus. On the last night
no less than 214 owls were caught and then 'ringed' with numbered ident-
ity bracelets before being released. Some were soon found in winter quar-
ters to the south-west in Germany, France and Britain; others turned up
the following spring on their nesting grounds to the north-east in Estonia
and Finland. But origins and destinations of these Latvian birds of passage
would have remained significantly less well-known but for Guntis Graubics
having got on to their wavelength with a sound that the owls apparently
thought was the cry of a bird in distress and thus became easy prey.
Sound recordings of natural environments have come to play a role in
Soviet psychotherapy. The playing of environmental recordings to post-
coronary convalescents is part of the usual pattern of recovery, as it is of
the treatment of patients with neurological problems. Hospitalised children

are also helped in this way. Soviet cosmonauts are similarly soothed in
space by tapes of birdsong, falling rain and rustling trees. In a progress
report on Vladimir Dzhanibekov and Victor Savinykh after two months
in space on board Soyuz T-13, it was said that they had been helped
to overcome nostalgia and the problem of 'cosmic silence' with tape
recordings of Russian nature. 'It is these sounds, so customary to the ear
on earth, sounds that we may not even notice in the hustle and bustle of
daily life, that help cosmonauts in orbit to overcome fatigue', the report
said. Turning to the future possibility of permanently manned space sta-
tions, the report says that specialists were at work on the problems of the
psychological effects of long-term stays in orbit. Wildlife tape recordings
could easily prove a vital factor in reducing homesickness.
For his work in the field of applied bioacoustics, a young Moscow
zoologist, Alexander Tikhonov, was recently awarded the Lenin Kom-
somol Prize. By playing appropriate sounds as hatching time approached
to the embryos of domestic chickens still inside their eggshells, he reduced
by several days the incubation period in the giant industrial incubators,
thus improving productivity. Further, by playing the cackling cry of the
mother hen the chicks emerged more synchronously within 30 minutes
instead of within 24 hours, and thus more incubator time was saved.
We come now to the role of sound recording in the popularisation of
science through disc and cassette, T.V. and radio. Sound recordings are used
in radio programmes in a number of Soviet republics. Sabine's Gull Lams
sabini was the subject of a recent five-minute broadcast on Radio Moscow's
domestic service. IgorD. Nikolsky has broadcast about 75 little talks over
the last 15 years under the title Native Nature. The word-picture about
Sabine's Gull took his listeners to the Chukotka peninsula on the 'home'
side of the Bering Strait, opposite Alaska.
ABC of Nature (Looduse aabits in Estonian) is broadcast in Estonian in
stereo for 10 minutes at 7.10 p.m. on Tuesdays, on the third radio channel.
I have heard No. 39 (of 47 programmes) first transmitted one 31st Decem-
ber. After an introduction, the listener hears a crow cawing three times.
This is the signal for teachers, naturalists and others interested to start
their tape recorders. On this programme we heard the cries and songs of
the Blackbird Turdus memla, Great Tit Pams major, Bullfinch Pyrrhula
pyrrhula and Chaffinch Fringilla coelebs. Anyone with enough persistence
to tape all 47 programmes, over the best part of a year, would have in his
assembled 'radio part-work' the voices of no less than 250 species of bird,
mammal, amphibian and insect.
The deviser and presenter of the series is Fred Jussi, an Estonian
freelance nature writer, photographer and tape recordist. He is utterly
committed to the cause of wildlife conservation and is determined to use

words, pictures and sounds to educate people to this end.Two L.Ps of his,
produced in co-operation with the Estonian Radio, present (i) the natural
sounds of the Matsalu Nature Reserve on the shores of the Gulf of Finland,
famous for its autumn assembly of 10,000 trumpeting Cranes Grus grus
on their way south, and (ii) the aural settings of Estonia's Lahemaa Nat-
ional Park.
The very first phonograph record in the world to present the voice of a
bird was pressed in Riga in 1911. Not surprisingly, the Nightingale Lus-
cinia megarhynchos, the classic European songster, was chosen to make
this technological debut. Since then nearly one hundred discs have been
produced in the USSR.
Some of the discs are for popular use, including those of wild choruses
direct from nature and those from zoos. Others are of educational or
scientific value. One is a major contribution to economic ornithology:
its purpose is bird scaring.
A more direct use of recordings for conservation is the Red Data Disc,
an album that brings together the cries of endangered Soviet creatures like
the Altai Tiger Panthera tigris altaicus, the Snow Leopard Panthera uncia,
and the Hooded Crane Grus monacha. The recording of the crane was
made at the very first nest ever found by a scientist. This was as recently
as 1974 when Yuri Pukinsky, working in the valley of the Bikin river
north of Vladivostock, discovered a nest and tape-recorded the bugling
adults and their hatching chicks. Only in the Soviet Union has the Red
Data Book idea, invented by the British conservationist, Sir Peter Scott,
taken off on phonograph records: bioacoustics in the cause of nature con-
servation.
A series of strictly educational phonograph records was commissioned
by the Soviet Ministry of Education. The accompanying texts are excep-
tionally informative and vital to a full understanding of, for example, the
recordings of the frog and toad language of Russia. One among eight
vocalists is the Fire-bellied Toad Bombina bombina (which clearly has
fire in its belly about something) taped at the Khopyor nature reserve
near Voronezh in the Russian Federated Republic. The record sleeve is
helpfully decorated with colour paintings of the amphibians by Yuri
Smirin. The discs sold for about 75p. each, mainly to schools: bioacous-
tics in the cause of education! Several thousand copies of each were
pressed.
Of more popular discs, no less than 250,000 are pressed. Once a month
there appears on Soviet bookstalls a publication called Krugozor. It is a
combination of lightweight discs, 9cm in diameter and square pages,
9cm x 9cm! Plastic and laminated paper alike have a hole in the middle
and a spiral binding allows discs to be opened like pages, and folded back

for placing on a phonograph turntable. I have not seen a comparable
format in the West. Anyway, most of the disc sides are devoted to music,
a few to speech and effect, and once or twice a year there is a wildlife
sound-article. One such, under the heading 'Concern for the Future',
included the voices of rare birds such as the Crested Ibis Nipponia nippon
and Steller's Albatross Diomedea albatrus, both taped in Japan.
One disc, first produced in 1960 and still on the market, even today,
has sold with its immediate successors under the same series title, two
million copies world-wide in several languages, including English, French,
and Japanese. The series is called The Voices of Birds in Nature and in-
cludes the music of the Eastern Nightingale Luscinia luscinia, and the
fluting of the Golden Oriole Oriolus oriolus\ also the spring croaking of
Marsh Frogs Rana ridibunda. On the 25th anniversary of its publication,
the recordist, friend Boris, appeared on the Soviet fortnightly television
programme In the World of Animals as the guest of his long-standing
friend Vasily Peshkov, the well-known and much respected conservation
writer for Komsomolskaya Pravda (Truth for Youth). This programme,
transmitted at prime time on Saturday evening and re-run twice within
seven days, gets an astounding 92 million viewers, more than any other
wildlife television show on earth. Peshkov and Veprintsev discussed the
amazing volume of sales of the disc (also easily a world record for wild-
life discs) and led on to the importance of all media, television and film,
magazine and book, disc and cassette, in increasing the awareness of wild-
erness values by the proletariat.
Yet another recent Soviet disc is sheer entertainment, and nothing
wrong with that. It also has scientific value, since the ability of Gosha,
a Budgerigar Melopsittacus undulatus to build the astonishingly rich voca-
bulary of several hundred words is of some significance. The bird was
trained from the age of 23 days old and was still picking up new words
at four years old. It can even recite the works of the distinguished Soviet
poet, Chukovsky. Gosha is also reliably reputed to indulge in the kind of
language attributed to parrots brought home by sailors. But none of this
appears on the record.
To date, nearly one hundred discs of natural sound of all kinds have
been issued in the Soviet Union. They sit alongside a rest-of-the-world
record collection in Boris Veprintsev's Soviet Archive of Wildlife Sounds.
Only one man has played the lot. Pavel Mitrofanov, a retired Leningrad
teacher of biology, has spent hundreds of hours not only playing the 500
records but also compiling an index of the 3,000 species that give voice
from their grooves. His wife calls it a 'noisy game'! He has added to the
scientific (usually Latin) names, the Russian names and English names and,
where appropriate, those in French, German and Spanish. Let us hope

that computer print-outs of this incredible lexicon will be made available
internationally.
The catalogue of wwpublished Soviet recordings is already in print.
At the last count, no less than 500 species' voices are held on tape in
the archive. New ones are being added all the time. Indeed, each year
Boris Veprintsev spends eight or 10 weeks in the field with his friend
and colleague Vladimir V. Leonovitch. Over 12 years these two have
visited many parts of the USSR. In 1985 they were in the mountains of
the Caucasus, where they captured on tape the song of Radde's Accentor
Prunella ocularis, a tiny bird of the Alpine zone. It was new to the collec-
tion. In 1983 they had an extraordinary stroke of good fortune. On Saka-
lin Island they taped the distinctive song of a kind of leaf-warbler previous-
ly unknown to science! Looking as it did, it should have been a Pale-
legged Willow Warbler Phylloscopus tenellipes but its voice totally gave it
away. And when some were trapped and examined in the hand, they
were found to have small but significant differences in the shapes of their
primary feathers. The bird has been dubbed Phylloscopus borealoides in
Latin, but awaits its Russian (and English) name. Its voice will appear in
the aforementioned Great Soviet Encyclopaedia of Bird Songs (actually
called 'The Birds of the USSR: a Sound Guide').
By the year 2000, the work will be complete: 750 birds' songs on
25 LPs. That will be 100 hours of playing time for the scientists and bird
buffs (and more than enough, surely, to push up the Soviet divorce rate?).
The work's closest western competitor has only 15 LPs. To his eternal
credit, Boris Veprintsev got the first three discs on to the market in
August 1982, in time for the XVIIIth International Ornithological Con-
gress in Moscow. Visiting ornithologists from the USA and elsewhere
snapped up the records (at only a pound a piece) and were able for the
first time to hear the voices of certain Soviet specialities, birds that breed
in the USSR and nowhere else, like the Spoon-billed Sandpiper Euryno-
rhynchus pygmeus, a delightful little wading bird of the Siberian Arctic
that performs a song flight, rising high into the air and uttering a rhyth-
mical buzzing sound, and the Red-necked Stint Calidris ruficollis, another
shore bird that hangs in the air like a Skylark Alauda arvensis, for 10
minutes or more pouring forth a trilling love song. Then there is the voice
of the Little Curlew Numenius minutus , the Asiatic ecological counterpart
of America's near-extinct Eskimo Curlew N. borealis. The Little Curlew
was the special object of an expedition to remotest Yakutia (east-central
Siberia) by Veprintsev and Leonovitch. The bird was little known and so
special efforts were made to study its ecology and behaviour and to bring
home colour photographs and 16mm colour film, as well as tapes of the
bird's vocabulary. The scientific account was translated into English and

carried in a prestigious western journal, the Ibis. Amazingly this bird was
found to create sounds not only vocally but also by using its body as an
instrument. The male Little Curlew dives through the sky and mechani-
cally creates an impressive sound strongly reminiscent of a jet plane's
whine. A careful examination by me of skins of the species in the Ameri-
can Museum of Natural History showed no specially shaped feathers,
so whether the bird makes the sounds with wings or tail is still unknown.
The Little Curlew appears on the sleeve of its disc as perhaps the
most prized capture on that particular record. The next two discs to
appear have buntings and larks respectively. They were issued in time
for the exhibition of Soviet animal voice discs arranged by Igor D. Nikol-
sky at Moscow's K.A. Timiriazev Biological Museum in December 1986,
celebrating 75 years of Soviet animal voice publication.
It was not, of course, necessary to wait for mechanical means of repro-
ducing animal sounds. Man has created, no doubt for thousands of years,
vocal impressions of birds and with primitive instruments like whistles.
Soviet goose hunters try to lure within range the Greylag Goose Anser
anser by vocally reproducing its call. In Moscow sportsman's shops, along-
side guns and ammunition, special clothing and heavy boots, are displayed
three-dimensional wooden decoy ducks and plastic decoy duck whistles. I
have bought well-made metal 'bird-calls' in Moscow for luring the Hazel
Grouse Bonasa bonasia into the open and thus into the gunsight. At a
much earlier stage, when birth was being given to human spoken languages,
the copying - mimicry - of the sounds of animals gave these animals their
names and hence the language new words. This has been studied by the
Soviet zoo-linguist, Olga Silajewa. Obvious examples are the Russian words
for Cuckoo Cuculus canorus, 'kukushka', for Peewit (Lapwing), 'cheebiss',
for Wigeon Anas penelope, 'sveeyaz', for Quail Coturnix coturnix, 'pere-
pel',
But it was with the advent of mechanical recording, first on disc and
more recently and effectively on tape, that enormous strides have been
made in putting these means of reproducing animal sounds to scientific,
economic and aesthetic use. Now the toast can only be: 'The future of
Soviet bioacoustics in the service of man, coupled with the name of Boris
N. Veprintsev'. Boris has recently been made the first honorary member
of the West's Wildlife Sound Recording Society.
(The author is singularly grateful to Michael G. Wilson upon whose trans-
lations from the Russian this article is partly based. Further, Mr. Wilson checked
the science and syntax of earlier drafts, thus greatly improving what appears above.)

(Hounslow, Middlesex)
Over 100 members and their guests gathered at Chestnut Lodge, Cob-
ham, Surrey, at the kind invitation of Miss Ruth Ezra and Mr. Raymond
Sawyer, President and Vice-President of the Avicultural Society. Apart
from a brief shower, the weather was kind and the gardens and hospitality
superb.
As always, change and innovation were in progress, additional aviaries
were being constructed and species new to the gardens were on view. The
collection is displayed in aviaries and tropical houses, which would be en-
vied by many zoos and bird gardens.
Although comparatively early in the season, some interesting and
unusual breeding results had been achieved. Annual success with Keas had
been repeated, with three young reared. Plumbeous Redstarts had bred for
a second season, with five young independent. A probable first British
breeding has been achieved with Tit-babblers, and Green Wood Hoopoes
have also bred. Azure-winged Magpies, Red-tailed Minlas, Royal, Emerald
and Splendid Starlings all had chicks in the nest.
Species incubating included Golden-heart Doves, Golden-breasted
Mynahs, Red-tailed Laughing Thrushes, Raquet-tailed Treepies, Avocets
and Ringed Plovers. Among the waterfowl collection, Hooded Mergan-
sers had reared young, and Orinoco Geese, which had bred the previous
season, were incubating. Among the birds much admired by the visitors
were Scarlet Ibis, Long-tailed Broadbills, White-collared Bee-eaters, Banded
and Blue-winged Pittas. Other species, too numerous to list, ensured that
there was something for every avicultural taste and interest, from hum-
ming birds to Crowned Cranes.

Introduction
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.9768245625" page_id="58075044"  page_num="163" year="" vol="">
Few species are rivalled by the unique beauty of the Andean Cock
of the Rock Rupicola peruviana. These birds are found in western
Venezuela, through the Andes to Ecuador and Peru, as well as in
Bolivia (Meyer de Schauensee, 1964). The tropical and subtropical
zones are where these elusive birds are found, and most of their
courtship activities are performed in the middle and lower forest
canopies (Snow, 1982).
Andean Cocks of the Rock are protected as a "species of concern"
in Colombia. Although they are not recognised as an endangered
species by CITES (Convention for International Trade in En-
dangered Species) they are not commonly observed in their range.
Their behavioural and physiological requirements are such that only
a narrow ecological niche within that range can support this species
(Lieberman, pers. comm.).
Six zoological institutions currently have these extraordinary birds
in their collections: Zoological Society of San Diego, National

Zoological Park, National Aquarium, Philadelphia Zoological Gar-
dens, Dallas Zoological Park and the Mendellin Zoological Park
(ISIS, 1988). Two have bred them successfully and reared chicks; the
Houston Zoological Gardens starting in 1979 (Berry, 1982) and the
Zoological Society of San Diego in 1988.
Adult management
The Zoological Society of San Diego maintains 3.4 individuals in
the collection. The breeding group is housed in what is known as the
Scripps Aviary, a large planted mixed species walk-through aviary

KENDALL &amp; KUEHLER - COCK OF THE ROCK
(60&amp;apos; x 200&amp;apos;). Lek displays are observed in the summer months,
usually between 3.00 pm and 6.00 pm.
The adult diet consists of anoles Anolis carolinensis , grapes,
blueberries, soaked dog kibble, Zupreem Bird of Prey Diet, papaya,
bananas, apples and Blair's Superpreen as a vitamin supplement.
Roxanthin is also added daily in order to enrich the brilliant orange
plumage.
Artificial incubation
On 16th June, 1988 a single, oblong, white egg was discovered in a
mud nest constructed of dried grass, maidenhair fern and saliva. The
nest was located in a "cave" which serves as a keeper access and
supply area within the aviary. This cave in some ways mimics the
natural nesting areas known for this species; rocky areas found in the
gorges between mountain streams. An adequate supply of mud for
nesting was supplied on a continuing basis in several different areas in
the aviary.
The lone egg was immediately pulled for artifical incubation due
to the risk of egg predation by other bird species in the aviary.
Candling revealed the egg to be fertile and it was placed in a
Petersime incubator, with the dry bulb temperature set at 99*F and
the wet bulb temperature between 86* - 88*F. On 4th July, after 25
days' incubation the chick pipped. After 72 hours in the hatcher,
(98.5*F - dry bulb, 88* - wet bulb) the chick had made little progress
and the decision was made to help the chick out of its shell, in order
to prevent fatigue or even death. On 7th July, 1988, the San Diego
Zoo hatched its first Cock of the Rock.
Hand-rearing protocol
Having never reared a Cock of the Rock at the Zoo's Avian
Propagation Center, excitement and concern mounted over the task
to be accomplished. In the quest for information, it was discovered
that few breeding notes exist in published form. The Houston
Zoological Gardens had successfully reared Cock of the Rock chicks
which had been removed from the nest after a few weeks of parental
care (Berry, 1982; Plasse, pers. comm.). Having generously shared
their information and experiences, it was possible to extrapolate a
successful hand-rearing diet for a one-day-old chick. The initial diet
fed to the chick was as follows:

New food items were gradually introduced by offering one new
item daily, until a variety of foods were in the diet. The purpose of
adding new diet items in this manner was to allow close observation
of the birds&amp;apos; behavioural and physiological reaction to each new food.
The full diet which was ultimately offered to the Cock of the Rock
chick was: Zebra finch breast meat, chicken white meat, papaya,
banana, avocado, soaked Purina cat chow, soaked fig pulp, crickets,
blueberries and beef heart meat. This mixture was fed chunky and
very wet after being soaked in either lactated ringers solution or
Nekton Lory mix. Blair&amp;apos;s Superpreen was used as a vitamin supple-
ment. The hand-rearing protocol was as follows:

For the first 20 days of life, the chick was housed in an aquarium
brooder. A standard ten gallon aquarium was equipped with a
thermostatically controlled coil heating unit (Lyons - #BHA 1081).
Initially the chick was brooded at 95*F. The temperature was
decreased gradually as the bird grew and was adjusted depending
upon the chick's comfort. At day 21 the Cock of the Rock was moved
into a 2&amp;apos; x 2&amp;apos; x 1.5&amp;apos; box brooder thermostatically controlled with a
wafer thermostat. The chick pinned and feathered out in this

x 1.5&amp;apos;. Initially, infra red heat lamps were used for heat, until th
chick was able to be maintained at ambient room temperatur
approximately 75*F.
The weaning cage, with the door open, was eventually placed if
an outdoor aviary, so that the chick could gradually explore it
environment as well as its wings and flying abilities. The bird wa
brought inside the brooder room each evening for safe keeping unt
day 70, when it was felt the chick was fully weaned and ready for th
world.

Comments and problems
Fortunately, there were few developmental or medical problems
while rearing the Cock of the Rock. Artificial incubation parameters
will be changed in the future by lowering the incubation humidity.
This should enable future chicks to hatch out on their own.
On day 6, a small superficial pimple about the size of a pinhead
appeared on the chick&amp;apos;s rump. The pimple was expressed and
cultured. The culture results indicated a heterophyll inflammation
associated with gram positive coccus. There was no indication of a
systemic problem, as the bird appeared normal in all other respects.
Day 15, however, presented an additional pimple, this time on the
chick's pygostyle. The area was cleansed twice daily with Betadine,
for five days after the pimple was expressed. There were no further

skin problems during the chick&amp;apos;s development.
Development continued in a normal fashion until day 49 when,
despite the offering of a tight, shallow nest with sticks, to keep the
legs underneath the bird&amp;apos;s body and the toes gripping, the chick's toes
began to curl inward. Unfortunately in order to determine the
existence of crooked versus curled toe syndrome, histological ex-
amination of the sciatic nerves is the diagnostic technique. Curled
toes can be caused by riboflavin deficiency or incorrect incubation
temperature. Crooked toes can be a genetic tendency aggravated by
substrate, inbreeding and infra-red brooding (Abbott, 1973a; Beer,
1969; Peckham, (1972); NACS, 1977).
In order to improve the toe problem, the infra-red heat lamp was
removed as a heat source for this chick and additional B-vitamins
were added to the diet. After these steps were implemented, the rate

Although some taxonomic authorities continue to classify the
Ocellated turkey under Meleagris , after Linne 1758, it is generally
recognised today as a separate branch of the turkey family and
classified, after Chapman 1896, under Agriocharis. This very colour-
ful and inquisitive bird is to be found in the neotropical region of SE
Mexico, Guatemala and Belize. Native hunting in the area has
recently raised fears about the status of the Ocellated turkey in the
wild and consideration is being given to its future protection level
under CITES. (Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species).
The Ocellated turkey was first seen in England in 1848. Later the
London Zoo acquired three, a present from Honduras for Queen
Victoria in 1857, but had no success in breeding. Although several
attempts were made in the following century, it was not until 1940 in
Leckford Aviaries that success was achieved from birds raised by the
hunter Cordier in Central America. Today, most of the specimens in
captivity can trace their ancestry back to the San Diego Zoo which
pioneered artifical insemination to aid propagation in the late 1940s.
On 24th August 1988, I received a pair of one-year-old, captive-
bred, Ocellated turkeys from Frankfurt Zoo and placed them, with

some trepidation knowing their reputation, in an outdoor aviary
already containing a pair of adult green peafowl, Pavo muticus
imperator. The 330 sq metre enclosure is 2.2m high, covered in UV
resistant 50mm mesh netting and left to grow wild. Each end of the 10
x 33m cage has its own heated hut with perches and automatic
drinkers.
Despite my fears, the Ocellated turkeys acclimatised quickly to
their new environment and there was no evidence of inter-species
aggression. The small food intake of the new arrivals proved to be
quite normal and, although they were partial to the occasional titbit
of apple, tomato or mealworms, they also ate the standard grain
mixture I use for my peafowl and pheasants, as well as the on-site
plant and insect life. As so often with captive-bred species, the male
was quite tame and would feed from my hand, giving me some
(unnecessary) concern about his breeding suitability. The female, in
contrast, was rather shy and would not let me come too close. Apart
from a few traumatic moments when finding clumps of tail feathers
beneath the outside perches in the late autumn, due probably to a
local polecat or marten, and the occasional midnight foray on frosty
nights to shepherd the unwilling birds into a warm hut, time passed
uneventfully into 1989.
We had a very mild winter and by the second week in April the
male was already beginning to display before an apparently indiffe-
rent female. The first week in May was very hot and the cock's
display behaviour reached fever pitch, being directed at anything that
came within range, but still no sign of interest on the part of the
female. I had reconciled myself to disappointment when the first egg
was laid on 7th May under a low windbreak in one corner of the
enclosure where the birds had often spent the night. The 60cm x
46cm oval eggs, cream with chocolate spot markings, were laid daily
until 14th May in a bare minimum of a nest. I removed five eggs in
total, leaving the hen with three to hatch on her own.
In a way, breeders are prisoners of their love for their birds and I
always find it difficult to remove all the eggs from a nest, despite
many unhappy results, feeling that nature should have its chance of
fulfilment. As it was, the hen sat well for three weeks and then lost
two eggs in quick succession to a marauding hedgehog. The disturb-
ance, which took place at night, unsettled the bird so much that the
embryo died in the third egg.
Through my own clumsy handling, the eggs for artificial incuba-
tion were reduced to four and on setting at 19.00 hours on 15th May
weighed 62, 64, 66 and 68g respectively. The Schumacher Vomo 0

Maxi incubator, with an automatic hourly push/pull turning device,
was set between 37.4*C and 37.8*C with a hair hygrometer measured
humidity of 60%. On the 25th day, the eggs were removed and placed
in an identical machine without turning facilities, where the tempera-
ture was reduced to between 37.2*C and 37.6*C with an increased
humidity of 75%. The floor of the hatcher was furnished with a piece
of pile carpet to give the chicks maximum traction and avoid splayed
legs. Shell picking commenced at 11.30 on 27th day and the first chick
hatched at 17.33 later that afternoon. The next hatched at 21.14 and
the last two during the night into the 28th day. Weights recorded at
13.00 on 12th June were 42, 42, 42 and 46g and the average shell
weight was 4.75g.
All of the chicks appeared healthy and were removed to a rearing
box with an infra-red heating bulb, giving a "nest&amp;quot; temperature of
30*C, on the morning of the 29th day. Although the practice is
widespread, I did not feel it necessary to use any disinfectant on the
umbilical cord scar. Water, containing a calcium additive, and turkey
chick pellets were placed in the box.
Because I had read the literature, I was expecting severe feeding
problems and had specially acquired an assortment of mealworms,
maggots and grasshoppers which were also placed in with the turkey
pellets. Initially the chicks showed little interest in the food and had
only increased their average weight by 1.5g by hatchday plus two.
This was thankfully temporary and a rapid growth pattern soon
became evident thereafter; the hatch weight being doubled by the
ninth and trebled by the 14th day. The insect food was certainly
appreciated by the chicks, but they continued to feed quite happily on
the pellets and displayed no adverse reaction when the live food was
discontinued after a few days. Because of the extremely warm
weather, the chicks were placed in an outside rearing cage at three
weeks and the temperature of their shelter hut steadily reduced from
28*C by 1*C every two days until it reached 16*C, equalling our
night-time low.
The chicks were able to flutter by the sixth day and could fly by the
tenth, being increasingly difficult to weigh. The only observable
problem was with the toes of two birds where some were slightly
twisted and bent outwards: toe splints have improved, but not cured
the problem. There was always an observable size disparity, between
the young birds, after the first few days, indicating a probable sexual
difference, although confirmation of this had to wait until physical
characteristics were more pronounced. At seven weeks I commenced
the ringing, using a 20mm inside diameter sealed band, and it proved

possible to identify the largest bird as a male due to the knob-like
protrusion in the middle of his forehead. At that stage the chicks
were moulting and had already assumed the unmistakeable colouring
of their species.
At ten weeks all the chicks were moved into the pen containing
the parents. Initially the mother showed signs of aggression towards
the new arrivals, probably to defend her own hierarchical position,
and pecked each of them repeatedly about the head, although not
drawing blood. Within a few hours this problem appeared to have
resolved itself, the "pecking order" having been established, and the
family settled down to what seems to be a harmonious co-existence.

A survey on the husbandry and captive breeding of Fairy
Bluebirds Irena puella was distributed to 37 North American zoos in
order to compile information on captive management of this species.
Twenty-eight institutions housing the birds responded.
Aviary sizes vary widely, but size does not appear to be correlated
with breeding success. Most Fairy Bluebirds are housed with other
species of birds. This species has used a variety of artificial nest
structures, and has also built natural nests. Photoperiod has a
noticeable effect on the timing of reproduction. Birds exposed to a
natural temperate-zone photoperiod laid between April and August,
while birds exposed to artificially lengthened days for part of the year
laid eggs from April through October. Diets are similar at all zoos.

insects, though it it not certain what portion of the chicks' diets were
composed of these. Fertility of eggs was high, (88%) and incubating
birds were able to hatch 94% of their fertile eggs.
Parents fledged 34% of their offspring, while hand-rearing yielded
a 21% fledge rate. Possible reasons for poor rearing success are
discussed.
The demographics revealed by this survey indicate that Irena
puella is a good candidate for a captive management plan. It would be
relatively easy to manage the captive population in such a way as to
minimise needed infusions of wild-caught birds.
Introduction
The Fairy Bluebird Irena puella is a common species, widely
distributed throughout India and Southeast Asia. At least six geog-
raphically isolated subspecies have been described. (Howard and
Moore, 1980). A popular exhibit and common in zoos, the Fairy
Bluebird is still an unreliable breeder in captivity. This survey
represents an attempt to compile information on husbandry and
elucidate problems associated with captive breeding.

A survey on Fairy Bluebird husbandry and captive breeding was
distributed in September, 1987, to 37 North American zoos reported
to hold Fairy Bluebirds. Twenty-eight institutions housing the birds
responded, and the results were summarised. Husbandry and breed-
ing data from three institutions were incomplete, and had to be
excluded from calculations of fertility, hatchability, and survivability.

Fifty-four male, forty-nine female, and five unknown sex living
birds were recorded for a total of 108 birds. Eighty-two of these birds
(76%) are wild-caught, twenty-one are captive-hatched, and five are
of unknown origin.
Fairy Bluebirds were reported to live as long as eleven years in
captivity, and to produce young as late as their tenth year. The ISIS
SDR Abstract for December, 1987 also shows the oldest captive
Fairy Bluebirds to be eleven years old, and the average age of the 94
birds to be 4.9 years.

high-protein insect substitute such as softbill mix, soaked dogfood, or
birds-of-prey diet. Several institutions add vegetables to their fruit
mix, and one (successful in breeding Fairy Bluebirds) substituted a
canned fruit mix for fresh fruit.
Fifteen of the 28 institutions feed live insects, including all eight
zoos which were successful in producing parent-reared offspring. It
was not clear, however, what proportions of the chicks' diets were
composed of insects. Fourteen institutions use a vitamin and/or
mineral supplement, but use of this item does not appear to be
correlated with breeding success. Only five of the 11 institutions
which successfully reared Fairy Bluebirds reported using such a
supplement.
Housing
Aviary size varies from 32 sq.ft. (2.97 sq.m) for an off-exhibit
propagation area to Wi acres (6050 sq.m) acres for an outdoor
mixed-species flight. Height varies from 7 to 65 feet (2.13 to 20m).
Breeding success does not appear to be correlated with aviary size,
although it is possible that birds in smaller aviaries tend to have better
success raising their young (Table 1). Chicks have been parent-reared
in aviaries from 32 to 2511 square feet (2.97 to 233.27 sq.m), and eggs
were laid in both the largest and smallest aviaries recorded in the
survey.
Most Fairy Bluebirds are housed with other species of birds. In
three cases, pairs were able to rear young in the presence of other
species. Pekin Robins and Hooded Pittas were mentioned as exhibit-
mates in one such situation. In two institutions, Fairy Bluebirds are
housed with reptiles and mammals. One pair of birds in such a
situation laid eggs, although no young were reared.
One zoo houses its Fairy Bluebird pairs in isolation in an
off-exhibit propagation area. Two pairs have been productive layers
of fertile eggs in such a situation, but have reared young from only
four of 43 eggs laid.
Breeding
Eleven institutions reported successful rearing of Fairy Bluebirds.
Five produced at least one parent-reared chick; the remaining six
employed hand-rearing or a combination of the two approaches.
Of the institutions which did not rear Fairy Bluebirds, nine
reported some form of breeding behaviour such as egg-laying,
copulation, or nestbuilding. The remaining eight institutions reported
no breeding activity at all. The majority of birds at these institutions

had been in captivity for less than two years, in contrast to the
successful breeding birds, most of which had been in captivity for
three to ten years.
Photoperiod and Timing of Reproduction
Photoperiods experienced by captive Fairy Bluebirds differ con-
siderably from institution to institution. In general, reported photo-
period types could be divided into the following categories:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997279545454546" page_id="58075055"  page_num="164" year="" vol="">
(1) Natural temperate-zone photoperiod The birds are ex-
posed to only natural light, or, if artificial supplementation is used, it
is on only during daylight hours.
(2) Days artificially lengthened for part of the year The birds
are exposed to natural light, but artificial supplements extend day
length for part of the year (either in the fall and winter or the spring
and summer).
(3) Single fixed artificial photoperiod throughout year The birds
receive artificial light only. "Day" length is the same throughout the
year.
(4) Two fixed artifical photoperiods As above, but a longer
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.991909409090909" page_id="58075055"  page_num="164" year="" vol="">
artificial day is used in the spring and summer.
Table 2 gives a summary of photoperiod information as it corres-
ponds to egg-laying. Because of the small sample size it is difficult to
say which regimen, if any, is the most successful at stimulating
reproductive activity.
When a natural temperate photoperiod was supplied, the birds
always laid between April and August. Artificial lengthening of days
for part of the year, appeared to lengthen the laying season.
Institutions providing longer than natural day lengths in the fall and
winter or in the spring and summer received eggs in April through
October. The one institution using a fixed artificial photoperiod
throughout the year received eggs in July and November, indicating
perhaps, that its birds were laying without seasonality.
Twenty-one institutions reported their birds as building and/or
using nests. Types of nest structures are given in Table 3, and
locations, where reported, are given in Table 4. Birds which did not
nest on the ground chose locations from 6 to 15 feet (1.83 to 4.57m)
above the ground. When the Fairy Bluebirds built a nest unaided,
twigs, grasses, leaves, and pine needles were the materials reportedly
used.

but fledged no chicks. Six captive-hatched birds have produced
offspring. Since none of these bred until their second year, it appears
that Fairy Bluebirds may require two years to reach sexual maturity.

Though many breedings have been recorded. Fairy Bluebirds are
still unreliable producers in captivity. As this survey demonstrates,
they will nest under a wide variety of conditions. The majority of
problems occur during incubation and rearing.
Parent-incubated eggs show a high hatchrate, but the same is not
true for machine-incubated eggs. Though many institutions had
difficulty hatching artificially-incubated eggs, one institution
obtained a 100% success rate with seven eggs incubated at a
temperature of 100.5*F, 86*F wet bulb. Thus, it appears that Fairy
Bluebird eggs may require incubation temperatures slightly higher
than the eggs of other species.
Chick-rearing also presents considerable difficulties, as the low
fledging rates show. Since most Fairy Bluebirds are housed in
mixed-species exhibits, it is easy to blame rearing problems on
interference from other birds. One zoo did report chicks disappearing
in a mixed-species exhibit. However, two pairs of birds kept off-
exhibit in isolation at another zoo also had low-rearing success,
rearing only four chicks out of the 18 hatched. A third zoo has seen a
male Fairy Bluebird killing his offspring, and now places this bird in a
separate cage a few days prior to hatching. It would appear prudent
for zoos to monitor the behaviour of their male birds during
incubation and chick-rearing, separating them if problems appear.
Lack of adequate nestling food, both for parent-reared and
hand-reared offspring may be a problem. Parent-reared birds may be
fed a high proportion of live insects. Commercially-produced crickets
have been shown to be deficient in calcium (Fowler, 1986). It is
possible that the few commercially-available varieties of live insects

provide a poor diet for growing chicks. The calcium deficiency, at
least, could be remedied by feeding the insects a high-calcium diet or
providing insect species, such as fly larvae, with a higher calcium/
phosphorus ratio. It is perhaps significant that the one successful
hand-rearing diet reported in the survey was based on newly born
mice rather than insects.
Several researchers have raised a variety of insectivorous and
frugivorous passerines on a syringe-fed diet with multiple ingredients
(Lanyon, 1979; Mathison, 1988). Perhaps such an approach would be
successful in hand-rearing Fairy Bluebirds.
Experimentation with artificial incubation and hand-rearing can
be extremely time-consuming. Since Fairy Bluebirds use photoperiod
length to time their reproduction, it may be possible for zoos using
artifical photoperiods to encourage their birds to breed during the
winter, thus allowing more time for experimental manipulation.
Fairy Bluebirds are good candidates for a captive management
plan such as a studbook. They are popular exhibit birds, long-lived in
captivity for a small passerine, and their zoo population contains a
high proportion of founders. They are still common in the wild, and
therefore not in need of conservation-directed management. Howev-
er, with some population management and improvement of rearing
techniques, it appears that a genetically balanced captive population
could be maintained with minimal infusions of wild-caught birds.

HAND-REARING THE LESSER VASA PARROT
Coracopsis nigra
By ROSEMARY LOW
(Gran Canaria, Spain)
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.965932" page_id="58075060"  page_num="169" year="" vol="">
The genus Coracopsis contains two species, the Lesser Vasa
C.nigra and the Greater Vasa C.vasa. They are the least typical and
perhaps also the least admired of all parrots, because they are
entirely dull grey. Only those who admire parrots for their personal-
ity or who are intrigued by their behaviour will appreciate the Vasas.
For me they hold a fascination which is equalled by a few but not
surpassed by any other genus.
Vasas were almost unknown in captivity until the early 1980s. The
Lesser has been bred in captivity in four or five collections (at
Chester Zoo in Britain and in private collections in Germany and
Switzerland). I do not know of any published report of the breeding
of the Greater Vasa and would be most interested to hear from
anyone who has succeeded.
Vasas, more than any parrots I know, are sun-worshippers. They
assume exaggerated postures, usually with one wing outstretched and
the tail fanned to one side, to soak up the sun. The climate of
Tenerife, with its many hours of sunshine, suits them very well (me,
too!). At Loro Parque, in a range of four large aviaries for African

species, is one enclosure containing four Lesser Vasas and, next to it,
one for a pair of Greaters. Each aviary measures approximately 9ft
wide x 14ft deep x 9ft high (3 x 4.2 x 3m).
One egg was found in the nest of a pair of Lesser Vasas on 2nd
July 1987 (I was then working at Loro Parque). The box was situated
at a height of about 9ft (3m).
Three eggs were laid. Alas, on 15th July a female was found dead
in the aviary. It happened to be my day off and I did not learn of her
death until about midday, three hours after she was picked up. I
immediately went to investigate the nest. I could feel but not see
inside and removed two eggs before my fingers came into contact
with the shell from which a chick had hatched. A keeper brought a
ladder at once and reached inside the nest. He found a chick. It was
stone cold - yet on its feet. The outside temperature was in the region
of 80*F, 27*C. I placed the chick in an incubator which was operating
at 96*F, 35.5*C. I afterwards realised I should have placed it in a
brooder at a lower temperature. When I removed it to a brooder one
hour later it was continually arching its head backwards; during the
afternoon this behaviour gradually ceased.
The chick was amazingly strong. It was probably its second day of
life; it had been pipping three days previously. Densely covered in
longish white down, it was not a round fluffy ball, like a Grey Parrot
Psittacus but stretched high, like a King Alisterus chick. The shape of
its head and beak were also reminiscent of a King. There is not, of
course, any relationship between the two genera; I mention Alisterus
for comparison only.
Very little indeed had been recorded about the breeding biology
of Coracopsis species, especially the development of the young but
Becker (1987) mentioned the very short incubation and fledging
period. This confirmed what Victorin Laboudallon told me of the
Seychelles sub-species, the Black Parrot C.n.barklyi on Praslin Island
in 1983. When I saw his record card for the only nest for which a
fledging period had been recorded in the wild I felt he had made a
mistake. Could a Vasa spend six weeks or less in the nest and could
the incubation period be less than 18 days?
The answer is yes! I was unable to confirm the incubation period
exactly as only one of the three eggs hatched and the eggs were not
marked as laid. One egg was infertile and measured 35 x 29mm and in
the other the embryo died about halfway through the incubation
period. However, Becker had recorded an incubation period of only
13 Vi days and in our case, there were two eggs in the nest on 2nd July
so possibly the first was laid on 28th June.

that ours would need a diet containing at least 15% protein right from
the start. Contents were as follows:

Assuming that the chick was two days old when taken, at five days
its eyes started to slit. However, Becker stated that his chick's eyes
were slitting at four days. Compare this with 15 or 21 days for most
parrots.
The chick was fed every two hours between 6.30am and 10pm,
plus a midnight and 4am feed until it was six days old. I then cut out
the 4am feed. I was working long hours - also I found it difficult to
get back to sleep again. Only very special chicks can induce me to
leave my bed!
On its third day in the brooder I moved it from a surface of kitchen
towel to welded mesh ( l A in square) because it was bleeding from a
small cut on the edge of the wing. This was almost certainly due to the
bleach used in the paper towel. I have often encountered this
problem which has ceased when chicks have been moved to welded
mesh. This surface is also far superior for the development of their
feet.
On 20th July I observed a phenomenon in this chick which I am
reluctant to record, knowing that others will be sceptical - but it
should be related for the benefit of anyone else who may be fortunate
enough to rear this species. At 7am an organ was protruding about
Vim (1.25cm) from the chick's cloaca. There was a little blood on the
paper which lined the side of its container. I could not believe a
prolapse had occurred because, a) I had never heard of this in a chick
under one week old, and b) it did not look like a prolapsed organ. A
couple of hours later the organ was partially retracted and by noon it
was no longer apparent. The only explanation was that even a six day
old Coracopsis has the ability to protrude its sexual organs. Never
again did this occur. It should be pointed out that Vasa Parrots of
both sexes have this ability, unique among parrots, when in breeding
condition. I observed this many times in my own pair of Greaters and

was very surprised at the large size of these organs.
After this incident the rearing of the Lesser Vasa never caused a
moment s worry. By 23rd July its eyes and ears were open. By 27th
July the white down was still profuse only on the lower back; the
wings were darkening with the growing feathers under the skin. With
its very long neck it was still reminiscent of an Alisterus chick. As well
as the egg tooth on the upper mandible, it also had a V-shaped
projection on the middle of the cutting edge. This can be seen in
some of the photographs I took at the time. Its feet were then dark
grey and the cere was as light as the beak. It had a thin, piping call
and was extremely active, making photography difficult.
By 8th August the scapulars and the feathers of the crown were
erupting. The egg tooth was still visible. By 21st August the young
Vasa was fully feathered, except for the shorter tail. It was five weeks
old and weighed 249g which was to be its adult weight! Then the beak

was still light; it began to darken from the base of the upper mandible
and by the beginning of September was partly dark grey. By the
middle of that month it was entirely dark grey. At the time of writing,
March 1988, it is completely light.
On 20th August the young Vasa was seen eating a pea; it very
quickly learned to feed itself. Green seemed to attract it as peas,
mung beans and alselgar (a large-leaf spinach) were eaten first. It was
extremely fond of alselgar, also peanuts in the shell. It soon ate
almost everything in the normal food which included boiled maize,
boiled peanut kernels, sunflower seed, gorbanza beans (not
favoured), carrot, apple, orange and other fruits in season such as
pear and cactus fruit.
On 20th August the young parrot was moved from brooder to
cage. Almost silent previously, by the beginning of September it was
becoming vocal, making squeaky sounds accompanied by jerky
movements. It preened its breast feathers with quick little pecks like
a pigeon; its plumage was wonderfully soft. Small dark hairs prot-
ruded around the eyes, nostrils and side of the head. At this age it
was gentle except when new food was put in the cage when it would
nip in its impatience to reach it.
It continued to take a little food from the spoon until the
beginning of October but could be considered weaned about three
weeks previously. Below are given the weights in grams of the young
Vasa before and after the first feed in the morning. (Day 3 is assumed
to be 16th July.)

Rearing this Vasa was, for me, an absorbing experience. Probably
the first of its species to be hand-reared, it gave me an insight into the
development of this genus which reinforced my belief that Coracopsis
may be a link between the parrots and the pigeons. I hope to have
this confirmed or disputed before long. Dr Marc Valentine, the
American cytogeneticist, responded to my request for information on
the cytogenetics of Coracopsis with the promise to try to study the
genus in the near future. To date, no one has sent him feather
material for sexing purposes which could have enabled him to study
the chromosomes. An interesting spin-off of Dr Valentine's work of
sexing birds by preparing a culture from a blood feather, is compari-
tive cytogenetics, used to interpret evolutionary relationships. In this
way Dr Valentine will, hopefully, unravel one of the most intriguing
avian mysteries.

OHIO, USA.
By JOSEF H. LINDHOLM III
(Berkeley, California, USA)
The Cincinnati Zoo, established in 1873, probably remains most
famous as the home of the last living Passenger Pigeon and Carolina
Parrakeet, which died in 1914 and 1918, respectively. In recent years,
however, this oldest of Ohio's zoos has attracted international
attention for many activities and achievements under its long-time
Director, Edward J. Maruska, among them an elaborate insect
house, the world's largest captive assemblages of cats and amphi-
bians, a colony of twenty Gorillas, and for pioneering experiments in
cryogenic storage and interspecific transplantation of embryos.
Somewhat less well-known is Cincinnati's collection of nearly two
hundred species of birds, of very high quality and major avicultural
importance. I was therefore most pleased at the opportunity,
afforded during the Fifth World Conference on Breeding En-
dangered Species in Captivity (hosted by the Cincinnati Zoo), to visit
the Zoo repeatedly in the week of 9-13th October, 1988, my first
opportunity to do so.
Cincinnati's imposing Bird House betrays its origins with bas relief
friezes of Giant Tortoises and stylised spiky lizards over its main
doors, sharing with London Zoo's Bird House (Prestwich &amp; Seth-
Smith, 1928) the distinction of having been built to house reptiles.
Completed shortly before America's entry into the Second World
War, this Reptile House was considered one of the most modern in
the world (Anon. 1942). Its conversion took place in the early 1960s,
following the relocation of the reptiles and amphibians to the
nineteenth century, former primate house, after that building's
inhabitants were given new exhibits.
Inside this building, many individual displays still give evidence of
having once been reptile exhibits. The large ponds dominating the
floor of the Hornbill enclosure that fills one end of the hall still house
Chinese and American Alligators during the winter. At the opposite
end of the building, the large glass-fronted exhibit housing a dozen
Rockhopper Penguins, appears, despite its present attempted re-
semblance to a polar landscape, to have once been for large snakes.
Just as obviously intended for reptiles are two banks of five cages
each, at right angles to the penguin display, each unit measuring 2&amp;apos;

Having long been interested in the potential for bird propagation
in small cages, I asked Kevin Hils, a keeper in the Bird Department,
if any breedings had taken place in these "jewel cage" exhibits. I was
amazed to hear that over the years, in addition to expected Zebra,

Society, and Gouldian Finches, Red and Dusky Lories, Forsten's
Lorikeet, Timneh Grey Parrots, Red-fronted Kakarikis, and Sun
Conures were successfully bred there as well! Kevin informed me
that, as at 4th January, 1989, Peter's Twinspots and the Mearn's
Quail were nesting.
At the opposite end of the building was the only exhibit not
glass-fronted, with aviary netting instead. Glass-ceilinged, this large
display housed a pair of Rhinoceros Hornbills, not the straight-
casqued Javan subspecies, but possessing casques with slightly up-
turned points. Two American Alligators, one "Tojo", 9ft long
(2.74m) and more than fifty years old, had just been moved into a
floor pool for the winter. Chinese Alligators were to follow shortly.
This aviary was also inhabited by a White-crested Laughing Thrush
and, so I was informed, a number of Blue-headed Cordon-bleus,
which I did not see. Kevin Hils told me they are not molested, and
hardly ever fly through the netting.
The other exhibits in this building are quite spacious, some
remarkably tall. Along with such American zoo standards as Burrow-
ing Owls, a Green Wood Hoopoe, Blacksmith Plovers, Double-
striped Thickknees, Levaillant's Barbets, Toco Toucans, Roadrun-
ners. Tawny Frogmouths, Nicobar Pigeons, Black-necked Stilts,
Killdeer Plovers, and others, I encountered quite a few surprises.
I believe Cincinnati is the first, and so far only zoo to have bred
three species of Halcyon Kingfishers. The first success was with the
Guam Kingfisher H.c. cinnamomina, the first endangered, non-
passeriform softbill for which a serious cooperative captive-breeding
project has been organised. It is now "biologically extinct" in the
wild, with only a handful of males remaining on their island, a victim,
with all of Guam&amp;apos;s other terrestrial birds, of the Brown Tree Snake
(Boiga irregularis ), accidentally introduced in the 1940s (Bahner,
1988; Weiss, 1989). Cincinnati's breeding pair (Studbook Nos. 26 &amp;
27), were among the original 29 wild-caught founders collected by the
Philadelphia Zoo, which served as "clearing-house" for most of them
(Bahner, 1988). Included in the group of eight birds arriving at
Philadelphia on 31st January, 1986, the third and last shipment from
Guam, this pair was transferred to Ohio on 1st May, 1986 (Bahner
1988). Breeding started in 1987, when a chick hatched on 28th April,
dying 13th May. A chick hatched on 12th June, died four days later.
As the first chick had been parent-reared, this one had been pulled
for hand-rearing (Bahner, 1988). The third and fourth chicks,
hatched 17th July and 19th July, were left with their parents. While
the younger chick died after ten days, the other (Studbook No. 84) is.

as far as I know, still alive, off display, at Cincinnati. A Bronx
Zoo-bred female, received in May 1988, to pair with this bird, sadly
died in August of that year (Bahner, 1988).
On 13th June, 1988 Cincinnati's fifth Guam Kingfisher chick
hatched, and was left with its parents, only to disappear three days
later (Bahner, 1988). Beth Bahner's (1988) Studbook covers hatch-
ings through August 1988 (73 from 1st May, 1985, at six American
institutions). I was thus delighted to hear from Kevin Hils, in a letter
of 4th January, 1989, that "in November of 1988 we hand-reared (I
presume successfully) a male and female". This is especially en-
couraging in that Cincinnati's breeding pair, as mentioned earlier, are
wild-caught. Twenty-one of the original 29 founders were still alive as
of September 1988, when the total captive population stood at 48, in
ten collections (Bahner, 1988),
Cincinnati's breeding pair of White-breasted Kingfishers Halcyon
smyrnensis is likewise maintained off-display, in a spacious cage
adjoining the Guam Kingfishers. On display, however, in October,
were their first three offspring, hatched in February 1988, the first of
their species bred in the Western Hemisphere. This breeding,
achieved with the installation of an artificial mud bank (An "open-
faced box, 0.75m deep, with the open end 1.0m x 1.5m.
mounted on the back wall of the aviary and filled with moist clay, top
soil, sand and spagnum"), is described in detail by David Oehler
(1988), Cincinnati's Head Aviculturist, in the Newsletter of the
American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums. These
chicks were parent-reared. Theirs was the first exhibit seen through
one of the Bird House entrances, and contains a gunnite pool. By the
time of my October visit, a second brood of five had been successfully
fledged, and were housed in the basement. The breeding pair arrived
at Cincinnati in January 1987 (Oehler, 1988). It will be most
interesting to see if these birds continue to be so prolific. I have
reviewed all of the International Zoo Yearbook breeding records for
Halcyon smyrnensis , and have not otherwise found so many chicks
produced in a given year. Frankfurt Zoo had a pair that fledged
chicks continuously from 1964 to 1970, with the maximum number
for one year being four (Zoological Society of London, 1966-1972).
Amsterdam recorded breedings every year from 1982 to 1985; the
next two years in which six chicks were hatched are indicated as years
where at least one of the parents was captive-bred (Zoological
Society of London, 1986-1988). If Cincinnati's pair should have a
similarly long reproductive life, at their present level of fecundity, I
believe, noting the presence of other recently imported birds, that an

American self-sustaining population is a possibility.
The first captive breeding of the Brown-hooded Kingfisher Hal-
cyon albiventris , took place on display, in the same exhibit where, in
October, I saw the breeding pair and the survivor of their second
brood of three, hatched 16th July, 1988, reared by its parents. The
first chicks, hatched 18th and 19th June, 1988, were successfully
hand-reared (Kevin Hils, pers. comm.). This East and Central
African species closely resembles the more commonly seen Grey-
headed Kingfisher H. leucocephala , the most pronounced plumage
difference being H. albiventris&amp;apos;s sandy, instead of chestnut, under-
parts. Another distinction is a definite dark line through the eyes,
creating a boundary between the pale nape and throat and the sandy
brown cap. At the end of a bank of cages, the breeding pair's exhibit
has two windows, forming a corner. Water covers most of the floor of
this display, also inhabited by a male and two female African Pygmy
Geese.
At a right angle to this exhibit was one for three Short-tailed
Green Magpies Cissa thalassina , a species nonexistent in American
aviculture five years ago, but now to be found at Dallas and Denver
as well. (Two chicks hatched at Denver in 1988 (Haeffner, 1988),
perhaps a world "first".) Cincinnati's birds had maintained their
green colour rather well.
Another striking sight were six Coleto Mynahs Sarcops calvus
occupying a single exhibit, most recently acquired. Kevin Hils told
me that pairs would be removed as they formed. A seventh and
eighth bird had already been thus transferred to breeding facilities
behind scenes. On 1st March, 1989, Kevin informed me that a chick
had been recently hand-reared. There are a number of others in the
U.S., six being reared at the Miami Metrozoo in 1987 (Low, 1988). It
may be that this species becomes established.
Cincinnati's inventory for 31st December, 1987 lists 23 Roth-
schild's Mynah's, 18 of them out on loan to seven institutions. The
two on exhibit in the Bird House shared their display with five Larger
Malay Chevrotain or Mouse Deer Tragulus napu , appearing quite at
ease inches from the glass, at the viewer's waist-level, in an enclosure
with limited floor space. Like the flourishing Bronx Zoo herd from
which these specimens are descended, it seems they thrive under

close quarters. The first Cincinnati birth occurred on 6th February,
1987 (Brady, 1987). The fawn was reared by its parents.
The other Bird House exhibit shared by mammals housed three
Desmarest&amp;apos;s Fig Parrots Psittaculirostris d. desmarestii and five of the
endangered Pen-tailed Bettong or Rat Kangaroo Bettongia penicillata

(also descended from Bronx Zoo stock and likewise reproducing in
this display, which is quite long).
Less than a decade ago. Pheasant Pigeons were not seen in
American Zoos. Today, the Green-naped Pheasant Pigeon Oti-
diphaps n. nobilis may be seen at Albuquerque, Miami, San Diego
(where it was bred), and elsewhere, but the only publicly exhibited
White-naped Pheasant Pigeons O. nobilis aruensis of which I am
aware are at Cincinnati, where two pairs were listed on 31st
December, 1987. I found two birds exhibited in a display by
themselves. One had a notably longer tail.
Very much in evidence was a number of Tanzanian birds,
commercially imported in 1988. A Snowy-headed Robin Chat Cos-
sypha niveicapilla and a Hildebrandt's Starling Spreo hildebrandti
shared an aviary with a male and two female Black-winged Red
Bishop Weavers Euplectes hordeacea , a beautiful species frequently
illustrated in books on cage birds, but hardly ever seen in the flesh.
Another male shared a very large, arid aviary with three Golden-
breasted Starlings Cosmopsarns regius , likewise received in 1988,

and Double-striped Thickknees, Crested or Levaillant's Barbets (the
female hatched at the Pittsburgh Conservatory Aviary), a White-
headed Buffalo Weaver, a Golden Weaver Ploceus subaureus , and a
West Nile Red Bishop Euplectes orix franciscana.
Other noteworthy Bird House exhibits included an aviary with
three species of Parrot Finches Erythrura hyperythra , E. psittacea , &amp;
E. trichroa , kept with two Nicobar Pigeons, a South American
community display featuring, among other species, a male Bolivian
Cock-of-the-Rock Rupicola peruviana saturata , true Saffron Finches
Sicalis flaveola, a Black-necked Aracari Pteroglossus aracari , and an
American Golden Plover, individual displays for pairs of African
Grey Hornbills Tockus nasutus , Stella's Lorikeets (one was melanis-
tic), and Guam Rails (chasing each other about with spread wings),
and a cage shared by a pair of Blue-winged Pittas Pitta moluccensis
and four Silver-eared Mesias (a very common bird in American
aviculture at present, but nonexistent five years ago).
Most of the aviaries were earth-floored and planted with Aroids,
Euphorbias, and other plants. Each bird was identified with beauti-
fully painted labels, among the most attractive I have seen anywhere.
As impressive as the Bird House's public exhibits were, I disco-
vered as noteworthy a collection in this building's enormous base-
ment, and behind the displays. I am most grateful to David Oehler
and Kevin Hils for a thorough tour of these areas.
Together in one holding cage were the five White-breasted
Kingfishers from the second hatching, and the two male Brown-
hooded Kingfishers from the first clutch, a wonderful sight. Seven
African Grey Hornbills, hatched in 1988, occupied another cage.
The breeding pairs of White-breasted and Guam Kingfishers
occupied adjoining aviaries 2.5m x 2.0m and 3.0m in height, with
potted palms. A nearby cage held a pair of Rothschild's Mynahs and
Guam rails Rallus owstoni. Numbering in the tens of thousands in the
1960s, the Guam Rail is probably now extinct in the wild (Derrick-
son, 1987; Weiss, 1989), destroyed by Brown Tree Snakes. From
1983 to 1986, 21 wild Rails were collected, and 29 wild-caught and
captive-bred specimens exported to the National Zoological Park's
Conservation and Research Center, in Virginia, and the New York
Zoological Park (Derrickson, 1987). While offspring were sent from
New York to the Pittsburgh Conservatory Aviary and the San Diego
Zoo (which had previously bred the species), the first specimens to
leave the National Zoo's collection went to Cincinnati (Derrickson,
1987), where a pair arrived 17th September, 1986. Their first egg was
removed for incubation 29th December, 1986 (Anon., 1987). Kevin

Hils informed me that, by January 1989, three true pairs had been
reared at Cincinnati. The propagation of greater numbers has been
discouraged, pending "completion of DNA fingerprint analyses" to
determine the genetic variability and relatedness of the now more
than 120 birds in eleven U.S. institutions (Weiss, 1989). Once the
representation of various genes has been determined, intensive
propagation will resume, with the aim of shortly introducing a large
stock to the snake-free island of Rota, near Guam.
Very intensive propagation was going on nearby, with several
pairs of Masked Bobwhites, maintained, like Japanese Quail, in
several tiers of laboratory cages, with troughs in front for the eggs to
roll into! I was told this setup presented "no problem whatever". I
counted at least five eggs in the trough. The very distinctive Masked
Bobwhite Colinus virginianus ridgwayi , long extinct in Arizona, and
likely so in its Sonoran range as well, now exists primarily as a colony
at the U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife's Patuxent Wildlife
Research Center in Maryland. This group is prolific; 6,853 eggs were

laid in 1976 (King, 1981). It is intended to eventually reestablish this
subspecies in its former U.S. range, but I am not yet aware of any
permanent success. A number of surplus birds have been sent to
zoos, but Cincinnati appears to be the only one, at present with a
concerted propagation programme of its own. There were 16 speci-
mens in the collection 31st December, 1987.
In different areas in the basement, and behind the exhibits on the
main floor, steel-framed wire-floored cages were suspended above
the floor, in three sizes; 3&amp;apos; x 2Vi&amp;apos; x 5&amp;apos;,3&amp;apos; x 3&amp;apos; x 7&amp;apos;, and 4&amp;apos; x 4&amp;apos; x 1&amp;apos;
(0.91 x 0.76 x 1.52m, 0.91 x 0.91 x 2.13m and 1.22 x 1.22 x
2.13m). They housed a variety of birds in holding and breeding
situations; Two male Magnificent Birds of Paradise Diphyllodes
magnificus , both still in juvenile plumage, Dusky Lories, Blue-
streaked Lories Eos reticulata , Red Lories E. r. rubra , Chattering
Lories Lorius g. garrulus , Sun Conures, two pairs of Golden or
Empress of Bavaria Conures, a pair of Grand Eclectus Eclectus r.
roratus, Scarlet-chested Grass Parrakeets, a Black-mandibled or
Wagler's Toucan Ramphastos ambiguus, Rothschild's Mynah's, Su-
perb Starlings, and other parrots.
Kevin Hils provided me with a list of species bred in these simple,
rather exposed cages; Red and Dusky Lories, Forsten's Lorikeets
Trichoglossus haematodus forsteni , Timneh Grey Parrots, Peach-
faced Lovebirds, Eastern Rosellas, Scarlet-chested Grass Parrakeets,
Sun Conures, and Rothschild's Mynahs. Ruppell's Parrots and
Golden Conures laid eggs, but none hatched.
The Zoo's third pair of Golden Conures occupied different
quarters in the basement, along with quite an assortment of other
parrots. Some of the more notable of these included a magnificent
Palm Cockatoo that might possibly be Probosciger aterrimus goliath ,
Salmon-crested Cockatoos (quite recently declared a severely en-
dangered species), an Alder Amazon Amazon tucumana , Swainson's
Lorikeets Trichoglossus haematodus moluccanus , Green-naped
Rainbow Lorikeets Tr. h. haematodus , Hyacinth, Scarlet, and
Green-winged Macaws, and two breeding pairs of Blue and Gold
Macaws, with two offspring hatched 1988 (Eight hatched in 1986
[Anon., 1987]).
A pair of Pesquet's or New Guinea Vulturine Parrots Psittrichas
fulgidus , returned a year before from the Los Angeles Zoo where
they had been on loan, occupied one of a series of large, stainless
steel aviaries in a specially air-conditioned basement room for

me that the Pesquet&amp;apos;s Parrots were currently nesting, their second
time this year. The two eggs laid at their first attempt were infertile.
Other birds in this room, in October, 1988, were a female Javan
Rhinoceros Hornbill Buceros rhinoceros sylvestris, its short straight
casque in contrast to those of the birds upstairs, three Plate-billed
Mountain Toucans Andigena laminirostris , then in the collection for a
year, two Magpie Geese, and a pair of Southern or Leadbeater's
Ground Hornbills which had ventured once too often from their
Antelope House enclosure.
Other interesting birds in the Basement included the last Lesser
Yellow-headed Turkey Vulture Cathartes burrovianus in the U.S.,
still a most elegant bird after more than 20 years at the Zoo, a 1988
Malay Argus Pheasant, a Red-billed Toucan Ramphastos tucanus ,
and a duck-brooder full of young North American Ruddy Ducks,
ready to go to other collections. The Zoo's incubators are kept in the
Bird House office.
Outdoors, on the terrace of the Bird House, are two large cages
with extensive gunnite rockwork housing, respectively, a male and
female Andean Condor, on loan from the Patuxent Wildlife Center,
where the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been breeding them for
years.
Before the conversion of the Reptile House, Cincinnati's Bird
House consisted of a string of seven square limestone block buildings,
with ornate "Chinese pagodah" roofs, interconnected with outdoor
flights (Anon. 1942). ("Chinese Birdhouses" appear to have been a
pre-WWI style - The large Bird House still at the Franklin Park Zoo
in Boston, built before 1915 [Hornaday, 1915], recalls a Sung
Dynasty Palace.) I believe this was the location of the first U.S.
breedings of the Eastern Blue Jay and the Red Avadavat or
Strawberry Finch, attributed (without dates) to Cincinnati Zoo by
Crandall (1917).
The last of these buildings remaining is now a museum dedicated
as a memorial to its two most famous inhabitants; "Martha", the
world's last Passenger Pigeon, who died 1st September, 1914, and
Incas , the last Carolina Parrakeet, who died 21st February, 1918
(Getz, Wachs, et al , 1986). Along with mounted specimens, photo-
graphs, Audubon prints, and presentations on other extinct animals,
there are enlarged reproductions of contemporary newspaper
accounts of the last Passenger Pigeon, from which I gained much
information. I believe the misconception still persists that "Martha"

was hatched at the Cincinnati Zoo, in 1888, according to the Zoo's
1942 Guidebook (Anon., 1942), or at least lived there continuously
for more than 25 years (Mann, 1930, gives a figure of 28 years). From
one of the newspaper clippings, I learned that "Martha" actually
arrived at Cincinnati in 1902 from a private collection in Chicago. I
imagine the breeder was Professor C.O. Whitman, who, in his
Chicago aviaries is credited (without dates) by Beebe &amp; Crandall
(1919), as the first "Eastern United States" propagator of not only
the Passenger Pigeon, but 26 other species of pigeons and doves as
well. I imagine this record certainly applies for the entire country.
I am not certain whether the four pairs obtained by Cincinnati in
1877, mentioned in one newspaper account, are the same eight birds
purchased from a Wisconsin collector, for $2.50 each, mentioned by
another. At any rate, the first clipping reports that the largest number
ever maintained there was 13. I found no statistics for 1902, the year
of "Martha's" arrival, but in 1907, she was the only female, two males
remaining, the last of which died in 1910. (Edey, 1964, states the total
captive population in 1908 was seven.) I did not find any clear
indication, from the clippings, that Passenger Pigeons actually hatch-
ed at Cincinnati.
Another persistent misconception is that the last Carolina Par-
rakeet died in 1914, the same year as the last Passenger Pigeon. I did
not note much historical information on the Parrakeet at the memo-
rial museum, but a thorough coverage of Cincinnati's last specimens
can be found in McKinley's article (1977) in this journal. "Incas" in
fact died 21st February, 1918, having survived "Lady Jane", the
next-to-last specimen, by only a few months. They were the last of at
least eight birds purchased in the late 1880s. There were still eight
birds at Cincinnati in 1912, when two of these were sold to the New
York Zoological Park. The last of New York&amp;apos;s birds died 25th May,
1913 (Crandall, 1945). By 1916, only two of Cincinnati's birds were
still alive (McKinley, 1977).
While there does not appear to be any evidence of Carolina
Parrakeets hatching there, it should be kept in mind, that in common
with too many other American zoos, Cincinnati went through a time
when records were regarded casually. Among other results, was a
letter received in 1959 by McKinley (1977), from the Zoo&amp;apos;s Public
Relations Department, to the effect that there was no clear evidence
of Carolina Parrakeets ever being kept there!
The Cincinnati Zoo&amp;apos;s concerted, if unsuccessful, attempts to
perpetuate Passenger Pigeons and Carolina Parrakeets are a reflec-
tion on its own strong early avicultural affiliations. Dr. Edward J.

Maruska, the Zoo's Director, informed me that Andrew Erken-
brecher, a founder of the Zoological Society, in 1873, and its first
Treasurer, was very much the nineteenth century German avicultur-
ist, and also founded an acclimatisation society which imported
Starlings, House Sparrows, and other less successful species. Erken-
brecher also imported a German animal dealer, Sol Stephan, as the
Zoo&amp;apos;s General Manager. Stephan, who lived to be 101, presided over
the deaths of Martha and Incas , and supervised the shipment of
"Martha", in an enormous block of ice (depicted in the memorial
building), to the Smithsonian Institution, where her mounted re-
mains are a favourite exhibit. His son Joseph succeeded his father
upon retirement, and also served the Zoo many years. In its early
years, the Cincinnati Zoo was practically a German institution -- its
first guidebook was printed only in German, and it served, before the
First World War, as the American Base of Operations for Carl
Hagenbeck s great animal dealing firm. The Zoo only became City
Property (with the Zoological Society maintaining administration),
on 1st January, 1933 (Anon., 1942).
Quite aside from the Bird House, an impressive collection of birds
is exhibited in a variety of exhibits around the Zoo's 32 acres. It was
my privilege to discuss many of these displays with Dr. Maruska, as
well as Steve Romo, Supervisor of Hoofed Mammals, and Michael
Dulaney, Supervisor of Small Mammals, Carnivores, and Primates,
both of whom also have associated birds under their jurisdiction.
Sharing the enclosure dominated by the wonderful breeding group
of Central African Giant Eland Taurotragus derbianus gigas and
several Damara Zebras, were two Marabous, a Ruppell's Griffon
Vulture (since sent to the San Diego Wild Animal Park), three Eared
or Lappet-faced Vultures, Egyptian Geese, eight East African
Crowned Cranes, and a pair of Kori Bustards. In a nearby exhibit
with a large pool, four Saddle-billed Storks, that arrived with the
Kori Bustards from Tanzania in 1987, were kept with three Wattled
Cranes, hatched at Brownsville, Texas, to be eventually paired with
unrelated stock. A pair of Manchurian Cranes Grus japoncnsis ,
hatched at the San Diego Wild Animal Park, of both Chinese and
Japanese ancestry, were housed with Chilean Pudu Pudu pudu , the
world&amp;apos;s smallest deer. A third is on loan to the nearby King's Island
Wild Animal Park, where it roams a large Asian exhibit. Further San
Diego specimens were expected shortly. This already most impress-
ive collection of Park Birds was enhanced in February, by the arrival
of a Shoebi 11, or Whalehead, of which Kevin Hils informed me. It
came in with the groups received by San Antonio and the San Diego

The collection of nearly 30 species of waterfowl on the large
fountain-dotted "Swan Lake" is particularly representative of the
tribe Mergini. The 31st December, 1987 inventory lists three Buffle-
head Bucephala albeola , nine Barrow's Goldeneye B. islandica, and
seven American Goldeneye B. clangula americana. All breed here. I
was surprised to find four pairs of American Goosanders Mergus
merganser americanus listed, as well as the same number of Hooded
Mergansers M. cucullatus (breeding), two male Smew M. albellus,
since joined by two females, and two Red-breasted Mergansers M. s.
serrator. The lake supports a population of fish, which, Dr. Maruska
told me, afforded the successful maintenance of donated Pied-billed
Grebes Podilymbus podiceps in the past.
The lake is surrounded, not by a wall or fence, but a variety of
vegetation, providing abundant nesting shelter. On 30th May, 1986,
Zoo gardeners retrieved, for incubation, ten eggs of the West Indian
Tree-Duck Dendrocygna arborea , as well as three eggs each of
American Wood Duck, Bufflehead, and Hooded Mergansers
(Anon., 1987). In a winter holding area, in the labyrinthine basement
of the Gorilla House (which also houses two species of African Mole
Rats, and 17 Japanese Giant Salamanders, among other things),
Michael Dulaney showed me a large flock of West Indian Tree
Ducks.
In a tributary of the lake, near the islands for White-cheeked
Gibbons and Siamangs, was a small flock of flamingoes, mostly
Chilean, with two Carribean and a Lesser as well. At the nearby Joe
H. Spaulding Children's Zoo, I found a gunnite outdoor exhibit for
Magellanic Penguins, near the new Walrus enclosure, and American
Magpies Pica pica hudsonia kept with Northern Burrowing Owls
Speotyto cunicularia hypugaea , as part of a desert complex.
A desert exhibit, featuring Masked Bobwhites Colinus virginianus
ridgwayi and Cactus Wrens Campylorhychus brunneicapillus couesi,
with three Marine Toads Bufo marinus , was an unexpected feature of
the insect house - One of a series of displays entitled "What Eats
Insects?", which also included Archer Fish Toxotes jaculator , Goliath
Frogs Gigantorana goliath , Goeldi's Monkeys Callimico goeldii, and
other species. Cactus Wrens are, so far as I know, the only Wrens to
be seen in American Zoos, otherwise displayed, to my knowledge, at
Tulsa, Oklahoma, and the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, at
Tucson (where they have repeatedly bred). Cincinnati's two birds
were tame and very much at ease among the artificial rocks and
ledges in their large glass-fronted enclosure, made to resemble a

dried-out creek-bed. I thought their eyes remarkably small in propor-
tion to their size.
In the spacious, very densely planted, walk-through "Butterfly
Rain Forest", the first of its kind in America, I did not see the four
Ruby-throated Hummingbirds Archilochus colubris or three Rufous-
tailed Hummingbirds Amazilia tzacatl that have been there well over
a year, but a beautiful male Grey Peacock Pheasant Polyplectron
bicalcaratum perched on a branch over the path was prominent. He
seemed oblivious to the Dryas julia and Heliconius charitonius
Butterflies fluttering around him, but an insect keeper told me
dismembered wings are occasionally found beneath his perch -- never
enough to prompt fus removal. This species is propagated elsewhere
at the Zoo.
The central unit of a huge, steel-framed and gunnite-backed
three-cage Pheasant Aviary, at the south-eastern perimeter of the
zoo, was empty, probably for the winter. The other two well-planted
cages, however, were occupied, respectively, by Satyr Tragopans and
Malay (nominate subspecies) Argus Pheasants, both currently
breeding.
A male Green Peafowl (listed as the nominate Javan subspecies),
was a striking feature of the steel-framed, out-door, walk-through
aviary, full of Sycamors, where I also saw eight Scarlet Ibis, four
Waldrapp, Cattle Egrets (which breed), a Mute Swan, a Satyr
Tragopan, Asian Purple Gallinules Porphyrio poliocephalus, a
Laughing Gull Lams atricilla , Spotted Pigeons Columba guinea , and
two Wagler's Toucans Ramphastos ambiguus.
A huge suspension-netting aviary of the "telephone-pole" sort
popular in American Zoos since the 1970s, once housed a "stamp
collection of birds of prey, but now holds only a breeding pair of
Southern Bald Eagles Haliaeetus l. leucocephalus, whose offspring
have been released in Ohio and Tennessee (Getz, Wachs, et al 1986).
Of similar importance is the pair of American Barn Owls Tyto
alba pratincola exhibited in the Nocturnal House in the midst of a
wonderful collection of prosimians, bats, and other mammals. The
breeding activities of these birds has been well described by Michael
Dulaney (1986). At the time his article was published in this
magazine, this pair had "successfully hatched and reared
some 70 young". By October 1988, the figure stood at 87. At my visit,
Michael pointed out a chick, with the pair, in their glass-fronted,
blue-lit 8 x 12&amp;apos; x 12&amp;apos; (2.44 x 3.66 x 3.66m) display, very
convincingly made to resemble a corner of a barn, with farm
implements on the wall, and hay bales on the floor. The female and

chick were in a corner, on the floor, with no nest at all. (Though
nesting often takes place on the floor, it may also take place in the
hay-loft, several feet above the floor). The male and female arrived
in March, 1980, from Louisiana and South Carolina respectively,
commenced breeding in 1981, and have produced at least two
clutches a year ever since.
Though still wide-spread, the American Barn Owl is, for a number
of reasons, much rarer, in many places, than formerly, and, is some
cases, locally extinct. I remember a morning&amp;apos;s Ornithology class
excursion, in Northern California, in 1984, when six or seven
"road-killed&amp;quot; Barn Owls were retrieved along a rather short stretch
of road, all struck by cars in the dark, presumably while chasing
rodents. Michael Dulaney (1986) wrote that, while some of the
off-spring had been sent to zoos, and nature centres, "the great
majority&amp;quot; were released in Ohio and Indiana. At present, he told me,
half are liberated, the others going to zoos, where the demand is
high. Cincinnati Zoo has also released captive-bred Killdeer Plovers
Charadrius vociferus (Anon., 1987).
The other bird exhibit in the Nocturnal House was once a broom
closet and is serviced from the front, the window also serving as a
door. It houses a pair of Screech Owls Otus cisio of the red phase
which has so far laid eggs, but not yet hatched any.

REMINISCENCES OF RARE MUNIAS

{Continued from previous issue)
THE HOODED MUNIA Lonchura spectabilis has been in my
collection for three years and my fortunes have been mixed but
despite serious breeding attempts each year no eggs were ever
hatched. There are four races, the nominate comes from the island of
New Britain and has given the species its common name of New
Britain Munia. This is unfortunate as the race we have received in
England is L.s. mayri from Papua New Guinea. It is a small munia,
about 95mm, exquisitely proportioned, lively and curious. It does
much better in my experience in a birdroom or aviary than in a cage,
but in the case of the latter it does depend on circumstances as I'll
explain later.
THE NEW BRITAIN MUNIA L.s. spectabilis has the head
black, merging into the chocolate-brown back. The wings are also
chocolate-brown. The rump and uppertail-coverts are reddish-gold,
with a slight yellowish fringe to the longer coverts and the two central
tail feathers. The throat, breast, belly and flanks are creamy-white,
cream in fresh plumage, and may well be washed and flecked with
brown in first adult plumage. The undertail-coverTs are black. The
bill is pale blue-grey, the legs and feet variable - grey to blackish. The
sexes are absolutely alike in plumage. Juveniles are typical warm
brown above, buffish below. They very soon show some black on the
head.
MAYR'S MANNIKIN, or MAYR'S HOODED MUNIA L.s.
mayri (Fig. 10). has a noticeably smaller bill, the upperparts are a
lighter brown and are cut off cleanly from the black of the head; the
rump and uppertail-coverts are paler, more yellowish. The Hooded
Munia L.s. wahgiensis is like L.s. mayri but is duller above rump and
tail straw-coloured, but very pale. L.s. gajduseki is darker than the
other New Guinea races and has the breast deep buff.
It is a common bird of mid-mountain grasslands, and apparently is
very easy to catch. (Not so in my bird room!) It settles in quickly and
well and is easy to maintain in good health on a simple all-seed diet.
Derek Goodwin mentions that Immelmann recorded grass pollen as
being most important in their diet. While on a visit to Turkey I went

out of my way to obtain some 21bs of fine grade pollen and looked
forward to the birds' response. Not only would the Hooded Munias
not touch the pollen, no other bird would either. I tried it dry,
softened with water, honey, and mixed some (successfully) in my
home-made softbill universal food. Most of it went into our home-
made muesli. I met Immelmann in Australia a few years ago and
asked him about the pollen. He told me it was simply that he had
observed the Hooded Munias, when faced with a choice, feeding on
flowering grass heads in preference to grass in any other state. In this,
he pointed out, they are no different from any other munia.
Neff was apparently very successful in breeding the species in
Germany, recording that his wild-caught birds reared their young
entirely on seeds, soaked seed and chickweed, etc., not taking any
livefood. Subsequently his captive-bred birds freely took mealworms,
ant pupae and egg food.
My first experience was with three birds from Germany, presum-
ably wild-caught stock for they came with the Black Munia, Grand
Munias and some Chestnut-breasted Munias L. castaneothorax shar-

pii. They were duly colour-banded and placed in a large flight cage
with two small Ficus benjamina in it. They turned out to be three
females. It was 18 months before I was able to find more birds. Tess
Hisley had three in a shipment from Germany, and I snapped them
up. I took each bird from the transit box banded it, measured it, and
released it into the 2m long breeding cage where the three females
were. By pendulum (yes, the old gypsy sex-divining trick) and culmen
I judged two be males. Each burst into song within seconds of landing
next to the incumbents. The third bird was "sexless" and did not sing.
A few months later he showed himself to be a male, as I did see him
sing.
The song is a typical malacca -type song, but is first noticed (by my
middle-aged ears) by a very high pitched weee. An enthusiastic,
promiscuous male, engaged in opportunistic courtship, will sing with
body mainly upright, head turning from left to right with a slight
bobbing of the head. The throat is pumping and the whistle becomes
pulsating.
In advertisement display a male will begin singing with the bill
opening and closing, and a slight hint of bobbing (no turning or
twisting) but it soon becomes virtually motionless. When the female
is alongside, the head feathers are erected and the body is filled out.
The male edges towards the female with little hops, and bends
towards her. The last part of the song, has the male leaning forward
more, with the bill held open; there is no noticeable movement and
the song is a continual high-pitched trill, (Fig 11.)
The 2m breeding cage was built to be partitioned but I only use the
slide when I need to catch a bird (Fig 12). Each male took possession
of a nest as it came into breeding condition and would sit on guard at
the entrance. The first was an Australian Finch Society half-open box
with a perch, hanging on the door. Next to go was a half-open
cardboard box with a wire mesh roof at the other end of the cage.
Finally the "sexless" male took the basket in the middle. The six birds
were happy and lived in a very peaceful community. Eggs were laid in
boxes 1 and 3, but were clear and were eventually deserted. Filled
eggs were laid but were deserted. The roof of this cage was the
reeded, heavy duty perspex roof of the bird room and I discovered it
was the favourite trysting ground of the local cats, and was a short cut
for them from one garden to the other. I removed the cage fronts and
allowed the birds the run of the bird room and access to the aviary. In
the aforementioned disaster of the children on the roof of the flight,
two females escaped. All this happened in the spring of 1988. That
summer Ron Miller brought in some rare New Guinea Munias, and

among others I took four Hooded Munias. Ron was very cooperative
and I was able to separate the birds each to its own cage, and listen to
the call notes. I chose two pairs that were of different tones and, sure
enough, had selected two cocks and two hens.
These birds were banded, and released one at a time. This time in
contrast to when I released birds before, the resident birds were
mostly male and the contrasting behaviour is worth noting. The first
bird out was immediately raped by first one male and then another.
The poor bird, a female by my analysis, was then allowed to sit
among the group (looking somewhat cowed, I thought). The same
routine happened with the second bird. The third bird resisted, I had
decided it might be a male. It was sung at in high intensity by one of
the resident males who attempted to rape it but failed. For some
reason I failed to note down what happened with the fourth bird
(lesson: keep up-to-date notes).
The flock immediately became the dominant species in the
collection by virtue of their boundless zip and energy. They would
stand up fearlessly to any of the other munias, despite being the
smallest. Only the Timor Sparrows, 50% larger, commanded respect.
Often, four or five of them would gather on top of a nesting terrace
and sit peacefully resting up.
In this situation one or other male would stand up and would sing,
undirected, head level, bill open. After pumping up several weee he
would produce up to 25 or 30 peee one after the other.

A bonded pair stay very close to each other, the male standing
sentinel, very alert, while his mate feeds, waiting for her to bathe
first. When she flies off he follows immediately. At talks I've given to
clubs around the country I've often mentioned what an old bird hand
in Australia told me about sexing Red-headed Parrot Finches. "It's
easy, he said "the female flies off first, and the male follows. If your
birds are banded you can soon build up a list of what's what." This
has always produced derisive chuckles from the audience. However,
it's true of most if not all the munias, parrot finches and grass finches
I've studied and been able to identify pairs. Another way to tell
pair-bonded L. spectabilis is that the male, perched close to his mate
will sing to her low intensity, leaning forward not standing upright,
followed by the male preening the female. I have not recorded
mutual allopreening in this situation, that is to say, I've never seen
the female return the attention. At the time of writing (December
1988) two pairs are actively nesting in the birdroom.
THE TIMOR SPARROW Lonchura (Padda) fuscata is a particu-
lar passion of mine. I first saw them, about 40 adult birds, in a couple
of cages in a holding station in Jakarta in June 1987. They were being
fed on plain paddy rice but seemed to be in good condition with tight
glossy plumage like that of the Java Sparrow. Later that year an
importer received a shipment direct from Jakarta, the only direct
importation to my knowledge, other birds reaching England via
Germany. I took three pairs, three birds in adult plumage and three
immature. On being released into a large, all-wire holding cage, so
that I could observe their behaviour and control their food, they were
at once all over the mixed grit and the plain paddy. Very soon they
were taking mealworms, lettuce and slices of orange. Within a week
they were taking the foreign finch mix (mostly millets), my own
special oily and long seeds mix, and millet on the spray. With the
widening of their diet however, they would no longer take paddy, nor
lettuce nor orange, but would still nibble at apple and pear. Meal
worms were ignored now.
I divided them into two cages, adults in one and juveniles in the
other, but this was not successful. The adults bickered all the time,
the young birds were moulting and simply sat around somewhat
fluffed and not looking too good. A month later I released all six into
the birdroom (without access to the indoor flight nor outside), and
was able to observe their behaviour as a flock.
It is a large munia, some 130mm long. The adult has the entire
head black with a large, white check patch. The lower throat, upper
breast and entire underparts are a cold brown; tail black. The lower

breast and rest of underparts are white, separated from the brown
breast by a black line. The bill is pale blue-grey, the legs and feet pale
vinous-grey. The sexes are alike and despite knowing my males and
females by band colour, I've never been able to note any reliable
visual sexual difference. After careful observations of two proven
pairs it seems that males are darker and glossier, the females browner
on breast and mantle. This is looking at very healthy, fresh-plumaged
birds (Fig 13). The juveniles are greyish-brown above, pale greyish
brown below. The lores are dark. To the best of my knowledge this is
the only juvenile munia with dark lores.
My original six turned out to be four males and two females. The
two females were soon paired up and I caught up the two odd males. I
obtained the three remaining birds from a shipment bought in from
Germany and was fortunate to receive two hens and a cock bird. Out
of these three and my two odd cocks I kept the best pair and
exchanged the three left over for some Dickcissels and Clay-coloured
Sparrows. So I had three bonded pairs. You can imagine that I
looked forward to the season with some keen sense of anticipation.
The pair that seemed most intent on nesting were placed in a
breeding cage about one metre cubed. The other two pairs had the
run of the establishment, indoors and out. One pair escaped with the
roof accident, the male of the caged pair died in the nest during my

absence on a trip. His foot was entangled with some raffia nesting
material and he had been unable to get out. So at the time of writing
I&amp;apos;m down to one pair and an odd female.
There was some serious nesting activity during 1988 (Fig 14.) but
no eggs to my knowledge.
Timor Sparrows have a distinct ritualised greeting between paired
birds. I noticed this many times during the first few months.
I watched one pair. White Right and Yellow Right. After feeding
they would fly up to the same perch and perform an odd display that
appears to be half-way between peering and aggression (attack
threat). The birds bent forward, bills opening and closing and
uttering a quacking (Fig 15). The whole event lasted about 20 seconds
and was completed by mutual preening. Red Left was seen singing
and displaying to Cerise Left, and they too were obviously paired up.
I watched the greeting display several times with them and noticed
there was little bill movement. In all instances I noted the bills were
open with only the slightest mandible movement. Both birds remind
me of immatures food-soliciting.
There were two nest-boxes, each stuffed with coconut fibre, on a
shelf by the window. White Right and Right Yellow were inspecting
one of these. They were seen together on top of the box in the

greeting display, each pointing in the opposite direction to the other.
First one then the other opened its beak and at one point both were
crouched with bills open. The angle of the body is about the same as
that of a female soliciting copulation. In most cases I observed, the
birds were head to tail and if one (the male?) alighted next to the
other on a perch, it would hop about-face before bending in greeting.
Generally, this behaviour was noted on flat surfaces. Often another
Timor, one from another bonded pair and invariably the female,
would join the greeting couple and break up the party with much
quacking and clicking.
On one occasion I saw three Timors sitting on the top edge of a
feeding cage on the feeding bench. They were maybe lOin. apart. The
centre bird was WR. He spotted his mate YR up on the shelf a metre
or so away, and went into the greeting posture directed at her. YR
flew down to alight between him and one of the other two,
whereupon WR and YR interacted. The other two on the outer sides
completely ignored the proceedings.
The undirected song is quite different from that of the Java
Sparrow. I have written it down in various ways. My first impression
was clik clik clik cliklikliklikli . The bird performing advertisement
song, stands clear of the perch moving slightly from side to side but
not pointing at any other bird in the vicinity. On another observation
I wrote, "Pink Left in full song 19 Feb. Stands on top of nest box and
nearby cage and performs full advertisement song chip chip chip
chip chip chip chip (gurgling, gargling chip). The note rises as the chip
becomes more rapid and runs into a "gargling chip". He then flies to
the other end of the bird room, sits silently for a moment, flies back
to the song area and repeats song four or five times. No dance."

On another occasion my notes read "Mating song. Red Red
perched alongside Cerise Orange and sang. Difficult to hear but
seems more munia-like than PL but with jumping clear off the perch
with both head and tail twisted towards the female," (Fig 16).
Upon my return from a month in South America I found Pale
Green-Pale Green singing vociferously and I realised I had never had
more than one bird singing at any one time. It seems as though one
male would be dominant for a while then, once breeding activities
were underway it would quieten down while another male hopped
into the limelight. PGPG was undoubtedly bonding to Dark Green-
Dark Green and I Gatrght them up to see if they'd breed in a flight
cage.
Early on, when I was sorting out the unpaired birds, an odd
unpaired male, Lilac Right-Dark Blue Left, came into breeding
condition with such enthusiasm that, in his frustration at not having
an available unpaired female, courted a male Fischer's Whydah and
attempted to mount it. He tries hard to muscle in on WR and YR.
One entry reads ". . . LR DBL in feeding cage when YR enters to
inspect the nest box hanging in the corner. He immediately assumed
the role of her attentive mate. Meanwhile WR is on top of her cage
furiously hopping about trying to get through, threatening LRDBL
who, with bill open, lunges up at WR. He stops for a second,
remembering where the entrance is, and quickly enters the cage".
There was a noisy altercation between the two males, meanwhile
YR flew off. This left WR and LRDBL looking decidedly sheepish. I
caught up the latter and caged him with a few other solitaries.
One pair, in a breeding cage about a metre cubed, went to nest in
a half-open front box. They built the nest with raffia, coconut fibre,

and white cotton threads. I could hear the whining weeeeee from one
bird inside, and assumed this to be the male coaxing or enticing the
female to enter. This began in March. In May upon my return from a
long trip overseas I found the male dead in the nest, his foot tangled
in the raffia holding him trapped within.
My remaining three Timor Sparrows are a bonded pair and an odd
female. But they behave like normal flock birds. I have not heard a
song for months, and not seen any greeting and assume they will
moult over the winter and come back into breeding condition in the
spring. Meanwhile the L. teerinki and L. spectabilis in the same
enclosure (Remember, its now December 1988) are now actively
nest-building!
THE WHITE-SPOTTED MUNIA Lonchura leucosticta is a very
attractive munia. It has a bright personality and a cheerful Zebra-
finch like call. It has bred well in Germany and undoubtedly has the
potential to become a welcome addition to the list of semi-
domesticated finches in Europe. I acquired a pair which had been
imported from Germany in late 1986. They were the only two birds in
the shipment and I hoped they would be a pair. Unfortunately all the
wishful thinking in the world won't turn two hens into a breeding
pair, although they will eventually go to nest and lay eggs, and may
even sit on them for a while as mine did. I kept this pair in a one
metre cubed breeding cage with a wire mesh front and a reeded
perspex top. The cage contained a Ficus benjamina and a small
privet. An ideal enclosure, but cut off from my spy window into the
birdroom, so I was never able to observe their behaviour. As two
females, I doubt I'd have seen very much anyway.
The White-spotted Munia is about 105mm long. An adult bird is
dark earth brown on the head, wings and tail; the mantle, wing-
coverts and lower back being more like dark chocolate. The breast
and flanks are rich sandy-brown to chestnut, ventral region dark
brown and undertail-coverts black. The lower rump and short
uppertail-coverts are yellowish-straw, but the long uppertail-coverts
are black. The white spots of the common name are profuse on the
face, then run in rows of terminal spots back over the head, neck and
mantle. Each wing covert and tertiary has a sub-terminal white spot.
The spots run down the upper breast and along the flanks. The bill is
pale bluish-grey; legs and feet pale grey.
First year adults are very similar and difficult to sex, but in birds
that have moulted into full adult definitive plumage the male appears
to be more brightly coloured, darker brown above and more chestnut
on the breast and flanks. The female is said to be more spotted but I

was not really aware of this. In a group of five young adults I
examined in Singapore recently the spotting was as varied as the five
birds, and there was no difference in browns. Maybe it is the slightly
less-profusely spotted breast and flanks that enhances the chestnut.
In my experience, the male has black heels, the female dark brown.
Also the female has slight pale edges to the undertail-coverts whereas
those of the male are pure black.
I have seen one juvenile in Singapore. It is unmistakeable and
could never be confused with the young of another Lonchura. It is
earth-brown all over, darker above than below. The undertail-coverts
and long uppertail-coverts are very dark brown (this alone would
indicate either L. leucosticta or L. tristissima). It has whitish spots on
the face which extend as short streaks over the crown, ear-coverts
and throat. There are a few whitish spots on the side of the upper
breast. The only white spots on the back and wings are sub-terminal
on the median and greater wing coverts. Bill, legs and feet are pale
grey.
The call note is a distinctive peep , almost like the toot of the Zebra
Finch. The male and female have a slightly different tone of call note,
so the dividing up and separation of unpaired birds will enable the
selection of pairs with reasonable certainty.
I discovered that Mick Plose had a true pair of White-spotted
Munias and gave him two. We figured he would stand a better chance
with one male and three females in an aviary than just the single pair.
Owing to construction of a range of flights being completed late, they
did not go out until July and did not go down in 1988.
THE STREAK-HEADED MUNIA Lonchura tristissima is fairly
wide-spread over much of New Guinea. It is apparently quite
variable in plumage although the pair that Patrick Tay has in
Singapore are quite predictable. It is the same size as the White-
Spotted, and looks like a darker version of the juvenile of that species
(Fig 17). While I'm reluctant to accept Derek Goodwin's suggestion
that L. stygia and L. nevermanni are conspecific I find the similarity
between L. leucosticta and L. tristissima very interesting. They are
surely sibling species at least, and quite possibly leucosticta is a local
sub-specific variant.
The adult bird is dark earth brown all over, darker above, warmer
below. The lower rump and shorter uppertail-coverts are yellowish-
straw, the long uppertail-coverts and undertail-coverts are black.
There are a few white spots on the face, and superciliary, with whitish
shafts to the head feathers giving a more streaked appearance than

spotted. According to Rand and Goodwin but not Beehller there are
pale, indistinct spots to the wing coverts that may form a faint wing
bar. A beautiful "head and shoulders" portrait in Lindgren suggests a
double sub-terminal spot, one either side of the shaft. The certain
discriminator between this species and the White-Spotted is that
tristissima does not have white spots nor streaks on the chin and
throat.
Patrick's pair seemed to be a true pair, they refused to be vocal in
my presence but I thought I heard a difference between the contact
note. The voice is very similar indeed to that of leucosticta. It would
be invaluable to be able to make comparative observations in song
and breeding behaviour. One of the pair was slightly more richly
coloured.
Munia enthusiasts might recall that in my notes on the Black-
rumped Munia L. leucogastroides I included a comparative sketch

trade. In addition to the Black-rumped I showed a White-rumped L.
striata and a White-bellied Munia L. leucogastra. I am not writing in
any detail about this latter species in these notes, because I've not
been able to obtain any specimens at all so far. However my friend
Patrick Tay managed to select one from a shipment of mixed munias
from Indonesia early in 1988. I was able to examine this bird in the
hand and make some detailed colour sketches and measurements.
The sketch with these notes can be compared with my one of the
nominate race from Malaysia in the aforementioned article, and also
with Goodwin's drawing. You may think they are three different
species, and I mention it here to dramatise that the White-bellied is a
fairly variable species. The sketch here is of the race castanonota (Fig
18).

THE FIVE-COLOURED MUNIA L. quinticolor is regularly
imported these days and has now been bred several times in Britain.
It is a pretty bird, distinguished by the white shaft streaks on the
ear-coverts, noticeable even on the immature (Fig 19). It is usually
imported with Indonesian Java Maja Munias L. ferruginosa (now
usually grandiosely called Lombok Munias in the trade.) The juve-
niles are virtually identical but can be separated by the ear-coverts. In
addition, careful examination of the head feathers will usually show

an odd dark feather - also indicating quintocolor. The reason for
including this munia in my notes on rare munias is that there is a form
with golden rump and uppertail-coverts. In the three shipments I'm
aware of all the birds in the shipment were golden rumped. This
suggests it is a distinct race from the normal reddish-chestnut-rumped
bird. Goodwin describes the bird as . . Rump, uppertail-coverts
and the wide fringes of the pointed central tail feathers, deep reddish
golden to bright, light golden . . This suggests a variability within a
given population, but with all respect to my friend and munia mentor
I have a strong suspicion that the golden-rumped morph is a distinct
race. When in Singapore recently I was able to examine a major
shipment of finches from the island of Timor. There were several
thousand birds of three species - the Timor Sparrow, the Timor
Zebra Finch, and the golden-rumped L. quinticolor. I selected a
handful of typical specimens and made a detailed colour sketch of
one. I was able to compare it to the "normal" chestnut-rumped form.
To my enlightment the differences were multiple, and not merely
a question of rump colour. Here are my comparison notes:

Side by side, the two birds appear to be almost different species,

work needs to be carried out.

seen maybe a dozen shipments of these birds in Jakarta and
Singapore, but to my disappointment every single bird has had a dark
reddish-chestnut rump.
THE GRAND VALLEY MUNIA L. teerinki has been imported
just once to my knowledge. A few dozen came from Indonesia and
were advertised as Black-breasted Munias. I took five of them, two
males and three females. One young female died in the changeable
autumn weather of 1988, leaving me with two pairs. One pair was
very active in nest-building throughout the late summer and autumn
of 1988, the others never came into breeding condition although they
were very fit.
It is a small, rounded or cobby munia, about 100mm long (Fig 20).
The adult has the face, throat and centre of the breast, heels and
undertail-coverts black. The upperparts are brown with the uppertail-
coverts straw-coloured. The lower breast, belly and flanks are white.
There is an irregular line running from the centre breast down the
flanks. It is very distinctive and is a certain diagnostic. This line down
the flanks tends to be continuous in the adult male, and broken in the
female. It is not pure black; there is a touch of cinnamon at the side of

the breast and small patches of this among the black of the flank line.
When a bonded true pair are seen side by side the male can be seen to
be blacker on the face and breast, and the line down the flanks
unbroken. In contrast the female is a little browner on the face and
the line on the flanks is broken. The bill is pale grey and the legs and
feet blackish. Young males in first adult plumage are very difficult to
tell from females. I would hesitate to predict the sex of a single bird.
This delightful and unusual munia is found only in the Grand
Valley area of the Snow Mountains of West Irian Jaya, and is said to
favour man-made grasslands, gardens and weedy growth. There is
one population in the north, L.t. teerinki as described above (this is
the race imported) and several populations of another race L.t. maria
on the southern slopes, reportedly more intense black on the head
and richer deeper brown above.
I have found it an easy species to cater for, they will take all
manner of seeds and enjoy millet on the spray. They show a distinct
preference for vertical and angled perching like every munia I have
had from New Guinea (and many others) and will prefer to work
their way up a vertical perch than fly from one horizontal perch to
another. Similarly they will alight on a suspended branch hanging
downwards rather than a horizontal perch. They chirrup more like
sparrows than my other munias. They are very sociable, roosting

together in warm corners, beneath some overhanging ferns, or high
under the eaves. The pairs roost touching each other, often in a nest
basket. Whilst they have shown a great deal of interest in the
hay-filled tenements and baskets. I've never seen them show the
slightest interest in nest-boxes, not those with holes nor any of the
many half-open front variants I have around the birdroom.
The male has a quiet typical munia song that he utters with little
ceremony, only slightly fluffed and slightly stretched. It is concluded
when the female crouches slightly, twisted a little towards him.
However, I have not seen attempted copulation and suspect this is
not full intensity display. I run a daylight neon tube for 13 hours every
day, year round, which is essential for tropical birds in my opinion.
This means of course that our winter with its long nights does not
have a significant effect on the bio-rhythms of my birds. It is quite
possible that I might see some successful breeding between sending
these notes to our editor, and seeing their publication. If so I will
certainly send some follow up notes.
Well that concludes my current notes on rare munias. I hope it will
inspire those few enthusiasts who have attempted to breed (maybe
successfully?) some of these species to write their own notes and send
them to the editor. I will happily collaborate with any sketches or
comments if required. I'm also perfectly willing to collate short notes
from different aviculturists into one digest.

Breeding of Grey-cheeked Parrots Brotogeris pyrrhopterus
In November 1985 I managed to obtain nine Grey-cheeked
Parrots from Customs and Excise. They were kept together in a large
cage for the rest of the winter and in the spring of 1986 they were put
into a large aviary with six nest-boxes. In November of that year one
young bird was bred and left the nest, but after a few days, due to the
cold winter, it died. They did not go to nest again in 1987 or 1988 but
this year (1989) I was surprised when inspecting the nest-boxes that
three young were in one of them. The first of these left the nest in the
middle of July and a week later the other two also came out. They
were exactly the same as their parents except that they had black
beaks and their colours were duller. Both parents went into the nest
together to feed, and I found that when the young came out of the
nest, they stayed with their parents all the time although they were in
a colony.
While this is not a first breeding, as Mr. W. Lewis bred them first
in 1925, they have as far as I can find out, not bred in this country
since, according to Rosemary Low in her article in the Avicultural
Magazine , Vol. 93, No. 4 (1987), they were bred at Loro Parque, but
have seldom been bred in Europe.
When I had my nine birds sexed in 1987 I found that I had seven
females and two males, and according to other people who have these
birds in their collections, there is a shortage of males. I have found
the birds hardy and have only lost two during the time I have had
them.
According to J.M. Forshaw ( Parrots of the World ) the length of
these birds is 20cm. The birds are distributed in South America, West
of the Andes, from Chone River District, Western Ecuador, South
Piura and extreme North-West Peru.

Winter food of feral Ring-necked Parrakeets
I wondered for a long time what these birds (presumably Psittacu-
la krameri ) fed on during the winter. It is alas only too clear what they
eat during part of the year. They are a destructive pest to anybody
who tries to grown apples. Later they seem to feed in high hawthorn-
hedges.
When my attention was first drawn to them, 15 or more years ago.

they were winter feeding on bird tables in the Weybridge area, but it
was difficult to believe that this was the sole source of food. Apart
from anything else their numbers would seem to have overwhelmed
the hospitality even of the good burghers of Weybridge. It has been
possible to count between 30 and 40 birds in the air at one time.
The observation by members of my family that they were feeding
systematically on horse-chestnut Aesculus hippocastanum buds may
indicate that they will eat a wide variety of plant food.

New Parrot species discovered in Ecuador and Peru
How many bird species unknown and un-named by man have
been lost in the tropics due to deforestation in recent years? The
answer to this question will never be known. Who could have
foreseen that two new Parrot species would be discovered in 1985?
One of these could have been a victim of deforestation.
In the early part of 1986 I received a letter from Robert Ridgely
with the exciting news that he had discovered a new species of
Pyrrhura conure in south-western Ecuador. He wrote: "Its popula-
tion is surely very small and its forest habitat is getting cut from under
it. The new species is part of the P. melanura complex but stands
apart in several important field characters."
In the first issue of Parrotletter, the newsletter and journal of the
ICBP/SSC Parrot Specialist Group, there is a brief report on a small
expedition to Ecuador which took place in August 1987. Its purpose
was to begin the process of conserving the still un-named conure.
On the first day of field work two flocks totalling 18 birds were
observed feeding in scattered fruit trees in a heavily cut-over valley.
This sighting extended the range of this Pyrrhura by 100km north of
the discovery site. It alleviated concern that its population might be
limited solely to the El Oro Province. However, the remaining
habitat appeared to be decreasing quickly near Naranjal with 50 per
cent of the forest having been cleared for cattle.
Five sites were checked along the Andes at the Conure's preferred
elevation; all were devoid of this species or, indeed of any small
Parrots except Celestial Parrotlets Forpus coelestis.
Parrotletter reported: "After three weeks of dodging landslides,
camping at elevations up to 4,000 metres, and descending freshly cut
roads without brakes, the survey team returned to Quito having
confirmed that Ridgely's conure was indeed a unique and isolated

species. It appears to occupy a very narrow elevation band between
600m and 1,200m in the cloud forest." The bird prefers the moist
forested slopes which are enveloped by mist and fog daily.
This species has been formally named the El Oro Parrakeet
Pyrrhura orcesi.
The second new species was discovered in Peru. Dr. Charles
Munn repeatedly observed and photographed a small green Parrotlet
unlike any previously described. There were five individuals. Dr.
Munn was working for Wildlife Conservation International, a divi-
sion of New York Zoological Society. The following year his study
site was 30km further downstream on the Manu and he and his
Peruvian assistants repeatedly observed flocks of a dozen or more of
the same species feeding on the fruits of Coussapoa (fig family).
Having become familiar with their vocalisations. Dr. Munn has
since seen and heard this species in many parts of the Manu River
basin. It appears to be a Nannopsittaca , a genus of which only one
species was previously known, the Tepui Parrotlet N.panychlora.
The latter has yellow around the eye but is otherwise green with a
dusky bill. Length is about 5 l /2\n. (14cm). The new species is bright
green with powder-blue forecrown and flesh coloured bill.
In 1987 it was observed in a previously unexplored region of Peru,
near the Brazilian border, feeding on bamboo seeds.

stellae , which is housed indoors in a flight cage, is routinely fed a
selection of fruit together with the usual nectar mixture. Most
favoured are grapes and apple, with lesser enthusiasm being shown
for tomato, pear and banana. The birds will not touch orange.
Recently, slices of pomegranate were offered for the first time. Both
birds showed immediate interest, more especially in the rind rather
than in the fruity seeds. The birds began to chew into the rind,
presumably extracting a small amount of fluid, and proceeded to
"ant" with the juice, spreading it throughout their plumage with jerky
movements and over their feet. This behaviour continued for as long
as 10 to 15 minutes after the introduction of the fruit, always using the
juice from the rind only. At no time were any of the more extreme
postures associated with anting in other species observed. Between
the application of each mouthful of juice the feathers were shaken

having been eaten by the birds. This behaviour has always been
observed whenever pomegranate is offered.
Subsequent to this observation pomegranate has been offered to
two pairs of Goldie&amp;apos;s Lorikeets Trichoglossus goldiei and to a pair of
Yellow-backed Chattering Lories Lorius garrulus flavopalliatus.
None of these birds have ever shown any unusual interest in the fruit.

A.B. NEWLIFE 75 HATCHER
A moving air hatcher using the
same thermally efficient cabinet
as the Newlife Incubator, which is
easy to use and clean. The dry
bulb temperature is held within
+/- 0-25*C. No more humidity trays
to fill, just fill the container on the
outside to give the required
humidity. Suitable for all species
including birds of prey, parrots,
gamebirds and waterfowl. Its
main advantage is that its
maximum humidity may be
regained within 15 minutes of
closing the lid.
A six compartment hatching tray,
as shown, is available as an
optional extra.
The AB NEWLIFE 75 has a
success record of incubating all
types of avian species including
parrots, birds of prey, gamebirds
and waterfowl.
A moving air incubator with the
proven AB automatic
temperature and humidity control
using the latest solid state
technology, with the temperature
accurate to +/- 0-25*C. Features
include electronic humidity
control, 3 egg trays as standard
with inserts suitable for any size
of egg. The machine has its own
water supply for the humidity and
wet bulb. The cabinets are made
from thermally efficient material
with an attractive durable finish
which is easy to clean and
sterilise.

Brown-hooded Kingfisher H.a. albiventris and the Micronesian
Kingfisher H.c. cinnamomina. Due to the situation on the island of
Guam, information was available for the propagation of the Microne-
sian species but parameters had not been sufficiently produced as to
minimal cage size, proper diet and nest-sites for Halcyons in general.
A variety of food such as live insects, fish and other small vertebrates
provided the kingfisher with the suitable nutritional need for proper
egg production and rearing of young. Cage size and proper nest-sites
also had to be determined. The materials used for the nest-sites had
to be stable enough not to collapse during excavation yet could not be
too hard thus discouraging the nesting pair. Flight space of approx-
imately 11. m 3 , with perching placed 1.5m +/- .5m from the nest/log/
bank proved to be sufficiently large enough to allow flights into the
nest material and excavation of the nest-site.
By using observations from each species, propagation of all three
proved successful. At the time of writing, 12 White-breasted Kingfis-
hers, 3 Brown-hooded Kingfishers and 3 Micronesian Kingfishers
have been produced at our facility.
The genus Halcyon contains a group of inland Kingfishers set
apart by a comparatively broad, stout bill and long legs (Hanzak,
1965). They vary in colour from black to blue or green, and from rust
to black-brown. The beak is black, brown, or red, and sometimes
bicoloured (Grzimek, 1973).

Found throughout Asia minor to southeast Asia the White-
breasted Kingfisher Halcyon s. smyrnensis has striking visual charac-
teristics. The chin, throat and centre of the breast is white, the bib of
the male being 30% larger than the female's. Chocolate brown covers
the head and remaining underparts, accented with turquoise blue
primary-coverts. Less dependent on water than some of its counter-
parts, one can find this bird in deciduous forests some distance from
open water, or on open rice fields. A noisy and conspicuous bird, the
White-breasted Kingfisher is a common sight on telegraph wires or
leafless branches that it uses as a vantage point to hunt large insects,
fish, frogs, reptiles, small mammals and even small birds (Forshaw,
1985a).
These birds lay a clutch of glossy white, rounded eggs in an
excavated burrow. These burrows are usually made along the side
bank of a stream or ditch. The burrows have been found to slope
upward with a 70mm diameter and are from 50cm to a metre in
length. Both parents have been observed sharing incubation and care
of the eggs and chicks (Forshaw, 1985a).
The Frankfurt Zoo bred this species using a clay bank. The
parents shared incubation duties and fed to the young small fish,
cockroaches, maggots, and soft food (Grzimek, 1973).
The Cincinnati Zoo acquired a pair of White-breasted Kingfishers
in January, 1987. Their enclosure consisted of an off-exhibit aviary
2.2m x 2.3m x 3.0m in height. Perches measuring .5cm to 3cm in
diameter were placed in the top corners of the aviary at a distance of
1.5m from the face of the nest-box. The open-faced box was
constructed of plywood measuring 1.3m x .7m x 1.0m high filled
with clay, top soil, sand and sphagnum moss to simulate a mud bank.
The top of the box had a 3.0cm lip to allow water to collect. The top
panel was perforated with 1mm holes to enable the water to seep
down into the box in order to keep the contents moist. This artificial
mud bank was mounted 1.5m above the ground in the rear of the
enclosure. A diet of goldfish, minnows, mice, mealworms, fly larvae,
waxworms and crickets was offered throughout the day. A fifteen-
hour photoperiod for the cage was controlled manually with the use
of a timer.
Seven tunnels were excavated between September and December.
A tunnel 51cm in length was used and an additional two weeks were
spent completing the nest-chamber. The tunnel diverged to the right
at a 20* angle, thus no direct line of sight to the next chamber was

available. Throughout January 1988, the pair took turns in manning
the cavity. On 1st February vocalisations from the cavity indicated at
least one successful hatching. On 6th February, three empty shells
were removed from the chamber by the adults. Twenty-six days after
the vocalisations were heard, the first juvenile emerged from the
nest. Within the next three days the remaining two chicks also
fledged. In March several eggs were found broken inside the display
and periodical nesting attempts continued for three weeks. On 27th
May the mud bank was reconstructed and excavation of a tunnel
began within 10 days. While this tunnel was also diverged to the side,
we were able to see inside clearly enough to detect five eggs on 24th
June. The first two hatchings were observed on 11th July, plus an
additional two by 13th July. Further excavations of the nest chamber
continued until the chicks were moved out of the line of sight from
the entrance of the tunnel, making further observations impossible.
Five chicks hatched and were fledged by 2nd August, 1988. To date, a
total of 12 offspring have been produced.

BROWN-HOODED KINGFISHER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997857675" page_id="58075148"  page_num="5" year="" vol="">
The Brown-hooded Kingfisher Halcyon a. albiventris inhabits
wooded and savannah country near rivers throughout Kenya and
Tanzania to Central Africa (Williams, 1985).
The Brown-hooded Kingfisher is aptly named due to a greyish-
brown nape and forehead, shaft streaked with a brownish black. This
bird spends much of its time on fenceposts, protruding branches and
telegraph wires waiting for prey to appear on the ground below. This
prey consists mainly of large insects along with frogs, small reptiles
and, occasionally, fish. Nesting occurs in burrows excavated by the
birds in an earth bank. These burrows have been noted to slope
upwards for approximately 45cm and then turn to one side (Forshaw,
1985b). A clutch of eggs, averaging four in number, is deposited in
the nest chamber (Mackworth-Praed, 1957).
A pair of wild-caught Brown-hooded Kingfishers was acquired by
the Cincinnati Zoo in January 1987. These two birds were placed in a
public display measuring 2.7m x 1.5m x 2.7m in height. Perching in
the form of three mulberry trees 0.5-2m from the nest cavity was
provided. The pair was placed on a diet consisting mainly of crickets,
mealworms and waxworms with supplemental feedings of small
vertebrates. A nest-box was mounted outside the display measuring
0.2m x 0.4m x 0.5m high. The chamber was filled with a moist
mixture of top soil, sand and sphagnum moss. The box was connected
to the display with a tube 4cm long with a diameter of 7cm, on 6th
May, 1988.
Excavation of the nest-site began two days after the nest-box was
provided for the pair. By the end of May, activity going in and out of
the nest site had discontinued. On opening the nest-chamber we
found three eggs, apparently abandoned by the female. The eggs
were taken for artificial incubation.
The three eggs were incubated at 99.5*F dry bulb and 86*F wet
bulb. Two of the eggs were fertile and hatched on 18th &amp; 19th June,
1988. These eggs were noted to have shells thinner than those found
in our other kingfishers. The chicks weighed 7.0gr and 6.7gr respec-
tively. The chicks were fed diced, newborn mice warmed in Pedialyte
and given vitamin supplements in the form of Necton-S. The
temperature was kept at 99.5*F for 24 hours, then lowered first to
97.5* for the next seven days, then continuing to decrease as the birds
matured. Both chicks began to form pellets at four days old and
fledged at 25 days old. At the time of fledging both birds were feeding
on mealworms, crickets, anoles and fish.

Modifications were made on the nest-box making it deeper by
adding a 0.2m x 0.3m x 0.3m high extension on the top posterior
portion of the box. This made the total length 0.7m in which the pair
could tunnel.
While the hand-rearing of the two Brown-hooded chicks con-
tinued, the adult pair began to excavate a new tunnel on 7th June,
1988. Adjustments in the diet of increased amounts of minnows,
goldfish and anoles were made. On 22nd June nesting began with the
female producing three eggs. These eggs had denser shells than the
eggs produced previously. The first evidence of a successful hatch
appeared on 16th July when vocalisations could be heard from the
nest-chamber. One chick that had died was thrown out of the nest,
and later we learned another of the remaining two had also died. The
third chick appeared outside the nest on 11th August and was soon
feeding on its own.

MICRONESIAN KINGFISHER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987399391304348" page_id="58075149"  page_num="6" year="" vol="">
The male Micronesian Kingfisher Halcyon c. cinnamomina, with
its greenish-blue black and cinnamon head and breast and black
banding from the lores to ear-covert differs from the female which
has a buff white upper breast and throat (Forshaw, 1985c). This
kingfisher was endemic to the island of Guam before its extermina-
tion due to the introduction of the Brown Tree Snake, Boiga
irregularis. This secretive species feeds mainly on large insects and
was found nesting in holes of trees excavated by the pairs. Additional
nest-sites have been found in decaying standing wood, arboreal
termitaria or tree fern roots. (Marshall, 1989). U.S. zoos have bred
the Micronesian Kingfisher using deciduous logs far enough into
decay that the log itself was crumbling (Shelton, 1986). The density of
wild nests were evaluated by taking the mean of 10 penetrations by a
12.5cm long ice pick into the nest tree in the vicinity of the excavation
with a single pushing motion. The penetrability of nest trees was
7.4cm +/- 1.8cm, this was greater than that of live trees which was
1.0cm +/- .4cm (Marshall, 1989).
The pair of Micronesian Kingfishers that the Cincinnati Zoo
received in 1986 was a pair of birds which had each been captured in
the same area, leading us to believe that the birds could have been
previously pair-bonded. The birds were placed in an off-exhibit
aviary measuring 2.2m x 4.6m x 3.0m in height, of which this pair
used only 2.2m x 2.3m area for the majority of time. A palm log

measuring lm long and 0.8m in diameter was placed in the upper
corner of the cage. The epidermal covering was removed from the
face of the log. Perching was placed throughout the cage starting at
approximately 2m away from the log. Later the perch 2m from the
log would be used as the point from which to dive into the log for
excavation. By using the method described by Marshall, measure-
ments of penetration were taken on the palm logs used. While the
vascular cylinder was softer (measurements of 8cm +/- 1.0cm were
taken), the outer surface of the logs was vastly harder.
Measurements of 2.5 +/- 1.0cm were taken in the cortex that these
birds were found to excavate. While this method was not absolute,
relative density had been concluded to be greater than the nest-sites
measured on Guam.
After four tunnels were excavated, the pair began to incubate two
eggs in April, 1987. The one chick that hatched died on 13th May,
1987. A second clutch of eggs proved unsuccessful with the pair
having their eggs roll out of the nest through a connecting tunnel. A
third clutch of two eggs was observed in the nest chamber on 24th
June, 1987. Two chicks had hatched; one on 17th July, the other on
19th July. While no observations of the chicks were made at that
time, evidence in the form of two perfectly pipped egg shells
discarded on the aviary floor told of their presence. Both parents
shared in the care of the young. Using the perch 2m away from the
log once used to excavate the nest-site, one bird would call announc-
ing its presence. As one bird flew to the nest with food, the other
would depart. Only one bird did survive to fledging; the other carcass
remained in the nest cavity.

All three species exhibited similar behaviour in courtship, nesting
and rearing of young. A basic formula could then be developed and
applied to other pairs of Halcyons. Minimal cage size of 11m 3 needs
to be provided. Perching lm to 2m from nest site should be offered
for excavation of the nest-cavity and for food transference.
Whether the particular species uses trees or mud banks for nesting
should be researched and the appropriate nest-site provided. The
depth of the bank or log needs to be approximately 0.75m in depth to
provide the adequate length of tunnels for security. The theory that a
low density material was necessary in which tunnel excavation could
take place proved untrue. These animals can enter materials relative-
ly harder than once believed. Nest-sites should be replaced each
season to stimulate courtship and breeding. Offering a variety of live

foods for the rearing of young will help ensure success. By working
with several species representing one genus, patterns can be de-
veloped to further reproductive success. When time and the numbers
of birds are limited, this method not only seems practical but
imperative. The use of two common species; the White-breasted
Kingfisher and the Brown-hooded Kingfisher led to a further prop-
agation of the highly endangered Micronesian Kingfisher at our
institution.

I would like to acknowledge the keepers of the Bird House at the
Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Gardens for their care of the Halcyon
collection and their offspring. The breeding of the White-breasted
Kingfishers was the first in the U.S.A. and the breeding of the
Brown-hooded Kingfishers was the first in captivity. Couple this with
the successful propagation of the Micronesian Kingfisher and they
should indeed be proud of their efforts.

family Daceloninae as opposed to the fishing kingfishers, sub family
Alcedininae. Its range extends from Australia through Norfolk and
Lord Howe Islands to New Zealand and as far as New Caledonia and
the Loyalty Islands. The New Zealand subspecies H.s.vagans is
found throughout New Zealand and on most outlying islands.
It is one of the more colourful New Zealand birds. The upper
parts are predominantly a mixture of reflective blue and green, the
colour appearing to change with the light, and the underparts vary
from reddish buff to white. Males tend to have more buff on the
underparts. There is a black band below the eyes, encircling the neck
with an irregular white band below it. A fine white eyebrow adds
character to the face and the upturned corners of the kookaburra-
type beak add charm to what is already a delightful little bird.
Unfortunately, it is not really suited to aviary living. Even the
Zoo-bred young are perpetually "flighty". At the slightest sign of an
intrusion into the aviary they try to escape by flying into or on to the
netting walls. Even more unfortunate for wild kingfishers, they seem
to be naturally predisposed to flying into things, especially windows.
Most years we have concussed or injured kingfishers brought into the
Zoo for nursing. We seem to receive more injured kingfishers per
head of wild population than any other species of birds. For example,
in the last five years we have received twenty weak or injured
kingfishers. I am sure we are not alone in this respect. Many appear
to be young birds and, as expected, most are brought in during the
winter, when the kingfishers have migrated out of the forest and into
the suburban gardens. In my search through the records for the past
ten years, I could not find a single record of a kingfisher that had been
handed in to the Zoo in spring.
Tragically, at least 50% never recover enough to feed. Most of
those that do recover are released but it does mean that there is
always a regular supply of kingfishers available to put on display.
Surprisingly, in contrast with the above, kingfishers survive quite well
in aviaries, even in quite small aviaries, except that they do not breed

readily. Of all the dozens of institutions in Australasia that must hold
healthy kingfishers from time to time, only two have reported
successful breedings in the International Zoo Year Books. Both these
reports seemed largely to involve individual pairs that were successful
for only a limited number of seasons. One institution was the
Taronga Park Zoo in Sydney which reared four kingfishers from 1982
to 1983, the one in 1983 being a second generation hatching. The
other was the Otorohanga Kiwi Centre, where eight were raised
between 1980 and 1982. My enquiries also revealed that Auckland
Zoo had a pair of kingfishers in a mixed native bird aviary that
attempted breeding several years ago but the three chicks died prior
to fledging. The Head Keeper, Mick Sibley, thought the failure could
be due to keeper interference although our own experience tends to
point towards inadequate feeding. When our pair had three half-
grown chicks the daily food intake was phenomenal. The food
provided, as recorded in the Bird Run diary for the 17th November
1987, is as follows -

Previous earthworms still there and 20 pieces of ox-
heart from midday feed removed, i.e. can give larger
mice, earthworms not so popular.
Less than a week later they were consuming 40 young mice per
day!
These three kingfisher chicks did fledge. In subsequent clutches,
when we were less lavish with the food, one or more chicks died,
usually when they were half to three-quarters grown, which corres-
ponds with the time of their maximum food requirements.
A study of wild kingfishers made in the Orongorongo River
Valley, near Wellington, between 1972 and 1982 showed a direct
correlation between nesting and the emergence of the Chorus Cicada
Amphipsalta zelandica. The Chorus Cicada is a large insect 27mm
long which emerges from the ground into its adult form in summer
and is relished by many insect-eating birds. It survives by weight of
numbers. It is my own pet theory that the only reason why the
Long-tailed Cuckoo migrates all the way from the tropics to New
Zealand to breed is to cash in on the cicada boom each summer.
These cicadas are big, juicy, easy to catch, and are in their highest
numbers in the tall timber forests that the Long-tailed Cuckoos most
like to frequent.
The outcome of this is that the kingfishers in the Orongorongos
were quite late nesting. When they did attempt to breed earlier the
nest failed, and if they did nest at the correct time there was seldom
time to rear a second clutch. In the Zoo our pair nested twice both
seasons, presumably because ample food was provided early in the
season.
Another hindrance to captive breeding seems to be the birds'
"flightiness" which has already been touched on. One of our parent
birds was one of the chicks bred at Otorohanga and the other was
hand-reared as a chick by a woman in Christchurch. Both of these

came to us from Orana Park in Christchurch. I then learned that the
breeding pair of kingfishers at Otorohanga had also been handreared
orphans! Mick Sibley, however, reports the Auckland Zoo birds were
wild-caught.
A suitable nest site may also be a factor. In the wild the kingfishers
will tunnel into clay banks or trees. At Orana Park no nest-box was
provided and although eggs were laid there was no attempt to nest.
At Auckland Zoo the kingfishers burrowed into the ground. At
Otorohanga the kingfishers were provided with a tall nest-box, filled
with rotten wood and fixed horizontally on the aviary framework, the
birds tunnelling into the rotten wood. In later years, they tunnelled
into rotten logs. At Wellington Zoo I built a nest-box specially for
them. The only wild nest I had seen close up had been in a big old
Kingfisher nest-box used at Wellington Zoo (measurements in mm).

tree stump. The nest was less than 2m off the ground and readily
accessible in that the stump stood exposed in a paddock. I remem-
bered, though, that the entry tunnel was quite long and narrow, too
small for my young hand at the time. From that I deduced the birds
would not mind if the nest looked conspicuous, provided it had a
secure entry tunnel. The next problem was that I could not put a long
tunnel on to a small box without it becoming front heavy. I resolved
to keep the tunnel less than half a metre long and instead began to
worry if the kingfishers would dive into the tunnel at speed and hit the
back wall of the box with a crunch. I tried to solve the problem by
putting a slight kink into the tunnel against which the birds would
slide and hopefully slow down before hitting the back wall.
The kingfishers were received from Orana Park on 5th February
1987. The nest-box was given to them in early spring, on 25th August,
and the following day the kingfishers spent all day sitting on the box,
or around it. Eighteen days later, on 13th September, the female was
reported as being out of sight and exactly one month after that she
was deemed to be sitting in earnest, i.e. she was out of sight all day.
The aviary is what we call our "Stilt Aviary". It measures 9.7m x
4.9m wide and 2.4m high. The front half of the aviary is dominated by
a wide, shallow pool 4.5m in diameter. Behind the pool is an oak
tree. The nest-box was hung on the netting wall above the oak tree so
that as the oak came into leaf the box would be hidden from view.
The box was also placed here because it was the point farthest away
from the service paths used by the keeper. In fact it is the only part of
the aviary that a keeper does not pass through during the daily
servicing. Perching was provided over the pond and under a small
shelter roof at the back of the aviary. The food dishes were placed
within reach of the perch at the back. The aviary was landscaped with
mounds of fine sand and scattered carex grass to simulate a beach
scene. Normal residents of the aviary were four Pied Stilts, a Greater
Knot and a young Spur-winged Plover.
The aviary at Auckland Zoo, although taller, occupied a similar
volume and that at Otorohanga was positively huge, the largest
walk-through aviary in New Zealand, some 49m high. The aviary at
Orana Park was approximately 6m x 6m x 2.5m high.
The birds were fed a basic diet of coarsely minced oxheart and
premix. The oxheart is the basic diet for kiwis in captivity and the
premix is a vitamin and mineral supplement, specially formulated to
make the oxheart a complete diet. This was the same as a diet
provided for the kingfishers at Otorohanga. Because of the size of the
aviary at Otorohanga the kingfishers were able to forage for addition-

al live food. For example in 1984 the Tuis Prosthemadera
novaeseelandiae bred in the large aviary and appeared to raise their
chicks almost entirely on passion vine hoppers which were abundant
at the time. At Wellington, the kingfishers were given live food once
or twice a week to bring them into breeding condition. Geoff Moon
in his book "Refocus on New Zealand Birds", reported trying to
hand-rear young kingfishers on shredded beef, only to have the
chicks weaken until he added small crabs to the diet.
Incubation is given by Geoff Moon as only 18 days although chicks
were not heard until 15th November. The volume of live food being
supplied was increased at the end of the month and on 4th November
the male was seen carrying food into the box even though the female
was off the nest feeding. From 13th November it became very hard to
keep up with the demand for live food. Normally the adults are given
a small dish of meat once a day. Now the dish seemed to empty
between feeds, even when we were feeding five times a day. The
volume at each feed was increased as per the records quoted at the
beginning of the article.
On the 19th the male was seen to catch a small mouse which he
bashed repeatedly before taking it into the nest-box. When he came
out again he was carrying faecal sacs in his beak.
There is a danger when feeding young mice in bulk that the chicks
may not be receiving enough calcium because of poor ossification in
the young mice and we endeavoured to provide adult skinks. Even
though these were the Common Skinks Leiolopisma nigriplantare, it
always seemed a crime to feed skinks as food and they were always
given sparingly, and only in the last two weeks prior to fledging. The
skinks were caught by laying milk bottles or tins, baited with a little
honey water at the bottom, on sloping ground, under cover, in areas
that skinks were known to frequent. Sometimes there would be three
or four skinks caught in one bottle in one day, although quite often
none would be caught. Gravid females were always released again.
The youngsters were due to fledge on the 26th, assuming the first
had hatched on 1st November, but it was not until 4 p.m. on 2nd
December 1987 that the first was found out of the nest. It could fly
well but its feet were caked with white faecal(?) matter. The second
fledged half an hour later, also with caked feet and the decision was
made to remove all three for cleaning. The nest-box had been lined
with clay to represent a natural clay tunnel and this had obviously
been a mistake. At this stage the chicks could be aged by the amount
of pin feathers still remaining on the forehead. After the chicks had
been cleaned they had to be kept in the brooder room overnight to

dry out.
The chicks proved too nervous to hand-feed and the next morning
they were returned to the parents' aviary. The male was obviously
very pleased to see them and promptly started feeding them with
baby mice. The youngest seemed unable to reach the high perch at
the back and the male went down to the ground to feed it. At one
stage the Plover approached the chick and made a jab at it. The chick
responded by opening its beak and wings in a defensive-threat display
and the Plover moved off. The chick was then lifted on to the perch at
the back, next to its brothers and out of harm&amp;apos;s way. The chicks were
brought inside for the next two nights because of inclement weather
and had their first night outside on 5th December.
Within two weeks the female was nesting again. Everything
proceeded smoothly until 4th January 1988 when it was noticed that
the male was driving the young birds off all his favourite perches. The
following day the male was even harder on them and the young birds
had to be removed from the aviary. One was already thin and weak,
requiring hospitalisation, and one had disappeared without a trace.
To this day we don't know whether it died or escaped. They are such
swift fliers that on several occasions one or the other of the adults has
darted through the open door as the keeper has entered the adjoining
aviary, often without the keeper being aware of it. For this reason,
keepers are taught to be particularly careful with the outside door to
the aviary. Fortunately the adults know where the adjoining door is
and are easily herded back.
The weaker chick died two days later and the Veterinarian
diagnosed thrush as a result of stress. The stronger chick was started
on a course of Mycostatin but it too died on 11th January.
Meanwhile the next clutch was due to hatch on 8th January and on
the 22nd the box was checked to reveal one chick approximately 7cm
high. The chick's pin feathers were forming and the eyes were just
opening. The live food supply was maintained but on 31st January the
chick was no longer heard vocalising although the parents still
seemed to be in attendance.. On 2nd February, when there was still
no sound from the nest, the box was checked to reveal that the chick
had died, probably a couple of days earlier. The chick had not been
given any skinks or furred young mice, even though it was at the
feather-growing stage and cause of death may have been a deficiency
in calcium or silica for feather growth. The box was then removed for
the winter.
On 7th September 1988 the box was returned to the same place
and the parents were obviously excited to have it back. They became

very vocal. The normal territory call is a loud kek kek kek but during
breeding they seem to communicate to each other with a quieter kree
kree kree and later with a crooning noise which seems to arouse the
chicks to beg. The chicks' begging call is quite a harsh sound,
distinctive but hard to describe.
By 13th September the parents were seen going in and out of the
box regularly and from 26th September the female was out of sight
for most of the day. The chicks were due to hatch on 22nd October
but even on the 27th there was no apparent movement of food to the
box. On 2nd November chicks could be heard in the box and as soon
as both parents came off the nest the box was inspected to reveal
three chicks. Two chicks were about 65mm high, turning blue from
the pin feathers under the skin. The third was smaller and still pink.
The supply of live food was kept up but with more emphasis placed
on the oxheart in case part of the previous problem was with the
fledged youngsters not taking the artificial diet. When the nest was
checked on 19th November one chick was dead, the youngest was
missing and the third was starting to get rather dirty. The third was
removed for cleaning and when he proved to hand-feed quite readily
he was subsequently hand-reared. The nest-box was cleaned, relined
with bark chips and sawdust and returned to the aviary.
The female was next reported sitting on 10th December and chicks
were heard on 5th January 1989. A quick check revealed three
chicks, three-quarters grown. The first fledged 18th January followed
by the other two on the 21st. Unfortunately one was found the next
day with a broken wing which our Veterinarian was forced to
amputate; however, this bird died while still under hospital care. The
remaining two were transferred to a small aviary next to the first
young bird where a close eye could be kept on both of them.
All three are now together, fully accustomed to the oxheart/
premix diet and doing well. They have coloured up and one of the
second pair is quite different from the other two. The centre of her
back is a dull olive brown, her shoulders are a duller blue than those
of her mates and she has distinctive dark brown tips to her chest
feathers. Her chest is also noticeably whiter than those of the males.
Newly-fledged kingfishers have distinctive light barring on the chest.
The New Zealand race is supposed to be bigger than the Austra-
lian race and most books give a length of 240-250mm. This seems
incredibly long when looking at a kingfisher in the field. Kingfishers
are usually seen, particularly in winter, sitting hunched on a post or a
telegraph wire waiting for something to move that they can pounce
on. At these times they look only 120- 130mm long. To check the

length the young female was caught up on 30th May; she measured
220mm stretched full length from bill tip to tail tip.
All the kingfishers had been weighed at various times for oral
worming with Synanthic as part of a routine programme. On 15th
February 1989 the young female weighed 65g and the two young
males with her were both 70g. The parents were weighed on 21st
February, the female being 70g and the male 64g. The three young
fledged in 1987 weighed 62, 65 and 67g on 4th December 1987, and
two males that were rehabilitated weighed 67 and 68g on 18th
September 1987 just prior to release.
In conclusion, it would appear that in order to breed the Sacred
Kingfisher the chances of success are increased with the use of captive
or hand-reared birds and the provision of a tunnel box or rotten logs
into which the birds can burrow. The birds must have access to
natural food. Invertebrates are required for the first two weeks post
hatching. Kingfishers appear to accept a wide variety of inverte-
brates. After two weeks the adults start rejecting invertebrates in
favour of small vertebrates. In the wild kingfishers are known to take
small birds. Our success with the last clutch would indicate that small
furred mice are adequate, although skinks appear to be just as
popular.
Post fledging it is probably advantageous to remove the young to a
small aviary on their own where their food consumption, and in
particular their acceptance of the artificial diet, can be monitored.
The young birds have to be removed from the aviary as soon as the
parents start breeding again anyway.
Unfortunately the rewards are small. The birds, parents and
young alike, remain shy and flighty, spending much of their time
towards the back of the aviary. When rearing young the food
consumption is prodigious. At 40 mice a day it did not take long to
deplete our own resources. I do not know why the Taronga Park
birds stopped breeding but I did learn from Eric Fox, the Curator
presently at Otorohanga, that the kingfishers were removed from the
big aviary when they started attacking other nestlings. The kingfis-
hers failed to nest in the smaller aviary into which they were moved,
and because of the shyness they are no longer displayed at all.
For all that I still have a soft spot for them. They are beautiful to
look at and I just love hearing their vocalisations.

This bunting is widely distributed throughout much of Africa. It is
not brightly coloured, but quietly attractive nonetheless. The head of
the cock is black, with a white stripe above the eye and two white
stripes below the eye. The chin is blackish. The back is dark brown,
while the breast is cinnamon, as the name suggests. The hen
resembles the cock, but is generally duller.
A pair of these buntings was obtained during May 1986. They
were in rather poor plumage, which much improved after the birds
were placed outside in a 25ft (7.62m) flight, containing a mixed
collection of seed-eating birds. Not surprisingly, the birds made no
attempt to breed, being very quiet and inoffensive and keeping to
themselves. The two birds tended to remain together. The cock was
first heard to sing in September, the song being a fairly typical
bunting type of song, characterised fairly accurately in Roberts 'Birds
of Southern Africa as " per-pe , pee-e-eter-cher\ The birds were taken
indoors at the end of October and housed in a large flight cage of 12&amp;apos;
x 18&amp;quot; x 18&amp;quot; (3.66 x 0.46 x 0.46m), together with ten other small
seedeaters. During the winter the hen laid an occasional egg on the
floor of the cage. The eggs are dull white, heavily covered with
reddish brown spots.
The buntings were released outside on the 5th April 1987, being
placed in an aviary 10&amp;apos; x 6&amp;apos; x 6&amp;apos; (3.05 x 1.83 x 1.83m), together
with five other pairs of seedeaters. On 20th April a small cup nest,
built entirely of coconut fibre, was discovered on the edge of a clump
of heather, about 3&amp;apos; (0.91m) from the ground. The following day the
hen bunting was sitting on the nest. By now the cock was singing
strongly, especially in the evenings. At no time was there any sign of
aggression towards the other birds in the aviary, nor was there any of
the vigorous sexual chasing seen in most bunting species. The hen sat
on the nest for a period of about three weeks, but no eggs were laid.
Following a short break, the nest was tidied up with fresh fibre.
The first egg was laid on the 13th May, followed by two more at daily
intervals. Incubation began with the second egg. Contrary to Roberts ,
where it is stated that both sexes incubate, only the hen was ever seen
on the nest. On two occasions during the incubation period the cock

was surprised apparently feeding the hen on the nest, although, as he
was very shy and left the nest when approached, this could not be
confirmed. Two young were present in the nest on the evening of the
26th May, the third egg hatching the following morning. This chick
failed to compete with the older young and had disappeared the same
evening. The newly-hatched young were flesh coloured with greyish
down; the gape was red. A mixture of soaked canary and millet
seeds, mixed with canary-rearing food was provided daily throughout
the rearing period, in addition to the usual dry seed mixture. In
addition approximately a dozen mealworms were provided daily,
these proving popular with the Diamond Sparrows and Green
Singing Finches which shared the aviary and not very many were
available to the Buntings. From the beginning there was a clear
difference in feeding habits between the sexes. The cock bunting was
extremely interested in the mealworms and was always first to obtain
some, whereas the hen seemed to have little or no interest in
livefood, choosing preferentially to take the soaked seed/eggfood
mixture. Neither showed any interest in greenfood.
At all stages of the breeding cycle the hen Bunting was tamer than
the cock, always being willing to feed the nestlings while being
observed from outside the aviary, a distance of just over 6 feet (2m).
The cock, on the other hand, would initially 'freeze' upon being
observed and then quickly slip away from the nest, even when, in the
later stages, the hen would continue to feed the young while standing
at his side. Unlike European buntings at no stage was food carried to
the young in the bill, the nestlings, and later on the fledglings, always
being fed from the crop, whether with seed or with livefood.
The hen had almost ceased to brood the young during the day by
3rd June and the two young left the nest on 10th June, at 15 days.
Most of the postfledging care was carried out by the cock, with the
young gradually achieving independence about two weeks later. The
young generally resembled the hen on fledging, but the distinctive
striping on the head was buffish rather than white.
The hen began to rebuild the nest on 14th June and the first egg of
the second clutch was laid on 20th June, this clutch also consisting of
three eggs. During the incubation of this clutch the two young
developed the habit of sitting on the nest alongside the female. This
habit did not produce any aggression from the adults. Possibly as a
result of this habit only one of the three eggs hatched, the other two
being addled. The young were removed from the aviary on the 27th
June, six days before the chick hatched. The single chick only lived
for three days. No further nesting attempt was made although the

cock continued to sing for some time.
All four Buntings were brought inside for the winter at the end of
October and placed in the same flight cage as before, together with a
number of other birds. Both young had fully moulted by this time,
both proving to be hens. Within a few days of being caged the cock
recommenced singing, presumably stimulated by the extended light
period, the lights being on for a total of 13V2 hours a day. Soon
afterwards one of the young hens started to tear strips of newspaper
from the floor of the cage. Eventually on 4th December, a nest was
built in a rear corner of the cage, on the floor, using pieces of
newspaper and some coconut fibre that was provided, a short length
of dry heather having been pinned diagonally across the corner to
form a foundation for the nest. One young hen appeared to be
dominant over both the other hen and her mother, and carried out
most of the nest-building, although all three hens were seen to carry
nesting material. The birds were not at all shy, quite willing to build,
even when observed from just outside the cage. At no stage was there
any real aggression among the hens. On the 7th December there were
three eggs in the nest. It soon became clear that more than one hen
was laying, for two days later there were six eggs in the nest, with a
seventh on the cage floor. The three new eggs in the nest were larger
and lighter in colour than the first three. Three eggs were removed
from the nest and a slide was introduced, shutting the dominant
young hen in with the nest, whereupon she settled to incubate,
showing no signs of distress at being separated from the others. All
the eggs proved to be infertile. The sexes were then separated for the
rest of the winter, to avoid further nesting attempts.

THE BREEDING AND PARENT-REARING OF EOS
SQUAMATA OBIENSIS , POPULARLY KNOWN AS
WALLACE'S LORY

(Epsom, Surrey)
That enchanting little bird known generally as Wallace&amp;apos;s Lory has
appeared at intervals in this country over many years; only to
seemingly disappear and then emerge again, to be classified as "rare"
by the importers. After much searching I have found no records of
breeding during this time.
The year 1987-88 saw a considerable importation of these birds
and I was fortunate in being able to see some dozens of them, both at
the Importer's premises after quarantine and later at several commer-
cial bird establishments. They were in such good condition that there
was little or no soiling of their plumage and it was easy to see that
there was some variation in their neck markings. In some birds these
were entirely absent, in others quite pronounced.
The birds I have seen are as described by Rosemary Low in the
Avicultural Society's Magazine (Vol. 95 No 1, 1989, page 45); where
she refers to Eos squamata obiensis; (from the Island of Obi in the
Isles of Maluku, Indonesia).
I would suggest that there are three features which help to identify
these birds. As stated by Rosemary Low, the black scapular feathers,
and also the very clearly defined areas of crimson and purple on the
front of the bird, with no "smudging" of the area between the two
colours, and the serrated scarlet line running across the black wing
feathers.
My husband's and my two pairs of adult, surgically-sexed birds all
weigh approximately 3&amp;apos;/20z (lOOg) each, and their total length is
approximately 9&amp;quot; (25cm). The whole of the head, neck, breast, back
and rump, is bright crimson scarlet. The lower part of the breast and
the abdomen right through to the vent is deep purple, in some birds
so deep as to appear almost black. The flanks and upper parts of the
legs are scarlet. The upper tail feathers are brownish red, sometimes
with almost black edging to the end of the feathers; and the under tail
feathers are brown.
The shoulders can have a brown appearance at times in the
females I have seen, and in some of the younger males. This is absent
in older males. I do not for one moment suggest that these birds are

dimorphic, but our two females, and others I have seen, have all had
slightly orange coloured feathers at the base of the upper part of the
leg (near the tarsus); in older males these are scarlet. The younger
males can have a mixture of both colours.
The wing markings of these birds are particularly attractive, being
clearly defined areas of red on the shoulder, set off by the black
scapulars. The primaries are black, and these admirably display the
pretty serrated scarlet line across the black secondary wing feathers.
The underside of the wings are a bright red, giving the birds a most
attractive appearance when they display. On one of our adult males
there is a small but distinct patch or quarter "collar&amp;quot; of dark purple at
the back of the neck. This is absent in the other adult male. The eyes,
which are not large are beautiful because of their dark brown colour
and expressive appearance, portraying their very considerable intelli-
gence. The beak is orange and the legs are grey. For ease of
identification of the colouring, the accompanying sketch will perhaps
be of assistance.
During the summer of 1988 my husband Freddie and I purchased
our first surgically sexed pair. They had just been released from
quarantine and were both in superb condition, their plumage un-
stained by the very liquid diet on which they had been kept. I have

noticed that whereas many species of lories coming out of quarantine,
although perfectly healthy, seem to have got themselves into a very
messy state, these very tidy little birds are in excellent feather.
Our birds quickly acclimatised in the small, sheltered aviary we
gave them and appeared right from the start to be happy and content,
although understandably rather wild at first. This wildness lasted for
several months; now they are some of the tamest and most trusting of
our birds. Another surgically sexed pair bought later is behaving in
exactly similar fashion to the first pair.
The aviary of the first pair consists of a "half-house" approximate-
ly T 6 &amp;quot; (61cm) wide by 4&amp;apos; (122cm) long by 3&amp;apos; (lm) high with a flight 4&amp;apos;
(122cm) wide by 6 &amp;apos; (2m) long by 6 &amp;apos; (2m) high. The floor and walls of
the house are lined with Formica to make cleaning easier, and layers
of newspaper, frequently renewed, with some wood shavings for
extra warmth in winter make a good floor base. The house roof is
interlined with insulating material 4&amp;quot; (10cm) thick. A low wattage
electric light comes on at dusk and remains on all night, going off at
daylight.
The floor of the flight is of ornamental stones laid l A&amp;quot; (.63cm)
apart for ease of cleaning. The flight roof is covered with corrugated
glass fibre transparent roofing material. During the coldest months of
the year the whole of the front of the aviary flight is covered with
thick P.V.G. sheeting so that it is completely protected from wind
and rain, also, of course, snow. The whole of the floor during the
winter of 1988-89 had about 2&amp;quot; (5cm) of wood shavings to protect the
birds as much as possible from cold and damp coming from the stone
floor.
The nest-box we provided is located in the flight. It is 8 V 2 &amp;quot; x 8 V 2 &amp;quot;
x 17&amp;quot; deep. (21.5 x 21.5 x 43cm) with a 3&amp;quot; (7.5cm) diameter
entrance hole, a doweling perch 3 A&amp;quot; (2cm) thick running through
from outside tolnside, a ladder, and an inspection door. A mixture of
brown peat and wood shavings to a depth of 3&amp;quot; (7.5cm) provides the
nesting material and for added warmth during the coldest months we
added a 1&amp;quot; (2.54cm) layer of wood shavings on top of the peat
mixture.
During their first week here these birds had taken, with obvious
pleasure, to our dry food mix which is always accompanied by a cup
of water very close at hand. When feeding lories and lorrikeets a dry
food mix, (even if, as in our case some nectar is also available) it is
absolutely essential to ensure that the birds have water close by the
dry food, so that they are encouraged to drink. This they do with
great pleasure.

Our lories and lorrikeets all have varying quantities of nectar,
made from the same materials as the dry food, fresh twice per day.
Some of them like quite a lot, others only want a very small quantity.
The birds about which I am writing, popularly known as Wallace's,
are amongst those that only want about two tablespoonsful of nectar
twice per day between the two of them, and even that small amount is
not always consumed.
The dry food mix we give our birds varies from day to day, to give
them as much variety as possible. It is always mixed up fresh each
morning for the two feeds per day and consists of various Milupa
baby foods such as the following: Milupa Autumn Fruit Harvest, Oat
Breakfast with apple, 7 Cereal Breakfast, Mixed Fruit variety,
Tropical Fruit, and Wheat Breakfast with honey. There are many
others, but we do not give our birds any baby foods containing meats,
fish, poultry or vegetables. Most of the vegetable varieties contain
leek or onion, which we know from experience of hand-rearing other
parrot species, can be most upsetting to delicate avian stomachs.
To these Milupa foods we add glucose, or occasionally cane sugar,
brown ground rice, ground brown semolina (a kind of ground wheat),
and ground oats, which the birds particularly enjoy. We make up the
mixture in the proportion of half Milupa foods, one-eighth part
glucose or cane sugar, and the other foods make up the whole
quantity. To this we add a vitamin and mineral mix. There are many
on the market, and many countries have a large selection from which
to choose. Most of these tonics have a large proportion of Vitamin A,
which is very important for lories and lorrikeets.
All the year round the birds are given either lettuce, endive or
watercress, also flowers in bloom such as fuchsia, small flowered
single begonias, the type used as bedding plants (Begonia semper-
florens ), honeysuckle, single roses, pansies, wallflowers, in fact any
flower which contains nectar (not all do) and provides pollen, and
which is not poisonous. We have been told by a bee keeper that the
flowers, nectar, and pollen of rhododendons are all poisonous. We do
not give our birds either daffodils or dahlias, but they are given,
throughout the summer, the flowers of impatiens ("Busy Lizzies");
they are extremely fond of these brightly coloured flowers, especially
the red ones, and we wonder if perhaps this has something to do with
the bright red colour our birds have retained.
We soon discovered that these small lories are avid wood eaters.
A small branch of willow about 18&amp;quot; (45.5cm) long containing the
delectable green buds they crave so much will be devoured during
one day, leaving only a stick with no bark, all the buds eaten, and the

leaves consigned to the floor. Our birds are given both willow, and
apple, also hazel as often as possible during the winter months.
Right from the start of their introduction to dry food all our birds
are accustomed to peeled apple, pear, and also peeled grapes; cut up
finely and given fresh twice per day on top of the dry food. The
quantities are small and a little glucose is sprinkled on top to
encourage the birds in the early stages. Later this extra glucose can be
left out and the fruit can be lightly shaken into the dry food mixture.
During March 1989 our first pair of Wallace&amp;apos;s ( obiensis) went to
nest. They played a great deal, rather like puppies, rolling over and
over on the perches and then the cock would blow himself up to his
full height and puff out his feathers to make himself look larger.
Mating always took place on a perch, never on the floor, in fact they
seldom went on the floor except to bathe.
Two eggs were laid and about 23-24 days later two chicks were
hatched. The parents looked after them with great care, until disaster
struck one very cold night. We think either a cat or a fox frightened
the parents badly and they must have left the nest and not returned.
In the morning I found two very frightened and distressed parent
birds and two babies dead, untouched in any way and with full crops.
These wonderful little birds appeared to be absolutely heart-broken,
and the little hen sat on the perch almost crying, her beautiful little
eyes blinking. For some weeks it seemed as though nothing would
console her, in spite of all the cock's attention and caresses.
Eventually on I6th May it was discovered that this same hen had
laid again, two eggs as before, and on 6th June 1989 I found two
strong little babies in the nest. Two days later one died, although
there seemed to be no reason for its death. The other chick thrived
and was well fed and tended by the parents. Photo transparencies of
the chick and its parents were taken at intervals from a very early age,
some show the baby in the nest with quills just appearing, others
taken later present a charming picture of the parents watching the
photo being taken (from the inspection door) by looking through
their nest box entrance hole! The young bird was seen by Cyril
Laubscher, and by June and Paul Bailey.
During the summer months the young one made steady progress,
and by 6th July it was showing bright crimson on its head and crimson
and black on the wings. Simon Joshua of Databird Worldwide
Scientific Ltd chromosome sexed the young bird, and it proved to be
a male. He came out of the*nest on 8th August and was constantly fed
by the parents. He returned to the nest to sleep with his parents at
night.

In September the young male was gradually accustomed to
spending the day in the adjoining aviary, one of similar size and type
to that of his parents. He could feed himself by then during the day,
but for some time returned to his parents each night, to be promptly
pumped nearly to bursting point with food by his father and then to
disappear into his parents' nest-box for the night. After about two
weeks his mother clearly thought he should stay in his own aviary and
he quickly became used to being shut in the half house for the night
with its comfortable light giving out a very slight warmth.
By mid-October the young bird was almost the size of his parents,
but of course slimmer. His colouring from the beginning had always
been almost identical with the parents except for a rather "speckled"
appearance on the breast and around the cheeks, due to some slight
brown and purple "lacing" to the feathers with just one or two of a
green appearance. Now in the autumn of 1989 this lacing is dis-
appearing and he is gradually assuming full adult plumage.
These birds are obviously double brooded and are most excellent
and attentive parents, displaying a quite touching concern about the
well being of their offspring. Unfortunately a disproportionate
number of cocks came into the country, but we hope very much that
those owners who have one or more pairs of sexed birds will make
every endeavour to breed from them. Hopefully then in due time
sufficient numbers will be available to propagate healthy strains of
these charming and confiding birds.
As described above, Wallace's Lory Eos squamata obiensis has been bred by Mr.
and Mrs. F. Cooke and this is thought to be the first success in this country. Anyone
who knows of a previous breeding in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, or of any
other information that would disqualify this claim, is asked to write to the Hon.
Secretary as soon as possible.

of a new albatross Diomedea amsterdamensis ; a hitherto unknown
pheasant Lophura hatinhensis found in Vietnam during 1964; also in

1988 after many experts had written it off as extinct since 1930.
Less well known, however, is that dozens of other unusual bird
forms have been reported over a similar period that continue to elude
formal detection and identification by scientists. A number of these,
furthermore, have the potential for becoming (if and when they are
finally discovered) some of the most impressive ornithological finds
in many decades. This article therefore sets out to recall and reveal a
selection of some of the more interesting and potentially significant of
these mystery birds, and also to point out that certain of them may
have been allowed to slip into extinction without receiving due
attention by science.
The New Guinea birds of paradise are among the most exotic and
ethereal of all avian forms. Although 40 species are currently
recognised, skins of additional, controversial forms have also been
collected - and sometimes formally named. These include: Paradis-
aea bloodi, P. maria , Cicinnurus goodfellowi, Parotia duivenbodei ,
Epimachus ellioti, Janthothorax bensbachi, Neoparadisaea ruysi, and
Pseudastrapia lobata. Yet in line with the pronouncement in 1930 by
avian specialist Erwin Stresemann that 18 such types were merely
hybrids, all of these (plus a further six types collected more recently)
are nowadays denied formal status as separate species.
Although many of these mystery birds of paradise are unmistake-
ably intermediate in appearance between certain pairs of genuine

species, there are also examples that defy ready classification as
hybrids. One prime example from this latter category is Elliot&amp;apos;s
Sicklebill - a silky-plumed, long-tailed form that received the name
Epimachus ellioti when first discovered, and whose claim for recogni-
tion as a valid species has recently been championed by Errol Fuller
in his Extinct Birds. Stresemann had postulated that E. ellioti was the
result of hybridisation between the Black Sicklebill E. fastosus and
the Arfak Astrapia Astrapia nigra , but as Fuller has pointed out, in
stark contrast to genuine hybrid forms E. ellioti exhibits a number of
morphological features not possessed by either of its putative paren-
tal species. Most striking of these dissimilarities is its diminutive size -
notably smaller than any accepted species of sicklebill or astrapia (in
contrast, bona fide hybrids are often larger than both of their parental
species).
Consequently, it is by no means inconceivable that E. ellioti is
truly a distinct species. Moreover, the late bird of paradise expert Dr.
Thomas Gilliard was optimistic that unrecognised new species did
still exist in remote New Guinea localities. It should also be remem-
bered that one of the most spectacular of all species, the Ribbon-
tailed Bird of Paradise Astrapia meyeri (with a pair of white tail
feathers measuring up to a yard in length!) was unknown to science
until as recently as 1939.
Even more mysterious - being represented not by whole skins but
instead by a single feather - is the Two-banded Argus Pheasant. In
the 8th April, 1871 issue of The Field , T.W. Wood documented a
remarkable feather, which, although superficially similar to plumes
from the Great Argus Pheasant Argusianus argus, nonetheless
differed from the latter in several important ways. One of the most
significant of these was its possession of an elongated area of
chocolate coloration dotted with white, which was present not only
upon the broad web of the feather (as in corresponding wing
primaries of A. argus) but also upon the narrow web. As a result of
this, Wood christened its undescribed owner Argus [now Argusianus]
bipunctatus . Since then, this mystery bird has been sought on several
occasions in Java (presumed by some to be its provenance) by
ornithologists, including the noted pheasant expert Jean Delacour,
but no specimen has ever been located, thus inducing Delacour to
predict that it was now most probably extinct.
His belief was reiterated in 1983 by G.W.H. Davison, writing in
the British Ornithologists Club's Bulletin. Moreover, after closely
examining the lone A. bipunctatus feather, he inferred from its
markedly limp, flexible structure and certain other morphological

features that it had poor aerodynamic properties, and that this
species was in all probability flightless. As for its provenance,
Davison dismissed Java in favour of the offshore, eastern Malaysian
island of Tioman, for as A. argus is absent from here, there would be
no interspecific competition. Furthermore, Tioman was not zoologi-
cally explored until 1899 - almost 30 years after the single A.
bipunctatus feather was first recorded. Hence, if the species became
extinct sometime prior to 1899, that would explain why it has never
been observed by ornithologists.
Also requiring attention is a smaller but no less mysterious
fowl-like bird of South-East Asia - the alovot of Simalur (Sumatra).
According to a Temminckia report by Dr. Edward Jacobson, pub-
lished in 1937, the alovot is of chicken shape and size, sometimes said
to bear a small comb on its head (perhaps present only in the male?),
with short legs, and a dark-brown plumage decorated with lighter
spots. A denizen of the island's densest forests, apparently it is
extremely shy, so that only a few natives have ever sighted it,
although many are familiar with its constantly repeated clucking call.
It supposedly feeds on rice from the ricefields at night, but if
surprised it will take to the air at once, albeit via a low, heavy flight
(suggesting a move towards flightlessness?). Another noteworthy
feature concerning the alovot is that its nest is built on or close to the
ground - unlike that of any other Sumatran bird, according to Dr.
Jacobson. What could the alovot be?
If only chicken-sized, then it is much smaller than A. argus , which
also inhabits Sumatra. Curiously Jacobson considered that it most
closely resembled the Crestless Fireback Pheasant Acomus [now
Lophura] erythrophthalma. Yet its brown, ocellated plumage, gener-
al size, and possession of a comb (crest?) are all features much more
reminiscent of some peacock-pheasants ( Polyplectron spp.). Whatev-
er its specific identity, the recent discovery of Vietnam's Lophura
hatinhensis readily emphasises that unknown species of pheasant
could still be awaiting detection in southern Asia.
Another mystifying and sizeable gallinaceous bird is the du,
featured in native New Caledonian mythology. At first, it was
assumed that the du was indeed nothing more than a legend, with no
relationship to any real bird form. However, in February 1985,
Frangois Poplin and Cecile Mourer-Chauvire reported in Geobios
that native descriptions of the du tally very closely with reconstruc-
tions (based upon fossil evidence) of Sylviornis neocaledoniae. This
was a turkey-sized terrestrial species possibly related to modern-day
megapodes or mound-builders. Its fossil remains were first disco-

vered in 1974, and date at 3470 +/- 210 years BP (Before Present Day).
Indeed, the two researchers now believe that it was not exterminated
by the region s first human settlers, but became preserved within
native memory as the du. They also suggest that it may have been
responsible for the island's strange, mound-like tumuli.
In Fatu Hiva , noted explorer Thor Heyerdahl mentioned the
koao , a peculiar, wingless bird from Hiva Oa, one of the Marquesas
Islands in the Pacific, which cannot be identified with any known
species of bird alive today. In his checklist of apparently unknown
animals published in 1986 by Cryptozoology , Dr. Bernard Heuvel-
mans noted that the koao resembles a rail in appearance, but stated
that it is bigger than the island&amp;apos;s only known rail species, Porzana
tabuensis (which in any case seems to have died out here in recent
times). In addition, having studied the koao case closely and written a
scientific paper on the subject in the early 1980s, avian researcher
Michel Raynal has postulated that it may be closely related to the
Takahe Notonus mantelli. This is, of course, the famous flightless rail
of New Zealand whose rediscovery in December 1948 after 50 years
of &amp;apos;'extinction&amp;quot; created a scientific sensation worldwide. Who knows,
perhaps some future ornithological investigation on Hiva Oa may

engender a repetition of history!
Worth recalling is that as recently as the early 1980s, a totally new
species of flightless rail was discovered. Hailing from the Japanese
Ryukyu island of Okinawa, and accordingly named Rallus okinawae ,
this species has a very attractive plumage with prominent markings,
making all the more mysterious the manner in which it has succeeded
in evading scientific detection for so long.
Another flightless, insular bird that could certainly create a
sensation is the so-called Giant Kiwi or roa-roa , reported by Ferdi-
nand von Hochstetter during the latter part of the 19th Century from
New Zealand's South Island. Three species of kiwi are currently
known to science, all of which are far smaller than the turkey-sized
roa-roa , which additionally possesses sharp spurs - a feature not
exhibited by any known kiwi. As a result of such discrepancies,
Heuvelmans is very sceptical that the roa-roa is a kiwi at all,
proposing instead a more controversial but very exciting alternative
identity. Namely, that it is a surviving species of moa, quite possibly
of the genus Megalapteryx , whose species were indeed turkey-sized.
Although most authorities consider that the more famous, ostrich-
like Dinornis died out 300-400 years ago, some believe that Megalap-
teryx didinus was alive as recently as the mid-1800s. Consequently,
there is a possibility that a small moa species - probably nocturnal
and relatively inconspicuous amongst New Zealand's dense forests -
may indeed have persisted into the present day, undetected by
science, just like the Takahe. Moreover, in terms of structure such
moas as these compared closely to extra-large kiwis ( Megalapteryx
translates as "big kiwi"), providing further reason for equating them
with the roa-roa.
Despite many reports of expeditions intent upon seeking a living
moa, most have succeeded only in imitating their flightless quarry -
by failing to get off the ground! However, one notably intriguing moa
hunt did take place. In the late 1970s, a Japanese research team set
out in search of just such a bird, in a bold attempt to disprove the
sceptics, and using a very ingenious "bait". By meticulous study of
the neck and throat structure of Megalapteryx (using well-preserved
fossil specimens) in conjunction with the latest computer techniques
for reconstructing or creating three-dimensional structures, the team
was actually able to determine, and thence reproduce, the sound that
such a bird would have made! And so, armed with their remarkable
"lure", plus the equally extraordinary news that, according to locals,
such a cry had indeed been heard in recent times in the Fjordland
region of New Zealand's South Island, the intrepid team set out.

While exploring Fjordland's forests and marsh regions, the reconsti-
tuted moa call was played at regular intervals, in the hope of enticing
a living specimen into view. The expedition's forays were filmed, and
later featured in a variety of television programmes, not only in Japan
but also far afield abroad. Yet sadly, as one programme's narrator
remarked, the Japanese team's moa cry failed to elicit any reply.
A mystery bird that may prove to be a very different form from
those hitherto discussed here is the notorious devil-bird of Sri Lanka.
It derives its sinister name from its truly hideous cry - more
compatible with a banshee than a bird, and a source of considerable
fear amongst the island's native peoples - which has been likened to
the horrific shrieks that would be voiced by a boy being slowly
strangled!
A number of identities have been put forward for this macabre
creature, including the Sri Lankan Wood Owl Strix leptogrammica
ochrogenys, the Sri Lankan Eagle Owl Bubo nipalensis blighi , and
any one of the island's several species of nightjar. Yet none of these is
ultimately satisfactory. The Wood Owl is so familiar a bird here that
it seems inconceivable that this species could be responsible for such
eldritch cries without the fact having been scientifically verified.
Moreover, as with the Eagle Owl, its shape does not match that
ascribed to the devil-bird. In one of his noted 19th century works on
Sri Lanka, Sir Emerson Tennent referred to a Mr. Mitford - a Sri
Lankan inhabitant well-acquainted with the island's varied avifauna,
and an enthusiastic seeker of the devil-bird. As well as having heard
the latter's blood-curdling cries, Mitford was fortunate enough to spy
two birds that he believed to have been of this mysterious species
(sightings of devil-birds are generally very rare). He described them
as being of pigeon stature, with long tails. Whereas this description
agrees fairly well with certain nightjars, the latter birds' apparent
inability to produce the devil-bird's hideous cries serves to eliminate
these from serious consideration too.
So how can the devil-bird be explained? It is not impossible that a
totally unknown species of owl (or even nightjar) exists in Sri Lanka's
little-known low-country jungles, protected from human interference
by the superstitious horror that its spine-chilling cry engenders.
According to the late Indian authority Dr. Salim Ali, a still-
unidentified owl form may exist upon the Solomon and Nicobar
Islands; moreover, at least four new owl species (including one
requiring the creation of an entirely new genus - Xenoglaux ) have
been discovered within the past 30 years. Also worthy of mention is a
comparable case from Australia. For many years, the originator of

Equally baffling are the three colossal nests discovered sometime
between 1821 and 1823 by James Burton on the Egyptian coast of the
Red Sea. According to the pseudonymous(?) "Bonomi", in an
American Journal of Science report from 1845, the local Arabs
alleged that these had been constructed by giant stork-like birds.
Although no such bird is known today, "Bonomi" noted that a
painted basso-relievo of a gigantic stork - with white plumage, long
tail feathers, and a tuft at the back of its head - is sculptured on the
wall in the tomb of an officer from Pharoah Shufu's household.
Moreover, ancient records from this same period of Egypt's history
report that such birds were occasionally caught by peasantry of the
delta.
This brief selection of modern-day mystery birds demonstrates
that the age of major ornithological discoveries may not have passed
by. There could still be a number of sizeable species of bird awaiting
formal scientific discovery and description; equally, there might also
be other species waiting to emulate Jerdon's Courser and the
Madagascan Serpent Eagle, to be dramatically resurrected from
extinction. Clearly then, it is to be hoped that future ornithological
expeditions to relatively remote areas of the world will take every
opportunity to follow up local reports of unfamiliar bird forms, for by
doing so the scientific world may well become acquainted with an
even greater variety of avifauna than is currently recognised.

NOTES ON THE COMMON PHEASANT

The Common Pheasant, or more simply just the Pheasant, Pha-
sianus colchicus , is found naturally from around the Caspian Sea to
Japan (Harrison, 1988) and has been widely introduced to most of
Europe, North America, New Zealand, Hawaii and elsewhere. For a
very full account of its history as an introduced bird, I recommend Sir
Christopher Lever's fine book on introduced birds of the world.
Earlier thought, and claimed, to have been introduced into Britain
by the Romans, who certainly kept it as a captive bird at home in
Italy and may well have done so in their colonies too, more recent
opinions are that the Saxons (Lever) or the Normans (Harrison) were
responsible for introducing and establishing it in Britain.
That there has been, and to some extent still is, argument and
disagreement as to who introduced this splendid bird here seems to
be due to the lack of any positive evidence in the matter.
I have long thought it at least possible that the Pheasant may have
been native to this country albeit rare or at least local but will say no
more about this generally derided theory here.
The Pheasant originally here was certainly similar to or identical
with the form found in and around the Caucasus, whence it is known
the bird was brought to Greece and Rome in ancient time. This race,
Phasianus c.colchicus, is indeed often referred to as "the Old English
Blackneck&amp;quot; in contradistinction to the Chinese Ringneck, P.c. tor-
quatus , which was introduced in the late 18th century onwards, the
various other races such as the so-called Mongolian Pheasant,
P.c.mongolicus, from Russian Turkestan, the Green Pheasant, P.c.
versicolor , from Japan and various other races that were later
introduced and the hybrid offspring that resulted for, so far as is
known, all forms of Phasianus interbreed freely when they meet as a
result of human manipulation.
Personal involvement:
When I was 16 I was given five Pheasant's eggs by a friendly
farmer who had found them, in August, a very late clutch, when
harvesting. I put them under a broody hen who duly hatched them
but managed to tread on one of the chicks and kill it. Two of the
others soon came to grief, I forget now how, but the other two, a cock

and a hen, prospered. They were delightfully tame, and when
wandering in the field next to our garden would come running
through the grass to my call and take food from my hand. Unfortu-
nately when they were about six weeks old they vanished, presum-
ably having fallen prey to a cat, fox or some other predator.
The following May I obtained seven Pheasants' eggs by my own
efforts but perhaps we had better not say how ... These, entrusted to
a Bantam hen, were all successfully hatched and reared. Like the
previous two they grew up perfectly tame (I mention this because
some aviculturists have found this species wild and shy in captivity)
and turned out to be two cocks and five hens. One of the advantages
of this bird is that the cocks obtain full plumage in their first autumn.
How I glutted my eyes and gloated as bright feather after bright
feather appeared on the two cock birds until they were in their full
glorious adult plumage.
One of them was mediocre, as Pheasants go, with a lot of
yellowish colour and a skimpy, narrow and much interrupted white
neck-ring. His brother, however, was as beautiful as any pheasant I
have ever seen, with a general rich red-bronze body plumage but with
a nearly complete and wide, white neck-ring. He looked superficially
very like a "Mongolian" Pheasant but had a golden red, rather than
an olive bronze lustre.
These birds were at first free in the garden with their foster parent
but later, and unwisely as it turned out, their wings were clipped and
they were kept in a large, open-topped pen which enclosed a privet
hedge, several birch trees and a lot of grass and short shrubbery.
At night the birds fluttered and climbed up onto the privet hedge
to roost but, alas, a Fox that broke in one night managed to reach
them and kill them all besides many ducks in another pen.
Since then my main involvement with living Common Pheasants
has been watching them in a free state. Common as the bird is, it
never fails to thrill me and I still cannot decide which is more
beautiful, the brilliant burnished plumage of the cock or the subtle
camouflage pattern of the hen, who usually has an exquisite mauvish
pink tinge to the feathers of her nape and hind neck which is only
noticeable when she is seen at close quarters.
One of my last jobs before I retired from the Sub-department of
Ornithology of the British Museum (Natural History) was to sort out
and revise the pheasant collection there. This involved closely
examining large numbers of specimens, in which almost all races of
this species were (and are) represented. A labour of love, and
enlightenment, which gave me a full idea of the wonderful number

and beauty of "variations on a theme" represented by the various
races of this species. A variety of plumage expressed chiefly in the
coloration and length of ear tufts of the cocks, for the hens of the
different races are much more like each other, differing mainly in the
extent and intensity of their dark (usually blackish) markings.
It also made clear to me that to give the Green Pheasant of Japan
specific status was illogical, at least unless several other species were
to be recognised, for, as I have described elsewhere (Goodwin,
1982), the Green Pheasant differs less in plumage characters from
pheasants from China and Burma then they do from those of Central
and Western Asia.
Description, Races:
The Chinese saying: "One picture is worth a thousand words" is
true if one is trying to give an adequate description of the Common
Pheasant. Though only the very best of pictures can give an adequate
impression of the full beauty of the complicated patterns, rich colour
tones and varying (both intense and subtle) glosses and highlights of
this bird's plumage.
However, I think I can safely assume that all of my readers will
have seen either living Common Pheasants or good pictures of them
and so will be able mentally to "fill in the gaps" if I here give only a
very brief and generalised description of the cocks of a few of the
better known races or subspecies. All of them are forms that have
(although they are not the only ones that have) been introduced into
Britain and, I think, the USA. They are also races that well illustrate
the extremes of difference within this widespread species.
The "Old English Blackneck&amp;quot; or Southern Caucasian Pheasant
Phasianus c.colchicus has the top of the head dark greenish, the rest
Df the head (except for areas of velvety, deep scarlet skin around the
syes) and neck glossy green and purple. The front of the lower neck
and breast are deep reddish brown with a rich coppery and purple
^loss, the hind neck, back and scapulars rather more golden but
similar in hue and much darker than in the ring-necked races from the
c ar East. The lower back and rump are mainly reddish brown and
aurple and the long, purplish-fringed central tail feathers are olive
arown, banded with blackish. Most of the body feathers are tipped or
idged with black. The wing coverts are mainly buffish brown.
There are two areas of feathers at either side of the head which are
usually inconspicuous but when the bird is in sexual or self assertive
nood are erected to form conspicuous ear-like tufts. At the same
ime the area of red facial skin is expanded and altered in shape (see

sketches).
The so-called Mongolian Pheasant P.colchicus mongolicus of
Russian Turkestan and Dzungaria, has whitish wing coverts, a broad
white collar, interrupted in front, very short "ear" tufts, and a
generally deep coppery chestnut body plumage with a peculiar but
attractive olive-green sheen or tinge. The black bars on its reddish
brown central tail feathers are much narrower and shorter than those
of P.c. colchicus.
Another of the "white-winged" group of races is the Prince of
Wales's Pheasant P.colchicus principalis. It has no white neck ring, is
predominantly reddish brown in plumage with dull reddish purple,
not black, tips to the feathers of the lower neck and breast. It is found
in Afghanistan and southern Turkestan.
The Ring-necked Pheasant Phasianus colchicus torquatus from
much of eastern China, has a pale greenish brown crown, white
supra-orbital stripes, a white neck ring, interrupted in front, the
feathers on its upper back and mantle are predominantly golden
yellow, contrasting with the mainly chestnut scapulars. The feathers
at the sides of its lower breast and on its flanks are light golden,
tipped with black and contrast sharply with the rich coppery chestnut
red of the centre of the breast and lower neck. The wing coverts are
mainly light bluish grey and the lower back and rump mainly a silvery
bluish green.
It is an even brighter looking bird and with more contrasting areas
of colour than the Blackneck. To the north of its range live the
Manchurian Pheasant P. colchicus pallasi and the Korean Ringneck
P.colchicus karpowi , both of which are rather paler and brighter and
have broader and uninterrupted white collars.
The Green or Japanese Pheasants include three very slightly
different races, P.colchicus versicolor, P.c.tanensis and P.c.robus-
tipes. They differ from P.c.torquatus, which they otherwise resemble
in several details of marking, in having no white on the neck, and the
mantle and back (but not the chestnut scapulars), breast and flanks
dark green or dark bluish green.
There are very many more races, all of beauty and interest but it
would take up too much space to describe them here. There are good
descriptions in Raethal (1988) and also briefer ones elsewhere.
Mutations and racial hybrids:
Three well known mutations have cropped up among the intro-
duced pheasants in England and Europe and have since been bred
widely on game farms and in aviaries.

Most notable, perhaps most notorious one might say, is the dark
form or Melanistic Mutant, var.tenebrosus. In its full state this form
has the cock predominantly dark blackish green and dark purple, and
the hen sooty brown or dark chestnut brown with a grous e-(Lagopus)
like rather than pheasant-like plumage pattern. Varying degrees of
melanism may be shown but usually melanistic birds are at once
obvious as such. Their chicks, instead of being the complicated
cryptic pattern of browns and buffs of normal Pheasant chicks are
dark with white areas on the head and so are, presumably, more
easily visible to predators. This is perhaps why although these
melanistic birds are said to be hardier than normal birds, no
melanistic form has evolved in a purely wild state.
The myth that this melanistic form is the result of hybridisation
with the Green Pheasant has been repeated by many ornithologists
who should have known better, or been willing to take the word of
Delacour, who did, and who has clearly shown its falsity. The
Melanistic Mutant is a colour variety comparable with the dark
chestnut varieties of the Common and Red-legged Partridges Perdix
perdix and Alectoris rufa, the dark mutant of the domesticated
Japanese Quail Coturnix japonica , or the Black East Indian Duck.
Anyone who takes the trouble to compare skins will see that the cock
bears only a very superficial resemblance to the Green Pheasant and
the hen none at all.
An apparent dilute variety, comparable to "silver" in domestic
Pigeons and "cinnamon" in Canaries, is usually called the Bohemian
Pheasant. In this variety the cock has all the normally golden, reddish
or chestnut feathers of a pale, slightly pinkish fawn, tipped with dull
greyish rather than glossy black or purple, and the normally glossy
dark green and purple parts of the head or neck are of a peculiar
dulled appearance. Except for its novelty, the Bohemian Pheasant
has little to recommend it, by comparison with normally coloured
birds.
The same is true, in my estimation, for the white variety, even
when, which is far from usually the case, the plumage is entirely white
with no odd coloured feathers here or there. Some writers have
enthused over the beauty of the snow white Pheasant with its
contrasting red facial skin. Certainly if their plumage is clean, such
birds are striking in appearance though not more than one of the
more shapely breeds of white Domestic Fowl (which could, of course,
be reared and kept more easily and cheaply). However I am perhaps
in a minority in this value judgement. Certainly those responsible for
filling public aviaries seem far more inclined to put white or piebald

Pheasants on show than the beautiful, normally coloured birds. Even
in one case a magnificent tame pair of Chinese Ringneck type
Pheasants was got rid of in favour of a wild and scruffy trio of piebald
birds.
The various races appear to interbreed freely wherever they are
brought into contact by man. One result of this, which became
apparent when I examined skins at the museum, is the production of
many cock birds which superficially bear a resemblance to the
Chinese Ringneck (and allied races) but are more uniformly pale and
golden in hue without strong contrast (as in the wild P.c.torquatus
and its allies) between the golden feathers on the flanks and the
darker, reddish feathers on the breast.
Though the generally pale golden coloration of such birds makes
them at first sight very unlike the Old English Blackneck or the
Mongolian, I wonder if genes from one or both of the latter that are,
perhaps, responsible for a more or less even coloration over upper
and underparts, are dominant over genes for contrasting flanks, etc.,
of the Ringneck but the latter's genes for pale golden or mantle and
flanks are responsible for the colour itself?
Be this as it may, such relatively uniform golden birds (with white
neck-ring and the usual green neck above it) are not, as is often
thought, identical with any wild ring-necked race of the species.

The Common Pheasant is often instanced as a species that is in no
danger because of the interest shown in it by Sportsmen (e.g.
Johnsgard). There can be no doubt that, as Robertson claims, its
numbers in Britain are greatly increased by the release of large
numbers of artificially reared young birds each year. In much of
Europe it is thought that the Pheasants would die out but for such
measures (Raethel, Schulte).
That in the past the Pheasant maintained itself in the wild state in
Britain is certain but it is less certain that it will always manage to do
so.
There is evidence that "reared" Pheasants, which are often kept
under very unnatural conditions, are less viable when free than
wild-bred birds (Robertson). So it is possible that the continual
addition of captive-reared birds to the stock may work against the
evolution of a type well suited to survive in the wild.
Sportsmen have ideas, which may or may not be valid, as to fitness
of different forms of Pheasants for their purposes. Schulte states that
the "Mongolian" race is the hardiest and least inclined to roam far.

the Ring-necked the best adapted to farmland, and the Black-necked
the least conspicuous to predators and the best adapted to a
European environment. I suspect the last idea may be prevalent in
Britain too as I have noticed, at least in parts of Kent, Surrey and
western Scotland, that most of the Pheasants one sees, and all of the
recently released birds, are of Blackneck type (more or less). A very
different situation to that before and immediately after the war when
most of the cock Pheasants I saw had complete or partial white neck
rings.
Unfortunately, because of its relationship to sport, the attitude of
many bird watchers to this beautiful and interesting species ranges
from complete lack of interest to passive, and occasionally even
active, hostility. It is unlikely that many of them would raise a finger
to save it if it were threatened. While, if by any chance some
supposedly better gamebird could be found to take its place, it is
unlikely that the sportsmen would be more concerned about its fate
than they are over that of Red-legged Partridge which they have been
happy to try to eliminate as a pure species because they believe that
Chukars and hybrids will serve their purpose better.
Tameness and wildness
The Common Pheasant has a generally bad reputation for wild-
ness in captivity. That in panic it will fly up with considerable force
and injure or even kill itself if the aviary top is of wire or solid
material is no doubt true. So will many other gamebirds. This can,
however, be prevented by clipping or partially clipping both wings so
the bird cannot rise with force. Clipping one wing will make it liable
to crash land awkwardly and hurt itself that way. However, so far as
general timidity is concerned, I do not think this is likely to be a
problem if a brood are reared under a Bantam and given plenty of
attention and hand-feeding with insects or other titbits. In the 1960s
there were many Pheasants in Kew Gardens that had become half
tame and before the war there were at least three in St James Park
that were absolutely tame and used to take food from people's hands
without the slightest sign of nervousness.
The most remarkable instance I saw of a wild Pheasant becoming
tame was of a fine cock that would come and take food from the little
son of some friends of mine. This bird only trusted the little boy; if he
saw either of his parents or any other adults he would flee at once and
yet he would come boldly up to the child to be fed by him.

Does the Common Pheasant feed her young?
In many gamebirds, including the Golden Pheasant, domestic
fowl, Common Partridge Perdix perdix , and Red-legged Partridge
Alectoris rufa, the mother, or both parents, call the young and give
them insects or other suitable food that they have found (although
the young also find a lot of food for themselves). I can find no positive
evidence for the hen Common Pheasant doing so and Robertson
implies the contrary. However, in view of the fact that the cock bird
feeds the hen (there is a lovely photograph of this in Raethel's book)
my guess is that observation would show that the hen Common
Pheasant is no exception to the general rule and that she does feed
her young. Can some of our members give definite information on
this?
Pheasant and Fox
I will end with a little anecdote. On the 21st June 1988. I was on a
valley side and heard on the other side the cho&amp;apos;tok! cho'tok alarm call
of a cock Pheasant. I saw at the wood edge on the opposite slope a
cock Pheasant on a strip of nearly bare ground. Suddenly a Fox came
out of the wood edge. The Pheasant walked quickly away ( but did not
run) until he was about 25 yards from the Fox. The Fox walked
towards the Pheasant but seemed not interested in it (knew he could
not catch it?) and soon vanished back into the wood edge. The
Pheasant then returned to where he had first been and suddenly I
noticed a hen there, who gave the sudden little hop which (I think)
indicates sexual interest as he displayed briefly to her. What struck
me was the relative lack of fear the Pheasant showed, compared with
how he would almost certainly have behaved had a man appeared
anywhere near him. He evidently thought, rightly, that as long as he
kept his eye on the Fox he was quite safe.

A VISIT TO SOME INDONESIAN ZOOS AND BIRD
MARKETS

For bird enthusiasts few experiences can match the thrill of
travelling to a foreign country to see exotic birds in their native
habitat. For zoo curators it is likewise exciting to visit foreign
zoological gardens, examine methods of exhibition, husbandry and in
many cases view species that we have never had the opportunity to
work with. In April 1989, while participating in meetings on the Bali
Mynah reintroduction project, the authors had the chance to visit
several zoos and bird markets in Indonesia. The notes below will
highlight our visit.
Kebun Binatang Ragunan (Jakarta Zoo)
Originally a small city zoo, Ragunan moved outside Jarkarta in
1964 and now comprises 200 well maintained hectares. Some two
million people visit this facility each year to view almost 3,800
animals representing 400 species. The zoo director, Linus Simanjun-
tak, DVM, who is also the editor of the Indonesian wildlife maga-
zine, Voice of Nature, heads a staff of four curators, several veterina-
rians and 200 keepers. A one-billion Rupiah (575,000 U.S. dollars)
budget is partially achieved through gate receipts as well as the sale ot
"zoo-doo" which is packaged and sold throughout Jakarta as a plant
fertilizer. A 2kg bag sells for about lOOORp (about 60 U.S. cents).
The 1987-1988 inventory (ending 31st March, 1988) lists the bird
collection as follows: 16 orders, 38 families, 201 species and 1,988
specimens. Glancing at these numbers we were amazed that each

species averaged 100 specimens! However, translation of the Indone-
sian column headings indicate that these numbers reflect many free
flying residents of the park such as 250 Little Black Cormorant
Phalacrocorax sulcirostris , 263 Black-crowned Night Heron Nycticor-
ax nycticorax , 175 Spotted Dove Streptopelia chinenis , 50 Yellow-
vented Bulbul Pycnonotus goiavier, 50 Pied Starling Sturnus contra ,
etc. Although the collection did not include a large number of
endangered species, it did provide us with an excellent look at many
Indonesian and regional species. Of particular interest are 20 species
of pigeons and doves, 41 species of parrots and seven hornbill
species.
Further information on the collection can be obtained from Dr.
Simanjuntak or the Curator of Birds, Abdullah Baab.
Kebun Binantang Surabaya (Surabaya Zoo)
Located near the centre of Surabaya, this 16-hectare zoo is under
the direction of Stany Soebakir. The animal collection consists of
approximately 3000 specimens representing 325 species. Most popu-
lar with the two million annual visitors are the breeding display of
Komodo Dragons, the onsite aquarium and museum and the Bali
Mynah propagation facility. Also worthy of note are the Javan Grey
Gibbons Hylobates moloch , Babarusa Babyrousa babyrousa, Ba-
wean deer Axis kuhli , Javan Warty Pig Sus verrucosus , several
species of Anoa and a large collection of Bornean Orang-utan Pongo
p. pygmaeus.
The bird collection (approximately 150 species and 1000 speci-
mens) is dominated by aquatic taxa including a breeding group of
Australian Pelicans Pelecanus conspicillatus. Other species of interest
include the Slaty Woodpecker Mulleripicus pulverulentus , Laced
Woodpecker Picus vittatus , and several Friar-birds Philemon sp.
As mentioned above, a highlight of the Surabaya Zoo is the Bali
Mynah propagation centre. This facility houses the 38 captive-
hatched birds sent to Surabaya from United States zoos in 1987 as
well as two pairs from the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust and 14
Indonesian birds. The offspring of these birds are sent to a pre-
release training centre in Bali Barat National Park prior to their
release into the wild. The first three birds were released in August
1988. For more information on this project see " Animal Kingdom "
magazine Vol.92:2 pp.38-43. or contact Bob Seibels at the River-
banks Zoo, Columbia, S.C. USA.

were not disappointed. Although the humidity and odour at midday
can be overpowering, the variety of species and the number of
individuals of certain species was truly overwhelming. As we walked
down dark aisles peering into overcrowded cages, we were besieged
continuously by salesmen. Even photographing individual birds
required payment in certain areas. With the assistance of Bas van
Balen, a field ornithologist in Indonesia, we compiled a species list
from the markets in both cities. This list along with comments where

Those readers planning a trip to Indonesia should also consider
visiting the Taman Mini bird park in Jakarta. We were quite
impressed with the large variety of Asian species on exhibit in the
walk-through aviaries. Unfortunately our visit was shortened by
heavy rains which closed the facility. Indentification of the birds at
the zoos and bird markets is best accomplished by using King's Field
Guide to the Birds of South-east Asia and John Mackinnon's Field
Guide to the Birds of Java and Bali. Current field work in Indonesia
can be followed in "Kukila" , the bulletin of the Indonesian Ornitho-
logical Society, P.O. Box 287 / JKSMG, Jakarta Selatan 12710A

To defend their avocation, aviculturists often refer to the salvation
of endangered species through captive reproduction. Two examples
are frequently cited: the Hawaiian Goose Branta sandvicensis and the
Bali Mynah Leucopsar rothschildi. Though neither species is yet
secure in the wild, both breed well in artificial situations, and their
responsiveness to avicultural management has ensured survival -- at
least in confinement. Reintroduction programmes, though beset with
political difficulties, have demonstrated effective cooperation among
public and private members of the avicultural community.
The status of island cockatoos now provides aviculturists with
opportunities to save species whose wild populations are almost
certainly beyond the point of natural recovery. Husbandry techni-
ques are well developed, and suitable numbers of specimens are
presently in captivity. To date, however, their critical situation in the
wild has received only limited publicity.

Though the vulnerability of island endemics to habitat alteration
or hunting pressure is well documented, the precipitous decline of
island cockatoos also results from over-harvest for aviculture, or,
more accurately, for the international pet trade.
Five species are seriously threatened (and are consequently
numerous in trade): Red-vented Cacatua haematuropygia, Lesser
Sulphur-crested (Citron-crested) C. sulphurea , Goffin's (Tanimbar)
C. goffini , Umbrella (White) C. alba, and Moluccan (Salmon-
Tested) C. moluccensis.
The Red-vented Cockatoo has become, within the last decade, the
3 hilippines' most threatened bird, second only to the Philippine
Monkey-eating) Eagle Pithecophaga jefferyi (Collar, 1989).
Though this species has not appeared in western trade as frequent-
y as the others, it is apparently being trapped and traded extensively
vithin its homeland.
Five subspecies of the Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoo occur on
he Indonesian islands off Sulawesi (Celebes), its satellite islands, and
he Lesser Sundas from Penida and Lombok east to Timor (Forshaw,
978). IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature)
locuments (in Collar, 1989) indicate that in 1984 and 1985 Indonesia
officially exported 2,986 and 3,990 specimens. CITES (Convention
&amp;gt;n International Trade in Endangered Species) member nations
ecord imports in those years of 6,415 and 7,884 birds, indicating that
luch larger numbers are leaving Indonesia than are officially re-
*orted. It is probable that additional specimens were exported to
on-CITES countries. And one can only speculate on mortality
ttendant on the capture of such numbers of wild birds (for which no
gures are recorded).
The Goffin s Cockatoo is endemic to the Tanimbar islands,
ndonesia, and is heavily trapped both for trade and to reduce maize
epredations. According to Low (1986), the islands were drastically
eforested in the 1970s and large-scale export of the species com-
lenced. Official export numbers for the years 1983 and 1984 were
,233 and 9,140 while CITES countries reported imports of 14,218
nd 10,945. Official export figures for 1985 and 1986 (no correspond-
lg import figures are available) -- 7,314 and 8,306 -- reflect the
lagnitude of continuing trade.
The Umbrella Cockatoo is found on Halmahera and adjacent
lands of the northern Moluccas, Indonesia. As recently as 1986,

flocks of over 30 birds were seen in some areas but had disappeared
by the following year (Collar and Andrew, 1988). It is reported to be
widely shot for food as well as trapped. Official exports for the years
1983 and 1984 were 6,395 and 8,698; CITES imports, 13,206 and
12,193 (Collar, 1989). In 1985 and 1986, Indonesia legally exported
7,164 and 7,884 (corresponding import figures are not available)
(Collar and Andrew, 1988).
The Moluccan Cockatoo was abundant until recently on Ceram
and nearby islands of the southern Moluccas, Indonesia, but it had
declined so drastically that in 1988 the Species Survival Commission
of the IUCN listed it among the twelve most critically endangered
species of animals and plants (Jackson, 1988). Officially exported
numbers for 1983 and 1984 were 6,415 and 7,655; CITES imports in
those years 9,625 and 9,639 (Collar, 1989). Legal exports for 1985
and 1986 were 7,525 and 7,360 (corresponding import figures are not
available) (Collar and Andrew, 1988).
Even within Manusela National Park (1800km 2 ) it is reported to
have become very scarce despite large areas of undisturbed habitat: a
survey conducted between July and September 1987, located what
appeared to be a maximum number of 20 individuals (Bowler and
Taylor, 1987).
Of large size, showy plumage and, when hand-reared, often
affectionate disposition, Moluccan Cockatoos are among the most
popular cage birds. Their reputation among aviculturists, however, is
of nervousness, and their breeding is considered more difficult to
induce than that of their congeners. In recent years, at least in the
United States, massive importations have caused the market value of
the birds to drop and this, with their unsteady temperament, has
discouraged many aviculturists from attempting to breed this species.
In zoos the mistaken notion persists that private aviculturists are
producing substantial numbers (as they are of many other psittacine
species) and that a non-breeding exhibit of Moluccan Cockatoos is
thereby justified. According to International Species Inventory Sys-
tem (ISIS) Abstracts of 31$t December 1988, 53 zoos listed the
species in total numbers of 63, 43, 35 (males, females, unsexed), yet
31 of these institutions listed only birds of one sex or of unknown sex.
Only 17% are known to be captive-hatched; only three birds were
reported hatched within the previous 12 months. Additional numbers
of potential breeders are doubtless held by zoos not listing the species
with ISIS.
Most captive birds -- no accurate estimates are available -- are

held by individual owners and private aviculturists, and it is hoped
that, as knowledge of these species' impending extinction in the wild
spreads, despite current market prices, more effort will be made to
develop management techniques for sustained breeding while num-
bers adequate to maintain genetic diversity are available.
Criticism will no doubt be levelled at the avicultural community
tor creating -- or at least for abetting (by implicit support of the pet
trade) -- the demand which threatens these birds. To uphold their
avocation's credibility, zoo curators and private aviculturists must
:ooperate to ensure successful maintenance and reproduction of
these species with genetic variability and in optimum numbers to
sustain reintroduction efforts should they become feasible. The very
existence of these unique, beautiful birds may be their responsibility.

This paper presents no new information. My intent is only to disseminate
knowledge to aviculturists for the reasons stated herein. Its inception arose in
:onversation with my friend Roland Wirth, chairman of the Zoologische Gessellschaft
ur Arten- and Populationschutz (Zool. Soc. for the Conservation of Species and
Populations), who had previously brought this information to the attention of German
iviculturists. Donald Bruning, chairman of the ICBP Parrot Specialist Group com-

\ note at going to press:
rhis article was submitted for publication in spring 1989.
Though the cockatoos' situation has doubtless not improved in the
time of going to press, some changes have occurred, most notably
the inclusion of the Salmon-crested Cockatoo on Appendix I of
CITES. It has also been suggested that additional threats, such as
introduced "Cockatoo beak- and feather feather-loss syndrome"
may impact island populations. It is hoped that new and more
thorough surveys will soon provide more accurate appraisals.

BIRDS. VOLUME 2: SEED EATING BIRDS.
Compiled by Neville Brickell. Illustrated by Rex M. Shirley. Pub-
lished by ARU, Republic of South Africa, 1989.
ISBN 0-620-12983-2. Two hundred and ninety-five page paperback,
23 colour photographs, including those on the covers, numerous
black and white illustrations, maps, etc.
A review of Volume I, appeared in the Avicultural Magazine , Vol.
93, No. 3, pp. 176-177. Volume I included the typical Waxbills,
Pytilias, Firefinches, Twinspots, a Crimsonwing, a Seedcracker,
Mannikins, Whydahs, Widow-birds, Weavers/Bishops (genus Eu-
plectes ), Queleas and Buntings.
The present volume brings together an assortment of other seed
eating species; namely, Francolins, Quail, Guineafowl, Button
Quail, Sandgrouse, Pigeons and Doves, Parrot species, Larks, Finch
Larks and various members of the Weaver family, including Spar-
rows and Petronias, not dealt with in the first volume.
This new volume, as before, takes in birds found in Africa south of
the Caprivi Strip. In effect, it means approximately the southern third
of Africa; it includes the Republic, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe
and Mozambique.
Contents come under the headings, Breeding, Housing, General
Management, Nutritional Principles, Feeding, Ailments and Dis-
eases, and Topography of a bird.
The species' accounts cover some 67 species and, where applic-
able, the races. Included among that number is 12 species of
Francolins, three Quail, 11 Pigeons and Doves. The Cape, Brown-
headed, Meyer&amp;apos;s or Brown and Ruppell's Parrots, with the Rosy-
faced, Lilian's and Black-cheeked Lovebirds, make up the Parrot
species. As well as the English and scientific names, there is each
species' Afrikaans name and alternative English names. There is a
description of each species and in some instances races as well. Their
range in southern Africa is given and each species' habitat is
described, so is their diet in the wild and in captivity in southern
Africa. Likely to be most helpful to bird-keepers is the descriptions of
the various species&amp;apos; nesting habits. Their more general habits/
behaviour are under the heading 'Behavioural/Characteristics'. In
some instances, predators are listed, eg. readers are told Meyer's or
the Brown Parrot, may be preyed on by the Peregrine Falcon.

graphs show 22 species. Both male and female Tambourine Dove are
shown, though unfortunately, separately in different parts of the
book, not even on consecutive pages, so they could be more easily
compared. Many of the other species are the subject of monochrome
illustrations. Most work well; some, eg. Ruppell's Parrot (p. 152) and
the Red-billed Buffalo Weaver (p. 179), I find especially attractive. A
few are not so successful.
The final part includes a miscellaneous assortment of information.
Included is a list of hybrids, notes about photographing and showing
birds, followed by the Show Rules and Regulations of the South
African National Cage Bird Association. There are details of places
in southern Africa likely to interest bird-keepers, also a list of Bird
Clubs and Associations in South Africa and Zimbabwe. In addition
there is what appears to be a fairly comprehensive account of the laws
as they relate to wild birds in that part of the world.
Some information is included in both volumes. This may irk
purchasers of the two, but on the positive side, means both volumes
are self-sufficient in their own right.
I understand Volume 2 will be available from about five outlets
here in Britain. I do not have a price for it. I suggest that enquiries
are addressed to:- Neville Brickell, Avicultural Research Unit, 100
Innes Road, Durban 4001, Natal, South Africa.

June and Paul Bailey write from Dorking, Surrey, to report the
parent-reared breeding of Fairy Lories Charmosyna pulchella.
They believe that this is the first parent-reared breeding since that
of E.J. Brook in 1914 although they say that Data Birds have hatched
and hand-reared two this year (1989). The young bird was seen in the
nest by fellow Avicultural Society members Mr. and Mrs. F. Cooke
and Mr. Cyril Laubscher.

(Avicultural Magazine , Vol. 91, No. 3, pp. 162-165, 1985). Since it
was published a few readers have enquired whether the Niam Niam
Parrot was introduced to Mozambique or if escapees had been
recaptured as the range of this species is the eastern Cameroons,
Central African Republic and southern Sudan. The confusion arises
in the translation from Portuguese where it reads in the article. "In
Mozambique three recently caught .long."
"In 1987, shortly before his death, I met Joao at Bangassou airport
where he informed me that the birds were trapped by a fellow truck
driver whose home was a village at Yel. He delivered the birds to the
coast. The birds were purchased by N. Bicknell in Kenya where they
eventually ended up in the aviaries of the Joao family in Mozambi-
que. In 1975 the wire on all the aviaries was slashed to give the
impression that the birds had been allowed to escape, but he believed
that they were stolen that night. One of the hybrids had been

"I have just heard from a friend in Australia about the results of
the breeding season just closed (1989). Being a very busy business
man with a lot of travelling he was unable to devote the attention to
his birds they needed (sounds familiar so far, doesn't it) so he decided
to run his aviaries together forming just two large flights. He reports
that he bred Pin-tailed Whydahs and Red-shouldered Whydahs and

various bishops and grenadiers. The Pin-tailed Whydahs '.were
not so successful as in previous years and we only bred five, but that's
better than none'.
"He then goes on to enumerate the smaller finches: Rufous-
backed Mannikins, over 15; Cutthroats, over 20; Tri-coloured
Munias, over eight. White-headed Munias, over 10; Cordon-bleus,
over 20. His success with the common waxbills made me smile with
appreciation: '...Orange-breasted Waxbills, Firefinches and St. Hele-
na Waxbills, heaps (over 50 each); Black-headed Siskins, over 20;
Red Siskins, 21; Green Singing Finches, 6; Tree Sparrows, 8; Crested
Masked Finches, over 40; Jacarini Finches, over 20; Bichenos, over
20; and a few quail.
"Clearly for the breeder, David Holmes, it wasn't a very good
season and he explained the steps he was taking to improve matters
for next year. Oh yes, those aviaries,... they're 96&amp;apos; (29.26m) long; one
is 53&amp;apos; (16.15m) wide and the other a mere 20&amp;apos; (6.09m) wide."
Robin continues: "I am working on what I intend to be the most
comprehensive guide possible to the munias and mannikins genus
Lonchura. For example, every species, subspecies and distinct female
and juvenile will be illustrated in colour, and there will be many
drawings aiding sexing and showing behaviour, etc. However, there
are inevitably some blank areas, and these can only be filled by help
from aviculturists who have kept or are keeping the birds. I would be
more than grateful for any munia enthusiast with experience, howev-
er slight (it's amazing how even the smallest item of information can
help) of the following species would write to me please: Lonchura
leucogastra (white-bellied), L. monticola (Alpine), L. vana (New
Guinea Grey-headed), L. montana (Snow Valley), L. tristissima
(Streaked-headed), or any other unusual munia.
"Further to my notes on L. quinticolor in "Reminiscences of
Munias" (Vol. 95, Nos. 3 and 4). I have established that the bird with
the golden rump is L.q. quinticolor from Timor. The maroon-red-
rumped bird is L.q. wallacii from Bali and Lombok. I will write
further about this species in due course."

most gamebirds. A possible Swedish first breeding of the Hazelhen is
worth mentioning and a good number of Blackcock, Ptarmigan and
Capercaillie were bred. The latter is now being produced in such
large numbers that some breeders have problems in selling their
surplus stock. Brown Eared Pheasants and Satyr Tragopans also did
well.
I had true pairs of 17 species. Out of these, 14 went to nest but
only nine were successful. The following young birds were reared:

THE AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE welcomes original articles that
have not been published elsewhere and that essentially concern the avi-
culture of a particular bird or group of birds, or that describe their
natural history. Articles should be preferably typewritten, with double
spacing, and the scientific names as well as the vernacular names of birds
should be given. References cited in the text should be listed at the end
of the article. Line drawings should be in Indian ink on thick paper or
card; black and white photographs which illustrate a particular point in
the article will be used where possible and should be clearly captioned. If
authors wish their eventual return, they must say so when submitting the
article and write their name on the back of each photograph.

BIRD-REARING AND ARRIVALS TO THE COLLECTION

(Curator of Birds)
Over the three year period 1987 to 1989, 96 species of birds were reared
from a total of 109 species which hatched chicks. Some species were success-
ful in one year but not in another and several species that bred in earlier years
are no longer represented in the collection. Our best year for breeding results
was 1988 when 65 species reared a total of 269 chicks. However, where artifi-
cial incubation and rearing were involved, this over-stretched our resources
and in 1989 we were more selective in our choice of species for intensive hus-
bandry.
Ostriches Struthio camelus were hatched in 1987 and 1988 but only one
was reared to maturity. Since then both partners of our breeding pair have
died; the female after 19 years in the collection. However, several of their 11
offspring from 1984 have now themselves become breeders including a
female at Paignton Zoo which reared chicks in 1989.
Our Emus Dromaius novaehollandiae, hatched and reared a batch of six-
teen young in 1988. It proved so difficult to place these youngsters that we
prevented them breeding by removing all their eggs in 1989. Common Rheas
Rhea americana reared chicks in all three years. A recent male Rhea received
on loan from Paignton Zoo proved a model parent in defence of his young. We
were concerned that the Rhea chicks may have been taken by a problem Fox
Vulpes vulpes but having seen the proud father "defend" his progeny from the
Guanaco Lama guanicoe and Chinese Water Deer Hydropotes inermis which
share the paddock, quickly realised there was little need for concern.
Chilean Tinamous Nothoprocta perdicaria continue to be bred. From our
original stock of four birds imported in 1980 a total of over 160 have now
been reared, of which the majority have been sent to other zoos and private
collections. With such a small number of founders it will be interesting to see
how long this population may succeed.
In the last three years our flamingo flock has grown by breedings and
acquisitions from 24 Caribbean Flamingos Phoenicopterus ruber and 18

Chilean Flamingos P. chilensis to a total of over 70 birds. Details of breedings
up to 1988 were reported in a previous article in the Avicultural Magazine
(Wilkinson, 1989). A further three Caribbeans were reared in 1989 when we
had our first success in hatching and rearing a Chilean Flamingo. Work is cur-
rently progressing in building a new area to permit the Chileans to be held
separately from the Caribbeans. Last year three hybrid pairs were observed,
each of which was prevented from hatching hybrids by egg removal and
replacement with either wooden dummies or abandoned eggs from non-hybrid
pairings.
Night Herons Nycticorax nycticorax and Sacred Ibis Threskiornis aethiopi-
cus both reared young in the big flight in 1988. It was therefore with some
regret that these birds, together with our Silver Gulls Larus novaehollandiae
and Grey-headed Gulls Larus cirrocephalus were moved to Penscynor in early
1989 in order that the endangered Waldrapp Ibis Geronticus eremita could
have sole occupation of the flight. Our colony now comprises some 20
Waldrapp, the majority of which are still too young to breed, although several
pairs laid eggs in 1988 and 1989. j
We had hoped that the Sacred Ibis could be used as fosters for the more dif-
ficult Waldrapps. Although this was attempted in 1988 the more robust Sacred
Ibis proved to be too much of a nuisance in disturbing the Waldrapps by steal-
ing their nest material. The attempt at cross-fostering however was instructive.
In 1988 a pair of Waldrapps which hatched a chick from their first clutch re-
nested at the same time as one of the Sacred Ibis pairs. The Waldrapp chick
had died shortly after hatching, apparently not fed by its parents. We therefore
swapped eggs between the two species. The Sacred Ibis proved better parents
than the Waldrapps in hatching two chicks and rearing one to five days. Post-
mortem indicated that this Waldrapp chick had been fed with sand and gravel
resulting in impaction of the proventriculus. The Waldrapp amazed us by
hatching and successfully rearing the Sacred Ibis chick. It would seem that
Sacred Ibis chicks are more robust than the Waldrapps. Hoping that this expe-
rience in rearing had been beneficial to the Waldrapps we gave them another
chance in 1989. However, although three chicks were hatched, all again died
within days of hatching.
If captive Waldrapp Ibis are to be used in reintroduction programmes then
parent-reared birds are likely to be a better proposition than those that are
hand-reared. Although our target is to establish a Waldrapp colony sustainable
by parent-rearing it seems we may have to hand-rear, at least in the short-term, 1
if we are to maintain our colony at its present numbers.
Our policy of hand-rearing Humboldt Penguins Spheniscus humboldti
which resulted in 16 chicks reared in 1986, has continued with 13, 19 and 8
chicks respectively hand-reared in the last three years. Perhaps we should now
again be addressing the question of why the parents previously failed in rear-

ing their own chicks, although at least at present our concern is to maintain a
captive population without the complications of the needs of reintroduction
programmes.
White Storks Ciconia ciconia on loan to us from Bristol Zoo, bred for the
first time at Chester in 1989. Three chicks were hatched of which two were
successfully reared. Because we had not observed the parents feeding the
chicks we decided to assist by supplementary feeding of the youngsters in the
nest. Accordingly over the first week the chicks were fed by syringe with
Penguin hand-rearing mixture, essentially liquidised sprats with vitamin and
mineral supplements. This food was later left on the side of the nest. The
chicks readily accepted this method of presentation which we later discovered
mimicked the feeding behaviour to the nestlings of the adults. Concern was
felt when one of the parents was seen to attempt to feed the chicks on veg-
etable material that looked like grass clippings, but could have been algae
from the side of their pond. No mention of vegetable food is given in recent
literature. Cramp and Simmons (1977) note that the diet of White Storks is
'exclusively animal' reporting that wild nestlings are fed initially on grasshop-
pers and lizards and later on frogs and snakes. Similarly Brown et al (1982)
record the White Storks diet as being 'entirely animal'. Our fear that the feed-
ing of vegetable matter by the parents to the chicks might result in impaction
of the alimentary canal was not unfounded. The chick that died, at an age of
thirteen days, on post mortem was found to have its proventriculus impacted
with vegetable material.
Black Swans Cygnus atratus reared cygnets in 1987 and 1988 but in the
latter year the male became increasingly aggressive to the public and the pair
were replaced by a young pair of Black-necked Swans Cygnus melanocory-
phus. Also new to the collection in 1988 was a group of Baikal Teal Anas for-
mosa. Hawaiian Geese Branta sandvicensis, Red-breasted Geese Branta rufi-
collis, Emperor Geese Anser canagicus and Ruddy-headed Geese Chloephaga
rubidiceps were reared, as was a single Cereopsis Goose Cereopsis novaehol-
landiae.
Ducks bred included White-faced and Fulvous Tree Ducks Dendrocygna
viduata, D. bicolor, Laysan, Ringed and Marbled Teal Anas platyrhynchos
laysanensis, Calonetta leucophrys, Marmaronetta angustirostris; Chiloe
Wigeon A. sibilatrix, Shoveler A. clypeata. Common Shelduck Tadorna tador-
na. Tufted Duck Aythya fuligula\ Rosy-billed and Red-crested Pochard Netta
peposaca, N. rufina; Mandarin and Carolina Wood Ducks Aix galericulata, A.
sponsa.
We were especially pleased to have our first breedings of White-winged
Wood Ducks Cainna scutulata. Ruddy Ducks Oxyura jamaicensis and
Hooded Mergansers Mergus cucullatus. Normally held in a separate side-pen
one of the White-winged Wood Ducks repeatedly escaped from this pen into

the main waterfowl lake in 1988. After a series of deaths of adult Hooded
Mergansers the culprit was finally found to be this White-winged Wood Duck.
It was caught in the act of attempting to drown a Ruddy Duck that had just
hatched off a clutch of youngsters. Endangered but dangerous to other ducks,
we were nonetheless extremely pleased to rear four young White-winged
Wood Duck from the parents entrusted to us by the Wildfowl Trust.
Three Andean Condors Vultur gryphus were hand-reared in 1987. After
having hand-reared six Condors over the previous three years we decided in
1988 to leave the first egg with the parents. This was duly incubated but did
not hatch and the parents did not lay again. In 1989 we removed the two eggs
laid, only the first of which was fertile. The chick hatched from this egg was
puppet-reared, puppet models of both mother and father Condor being pro-
duced by our Education Department. Young from our breeding pair of
Condors are now held at the Falconry Centre (Newent), Colwyn Bay Zoo and
Chessington Zoo as well as at Antwerp and Rotterdam Zoos. It is hoped that
number seven will be flown to Moscow in 1990.
Sclaters Crested Curassow Crax fasciolata sclateri, a subspecies of the
Bare-faced Curassow was first bred at Chester over 20 years ago. After some
years with little further success in breeding from these Curassows we finally
succeeded in hatching chicks in 1988. Eight chicks were hatched of which six
were reared; all six were males, one was retained at Chester and others sent to
Rotterdam Zoo and Keith Howman. In 1989 a further four chicks were reared.
This time they proved to be two pairs and all four birds are now at Paignton
Zoo. Variable Chachalacas Ortalis motmot also bred at Chester, one chick
being hand-reared in 1988 and another parent-reared in 1989.
Pheasants reared over the three year period included White Eared
Pheasants Crossoptilon crossoptilon, Grey Peacock Pheasants Polyplectron
bicalcaratum , Palawan Peacock Pheasants P. emphanum, Himalayan Monals
Lophophorus impeyanus and Golden Pheasants Chrysolophus pictus. New
arrivals over the same period included pairs of Congo Peafowl Afropavo con-
gensis on loan from Antwerp Zoo, Edwards' Pheasants Lophura edwardsi
from Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust and Lady Amherst's Pheasants
Chrysolophus amherstiae from Rode. Of all our Pheasant species the Congo
Peafowl is the one we most wish to rear. We have had a series of clutches from
the Congo Peafowl but all except one have been infertile and these failed to
hatch.
A pair of White-naped Cranes Grus vipio were received from Rotterdam in
1988. The male, a hand-reared bird originally from Walsrode, is extremely
aggressive to keepers and greatly enjoys chasing them before returning to his
shy partner and displaying proudly with loud trumpeting calls. More recently
we have brought together four pairs of Black Crowned Cranes Balearica
paxonina pavonina. Four of these birds are on deposit from Barcelona Zoo

and others have been loaned by Paradise Park at Hayle and Joe Blossom. In
co-operation with the Tropical Bird Gardens, Rode, who have had previous
success with this species, we are presently trying to sort out compatible pair-
ings from our joint holdings. The Black Crowned Crane, although not present-
ly a "listed" species, is becoming increasingly scarce in many parts of its West
African range. Once breeding regularly in Nigeria, and that country's national
bird, it is unlikely that any now breed within the country's borders. Sarus
Cranes Grus anti gone which we bred for the first time in 1986, were reared by
bantams in each of the last three years. After deaths of chicks left with the par-
ents in 1987 and 1988 we were delighted when they finally succeeded in rear-
ing a chick in 1989. That chick, hatched from the second clutch some three
weeks later than the one fostered by the bantam, soon outgrew its bantam-
reared sibling and proved to be a most magnificent youngster.
Crowned Plovers Vanellus coronatus and Blacksmith's Plovers V. armatus
were also bred. The parent-reared Crowned Plovers grew faster than their
hand-reared counterparts. Perhaps this resulted from our deliberately limiting
the amount of protein fed to the hand-reared birds whilst we had less control
of the diet of the parent-reared youngsters. Past problems with leg deformities
have often been put down to too rapid growth resulting from excess protein
and so we carefully control the diets of hand-reared birds. That these problems
in leg growth occur less in parent-reared birds, even though these grow faster,
may be related to the extra exercise the latter get in their more natural environ-
ment. While bantams so often prove good fosters, they also have their prob-
lems. The only Little Black Bustard Afrotis atra which was hatched in 1988
was fatally attacked by its bantam foster parent soon after hatching.
A very exciting breakthrough was our first hatching of a Pink Pigeon
Nesoenas [columba] mayeri in 1988. The Pink Pigeon chick was hatched by
domestic pigeon fosters but died at about ten days old. Sadly although eggs
were laid by the Pink Pigeons in 1989 few were fertile and none was hatched.
Mountain Witch Doves Geotrygon versicolor , Bar-tailed Cuckoo Doves
Macropygia unchall , Crested Pigeons Ocyphaps lophotes and Laughing Doves
Streptopelia senegalensis were bred and recent arrivals include three species
of Gallicolumba\ Golden Heart Doves Gallicolumba rufigula, Luzon Bleeding
Hearts G. luzonica and Celebes Quail Doves G. tristigmata. The Luzon
Bleeding Hearts proved on surgical sexing to be three females. One was sent
on breeding loan to Paignton Zoo from which in 1989 two chicks were reared;
you guessed it, these were both females! Celebes Quail Doves have settled
well in the free-flight of our Tropical House but have recently become aggres-
sive to each other and dominant over the smaller Mountain Witch Doves. A
pair of Celebes Quail Doves nested in December 1989 but the single egg was
balanced precariously on a flimsy nest of a few leaves and soon became a vic-
tim of the law of gravity. Other recent arrivals include Emerald Doves

Chalcophaps indica from Paignton Zoo and Common Bronzewing Pigeons
Phaps chalcoptera from the Tropical Bird Gardens at Rode.
Lories and Lorikeets presently held in the collection include Duyvenbode's
Lory Chalcopsitta duivenbodei , Yellow-backed Chattering Lory Lorius garru-
lus flavopalliatus. Musk Lorikeet Glossopsitta concinna, and
Musschenbroek's Lorikeet Neopsittacus musschenbroekii. Yellow-backed
Chattering Lories hatched but failed to rear chicks in 1989.
Musk Lorikeets have proved willing nesters but difficult to rear successful-
ly. Since 1987 our breeding pair has nested two or three times each year but
only four chicks have fledged. One of these bred in 1988 was parent-reared to
fledging then removed from the aviary because of aggression from its parents
which clearly wanted to re-nest. This bird was caged and quickly became
independent but then died several weeks later after being placed in an outside
aviary. Post mortem indicated ascites and hepatic failure as the cause of death.
A second young which fledged in 1989 died as a result of an enteritic infection
through Escherichia coli. Accordingly when the next two youngsters fledged
they were immediately removed from the parents' aviary and transferred to a
box cage where they could be closely monitored.
The same thing happened with Musschenbroek's Lorikeets which reared
two chicks in 1989 only to attack these shortly after fledging. Again these
youngsters were quickly removed to the safety of a box cage. Goldie's
Lorikeets Trichoglossus goldiei were bred in 1987 but were then moved out of
the collection in order to create space for Papuan Lorikeets Charmosyna
papou , a female of which is on loan to us from Mr Raymond Sawyer.
Comparisons of our birds with specimens from the British Museum suggest
that they are of the subspecies C. p. goliathina rather than C. p. stellae as com-
monly assumed.
New Psittacine arrivals include a pair of Thick-billed Parrots
Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha , one from Ken Dolton and the other from Jersey
Zoo; a pair of Blue and Yellow Macaws Ara ararauna which bred in their first
year at Chester and again in 1989; and most recently two captive-bred Green-
cheeked Amazons Amazona viridigenalis. Lesser Vasa Parrots Coracopsis
nigra have bred in each of the last three years but success with the Greater
Vasas Coracopsis vasa has consistently eluded us. Our female lays infertile
eggs annually outside the nest box in which she otherwise spends the greater
part of her time. Compatibility appears to be a problem and so we have recent-
ly purchased a second pair of Greater Vasas. Once they have settled it is our
intention to house all four birds together and allow them to select their own
mates. Other parrots bred in the collection were Derbyan Parakeets Psittacula
derbiana, Barraband Parakeets (Superb Parrots) Polytelis swainsonii. Red-
masked Conures Aratinga erythrogenys, Lesser Patagonian Conures
Cyanoliseus patagonus and Yellow-faced Parrotlets Forpus xanthops.

In aviculture things are often not what they first seem. This was certainly
the case with our Palm Cockatoos Probosciger aterrimus which for several
years we had considered to be two large males and a small female. What we in
fact had were two males of the large subspecies P. a. goliath , and one of the
smaller P. a. aterrimus. Now after a number of exchanges and the transfer of
one of our males on breeding loan we hold a pair of the smaller subspecies.
Similar problems occurred with Red-fronted Macaws Ara rubrogenys, of
which a number placed with us by Customs &amp; Excise were all surgically sexed
as females. Jersey Zoo kindly loaned us a surgically sexed male. We were
really pleased when after several years with no breeding attempts, the Jersey
bird and its mate produced a clutch of two eggs in 1988. However, we could
not understand why only the Jersey bird was seen to incubate the eggs, this
seemed unusual for a male. The eggs were infertile and at the end of the
breeding season our worst suspicions were confirmed when the Jersey bird
was resexed and found to be a female. After a series of exchanges brought
about by reciprocal breeding loans, we now hold two sexed pairs of Red-front-
ed Macaws at Chester.
A recurrent problem in keeping Touracos at Chester has been that of infec-
tion by Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, especially presenting a problem during
the winter months in our arcade aviaries. In our experience White-cheeked
Touracos Tauraco leucotis have proved less susceptible than other species and
it is therefore not surprising that this has been the first species of touraco bred
at Chester, one chick being reared by its parents in 1989. Both birds behaved
amicably until the chick was three weeks old when the male had to be
removed because of aggression towards its mate. This created the opportunity
to split two sibling pairs. Whereas one of the newly formed pairs now seems
settled, the other two birds, which were introduced together some six months
ago, still persistently avoid each other.
Two pairs of Barn Owls Tyto alba reared a total of fifty-six chicks over the
last three years. In conjunction with a local release programme, co-ordinated
by Dr Carol Hackney and given a Royal Society for Nature Conservation
award in 1986, these were released at carefully chosen sites in North West
England. Monitoring at these release sites has indicated recent Bam Owl
breeding suggesting at least some success in this project, and one of our Owls
is now breeding on the Wirral, where the only three breeding pairs all resulted
from captive-breeding and release projects.
Other Owls bred include Spectacled Owl Pulsatrix perspicillata. Great
Homed Owl Bubo virginianus , Great Eagle Owls Bubo bubo and Snowy Owls
Nyctea scandiaca. Our female Vermiculated Fishing Owl Scotopelia bouvieri,
which arrived at Chester in 1969, has remained unpaired since that date.
Considering that she was then too old to breed and having been unable to find
her a mate of her own species, she shared her aviary with an elderly

Spectacled Owl in 1989 and surprised us all by laying two eggs!
White-faced Scops Owls Otus leucotis have been a particular favourite of
mine since one lived under my bookcase in Kano, Nigeria. That particular owl
had been saved from the stoning of local boys who believed owls to be evil. I
was thus more than delighted when in November 1989 two of these beautiful
little owls came to Chester on deposit from London Zoo.
Kookaburras Dacelo novaeguineae have continued to breed well, rearing
chicks annually. White Woodpeckers Leuconerpes candidus on deposit at
Chester from Rotterdam Zoo reared three chicks in 1987 and five chicks in
two broods in 1988. The two youngsters from the first brood were tolerated by
the parents during their second nesting cycle, and indeed assisted in feeding
the three second-brood chicks. These appear to be the only recorded breedings
of this Woodpecker in the UK in the fifty years since Alfred Ezra was awarded
an Avicultural Society medal for the first captive breeding.
Crimson-rumped Toucanets Aulacorhynchus haematopygus reared three
chicks in 1987. In 1988 four chicks were hatched but did not survive follow-
ing the death of the female parent after aggression by the male. We have since
been unable to find a partner for our male. Collared Aracari Pteroglossus
torquatus , new to the collection in 1988, had two clutches of eggs in 1989 but
all were infertile. Aggression from the male towards the female subsequent to
these failed nesting attempts has prevented us getting these birds together
again. Channel-billed Toucans Ramphastos vitellinus reared two chicks in
1989. Details of this breeding and of the rearing of African Grey Hombills
Tockus nasutus in 1988 and 1989, and Trumpeter Hombills Bycanistes buci-
nator in 1989 are being prepared separately for this journal. Recent additions
to the collection from the Coraciiformes include Rhinoceros Hombills
Buceros rhinoceros and European Rollers Coracias garrulus.
Passerines bred in the Bird House and adjacent arcade aviaries included
White-crested Laughing Thrush Garrulax leucolophus. Red-tailed Laughing
Thrush Garrulax milnei, Coleto Mynah Sarcops calvus, Superb Spreo
Starlings Spreo superbus, San Bias Jay Cissilopha sanblasiana and Azure-
winged Magpies Cyanopica cyana. Following a series of unsuccessful breed-
ing attempts in 1988 three Azure-winged Magpie nestlings were removed
when half-feathered to be finished off by hand-rearing. Since then reciprocal
breeding loans between Chester and the Tropical Bird Gardens, Rode have
resulted in second-generation breedings at both Zoos. We were particularly
satisfied that our hand-reared female proved a model parent to her first brood
in 1989 and that her parents also reared their own chicks that year.
The strategy of removing Rothschild's Mynahs Leucopsar rothschildi at
about five days old for hand-rearing was adopted in 1987. One chick was
hand-reared in 1987, two in 1988 and three in 1989. Blue-winged Pittas Pitta
brachyura, Plumbeous Redstarts Rhyacornis fuliginosus and Royal Starlings

Cosmopsarus regius were presented to the Zoo by Customs &amp; Excise in 1988,
and are exhibited in the upper aviaries of the Tropical House. A pair of Fire-
fronted Bishops Euplectes diadematus were purchased in 1988 as "out of
colour" Napoleon Weavers E. afer. Robin Restall (1975) notes that this is a
species he had never seen so we must indeed consider it scarce in aviculture.
Birds bred in the aviaries or the free flight of the Tropical House included
Roulroul Partridge Rollulus roulroul , Californian Quail Lophortyx californica ,
Red-backed Mousebird Colius castanotus, Orange-headed Ground Thrush
Zoothera citrina, Pekin Robin Leiothrix lutea, Silver-eared Mesia L. argen-
tauris , Blue-grey Tanager Thraupis episcopus , Red-eared Bulbul Pycnonotus
jocosus. Red-cowled Cardinal Paroaria dominicana, Fairy Bluebird Irena
puella, Java Sparrow Padda oryzivora, Long-tailed Glossy Starling
Lamprotornis caudatus and Purple Glossy Starling L. purpureus.
More notable was the rearing of Ashy Starlings Cosmopsarus unicolor , we
believe for the first time in the UK, as also may be the breedings of White-
headed Buffalo Weavers Dinemellia dinemelli and Golden Palm Weaver
Ploceus bojeri. Both the Weaver species nested in the free-flight of the
Tropical House constructing their nests in the large Palm Trees. The White-
headed Buffalo Weavers built a large communal structure in the crown of one
of the Palm Trees. This appeared to be a single entity with three separate nest
holes and was built mainly of dry strips of vegetation. Following the breeding
attempt from which one chick successfully fledged a portion of the nest fell
down. On inspection this resembled a hollow ball of hay, of perhaps 20 cm
diameter. Clearly the larger nest was constructed from a number of these units.
This contrasted with the more substantial structure built of larger twigs by the
Red-billed Buffalo Weavers Bubalornis albirostris niger. The Golden Palm
Weavers suspended their nests from the fronds of Palm Trees usually above
water areas. At least three broods fledged in 1989 and after each one, that nest
was then destroyed by the Weavers.
First breedings are fun and serve to extend our avicultural knowledge and
experience, especially where they involve families or genera not previously
bred in captivity. However, our priorities should be to establish captive stocks
of those species endangered in the wild. A recent report published by the
International Council for Bird Preservation suggested that over a thousand
species of birds are threatened in the wild and very few of these can be consid-
ered as established in aviculture. At Chester Zoo we face many challenges
with the husbandry of endangered species recently entrusted to our care and in
co-operation with other zoos and private aviculturists hope that we can help in
furthering the cause of captive breeding for conservation in the 1990's.

Serinus mennelli
by F. C. BARNICOAT
(Johannesburg, South Africa)
The Black-eared Seedeater has never figured in aviculture outside of
Zimbabwe or South Africa. I have never seen reference to it in any book on
aviculture except Robin Restall's excellent work Finches and other Seed-eat-
ing Birds. His description and facts given for the Mennell's Seedeater are
accurate, but they are given under the heading "Brown-rumped Seedeater
Serinus tristriatus (p 108) and this is an entirely different, not a synonymous
species, which comes from north-eastern Africa. Mr Restall, too, states that he
has no avicultural reference for the Mennell&amp;apos;s. As I did at least keep the
Mennell's Seedeater for some years, I feel that an article on it may be of some
interest in the Avicultural Magazine.
Like its obviously very close relative the Streaky-headed Seedeater, which
is a common and widely distributed species in Africa south of the Sahara and
is widely kept in captivity in Southern Africa anyway, the infinitely rarer
Mennell's is a quietly coloured bird, attractively marked in shades of grey and
white. Both have the characteristic whitish head attractively streaked with
black markings, but the Mennell's has a wider, more striking white eye-brow,
and the impressive black cheek patch. I might here warn that the plates in I
Mackworth-Praed and Grant also depict black cheek patches on the Streaky-
headed Seedeater, but this is not the case and apt to be misleading. The con-
trasts in white, grey and black on the Mennell's are far more striking than the
more muted grey tones of the Streaky-headed Seedeater. I am hoping it may t
be possible to print a photograph of these birds, because even black and white !
photography readily gives an exact impression of what they look like. An
excellent coloured plate of the Mennell&amp;apos;s Seedeater by D. M. Henry was pub-
lished in Skead&amp;apos;s 'The Canaries, Seedeaters and Buntings of Southern Africa.
The relatively close resemblance of the Streaky-headed and the Mennell's
Seedeater, coupled with the fact that in Zimbabwe they are sometimes found
in the same area, has occasionally given rise to confusion, and I came across a
fancier in Zimbabwe who was keeping a Black-eared and a Streaky-headed
Seedeater, both males, in an aviary, as he was under the impression that the
latter was a female of the former. A statement in most of the editions of f
Roberts' Birds of South Africa, that the females "have brown cheek patches" j
has also led to much confusion. They certainly do not have brown cheek
patches and in fact sexual dimorphism is not strong in them, the females being
slightly smaller on average and with the streaks on the head and the sides of
l
the face a duller black. Her plumage is generally somewhat paler than the

male's, but there is no specific difference.
The Black-eared Seedeater was not recorded until 1908 when specimens
were shot by E.C. Chubb at Tjoko's Kraal, Shangani River, Southern
Rhodesia. A specimen was sent to the British Museum and Dr Bowdler Sharpe
suggested that it be named after F.R Mennell, a well-known Consulting
Geologist and Mining Engineer of Bulawayo, who had defrayed the expenses
of the expedition undertaken by Mr Chubb, and who had collected many birds
for the Rhodesian Museum.
The Black-eared Seedeater is almost purely a Zimbabwean species spilling
over slightly into Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia and Zaire, but not south-
wards across the Limpopo River into South Africa. Though its distribution is
quite extensive, it is very patchy. It may be quite common in very restricted
areas, yet disappear from them in another season. It appears to be a bird of the
arid thombush country and Belcher said that it was found on wooded, rocky
hillsides never below 3,000 feet. Unlike the Streaky-headed Seedeater it
appears to shun cultivated ground and be found in the wilder areas.
Mackworth-Praed and Grant state that in the breeding season the males
have a courtship flight consisting of an upward flight to some considerable
height and then a series of swerving dives interspersed with butterfly-like
flaps, and that the song is always given from the top boughs of tall trees. It has
been suggested to me that they might, therefore, be very difficult if not impos-
sible to breed in captivity. My experience of keeping them, however, would
indicate that they adapt very readily to life in an aviary, and I feel certain that
if pairs could be obtained and given reasonable accommodation they would
breed well.
In April 1981 I was sent two Black-eared Seedeaters by a fancier in
Zimbabwe, and during a holiday there in July 1987 I obtained more from
someone else. As luck would have it, all five were males. They lived happily
and peaceably in my aviaries for several years. Unfortunately it proved impos-
sible to obtain a female, so I acquired two Streaky-headed Seedeater hens, but
I could never get even one of the Black-eared males to show the slightest
interest in either of them. When keeping the two species together in aviaries,
despite their similarities in appearance, subtle differences in their habits
became apparent. Their flight patterns were different, and the Black-eared pre-
ferred more open perching. One of the difficulties of keeping the Black-eared
was that they had a rooted objection to using my aviary shelters. They thrived
on the usual dry seeds, green foods, of which they were particularly fond, and
soaked sunflower seed. With the passing of time they became quite tame, and
at times the cocks came into obviously high breeding condition and uttered a
pleasant song. The last surviving one escaped when I accidentally failed to
fasten an aviary door in 1988, by which time he had lived in my aviaries for
over six years.

In the 1950s, 60s and 70s the keeping of wild birds was in a thriving state
in Rhodesia, and though these birds have never been readily obtainable by the
aviculturist, I have absolutely no doubt that some of the many Rhodesian
fanciers must have kept and even bred the Mennell's Seedeater. Most of these
breedings would have gone unrecorded, but it is possible that a success might
have been listed amongst others by the few Rhodesian fanciers who wrote in
publications like Foreign Birds.
Very few Mennell's Seedeaters have ever been brought south of the border
to the Republic of South Africa. However Neville Brickell observed a breed-
ing of the Black-eared Seedeater in a Durban fancier's aviary in January 1966.
The nest was cup-shaped, built of coir and plant matter, and placed in the fork
of a mulberry tree 8ft from the ground. The incubation period was 13 days and
three young ones left the nest at 18 days old. Neville Brickell himself had pre-
viously bred a hybrid from a Streaky-headed male and a Black-eared female,
which he had obtained from a canary breeder who had tried to breed mules
from it in 1963 and 1964 unsuccessfully. It was placed in an aviary with two
male and one female Streaky-headed Seedeaters, and in 1965 it laid a clutch of
three eggs of which two were clear. The other egg hatched and the young
hybrid was successfully raised, (pers. comm.).

The advent of the guerilla war in Rhodesia seriously curtailed avicultural
pursuits, and subsequently many of the prominent bird keepers emigrated. At
present the chances of ever acquiring the Black-eared Seedeater again seem
remote, but it would be nice to think that in due course aviculture in
Zimbabwe might get back to its former standard, and that this totally delight-
ful aviary bird might again be kept and bred in captivity.

"If God had created a paradise specially for birds, then it would surely
have been Brazil: the number of species found there is so great, the beauty of
their plumage and song is such, their joy in simply being and in peopling the
fields and forests of this immense land is so obvious that it is difficult to imag-
ine anywhere else on earth which would be more welcoming to birds in all
their needs.&amp;quot;
Augusto Ruschi, 1984, Aves do Brasil , volume 2
No one who has seen some of Brazil's parrots in field or aviary would be
apt to argue with the above by Augusto Ruschi. Examples well known to read-
ers would include the magnificent Hyacinthine Macaw Anodorhynchus
hyacinthinus, a species that was once common but which is now endangered -
perhaps even on the brink. To see it disappear altogether from the wild would
be a tremendous loss. So too, would be the extirpation of the Golden or Queen
of Bavaria's Conure Aratinga guarouba , whose bright yellow plumage with
green remiges, morphology and intelligence (something that could even be
described as "presence"), give it no equal in the avian world. Indeed, it is so
distinct from other parrots that it has no close relatives or geographic variants.
This taxonomic isolation strongly suggests that it deserves being placed in its
own genus. Resurrecting Lesson's Guarouba would be the most logical solu-
tion, for even its Portuguese name of Ararajuba (Arara = macaw, juba = yel-
low) denotes that it is not a typical conure. To lose this spectacular jewel
would be a very great loss but, alas, this may be its destiny.
The Ararajuba is presently restricted to north-eastern Brazil, south of the
Amazon River, from the west bank of the Rio Tapajos, Para, east to north-
western Maranhao. There are reports that it once extended farther east, possi-
bly even to Ceara, yet this seems unlikely and currently impossible. To the
east of the known range, there is the "Zona Bragantina". This area lies 300 km
east of Belem, the capital of the state of Para, where the mighty Amazon
meets the Atlantic ocean, and is known for having been totally cleared of its
original growth - a nadir comprising 30,000 sq. km., where few parrots sur-
vive.
The Bragantina was colonised over 100 years ago by immigrants from the
drought-scorn and dirt-poor cow country of the Brazilian north-east as well as
Spain, Portugal, France and the Azores. For a few years, all prospered and a
railroad was built, but then crops of rice, com and cassava failed. Virtually all
colonists drifted away, the railroad closed and the Arcadia of the neotropics

was left as a desolate spot on the map. (Stone, 1985, Dreams of Amazonia,
New York: Viking Penguin) One would think that the Bragantina taught a seri-
ous lesson to man, but it did not and schemes which dwarf it are now in
progress; these will fragment the remaining habitat of guarouba severely and
could ostensibly seal its fate in doom.
This eastern part of the range is under the greatest of pressure. The Gurupi
area where Paul Roth observed several specimens in 1983 is one such exam-
ple. It is in the midst of colonisation from eastern Maranhao and Para, and an
area 1.6 million ha. decreed in 1961 as a national park (but never implement-
ed) has now largely been colonized by cattle ranches and timber companies.
Information such as this was undoubtedly used by David Oren and Fernando
Novaes (1986, Biological Conservation, 36:329-337) when they wrote that the
Golden Conure will "be extinct in Maranhao by 1990 and the rest of the
region east of the Tocantins by [the year] 2000".
The western part of the range offers more hope, particularly an area in
which guarouba was recently found and from which it was unknown. Authors
have consistently given the western limit as the Xingu River, Para, until
Oliveiro M. de Oliveira Pinto published his Novo Catdlogo das Aves do Brasil
in 1978. In it he extended the range to the Tapajos River, this information
being based on a specimen obtained by Alfonso Olalla at Fordlandia in 1962.
Previous failures of collectors to obtain specimens in this area are explained
by their habit for many years of remaining on the more passable rivers and not
venturing upland. The Trans-Amazon Highway, which now extends from
Belem south-west into Cruzerio do Sul, almost near Peru, has made records in
the new locality possible. Oren and Willis (1981, Auk, 98:394-396) recorded
groups near Itaituba, on the west bank of the Tapajos, and as far away as
between this locality and Altamira.
The western limit falls within the 1 million ha. Tapajos National Park, the
only such reserve in Para state. However, this area would not be sacrosanct if
minerals were found, and already squatters have commenced clearing the land.
Plans initially called for 250 individuals to staff the headquarters planned for
an area overlooking the forest and river, but when I was last in Brazil (1987),
an individual employed by the superintendency of the Amazon (SUDAM) told
me that there were only a half dozen workers and that patrolling had not yet
commenced. He added, however, that a hilltop had been flattened so that the
planned building could someday be constructed.
Pressures on the species occur even near the central section of the range.
Consider Tucuruf, a town on the left bank of the Tocantins River. Between 7-
19 June 1980, Oren (in Oren and Willis, loc. cit.) sighted groups of seven to
twelve daily and on the 20th a band of 27 flew over Tucuruf, but this same
area would soon be lost as a feeding and nesting site for it was to be the site of
a massive hydroelectric project, part of the Grande Carajas scheme.

W. R. Kingston provided me with details of the damage this project is like-
ly to cause. Starting in October 1984, flooding commenced and inundated an
area of 2400 sq.km, save for some 600 islands. These islands, ranging from a
couple to several hundred square kilometers in size, were expected to alleviate
the pressures put on the wildlife but most will do no such thing. Kingston
explained (in litt., 1985): "Some birds will no doubt have reached the perma-
nent islands and have some chance of survival, but one cannot help feeling
that the larger predators of the area are the most likely to have done so and
will rapidly decimate the prey species, each other and finally die of starva-
tion.&amp;quot;
Had the individuals who planned Tucurui Dam been made aware of the
Minimal Critical Size project being conducted deep in the Brazilian Amazon
north of Manaus, they may have realised the minimal value of these islands.
For there to be a complete biota intact, an area needs to be 250,000 hectares in
extent - as the size decreases, so too does the number of birds, mammals, etc.
present.
Birds displaced outside the flooded area may not fare any better. The
Amazon has been described by many as containing endless riches, with the
trees teeming with primates and birds and a forest so thick as to be impenetra-
ble. This is mere fiction: when one travels to the area, the first thing that is
evident is the fragility of the soil and the absence of wildlife, which can be
seen only if one has extensive experience in the field. Here the equilibrium
can be upset very easily and this is the expected outcome when birds from a
disturbed area move into a pristine one. Chances are that the sector contains
the appropriate numbers of birds it could support, both in terms of tood and
nesting size. Increase this number, and disarray will prevail.
The Golden Conure typically occupies tierra firme forest, recognised by
the fact that it never floods and is on high ground. The only record of
Ararajuba occurring in varzea or flooded forest dates back some years to a
location near Tucurui. The parrots avoid deforested or cleared areas except
when nesting; they then venture into the open, selecting a living or dead tree in
which to nest. One or more pairs will use the same site; up to seven chicks can
be found simultaneously, these the production of at least two but possibly
three hens (infertile eggs are also usually present). Each group, which includes
the breeding pairs and possibly their young from the previous year, will rear
the young together. If the nestlings are removed, it is customary for replace-
ment clutches to be produced.
Once the chicks fledge, the birds return to continuous forest. Only in mini-
mally disturbed areas will they remain near the nest the entire year, and then it
is used for sleeping.
This peculiar nesting habit, known for many years by inhabitants of the
area it occupies or trappers who collect young, was only recently discovered

by ornithologists. It may extend the chances of the species' survival, but only
slightly because it must have mature forest into which it can retreat.
Apart from the very serious threat of habitat destruction, this species also
suffers from persecution for food and for the clandestine bird trade. Although
it has been many years since the Golden Conure has been exported legally
from Brazil, it has not stopped flowing out; all end up in Europe or, less fre-
quently, Asia. Some are sold in southern Brazil. It is difficult to say precisely
how many young are removed from the nest or adults trapped, but it would be
conservative to say that it numbers a hundred.
One reason why it is so popular is its beauty and intelligence. W. T.
Greene, who in the late 1800s produced a three-volume series titled Parrots in
Captivity stated that among parrots there is "perhaps no more striking looking
creature" than the Golden Conure. Its beauty is, in my eyes, highlighted by its
size: it is the largest Aratinga conure. But amongst parrots it is perhaps the
most intelligent and this fact has been pointed out by virtually every avicultur-
al writer. Tame birds will allow handling without complaining; they appear to
thrive by giving their owners affection, by sitting against one's chest for long
periods while being petted, by quietly sitting on the hand looking at one, or by
gently nibbling on the finger and then looking at the face for a reaction.
If widely available, these gems would be in great demand for pets. Few
parrots could equal Ararajuba in this respect, but then given the small gene
pool in captivity and its endangered status, all young must enter breeding col-
lections. In doing so, its future is secured.
If the Golden Conure has two faults, it is its habit of feather plucking or
mutilating and its voice: a piercing shriek that could easily stand every hair on
one's head! However the Moluccan Cockatoo Cacatua moluccensis,
Hyacinthine Macaw Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus, and Double Yellow-headed
Amazon Amazona ochrocephala oratrix are all equally endowed with strong
voices and this has not reduced their popularity. The voice comes with these
birds, and if one is interested in keeping or breeding them, this must be accept-
ed. Plucking is another story.
Feather plucking is almost synonymous with the Golden Conure, with the
vast majority of individuals falling victim to this vice. Over the years, I have
noticed that this problem is as common in young as it is in adults; the former,
being highly inquisitive, often chew at the flight and tail feathers of their sib-
lings to occupy their time. It also seems that feathers are despoiled more com-
monly in spring and summer, and less so during and after the moult.
No one has been able to define the causes that induce plucking, but two
factors appear to play roles: boredom and a deficiency, perhaps of animal pro-
tein or some mineral. Those individuals which are most familiar with
Ararajuba in the field have never observed specimens with obvious feather
problems (e.g., bare areas or badly chewed flight or tail feathers, the most easy

to observe under field conditions, though in all fairness, one must point out
that any bird with major plumage faults would probably become easy prey).
This is due to the constant activity: the birds never feel bored due to the count-
less leaves and branches that are available to chew, naturally occurring holes
that can be inspected, and presence of others of their kind for mutual preening
and playing.
Golden Conures, as has been previously stated, are highly family or group
oriented. Most aviculturists lack the means of being able to keep more than
one pair, hence the birds forego the benefits of being held in groups. One suc-
cessful Latin breeder has kept and bred his in a small colony, and to my
knowledge, there has never been any serious feather problems.
Keeping a pair or even a singleton invariably occupied appears very impor-
tant. These intelligent birds enjoy playing with toys, swings, bells, and the
like, more than most parrots; these should be offered continously, but they
should be changed regularly or the birds suffer from monotony. In cases where
these are available and plucking still occurs, then the diet should be analysed.
A friend who kept his pair at liberty in the house and provided them with
countless things with which to stay amused had one bird denude itself in every
area it could reach. It then started on its mate, removing first the flight and tail
feathers. When the problem was reported to me, I suggested increasing the
amount of fruits and vegetables, reducing oily seeds and offering fish or
cooked meat or poultry several times weekly. These seeds, incidentally, were
found by Ron Hastings to cause feather plucking in cockatoos. Once they were
replaced with greens, fruits, vegetables and sprouted seeds, the problem
ceased altogether. The aforementioned pair of Golden Conures soon ceased
plucking and feathered out. They have yet to despoil another feather.
I have seen many parrots in their habitat, and have several times recorded
them eating animal protein. My feeling is that the Golden Conures would
probably take insects, snails or lizards in their natural conditions. If these were
provided, along with a mineral lick containing salt and various trace elements,
any deficiencies might be overcome. Some years ago salt was considered
taboo, but field work is showing that parrots from macaws to cockatiels,
actively seek this in the wild. Providing it in limited quantities is, therefore,
natural.
Birds afflicted with feather plucking may be undesirable as pets, but they
need not be wasted - these can make perfect breeders; and captive breeding
can only help to keep the Golden Conure extant. The first to breed this avian
gem was Dr. W. C. Osman Hill of Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon). A pair
obtained in 1936 nested at the end of 1938, and fledged two young in May
1939. Also that year, G. T. Turner produced young in Britain - the first suc-
cess for that country. Several other English aviculturists have since bred this
species, but none has achieved the success of Jim and Pearl Hayward of

Oxfordshire. The foundation stock was in single figures but twelve years later,
their goal of 50 was established, including third generation young; and the fab-
ulous number of 24 was bred in 1983.
In the US, Mrs Oliver Gilmer was the forerunner of a number of breeders,
the most successful of which has been Busch Gardens in Tampa. Under the
direction of Ed Bish, the species has bred there regularly for many years.
When Richard Naegeli was Curator of Birds there in the late 1960s, the
Golden Conure was bred on the colony system (Dave West, in lift.). Colony
breeding has been used with great success by R J. E. Beraut of Brazil.
Many Golden Conure hens willingly lay in captivity and prove as prolific
as Sun Conures Aratinga s. solstitialis. As an example, a hen belonging to the
West German aviculturist and author Thomas Arndt produced 100 eggs in an
eight year period. Unfortunately, these were infertile due to the absence of a
mate. In 1982, he finally reared young.
My own experience at breeding this species is limited to a three-year old,
captive-bred pair obtained last year. They were placed in a cage approximately
1.2 m. (4 ft) long, with an attached nest 25 cm (10 in) square and 60 cm (24
in) deep, lined with several pieces of soft, rotted wood. The initially tame
birds started showing aggression in the middle of last year: they would erect
feathers, move from side to side and suddenly lunge forward, sometimes
charging at my hand. During mating, which became a regular occurrence, the
female would crouch. The male placed a foot on her back, then tails crossed.
During this act, the wings were quivered and accompanied by ineffable
sounds. Afterwards they both called loudly to the world.
Towards late August, t he hen started spending time in the nest. By then she
(sometimes in the company of the male) had chewed the available wood. The
first of four eggs appeared on September 18th, each of the next two every sec-
ond day with the last four days after the third. Approximately 28 days later -
exact information is unavailable as I was out of town for two weeks during
this time - the first of four young hatched. These were covered in white down
and were capable of producing a long squeak after about 24 hours. The down
soon abraded and the chicks remained naked until the first feathers appeared -
a character not found in other Aratingas, which get a secondary down, usually
dark in colour. Slightly over the third week, pin feathers appeared and the
chicks were completely feathered by the time they left the nest, at about ten
weeks. The last to hatch fledged at 12 weeks, presumably because the parents
paid less attention to it when newly hatched.
Pairs of conures usually prove perfect parents for about three weeks, when
they often lose interest in their young or become abusive. I have seen them
bite the young and know of cases where they have killed or maimed them.
This pair of Golden Conures proved ideal parents, tending to the young like
few other parrots: they invariably kept their progeny full of food - except for

the first few days in the life of the last, when they paid only slight attention to
it, feeding it after the first three had their fill. Their attention was so that it was
decided to allow them to fledge their progeny, rather than pull them as is cus-
tomary.
On emerging from the nest, all had soft, pink bulbous swellings to the base
of the upper mandible. Their plumage differed from each other; each had
largely yellow plumage with green streaking to the head and mantle, cheeks
and mantle, or just mantle. All had green quills to the tail feathers. Their
plumage was flawless, then one day the parents chewed the tip of the flight
and tail feathers. That day, when the eldest was just over 15 weeks old, all
were removed, fearing that they would be denuded by their ever attentive par-
ents.
Removing the chicks, as is often the case with conures, stimulated them
into nesting anew. The first egg was laid precisely nine weeks after the chicks
were removed. The entire clutch numbered three (all removed for artificial
incubation), but this did not thwart her interest in bringing forth more young
for she laid another set; two hatched and one is being reared at the time of
writing.
The beauty of the nestling guarouba, along with all the aforementioned
extolled qualities, make them irresistible; even I could not keep away from
their enclosure. But this will have to be resisted, for come three years' time,
these young must breed - and it is acts like this on the part of breeders of this
species that will keep Ararajuba extant, so that future generations will be able
to read reports such as Ruschi's and know that a special jewel has not been
lost forever.

(Rode Tropical Bird Gardens, Somerset)
These elegant and graceful birds are among my favourites. I first came to
know them back in the 1930s when they were quite frequently imported.
When the war came there was no further supply and after the war the chances
of seeing them again seemed pretty remote. A few years ago we were offered
some Royal Starlings. I hastened down to the dealer's premises and bought
four. These were wintered in a greenhouse aviary with a little artificial heat
with the idea of being able to put them in an outdoor aviary when the weather
improved. Due to negligence on my part one of them got out and was never
seen again. The remaining three birds spent several years with us. It became
obvious after a while that we had a cock and hen and a bird of unknown sex.
This particular bird eventually succumbed and we were left with a true pair.
Like most glossy starlings they are difficult to sex but if you look closely at
our pair the male has a heavier and slightly curved beak. The female had a thin
straight beak which reminded me more of a wagtail; apart from this slight dif-
ference there is no distinction between the sexes in the pattern or colour of the
plumage.
This year (1989) we have bred them for the first time at Rode. The first
summer they were kept in an outdoor aviary, with shelter attached, occupied
by various small finches and waxbills which they did not molest in any way.
There was in that year no attempt at nesting. The following summer they were
again put outdoors and did make an attempt to build a nest in the box provid-
ed, however nothing came of it. This happened during a hot spell and when
the weather turned cold, as it so often does in this country even in mid-sum-
mer, nesting operations ceased abruptly and that was that for the season
(1988).
This year, 1989, the long, hot, dry summer seemed to stimulate the birds to
do better than they had before. Within days of being put outdoors from their
winter quarters they started carrying nesting material consisting of moss and
pieces of hay and similar material into their nest box. After a week or two they
had laid three eggs from which three chicks hatched, one chick died early in
the nest leaving two which eventually fledged. One chick did not look as
strong as its nestmate and eventually died. We finished up with one chick
reared to maturity and the old cock bird. The old hen died soon after having
reared the chicks.
Now a few words about their care and maintenance. They are always win-
tered indoors in an unheated bird room and are put outside during a warm
spell in April or May. When I kept them in pre-war days I found they would

survive our winters quite easily without artificial heat but that was in
Middlesex. I think the climate was warmer there than we have down in north-
east Somerset. These birds are obviously happiest in warm, dry spells such as
the summer we have experienced. Another thing that we have noticed is that
they keep in much better condition on modem softbill diets than they did in
pre-war days where one had to make up the mixture - a concoction which had
to be moistened with water or milk. My memory of those pre-war starlings
was that they always dropped their wings and never seemed to be healthy. The
birds we are writing about now keep in excellent fettle and keep their wings
tight to the body which is a sign of good health. On one occasion, which I
have written about in our Magazine, I noticed these birds having a dust bath in
the peat which covered the floor of their enclosure. This was during the winter
when they were inside and the time of day was just before it got dark. It was a
very strange thing to see these birds dust bathing like sparrows, I have never
seen it since. We do not think that they indulge in bathing like most Passerine
birds but they did enjoy a summer shower when they would ruffle their feath-
ers whilst sitting out in the open flight.
The size of the aviary in which these bred is 14 feet by 12 feet by about 8
feet high (4.27 x 3.66 x 2.44m) with a wooden shelter attached. They use this
shelter quite a lot even at night and are very easily driven inside when one
wants to catch them. The aviary itself is planted and of course attracts a certain
amount of insect life. Our pair have never shown much interest in mealworms
but they do very much like the pupae, in fact they reared their young almost
entirely on these insects. We have also noticed they have a strong partiality for
ants and when these swarm in warm, still days during the summer they will fly
down and peck them up as fast as they can. They eat practically no fruit except
elderberries of which they are very fond; the trouble is that these are only in
season for a very short time so the rest of the year they do not eat fruit; we
have tried them with everything we know without success. To their softbill
mixture we add hard-boiled egg on one day and grated cheese on the other,
both of which ingredients are eaten freely.
The plumage of the chicks when they first leave the nest is very like that of
the parents although it is slightly duller and their tails are not so long. They
also have dark eyes which turn white as the birds get older. We also noticed
that when the chicks first fledged their beaks were much paler than those of
the adult with a pinkish shade but these pale areas quickly darkened until the
beak was black as in the parents. Great credit is due to the keepers who, during
the period when they were rearing young, assiduously fed them mealworm
pupae every two hours or so from dawn until dusk; but for this attention it is
doubtful if they would have reared any chicks. Like most softbills if you give
them live insects they will feed the chicks once and then stuff themselves with
what remains so that by the next feeding time there are no more live insects

for the young so they have to be rationed hourly throughout the day.
Incubation times and rearing times are given at the end of this article. The
nest was not a very elaborate affair being merely a collection of things like
moss and dead grass which formed a cup at the bottom of the nest box; this by
the way was a parrakeet box approximately 8 inches by 4 inches by 20 inches
deep (20.4 x 20.4 x 50.8cm) with the usual entrance hole in the side near the
top.
This breeding pair of birds occupied the aviary by themselves throughout
the rearing period. At the beginning when they were first put out there were
some Golden-breasted Buntings in the same aviary but these were removed
obviously because they would have scoffed a lot of the live food put in for the
rearing of the young starlings.
Here are the statistics: Incubation time - 14 days; Rearing time (hatching to
fledging) - 20 days for first bird, 22 days for second bird.

(Berkeley, California)
In marked contrast to Britain, where 18 collections, open to the public and
largely devoted to birds are listed in the 1986 International Zoo Yearbook
(Olney 1987), such institutions are presently rare in the United States. These
include two private commercial establishments, the Miami Parrot Jungle
(which recently changed hands) and Honolulu's Paradise Park, both emphasiz-
ing Psittaciform birds. (The famed bird collection at the Tampa Busch
Gardens is still very much in existence, but shares the spotlight with a major
mammal collection, while the Busch Gardens at Houston and Van Nuys, near
Los Angeles, ceased operations in the 1970s.) Two private, nonprofit collec-
tions, created for the express purpose of research and propagation are nomi-
nally open to the public; the International Crane Foundation, in Baraboo,
Wisconsin, and the Peregrine Fund's World Center for Birds of Prey, near
Boise, Idaho. There are a number of "Nature Centers" and "Junior Museums"
around the country, whose collections predominate towards birds, but, being
small, locally oriented, and often composed largely of rehabilitated specimens,
scarcely qualify as "Bird Parks". Finally, there are two municipal aviaries, run
as departments of their respective City Governments; The Tracy Aviary, in
Salt Lake City, and the Pittsburgh Conservatory Aviary, at Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.
The Pittsburgh Conservatory Aviary, opened in 1953 (Hawkins, 1954),
quickly gained international attention (Jones, 1968, Kirchshofer, 1968), with a
distinguished breeding record, only to go through a difficult period in the
1970s. In the last ten years, under its Australian-born Director, Dr. Lindsay
Clack, the Aviary has again attained world-class status.
The Tracy Aviary's 16.5 acres in Liberty Park, not very far from
Downtown and the famous Temple Square (or, as I discovered, the
airport),were for twenty years the site of Salt Lake City's Zoo, founded in
1912. In 1932 (Kirchshofer, 1968), the Zoo was relocated to a hillside high
above the city, across the road from the revered spot where Brigham Young
declared his Mormon followers' wanderings at an end. Named in honour of
the donor of the land, the Hogle Zoological Gardens, perhaps still most
famous for "Shasta", a Lion X Tiger hybrid, now long deceased, has under-
gone much recent improvement, is now a mainstream zoo, with many interest-
ing mammals and reptiles, and a comparatively small bird collection.
Naturally, there was some displeasure over this move, and, apparently,
some animals continued to be maintained, after a fashion, at Liberty Park.

Among the concerned parties were Mr. and Mrs. Russel L. Tracy, private avi-
culturists, whose social prominance may be gathered from a contemporary
account (Anon. 1936) of a garden party;
"Coming from near and far, nearly 8,000 persons swarmed over the spa-
cious lawns of the Russel L. Tracy home. . . on Saturday and Sunday, at the
first annual open house of 'Friendship Wall'.
"Two beautiful late summer afternoons lured the young and the old to the
Tracy home to see the 'Friendship Wall', constructed of 400 stones contribut-
ed by persons held in high esteem by Russel L. and Kate Tracy.
"Then there were the 150 'residents' of the spacious aviary 'at home' in
their finest feathers. The many imported birds from the tiny African wax bill
finch, hardly larger than a good-sized thumb, to the giant South American
golden pheasant with its gold and black striped head, were received with
shouts from the children and admiring sighs by the adults.
"The Tracys planned the open house so that the general public might enjoy
the unusual sight before fall sets in and the birds and fowl are transferred to
their winter quarters.
". . . Hundreds of personal friends of the Tracys extended their congratula-
tions on the open house, with state, county and city officials also attending."
In 1939, the Tracys donated their collection to the City, to establish a public
aviary at Liberty Park. A now somewhat weather beaten sign still stands;
"TRACY AVIARY - These birds, animals and children's pets, presented by
Mr. &amp; Mrs. Russel L. Tracy to the boys &amp; girls of Salt Lake."
The "animals" in question were primarily common hoofed-stock and mon-
keys, though for some years the Aviary was a major source of Red Kangaroos.
Mammals were finally phased out in the last five years.
While engaged in the reintroduction of Trumpeter Swans (Delacour, 1944,
Dolton, 1988), Jean Delacour (1947) made the following description of the
Aviary;
"I recently visited the Tracy aviaries at Salt Lake City. Under the excellent
care of Mr. Calvin Wilson and his assistant, a very good collection of birds is
maintained, the Parrots and Waterfowl being particularly interesting. Many
exotic species are represented among the latter, but the local ones are the more
remarkable. There are great numbers of birds on the ponds, the majority of
which are specimens that have been gathered on the nearby Utah State Refuge,
where they were found ill with botulism. . . By careful treatment in fresh clean
water 70 per cent of the birds are saved, which otherwise would have perished.
Other Ducks are reared from eggs gathered around the ponds. Mr. Wilson is
particularly successful with the charming little Ruddy Ducks; he has dozens of
them and they lay freely. Eggs are hatched in an incubator and reared in a
brooder. They are given access to open water immediately and are fed very
simply on Spratt's duck meal, and lettuce. Mr. Wilson tells me that the secret

of his success consists of putting a yearling female with the ducklings. Once
he was short of Ruddy females and he successfully substituted a female Lesser
Scaup, and it worked perfectly well. . .
"Mr. Wilson rears by hand every year such difficult birds as Avocets, Stilts,
Willets, various Gulls and Plovers, and this gives an idea of his patience and
skill. He finds that the most difficult chick he ever reared was that of the
Phalarope, which nests by the surrounding lakes. . . "
Calvin D. Wilson was Director of the Tracy Aviary from its inception in
1939 to his compulsory retirement, at the age of 75, in 1975. A life member of
the Avicultural Society (Prestwich, 1970), he died in 1983. He arrived in Salt
Lake City from the California Zoological Gardens (or "Selig Zoo") in Los
Angeles (Marvin Jones, pers. com.), the now-long-defunct, famed commercial
repository for Hollywood animals, distinguished for an important breeding
pair of White-naped Cranes (Mobley, 1933).
Marvin Jones, Registrar at the San Diego Zoo, and a long-time zoo histori-
an, kindly provided me with the unpublished notes of his 1969 visit with
Calvin Wilson at the Aviary. Typically, Mr. Jones took special note of signifi-
cant age records*, two 40 year-old Galahs Eolophus roseicapillus, a 46 year-
old Greater Sulphur-crested Cockatoo Cacatua g. galerita, a 12 year-old
Peruvian Ruddy Duck Oxyuraj amaicensis ferruginea, a 16 year-old Puna Teal
Anas versicolor puna, and a 30 year-old Cereopsis Goose Cereopsis n. novae-
hollandiae, all alive in 1969, as well as birds (presumed) no longer present; a
46 year-old Bare-eyed Cockatoo C. s. sanguinea, a 19 year-old Shoveller Anas
clypeata, a 22 year-old Whistling Swan Cygnus c. columbianus , and a Double-
wattled Cassowary Casuarius casuarius, 32 years old. Some notable birds pre-
sent in 1969 which were not there by 1980 were a Southern Spur-winged
Goose Plectropterus gambensis niger, two Chilean Pintails Anas georgica
spinicauda, four Australian Radjah Shelducks Tadorna radjah rufitergum , an

Calvin Wilson's distinguished aviculture, which also included, among other
things, the production of a number of hybrid Hyacinth X Blue-and-Gold
Macaws (Delacour, 1966), and the breeding of Trumpeter Swans (Prestwich,
1969), was conducted with only modest municipal funding. While the Aviary
was endowed with a series of spring-fed canals and ponds, the cages were
largely simple chainlink or wire and woodframe constructions. The first really
elaborate exhibit complex, a series of planted aviaries surrounding a circular

building, was dedicated as the "Calvin Wilson Bird Pavilion" in 1970.
Constructed for $150,000. it was the last major exhibit to be built for more
than a decade.
At my first visits to the Aviary, in 1980 and '81, although there were a
number of interesting species, especially waterfowl and gamebirds, there
seemed, in the absence of Mr. Wilson, to be a general atmosphere of tiredness
and lack of purpose, with little evidence of current collection policy or future
planning.
It was therefore with much anticipation that I learned of the appointment of
D. Grenville Roles as the Aviary's Director in 1984. Mr. Roles will be familiar
to long-time readers of this journal as the author of a series of articles on the
Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust's first British breedings of eight species of
birds (Roles 1970, 1971 a, b &amp; c, 1973 a &amp; b, and 1975 a &amp; b). He is also both
author and illustrator of Rare Pheasants of the World - A study of birds in cap-
tivity (Roles, 1976), reviewed in this magazine by Risdon (1977). Mr. Roles
left his position as Deputy Curator of Birds at Jersey, in 1975, for the
Penscynor Wildlife Park in South Wales, then was manager of a private collec-
tion in California for a number of years before coming to Salt Lake City.
The collection stood at roughly 150 species and subspecies of birds at the
time of Grenville's arrival. By 1st January 1986, the number had risen to 191,
an all-time high, I believe, in the Aviary's history. (There were about 130 taxa
in 1966 (Kirchshofer, 1968), and 1936 at the end of 1970 (Lucas &amp; Duplaix-
Hall, 1972) . ) On 1st January 1989, 220 taxa were counted, one of the largest
bird collections in the Western Hemisphere.
Bird purchases are endowed by the locally administered Tracy Fund to
which all proceeds from sales of Aviary birds return - a happy contrast to
many American municipal zoos, where the animal sales profits go into a civic
"general fund", from which the zoo may be allotted a portion. An Aviary
Advisory Board exercises a degree of control over bird purchases.
Within a year of his arrival, Grenville Roles created a second administra-
tive position, of Education Coordinator, to create an education programme.
Mark Stackhouse arrived from Ohio's Dayton Museum of Natural History to
fill this positon. His programmes involved 4, 500 persons in 1985, 10,400 in
1986, and 41,000 in 1987 (of whom 24,000 were visited in school classrooms,
7, 000 attended the Aviary's amphitheatre programme, and the rest participat-
ed in summer classes, field-trips, an annual "Nature Fair", and other activi-
ties). He also established the Friends of Tracy Aviary, a zoological society
which provides considerable local support, as well as an annual "adoption pro-
gram", where donors cover a bird's care for a year. Prices range from $10.00
for a Peafowl to $75.00 for eagles and Peregrine Falcons. Mr. Stackhouse's
staff of four part-time employees are also responsible for the care of most of
the local "rehab" birds brought to the collection, many of which are released.

Mr. Roles directly supervises two full-time and two part-time staff-mem-
bers, responsible for the rest of the bird collection. With the Aviary's office
secretary, there are thus only five full-time employees. Mr. Stackhouse discov-
ered, in an American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums
Directory of U.S. and Canadian collections, that only two member institutions
had smaller permanent staffs; a commercial "reptile-park", and a very small
zoo in Kansas. Mark found the average staff-size for an institution with 500 to
800 specimens was 65. On January 1, 1989, the Aviary held 869 specimens.
In spite of this relatively minuscule staff, I found everything in an impres-
sive state of affairs when I visited Tracy Aviary in October 1988, for the first
time in seven years. Although most of the old cages were still in use, land-
scaping was much improved, with attractive concrete walkways replacing
many shabby old asphalt walks. The entrance has been relocated, and is now a
new bridge crossing a waterfowl-filled canal.
Grenville Roles was away on the day of my visit, but I was given a cordial
tour by Mark Stackhouse. (I am also most grateful to Angela Balcar, then the
Aviary's Secretary, now elsewhere, for transportation from and to the airport,
enabling me to make the most of an unexpected "stopover" in Salt Lake City,
due to altered plane schedules).
Considering that the author of Rare Pheasants of the World is in charge,
one would expect to find the thirteen well planted compartments of the 1984
pheasantry, the first major construction since 1970, well-stocked. Such was the
case, with two pairs each of Edwards' and Elliot's Pheasants (both under-rep-
resented in American public collections), and Temminck's Tragopans, as well
as pairs of Cabot's and Satyr Tragopans, Cheer Pheasants (the male on loan
from Denver Zoo, where I first saw it in 1978), and Swinhoe's Pheasants, a
male Tibetan White Eared Pheasant Crossoptilon crossoptilon drouynii , and a
pair of Chinese Bamboo Partridges Bambusicola thoracica. A surprising fea-
ture of this complex was an intelligently selected series of Asian birds which
shared these cages; Spot-necked Doves Streptopelia chinensis , Great Barbets
Megalaima virens, Collared Finch-billed Bulbuls Spizixos semitorques , White-
crested, Lesser Necklaced and Red-tailed Laughing Thrushes Garrulax leu-
colophus, G. monileger, &amp; G. milnei , Redfaced Liocichlas Liocichla
phoenicea , Pekin Robins, Silver-eared Mesias, Japanese Grosbeaks
Coccothraustes personatus, a female Rothschild's Mynah, considered of par-
ticular genetic significance by the AAZPA's Species Survival Plan, to be there-
fore mated with care, and Red-billed Blue Magpies. All too often, pheasants
are kept by themselves, or else little care is given to ecological context (pheas-
ants with touracos, etc.). As far as I know, only San Diego has gone farther in
exhibiting appropriate pheasant communities.
To my knowledge, only the San Diego and Denver Zoos currently other-
wise exhibit Cabot's Tragopans in the U.S. The Tracy Aviary's pair was bred

in Canada. As ot May 1989, Grenville told me, fertile eggs have only been
produced through artificial insemination, and the resulting chicks were dead in
the shell. As they have only been in the collection since 1986, better results
should be forthcoming. In mid-November 1988, a pair of Mikado Pheasants, a
pair of Brown-eared Pheasants, and additional pairs of Cheer Pheasants and
Chinese Bamboo Partridges were purchased from the aviculturist Bill Kuhn.
Another female Cheer Pheasant arrived several days later from the Idaho
waterfowl breeder, Jerry Korn. As I am not aware of any other U.S. public
institution working with this species, it is encouraging that Tracy Aviary is
thus committed. I should here mention that Roy Bouck, one of Grenville's two
full-time aviculturists, has for many years maintained a private pheasant col-
lection, among which various Copper Pheasant subspecies and the bronze
mutation of the Impeyan Monal stand out. Grenville told me that Roy possess-
es the largest Impeyan cock he has seen.
Elsewhere on the grounds, along with the more standard sorts of pheasants,
a number of very rarely exhibited Galliform birds may be found. Sharing a
spacious Belden-wire corn-crib* with three Amherst Pheasants and a pair of
Thick-billed Parrots, were a pair of Red-legged Partridges Alectohs rufa, the
first I&amp;apos;d seen. Six specimens were counted on 1st January, 1989. I missed the
single Grey Partridge Perdix perdix, which I have never seen. In November,
after my visit, a pair of Barbary Partridges Alectoris barbara arrived from Bill
Kuhn.
The most startling of the Aviary's gamebirds was a beautiful pair of Blue
Grouse Dendragapus obscurus, in the collection since 1987, and most likely
the only captive specimens at present. Mark Stackhouse told me that, while
the chicks did not present great difficulties in husbandry, adults have tradition-
ally proved almost impossible to maintain. A major problem has been acco-
modating, in captivity, this species almost exclusive winter diet of Douglas Fir
Pseudotsuga menziesii needles. Mark informed me that every week in winter,
Aviary employees collect chopped-down Douglas Fir saplings, which supple-
ment Gamebird pellets. Without elaborating further, Mark said this high-tan-
nin diet produces "really remarkable droppings". This pair is at present the
Aviary's only Grouse, but an exhibit for a complete series of North American
Grouse and Quail is anticipated.
The Blue Grouse share a very large, beautifully planted, ramshackle, chick-
en-wired, wood-framed cage with a pair of American Kestrel Falco sparverius
that produced six fertile eggs in 1988. Two young were successfully reared in
this exhibit that year.
^Prefabricated corn-cribs of various dimensions have, for a number of years, been very
widely adapted as bird and mammal cages in zoos across the U.S.

A large, arched, chain-link cage, planted with tall Poplar-like trees, is the
site of the first public collection breeding of the Cooper's Hawk Accipiter
cooperii. Although it is an abundant bird in the Western states, and notorious
for harassing aviary inhabitants, like other members of its genus, it is very
rarely exhibited, although, Mark Stackhouse informed me, roughly 50 have
been bred privately. Although Mark told me a wild pair nests on the Aviary
grounds, I still found it remarkable that breedings take place in this very pub-
lic exhibit. The adult pair were exhibited, at my visit, with the male and
female hatched in 1987. As it had been found that the parents ate their chicks
at six days, these two had been hand-raised and later reintroduced. It is eventu-
ally intended to release them. In 1988, four chicks were hatched, but none sur-
vived.
The Tracy Aviary owns two of the nine Andean Condors produced by the
famous breeding pair at the San Diego Zoo between 1942 and 1952 (Lint, 1959
&amp; 1961). Marvin Jones informed me that these birds, both males, were the
second hatching, of 8th June 1945, and eighth of 23rd May 1951, the first of
its species to be incubator-hatched and hand-reared. Both were, in fact, sent
first to Salt Lake City's Hogle Zoo. The date of this transaction, and that of
their transfer to the Aviary, are not now available. Presently, one of these birds
(which, I am not certain), "a confirmed wife-killer", as Mark Stackhouse
informed me, is on exhibit loan to a small zoo in Utah. Though the remaining
male "courts massively", Mark tells me the Aviary's female "never looks
interested", and is thus slated for replacement.
Other bird-of-prey exhibits include an open meadow for nonreleasable
pairs of Bald and Golden Eagles, the latter frequently engaged in mating activ-
ities, and recently renovated aviaries for pairs of Swainson's Hawks Buteo
swainsoni, Turkey Vultures Cathartes aura , and Snowy Owls. I especially
liked the Swainson's Hawk's cage, decorated with clever artficial Cliff
Swallow nests.
A number of non-releasable birds-of-prey are included in the collection of
the Education Department and appear in the very popular amphitheatre
demonstrations, or travel to schools. Along with the commoner local species
are American Peregrine Falcons Falco peregrinus anatum and a Northern
Pygmy Owl Glaucidium gnoma in the collection since 1986. Other interesting
Education Department birds include an imprinted Flicker Colaptes auratus
and a Western Meadowlark Sturnella neglecta , also hand-reared, which
learned its song from House Finches Carpodacus mexicanus in Mark
Stackhouse's backyard, and maintains great composure when released from its
cage in the midst of a circle of mealworm-proffering children.
Of the Education Program birds, I found the most singular to be two
Common Nighthawks Chordeiles minor , one acquired as a broken-winged
adult in 1986, the other brought in as a fledgling in 1987. Both are wonderful-

ly tame and handlable, appearing at schools and the amphitheatre, readily
demonstrating their enormous gapes. One that Mark Stackhouse brought out
and set on a lawn for me to examine made no attempt to escape, eagerly inves-
tigating the edible potential of my fingers. Grenville Roles told me they
receive dogfood and a commercial bird-of-prey diet, rolled into little balls,
supplimented with crickets and mealworms, all hand-fed.
Their sex, when I visited, was unknown. They are maintained together in a
spacious indoor, off-exhibit cage shared with one Broad-tailed and four Black-
chinned Hummingbirds Selasphorus platycercus &amp; Archilochus alexandri ,
received as nestlings, and two hand-reared Bam Swallows Hirundo rustica
erythrogaster . It will be interesting to see if these two Nighthawks eventually
exceed the eight years and two months captive-longevity record of a bird that
died at the Assiniboine Park Zoo, at Winnipeg, Manitoba, on 29th September
1984 (Lindholm, 1989).
Mark Stackhouse told me the Aviary has released other Nighthawks, as
well as another Caprimulgid, the Poorwill Phalaenoptilus nuttallii. Among
other birds brought there for rehabilitation in 1988, were five Bohemian
Waxwings Bombycilla garrulus pallidiceps, in a small temporary cage, all in
beautiful condition, continuously twittering. They will be retained for perma-
nent exhibit. Fifteen local Hummingbirds were received in 1988, including
two Calliopes Stellula calliope , the smallest U.S. species, that were success-
fully released. At present, Tracy Aviary does not have exhibit facilities for
Hummingbirds, but one for both local and exotic species is anticipated shortly.
The tradition, noted by Delacour (1947), of collecting young local shore-
birds, continues at Tracy Aviary. Two young Black-necked Stilts Himantopus
mexicanus, and three American Avocets Recurvirostra americana were thus
obtained on 20th June 1988, joining, respectively, one and five birds already in
the collection. Collected on the same field-trip were six Cinnamon Teal duck-
lings Anas cyanoptera septentrionalium*, joining four specimens, and six
Yellow-headed Blackbirds Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus , making up a
unique captive group of four males and five females of North America's
largest Icterid "Blackbird". All four of these native species are exhibited in the
largest of the old cages, a great domed aviary with an extensive pool, also
occupied by Blue-winged Teal A. discors, of which a number were purchased
in 1988, Laysan Teal A. platyrhynchos laysanensis. Ringed Teal Callonetta
leucophrys, a Long-billed Curlew Numenius americanus, hopefully to be
joined by a bird at the Hogle Zoo, a pair of the black-headed Franklin's Gull
Larus pipixcan, and a prolific colony of Western Mourning Doves Zenaida
macroura marginella.
*More than half of the individuals of this, the North American subpecies, breed in Utah
(Todd 1979).

Most of Tracy Aviary's 48 species and subspecies of ducks, geese and
swans, are maintained in open enclosures along spring-fed canals, or in a con-
nected small lake, which the new entrance bridge crosses. Seventeen taxa of
waterfowl hatched in 1988, among them being one American Goldeneye
Bucephala clangula americana, two Northern Ruddy Ducks Oxyura j.
jamaicensis, five Hooded Mergansers Mergus cucullatus , four Cinnamon Teal,
eight Great Basin Canada Geese Branta canadensis moffitti , three Pacific
White-fronted Geese Anser albifrons frontalis, and three Black-necked Swans.
Other interesting species listed on 1st January 1989 included two Greater
Snow Geese Anser caerulescens atlanticus, two Ross's and four Emperor
Geese, six Nenes or Hawaiian Geese, three Dusky Canada Geese Branta
canadensis occidentalism a very distinctive and rarely displayed subspecies,
two Red-breasted Geese, a pair of Ruddy-headed Geese Chloephaga rubidi-
ceps , four New Zealand Shelduck, two Marbled Teal, two female Common
Eiders of undesignated subspecies, five Canvasbacks Aythya valisineria, twen-
ty-two Redheads A. americana , also breeding in 1988, and two Ringnecked
Ducks A. collaris. Six male and ten female Northern Ruddy Ducks were
inventoried. A welcome recent addition are four Falcated Teal Anas falcata,
which arrived November 29, 1988, with "Silver" and wild-type Lesser
Bahama Pintails A. b. bahamensis, and a second pair of Emperor Geese from
the Idaho breeder, Jerry Korn. Wild Wood Ducks and Mallards are constant
"visitors".
Twenty eight species and subspecies of parrots appear on the January 1989
inventory, currently an unusually large collection for an American public insti-
tution, with an emphasis on New World species. This is a change from the
past, when the Aviary's selection of Parrots tended more towards Australian
species. It appears the collection policy is now aimed more towards species
not so popular with private aviculturists. Of the Broadtails, only the very
rarely exhibited Port Lincoln Parrot Barnardius z. zonarius is now present,
with a pair in their own aviary, and another male held off-exhibit inside the
Wilson Pavilion. The pair, which hatched, but did not rear, three-chicks in
1988, are not kept far from one of the Aviary's three pairs of Northern Thick-
billed Parrots Rhynchopsitta p. pachyrhyncha. Another pair are also kept by
themselves, while the third pair share a corn-crib with the afore-mentioned
Red-legged Partridges (which are breeding), and Amherst&amp;apos;s Pheasants. I was
surprised to hear that Thick-billed Parrots were first bred at Tracy Aviary in
1965, within days of the world first captive breeding record at the San Diego
Zoo on 8th September. I am not aware of the exact date. Marvin Jones found
three birds at the Aviary at his visit on 10th December, 1969. Of the six birds
now in the collection, one each is on breeding loan from the private avicultur-
ist Jim Singleton, the San Diego Zoo, and the Sacramento Zoo, in California,
which has been especially successful with this species. Another arrived as a

gift from the San Diego Zoo in 1988. The Aviary's original breeding female,
in captivity more than thirty years, is still there, its mate having died this past
winter. Grenville Roles informed me that a female offspring of this pair was
sent, in 1988, to Dr. Noel Snyder, for his Arizona re-introduction programme
(Snyder &amp; Wallace, 1987).
Other parrots, at various locations in the grounds, include a breeding pair
of Alexandrine Parakeets Psittacula eupatria, with Silver Pheasants, a pair of
Tibetan Parakeets P. derbiana in a corn-crib with a pair of Blue Eared
Pheasants, a breeding colony of six Nanday Conures Nandayus nenday in the
same aviary with eleven Quaker Parrots Myiopsitta monachus, also breeding,
and a prolific colony of 13 Lesser Patagonian Conures Cyanoliseus p.
patagonus in their own cage.
Tracy Aviary still holds one of the Hyacinth X Blue-and-Gold Macaw
hybrids that so impressed Jean Delacour (1966), now part of the Education
collection, and described as Hybridus monstrosusl Two pairs of Blue-and-
Gold Macaws are now in the collection, as well as a pair of Hyacinths, the lat-
ter sharing, with two male Black Korhaans Afrotis atra afraoides, one of a
series of aviaries constructed from open pens formerly for mammals and
ground birds, arranged around a carriage-house-like structure. The other parrot
species exhibited in this section is the Greater Vasa Coracopsis vasa, a bird
that the Aviary, with the close cooperation of the Avicultural Society of Utah,
is especially committed to propagate. Of the five specimens in the collection
in May 1989, two had been on loan from the Society since 1986 (when the
Aviary obtained another pair) while the fifth, a male, is a recent donation by
the Society, procured expressly as a mate for the older female, the first of its
species to lay eggs in captivity (three were laid in 1988). This hen's aggres-
siveness is likely the cause of thus far clear eggs. It is hoped a change of mates
will produce better results. At my October 1988 visit, all the Greater Vasas
were in winter holding in the Calvin Wilson Pavilion.
In the other former paddocks in this complex, at my visit, were five
Vulturine Guineafowl kept with a breeding pair of West African Crowned
</bodyText>
<reference confidence="0.593648090909091">
Cranes, Triangular Spotted Pigeons Columba guinea with a Grey Peacock
Pheasant, Great Crowned Pigeons, Blacksmith Plovers , and a San Diego Wild
Animal Park-bred Hammerkop that had killed its mate, a female European
Wood Pigeon, perhaps the only one in the country, for which Grenville has yet
to find a mate, kept with Victoria Crowned Pigeons, and pairs of Stanley
Cranes and European White Storks, each in their own display.
Near these avairies are large yards for "Blue-necked" Ostriches of unspeci-
fied subspecies, and Emus kept with Demoiselle Cranes.
Perhaps the Aviary's rarest parrots are the two pairs of Bodin's Amazons
Amazona festiva bodini, together at my visit, sharing with rarely seen Crested
Bobwhite Quail Colinus cristatus one of the 14 aviaries that make up the

exhibits of the Calvin Wilson Pavilion. Mark Stackhouse told me that only
eight others were in the U.S., imported , with the Aviary's birds, in 1987. I
found these robust, red-browed birds especially attractive.
An adjoining aviary held a wonderful group of four Slenderbilled Conures
Enicognathus leptorhynchus, all actively digging in the dirt floor of their
exhibit, with only their dark-red tails visible. I counted seven holes. 1988 was
an unusually productive year for this species, one pair successfully rearing six
chicks, the other pair seven, both in February. All of these offspring, and the
three hatched in 1987, were sold or exchanged to private parties in 1988. I am
not aware of any other U.S. public display of these distinctive, temperate-cli-
mate parrots, which have been at Tracy Aviary since 1986.
Next to the Slenderbill's cage, a pair of Hawk-headed Parrots Deroptyus
accipitrinus shared their exhibit with three Neotropical Lapwings or Teru-
Terus Vanellus chilensis. A pair of Redfronted Macaws Ara rubrogenys shared
their display with a Zenaida Dove Zenaida aurita, hardly ever seen in public
collections although it is present in American private aviculture, and Elegant
Crested Tinamous Eudromia elegans conversely, by far the most commonly
seen tinamou in zoos.
Two exhibits in this complex held pairs of Red-billed Toucans Ramphastos
tucanus, a great rarity ten years ago, but now imported in some numbers from
Surinam. One pair was kept with Razor-billed Currasows, the other was by
itself but had shared its cage with Red-legged Seriemas. A pair of Toco
Toucans were exhibited with pairs of Great Currasow, Ringed Teal, and
recently acquired Silver Teal Anas v. versicolor , in a nicely sodded display. A
trio of Piping Guans Aburria pipile were by themselves. Further pairs of
Ringed and Silver Teal occuped an aviary planted with Japanese Maples,
shared with two Mountain Witches or Crested Quail Doves Geotrygon versi-
color, Red-crested Cardinals Paroaria coronata , a pair of White-faced Ibis
Plegadis chihi, and two young Scarlet Ibis from Disney World's "Discovery
Island", in Florida. It is intended that two "Discovery Island"-bred Scarlet
Ibises will arrive each year until a dozen have been sent.
Two aviaries in the Wilson Pavilion held groups of small perching birds. I
was especially pleased to see, in one, a true pair of Green Cardinals
Gubernatrix cristata, a bird no longer exported, with a handful remaining in
U.S. aviculture, yet, at the same time, possessing a potential for prolific repro-
duction. Another species that stood out in the same cage were seven of the
well-known Red or Dwarf Turtle Dove Streptopelia tranquebarica , the first I
had seen. Although it is not uncommon in private aviculture, it is, I think
oddly, an extremely rare U.S. public exhibit at present. The Aviary reared two
this year. Other birds in this aviary were a Crested Finch Lophospingus pusil-
lus, an indistinctly-seen Black-and-White Seedeater Sporophila luctuosa , and
several I did not see; a Ruddy Quail Dove Geotrygon montana, a male

Hooded Siskin Carduelis magellanica, in the collection at least four years, and
a male Painted Bunting Passerina ciris of similar age.
I did see one of the two male Lazuli Buntings Passerina amoena which
share an exhibit with a beautiful male Bullock's Oriole (the Western race of
the Northern Oriole Icterus galbula bullockii), Saffron Finches Sicalis flaveo-
la, and a pair of Palawan Peacock Pheasants.
At my 1980 and 1981 visits, I had been intrigued by Grey Peacock
Pheasants labelled as Polyplectron bicalcaratum ghigii , the Vietnamese and
Laotian subspecies, named by Delacour and Jabouille after their august
Bolognese friend. A pair, sharing a Wilson Pavilion cage with a pair of Red-
beaked Hornbills and North American Bobwhites, was still thus labelled in
1988. Grenville Roles, however, is not convinced that the Aviary's birds are
identifiable as to their subspecies. At any rate, the other pair that I saw, in an
afore-mentioned exhibit with Great Crowned Pigeons and a Hammerkop, were
not subspecifically identified.
A final cage in the Wilson Complex held a pair of Blue-crowned Motmots,
a pair af Sun Bitterns, and a further pair of Elegant Crested Tinamous.
Since my visit, one of the Wilson Pavilion aviaries has been converted to
an exhibit for a pair of Bat Falcons Falco rufigularis that arrived on loan from
the World Center for Birds of Prey, in Idaho, on November 3, 1988. The other
American "zoo" specimen I am aware of is one that the New York Zoological
Park exhibited in its World Of Darkness in the 1970's.
The interior of the Wilson Pavilion is to be eventually remodelled into a
sky-lit South American walk-through aviary, but presently serves as a winter-
storage facility, with birds being temporarily housed there for other reasons as
well. Among the more interesting specimens at my visit were a recently mated
Galah or Rose-breasted Cockatoo with the pinkest crest I have seen,
Alexandrine Parakeets Psittacula eupatria, two recently obtained Dusky
Parrots Pionus fuscus, a breeding pair of Pink-crested Touracos with some off-
spring in a separate cage, Port Lincoln Parrots, Derbyan Parakeets, Rufous
Tree-pies Dendrocitta vagabunda , a female King Vulture, for which a male
had yet to be found, the afore-mentioned Greater Vasa Parrots, and two
Umbrella Cockatoos.
Along with the conversion of this facility into a South American exhibit,
and the afore-mentioned anticipated North American Game-bird Pavilion and
Hummingbird house, a number of new displays are planned for the next few
years, including a new flamingo enclosure (I saw five Chileans), a tropical
pheasantry and, particularly intriguing, twin exhibit complexes for birds of
Utah and the Andes, presenting a series of altitudinal communities. The con-
tinued development of this revived, world-class collection promises to be most
interesting.

THE WHITE STORK: A CAPSULE OVERVIEW OF ITS STATUS IN
THE WILD AND THE ROLE OF CAPTIVE REARED AND BRED

In 1988 it was estimated that the total world population of the European
White Stork did not exceed 490,000 and of these only 100,000 were 'western'
birds, i.e. those over-wintering in West Africa (Goriup, 1988). These can be
sub-divided into those breeding either in western and northern Europe (just
35,000 nesting storks) or in the Maghreb (north-west Africa). The remaining
'eastern' birds breed in eastern Europe and migrate via the Bosphorous to
over-winter in east- and southern Africa (Fig. 1). This 1988 population figure
represents a dramatic decrease over the last one hundred years, particularly in
the north and west of the European range. Regular censuses carried out since
1934 show this all too clearly (Table 1). Since 1974 alone the number of
White Storks breeding in western Europe has declined by 20% and the future
looks even more bleak. The last regular breeding of the White Stork in
Belgium was in 1895, in Switzerland, 1949 and in Sweden, 1954 and it has
become effectively extinct as a breeding bird in Denmark, France and the
Netherlands, virtually restricting the western population to the Iberian penin-
sula.
White Stork numbers are more stable on the eastern European breeding
grounds (including Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and
Yugoslavia), with recent increases and expansions being noted in the Soviet
Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Russia. Why this dramatic decline of the
western population and what action is required to rectify the situation?
The White Stork is a bird whose very livelihood is dependent upon, and
intricately linked with man's activities and, of course, the environmental con-
ditions in two continents. There are multiple pressures on the birds in both
their breeding and wintering grounds and further hazards are encountered each
spring and autumn on the long migration flights. Reductions in food resources
(linked to drought and habitat destruction), hunting, collision with overhead
power lines and pesticides have all been cited as having detrimental effects on
the White Stork.
On the breeding grounds changes in agricultural practices have altered the
habitats previously preferred by the White Stork and (as might have been
expected) its numbers have declined most drastically where such changes have
been greatest: in the Netherlands, the Upper Rhine valley, northern Germany
and Denmark. Fertilizer and pesticide use has increased and the drainage of
wetlands has resulted in the loss of feeding grounds on a massive scale. As

land drainage lowers the water table the supply of earthworms, an important
food source for newly-hatched birds, is rapidly depleted. The high levels of
persistent pesticides and industrial chemicals, particularly PCB's, in central
and eastern Europe are likely to be having severe effects on White Stork
reproduction and in the opinion of Schulz (1988) the levels of PCB's found in
eggs in Germany and Holland do affect breeding and may be the single most
important factor threatening the White Stork in Europe.
By comparison, in parts of eastern Europe, still existing wetlands are good
breeding grounds and particularly in southern Poland, extensions of pasture
land, clover and alfalfa cultures favour stork populations.
Why, however, do many apparently still suitable areas for White Storks in
western Europe, some adjacent to 'inhabited' areas in eastern Europe, remain
unoccupied? Scientists and conservationists have had to look to the migration
routes and wintering grounds for the cause of the problem.
On migration, hunting is one of the most frequently quoted threats to the
White Stork, although caution is needed here since hunting is more easily
detected than death through either food shortage or habitat loss. Fewer than
1,000 White Storks now fly through the Pyrenees on migration (Francois
Sagot, pers. comm. 1989) but once they were prime targets for the sportsmen
who shot in the mountains each spring and autumn. Fortunately, this practice
is becoming less and less common as more areas become protected by conser-
vationists.
Hunting is still a problem in parts of North Africa and the Middle East. In
Syria and Lebanon as many as 6,000 of the 'eastern' storks may be shot annu-
ally: good sport for well-to-do citizens and target practice for bored Lebanese
soldiers. In Egypt the Nubians and Bedouins still hunt White Storks for food,
using both firearms and primitive traps (Schulz, 1988; Goriup, pers. comm.,
1989).

In other countries on both the eastern and western migration routes the
White Stork is protected by cultural respect, for example in Israel, Algeria and
Tunisia. In Israel the most frequent reported cause of death is collision with
over-head cables. In addition, pesticide use in Israel is very high and likely to
affect the storks at their stop-over sites. The main worry on the migration
routes is habitat loss, through man-made drought, water regulation and agri-
cultural development.
It is, however, in the African wintering grounds that the over-riding prob-
lems are to be found. Just how the environmental conditions in Africa affect
the White Stork's survival there has been graphically and clearly discussed by
Dallinga &amp; Schoenmakers (1987), to whose publication the reader is referred
for an in-depth account of the problems outlined below.
The greater decline of the western population can be understood when one
realises the enormous extent to which drought and habitat alteration have
depleted the food resources of the White Stork in West Africa. Drought has hit
West Africa particularly badly, reducing the supply of migratory locusts which
were once the primary food of the stork in sub-Saharan Africa. This affect has
been augmented by intensive anti-locust campaigns.
Up until 1960 storks arrived in West Africa in August and spent two to
three months in the southern Saharan breeding grounds of locusts and
grasshoppers, taking advantage of the insect swarms before they migrated far-
ther south. The current situation in West Africa is somewhat different. Twenty
years of heavy, indiscriminate use of pesticides to control locusts almost com-
pletely eradicated the insect and if outbreaks do occur now they are quickly
dealt with by use of Dieldrin. Consequently the White Stork has been forced
to winter in more southern savannas where locusts are naturally less abundant.
The birds become scattered in small groups and in attempts to find food they
concentrate around drying pools to eat fish; also around bush fires, where
again they come under severe hunting pressure (Thiollay, 1983).
Reduced food supply is not such a problem in East Africa. Firstly, the areas
important to storks have been less hard hit by drought. Secondly the 'eastern'
population arrives in ATrica at the beginning of the rainy season when insect
abundance is at a maximum, whereas the 'western' storks arrive at the end of
the rain when the food supply is running out, and thirdly, the potential winter-
ing area is very much larger in the east. A small number of 'western' storks
winter in the northern-most parts of Cameroon but countries farther south (i.e.
Gabon, Equatorial Guinea and Congo) are all mostly covered in tropical rain-
forest and have little suitable habitat for White Storks (Schulz, 1988). The
'eastern storks', on the other hand, have the whole length and breadth of East
and southern Africa to scour for food, from the arid areas of Sudan where
locusts are the main food source, to Kenya and Tanzania where armyworm
outbreaks are important succour, to the natural wetlands of southern Africa

where lucerne moth caterpillars, small rodents and amphibians are eaten.
It is not just drought that has turned much of the west African Sahel into a
sub-desert, much less able to support migrant birds. Over the past 30 years
human populations in West Africa have exploded above the carrying capacity
of the land, necessitating rapid changes in land-use and agricultural practices
to meet the demands of the still-growing population. With conservation needs
taking a back-seat, irrigation schemes and over-grazing (on top of the last 20
years of low rainfall) have had hugely deleterious effects on the landscape for
wildlife, pushing migrants further south into sub-optimal areas. Linked to the
increasing need for food, the White Stork is also threatened by poaching in
West Africa. (Hunting pressures are minimal, if they exist at all, in East
Africa.) There is also growing concern in West Africa about the undesirable
effects on wildlife of the increased use of pesticides against agricultural pests
of rice, cotton and sugar cane, and about the chemical control of pests such as
the tsetse fly (Thiollay, 1983; Walsh, 1985).
Conservationists know that the only long-term solution to the decline of the
White Stork is an improvement in the conditions on African wintering
grounds. Stricter legislation and subsequent enforcement is needed in areas
where hunting and the indiscriminate use of chemicals is a problem and
attempts must be made to manage the environment so that the needs of both
man and wildlife are reconciled.
It is no surprise that despite the efforts of some Europeans to tempt back
the lucky White Stork, the birds are not returning in the spring as they once
did.
In one West German village, Stapelholm, traditional farming methods are
being maintained to provide feeding grounds for the storks. Five thousand
acres of marshland have been set aside to build up the numbers of frogs, which
form a significant proportion of the storks' diet. Furthermore, electric cables
are run underground to prevent storks from flying into them and special nest-
ing platforms are erected to overcome the problem of the loss of nest sites:
new buildings are often unable to support storks&amp;apos; nests.
Artificial nests have been put up elsewhere, with encouraging results. Ovei
half of Hungary's 4,774 pairs of White Storks nest in 'nestbaskets' which have
been mounted on telegraph poles, sufficiently raised above the cables to pre
vent electrocution (Gyorgy Kallay, pers. comm. 1989).
There was a glimmer of hope in France in the spring of 1989, wher
between five and eight new pairs of White Storks nested, four of them on arti
ficial platforms erected by the French Bird Protection Organisation, LPO, if
the Charente-Maritime region.
It had to be accepted, however, that such attempts, intended to help restore
the White Stork to its former status in northern and western parts of Europe bj
habitat conservation on the breeding grounds, would not work on a big scale

This presented Europeans with a dilemma: the extinction of the White Stork in
Europe was dependent on factors operating in the migration and wintering
countries. Should they therefore accept this extinction or should they try to
save this much loved and admired species by programmes involving captive
breeding and subsequent release? Such programmes have been, and still are
being developed in northern and western Europe, despite the argument of
many conservationists that this kind of manipulation of, and interference with
nature is wrong and may, in the long term, cause "fundamental injuries for
nature and species conservation" (Rheinwald, 1985).
The first experiment in White Stork re-introduction was in Switzerland. An
experimental station was set up in 1948 and by 1985 there were a total of 22
sub-stations from which 32 Tree pairs' were known to have bred (Bloesh,
1985). The basis of such programmes is that captive storks lose the urge to
migrate, although in theory their offspring will still do so. This experiment
paved the way for similar such experiments in other countries.
After the erection of artificial nests to attract White Storks in Holland had
failed, the Dutch Bird Protection society, in its 70th anniversary (1969), set up
a 'Stork Village' - 'Het Liesveld' - in Groot-Ammers, 30km east of
Rotterdam. As in Switzerland, the aim was to breed storks at a main station
and release them in pairs at substations (or 'buitenstations') in environmental-
ly favourable areas.
The Dutch primary station started with 18 storks and the project developed
rapidly. In August 1989 there was a constant population of about 240 at 'Het
Liesveld' and in September of this year the 12th substation was opened. The
only full-time member of staff working on the project is the manager of 'Het
Liesveld', Mr A W Smits. Otherwise, the operation of the sub-stations
depends on enthusiastic volunteers. For example, the Director of the project,
Mr Kees Vos is an airline pilot and in his spare time runs the sub-station at
Herwijnen. The project is financed mainly by gifts and through various fund-
raising activities, including an 'Adopt a Stork' scheme: an offer which has
been taken up by HRH Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands and in 1989 Mr
Vos adopted the project's stork number 1000.
The standard rearing procedure at 'Het Liesveld' (described by Vos 1985)
is to place pairs in cages (10m x 10m x 2m) with a low-standing nest to breed
in. A recent advance which has greatly increased pairing success has been the
refinement of sexing techniques involving chromosome tests, which are now
more than 90% reliable. Offspring of the captive pairs have to be 'grounded'
for four years, (i.e. until they reach sexual maturity) since only pairs of storks
are released or moved to other stations. The birds are grounded, firstly by
wing-clipping (for two years) and for a further two years with wing-bands.
The bands are swapped between wings every eight weeks to prevent stiffening
of the muscles.

The storks are hand-fed all the year around, being unable to forage for
themselves. The feeding regime is strict, with daily afternoon feeds of chick-
en, mice and rats. It has been found that during very cold periods extra food
must be given to the storks early in the morning in order to "activate" them.
At 'Het Lies veld' some of the pairs are kept to perpetuate the population
there, whilst others are used to set up sub-stations, a process which began in
1978, when numbers in the main station had increased sufficiently to move
some storks out with the hope of eventually releasing them. The sub-stations
are carefully chosen so as to provide adequate nesting and feeding areas. Each
has two 2m-high cages with nests ready to receive a pair of storks from the
main station. This happens in the autumn and the pair is accompanied by 4
one-year 'ground storks', which are put into the enclosed area surrounding the
cages. After allowing six months for the birds to accept their new environment
the pair is released and the sub-station's cages re-stocked from either the
'ground birds' or from the main station. It is found that the adult pairs do not
migrate when set free, being used to having winter feeds at the main station,
which are continued at the sub-stations. Instead they occupy one of the nearby
artificial nests which are specially erected for this purpose. Quickly it becomes
a self-supporting system. The captive birds may also be added to nests of wild
storks if only one of the wild pair returns to the nest. Any offspring the
released pair have subsequently should still have the urge to migrate and
indeed, particularly when several young are produced in a sub-station, they do
leave the nest area in the autumn (as a group). However, whether they are able
to migrate 'properly' to Africa is doubtful. Vos (1985) reports that some sup-
posedly migratory storks went only as far as Belgium, just 140 km.
The Dutch project is certainly succeeding in increasing the numbers of
White Storks in the Netherlands and the prospect of being able to set up new
sub-stations and replenish the main station seems to be a reality. The Dutch
estimate that their country has room for 25 sub-stations and that this number
might allow a self-sustaining population to be established and the main station
closed down.
Similar but less ambitious projects exist in Belgium, Sweden and West
Germany. The feral population of White Storks at the Zwinn reserve at
Knokke, Belgium, originate from birds imported from southern Europe in
1957. As in Holland the storks are fed throughout the winter. Eleven pairs bred
in 1989 and six young fledged. The young rarely attempt to migrate.
In Sweden the hope of a recently set-up breeding programme at Karups
Nygard is that the experimental storks might be joined by some of the vagrant
White Storks which visit Sweden each May; about 20 birds from East
Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, perhaps eventually re-establishing the
White Stork as a breeding species in Sweden (Jonsson, 1989).

Ribeauville in Alsace, France, with one hundred White Storks supplied by a
captive breeding programme at Strasbourg Zoo. The Hunawihr centre is par-
ticularly concerned with public education; the storks are very tame and people
can learn about stork biology and conservation at the Visitors' Centre. The
birds fly freely, in a vast aviary of more than one third of an acre, enclosed by
a net held up by the tops of the trees. Artificial nests have been erected among
the trees. Some of the captive storks have been used to re-populate previously
used nests in Alsace and some are being paired with wild birds.
As well as stocking the Hunawihr centre, Strasbourg Zoo has been releas-
ing White Storks within Strasbourg itself; for the first time in thirty years
storks have been seen in the city. Breeding is closely monitored and manipu-
lated by two couples, the Gangloffs and the Schmitts. They put in "lots of hard
work and around the clock presence" but are rewarded with a high level of
success: in 15 years 378 storks have been reared (Gangloff &amp; Schmitt, 1985).
'Double-clutching' is a method used to increase the numbers of eggs. This
involves the first clutches being removed and artificially incubated. The par-
ents usually lay again and the second clutches remain with the parents. This all
happens in incubators in the Schmitt's house but at three weeks old the chicks
become too large and are moved to the Gangloff's basement garage where
there are large nests on the ground. There they remain for a further three
weeks before being transferred to the zoo, into outside nests well away from
the public.
The ultimate aim of many, if not all of these re-introduction centres is to
reduce the captive programmes as soon as a self-sustaining population is
reached but even then there is doubt whether these 'new generation' birds will
ever behave as do truly wild storks. Perhaps this is an academic point anyway,
since unless significant changes occur in the African wintering grounds in
favour of the White Stork, the need to maintain European stocks by captive
breeding will never cease. The White Stork will remain on a permanent 'life-
support machine'. Apart from keeping the species alive for scientific research
and for our children and grand-children to see, the efforts of such reintroduc-
tion projects might be largely in vain, the unavoidable truth being that the
White Stork is a victim of what man, to an ever greater extent, is doing to our
environment.

ly little is known about their breeding, biology and behaviour in the wild
or in captivity.
The genus Coracopsis comprises only two species: the Greater Vasa
Parrot Coracopsis vasa and the Lesser Vasa Parrot Coracopsis nigra. The
Greater Vasa Parrot is sometimes simply referred to as the Vasa Parrot and
the Lesser is also known as the Black Parrot.
Both species are similar in having a rather dull blackish or greyish-
brown plumage and unusual in their loud song-like calling - although to
my ear that of the Greater Vasa is less attractive than the song of its small-
er relative. Neither species is presently considered endangered but the
island race of the Lesser Vasa Coracopsis nigra barklyi occurring on
Praslin L, is one of the world's most endangered Parrots.
Chester Zoo has successfully bred Lesser Vasa Parrots since 1985 but
similar success with the Greater Vasa has, until this year, eluded us.
A pair of Greater Vasas were purchased from a private collection in
February 1985 and, since then, have been held in one of the outside
aviaries close to Oakfield House. These were surgically sexed and the
female wore a gold and the male a black metal leg-band.
Their aviary, measuring 4.5 x 4.5 x 2.2 metres, has a solid back wall
and is partly covered. No additional shelter has been necessary for these
birds, which have proved to be quite hardy, although not yet tested by a
really severe winter. Diet has been as for most of the other larger parrots
and consists of a basic parrot seed mixture containing striped sunflower
seeds, peanuts, pine nuts, wheat, safflower and maize, plus dry brown
bread, and a general animal feed pellet (SDS Zoo Diet 'A'). Fresh fruit and
vegetables, usually apples, pears, grapes, tomatoes and lettuce, are provid-
ed daily.
Since their arrival the pair had been provided with a grandfather clock-
type nest-box which was half-filled with peat and wood shavings.
As for the Lesser Vasas, the Greaters undergo a number of physical

changes in the breeding season. Both sexes show a change in bill colour
with the bill paling to a whitish-brown and in full breeding condition both
also show extensive cloacal protrusions although they are usually only vis-
ible on the males.
Unlike the Lesser Vasa however, the female Greater Vasa becomes
bald-headed when breeding and the bare skin then revealed on the top of
the head, around the eyes and on the throat takes on an ochre yellow
colour. This must result from hormonal changes and is not caused by
plucking by the male as has been suggested by one previous author. No
extensive feather loss occurs in the male, although this year a small bag-
like area of bare skin below the lower mandible was noticeable on one
male.
The pair of Greater Vasas has produced eggs since 1987, but although
the female spent much time inside the nest-box, the eggs were found out-
side on the aviary floor. In 1987 two eggs were found on the aviary floor
on the 15th June and a third on 18th June. Dummy eggs were placed
inside the nest-box to encourage the hen to lay there and the eggs removed
for artificial incubation but proved infertile.
In 1988 two eggs were again found on the aviary floor, one on 4th June
and the second three days later. Again the female spent much time on the
nest-box and both eggs were infertile.
Similar behaviour was observed in 1989 but then a total of five eggs
was laid on the aviary floor between 28th May and 8th June. That year a
lot of chasing of the male by the female was also noted. This might have
been the consequence of his not being in breeding condition at the same
time as the female or a basic incompatibility between the two birds.
Chasing of the males by the females, however, had been observed in the
Lesser Vasas and appeared for them to be a normal part of their social
behaviour and displays. The laying of eggs outside the nest-box and the
fact that, for three years these were infertile however, indicated there was a
real problem that could be related to incompatibility.
Accordingly a second pair of Greater Vasas were purchased in
December 1989. These were of dissimilar size and-we were assured they
had been surgically sexed with the larger poor-feathered bird being the
male. After a prolonged period bringing them into condition they were
introduced into the aviary with our original pair on 9th April 1990.
In May 1990 the paling of the bills of all four birds showed these were
coming into breeding condition. On 18th May the original gold-ringed
female was noted to have lost feathers from under the bottom mandible.
Copulations between the smaller new bird (previously considered to be a
female!) and the original female were noted on 17th, 22nd and 23rd May.
Mating occurred with the birds sitting side by side when both male and

female showed everted bag-like cloacal swellings by which they were then
locked together. The initiation of copulation was not seen in our pair but
mating behaviour was described for his birds by K. Bowen as being &amp;quot;... the
same as in any other species except that after a little while the cock shuf-
fled on to the perch beside the hen, tails still entwined, and I truly believe
their vents were still coupled!&amp;quot;
The female was observed spending a lot of time in the nest-box from
23rd May and full copulation was not seen after that date. Inspection of
the nest-box on 25th May indicated the female was sitting on at least three
eggs. On this and subsequent inspections, if not already in the nest-box,
the female always flew straight into the box when the aviary was entered
and stubbornly remained inside when the inspection hatch was opened.
By this time the female had begun to lose feathers on her crown and the
skin in that area had turned flesh-coloured. On 28th May I watched the
female fly out of the box to be fed, at first gently then vigorously with a
strong pumping action by the new small male with which she had previ-
ously been seen to mate. At that time the small male was the only one of
the four birds to show the very swollen vent typical of males in breeding
condition. The female sang all the time she was being fed then flew into
the nest-box only to quickly emerge and then be fed by the original black-
ringed male. This male was then chased off by the new small male which
took over the feeding of the female. The fourth bird then approached these
two, making choking movements as if bringing up food which appeared to
indicate it also wanted to feed the female.
On 10th June some egg shell whs seen on the floor of the nest-box and
chick sounds heard. At least one chick had hatched after an incubation
period estimated to be around 18 days. The nest-box was checked four
days later but the female sat tight and only allowed a view of two hatched
egg shells, one unhatched egg and a chick's small foot protruding from
under the brooding female.
Because of the female's behaviour chick development could not be eas-
ily monitored. However on 17th June one chick, estimated to be a week
old or older, was clearly seen. It was noted to be about 13 - 14 cm long,
totally bald and very ugly! A week later two chicks were seen, these had
both opened their eyes and had signs of feathers appearing on their wings.
These were accompanied by two unhatched eggs. Two days later pin
feathers appeared over their bodies and they developed rapidly with flight
quills of 7 - 8 cm visible on 2nd July and appeared well feathered a month
later.
During the time the chicks were in the nest the diet was supplemented
with commercial egg food and sprouted pulses. At that time the fruit
intake increased greatly and additional apples and pears were provided.

By 17th June the female had lost all the feathers from the crown,
around her eyes and on her throat. These areas were now coloured bright
ochre yellow and the skin around her throat formed a conspicuous loose
pouch. No head feather loss was noted on the males but the new small
male that had been observed copulating with the female had developed a
small pouch of naked pale skin below its lower mandible. This was not
always visible and appeared either as ivory or yellow on different occa-
sions.
The breeding female remained dominant over the three other birds in
the aviary; chasing them, singing loudly and demanding to be fed. The sit-
ting female was always fed in the aviary by the males and they never
attempted to feed her inside or close to the nest box. The breeding female
was clearly dominant over the other birds in the aviary and vigorously
chased them singing and demanding to be fed. The new, smaller male was
dominant over the original male and the larger newcomer was at the bot-
tom of the social hierarchy.
On 21st June I took the opportunity to make notes on behaviour over a
30 minute period. On emerging from the nest-box the breeding female
sang loudly then first approached the black-ringed male which fed and
mounted her four times in the first five minutes of observation. The black-
ringed male perched beside the female and vigorously pushed food into
her upturned open bill. He then stepped onto her flattened back, balancing
by pushing his closed bill so that it fitted snugly into her nape. Any cloacal
contact was brief and this mounting differed from full copulation during
which our parrots had been observed to have their cloacas locked together.
The new male which had a month previously been seen in full copula-
tion with the female, perched only a metre away calling persistently. He
then approached the female but was chased off by her before she returned
to the black-ring male to be fed and mounted a further three times in quick
succession. She then displayed with her wings drooped to the ground and
her tail fanned and pointed skywards before chasing off both new Vasas
and returning again to the black-ring male, which by now appeared to
have no food left to offer.
Finding no food available for her favours she then chased the new
small male around the aviary until he fed her, giving the black-ring male a
chance to return to the food dish. Suitably gorged the black-ring male
returned to the perch where it had previously fed the female. At that point
the female transferred her attentions back to him and he again fed and
mounted her nine times in a period of five minutes, alternating mountings
with feeding bouts.
A strange, slow motion neck-snaking display by both birds then began
in which the birds moved their heads in such a way that the female's head

was first to one side and then on the other side of the male's. This was fol-
lowed by the male feeding the female then mounting her whilst still feed-
ing her. A second bout of neck-snaking was then initiated by the female
and copied by the male before she again demanded feeding. The male
appeared to have again exhausted his ability to satisfy this female and she
turned her attentions back to the new small male which again fed her then
also briefly mounted her.
If one was allowed to be anthropomorphic this demanding mother
appeared to be aggressively pursuing both males, demanding food and
then reinforcing this by allowing them to mount her. After 25 minutes of
this and a final bout of unsuccessfully demanding more food from the two
chosen males, she flew to the nest-box from where the small squeaky calls
of chicks were then heard.
Both males then took the opportunity to fly to the food and appeared to
be selecting apples, which could easily and quickly be consumed.
Although both active males fed separately no aggression was obvious
between them, or between them and the fourth bird which had been
excluded from this half-hour &amp;quot;soap opera&amp;quot;.
On 22nd June that fourth bird was chased vigorously by the breeding
female. The fourth bird appeared not to be in as good breeding condition
as the other Vasas and had a greyer cast to its feathers. Perhaps because of
this, but we suspected at the time perhaps because it was a female, it was
attacked by the breeding female and on the following day had to be
removed from the aviary. On later sexing that bird proved to be a male.
For the greater part of the breeding cycle our group had then comprised
one female and three males.
The first chick fledged on the morning of 29th July and the second that
same afternoon. One of the chicks returned to the nest to roost that
evening and over the next few days often only one chick was seen in the
aviary. The young appeared identical to the adults but could be distin-
guished by the pale grey bare skin around their eyes and their very clean,
white bills tinged pale pink. At that time the bills of the adults had begun
to turn back to their darker, non-breeding colour.
The female continued feeding the chicks over the next few weeks and
was very protective of them, chasing the males away if they ventured near.
She still demanded food from the males but less frequently than when the
chicks were in the box. By 8th August the yellow colour of the bare skin
on her head had faded considerably and one or two pin feathers had begun
to regrow. A week later her crown was like a pin-cushion covered in small
pin feathers but although remaining dominant over the males, singing
loudly as she occasionally chased them round the aviary, she was less con-
cerned about them approaching the chicks. However, on no occasion were

the males seen to feed the chicks either inside or outside the nest. That was
the sole prerogative of the female who during that period was fed exclu-
sively by the males and was never seen to attempt to feed herself.
Rosemary Low, in a recent article in the Avicultural Magazine , briefly
mentioned the propensity of Vasa Parrots to assume exaggerated attitudes
when sun-bathing. During the period when this nesting was occurring the
two males were often seen sun-bathing together, stretched out on the floor
against the back stone wall of their aviary. Although their legs were often
fully extended outwards and they lay on their sides, their attitudes were
not so exaggerated as those assumed by the breeding female.
So strange were her postures that on several occasions we were alerted
by visiting members of the public that a sick or dying parrot had been seen
on the floor of the aviary. The most extreme posture even had me wonder-
ing about the bird's health when I saw her laid on her side with her lower
wing stretched out backwards at a most awkward agle and her upper wing
stretched out forwards. Her head was thrown back, her eyes closed or half-
closed and her bill open whilst the bare skin on the throat of this bald par-
rot fluttered. Explaining to a layman that she was perfectly alright, just
sunbathing and the baldness was normal during the breeding cycle and not
a consequence of aggression was not easy. One visitor retorted: "It still
looks sick to me".
Such is the fascination of Vasa Parrots, and not only sunbathing but
also bathing in water is much enjoyed and again, some interesting poses
are struck, including one in which the wings are stretched forward like a
swimmer about to dive in the pool.
On one occasion I also watched the female playfully laying on her back
with her feet in the air. My observations were too brief to then ascertain
whether she was dust-bathing or just behaving in a playful fashion, closely
watched by the Kea in the adjacent enclosure. To anyone who might still
consider Vasa Parrots to be rather dull then I can only recommend that
they keep and study them for they really are the most fascinating parrots.

THE CAPTIVE BREEDING OF BLUE-BACKED FAIRY
BLUEBIRDS IRENA PUELLA AT THE SAN DIEGO
ZOO, CALIFORNIA, USA
By: Lorayne Haye

(Sr. Keeper, Bird Department)
The Blue-backed Fairy Bluebird Irena puella is a medium-sized passed
ne in the family Irenidae. It ranges throughout Southeast Asia and the
Philippine Islands inhabiting densely forested areas where it can easily
hide, being very shy and elusive by nature. The diet in the wild consists
mostly of fruit such as guavas, berries and figs in addition to insects. The
nest is constructed of small twigs and leaves neatly woven into a small cup
which can hold between two to four eggs.
The first captive breeding occurred in the Edward Marshall Boehm
Aviaries, Trenton, New Jersey, USA in 1963, reported by Everitt (1964).
The second was at Keston Bird Park, England in 1965 (Pickett, pers.
comm.).
The San Diego Zoo first exhibited a pair of Blue-backed Fairy
Bluebirds in 1977. These birds were confiscated from a shipment that
came out of the Philippines and were later purchased from the United
States Customs auction.
In 1979, this pair went to nest and fledged two chicks. In 1986, this
original pair of Fairy Bluebirds was moved to a 20 ft. x 15 ft. x 7ft (7m x 4
.57 x 2.13m) aviary. The aviary was abundantly planted with Sword Ferns
Nephrolepsis exalta , Tubadanthus Tupidanthus calyptratus, Golden
Bamboo Phyllostachys aurea , Banana Musa sp., Staghorn Fern
Platycerium sp., Cotoneaster, Splitleaf Philodendron Monstera sp. and
annual rye grass Lolium multiflorum.
Also inhabiting this enclosure was a pair of Malayan Argus Pheasants
Argusianus a. argus, a pair of Golden-Fronted Leaf-birds Chloropsis
aurifrons, a pair of Roul-Roul Partridge Rollulus roulroul, and a White-
rumped Shama Copsychus malabaricus. Aggression was never a problem
amongst these species, even during breeding season.
These birds were given a soft food pan that consisted of chopped
apples, bananas, papaya, oranges, raisins and blueberries. The diet also
included Bird-of-Prey Zoopreem (Central Nebraska Packing Inc.), soaked
small dog kibble (Ralston Eurina Co.), mealworms and various vitamin
supplements. A "pheasant pan" was also provided, which consisted of Dr.
Tom's pheasant pellets (Zeigler Bros. Inc.), oystershell, a few peanuts,
chopped spinach, carrots, apple and mealworms and was placed on the
ground for the Argus Pheasants and Roul-Roul Partridges.
On 22nd April 1986 a round bamboo nest basket 10 in. x 8 in. (25.4 x
20.32 cm) was placed in a secluded part of the aviary in a corner and

wired in place, approximately 5ft (1.52 m) from the ground. The bottom of
the basket was lined with straw and a small handful of pine needles was
spread on top. Additional pine needles were scattered throughout the
aviary on the ground. Immediately after the nest was put into the enclo-
sure, the female flew to the ground and began stacking pine needles in her
beak. When the nest was completed, there was a smooth blanket of pine
needles and leaves woven neatly into the shape of a cup within the bam-
boo basket. Courtship in the form of harmonious vocalizations, and allo-
preening was observed. However, copulation was never witnessed.
On 27th April, five days after the nest basket had been put into the
enclosure, the female laid her first egg. The egg was light blue in colour
and heavily spotted with brown on the large end of the egg. On 29th April,
the second egg was laid and incubation commenced. The female was sole-
ly in charge of the incubation duties. The incubation period lasted fourteen
days, during which the male stayed on the opposite side of the aviary.
Both the male and the female could be heard vocalizing throughout the
day.
On 13th May, during early morning rounds, the female was stacking
mealworms in her beak and darting back to the nest. Upon checking the
nest, only one chick was there. The fate of the other egg or chick was
never kncwn. During this time, mealworms were given four to five times
per day. The standard soft food pan was given but the contents were dou-
bled. The female was the only one observed feeding the chick and the
male again kept his distance.
On 23rd May, eleven days after hatch the chick fledged. Plumage was a
dull verditer blue. The bird completely lacked a tail, had scant primaries
and grey down upon its chest. The flight exhibited was so ungainly that for
the first four to five days it hopped from branch to branch rather than try-
ing to fly. The female was attentive in her feeding duties. She was
observed feeding the chick worms, Zoopreem, the assorted fruit mixture
and the soaked dog kibble. Feeding by means of regurgitation was never
observed.
By 11th June (19 days after fledge), the chick had started to develop a
darker blue colour and the eye had begun to change to a red colour, as in
the adults. By this time, the young bird had also started to take on the
shape of an adult, with the primary and tail feathers present.
On 19th June, 1986, 28 days after the first chick fledged, the female
laid her first egg of the second clutch. The second egg was laid the follow-
ing day and incubation commenced. At this time, the chick from the first
clutch had begun to feed itself. However, when one of the adults would
land nearby, the first juvenile would exhibit frantic begging behaviour.
This begging behaviour was quickly ignored as on 4th July the second

clutch hatched, and the parents had no time to feed the begging chick.
There were now two new chicks and for the first time the male was
observed participating in the feeding duties. The hatchlings had such vora-
cious appetites that the parents would stack their beaks with mealworms
and together fly to the nest. This continued for five to ten minutes approxi-
mately every two hours for the first seven days after hatch. The seventh
day seemed to be the most demanding for the chicks' feeding regime. This
was probably due to the onset of fledging. On the 8th to 10th day, their
appetites dropped as I observed the parents&amp;apos; feeding schedule was cut by
about half. On the 11th day after hatch, both chicks had fledged and were
observed perching in the trees, upon early morning rounds. At this point, I
had noticed aggression between the male and the fledgling from the first
clutch. It was decided to transfer the young bird to another enclosure. This
pair went on to successfully rear yet a third clutch in the 1986 breeding
season, bringing the total number of young reared to four. All the afore-
mentioned clutches had the same incubation period of 14 days. Hatch to
fledge was 11 days.
Conclusion
The Blue-backed Fairy Bluebird is a beautiful addition to any collec-
tion, be it a zoological facility or for the private aviculturist. I believe that
given the right environment and necessary food items, it will breed quite
readily in captivity.

BREEDING THE MEALY AMAZON PARROT
AMAZON A FARINOSA FARINOSA
(BODDAERT) AT OBERHAUSEN ORNITHOLOGICAL
INSTITUTE, WEST GERMANY
By: Wemer Lantermann

<bodyText confidence="0.976457388888889" page_id="58075283"  page_num="126" year="" vol="">
Introduction
Until 1980, when Rosemary Low&amp;apos;s book &amp;quot; Parrots - their Care and
Breeding&amp;quot; was published, there was very little known about Mealy
Amazons. They were rarely kept in captivity and no breeding success
had been recorded. After 1980 the situation changed because more Mealy
Amazons were imported to Europe. Nowadays, these parrots can be found
in many parrot collections, bird parks and specialized zoological gardens.
Nevertheless breeding successes are still a great rarity.
A Mealy Amazon of the nomiate race was successfully reared in the
Oberhausen Omithclogical Institute (Institut fur Papageienforschung, IPF,
Oberhausen) and this success will be described in this article.
Grouping, care and management of the adult birds
Between 1981 and 1986, the Institute acquired five adult Mealy
Amazons of the nominate race from private owners, who had difficulties
in keeping their parrots. A sixth bird was supplemented as a loan from
Oberhausen Animal Park. The parrots were housed two by two in separate
indoor/outdoor aviaries, according to their "sympathy" relationship.
Unfortunately, the parrots later were defined by laparoscopy as five males
and only one female. So there was only one pair and two &amp;quot;male pairs&amp;quot; in
the Institute. The varying of the dominance relationsship of one of these
&amp;quot;male pairs&amp;quot; is already described ana discussed by Lantermann &amp;
Wildschrei (in press).
The second "male pair" became more and more aggressive with the
start of the breeding season and behaved like a real pair, with one bird
showing dominance and one showing submissiveness (see Lantermann
1990, in press).
The parrots of the third pair were unmistakable with regard to plumage
and body, and differed only slightly with regard to their weight although
they exhibited strong morphological differences. The weight of the male
was 660 g, the female's 635 g.
In 1987, this pair was obviously interested in the nest-box, but the
female did not start laying in that year. In 1988, the birds had two non-fer-
tile eggs in April, which were followed by a second unfertilized clutch in
June. The eggs could not be found when examining the nest-box in
August; it was not possible to find out whether they had been eaten by the
birds or crushed and buried.

The care and nourishment of Amazons at the IPF has been reported
several times by Lantermann (1987, 1988, 1989 in press) and therefore
will not be repeated here. Over the years, the food had been adapted to the
international knowledge of nourishment physiology (Aeckerlein, 1986).
The share of fruit, vegetables and boiled legumes is about 50 % of the
general food in the breeding season and while rearing the young birds.
Rearing a Mealy Amazon in 1989
In the spring of 1989 the Amazons got a new nest-box, which was
filled with a 10 cm layer of wooden chips. Early in this year there were
some non-fertile eggs again, which vanished until May. A following clutch
was noticed on 3rd June which had probably been laid on around 21st
May (with regard to the 27 day-breeding time in Burkart&amp;apos;s Amazona fari-
nosa guatemalae&amp;apos;, see Burkart, 1985), because on 17th June the first beg-
ging sounds of a young bird could be heard.
Because of the aggressiveness of the adult parrots at this time, the first
opportunity to look at the young Amazon was not until 29th July. The
chick was about six weeks old at that time and had gone through the

greater part of its development by then. Its eyes were open and a first
showing of its feathers on the belly and back could be seen. The tips of the
feathers of the wing were already some millimeters in length. Its beak was
a light horn colour with a dark tip on the upper mandible.
Especially striking were the strong legs and feet which seemed a little
out of proportion to the rest of the body. When, trying to take the bird oul
for a photograph, it showed itself quite strong and was difficult to restrain.
It struck a lot with its wings to keep its balance on the smooth surface
When taking the bird back to its parents, it showed no damage from this
incident.
A second investigation was made on 11th August. At this time, the
young Amazon was fully fledged and the feathers of the tail were aboul
25-30 millimeters in length.
On 12th August, the bird made its first attempt to leave the nest-bo&amp;gt;
with the help of its beak.
At a further check on 20th August.,the feathers of the tail were alsc
developed to full length.
On the morning of 26th August, 70 days after hatching, the young birc
left its nest-box.
It seemed to be quite awkward and tried to get a hold on the steel bar:
of the cage and on the perch. It was smaller than its parents and it:
plumage was duller. Like the parents it had some little yellow feathers or
the crown. Its eyes were dark: the pupil black, the iris dark brown and ir
an outer circle, light brown. In contrast to the adult parrots its uppe
mandible was very broad.
The parent birds carefully guarded the young bird with the female sit
ting next to it in the nest-box and the male joining them at every hint o
danger in the surroundings of the aviary. When visitors approached th
cage, the adult parrots disappeared in the nest-box and were not seen for
long time afterwards.
When the young Amazon was taken out of the cage on 26th August fo
further photographs, it reacted rather aggressively, and tried to bite and t&lt;
flee. It uttered some growling sounds which increased with its rising feai
The parents were lured to the front of the cage by those sounds and starts
to cry loudly and to show aggressive tendencies. When the young parrc
got back into the cage, the parents showed aggression towards the youn
Amazon by striking its head and beak with their beak.
Conclusion
This rearing of a Mealy Amazon, which seems to be the first of th
nominate race in Western Germany, is the sixth Amazon species to b
reared within eight years in the IPF Oberhausen.
Looking at the chronological sequence, in 1982 there was the fin

SUCCESSFUL PROPAGATION OF NICOBAR PIGEONS,
CALOENAS N. NICOBARICA USING HOMING PIGEONS
AS SURROGATE PARENTS

The pair of Nicobar Pigeons Caloenas n. nicobarica at the Cincinnati Zoo
and Botanical Gardens repeatedly failed in nesting attempts and
attempts to rear young. With the use of homing pigeons as surrogate par-
ents we had hoped to be able to give the Nicobar squabs an initial, healthy
start before attempting any hand-rearing. The incubation procedure using
two sets of surrogate parents was implemented and proved successful.
Whether the squabs were to be left under the care of their foster parents
also had to be determined. Sufficient time under their care was needed to
assure survival. Due to size differentials and possible rejection more than
the minimum weeks would also prove undesirable. Two squabs were pro-
duced using this procedure.
The Nicobar Pigeon, with its elongated neck feathers and iridescent
green plumage, is a spectacular member of the order Columbiformes. Its
natural diet consists of seeds, fruit, plus some invertebrates. Nesting
occurs 3 - 10m above the ground in colonies numbering up to several
thousand birds (Goodwin, 1983). In 1979, the Nicobar was listed under
Appendix I by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Other sources report the
Nicobar is almost extinct in parts of its home range of Indo-Australasia,
(Maruska, 1987).
While several institutions have bred this pigeon well in captivity, hand-
rearing techniques have been developed due to the rejection of eggs by
certain birds. Artificial incubation at a temperature of 37.2*C and a wet
bulb of 29.4*C was used. An artificial diet of Borden Esbilac with small
quantities of Gerber High Protein baby cereal and Vi-Penta multivitamin
drops was fed replacing the cereal with monkey chow at three weeks old.
(Bell 1981).
The Cincinnati Zoo received a six-month old male Nicobar Pigeon in
March, 1976. A four-month old female was obtained in October, 1983.
The pair was set up in an exhibit measuring 2m x 1.8m x 3m high. The
cage utilised sets of large skylights augmented with dual 40w Vitalights.
A diet of premix pigeon seed, dried fruit, hard-boiled egg along with a
mix of soaked dog show, peanut butter and cottage cheese was offered
throughout the day. Only the dry seed mix was available ad lib. Vitamin
supplements in the form of Necton-S, Necton-Bio and Neo-Calglucon
(during peak egg production) were added to the fruit mix.

No breeding activity occured until 1986. Aggression from a pair of
Tawny Frogmouths, Podargus strigoides plumiferus inhibited any
courtship or nesting behaviours. Several weeks after the Frogmouth's
removal, courtship behaviour was observed. The male began to parade
around the female repeatedly, calling and displaying his ornamental neck
plumage. Both birds began to break off branches of the exhibit's plantings,
consisting mainly of arbicolas, then transporting them to a nest-box locat-
ed in the upper corner of their display. The nest-box, constructed of ply-
wood, measured 30cm square. The front of the box was open and had a
4cm lip to hold the contents of the nest.
On March 9, 1986, the first egg laid by the pair was found broken. Two
more broken eggs and an expired three-day old squab were found through-
out that year. In 1987 the problem persisted with more broken eggs until
the decision to pull any further eggs was made.
Artificial incubation was attempted as was the hand-rearing technique
described by Bell. The squab died after three days.
8th May, 1987: an egg found was removed and placed under a pair of
homing pigeons. Approximately ten days before the Nicobar egg was
expected, the homing pigeons were allowed to nest. When the Nicobar egg
was laid, the homing pigeons also had one egg. The two eggs were then
switched. The incubation of a homing pigeon egg is 17 days (Carter),
much less than the 28 days required by the artificially incubated Nicobar
egg. Fifteen days into the incubation the egg was moved under another
pair of homing pigeons and hatched on 5th June. To ensure survival
through the first few critical days, the squab remained with the surrogate
parents until 10th June. The squab's morning weight on the following day
was 39 grams. Three feeds a day of 5cc per feed began and increased in
volume with the growth of the squab. The formula consisted of 1 part
Esbilac, 1 part Beech-Nut Stage 1 rice cereal and 3 parts water. The squab
grew rapidly and was on its own within two months of hatching. Another
egg was placed under the surrogate parents on the 17th July. The egg
hatched on 12th August, 1987 and remained with the surrogate parents for
12 days. The second squab weighed 78 grams, 14 grams less then the first
squab at the same age. At two months old the second squab fledged and
was eating without assistance.
Successful propagation of Nicobar Pigeons through the use of homing
pigeons as surrogate parents was accomplished. Several pairs of surrogate
parents are necessary so the entire incubation period of the egg is provided
for. The optimum time the squab is left under the surrogate parents is cru-
cial. Three to four days under the surrogate parents is necessary to pass the
first critical stage. The squab should be taken before 10 days old so that a
slowed rate of growth is not seen, as shown by the second squab.

When dealing with an endangered species, new procedures must be
provided to insure its successful propagation. Whether this pair of Nicobar
Pigeons proved unsuccessful, due to the lack of a colonial setting or due to
individual idiosyncrasies, is not known. What is known is that surrogate
parenting, in cooperation with hand-rearing, has proved to be a viable
route by which to insure the success of propagating this species in captivi-

Introduction
The Great Indian Bustard Choriotis nigriceps (Aves: Fam. Otididae)

once had a wide distribution and was present in the Indian subcontinent in
most of the short-grass plains. At present owing to habitat destruction and
hunting, the Bustard is an endangered species and listed in Schedule I of
the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972. It is extremely rare in
Pakistan (P. D. Goriup, pers. comm.) and in India is present in only six
states, with a total population of about 2,000 birds (Rahmani and
Manakadan, 1985; 1988: Rahmani, 1987; 1989).
Growth and development of the Bustard chick is not fully known since
(i) it is very difficult to study in the wild, and (ii) this species has not been
succesfully bred in captivity. Bustards are bred in captivity. Out of 22
species in the world, only a few have bred in cages, for instance the
Australian Bustard Choriotis australis (White, 1985), the Little Black
Bustard Afrotis atra (Gregson, 1986), the Houbara Bustard Chlamydotus
undulata (Phillipe Goucher, pers. comm.), the Great Bustard Otis tarda
(Osborne, 1985) and Buff-crested Lophotis ruficrista, White-bellied
Eupodotis senegalensis and Kori Choriotis kori bustards (P. D. Goriup,
pers. comm.)
Regarding the Great Indian Bustard, the Jodhpur Zoo in Rajastan State
of India had success in rearing chicks caught from the wild, but no data
has been published about their growth, food and behaviour. During our
studies on the Great Indian Bustard (see Rahmani 1987; 1989: Manakadan
and Rahmani, 1989) at Rollapadu in Andhra Pradesh state of India, we
reared and kept records of a Bustard chick picked up by a villager, who
found it in his crop field. We reared the chick from an estimated age of 20
days to 429 days, after which it was killed by some vandals. A record of
its weight and height increase and other developments was kept. Weight
was recorded until 382 days by a commercial double pan balance nearest
to 1 g. After that, as the bird became too big and would struggle on the
pan, a spring balance with 100 g graduations was used. The bird was sus-
pended by a cradle-like structure with openings for the legs while being
weighed. Measurement of height was difficult, and not very exact, due to
the various postures the bird took.

Captive Environment and Diet
Initially, the chick was kept in a 2x1 m chicken-coop type cage situated
at the border of the Bustard area of Rollapadu. As the chick grew, it devel-
oped a habit of poking its bill through the mesh and injuring its bill and
forehead, so it was transferred to a 5x4x2.5 m cage. This larger cage size
somehow stopped its bill-probing activities. The cage had a floor covered
with sand and was well exposed to sunlight except for some shade at a
corner and a solitary bush. During mornings and evenings, the bird which
became tame soon, was taken out for walks for exercise.
The food given was based on a trial and error method and from the
information received from the Jodhpur Zoo. At Jodhpur Zoo, the Bustard
was fed on a diet of wheat &amp;apos;chappaties&amp;apos; (unleavened bread), greens, goat's
liver and sometimes the chicks of the domestic fowl. At Rollapadu, the
chick readily took to boiled eggs (sometime eating bits of the egg shell)
and would eat nothing else, except insects. It regularly ate grit especially
until six months old. It was fed twice a day i.e. in the mornings and
evenings and during each feed it received about 30 to 50 grasshoppers. As
it grew up, it needed more and more eggs, up to five eggs per day, but
when it started accepting sorghum Sorghum vulgare 'chappaties' at about
220 days, the number of eggs went down. Around this time, it also started

of our observations were:
1. Initially the chick fed bill to bill (food had to be directed to its bill).
Gradually in stages, it was able to take food placed on the ground and only
when about 200 days old was it able to catch prey on its own.
2. It knew how to handle prey. While it swallowed whole grasshoppers,

stinging insects such as bees and wasps were killed and crushed at the tip
of the bill before swallowing. At about 300 days old, it encountered a
scorpion and killed it by repeated jabs with the bill, and pecked and broke
the sting before swallowing it. It clumsily broke its first egg

Acorypha is the most abundant grasshopper in protected grasslands, while
Crotogonus is the most common grasshopper in grazing lands. We do not
know the reason for this change in the preference of grasshopper species.

4. At 20 days, it had fear of potential predators such as harriers, crows and
dogs. At about 60 days, it lost fear of harriers and crows, but even after a
year old, retained its fear of large birds of prey.
5. At about 65 days, it was able to fly short distances but only after about
210 days old was it capable of good flight.
6. It had a low, moaning contact call, which it retained until about a year
old.
7. It took dust baths regularly, first observed when 45 days old.
8. At about 50 days it was possible to sex the chick. It resembled a male
with its comparatively thicker neck, dimensionally bigger head and throat,
prominent black crest and erect walk (unlike the small bent, crouched
walk of hens). By 100 days, there was no doubt about its sex, the distin-
guishing characters being more pronounced.
9. At 260 days, which coincided with the Bustard breeding season, this
Bustard produced grr-grr&amp;apos; calls on a few occasions of very short duration
when the booming calls of other displaying cocks were audible. In March,
and at about 400 days old, coinciding with the second breeding season of
the Bustard, it indulged in 1-5 minute displays early in the mornings,
immediately on awakening. Displays consisted of cocked tail feathers,
lowered wings and some foot movements. It emitted &amp;apos;gkroo-gkroo&amp;apos; calls,

during which the bill was pushed upwards at about an angle of 45*. There
was no throat-puffing or any sign of a gular pouch as in adults. At the
time, the bird stood 96 cm tall and weighed 6.7 kg, while adult cocks can
reach 14 kg and stand more than a metre.

Courtship in many estrildid finches consists of holding a grass stem or
feather by one end, and then bobbing the body rhythmically up and down
by alternately stretching and bending the legs (the "inverted curtsey" of
Morris, 1958). This is often referred to as the "straw display" and as evi-
denced by its frequent occurrence in all three tribes is probably phyloge-
netically "the oldest form of courtship&amp;quot; in estrildids (Goodwin, 1982:40).
This display is lost altogether in some taxa, e.g. the Bicheno Finch
Poephila bichenovii (Morris, 1958; Immelmann, 1982). However, a
Bicheno Finch in our collection regularly performs the straw display. This
has prompted us to bring together our observations and those of others
indicating that certain individuals belonging to species that normally do
not perform the straw display will on rare occasions perform the ritual.
Moreover, different species differ in the number of components of the
straw display that have been retained or lost. These data are of interest to
students of evolutionary biology as they demonstrate how natural selection
may operate in modifying dispositions to express behaviour patterns.
Variation in the straw display
The full straw display includes at least five different elements (Table 1),
all of which are included in the displays of the African Silverbill
Lonchura cantans and Indian Silverbill L. malabarica. In the introductory
portion of this display, the displaying silverbill grasps the straw by one
end, sleeks all its feathers, holds its body erect with its tail pointed straight
down, then jerks its head up and down several times. Each jerk lasts about
a second, and two or three seconds elapse between jerks. The head is
jerked above the horizontal and then returns back to the horizontal or
almost horizontal position (fig. 1A). The displayer is silent at this time.
This movement is reminiscent of that observed when an estrildid is shap-
ing the roof of the domed nest. This component of the display is probably
derived from nest-building movements.
In the next portion of the display, the performer may lean forward so
that its body is now at an oblique angle with the horizontal. The tail is now
twisted towards the displayee, and the belly feathers may be fluffed to give
it a "pot-belly" effect. It now performs inverted curtsies accompanied with
song (fig. IB). The straw may be dropped in the middle of the singing per-
formance. The female signals readiness to copulate by quivering her tail.
The head-jerk portion does not appear to have been described in earlier

studies of silverbill displays (Kunkel, 1959; Giittinger, 1970). Morris
(1958) mentions U-shaped movements of the head performed by silver-
bills. It is not clear whether or not he is referring to the head-jerk display.
Although the head-jerk portion may be left out altogether, males of
both silverbill species regularly perform both head-jerk and inverted curt-
sies. A female L. malabarica in our collection regularly performed both
head-jerk and straw display, but unaccompanied by song. She ceased dis-
playing once she was paired with a male.
With the three cordon-bleus Uraeginthus spp., the head may be jerked
up while performing inverted curtsies, i.e. head-jerks are coupled with
inverted curtsies (Goodwin, 1965). The Star Finch Emblema ruficauda
performs the straw display with inverted curtsey. Only before copulation
does the head-jerk appear. However, only the female Red-browed Waxbill
Aegintha temporalis performs the head-jerk, in response to the male's
straw display (Immelmann, 1982). In silverbills the two movements are
performed separately, and the head-jerk may be absent altogether (this
study). Males of the Strawberry Finch (Red Munia) Amandava amandava
may hold a straw or feather, then sing and bow slowly (Goodwin, 1960;
pers. obs.). This is perhaps the homologue of the head-jerk display seen in
silverbills.
Field and laboratory observations indicate that the Bicheno Finch has
lost the straw display altogether and typically courts by fluffing its feathers
and then performing many ritual beak-wiping movements against the
perch (Morris, 1958; Immelmann, 1982). However, Mobbs (1985) report-
ed Bicheno Finches displaying on perches by bowing while holding a
straw. An adult male Bicheno Finch in our collection courts with sleeked
body feathers, tail twisted towards the displayee, a straw held by one end,
and inverted curtsies (fig. 2). Like Mobbs's (1987) birds, ours displayed in
silence. Unlike Mobbs's, however, ours performed inverted curtsies and
twisted its tail in the direction of the female.
The Painted Finch Emblema picta is another species which does not
perform the straw display (Morris, 1958; Immelmann, 1982). Courtship
consists of singing with rapid pivoting movements of the head accompa-
nied by jerky, hopping movements towards the female. However, one indi-
vidual in Webber's (1946) collection performed a full straw display,
including inverted curtsies.
The Bengalese Finch (White-backed Munia) Lonchura striata does not
perform the curtsey display (Morris, 1958; Eisner, 1957). However, on
rare occasions the male may hold a straw by one end and "fly heavily
about the cage with his breast and belly feathers raised" (Slater, 1970:315;
pers. obs.), then drop the straw and perform his courtship display which
consists predominantly of swaying movements of the body on a lateral

plane. The Spice Finch (Nutmeg Mannikin) Lonchura punctulata often
performs inverted curtsies but without a straw. Again, some individuals
may hold a straw and fly about as a preamble to the inverted curtsey
(Moynihan and Hall 1954). The straw is dropped prior to actual display-
ing. The Zebra Finch (Spotted-sided Finch) Poephila guttata and Black-
throated Finch Poephila cincta do not perform inverted curtsies. However,
some juveniles may hold a straw as a prelude to their ritualized courtship
movements (Immelmann, 1982; Sossinka, pers. comm.). This is more
often seen in the Black-throated Finch than in the Zebra Finch.
The White-breasted Mannikin (Pictorella Finch) Lonchura pectoralis
does not perform inverted curtsies, but does hold a straw during its
courtship which is performed on the ground (Immelmann, 1982). This
species has lost its song altogether, and utters two notes in its stead during
its display (Hall, 1962). Bicheno Finches also tend to display in silence
(Mobbs, 1985). Song appears to be used mostly in advertising and rarely
in courtship (Mobbs, 1986).
In some species, e.g. the Pearly-headed Mannikin (Grey-headed
Silverbill) Lonchura griseicapilla, some individuals perform full inverted
curtsies with straw, but others never (?) do (Baptista, 1973). The male
Diamond Sparrow Emhlema guttata performs the inverted curtsey display
holding a straw, then drops the straw, crouches and twists its head in the
manner of a begging fledgling (Nicolai, 1962). Two birds in our collection
never perform the straw display portion, but twist their head in the beg-

ging posture and in this position perform inverted curtsies. To our knowl-
edge this has never been described before.
Heritability of the straw display
Studies of the displays of hybrids indicate that the straw display is heri-
table. Eisner (1958) and Harrison (1962) reported on courtship behaviour
of African Silverbill x Bengalese and Bengalese x African Silverbill cross-
es and noted that the hybrids performed the inverted curtsey with straw.
Two hybrid L. cantans x L. striata that we observed also performed the
head-jerk of the silverbill, but sometimes held a straw and bowed low
almost touching the perch, the latter a preamble to the display of the
Bengalese (fig. 3A; Table 2). Additionally, although during the initial
phase of the curtsey display our hybrids held the tail closed and twisted in
the direction of the female, this soon passed on to a spread tail, character-
istic of the Bengalese (fig. 4). However, the tail was pointed down like the
silverbill and not up like a Bengalese (compare fig. IB and fig. 3B). These
observations indicate that raising and spreading of the tail are not neces-
sarily coupled and may be expressed as distinct units.
Two L. malabarica x L. striata hybrids performed full straw displays
including head-jerk, inverted curtseys and tail-twist. However, the hybrids
occasionally performed a slight nod or incomplete bow before displaying,
a characteristic of L. striata. Neither hybrid sang during the display.
The inverted curtsey is absent from the display of the Bengalese Finch
but is present in that of the Spice Finch and their FI hybrids (Table 2). In
the FI hybrids, the tail is pointed down and is not spread.

Hybrids between the African Silverbill and Zebra Finch perform the
straw display of the silverbill including head-jerk straw-holding and
inverted curtsey. However, the feather postures are more similar to those
of the Zebra Finch parent (fig. 5). The silverbill .sings or displays with
none of the feathers ruffled, although the feathers of the belly may be
fluffed to produce a "pot-belly" effect (fig. 5). The Zebra Finch displays
with nape and belly feathers ruffled (fig. 5). The hybrid African Silverbill
x Zebra Finch performs the straw display with nape, belly and lower
breast feathers ruffled. Ruffling of the lower breast feathers is present in
the displays of neither parental type.
African Silverbills perform a second display during which the body is
held almost horizontally in relation to the perch (fig. 5) and in this posture
the male sings with the head moving slowly from side to side on a hori-

zontal plane and with the bill hardly open. The Zebra Finch sings with
exaggerated opening and closing movements of the bill. The silverbill x
Zebra Finch hybrid most often sings with the closed bill of the silverbill,
but with the feather posture more similar to the Zebra Finch as in the straw
display described above.
African Silverbill x Bengalese hybrids also perform the horizontal song
display of the silverbill, but this is preceded by a deep bow similar to the
Bengalese. Again the display begins with the tail closed, but soon passes
on to a tail spread posture typical of Bengalese Finches (fig. 4) but down-
pointing like a silverbill. The belly feathers of the hybrid are sometimes
raised and ruffled as in the Bengalese.
Field observations on the courtship display of the White-bellied
Mannikin (White-headed Munia) Lonchura leucogastra have been made
in the Philippines by Ronald Krupa (pers. comm.) who noted that males
perform the straw display with inverted curtsies. Three L. striata x L.
leucogastra males bred by us performed both inverted curtsies (as in L.
leucogastra) and lateral pivoting movements of the body (as in L. striata ).
Their tails were spread but pointed down and straws were not held. One of
these hybrid males was mated to his L. leucogastra mother. The backcross
looked identical to a pure L. leucogastra , and it performed inverted curt-
sies holding a straw.
Another L. striata x L. leucogastra male was mated to a female L. stri-
ata. Two male and two female offspring were produced which looked
identical to L. striata. The two backcross males performed full Bengalese
displays including spread and raised tail, ruffled belly and nape feathers,
bowing, and lateral pivoting movements of the body. However, lateral
body pivoting was sometimes interspersed with single inverted curtsies.
Thus, although the backcrosses looked and behaved like Bengalese, the
inverted curtsey from their father's repertoire was not lost altogether, and
was expressed in a "vestigial" form.

In sum, the inverted curtsey with straw is an ancient display distributed
widely across the three tribes of estrildids (Goodwin, 1982). Our observa-
tions on the displays of various hybrids and backcrosses indicate that this
display is heritable. The fact that backcrosses to both parental forms in the
case of the L. striata x L. leucogastra experiments produced progeny
which looked and behaved like the species to which the backcross was
made is further evidence in favour of a genetic basis for the species differ-
ences in behaviour described (Franck, 1974). One to as many as four of
the five components comprising the straw display may be lost in various
species (table 1), or may be expressed on rare occasions by species which
have lost the display altogether (fig. 2). This indicates that although the

disposition to perform this display is lost in part or in its entirety in some
species, the genes controlling the expression of this display are retained
but their action is blocked in some way. Similar observations have been
made on the courtship displays of dabbling ducks (Anatini) by various
authors who also observed that behaviours rare or absent in various duck
species may be present in the displays of their hybrids. For example, many
anatid drakes perform a display called the "down-up" during which the
drake dips its bill into the water and then suddenly lifts its bill skywards,
producing a plume of water in the process. This display is absent in the
Pintail Anas acuta and South American Green-winged Teal (Chilean Teal)
A. flavirostris but appears in the courtship of their FI hybrid (von de Wall,
1963; Lorenz, 1965). Hybrids between Mallards A. platyrhynchos and
Gadwall A. strepera were backcrossed to a Mallard. The progeny perform
a display known as "bridling" which is absent in Mallard, Gadwall and
their FI hybrid (Kaltenhauser, 1971). Some authors (Lorenz, 1965;
Kaltenhauser, 1971; Manning, 1979) have suggested that during the course
of evolution behaviours are not lost but that new sets of genes cause the
raising of the threshold to perform these behaviours which are then rarely
expressed. The effects of these genes are reduced in the reorganized
genome of the FI hybrid, thus lowering the threshold and permitting the
expression of these otherwise rare behaviours.
Although the observations of the above authors may be correct, other
explanations for these phenomena are also possible. For example, it could
be that during the course of evolution modifying genes arise which block
the action of genes controlling the expression of a certain display. The
action of these genes is removed in the FI hybrid or in occasional mutants
which may regularly express an otherwise rarely observed behaviour. This
schema does not require the postulation of raised behavioural thresholds.
Another possible explanation for the loss of a display is that its expres-
sion is under polygenic control so that if during the course of evolution
one or more of the genes is lost then that display is no longer performed.
For example, we could postulate that the "down-up" display, so
widespread among anatids (Kaltenhauser, 1971), is controlled by the gene
complex "abcde". If the Pintail genome only includes "bcde" and the A.
flavirostris genome only includes "abed", then neither species will per-
form the display. If during the course of hybridization the ancestral
"abcde" complex is reconstituted, then the "down-up" display will once
more be expressed.

Evidence from displays of interspecific hybrids and backcrosses indicate
that this behaviour is heritable. It is lost in part or in its entirety in various
estrildid species, however, single individuals of species not known to per-

theories regarding the genetic basis of behaviours and their loss are dis-
cussed.

CHARACTERISTICS OF CAPTIVE-BRED HYBRID
FALCONS AS TRAINED BIRDS
</sectionHeader>

By Dr. Sterling Bunnell
(California Academy of Sciences, San Fransico, USA)
Although falconry is primarily a form of hunting sport, many of its
techniques have been adapted to the conservation and restoration of
endangered or declining species of raptors, notably the Peregrine (see, e.g.
Crdaswick, Avicultural Magazine. 91:79-92), Aplomado Falcon,
Mauritius Kestrel, Harris Hawk, White-tailed Sea Eagle, Bald Eagle,
California Condor, Eagle Owl and Elf Owl.
In the past 20 years falconers have learned how to propagate falcons in
captivity, both by natural breeding pairs and by artificial insemination.
This has made available a dependable supply of peregrines for reintroduc-
tion into the wild as well as birds for use in falconry. Other species of fal-
cons have also been propagated, and many different hybrid crosses have
been made through artificial insemination. The main purpose of these
crossings has been to produce birds with unusual hunting abilities or dis-
ease resistance. However, the accumulating experience with these hybrids
may be of interest to those concerned with avian behaviour.
The first reported instance of hybridisation of captive falcons was in
1971, in Ireland, when Ronald Stevens and John Morris placed a
Peregrine tiercel (male) and a female Saker together in a loft. The birds
mated and produced two hybrid eyases (nestlings). Since then, many
hybridisations have occured, mostly by artificial insemination, and mostly
in North America. Many of these hybrids, crosses of most of the available
falcon species, have been trained and flown as hunting birds. All types
have shown hybrid vigour, a general increase in vitality which results from

the greater array of genetic information present. Some combinations, espe-
cially the Peregrine x Prairie and Peregrine x Gyrfalcon, may be prefer-
able from the falconry standpoint to their parent species, as will be
described later.
Hybrid falcons generally have diminished fertility. Backcrosses of
Peregrine x Prairie to Peregrine have as far as I know never produced liv-
ing young, although attempted many times. However, Peregrine x Prairie
has been successfully backcrossed to Prairie on several occasions. Triple
hybridisations, in which an FI hybrid is crossed with a third species, seem
to be successful more often than backcrosses. For examples, see 16, 17,
and 18 (below).
Eggs produced by crossing Peregrine with Prairie appear to be about as
hatchable as straight Peregrine eggs produced by similar artificial insemi-
nation techniques, or perhaps slightly more so. Eggs of Peregrines crossed
with Gyr seem to have a lower rate of hatchablilty, similar to that for Gyr
crossed with Saker. Crossing Gyr with Prairie gives eggs that are reported
to have an extremely low rate of hatchablility.
Many hybrids have abnormalities of the female reproductive tract, such
as incomplete development of the oviduct. Whereas the left oviduct is nor-
mally the functional one in birds, the functional oviduct was found on the
right in one hybrid. Very few female hybrids have produced eggs although
most males produce sperm. An exception is the peregrinus x pelegrinoide s
hybridisation, in which the FIs of both sexes are normally fertile.
Individual hybrids from a variety of crosses may show elongation of
the body, legs and wings. Also common is an accelerated moult pattern, in
which several pairs of flight feathers, especially in the tail, drop out simul-
taneously. Appetite may be greater than in either parent species. A few
individual hybrids have shown various midline anomalies, such as asym-
metries in coloration, wing size, bill shape, tail shape, or a patch of breast
feathers on the dorsal midline.
Behavioural characteristics of hybrid falcons show dominance, sup-
pression, facilitation, or mixing of various parts of parental programme.
There is also the possibility of characteristics latent in a parent species
being released in the hybrid progeny due to inactivation of a normal sup-
pression mechanism. Hybrids often seem to relate to human beings more
readily than the parent species do, perhaps in compensation for the ambi-
guity of the hybrids' innate programming.
In the following descriptions the custom of listing the species of the
male parent first has been dispensed with since the data for many types
includes progeny from both possible cases i.e. male x female and female x
male. Also, parentheses are placed around the description of a hybrid
when it is crossed with a third species.

The crosses I have observed as trained birds or have received reports
about are:
1) peregrinus x mexicanus (Peregrine x Prairie). This is the most fre-
quently produced hybrid. The Prairie lays eggs in captivity more readily
than other large North American falcons. Breeders with egg-laying
Prairies will often try to upgrade the progeny by inseminating with
Peregrine sperm. The Pregrine x Prairie is probably the most generally
useful hybrid as a trained falcon. Peregrine behaviour is dominant. For
example, these hybrids are easily trained, wait on (circle overhead) at
great heights, stoop very dramatically and effectively, and have an innate
understanding of waterfowl which is brought out by experience. The main
Prairie characteristic is a willingness to attack large quarry on the ground
and kill it in a rough-and-tumble. They will sometimes bind (hold on) to
ducks and go right into the water with them. They also seem to be inten-
tional and premeditated in their hunting, like the prairie, rather than oppor-
tunistic, like the Peregrine. In straightaway speed I think they are faster
than either Peregrine or Prairie reared in similar conditions (wild-caught
birds have greater maximum speed than eyases), but not as fast as the Gyr
or Gyr hybrids.
The Peregrine x Prairie as a first-year bird is coloured almost indistin-
guishably from an immature Peregrine. The adult plumage is a combina-
tion of the parent species&amp;apos; characteristics. The full Peregrine mask is lack-
ing, but the dark line through the eye is heavier than a Prairie's. The nape
is reddish. The back is bluish after the moult, but becomes browner with
weathering. The background breast colour is buffy, and the markings are
darker and denser than the Prairie's but without the Peregrine's barring
except for a little on the flanks. In the adult tiercels the body coloration is
more Peregrine-like than in the females.
The beak is quite long and prominent and tends to grow rapidly. It
splits easily and requires frequent coping. The head is broad at the back
like a Prairie and narrow in front like a Peregrine, requiring different hood
patterns than either parent species. The foot is large like a Peregrine's but
the toes are not quite so long.
The predominance of Peregrine behaviour contributes to the usefulness
of this cross for falconry purposes. They will wait on as long, high and
well as Peregrines and can be brought to field excellence within their first
year with enough experience. Their hunting drive appears to be stronger
than a Peregrine's and they will readily attack a ground quarry, which may
occasionally interrupt a promising waiting-on flight. Their appetite is
greater than a Peregrine's and much greater than a Prairie's.
The flying style of the Peregrine x Prairie hybrid resembles that of the
parental race of Peregrine. The Peale's x Prairie has the powerful wingbeat

and boldness of the Peale's, and the tundrius-Prairie hybrids have the aeri-
al tendencies and agility of the tundrius race. The slow, cruising wingbeat
of the Rocky Mountain anatum Peregrines is also seen in their hybrids
with Prairies.
2) peregrinus x pelegrinoides Peregrine x Shahin). Shahin behaviour
predominates and coloration is intermediate. These hybrids have the rapid,
continuous wingbeat and preference for fast horizontal tailchase which
characterize the Shahin. They are less prone to wait on at a great height
than a Peregrine would be. The adult plumage tends toward the buffy
unmarked breast of the Shahin, with a few Peregrine markings present.
The Peregrine mask is usually present to an intermediate degree. Size is
closer to the Peregrine than the Shahin. Some individuals are extremely
broad and powerful in the chest and weigh much more than their size sug-
gests.
3) peregrinus x rusticolus (Peregrine x Gyrfalcon). These are the most
spectacular fliers of the hybrid falcons. Size is intermediate between the
parent species. Gyr personality (playful, friendly, intelligent) and col-
oration prevail, but they will often wait on like a Peregrine, reaching great
heights. They mature slowly in behaviour, as Gyrs do. The Peregrine
behaviour tends to emerge with maturity and experience. The speed of
flight is equal to that of a Gyr (up to 50% faster than a Peregrine) plus
they have the Peregrine's agility. They are thus able to catch strong-flying
pigeons, which are too manouverable for Gyrs to catch regularly. They can
mount rapidly and directly like a Gyr, and have the Gyrfalcon's twisting,
vertical power stoop. This hybrid is probably the best falcon for the vari-
ous speedy species of western grouse (Sage, Sharptailed, and Prairie
Chickens). They are resistant to aspergillosis, frounce and bumblefoot, to
all of which Gyrs are very susceptible.
A peregrinus x rusticolus hybrid has been backcrossed to a Tundra
Peregrine. The offspring is flying like a Peregrine even as a young bird
just out of tame hack.
4) pelegrinoides x rusticolus (Shahin x Gyrfalcon). One individual, a
tiercel, is relatively small, with Gyr colouration (white) predominating in
the adult plumage, and a beautiful light coral hue with very faint markings
in his first year. His flying style is like a Shahin, especially the tendency to
go off a considerable distance before gaining pitch and coming back. He
can also climb directly up on his tail to a height when in pursuit, like a
Gyr. He is an extremely active and dashing flier. Although he has taken a
few ducks, he clearly prefers small birds.
5) rusticolus x mexicanus (Gyrfalcon x Prairie). This cross, although
almost as fast as a Gyr, presents some difficulties as a falconry bird, Gyr
and Prairie programs are equally matched and since neither predominates

in most individuals, behaviour can be erratic from day to day. They can
use a great variety of hunting strategies and it is difficult to make them
consistently follow one style of flight. Like Gyrs they tend to choose dif-
ferent strategies to fit different terrains. They are prone to irascible temper
outbursts when imposed upon. They have the Prairie's hardiness and resis-
tance to disease. In most individuals the Prairie colouration predominates,
but some individuals are coloured like the parental phase of Gyr.
6) rusticolus x cherrug (Gyrfalcon x Saker). These birds are extremely
graceful and well formed in bodily contour, more so to this observer than
either parent species. The Gyr colour, dark or light, clearly predominates.
Some of the dark ones are almost completely black to an extent not seen
even in dark phase Gyrs. The head form resembles that of a Saker. They
are not as fast as a Gyr but much faster than a Saker. Their hunting drive
appears to be remarkably strong and they will attack quite large quarry.

<listItem confidence="0.897517571428571" page_id="58075315"  page_num="158" year="" vol="">
7) peregrinus x cherrug (Peregrine x Saker). The Peregrine colouration
is dominant in the first year. Most individuals have a very long and slender
body build, more so than a Saker. They wait on well like a Peregrine and
learn rapidly like a Saker.
8) peregrinus x biarmicus (Peregrine x Lanner). I know of only one
individual produced in France. This bird was faster than a Lanner,
approaching Peregrine speed in level flight. It showed a readiness to wait
on, a characteristic of both Peregrines and Lanners. The chest was heavier
than that of a Lanner but lighter than a Peregrine&amp;apos;s. Feet were much larger
than a Lanner's and strongly built. Peregrine colouration predominated but
some Lanner characteristics penetrated. This bird flew quite dynamically
in its first year and was flown at Magpies. In its second year it lacked
motivation but may have been sick.
9) peregrinus x jugger (Peregrine x Luggar). I have heard of one indi-

vidual that was produced in Germany by inseminating an exceptionally
strong passage Luggar with Peregrine sperm. The hybrid was said to be
fast and aggressive and was flown successfully at Rooks.
10) cherrug x jugger (Saker x Luggar). Two individuals, produced in
England, were trained to wait on and were flown successfully at partridge
and grouse.
11) peregrinus x sparverius (Peregrine x American Kestrel). In the case
of the two individuals I know of, the size is intermediate between parent
species. Kestrel coloration is dominant, but the chest is heavy and the feet
large, though not so much so as a Peregrine. With the long thin wings of a
Kestrel and powerful pectorals of a Peregrine, these birds were surprising-
ly functional as fliers. One kept at hack could outfly wild starlings.
12) rusticolus x columbarius (Gyrfalcon x Merlin). The bird I knew of,
twice as heavy as a female Merlin and half as heavy as a male Gyr, had

the proclivity of both parent species for fast, persistent tailchases. It was
lost in its first season chasing quarry out of sight. Coloration was like that
of an immature grey Gyr and the tail was quite long.
13) peregrinus x columbarius (Peregrine x Merlin). In three cases, the
size is intermediate between parent species. Merlin coloration
predominates. Two of these birds fly like Peregrines and wait on well, pre-
ferring stooping to tail-chasing. The third has a Merlin-like tendency to
tail chase.
14) peregrinus x rufigularis (Peregrine x Bat Falcon). A colour photo-
graph of this hybrid in first-year plumage shows the Bat Falcon coloura-
tion clearly dominant. The only apparent Peregrine colouration is the
bluish-grey back, lighter than a Bat Falcon's, and curiously enough it is an

adult Peregrine characteristic.
15) peregrinus x deiroleucus (Peregrine x Orange-breasted Falcon). At
least three examples of this cross have been produced. They are said to be
very fast fliers. Most flew rather like Peregrines but one is reported to
have a marked preference for tail-chasing rather than stooping.
16) {( pelegrinoides x mexicanus ) x mexicanus } x rusticolus (a

Shahin/Prairie hybrid crossed with a Gyrfalcon). The resultant male bird
had Prairie-like colouration in his first year but now in adult plumage is
coloured like a grey Gyr with a very whitish breast. He is no heavier than
a large tiercel Peregrine and is elongate in build, with exceptionally long
legs and tail. He is amazingly fast and agile and has a tendency to chase
quarry all over the sky and landscape. He will wait on but has a tendency
to dash off after distant quarry. He seems to prefer upland game to water-
fowl, although he has taken several ducks.
17) {pelegrinoides x mexicanus ) x mexicanus {(Shahin x Prairie) x
Prairie}. Several of these birds, the result of backcrossing an FI Shahin x
Prairie, have been produced. The colouration is like a Prairie in the first
year. In adult plumage the breast is white with a few dark streaks and
teardrop markings like a Prairie, but the top of the head is reddish. These
birds are not as fast as tribred 16.
18) {pelegrinoides x columbarius) x mexicanus {(Merlin x Shahin) x
Prairie}. This bird was obtained by crossing a tiercel Shahin with a female
Merlin, and then crossing the FI with a Prairie. Merlin colouration was
dominant in the first-year plumage but there may have been some Prairie
penetration. It was said to be a capable flier. The build was comparatively
broad and the tail was relatively shorter than a Merlin&amp;apos;s.
19) {rusticolus x peregrinus) x rusticolus (a Gyr/Peregrine hybrid back-
crossed to a Gyr). The single example, a tiercel, flies very much like a
Gyr.

backcrossed to a Peregrine). The single example, a tiercel, flies very much
like a Peregrine.
In recent years several more examples of backcrosses 19 and 20 have
been produced, with flying styles consistent with those noted here.
In looking over the experience with hybrid falcons so far, I am
impressed by how often the hybrids are aerodynamically very competent
even if they come from parent species with markedly different sizes and
wing loadings. Examples are the Peregrine x Kestrel cross, the pereginus x
columbarius cross and the Gyr x Merlin cross. This may merit further
attention by geneticists.

THE RESPONSE OF AN AFRICAN GREY PARROT
TO NEWLY-HATCHED CHICKS.

From time to time one reads reports of newly-hatched parrot chicks being
killed or severely injured by the adults. The following observation may sug-
gest a possible explanation for some such occurrences.
The birds involved are a pair of African Grey Parrots Psittacus erithacus
both previously kept as pet birds and consequently very tame. Both birds were
known to be over ten years old when first given the opportunity to breed. The
pair is housed in a cage of 4' x 3' x 3' high (1.22 x 0.91 x 0.91m), with a nest
box attached to the outside. After a series of infertile clutches, fertile eggs
were finally produced, but the young were killed by the hen at hatching. After
this had been repeated a couple of times the eggs were removed at the point of
hatching, hatched in an incubator and the young reared by hand. Eventually it
was decided to attempt to reintroduce newly hatched young to the female in
case it was the process of hatching that caused her to kill them. Such interfer-

ence was only possible because the hen was so tame and did not resent distur-
bance, although the cock had to be removed first as he proved to be too
aggressive. The three eggs were taken at the point of hatching and placed in an
incubator as usual. In the meantime the hen was given a plaster pigeon's egg
to incubate.
When the first chick to hatch was dry it was replaced in the nest while the
hen was absent. The side of the nest-box was left open in order to monitor
what subsequently occurred. The hen did not object to this. Upon entering the
nest and discovering the chick the hen seemed to become extremely excited
and immediately began to "clean" the chick all over, the action being reminis-
cent of a cat or dog towards newly bom young. Special attention was paid to
the tips of the wings and the toes, in fact some of the toes were quite exten-
sively bruised, to the extent that one claw was later lost. The actions of the hen
were fast and jerky, at times appearing quite rough, so much so that once or
twice the chick was knocked from under her, at which point she continued for
a moment to groom her own feet before retrieving the chick. Throughout this
performance the hen kept up a continuous low crooning, growling sound
which I had never heard before. These actions continued for about ten min-
utes, by which time the chick appeared to be getting weaker, being subjected
as it was to almost constant attention. During this time the hen had made no
attempt to feed the chick, so in order to give it some respite and enable it to
regain strength, I removed it for a few minutes, during which time it was fed
once by spoon. It says a lot for the tolerance of the hen that she allowed me to
put my hand under her both to remove the chick and later to replace it. By the
time the chick was returned the hen appeared to have calmed down and was
more gentle towards it. As everything seemed to be going reasonably well the
nest-box was closed and the cock was readmitted. The following day as the
chick was still alive, the two other chicks that had hatched in the meantime
were added to the nest. All three young were reared without any problems.
I decided to leave the eggs of the next clutch to hatch under the hen, but to
keep a close watch on events. When the first chick pipped the shell and began
to call, the hen chewed it out of the egg, apparently being too stimulated. This
action, of course, resulted in the death of the chick. The other two chicks were
hatched in the incubator and returned to the nest, being subsequently reared
without any problem. Since then the pair has gone on to hatch and rear a num-
ber of broods quite normally. It would appear that the death of the early chicks
was the unfortunate result of too much attention from the inexperienced hen,
the chicks dying of exhaustion if they managed to hatch in the first place, and
subsequent chewing of the dead chicks being a normal means of cleaning up
the nest cavity.
Evidence that this response to newly-hatched young may be widespread
among psittacines was obtained from observation of a hen Splendid Parrakeet

Neophema splendida which had laid in the comer of a flight cage. The first
chick to hatch had pipped the shell but had been unable to proceed further due
to the drying of the membrane. The egg was opened manually and the chick
returned to the nest, whereupon the hen responded towards it in exactly the
same way as had the African Grey. This particular hen was an experienced
breeder and so the chick was reared successfully, but it is encouraging to leam
from the above case that a bird which has a history of destroying young may
eventually come to rear her young successfully.

The bird market at Guan Yuan in Beijing (Peking) was a major disappoint-
ment on New Year's Day and the day after since both sellers and customers
were more involved in seeing in the Year of the Dragon than in feathered trad-
ing. However on 17th February (the second day) one seller had ten or a dozen
Hwameis (Brown Laughing Thrushes) Garrulax canorus for sale, and two
men each carried a Marsh Tit Par us palustris in a cage. The next afternoon the
tally was as follows.
The exotics were sixty Budgerigars Melopsittacus undulatus. The birds of
species indigenous to China were: twenty-four Hwameis (Brown Laughing
Thrushes), four Mongolian Larks Melanocorypha mongolica, five Eurasian
Siskins Carduelis spinus, three Bramblings Fringilla montifringilla, two
Parus sp. (not palustris ) and one each of Little Bunting Emberiza pusilla ,
Meadow Bunting Emberiza cioides. Chestnut Bunting E. rutila. Red-billed
Leiothrix (Peking Robin) Leiothrix lutea, Grey-capped (Oriental) Greenfinch
Carduelis sinica and Chestnut-flanked White-eye Zosterops erythropleura.
The tally at three or four bird shops in the general free market near the
Confucius Temple in Nanjing on 22nd February was: Exotic species: Canary
Serinus canaria numerous, 114 Budgerigars; Indigenous species: two Grey-

capped (Oriental) Greenfinches, three Lord Derby's Parakeet Psittacula der-
biana , six Crested Mynas Acridotheres grandis, 13 Red-billed Leiothrix
(Pekin Robins), 58 Mongolian Larks and 215 Hwamei (Brown Laughing
Thrushes).
If we compare Nanjing with earlier censuses in Beijing and Chengdu
(Boswall, 1986), we find that the Hwamei (Brown Laughing Thrush) is in all
five cities the most popular songster with the Mongolian Lark second.
Cormorant Fishing
I saw six different (Great) Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo fishermen on
the Gang river near Jiujiang, Shanxi province, between 24th and 26th
February. All had between five and seven birds, some of them partial albinos.
Pigeon rearing
As previously observed in Harbin, Beijing, Chengdu and one or two small-
er Chinese cities, the most noticeable birds in X'ion, Nanjing (Nanking) and
Nanchang were pigeons Columba livia. These birds apparently all belong to
lofts. Not once did I see any pigeons in town squares or parks, on roadside
verges or traffic islands. The feral pigeon of Trafalgar Square and St. Mark's
Square is absent. Why I wonder?

A VICULTURE IN A USTRALIA
In recent years there has been a proliferation of avicultural titles - but it
is rarely that a reviewer can praise every aspect of a book: content, presen-
tation, illustrations and author's style and knowledge. What a joy, there-
fore, to be presented with an advance copy of Aviculture in Australia and
to unhesitatingly place it in this category.
This is the first title from Black Cockatoo Press, a company owned by
the Australian Andrew Isles, whose bookshop in Melbourne surely carries
the world's largest stock of avicultural titles. The author is Mark
Shephard, a young biochemist but an experienced aviculturist. He has cov-
ered, in 380 pages, all the native species in Australian aviculture, as well
as the best known exotic ones. His coverage is extraordinarily thorough,
summarising all the relevant information on each species under the head-
ings of Other Names, Distribution and Habitat, Sub-species, Status in
Aviculture, General Avicultural Notes, Mutations and Colour Variations.
I know of no other avicultural book which has been so thoroughly ref-
erenced. Dozens of references to relevant avicultural literature are given at
the conclusion of each chapter. There are 253 references for the chapter on

<bodyText confidence="0.883114933333333" page_id="58075321"  page_num="164" year="" vol="">
Chapters cover: Nutrition, Management, Parrots, Lorikeets, Cockatoos,
Finches, Quail, Softbills, Pigeons, Foreign Parrots, Foreign Finches,
Pheasants and Waterfowl, Basic Avian Genetics, Common Diseases and,
finally. The Practical Value of Aviculture.
This book can be readily understood by someone with no knowledge of
aviculture yet because of its wealth of detail and comprehensiveness, it is
of equal interest to the experienced aviculturist - a style that few authors
can achieve.
It has numerous uncomplicated tables and line drawings and the colour
photographs are of quite exceptional quality. Aviculture in Australia must
be considered the definitive work on the subject to date. It costs A$50. In
due course it will be obtainable from avicultural booksellers in the UK and
elsewhere. At present it can be obtained only from Andrew Isles
Bookshops, P.O.Box 358, Prahran 3188, Australia. There will be a small
additional charge for surface postage or substantially more for airmail.

It would be difficult to find two people better qualified to write on
Australian cockatoos. Stan Sindel is an internationally recognised avicul-
turist and author of the first book in this series, Australian Lorikeets.
Sadly, Robert Lynn, perhaps the leading authority on black cockatoos in
aviculture, died before this book was published. We are fortunate to have
the benefit of his knowledge and experience - and there could be no more
fitting tribute to his memory.
Although the book is co-authored, it is written in the first person the
senior author being Stan Sindel. Stan's irrepressible personality shines
through the pages, so that sometimes it is like listening to him talk. His
style is immensely readable.
The book commences with a practical chapter on Housing. I would
emphasise the word practical as it is the hallmark of the book. Of sus-
pended aviaries Stan writes: "My observations suggest that cockatoos
housed in this system do not feel as secure as when housed in secluded
conventional aviaries." I agree. Most cockatoos are much too nervous to
do well in this type of environment, unlike many Amazons, for example.
In the chapter on Diet there is information on the preferences of the
various species, including the native foods of the Black Cockatoos. Hand-
rearing foods are also described. Management, including handrearing, is
covered in the next chapter, followed by Diseases by James Gill (seven
pages). This includes a page on the importance of quarantine, which
breeders of all species would do well to read carefully.
The following pages, nearly 200 (of the total of 252), are devoted to
accounts of the species. Each one is treated under the headings of
Classification, Range , Habitat and Field Notes, Diet in the wild, Breeding
in the wild, Sexing, Display, Nests, Nesting and hatching and Mutations
(his interest in the latter is well known). The field notes are extensive:
Stan Sindel has spent hours in the field. Australians are fortunate in being
able to study in the wild many of the species they keep in their aviaries. It
gives them a far greater understanding of their birds than Europeans can
hope to achieve.
I was extremely impressed by this book - by the authors' love of their
subjects, their deep knowledge and Stan Sindel's thoroughness in delving
into past avicultural literature to present a complete picture of Australian
Cockatoos.
Talking of pictures, there are 40 pages of colour, 121 colour pho-
tographs, outstanding for their quality or interest. Some very pleasing
uncluttered portraits by Cyril Laubscher grace the pages and, equally
appealing to me, were smaller photographs, four to six for each species,
showing the development of chicks. Identification of subspecies, as in the
Roseate, for example, is made easy with the help of photographs.

and Wayne McLeod (Senior Keeper)
The African Grey Hombill Tockus nasutus occurs in Africa and South
West Arabia. In sub-saharan Africa it ranges north of the equator from
Senegal to Eritrea and over much of southern Africa excepting the
extreme south. Sometimes referred to as simply the Grey Hornbill this
species should not be confused with the Common Grey Hombill Tockus
birostris of India.
Mainly grey and brown with paler underparts, the sexes of the African
Grey Hombill differ in the colour of the bill. The male&amp;apos;s bill is mainly
black with a small casque on the top and a white patch at the base of the
upper mandible, whereas in the female the casque ridge is less pronounced
and the upper bill dark red at the tip and yellow at the base. Of three
subspecies listed by White (1965) as occurring in Africa (a fourth is
described from South West Arabia), only two are currently recognised
(Fry, Keith and Urban, 1988). The nominate Tockus nasutus nasutus is
found in Africa north of the equator, whilst the smaller Tockus nasutus
epirhinus occupies southern Africa. The latter is distinguished in that the
males have a pointed tip to the black casque. The females are less easy to
distinguish but in the southerly subspecies the ridges at the base of the
lower mandible are described as being less pronounced (Fry, Keith and
Urban, 1988; Mackworth-Praed &amp; Grant, 1957).
Chester Zoo obtained one male and two female African Grey Hombills
in March 1985. This trio had been recently imported from Botswana and
belongs to the southern subspecies Tockus nasutus epirhinus. From arrival
all three birds were held together in one of the upper aviaries in the
Tropical House being moved to their present breeding aviary in December
1986. This large aviary measures 12.0 x 2.6 x 3.5 metres high and is
planted with a selection of tropical plants including Monstera, Ficus , and

Hibiscus , and during the last four years has at different times housed, ir
addition to the Hornbills, pairs of Little Black Bustard Afrotis atra
Roulroul Partridge Rollulus roulroul. Golden Heart Pigeon Gallicolumba
rufigula later replaced by Luzon Bleeding Heart Pigeon Gallicolumba
luzonica and Royal Starling Cosmopsarus regius.
No problems were encountered with these groupings until 1990 wher
the African Grey Hornbills disrupted the breeding attempts of the Roya
Starlings. Our Hornbills are fed a diet that includes soaked Zoo Food A
chopped fruit, usually apple, pear, tomato and grapes, sprinkled with
commercial insectile food and SA37 vitamin supplement. Live food in the
form of mealworms and locusts, and freshly killed pink mice or rats are
offered daily and proved important food items during the breeding cycle.
Display was frequent from all three Hornbills; all were observed tc
display by calling with the bill pointed skywards whilst rocking backwards
and forwards, simultaneously extending and closing their wings. The male
favoured the company of one of the two females and although no threai
displays or aggressive behaviour was observed we decided it prudent tc
rehouse the second female in one of the lower aviaries in March 1988
Although out of sight of the pair, the single female continued to call anc
display.
The Hornbills accepted a parakeet-type wooden nesting box fittec
vertically on the back wall of their aviary. This box measured 30 cm
square x 60 cm deep and had an entrance hole of 9 cm diameter near the
top of the front face. The box was filled with peat to a depth of about 31
cm. Interest in the nest-box was first shown in April 1988 when the male
began feeding the female and would then fly up to the box with, foi
example, a locust in his bill and try to entice her into the nest. Mudding up
of the nest entrance with soil and peat began on 16th April and by 1st May
the female was completely sealed inside the box, only a slit of 1.5 - 2.0 cm
remaining through which the female was fed by its attentive mate.
An increased frequency of feeding of the female by the male noted on
31st May was taken to indicate that a chick or chicks were now being fed.
The male then carried fruit and especially live food including mealworms,
locusts and pink mice to the nest. Food items were carried singly and nest
visits were then necessarily very frequent. So keen to feed the female was
he that he would take locusts from the hand. The female broke out of the
nest on 27th June and the entrance was then mudded up again before being
again broken for the emergence of the first fledgling on 13th July. A
second chick fledged on the 14th and a third on 15th July. The third chick
appeared weaker than the others and was removed for hand-feeding but
died on 17th July from what was suspected to have been a Candida
infection. The fourth chick emerged on 18th July but was killed by a rat

that had gained temporary access to the aviary. After breaking out of the
nest the female assisted the male in feeding the chicks in the box and both
parents fed the chicks for a short period after they fledged. The chicks
were first seen feeding themselves on 24th July. The two surviving chicks
were left with their parents and by December 1988 the reddening of the
itips of the young birds&amp;apos; bills indicated that both were females. They were
removed and rehoused with the single adult female before the adult pair
showed signs of re-nesting in Spring 1989.
Inspection of the nest contents indicated not only that the female had
moulted at least her wing and tail feathers but also that the parent birds
had carried bark stripped off a beech log into the nest-box. No nest
sanitation in terms of removal of faecal sacs was noted and presumably
this provision of fresh bark assisted with nest hygiene.
The 1989 breeding attempt was initiated in April with the female being
completely mudded in by the 25th of that month. Increased feeding
activity by the male indicated at least one chick had hatched by 27th May.
Following a very hot spell of weather we noticed that the female was not
seen at the nest-box entrance from 27th June. Although the young birds
were seen taking food at the nest-hole from the male our concern
increased that the female might have died and so on 3rd July we took
down the nest-box and removed the top panel to find the dead female
together with three rather dishevelled but living chicks. Because of our
concern that the oppressive heat may have caused the female&amp;apos;s death the
nest-box was relocated, after it had been thoroughly cleaned and re-filled
with fresh peat, at a point about a metre lower in the aviary. The male soon
began to fly to the newly positioned box with food in his bill but it took a
long hour before the chicks were sufficiently confident to reach up to the
nest slit to accept this food. The first chick fledged on 13th July and the
two remaining nestlings were then observed re-mudding the nest entrance.
On 19th July the second chick fledged but it was not until the 28th that the
final chick emerged. The rearing of these three chicks was completed by
the male alone and all survived to maturity as two females and one male.
These three young birds were re-housed with the two 1988 bred birds
in winter 1989/90 and the single adult female then moved into the
enclosure with the bereaved male. Two successive nesting attempts were
made by this new pair in spring/summer of 1990 but neither resulted in
fledged chicks. The male was seen feeding the female in early March but
the positioning of the nest-box appeared unacceptable to them. We moved
the nest-box to a new site and from 4th April the female was seen staying
inside the box for long periods and by the 16th had mudded herself in
from inside the box. Noises heard from the box on 21st May and the
increased frequency of feeding by the male suggested that chicks had

hatched. However, the female emerged without fledglings on 21st June.
The nest-box was cleaned out and re-peated and to our surprise on 11th
July, just over a fortnight since she emerged from her first failed breeding
attempt, the female had again mudded herself in the nest-box. Sadly this
attempt also failed with no young reared to independence in 1990.
Inspection of the nest-box after both failed attempts in 1990 revealed
neither dead chicks nor eggs but indicated that on both occasions the
female had moulted her wing and tail feathers whilst inside the box. The
link between incarceration and moult must be particularly strong for the
female to have undergone two moults in such a short time period.
The International Zoo Yearbooks report breeding of the African Grey
Hornbill at Walsrode, West Germany, and at Pittsburgh Aviary,
Pennsylvania, U.S.A., in 1982. Since that date breedings of this species
have also been reported from Cape Town World of Birds, South Africa,
and the Cincinatti Zoo, U.S.A. We can find no previous records of the
breeding of the African Grey Hornbill in the United Kingdom and believe
this may be the first. We would be delighted to hear of anyone else holding
this subspecies of the African Grey Hornbill so that our young birds may
be correctly paired.

This pair was purchased in 1974. They were shy, imported birds and
placed in a small box cage indoors.
Breeding results were inconstant throughout the years. Sometimes I
had to hand-feed a chick, when the parents did not feed it properly. The
following table gives a summary of the breeding results.

The incubation period was four weeks. The young spent 9-10 weeks in
the nest. They were taken away from the parents three weeks after
fledging. The average weight of the males at that time was 240 gr and of
the females 220 gr. The average weight of all birds older than a year was
310 gr and 260 gr (males and females).

The nest-box measures 25 x 25 x 40 cm high. The best breeding results
were obtained in recent years. I think that using a box cage plays an
important role as shy birds feel more secure in a sheltered cage. However,
compatibility of the pair is necessary, as the female cannot escape from an
aggressive male.

<bodyText confidence="0.999811947368421" page_id="58075337"  page_num="172" year="" vol="">
Little has changed since 1974. The birds eat sunflower, canary, hemp,
rice, soaked maize and peas, moist bread sprinkled with a vitamin-mineral
powder, greenfood and since 1989 a pellet for parrots.
Breeding attempts by the young
Over the years four young were paired to imported partners. They
could not choose their partner.
A young male from 1974 was paired to an imported female in 1975.
They had a chick in 1978, but it was thrown out of the nest shortly after
hatching. There were no more breeding attempts and the female was found
dead in the nest-box two years later.
The home-bred female of 1975 was placed together with an imported
male in 1980. She started to feather-pluck two months later. Sometimes
she injured her skin and she died in 1984, her breast covered with blood.
There were no breeding attempts.
A young male from 1976 was paired to an imported female in 1978.
They had broken eggs in 1983, 1984 and 1985. The pair was sold in 1986.
The homebred female ol 1980 was put together with an imported male
in 1981. She has plucked her feathers since 1985 and sometimes she
bleeds from her breast. There have been no breeding attempts.

Feather plucking
This is especially a problem with the females. The young of 1976 were
a male and a female. When an imported female was placed in their outside
aviary in 1978, the young female started to feather pluck.
The young of 1977 were two females. They were sold and placed
together in a large cage. I heard from the new owner that they plucked
their breast feathers some years later.
A hand-fed young male of 1982 bit his flight- and tail-feathers off
shortly after he was sold at the age of four months. He repeated this almost
every year.
In 1984 someone gave me an imported female. She had plucked her
feathers since her partner escaped. I placed her in an inside aviary together
with an imported male ( pair 2 ). She also plucked the male.
Breeding pair 2
In 1985 there were only eggs. After that I placed them in a large box-
cage indoors. In 1986 they had two young. These were badly plucked.
When they climbed out of the nest, they had only down. Their body- and
tail-feathers soon reappeared, but they still cannot fly. In 1987 Pair 2 had
one young. It again was plucked, but some flight feathers were left and he
could fly short distances. In 1988 there were no young. In 1989 one young
hatched. When the young of Pair 1 were taken away from the parents three
weeks after fledging, the young of Pair 2 was 16 days old. I placed him in
the nest-box of Pair 1. He was accepted and reared without problems. The
young of both pairs already have red lores in the nest, just as the adults.
Conclusions
Two major problems were experienced while breeding Goffin&amp;apos;s
Cockatoo: the lack of success in rearing a second generation and feather-
plucking. The causes of the first problem are probably the pairing of
home-bred to imported birds and the forced pair formation. Feather-
plucking is a connected problem, caused by stress and sexual frustration. I
have taken the following measures to solve the problems: I do not form
mixed pairs of home-bred and imported birds any more and I keep the
young in a group until they are sexually mature and have formed
compatible pairs spontaneously. I observe the group by video camera and
try to avoid stressful situations especially for the females.

SUCCESSFUL BREEDING OF THE RUFOUS-HEADED
CHACHALACA Ortalis erythroptera
(SCLATER AND SALVIN, 1870)
IN THE ORNITHOLOGICAL ZOO AT SCHMIDING, AUSTRIA
By Andreas Artmann
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993557" page_id="58075339"  page_num="174" year="" vol="">
The genus Chachalaca includes 10 to 12 species. It is ontogenetically
the most primitive within the family of the Cracidae.
The inconspicuous and lustreless plumage which is the same for both
sexes, the absence of a beak wattle, as well as a crest which can be raised
by means of the crown feather, are characteristics of this genus.
A further special feature of the Chachalacas is their habitat in Central
and South America. While the other Cracidae live predominantly in the
forest, the Chachalacas live in the man-created secondary bush zone.
These birds are thus one of the few living beings which profit from man&amp;apos;s
destruction of the forest in Latin America.
Because of their inconspicuous appearance, the Chachalacas were
hardly ever imported and only rarely kept in zoos and in the case of the
Rufous-headed Chachalaca there has been, so far, no published record of
their being kept in captivity.
For the definition of the various species, their geographical distribution,
which hardly ever overlaps, is used. Thus the Rufous-headed Chachalaca
is the only Chachalaca species which is found in Western Ecuador and
Northwest Peru. Further peculiarities of these Chachalacas are the reddish-
brown head and neck feathers, the blue-greyish orbital region as well as
the chestnut-brown tail feathers. Its breast feathers are chestnut-brown but
are of a lighter brown down to the belly and are then of a greyish yellow.
The back and the wings are brown.
Care
In the Ornithological Zoo at Schmiding the breeding pair of Rufous-
headed Chachalacas is kept in a roofed, open-air flight (about 50 sq.
metres, 4.4 metres high) with an adjoining indoor room. The open-air
flight, which contains tree trunks, various tree branches and stones,
includes an area of dense growth as well as an open, sandy area. The diet
of the Chachalacas consists of a mixed feed of finely grated heart of beef,
grated carrots, eggs and mealy, prepacked chicken feed. Finely-cut fruit,
especially bananas and coarsely grated apples, shredded lettuce and baby
food are also used. An additional source of animal protein are mealworms
which are fed at intervals of a few days.

The specifically typical calls and sounds which led to the name of
Chachalacas we could seldom hear from our birds, but very loud and
penetrating screeches when the birds were scared or angry, were heard.
Although the Chachalacas know their keeper very well and are capable of
distinguishing him from other humans they nevertheless always prefer to
keep a certain distance between themselves and any humans.
Breeding
In May 1989 the breeding pair of Chachalacas was given a nesting site
in the indoor room in the shape of an artificially pre-formed nest of dried
grasses which the birds readily accepted. Already by the 27th of the same
month two white eggs were found in the nest. One day later the third egg
was laid. This set of eggs was removed and put in an incubator on 1st
June.
On 29th June, that is after an incubating period of 28 days, at a
temperature of 36.8 Celsius, two Chachalaca chicks hatched. The third
egg was infertile. The weight at hatching was 40 g and 38 g respectively.
Because of the well-developed down, the Chachalaca chicks appear
rotund. In proportion to the body, the head is rather large, the pink legs are
comparatively short. The colouring of the head, back, wings and the tail is
of an uneven rust-brown, chestnut-brown to dark brown and black. The
down changes in colour from the rust-brown breast onwards to the belly,
getting lighter until it is completely white as is the case with fully grown
mature birds. The underside of the beak (chin and throat) is white, the
point of the beak is black. The base of the upper part of the beak is pink.
The dark brown eyes are surrounded by a soft white-blue orbital region.
On the first day of their lives the young birds were put into a rearing
box ( 100 x 50 x 50 cm ). The floor of the box was sanded, and feed and
water containers were placed on rough kitchen paper which was changed
daily. One side of the rearing box was heated by an infra-red radiator.
During their first days, the young birds were fed the above described feed,
finely grated apples with baby food as well as freshly skinned and
decapitated mealworms. In order to ensure a sufficient supply of vitamins
and minerals, starting the second day the feed was given an addition of a
multi-vitamin and mineral composite as available in the trade. At the
beginning, the young birds were given the feed by means of tweezers but
they soon learnt to feed by themselves and, after three days, feeding by
tweezers was discontinued.
Now the rearing box was altered. Small branches and roots enabled the
Chachalaca chicks to try out their wings and provided ample and diverse
means of exercise.
Starting on the seventh day, one of the young birds showed signs of
lessening activity as well as slower body and weight growth and died on

the 12th day. The autopsy showed an unspecified enteritis.
From the second week, finely cut lettuce or dandelion leaves were fed
in addition to the original feed. At the age of about three weeks the young
Chachalaca was resettled in a larger, indoor flight, together with two
young Amazon Razor-billed Curassows Crax mitu tuberosa. He was now
completely self-sufficient, could fly very well and got orr^excellently with
the other young birds.
In the meantime it was mid-June and the first set of second breeding
eggs had been laid although not brooded and were found to be infertile.
On 27th July a check of the nest found a second set of three eggs. This
time the female bird sat on the eggs and on 18th August, that is after at
least 26 days of brooding, three Chachalaca chicks hatched. A few hours
after hatching the young birds left the nest and followed the Chachalaca
hen.
It is very important to provide branches so that the young birds, which
during their first days of life are unable to fly, can get back to their nest.
Otherwise the parent birds fly up to their roost and spend the night apart
from their young. The young would cower on the ground and could easily
catch cold. This situation when the young, during their first days of life,
spend the night apart from their parents, has also been observed in nature
with other Chachalacas.
During the first days after hatching the Chachalaca family was kept in
the protected indoor room because this facilitated a more exact observance
of the well-being of the young birds. Although the temperature of the
indoor room was constant, the young birds were able to warm themselves
below an infra-red radiator.
The composition of the feed was in all essentials adhered to, although
the Chachalaca chicks were given a feed which was more finely cut up.
During the first days of life, mealworms were only fed shortly after they
had been skinned and beheaded. As with feeding by hand a vitamin and
mineral composite was added. At first the parent birds offered the feed to
their young by holding it in their beaks from which the young birds avidly
picked it off. The young Chachalacas quickly learnt to feed by themselves
but still liked to be offered food by their parents when a few weeks old.
Although Rufous-headed Chachalacas could manage without the help of
their parents at only a few days old the development of these typically
precocious birds is relatively slow. The young birds only reached their full
size at six months and were then settled in another flight. The breeding
pair ot Chachalacas was offered a new nesting site whereupon the birds
infmediately started breeding.

Protein Products. A second feeding is added in the late afternoon when ;
chick is being fed.
A small, gradually sloping concrete pool provides both drinking am
bathing water. The exhibit is serviced once daily between 1:00 and 3:0(
pm. Artificial nest-baskets, measuring 20 cm in diameter and 8 cm ir
depth, were placed at varying heights in some of the larger plants. A paii
of Luzon Bleeding Heart Doves Gallicolumha luzonica was alsc
maintained in this display.
A single pair of Black-naped Fruit Doves was placed in the enclosure
on 5th January 1987, following a one-month quarantine period. The first
egg was laid on 7th February in a nest-basket. The nest was wired in a tree
tork at a height of 2 m. No nest material was added to the nest by the
birds. Incubation was by both sexes, but the female was always seen on
the egg early and late in the day and seemed to perform the majority of
incubation. The male was never seen on the egg longer than three hours in
any one period. The male would frequently perch within a quarter metre of
the nest when the female was incubating.

The egg pipped on 26th February after a 20-day incubation. The
llowing day the male was observed regurgitating to the chick. Both
*es were seen feeding the chick. The chick left the nest on the twelfth
y after hatching, and flight was observed the next day. The body size of
fledgling is less than half that of the adult, with the exception of the
her fully developed wings. The adult birds would regularly sit next to
s chick and would occasionally drape one wing over the chick. The
ick never descended to the ground unless forced to do so by some action
the keeper.
The first chick was a male which was confirmed by observation of grey
athers coming in between the base of the bill and the eye. These feathers
st appear around four to five weeks, as mentioned by Goodwin in
geons and Doves of the World. Young males have never been known to
lour up later than at eight weeks old, although the first grey feathers
ay be difficult to detect. This first chick was removed from the parents&amp;apos;
closure at 39 days, the same day the second egg was laid. At this age the
lick had been seen self-feeding and it experienced no difficulty feeding
ter being separated from the adults.
This pair of Fruit Doves and a second breeding pair have been housed
several different locations during the last three years. In addition to the
eviously described exhibit in the Tropical Bird House, birds were
msed in a similar but smaller display. The second display was only 10.5
uare metres, but the same height (3.7m). The nest basket in this exhibit
as placed at a height of 1.5 m Fruit Doves also bred in an off-exhibit area
the basement of the bird house. The cages were constructed of wood
ames and 2.54 x 2.54 cm galvanized welded wire. The enclosure
easured 2.4 x 1.9 m, and was 1.8 m in height. The food and water dishes
ere on a platform 1.5 m off the floor. The substrate was concrete covered
ith wood shavings. Visual barriers were provided by hanging opaque
astic sheets from the top of the cages.
Black-naped Fruit Doves are prolific breeders and will lay sequential
utches with little or no pause between rearing offspring and laying the
ixt egg. The female has often produced the next clutch while the male is
eding the recently fledged offspring. Our most successful pair reared six
fspring one year, six the next year, and four the following year. Forty-
ie clutches from three different pairs were one-egg clutches.
The most successful reproduction occurred in the largest and most
javily planted exhibit. The smaller the enclosure and the less privacy the
rds had, the more frequently eggs were broken or laid in inappropriate
aces, such as on the ground. Once a pair had established a record of
lccessful breeding, however, they could be moved to less spacious
irroundings and breeding would continue.

Observed incubation periods varied between 18 to 26 days. Tb
average of 17 incubation periods was 21.5 days. Incubation of the egg i
nearly constant and the female contributes the majority of the effort. Bot !
parents were seen to feed the chick. Hatching weights for seven chick
ranged from 5.3 grams to 6.7 grams with a mean hatch weight 6.1 grams
The period of time before the chick left the nest varied from 8 to 14 days
The mean of 12 fledging periods was 11.7 days. The average of thre&lt;
fledgling weights was 26 grams and the average weight of the same threi
birds when separated from their parents was 84 grams. Average adul
weights of eight males and seven females were 109 and 101 gram:
respectively.
Black-naped Fruit Doves are hardy and prolific if set up properly
Aviculturists should make every effort to establish this easily manage(
bird as a captive population. So many species are imported and breed well
but after a few years of neglect decline to the point where they are los
from captivity unless additional birds are acquired. The North Americar
regional studbook, recently established at the North Carolina Zoo anc
administered by Curator of Birds, Ron Morris, should help to secure tht
future of this attractive Fruit Dove in captivity.

The delightful Black-crowned, or Black-capped Waxbill, as it is
otherwise called is little known to British aviculturists as it is imported
very infrequently and then only in small numbers.
It is distributed across tropical central Africa, from Nigeria and
Cameroons right through to extreme south-western Sudan, Uganda and
Kenya.
Within this area it is often to be found in small flocks around forest
clearings and on mountain slopes and at altitudes up to 2,500 metres
, (higher than any other waxbill) where temperatures are often only about
:5*C.
The sexes of this beautiful and delicately coloured bird, as far as I can
tell, are identical in physical appearance. Briefly the markings are as
follows:- forehead, crown and nape - black; rump and flanks - pink to
crimson; back - grey diffused to white with a subtle bairing effect
noticeable on close inspection; breast - white to grey.
Although rarely available a few small consignments of these birds have
been available over the past few years and it was in late February 1988
that I purchased four of these enchanting waxbilis from an importer.
Once safely home and introduced to a large flight cage in the bird
room, they were initially allowed a temperature of 15 C before this was
gradually and I stress gradually , reduced to the normal temperature of the
bird room over the next couple of months.
I made a point of only heating one end of the flight cage so that each
individual bird was allowed to choose the part of the cage which it found
most comfortable. The heat was provided by using a 300 mm tubular
heater wired through a thermostat. By early May the heater was switched
off in preparation for the change to summer quarters. This consisted of an
unheated inside flight from where they were to be fed.
In mid-May three of these birds were given access to a large outside
planted flight after spending a week or so in the inside flight to become
accustomed to the change in surroundings.
A nest was constructed of coconut fibre, feathers and moss approx.
1.5 m from the ground. It was a typical waxbill s nest with a tunnel and a
&amp;quot;cock's nest&amp;quot; above the main nesting chamber. The downward pointing
tunnel entrance faced in a westerly direction, as did those of subsequent
nests.

On the morning of 9th June, I checked carefully the eggs which
appeared to be fertile. Once this was ascertained the nest was left well
alone as the adults seemed very nervous and at the slightest hint of danger
they would leave the nest, but would retire quickly once the &amp;apos;danger&amp;apos; had
passed.
Two chicks hatched, possibly on 20th June, and by 13th July these had
fledged but returned to the nest shortly after fledging.
The following day, on finding no chicks flying about, I checked the
nest with trepidation only to be delighted with a finger count of three.
The chicks were soon fully fledged and gaining strength and size. Upon
leaving the nest the chicks were very much like their parents although they
lacked the red and were generally a little duller particularly on the breast.
By 23rd July a second nest was being constructed, again 1.5 m from the
ground and facing in a westerly direction. This time though, the efforts put
into building a &amp;quot;cock&amp;apos;s nest&amp;quot; were directed towards the first nest which was
subsequently enlarged, leaving the second nest free from any such
attention.
On 28th July, the first egg of the second round was laid and by 1st
August the nest had received a full clutch of four white eggs. Three of the
eggs had hatched by 17th August, followed a day later by the fourth egg.
All four of the chicks successfully fledged together on 8th September.
So despite my numerous intrusions to check the progress within the
nesting chamber, all seven chicks were successfully hatched, reared and
fledged to maturity.
I believe that a contributing factor to the intrusions being accepted by
the parent birds and indeed to the inducement of the bird to nest, is the size
of the flight, this being 3.5 m x 4.0 m x 2.2 m high. I am of the opinion
that the height in particular is of great importance in the encouragement of
all my birds to produce positive breeding results.
The foods offered prior to the birds being released into the aviary were
panicum millet, millet spray, mixed millets, soaked seed sprinkled with
Orlux eggfood and an insectivorous food. I also offered a wild seed mix
which was picked over for small seeds.
Once the birds were released into the outside flight livefood was
introduced in the form of aphids, ants and pupae; also a large pile of grass
cuttings generated a considerable number of insects.
Once nesting had started the collection of aphids began, gradually
increasing the supply from once to three or four times daily. These were
collected from nettle beds, taking great care not to damage the nettles so as
to maintain the source. Aphids from pear trees, I have noticed were not
taken and also blackfly were refused.
The adults and independent young spend a lot of time flitting from bush

to bush in a tit-like fashion, I assume looking for insects and small seeds.
Bathing facilities are offered daily and used regularly throughout the
day.
All the offspring have been left with the parents and allowed to fly and
live as a small flock.
From talks with friends who are also trying to breed these birds, I
understand that they have lost individuals due to Candida and liver failure,
which may suggest a dietary problem. The diet apart, I would conclude
that these lively members of the estrildid family will survive and
reproduce in a large planted aviary with a plentiful and varied supply of-
small insects throughout the summer months.
Provided they are not overcrowded and are carefully acclimatised they
should prove, once established, to be hardy. Indeed with due care and
consideration to the position and exposure of their flight, I have
successfully overwintered these birds in the previously mentioned
accommodation without any problems.

The GOLDEN-BREASTED BUNTING Emberiza flaviventris is also
known as the Red-backed Yellow Bunting and Red-backed Bunting. In the
wild it has been observed feeding on seeds of weeds and grass near or on
the ground. The seed of hay Chloris virgata has been recorded. Livefood
consisted of beetles, termites, ants, grasshoppers, crickets, flies and
mantids. In the aviary, they have been recorded feeding on the seeds of
Teff Grass Eragrostis tef, Weeping Love Grass E.curvula, Dew Grass
E.obtusa, Bird-seed Grass Phalciris canariensis, Guinea Grass Panicum
maximum , Blue Panic P.laevifolium and the fruit of the Inkberry Tree
Cestrum leavigatum. Livefood consists of small spiders, mealworms,
thrips-nymphs, springtails, fishmoths, hairless caterpillars and wasp larvae
or &amp;quot;grubs&amp;quot;.
The Golden-breasted Bunting constructs a loosely made, shallow cup-
shaped nest of roots and dry grass lined with fine rootlets and a thin layer:
of animal hair on top of this, placed 45-150cm up in a horizontal fork of a
tree or bush. The breeding season is from October to February in Natal
and the Transvaal, September to March in the eastern Cape Province,
South Africa, and October to December in Zimbabwe. The two to four;
eggs are white, cream, bluish or greenish, spotted, scrolled and pencilled
with black, sepia and ashy grey mainly at the thick end. Egg
measurements average (100) 19.7 x 14.3mm (17.9-23.3 x 13.1-15.2;one
16.6). The nest cup has an external diameter of 5cm and a depth of 3,8cm.
Incubation is by the female and lasts 12.5-13 days; male feeds the female
at the nest; nestling period has been recorded as 16-17 days in the wild, 17
days (1) in an aviary bird.
The LARKLIKE BUNTING Emberiza impetuani has also been called
Lark Bunting, Pale Rock Bunting and African Rock Bunting. In its natural
state it feeds on seeds and insects with green hairless caterpillars and a
butterfly being recorded. In captivity it takes a seed diet with hay Chloris
virgata , Natal Redtop Rhynchelytrum repens , Guinea Grass Panicum
maximum, Weeping Love Grass Eragrostis curvula, Buffaloquick Grass
Paspalum distichum , Garden-setaria Setaria pallide-fusca and fresh cut
Lucerne Medicago sativa having been recorded. Insects and other
arthropods, namely mealworms, hairless caterpillars, thrips-nymphs,
termites, fly larvae or &amp;quot;maggots&amp;quot;, gnats, craneflies, spiders and millipedes
are also eaten.

The Larklike Bunting builds a shallow, but neat cup composed of
coarse sticks and lined with fine grass and rootlets or occasionally with
thistle-down. Nests are built on the ground under, or at the base of a rock
or stone, in shelter of a small shrub or rock ledge on stony ground, less
often in flat, sandy ground. The nest cup has an internal diameter of 5.3-
5.8-6.7cm and a depth of 2.4-2.9-3.9cm (8). This bunting breeds from
September-November in western Cape Province, South Africa, March-
May in Zimbabwe and April-May in Botswana. Two to four, usually three
eggs are laid which are white, greenish white or bluish, spotted and
blotched with red-brown and slate-grey. Egg measurements average (31)
17.5 x 13.5mm (16.0-19.6). Only the female incubated for 13 days in the
wild, 12-13 days (2) in aviary birds. During this period the male feeds the
female on the nest. The young leave the nest at about 12-13 days with
aviary birds at 12-14 days (2).
The ROCK BUNTING Emberiza tahapisi is more commonly known as
the Cinnamon-breasted Rock Bunting and Seven-striped Bunting. It takes
seeds on growing plants such as Love Grass Eragrostis spp. and insects in
the form of beetles, grasshoppers and hairless caterpillars. A small
Melolonthid chafer beetle has also been recorded. Aviary birds have
readily accepted the seeds of hay Chloris virgata, Teff Grass Eragrostis
tef, Berg Grass Setaria appendicuiata, Polo Grass Hyparrhenia cymbaria
and Common Thatch Grass H.hirta. Livefood is taken in the form of
beetle larvae, including mealworms, termites, gnats, fly larvae or
&amp;quot;maggots&amp;quot;, wasp larvae or &amp;quot;grubs&amp;quot;, thrips-nymphs, hairless caterpillars,
spiders, millipedes and small slugs.
The Rock Bunting starts to breed from November-February in the
Transvaal, Orange Free State and Natal provinces of South Africa and
January-June, November-December in Zimbabwe when it constructs a
basin-shaped nest of grass and roots, lined with finer grass and rootlets
placed at the base of a grass tuft, amongst stones, earth bank or in a rock
crevice.
Two to four, usually three eggs are laid. They are white, bluish white or
greenish white, spotted and blotched with red-brown, dark brown and slate
grey. Egg measurements average (41) 17.5 x 13.2mm (16.4-18.6 x 11.9-
14.4). Incubation is by both sexes in the wild for 12-14 days, males
observed not sitting tight in aviary birds (2). Nestling period 14-16 days;
young fed by both parents.
The CAPE BUNTING Emberiza capensis has been given alternative
names such as the Three-streaked Bunting, Cape Rock Bunting and
Southern Rock Bunting. Its diet includes seeds, insects and arthropods
with the red arils of Rooi-krans Acaciacyclops, grasshoppers, beetles,
termites and spiders being recorded. Aviary observations have revealed the

larvae, including mealworms, termites, hairless caterpillars, moths,
fishmoths, grasshoppers, thrips-nymphs, fly larvae or &amp;quot;maggots&amp;quot;, wasp
larvae or &amp;quot;grubs&amp;quot; and spiders.
The Cape Bunting constructs a ragged cup of twigs, roots and grass,
lined with vegetable down, grass and hair, with an internal diameter of
6.2cm and a depth ot 7.7cm. Nests are built on the ground, in a low dense
bush or creeper with a record of one being found in driftwood caught up in
the roots ot a tree after a flood. The breeding season is from October to
March in the Orange Free State, October to November in the Transvaal,
November to April in the eastern Cape Province, South Africa and
November to June in Zimbabwe. Two to five, usually three eggs are laid.
They are white, pale cream, bluish white or greenish white, spotted and
blotched with red-brown, purple and ash-grey. Egg measurements average
(62) 20.3 x 15mm (17.9-23.2 x 13.6-16.4). The incubation and nestling
periods are not recorded in the wild, but in aviary birds incubation is
recorded as 13-14 days (2); nestling period 17-19 days (2); young fed by
both parents.
The CABANIS&amp;apos;S BUNTING Emberiza cabanisi , or to give it its
alternative names Cabanis&amp;apos;s Yellow Bunting, Three-streaked Bunting,
Yellow Bunting and Yellow-bellied Bunting, is recorded as feeding on
seeds, fallen grain, such as millet and rice, and insects notably
grasshoppers and beetles, In the aviary it has been observed feeding on the
seeds of Natal Redtop Rhynchelytrum repens , Natal Panic Panicum
natalense, Guinea Grass P. maximum , mealworms, grasshoppers and
crickets.
The Cabanis s Bunting female builds a loose shallow cup of roots, grass
stems and weed stalks, lined with finer grass and rootlets. It is placed 1-
5m above the ground in a bush or tree. In West Africa it has been recorded
utilising a Yam vine or banana plant. In captivity it has built on the ground
(1). The breeding season is January to March, September to December in
Zimbabwe. Two to three eggs are laid which are usually white or pale
green, scrawled and blotched with brown and grey often around the thick
end. Egg measurements average (11) 20.0 x 14.7 (18-21.9 x 14.1-15.1).
Incubation is by the female, the period of which is not recorded in the
wild, aviary birds 14 days (1); nestling period not recorded in the wild,
aviary birds 16 days (1); young fed by both parents.
Aviary observations of Emberiza have revealed that the legs of
grassnoppers, crickets and mantids are carefully removeu before feeding

to young. Livefood is fed for the first 7-11 days after which seed is added
to their diet. Nest construction is carried out by the female with the male
in constant attendance, following her on nesting material collecting trips.
Males are often seen sitting close to incubating females. Young birds are
fed for a further 8-10 days by the male after leaving the nest. An attempt
to eat dry seed has been observed at 12-15 days after leaving the nest.
Aviary birds will accept a basic of four parts yellow manna, one part red
manna, two parts canary and one part white millet. Fresh washed
greenfood should be supplied regularly in the form of chickweed,
watercress and thistle to complete a good staple diet. Crushed oyster shell
or cuttlefish &amp;apos;bone&amp;apos; will act as a valuable adjunct to grit. Prepacked canary
rearing food mixed with crumbled hard boiled egg is acceptable to adults
feeding young. Branches fixed to the battens of the aviary will encourage
the birds to construct their own nests. Nesting receptacles such as the
wicker canary cup and half-open nest boxes have been utilised in the past.
Nest lining material in the form of hessian, pampas grass plumes, moss,
coconut fibre, animal hair, wool, feathers, string and partly dried weeds
will be adequate.

arrived in San Diego as juvenile birds in May, 1987, and only one pair of
birds successfully nested in 1989. They made their nest in an artificial
basket placed about 10&amp;apos; (3.3m) high in a tree overhanging the water. A
total of eight eggs was laid in two clutches and pulled for artificial
incubation. Three eggs were infertile, one egg was eaten by a Lesser
Adjutant Stork and four eggs were fertile and hatched. Artificial
incubation and hand-rearing is selected in those cases in which the bird
density and species composition in the mixed aviaries places reproductive
efforts of the more valuable species at risk. The eggs were incubated at
99.0 F and 80.0 F wet bulb. The chicks were hatched at 98.5*F and 88 F
wet bulb. The nestling diet consisted of chopped newborn mice and fish
supplemented with chalk and vitamins. Diet was gradually changed to
young mice and larger chunks of fish as the chicks grew.
For all of the mynah species except for the Rothschild&amp;apos;s Mynah,
artificial incubation and hand-rearing was elected with a number of eggs.

Artificial incubation in all cases was done in a Petersime incubator at
100.5 F and 87 F wet bulb. Flatching was done at 99.5*F and 88*-90*F
wet bulb. The variety of nests included English parakeet boxes, artificial
logs formed out of bark, and standard budgerigar boxes. Nesting materials
included grasses, leaves, twigs, palm fibres and fern fronds.
Clutches and incubation periods for each mynah species were noted to
be as follows: Grosbeak (3-5 eggs, incubation=13-15 d), Gold-crested (3-5
eggs, incubation=15 d), Golden-breasted (1-2 eggs, incubation=15-16 d),
White-collared (3-5 eggs, incubation= 14 d), Celebes (2-3 eggs,
incubation=18 d). Nestlings were reared on a diet which consisted of cat-
chow mixed with papaya and apple sauce. Chicks were gradually weaned
onto a diet containing cricket abdomens, hard-boiled egg, newborn mice,
waxworms, mealworms, chopped fruits, bird-of-prey diet, and red-worms.
Of the five species of mynahs, 15 chicks were produced through artificial
incubation. Of these, 12 chicks survived.
The authors would like to acknowledge the hard work and creative
efforts of the keeper staff at both facilities which produced such a
spectacular breeding season. Credit for the 1989 reproductive successes
must go to those dedicated to the keeping of the Society&amp;apos;s animal
collection.

NEW SPECIES OF AMAZON PARROT DESCRIBED

An ornithological discovery of major interest to aviculturists is that of a
new species of Amazon. Amazona kawalli was formally described in
Revista braziliera de biologia (published in Rio de Janeiro) by Grantsau
and Camargo (1989). Their paper suggests that the species was previously
undescribed because it was confused with the Mealy Amazon A.farinosa.
This is indeed the case. A specimen now known to be of kawalli was
exhibited at London Zoo from at least the early 1970s until the mid-1980s
or after. It was labelled as farinosa. (I referred to this bird in the first
edition of Parrots, their care and breeding , p497, in the mistaken belief
that it was mercenaria - a much smaller species).
Amazona kawalli is immediately distinguished from farinosa by the
crescent-shaped area of bare white skin from the cere to the base of the
lower mandible. This feature distinguishes it from all other Amazons. The
cere is dark grey and periorbital skin is light grey. The beak is partly
yellow-horn colour and dark grey on the culmen.
Size and shape are similar to the Mealy Amazon. The authors examined
two living birds and one skin belonging to Nelson Kawall, also the type
female, and compared these with 34 skins of A.f.farinosa from Brazil. In
the latter the culmen length varied from 34mm to 43mm and the wing
length from 126mm to 149mm. In the type female of kawalli the culmen
measured 36mm and in one male 35mm; in the type female the wing
length was 120mm (not stated for the male).
The plumage of kawalli is a more uniform green, compared with
farinosa and without the mealy suffusion. The head is described as
emerald green. Carpal edge of the wing is light yellow-green. The feathers
of the nape and scapulars are margined with black.
The tail is a very distinctive feature of this Amazon. On the lateral
rectrices is a large area of red on the outer web; the tip of the tail is
yellowish-green and the central part of the outer web is dark green. The
wing speculum is scarlet.
Amazona kawalli originates from north-western Brazil in the state of
Amazonas. The type specimen is from the Rio Jurua. The male described
was from Santarem, Para, collected there by Rolf Grantsau in 1970, and
two live birds in the collection of Nelson Kawall are from an area
approximately 100km south of Santarem.

Mr Kawall, in whose honour the species has been named, has almost
certainly kept a large and varied collection of Brazilian parrots for longer
than anyone in Brazil. His interest in mutations is well known and some of
his mutation Aratinga conures have bred to several generations. He has
bred, among others, the Red-tailed Amazon A.brasiliensis and the Queen
of Bavaria&amp;apos;s Conure Aratinga or Guarouba guarouba.
I had the pleasure of visiting him and his wife two years ago in Sao
Paulo and of seeing the then unnamed kawalli in his aviaries. It is a fitting
tribute to a very knowledgeable man that this species should be named
after him. Equally knowledgeable - and surely one of the most prolific
natural history artists who ever lived - is Rolf Grantsau. His illustration of
kawalli accompanies the description.
The authors point out that a photograph of a bird of this species (the
specimen formerly at London Zoo) can be found on pi84 of Enzyklopadie
der Papageien und Sittiche by K. Bosch and U. Wedde.

Many species once frequently imported in this large family have been
less often available since 1980. However, some species seldom imported
or probably imported for the first time, have been advertised occasionally,
usually trom South East Asia and China, and often received as secondary
imports from Europe.
In the genus Turdus few New World species have been imported in
recent years, only Rufous-backed and Rufous-collared Thrushes having
been available. The African Kurrichane and Olive thrushes have also been
occasionally listed. Asiatic members of the genus, have been represented
by the Black-breasted Thrush, Island Thrush, Pale Thrush and Eye-browed
Thrush but the Grey-winged Blackbird, once a fairly frequent import from
the Indian sub-continent, has seldom been available.
Imports ol the genus Zoothera , have included the Asiatic Siberian
Thrush, Orange-headed Thrush, and Chestnut-capped. The Abyssinian
Ground Thrush has also been listed.
The Blue Whistling Thrush, is probably the only species in the genus
Myiophoneus available in recent years. Monticola species imported have
included the Asiatic Blue-capped Rock Thrush. The only African species
listed has been the Angolan Rock Thrush.
The monotypic River Chat, Chaimarronis and Indian Robin,
Saxicoloides fulicata have been imported. Species in other genera, have
included: Saxicola , the White-tailed Stonechat, Pied Bushchat, Jerdon&amp;apos;s
and Grey Bushchats; Cinclidium , the White-tailed Blue Robin, Blue-
fronted and the Sunda Blue Robin, a possible first importation;
</bodyText>
<reference confidence="0.562361444444444">
Rhyacornis, Plumbeous Redstart; Phoenicurus, the Blue-fronted, Daurian,
and White-capped Redstarts.
Three species of Forktail Enicurus have been available, the White-
crowned, Spotted and Little Forktail. It is probable that these species had
not been imported before 1980.
Species imported in Copsychus have included the White-rumped or
Common Shama and on a few occasions, the Rufous-tailed Shama. The
Magpie Robin has also been imported fairly frequently, considering the
reduction of exports from countries of origin.

possibly other species which have been advertised as &amp;quot;Shortwings&amp;quot;.
BOMBYCILLIDAE - WAXWINGS
The Cedar Waxwing has been frequently available in recent years, and
on a few occasions, the Japanese Waxwing, a species probably not
imported before 1980.
LANIIDAE - SHRIKES
Two African species in the genus Lanius have been imported, the
Common Fiscal and the Long-tailed. The Asiatic Bay-backed Shrike and
the Long-tailed, have been available. In Telophorus, the Many-coloured
Bush-Shrike and the Four-coloured; Corvinella the Magpie Shrike;
Malaconotus, the Grey-headed Bush-Shrike; Laniarius, Slate-coloured

IRENIDAE-LEAFBIRDS
The Ioras Aegithina have been represented by the Common Iora and the
Green. Five Leafbird species Chloropsis have been available: the Golden-

The Fairy Bluebird Irena puella has been frequently available during the
last few years. It is interesting to note that this is the only genus in
Irenidae which has been bred in the U.K.
PYCNONOTIDAE-BULBULS
It would appear that more Asiatic Bulbul species have been imported in
recent years, than prior to 1980. This is probably due to shipments from
Hong Kong being collected from a wider geographical area and shipments
received as secondary imports from Europe.
Species in the genus Hypsipetes imported have included the Black
Bulbul, the Ashy, Chestnut, Rufous-bellied and Streaked. In Criniger,

Over one hundred members and their guests gathered at Chestnut Lodge,
Cobham, Surrey, at the kind invitation of Miss Ruth Ezra and Mr
Raymond Sawyer, President and Vice-President of the Avicultural Society.
The weather was warm and sunny and, as ever, the hospitality and the
gardens were superb.
This happy annual event was marred only by the recent death of Harry
Horswell, Honorary Secretary and Treasurer of the Society, who will be
greatly missed by us all.
Every year, as we walk around this internationally famous collection, there
is always something new to see. An addition to the flamingos was a
robust-looking young Caribbean, hatched in the collection. Other breeding
included Avocets, Stilts, Black Crakes, Orinoco Geese, Pintails and
Mandarins. Success with Psittacines included the breeding of Keas,
Philippine Hanging Parrots, Red-flanked Lories, Rosa Bourke. In the
centre garden aviaries, Bay-headed Tanagers and Azure-winged Magpies
were feeding fledged young.
Much admired by the visitors was a magnificent pair of Toco Toucans,
as well as a pair of Spangled Cotinga and a well-coloured flock of Scarlet
Ibis. In a range of recently completed aviaries were housed Green Wood
Hoopoes, White-throated and White-fronted Bee Eaters, Racquet-tailed
Rollers, Touracos, Giant Hummingbirds, White-crowned and Egyptian
Plovers.
In a walk of enclosed aviaries we saw Beautiful, Black-naped, Superb
and Jamboll Fruit Doves, Mrs Gould&amp;apos;s, Splendid, Green-headed and
Scarlet-chested Sunbirds, Royal Starlings and Yellow-fronted
Woodpeckers. On our return to the lawns for tea, we saw birds ranging
from Sun Bitterns to Jay Thrushes and Blue-headed Parrot Finches to
Yellow Grosbeaks. We had our tea while watching Crowned and
Demoiselle Cranes, Oystercatchers and Peruvian Thick-knees on the lawn.
It had been a most enjoyable and interesting day.

giving members such an interesting and enjoyable afternoon. Those of us
who were lucky enough to be able to attend were given a very privileged

I am sure I speak for all members of the Society in expressing our
sadness at the tragic and unexpected death of Harry Horswell, on 25th
April, of cancer.
Harry succeeded Arthur Prestwich as Honorary Secretary and Treasurer
in 1971 and through the years his enthusiasm and generosity have enabled
the Society and the Avicultural Magazine to survive and flourish. It was
never easy as the Society had no financial reserves (this continues to be
our problem today) and there were quite a few occasions when Harry gave
financial assistance. Members may not realise just how much hard work is
involved in the day-to-day running of the Society - collection of
subscriptions, dispatching Magazines and back numbers, organising
meetings and catering, and coping with the very considerable load of
correspondence. For 20 years Harry provided offices, facilities, storage
space and staff to carry on this work, in which he was ably assisted by his
wife Mary Harvey, as Assistant Honorary Secretary. Other members of the
Horswell family have supported the Society over the years, notably
Harry&amp;apos;s daughter Victoria who tragically died a year before her father, also
of cancer.
It is hard to believe that Harry is no longer with us but his wit, his
cheerful friendliness and hospitality will always be a happy memory for
his many friends all over the world. It is a measure of his contribution to
the Society that the Avicultural Magazine is flourishing today and enjoys
such international prestige and support.
Before he died Harry knew that Bristol Zoo was going to take over the
management of the Avicultural Society and it pleased him very much to
know that this historic society, to which he had given so much, would be
in safe hands and would continue to prosper. We are indeed fortunate that
Mr. Geoffrey Greed, Director of Bristol Zoo, has taken on this
considerable task and I do appeal to all members to support him.

Aviculturists suffered a grievous loss with the death of Harry Horswell
who contributed markedly to the well-being of the Avicultural Society of
which he was Honorary Secretary and Treasurer for many years and for
which he worked very hard. He was responsible not only for the routine
running of the Society&amp;apos;s affairs but also for the organisation of most of its
social events at which his charm, sense of humour and infectious
cheerfulness contributed greatly to their success. He was a generous and
excellent host and always very good company. His goodnatured opinions
at council meetings and delightful presence at the Society&amp;apos;s Social
functions will be long remembered.
He was very modest about his practical activities as an aviculturist and
often insisted that he &amp;quot;didn&amp;apos;t know very much about birds&amp;quot;. Of course, this
was far from the truth. His avicultural interests ranged widely and many
beginners are grateful for his practical advice, encouragement and genuine
appreciation of their achievements however minor. His avicultural
i activities flourished in a big way at Sladmore Farm, near High Wycombe,
where he established a large collection of waterfowl, built an excellent
range of aviaries and created a beautiful tropical enclosure which housed
such rarities as Umbrella Birds and Giant and Swallow-tailed Humming
Birds. He was successful in breeding many species of parakeet including
the Princess of Wales and the Crimson-winged, Barn Owls, Blue and
Yellow Macaws and, more remarkably, Hoopoes and Purple Guans.
Perhaps his most notable breeding success occurred with Chilean
Flamingos when his group of six produced a chick despite the experts&amp;apos;
insistence that successful breeding may be achieved only in very large
colonies.
Subsequently, he concentrated on waterfowl at Ascot and on rare and
attractive softbills, like Royal Starlings, at Hartley Witney.
Harry was a well known art expert and, at the Sladmore Gallery, which
he owned, he promoted the work of many wildlife artists several of whom
owe their success to his interest, encouragement and support. Some of
their work, including that of David Reid-Henry, David Digby and Brian

It will not be toigotten that it was Harry&amp;apos;s enthusiasm and generosity,
supported by his wife Mary, that ensured continuity of the society from
when he took over in 1971.
We shall always remember Harry for the special flair that he brought to
meetings. These were so much enhanced by his wit and charm, and made
such enjoyable occasions for those attending.
Dulcie and Freddie Cooke
It was with great sadness that I heard of Harry Horswell&amp;apos;s death after
much suffering. We had known one another for many years through the
Avicultural Society. He was a hard worker for the Society and enjoyed
meeting the bird enthusiasts.
His cheerfulness and friendliness will be very much missed by us all.
He had many interests including his art galleries and wildlife artists. He
was always a very busy person - remarkable in every venture.

have not been published elsewhere and that essentially concern the avi-

natural history. Articles should be preferably typewritten, with double
spacing, and the scientific names as well as the vernacular names of birds
should be given. References cited in the text should be listed at the end

the article will be used where possible and should be clearly captioned. If
authors wish their eventual return, they must say so when submitting the
article and write their name on the back of each photograph.
