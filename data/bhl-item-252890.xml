The Monograph of the Pheasants by D.G. Elliot (1872) is
probably the finest of all illustrated bird books, but readers of
Palmer's Life of Wolf will remember his excitement on discovering
in Wolfs studio the original charcoal drawings for the plates.
These have a vivid quality of life of which much was lost when
they were transferred to lithographic stones by Smit and Keule-
mans. These drawings form the basis of the present work. They
are accompanied by fine coloured reproductions, somewhat
reduced in size, of the 79 plates in the monograph and a condensed
version of Elliot's text.
An extensive introduction by David Lank examines the history
and production of the work.
A prospectus is available.

group of birds, or that describe their natural history. Articles should be preferably
typewritten, with double spacing, and the scientific names as well as the vernacular
names of birds should be given. References cited in the text should be listed at the
end of the article. Line drawings should be in Indian ink on thick paper or card;
black and white photographs which illustrate a particular point in the article will be
used where possible and should be clearly captioned. If authors wish their eventual
return, they must say so when submitting the article and write their name on the

A REVIEW OF THE 1985 BREEDING SEASON
By ROGER WILKINSON
(Curator of Birds)

Whereas the summer of 1984 was exceptionally dry and sunny, that of
cold 1985 never really arrived. Indeed, the spring and summer months
were cold and exceptionally wet. This affected our breeding season, es-
pecially with respect to some species of paddock birds and parrakeets.
The first birds to lay (in fact eggs were laid in late December 1984)
were the Cereopsis Geese Cereopsis novaehollandiae. As usual, the first
clutch of eggs was removed for artificial incubation, but as has happened
all too frequently, none was reared. Only one gosling has been reared
from this pair in five seasons; we have tried both artificial incubation and
parent incubation but all but one gosling have died either prior to
hatching or as weak goslings shortly after hatching. It would appear that
our only option may be to try different pairings - the problem is an un-
derstandable reluctance of other parties to enter into exchanges with
either of this problem pair.
The Black Swans Cygnus atratus also lay their first clutch in late winter/
early spring. As is our normal practice, the first clutch was removed for
artificial incubation and two cygnets were successfully reared. The parents
did even better in rearing six cygnets from their second clutch and later in
the year we were able to send five immature Swans to start a new colony
at Whipsnade Zoo. Our recently acquired Red-breasted Geese Branta rufi-
collis and Hawaiian Geese Branta sandvicensis were probably still too
young to lay and other species may have been inhibited by the extremely
cold spring weather. However, we were successful with Laysan Teal Anas
platyrhynchos laysanensis and Mandarin Ducks Aix galericulata , two spe-
cies of waterfowl which are rare in their native habitats but are now both well

established in captivity. Eleven Laysan Teal and 24 Mandarin Ducks were
reared as well as good numbers of Carolina Ducks Aix sponsa, Rosy-billed
Pochard Netta peposaca and Chiloe Wigeon Anas sibilatrix.
Ratites were far less successful than in 1984. Owing to the foul cold
weather, the earliest laid Ostrich Struthio camelus eggs were removed for
artificial incubation. Five Ostriches hatched but only two survived. Both
of these had very slow growth rates compared to those of the previous
year. After trying our female Emu Dromaius novaehollandiae with two
different males we still await any signs of breeding activity and I am
beginning to wonder whether, in fact, we do have a true pair. Ratites,
other than Ostriches, can be quite difficult to sex and do not always
follow the text book patterns. We obtained two young Rheas Rhea ameri-
cana, considered females, from Colwyn Bay Zoo in late 1984. These were
placed with our proven male and both coloured up very well to such an
extent that one of our staff thought them both to be males. This was
happily proved not to be the case when eggs were discovered in their
paddock. Although normally we would allow the male to incubate these
eggs (in Rheas as in Emus the males incubate and care for the chicks),
because these birds shared a paddock with the Guanacos Lama guanicoe
we decided to play safe by removing the eggs for artificial incubation,
and nine chicks were successfully reared. This number was only eclipsed
by the Rhea's diminutive near-relative, the Chilean Timmou Nothoprocta
perdicaria whose prolificity resulted in some 36 chicks being hatched, of
which the majority was reared to maturity.
Staying with paddock birds, we await successes with cranes and flamin-
gos. For the first time our Demoiselle Cranes Anthropoides virgo laid two
eggs which, however, proved infertile. The Chilean Phoenicopterns chilen-
sis and Caribbean Flamingos Phoenicop terns ruber ruber built nests and
several pairs were frequently observed together displaying. Copulations
were frequently observed but no eggs resulted.
A large outdoor flight holds a mixed group of herons and ibises. Night
Herons Nycticorax nycticorax, Sacred Ibis Threskiomis aethiopica, Straw-
necked Ibis Threskiomis spinicollis and Little Egret Egretta garzetta all
nested. A Little Egret was reared, we think for the first time at Chester,
the male parent being on loan from Rode Tropical Bird Gardens. Sacred
Ibis also successfully reared chicks, but the Night Heron's chicks dis-
appeared shortly after hatching and the Straw-necked Ibis's eggs failed
to hatch.
Our Penguins Spheniscus humboldti are not good parents. Whilst per-
haps six pairs went to nest, only one chick was reared to maturity.
Wooden boxes are now being used in the Penguin Enclosure. Whilst not
as 'natural' as the nesting burrows the birds have previously used, these

boxes should allow inspection and greater control over breeding activity.
One major problem with the old nest burrows was the difficulty in actually
recording what was happening in the breeding season; in the future we
intend to remove eggs shortly before hatching, or remove recently hatched
chicks and hand-rear these.
Perhaps our most significant breeding in 1985 was the hand-rearing of a
female Andean Condor Vultur gryphus . The parent birds did extremely
well early in the season in incubating and hatching a young male Condor.
Sadly, this disappeared a week after hatching (probably eaten by one of
the parents, the male smashed both eggs the previous year), and we resolved
to remove the next egg for artificial incubation. After two months in the
incubator we were rewarded with the hatching of a female Condor (the
Andean Condors can be sexed on hatching as the males already have the
fleshy comb characteristic of their sex). The hard work then began. For a
period of three months one of our keepers shared his bedroom with the
young Condor so that he was able to give it day and night attention. We
had one very worrying period when the Condor rapidly lost weight follow-
ing an infection possibly contracted as a result of switching from its rat
diet (at one stage it was taking the entrails and best leg meat from 24 rats a
day) to a rabbit diet. Had it not been for the keeper's attention and enthu-
siasm we would surely have lost the Condor in this very crucial period.
Happily the Condor is now back in the Zoo.
The Spectacled Owls Pulsatrix perspicillata laid fertile eggs again this
year but unfortunately the clutch was deserted part way through incuba-
tion. The chilled eggs were transferred to an incubator and although one
very weak chick managed to pip the shell, it died within hours of being
helped out of the egg. Snowy Owls Nyctea scandiaca reared two chicks for
the second year running and a new pair of European Eagle Owls Bubo
bubo also produced two strong, healthy young.
We were both pleased and disappointed with our Great Indian Horn-
bills Buceros bicornis. Pleased because after only being together a matter
of months, this pair went to nest and laid two eggs. Disappointed because
after artificially hatching the abandoned eggs following the female break-
ing out of her nest chamber, we were unsuccessful in hand-rearing the
two chicks.
Considering the birds in the Bird House and adjacent Arcade, we were
successful in rearing Spreo Starlings Spreo superbus from two different
pairs and also had young from the Crowned Plovers Vanellus coronatus
occupying the ground space of the same aviaries. The Blacksmith's Plovers
Vanellus armatus , which we have had since 1979, responded to their
move to the central inside aviary of the Bird House by nesting for the

first time. Perhaps the running water stimulated them. Whatever the
reason, we hatched a total of seven young,of which three were success-
fully reared. Palawan Peacock Pheasants Polyplectron emphanum and
Grey Peacock Pheasants Polyplectron bicalcaratum were also bred, remov-
ing the first clutches for artificial incubation and leaving the later ones for
the parents to rear. Two Kookaburras Dacelo novaeguineae were reared by
our youngest inexperienced pair but the older pair again failed. Two San
Bias Jays Cissilopha sanblasiana were fledged, of which one later suc-
cumbed to gape worms Syngamus. Birds of the crow and starling family
are particularly susceptible to this parasite which is ubiquitous in popula-
tions of wild British Starlings and Crows.
Red-billed Magpies Urocissa erythrorhyncha and Red-headed Laughing
Thrushes Garrulax erythrocephalus nested but neither had chicks. Coleto
Mynahs Sarcops calvus and Common Mynahs Acridotheres tristis were
hatched but neither species managed to rear their young to maturity. The
Crested Bronzewing Pigeons Ocyphaps lophotes, however, were excep-
tionally prolific, one pair rearing seven chicks in a succession of clutches,
the last of which were hatched on Christmas Day.
The breeding of Pallas's Sandgrouse Syrrhaptes paradoxus has been
reported in the Avicultural Magazine (1986, No. 3: 121). Several clutches
of eggs were laid but the parents failed to show any signs of incubation
behaviour. The eggs were, therefore, removed and artificially incubated.
Four chicks hatched of which two were successfully reared.
The Finch Flight Aviary holds a mixed collection of birds including
Chilean Tinamous and parrakeets as well as finches and waxbills. The
Mexican House Finches Carpodacus mexicanus were embarrassingly
successful to the extent that we have had difficulties in finding homes
for all the progeny; a total of 19 House Finches were reared. The Splen-
did Parrakeets Neophema splendida housed in the same aviary reared
eight young in two broods.
Yellow-billed Amazons Amazona collaria hatched but failed to rear
chicks and we hope to attempt hand-rearing this species in the coming
breeding season. The Slender-billed Parrakeets Enicognathus leptorhyn-
chus were more successful in rearing four of the total of six chicks hatched.
Other notable breedings of parrot-like birds included two Red-sided Eclec-
tus Eclectus roratus polychlorus , two Derbyan Parrakeets Psittacula
derbiana, eight Maroon-tailed Conures Pyrrhura melanura, four Yellow-
faced Parrotlets Forpus xanthops and 15 Lesser Patagonian Conures
Cyanoliseus patagonus. The latter included one yellow variant which we
were able to exchange for two female Hawk-headed Parrots Deroptyus
accipitrinas. Our present pair of Hawk-headed Parrots had proved on
surgical sexing to be two males. Happily we now have two true pairs - all

four birds have been surgically sexed. The Barraband Parrakeets Poly-
tells swaimoni and Crimson-winged Parrakeets Aprosmictus erythropterus
hatched chicks but neither species managed to rear these in the cold wet
spring.
The rearing of two Lesser Vasa Parrots Coracopsis nigra was reported in
a previous issue (1985, No. 4:189). Lesser Vasas have become one of our
favourite parrots; although sombre in colour, this is more than made up
for bv their engaging behaviour and most un-parrot-like musical songs.Our
other main joy was in the hand-rearing of two Blue-eyed Cockatoos Caca-
tua opthalmica. The Blue-eyed Cockatoos hatched but failed to rear a
single young in 1984, and the first clutch of 1985 disappeared before
hatching. We therefore decided to remove their second clutch for artificial
incubation. Both eggs hatched and the chicks were hand-reared.
In the free flight of the Tropical House, birds reared included a Fairy
Bluebird Irena puella, six Red-cowled Cardinals Paroria dominicana and a
Purple Glossy Starling Lamprotornis purpureus. This very natural area
gives the false impression of being Ideal for breeding birds. Sadly the nat-
uralisation of the area includes natural hazards, both biotic in terms of
interference and predation by other bird species, and physical - especially
the large number of water areas which appear particularly attractive to
fledgling birds. Thus both Long-tailed Glossy Starlings Lamprotornis
caudatus and Red-backed Mousebirds Colius castanotus fledged young but
these were not reared to independence. Other species that made nesting
attempts in the free-flight included Wagler's Oropendola Psarocolius wag -
leri, Baya Weavers Ploceus philippinis and Red-eared Bulbuls Pycnonotus
jocosus.
The Fire-tufted Barbets Psilopogon pyrolophus , which we bred for the
first time at Chester in 1984, hatched but failed to rear a single chick early
in 1985. This pair laid again in late 1985 from which clutch two chicks
successfully fledged in early 1986. Both are now at London Zoo.
Whilst we had our fair share of unsuccessful nesting attempts, the ex-
tremely hard work of our bird keepers (and the Animal Breeding Centre
Staff who were constantly pestered for live food) resulted in over 200 birds
of more than 40 species being successfully reared in 1985. Although our
most notable event may have been the first United Kingdom breeding of
the Lesser Vasa Parrot, 1985 will perhaps be best remembered for the
hand-rearing of our first Andean Condor at Chester Zoo.

By Dr. T. WEBBER and Dr. J. A. COX
(Florida State Museum, University of Florida, Gainesville, Fla.32611, USA)
Scrub Jays are noisy, colourful and conspicuous North American
corvids. Adults have a blue crown, nape, wings and tail, and a blue band
across the chest; the rest of the plumage is greyish brown to greyish white.
Young Scrub Jays have brown head feathers until about the end of their
first summer. Adults are about 30 cm long and weigh about 75 to 95 g.
Scrub Jays are common in oak woodlands and chaparral of Mexico and
the south-western United States, where together there are 17 recognised
subspecies (Pitelka, 1951; American Ornithologists' Union, 1957). The
Florida Scrub Jay A.c. coerulescens lives in scattered patches of oak scrub
on the peninsula of Florida, more than 1600 km from the nearest south-
western Scrub Jays. Because much of their habitat has been destroyed,
Florida Scrub Jays are now gone from much of the range they occupied
in historic times (Cox 1984) and are classified as 'Threatened' by the
Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission (1981).
For many years, ornithologists considered the Florida Scrub Jay to be
a species distinct from the Scrub Jays of the west (e.g. Baird et al, 1858;
American Ornithologists' Union, 1931), but the prevailing view now is that
all Scrub Jays make up a single species (e.g. Pitelka, 1951; American Orni-
thologists' Union, 1983).
Scrub Jays give a great variety of calls, which can be harsh or musical,
loud or quiet. These calls also differ from place to place. For instance, it
appears that the jays in southern California do not share some of their
commonest loud calls with the jays of Florida (Fig. la-c). Like many other
corvids (Goodwin, 1976), Scrub Jays also have a song, called 'warbling
song' by Barbour (1977). This song (Fig. Id) is a series of varied grating
and melodious sounds that resembles somewhat the song of a Brown
Thrasher Toxostoma rufum, or, even more, that of a juvenile Northern
Mockingbird Mimus polyglottos learning to sing. The Jay's song, though,
is uttered so softly that it can seldom be heard more than five metres
away. For this reason, we prefer to call it the 'whisper song'. Wild Scrub
Jays often sing the whisper song during courtship (Barbour, 1976; pers.
obs.), when they are within about 30 cm of one another. They do not
use it to advertise their territories.
Scrub Jays are monogamous, and the pairs live on permanent territories.

Young southwestern Scrub Jays leave their natal territories in their first
summer, and some breed when they are one year old (Brown, 1974; At-
wood, 1980; Carmen, 1982). Young Florida Scrub Jays remain without
breeding for up to six years (though usually one or two) on their natal
territories, where they help to feed and defend their younger siblings
(Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick, 1984).
Scrub Jays are seldom kept in captivity. From 1976 to 1984 we were
fortunate to keep more than two dozen Scrub Jays, of four subspecies:
superciliosa, oocleptica, and ohscura from California, and coerulescens
from Florida.

Most of our jays had been caught as fledglings or nestlings, some of
which had been rescued from nests that had blown down, or that for some
reason had been brought to humane organisations. Others we trapped as
adults. Once, we captured a family consisting of mother, father, and
nestling, and transferred the group intact, nest and all, to one of our
aviaries, where the parents reared the young bird to independence.
Aviaries. Our two aviaries had earthen floors, concrete-block founda-
tions set about 0.3 m into the ground, and wooden frames 2.0 to 2.5 m
high. One aviary was L-shaped, 4 m long on a side and covered with
l A in (0.6 cm) hardware cloth. The other was rectangular, 5 x 13 m, and
covered with Vi in (1.25 cm) hardware cloth. We sometimes divided the
larger aviary into sections with temporary partitions. The two aviaries
were about 1 m apart; we connected them with a 0.3 m-diameter tube
of hardware cloth, with a removable cover at each end. We made nest
platforms of hardware cloth, about 20 cm square, with sides about 5 cm
high, and fastened them in corners of the aviaries at heights of 1-2 m.
For nest foundations we provided oak twigs about 30 cm long and
about 3 mm in diameter. For the lining we provided fibres from the
leaves of scrub cabbage palm Sobol etonia. These are the same nest mat-
erials that wild Florida Scrub Jays use.
Food. We fed adults on Purina High-Protein Dog Chow, and occasion-
ally peanuts, sunflower seeds and acorns. In 1977 we experimented with a
variety of nestling foods. The parents would not feed dead food to the
young, even if it was of a type they themselves ate. The adults ate a few
live honeybee Apis mellifera larvae but would not feed them to their
young. We provided fly larvae reared on rotting meat but the parents
would not eat them or give them to the young. After 1977 we provided as
nestling food only mealworms ( Tenebrio beetle larvae), which we gave in
abundance from the day the young hatched, a few crickets, and occasion-
ally a variety of wild-caught insects.

Behaviour in captivity
Though only two of the jays were tame enough to take food from our
hands while we were in the aviary, several others would take food from us
if we passed it to them through the mesh from outside. The wildest jays
were those caught after they had acquired their blue head feathers.
Like corvids of many kinds in the wild (Goodwin, 1976), our captives
stored part of their food, burying it in the dirt floor or wedging it into
crevices in the frame of the aviary. They spent much of their time recover-
ing stored food and hiding it again.
The jays often bathed during the warmest part of the day, and one
female and her two successive mates seemed to imitate one another in
choosing a particular time to bathe. They often went for hours without
seeming to pay attention to their water dish, but when one began to
bathe the other took immediate notice and often began to bathe as well
within a few minutes, sometimes within a few seconds, Once for .example,
the male began bathing when his mate was absorbed in uncovering food
on a part of the aviary floor where she could not see him; when he started
splashing she stopped foraging, hopped up to a vantage point where she
watched him for a while, and then went directly to another water dish
where she bathed. We saw the male bathe first 12 times; eight times the
female followed suit within five minutes. The female bathed first eight
times; three times the male also bathed within five minutes. We do not
have enough information to say whether our other jays seemed to imi-
tate one another this way.
Lacking real territories to defend and not seeing many predators, our
captives did not call as often as wild jays do. Like wild jays, they sang the
whisper song during courtship, and we also saw subordinates sing briefly
after they turned away from a dominant jay that had just supplanted
them. Certain inanimate sounds, such as those made by trucks, aeroplanes,
and the wind, stimulated the jays to sing, even if they were perched
quietly alone. It was hard to tape-record the song because it is so quiet
and because the jays sang so unpredictably, but we did have some success
by turning on the tape recorder whenever a large trash truck pulled into
a driveway across the street. When they sang, our jays sometimes imita-
ted the songs of Red-winged Blackbirds Agelaius phoeniceus and Rufous-
sided Towhoes Pipilo erythroph thalmus , as well as the whistling sound that
a Mourning Dove's Zenaida macroura wings make upon take-off.
Pair formation. Scrub Jays in the wild can form pairs in any season of
the year (Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick, 1984). Four times in the spring and
once in the fall, we placed together two jays of opposite sex in an aviary
separated from the other jays. In one pair, created in the spring, the female
had been caught as an adult and never became well-accustomed to capti-

vity. We saw little courtship activity between these two jays, and they
never nested. The jays of the other four pairs had been caught as nestlings
or fledglings. In these pairs courtship included chases, display flights
accompanied by loud calling, and courtship feeding, which often consisted
of passing such small objects as rocks rather than pieces of food. In general
this behaviour resembled that of the wild Scrub Jays we have watched in
California.
We were able to watch the process of pair formation most closely in a
pair we established in the autumn. On 28th October 1978 we placed to-
gether two two-year-old Florida Scrub Jays. The female, whose mate had
died three days before, had bred in 1977 and 1978. The new male, the
brother of the female's former mate, had not bred before. When we put
the two together, the male flew back and forth across the aviary in minia-
ture renditions of a wild Scrub Jay's display flights, while calling loudly.
He also attacked the female so violently that we separated the two by
closing a hardware cloth door in a partition dividing the aviary. The next
day the male seemed less hostile to the female but for safety's sake we
kept the partition closed. As soon as the male was calm enough for the
female to get his attention she sang to him while she crouched facing him
at a distance of less than 20 cm, and passed food to him through the
mesh. On the 30th we opened the door between the two. At first they
sat quietly a few metres apart without seeming to pay attention to one
another. Thereafter the male sometimes chased the female and, less often,
even attacked her, but for the most part his dominance consisted of
supplanting her over a foraging site on the ground or at the food box.
After the 29th we saw the female sing to the male only twice, both
times without facing him after he approached her. The male approached
and sang to her seven times from the 29th to 18th November.
We first saw the male feed the female on 7th November. He fed her
often in the following weeks but many times she tried to evade the feed-
ings by hopping or flying away, &lt;or if she was cornered, by trying to keep
her bill out of the male's reach. When the male succeeded in passing
something to her, she often put it down immediately. Once the male
passed the same rock to the female 20 times in fewer than 15 minutes.
The female rarely fed the male after he started feeding her regularly.
When she did, it was almost always when he was sunbathing, or when he
was fluffed and engrossed in preening after a bath. When the male was
occupied in this way he seemed not to notice the female until she pushed
the object into his bill, and to our eyes he appeared startled.
On 14th November we saw the first of many 'incomplete' feeding
attempts by the male. These episodes resembled normal feedings in all
ways except that when the male came to within about 20 cm of the
female, he stopped and swallowed or dropped the object that he was

carrying, even if the female begged for it with drooped and quivering
wings. Complete feedings became rarer and incomplete ones commoner
until by 21st November all of the feedings were incomplete. By 24th
November the male no longer made even these incomplete attempts at
feeding. The two jays then seemed to be an established pair.
Nesting . Aside from the one pair that included a female caught as an
adult, all of our paired birds nested when we provided nest material in
the spring. They made a total of nine nesting attempts.
The jays first showed interest in nesting by carrying sticks about and
dropping them, without taking them to the nest platform. Florida Scrub
Jays in the wild pull nest sticks directly from bushes and do not pick them
up off the ground (Woolfenden, 1973), but our jays used the sticks we
scattered on the floors of their aviaries. We usually saw the first signs of
nesting activity in early to mid-March,
Wild Florida Scrub Jays do not re-use nests or nest sites (Woolfenden,
1973). Our jays always used the nest platforms we provided except for
once when we left a platform where a pair had nested in it the previous
year. This pair refused to use the platform a second time and instead built
a nest foundation, without a lining (for we had not yet given them palm-
etto fibres), atop a door frame in the aviary. The female laid two eggs,
which did not hatch. We then moved the nest platform to a new location
and gave the jays plenty of nest material, including lining. Before the male
started budding on the new platform, he spent some time placing lining,
but not sticks, on top of the door frame. It was as though this bird, unable
to complete the second phase of nest-building in its first attempt, now had
to go through this phase of behaviour before it could begin a second
attempt.
The jays we watched most closely during nest-building were two Flori-
da yearlings who nested hi 1977. Yearling Florida Scrub Jays do not breed
in the wild, apparently because they are unable to get breeding territories
of their own (Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick, 1984). The male of this pair
built almost all of the nest foundation, and even drove the female away
when she tried to put sticks on the platform. After the male finished the
foundation the female gradually played a greater part in construction and
by the time they added the last of the nest lining the female contributed as
much as the male did. During the last stages of nest construction, the jays
at the nest seemed to compete for the opportunity to add material. A jay
sitting in the nest would try to grab the material brought by its mate, who
tried to add the material itself. Sometimes a jay grasped the head or tail
feathers of its sitting mate or ran the sitter's back feathers through its bill.
This is as close as any of the jays came to allopreening. Other species of
co-operatively-breeding jays allopreen commonly (Hardy, 1974).

The two yearlings took 19 days to finish their only nest, which they
began in mid-March. Other jays (all older), nesting later in the season, com-
pleted nests in as little as four days.
Our jays laid eggs in all nine of their nesting attempts. Females usually
laid one egg per day. The mean size of the completed clutches was 4.1.
The yearling Florida female laid the smallest clutch, of two, and a seven-
year old of the race oocleptica laid the largest, of six. Incubation lasted
about 18 days, about the same as for wild Florida Scrub Jays (Woolfenden,
1978).
One nesting failed during incubation because the breeding jays were
too close to the other birds, who were on the other side of a semi-opaque
partition. The jays on both sides spent much of their time trying to attack
one another, and the disruption was so great that the female stopped incu-
bating. This pair nested successfully when we moved them to another
aviary 3 m from the other jays and out of their view.
The jays produced nestlings in four of their nine nesting attempts, and
fledglings in two. We lost three nestlings to snakes - probably Yellow Rat
Snakes Elaphe ohsoleta , which are common around buildings, and which
we know ate at least one of our adults. Rodents burrowed into the aviaries
and the snakes followed the burrows.
The yearling Florida Scrub Jays' only nestling died on day 10 (we fol-
low Woolfenden [1978] in calling the day of hatching day 1), probably
because we had not yet found the right nestling food. We then took down
the nest and nest platform. The parents scolded and attacked us if we ap-
proached the empty corner where the nest had been, but almost ignored us
if we held the nest while standing at the opposite end of the aviary, about
4 m from the former nest site.
We had only one mixed pair, a two-year-old female of the race super-
ciliosa and a five-year-old male of the race coerulescem. In their second
nesting of 1981 they produced five eggs, of which one hatched. To mini-
mise disturbance of the female, we weighed the nestling only three times;
each time it weighed about 10 g more than the average for wild Florida
Scrub Jays of the same age (Woolfenden, 1978). It fledged on day 20,
about two days later than is usual for wild Florida Scrub Jays (Woolfenden,
1978). After it fledged we gradually reduced the amount of live food
provided until by about day 50 it was able to eat the same food we provi-
ded for the adults.
The hybrid resembled superciliosa rather than coerulescem in at least
two ways: its plumage was deep cobalt blue rather than pale aquamarine,
and it had a distinct white stripe (which had been apparent even in its
juvenal plumage) over the eye. The only call we heard it give, other than
the usual begging sounds, was essentially the same as the one shown in

We found the hybrid and its mother dead of an unknown cause on the
same day in late November 1981. Study skins of the two birds are now in
the collection of the Florida State Museum (hybrid male: UF 20753;
mother: UF 20754). By the age at which the hybrid died, a California
Scrub Jay could well be mated and established on a breeding territory
(Webber, pers. obs.). Partridge (1966) bred Scrub Jays of the race calif ar-
nica in captivity, but to our knowledge this is the first instance of captive
breeding by superciliosa or coerulescens , and the only time that coerules-
cens and one of the western races have hybridised.

With the death of Arthur Prestwich at the age of 85 on 20th January
1987, the Avicultural Society has lost one of its longest serving and most
devoted members.
Arthur Alfred Prestwich joined the Avicultural Society in 1928 and,
apart from the period 1931 to 1943, remained a member of the Society
until his death. He served as a Council Member from 1946-48, as Honorary
Secretary and Treasurer from 1949 to 1970, Vice President from 1964-
1967, President from 1968-1972, and Honorary Vice President from 1972
to 1987. He was awarded the President's Medal in March 1960.
Throughout his long association with the Avicultural Society, Arthur
Prestwich contributed many interesting articles to the Avicultural Maga-
zine , which reflected his great knowledge of aviculture and ornithology,
and skill as a writer and researcher. As well as a large number of full
articles, a great output of smaller contributions and notes came from the
pen of 'A.A.P.'.
Although Arthur Prestwich's interest extended to all branches of
natural science, birds and especially members of the parrot family were
his great passion. At Kents Farm, near Southampton, in North London
and later at Galleys Wood, near Edenbridge in Kent, he maintained varied
collections of birds, of which parrots formed the major part. The Avicul-
tural Society Medal was awarded to him for the first breedings in Great
Britain of the following species: Lineolated Parrakeet Bolborhynchus
lineola lineola 1953, Guiana Brown-throated Conure Aratinga pertinax

chrysophrys 1955, Red-faced Lovebird Agapomis pullaria 1956, Green
Imperial Pigeon Ducula aenea 1957, and the Lemon Dove Aplopelia lar-
vata 1958. Many other rare birds were kept and bred, and regularly re-
ported upon in the Avicultural Magazine. These reports were usually
written by the late Miss Kay Bonner (Mrs. Prestwich).
Between 1950 and 1954 Arthur Prestwich produced his detailed
Records of Parrots Bred in Captivity which occupied seven parts, and
has provided a basic reference for research in the parrot family in cap-
tivity ever since. Arthur Prestwich's other important publications inclu-
ded: Who&amp;apos;s Who in Aviculture (1929), Records of Parrot-like Birds Bred
in the USA (1949 )Jieleve des Psittacides eleves en France (1950), Rec-
ords of Birds of Prey Bred in Captivity (1950, 2nd edition 1955) and
English Names of the Parrots (1970). Probably his most popular book
was I name this Parrot (1958, revised edition 1963), a fascinating col-
lection of biographical sketches of people in whose honour species of
parrot have been named.
Arthur Prestwich was instrumental in founding The British Avicul-
turists' Club, which between 1946 and 1973 was largely responsible for
the Avicultural Society's social functions. Many important guests atten-
ded, and lectured at the B.A.C. dinners, and much of the success of over
one hundred meetings was due to Arthur Prestwich's initiative and drive
as Secretary-Treasurer.
The Avicultural Society owes a great deal to Arthur Prestwich, es-
pecially for his tremendous work as Honorary Secretary and Honorary
Treasurer during the 1950s and 1960s. Although he had in recent years
suffered ill health, and had been unable to take an active part in the
Society's work, he will be fondly remembered as a great aviculturist and
officer of the Society.

The Society has been presented with Arthur PrestwielTs first breeding
medals by his daughter. These will be displayed at our next meeting and
kept in the Society's archives.
Arthur Prestwick was a tremendous help to me when I took over from
him as Honorary Secretary and Treasurer and it is impossible to under-
estimate the amount of work he did to keep the Society going through all
those difficult years.
H.J. Horswell
I joined the Avicultural Society in 1949 and have served for many years
on its Council. I would like to add my appreciation of all the work that
Arthur Prestwich did for the Society and in doing so I should mention
Kay Bonner (Mrs. Prestwich) who served as Assistant Honorary Secretary
from 1950-1970. Kay predeceased Arthur by some two years. We owe
them both a great debt of gratitude for the contribution they made to the
life and work of our Society.
R.C.J. Sawyer " Vice President
I had not seen Arthur Prestwich for 25 years although we used to ex-
change Christmas cards until recently.
My happiest memories of him were during the post war years when he
organised the diners' club and we used to have those marvellous dinners
at the Rembrandt Hotel which were attended by many avicultural celeb-
rities as guests of honour. Later these were transferred to the Windsor
Hotel but rising costs gradually put paid to such activities. 1 tremble to
think what such occasions would cost today!
Arthur at that time maintained a very fine collection of parrots and I
had the privilege of visiting this on at least one occasion. I think he was
the first to breed the Red-faced Lovebird, if I remember rightly.
He was a good friend with a great sense of humour but he would
not put up with any nonsense and his tongue could be sharp at times. It
is to my regret that we gradually lost touch after I moved to the West
Country and he moved further east into Kent. London seems to act as an
invisible barrier between East and West.

REPAIRING EGG FRACTURES OF THE
ABYSSINNIAN GROUND HORNBILL Bucorvus abysinnicus

Aviculturists have always experienced a wide variety of problems with
artificial incubation. Apart from problems involving different incubation
parameters of exotic birds, occasionally mishaps occur resulting in egg
fractures. These accidents can be the result of clumsy birds in the nest
or a well-intentioned aviculturist mishandling an egg.
Abysinnian Ground Hornbills are a terrestrial species in the family
Bucerotidae. Their habitat ranges from Gambia eastward through Camer-
oon, Sudan, Ethiopia into northern Kenya.
They are large birds measuring 117 cm in length and their plumage
and casque bill is black; the facial skin is a deep blue; sexually mature
males have a red gular pouch. Females are similar but lack the red pig-
mentation.
At the San Diego Wild Animal Park we have gained a great deal of
experience with this species, hatching 39 chicks since 1972. Our wild-
caught pair successfully hatched a chick for which we received the Edward
Bean Award (created to recognise notable hatchings or births) presented
by the American Association of Zoos, Parks and Aquariums.
Manipulating or removing eggs can be done for a number of reasons:
inexperienced parents, as a means of increasing egg production, or preda-
tion, as in the case described here.
Hornbill eggs are cream in colour, lacking any camouflage markings.
This egg, which measured 7.16 cm by 4.92 cm and weighed 85.70 g, was
removed from the nest on the day it was laid and transported to our incu-
bation unit. The egg was weighed daily (see data table) and candled
periodically to monitor embryonic development. A Marsh Farms incu-
bator was used at a temperature of 37.2*C dry bulb, and the wet bulb
kept at a constant 30.0*C. The egg was turned manually every two hours,
12 hours a day.
On the nineteenth day of the 43-day incubation, the egg was dropped
sustaining an indentation which measured 1.78 cm in length, 1.57 cm in
width, and .036 cm deep, proximate to the air cell. Extending outward
from the area was a series of minute fractures measuring, at the most
distal points, 2.98 cm by 4.32 cm. However, the underlaying outer-shell

membrane remained intact.
A non-toxic adhesive (we use a product manufactured by Borden Inc.
called Elmer's Glue) was carefully applied to the damaged areas avoiding
any excess to minimise the amount covering the air cell or shell pores. This
was in hope of reducing excessive water loss and potentially lethal viral
and/or bacterial infections.
Embryo development progressed normally and on the 41st day of in-
cubation the chick pipped. The normal interval between pipping and
hatching is 48 hours, but the presence of the adhesive precluded any
any possibility of the chick emerging unassisted. Small pieces of the shell
were carefully removed simulating the typical hatching sequence. The
chick's emergence revealed a perfectly normal bird, both in appearance
and behaviour. These altricial birds are quite easy to hand-rear and this
individual proved to be no exception.
Summary
1. When deciding if the damage may be too extensive for treatment
and artificial incubation, it is worth considering that there is little invested

ROOSTING RIDDLES

As the days shorten, and the temperatures drop, so the problem for
birds of finding a suitable bed for the night intensifies. Not that the hour
at which birds go to roost is determined, as we might first suppose, by the
simple alternation of night and day. It isn't. It can also be governed by the
pressure of their other business, in particular by when they need to feed.
Owls usually hunt by night, and therefore rest by day. The Nightjar relaxes
for most of the night and most of the day; it is really active only at dusk
and again at dawn when the particular kinds of insect it feeds on are them-
selves on the wing. Estuary-loving ducks and geese, like the Wigeon and
Brent Goose that feed on eel-grass normally only uncovered at low tide,
have to sleep at high tide, whether that happens to be at night or day.
In the land of the midnight sun' - that is to say, north of the arctic
circle in high summer - there is no night or day. The birds there - terns,
gulls and other seabirds - either take a few hours off just before midnight,
or catnap at intervals throughout the 24 hours.
Birds on the whole, however, unlike the majority of mammals, are
diurnal and therefore roost at night. What determines where they sleep?
Warmth? Shelter from wind and ram? Safety from predators? Well, these
three are certainly some of the factors that must influence them.
Small birds in particular have an acute problem of potential heat loss.
The tinier a bird is, the greater difficulty it has in keeping warm because
its surface area is greater in relation to the volume of its body. So what do
they do? Well, in some species a number of them get together and make
themselves into one big organism for the night! On the continent of Europe

as many as ten Short-toed Treecreepers have been found huddled together
for the night; up to 50 Long-tailed Tits have been observed doing the
same. The other kind of treecreeper in Europe, the 'common' one, seems
always to sleep alone, though it has shown remarkable adaptability in
another way, as I later explain.
Best-known North American 'huddler' is perhaps the Winter Wren. It is
among the very smallest of birds and is found not only in America but
also in temperate Asia and in Europe. In Britain, in the exceptionally
severe winter of early 1963, up to 50 Wrens were counted entering a tit
nesting box in the Isle of Wight. Tens and twenties are commonplace.
Once they are inside the box or natural cavity they arrange themselves
in circles, heads to the centre, often several tiers high.
Even some big birds have to keep warm at night by physical contact
when the 'outside' temperatures are really low. The classic example is
the Emperor Penguin of Antarctica. The difference in temperature between
the surrounding atmosphere and the body of the bird itself sometimes
exceeds 140*F. In other words, the bird is maintaining 105*F when the
thermometer is reading -34*F. Shoulder-to-shoulder massing is vital to the
species' survival, and the formations of birds may persist for 48 hours or
more if a blizzard blows up. Warmer birds on the inside allow themselves
to be elbowed to the periphery of the scrum, but as soon as they get cold
they fight to return so that others can do a turn, back to the wind. Only
by evolving sleeping methods like these can the Emperors of Antarctica
deal with some of the most appalling weather found anywhere on this
planet.
Bearing in mind how many of the world's 9,000 species of birds build
nests, it is surprising that so few species build 'roost-nests' for winter pro-
tection. A few do, but not many. Certain kinds of woodpecker chisel out
not only a spring hole as a nursery for their young, but an autumn one as
well, to see themselves through the winter. Unlike the woodpecker,
another species that lives in the vertical world of the tree trunk, the
Common Treecreeper, can't excavate either nest-hole or roost cranny. Its
thin, curved, fragile beak is adapted for extracting tiny insects from crev-
ices in bark. In Britain all native trees are far too tough for it to hack away
at; it has always had to find existing crevices for both breeding and sleep-
ing. But then in 1853 the Wellingtonia Sequoia gigantea tree was intro-
duced from North America - a tree with an exceptionally soft, fibrous
bark. By the turn of the century the first specimens had grown sufficiently
for the spongy bole to be about two inches thick. In 1905 a remarkable
discovery was made; a neat, rounded hole in the bark of a Wellingtonia
in Scotland. It looked as if someone had half-pressed a china hen's egg into
the side of the tree. It was thought to be the work of a woodpecker, but

inspection with a lamp at night revealed a Treecreeper resting soundly in
the cavity! Without any previous known experience of excavation, the bird
had made a do-it-yourself bed. Nowadays Treecreepers all over Britain are
hacking out their own night-time cavities in an American tree. The Tree-
creeper is the only bird known to science that deliberately creates a roost-
site using a technique not also employed in any other activity such as nest-
building.
The &amp;apos;Treecreeper took advantage of an opportunity unwittingly provided
by man. There are other examples of this. In London, Salisbury, and
doubless other cities, sparrows and titmice roost inside electric street
lamps, benefit ting from the artificially provided warmth. These lamps are
small, and fine for birds that sleep alone. Those that like company have to
find somewhere more accommodating. Pied Wagtails, which always roost
in scores or hundreds, have taken to glasshouses for the night in a number
of English counties. Not only are conservatories warmer, but they are pro-
tected from rain and draughts as well.
Pied Wagtails also roost in the open in the centres of cities, where the
temperature is several degrees warmer than in the surrounding country
areas. In the London area Pied Wagtails nightly occupy suburban centres
like Balham and Barnet, Bromley and Croydon, Ealing and Golders Green.
Suburbia is host-dormitory for the night to hundreds of Pied Wagtails
that gather in roadside trees in the best lit and busiest thoroughfares. In
Dublin's fair city I have counted 1,00.0 wagtails in one tree in the heart
of the capital The birds must converge on the Irish capital each evening
from as far as five or ten miles around. An urban roost of Goldfinches has
recently been reported from Kensington in London, and I would not be
surprised if the Jackdaw became a commuter from the neighbouring
countryside to one of our great cities. Three capital cities of Europe
already invaded nightly by these characterful little crows are Sofia in
Bulgaria, Stockholm in Sweden, and Alma Ata in Soviet Central Asia.
In Moscow I have seen Hooded Crows assembling in trees near Red Square
and in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, I estimated several thousand Rooks in
the trees of Maxim Gorky Boulevard,
But the best-known urban rooster world-wide is, of course, that prime
opportunist, the costermonger of the bird world, the Starling. In America,
Europe and Australia, as well as in Britain, Starlings commute nightly to
the well-lit, busy thoroughfares, travelling anything up to 30 miles to do
so. One such roost I well recall is in the centre of Philadelphia.
There are species, however, that seem to care little for shelter; Ameri-
can Crows perch high in trees all night. I have seen them in Wichita.
Perhaps for them the safety of being aloft outweighs the comfort they
might find at lower levels.

There is at least one bird species that spends all night on the wing: the
Swift. Radar observations have proved that Swifts rise up at dusk on
summer evenings to a height of 10,000 ft and remain airborne until near
sunrise. Whether they actually 'sleep' in our sense of the word is not
known, but they certainly stay aloft all night.
Comparatively little is known of the postures adopted for roosting.
Only a few species, if any, put their 'heads under the wing' in the legen-
dary phrase; most sink it down on to the shoulders, as it were. The Bat-
parrots of south-east Asia hang upside down from branches by their feet!
Birds resident in an area almost certainly return to the same perches
each night, though in some cases each individual may have two or three to
choose from depending on the weather. Individual birds in communal
roosts return to precisely the twig or whatever each evening, as ringing
and the observations on the occasional albino birds have proved. The
careful 'allocation' of individual 'beds' in this way is probably impor-
tant in avoiding an energy-wasting scramble for places each dusk. Roosts
of crows and wagtails may number hundreds; those of House Sparrows
and Rooks run into thousands; and those of Starlings and Red-winged
Blackbirds may be estimated in millions. The biggest Starling roost in
Britain is estimated at three million birds.
If you want to see roosting birds for yourself, the easiest course is to
take up a commanding position somewhere an hour or so before sunset
and scan the view with binoculars. I used to do this from the top of the
160 ft Nelson Pillar in Dublin before it was rudely felled one night by
saboteurs of the Irish Republican Army. From the parapet I watched the
nightly invasion of the central area by my favourites, the Pied Wagtails,
and also by Starlings. From a more rural vantage point, such as, for ex-
ample, the ridge of the South Downs in Sussex, straggling lines and untidy
flocks of Jackdaws and Rooks can be seen etching patterns on the evening
sky. Following the flightlines of any large and conspicuous roosters can
be a rewarding experience.
The tracing of flight lines to the actual dormitory at the hub is natu-
rally followed up by plotting numbers of arriving birds against time of
day (or better, the relative brightness of the sky as measured by a light
meter). Such measurements often reveal that on 'shorter' days birds
retire later relative to sundown since they have had fewer daylight hours
in which to collect food. On overcast evenings the birds go to bed earlier
than on clear evenings at the same season.
One would suppose that roosts of English sparrows might be easy to
find, but they are not as easy as those of some other species. Sparrows are
small birds, less noisy than many; moreover they fly to their sites in small
parties or even ones and twos, and often not in a very direct line. Even so,

a British ornithologist found 24 different roosts in an area of 3Vi square
miles in central London, varying in size from 20 to 2,100 birds.
Why birds congregate in this way is a big puzzle. It can hardly be for
warmth since the birds are not perched close enough to one another to
raise the local temperature appreciably. It could be that there Is safety in
numbers. If there are a lot of you together, an approaching enemy - a fox
or an owl - is more likely to be spotted sooner, and the alarm raised with a
call from the most alert member of the flock. But against this we know
that predators are attracted by roosts, and it seems that they must take
more birds than they could if the prey species were widely distributed
each night over the country. Perhaps the most likely theory is one recently
proposed: that the coming-together each night functions to dispense Infor-
mation about food availability. At dawn those that fed well the previous
day may be expected to fly out more purposefully towards yesterday's
feeding grounds than those that fed less well. It could be that the hungrier
ones are more hesitant and allow themselves to get caught up in the flocks
that have adopted a firmer course. Certainly this is the most attractive
explanation to date of the mighty aggregations of birds that assemble
nightly.

or Yellow-crowned Canary. During the breeding season it constructs a sub-
stantial cup of vegetable matter in the form of leaves, pine needles, twigs,
roots, lichen, moss, string, wool, etc., but especially Helichrysum , The
lining may consist of the pappi of composite plants, fur and fine grass
fibres. The nest is situated in the fork or horizontal branch of a bush or
tree at 1-18 m above the ground. This serin is usually a solitary nester, but
sometimes is in a loose colony of ten or more nests in stands of exotic
trees, namely pines and oaks, but recently recorded in Ouhout trees
Leucosidea sericea. The female constructs the nest which can take up to
two weeks to complete. Breeds from August to December in the south-
western Cape Province, Natal and Transvaal, South Africa, and from
September to February in Zimbabwe. Two to five eggs are laid. They are
white to pale greenish white, plain or marked with speckles and blotches
and scrolled with black, brown and grey, chiefly at the large end. Egg
measurements average (6) 17,2 x 12,8 (15,8-18,9 x 11,6-13,6). Incubation
is by the female and lasts 12-14 days; nestling period is 15-19 days. Aviary
breedings are few. No explanation is forthcoming as to why they are
reluctant to breed in captivity.
The Black-eared Canary S. mennelli is more commonly known outside
Africa as Mennell's Seedeater. When nesting it builds a deep cup, mainly
of lichens and then bound with spider's web. Bark, feathers and other
plant matter may be woven into the outer shell. The lining is fine grass,
rootlets and moss. It has been recorded using Goat's Beard Usnea barbata
in Zimbabwe. Nests are usually built in the outer fork of a tree at 1-9 m
from the ground. It breeds from November to February in Zimbabwe with
two to four, usually three eggs being laid. The eggs are greenish white or
pale bluish, spotted and speckled with brown, purple and black, chiefly
at the large end. Egg measurements 20,2 x 14,8 (17, 2-22 x 13,2-16). The
incubation and nestling periods are not recorded for the wild, but in
aviary birds incubation is recorded as 12-14 days (2), nestling period 15-19

The Streaky-headed Canary Serinus gularis is also known as the
Streaky Seedeater and Streaky-headed Seedeater. At the start of the nest-
ing season (October to January in the Transvaal, September to February
:in Natal, South Africa, and September to March in Zimbabwe), it con-
structs a loosely formed cup of grass, twigs, dead leaves and bark, lined
with vegetable matter and wool. In Zimbabwe, Guineafowl feathers were
recorded in a nest. Nests are placed in vertical or horizontal forks of trees
and bushes, between clusters of pine cones and behind peeling tree bark,
at 1.5-12 m up from the ground. Two to four eggs are laid. They are
white or pale blue, plain or lightly spotted with brown, purple and black,
chiefly at the large end. Egg measurements average (54) 18.5 x 13.8(17-
21.2 x 12.6-15). Incubation is by the female, and lasts 12-15 days; the
nestling period is 14-17 days.
The Cape Canary feeds on achenes which play a major part in the
diet, supplemented with graminoid seed, other small seed, soft plant
parts, fruit pulp, fallen grain and insects.
Food genera recorded in the diet of this species: Inula , Athanasia,
Metalasia, Senecio, Sonchus, Elytropappus, Stoebe, Eriocephalus (the

BREEDING AND HAND-REARING THE BLACK PALM
COCKATOO PRO BO SCIGER ATERRIMUS
</sectionHeader>

By Mr and Mrs* R. MANN
(Peterborough)
Bates and Busenbark (1969) refer to this cockatoo as fearsome looking
rather than beautiful At first sight, most people would agree with them.
However, they are not the type of bird to be discounted out of hand. To
us they are magnificent. Proud, regal, on the whole shy birds, stamping
their feet when alarmed or annoyed, awkward and ungainly but somehow
commanding respect
According to Joseph M. Forshaw's excellent Parrots of the World , the
Palm Cockatoo inhabits forest and savannah woodland in New Guinea and
surrounding islands extending to Cape York Peninsula in Northern Australia.
They feed on seeds, nuts, fruits, berries and leaf buds. On Cape York Pen-
insula they have been seen eating seeds of the kanari and black bean tree
and the fruits of the nonda and palm tree.
The plumage is greyish black, forehead and lores black. The naked cheek
patches pass from bright red to almost white when alarmed, excited or un-
der stress. The female's upper mandible is smaller than the male's. Forshaw
says that in immatures feathers of under wing-coverts and underparts are
edged with pale yellow. We have never found this to be the case in young.
It is more likely to be diet deficiency, lack of melanin, or more probably
over-preening by parents resulting in yellow re-growth feathers. Have any
other breeders seen this yellow edging?
This particular unsexed pair of Palm Cockatoos belonged to feUow-
member George A Smith and were given into our keeping approximately
13 years ago. We were somewhat inexperienced in bird husbandry at that
time and consequently the first aviary introduced to them was quite un-
suitable and as far as this pair were concerned, just a place to climb about,
feed and generally just pass the time of day. No interest at all was shown
in the conventional, albeit substantial nest-box offered to them.
On one of our 4 move-a-roends 9 we decided to rehouse this pair in a
much smaller aviary 14 x 7 x 5 ft which, having black hanging slate tiles
to the back wall, was quite dark and, in fact, it was extremely difficult
to distinguish the pair of Palm Cockatoos. We hoped this environment
would prove more suitable for breeding. We had decided to incorporate
a wooden sloping nest-box into the back wall with an inspection door
through into the back alleyway. The basic principle of our nest-boxes was
utilised, i.e. steps inside made out of blocks of wood thus enabling the
birds to whittle away and make up their own nesting material. However,
we soon found out that when Palm Cockatoos decide to build a nest,

they need a little more than just a few wooden steps in a nest-box!
Unknown to us, they had chewed all the wood inside the box and,
still needing nesting material, had gone out through the false ceiling in
their aviary and brought back wood from the roof of the Sun Connies'
aviary some 840 ft away.
In 1982, much to our delight (and dismay), we found a broken egg
on the floor of the aviary - we had a hen at least. The nest-box was proving
quite unsatisfactory as the hen had chewed so much wood she could be
seen sitting on the top of her nesting material We had to think of some-
thing else. Concrete blocks seemed to be food for thought - definitely
parrot-proof and hopefully able to withstand the enormous destructive
strength of the cockatoos' beaks. Still adopting the sloping principle, the
concrete nest-box was built out of a total of 32 blocks. No wood was
fixed inside. For nesting material we pushed large bushy branches to the
back of the aviary, giving a dense forest effect and then waited. Would the
cockatoos accept something so alien? Within two days chewed up bits of
branches had been taken into the box and within a week most of the
nesting material had disappeared. The birds still were not satisfied. Every-
thing moveable and chewable went in, even the large plastic washing-up
bowl used as their water container. Both birds built the enormous nest
which must have had a depth of at least 2% ft of chewed and splintered
wood.
On 27th April 1984 the hen laid. The single egg measured 49.25 x
34.30 mm and weighed 30.92 g when taken out at eight days. George
Smith suggested fostering it under a pair of his Sulphur-crested Cockatoos,
housed with friends in Peterborough. This pair had fortunately laid two
eggs and were very steady and reliable. The total incubation time was 34
days, the chick taking four days to hatch from pipping. Quite a long time
by parrot standards and quite testing on the nerves of the keeper! How-
ever, the foster birds refused to feed the chick, possibly sensing by call
that it was not their own. After some 18 hours and the chick still not
fed, it was decided to take it for hand-rearing. It was the ugliest chick we
had ever seen and, as the saying goes, 'only its mother could love it.!
Having already set the brooder at 98* in readiness, we fed the chick
initially on 1 ml Milupa 7-Cereal food made up to a very runny consis-
taecy every two hours. The last feed was given at 11.30 p.m. and the
first at 5.30 a.m. A little yoghurt was added on the second day. The chick
differed from other cockatoos we had reared hi that it hatched with no
down. Ears were sealed and the toes fused together (these did not unfurl
until day 9). Its skin was a very bright, pinky red, quite unlike any other
chick we had seen. The food was increased slightly to 2 ml every 3-3%
hours after five days, and a few grains of ground sunflower seed were

added. It was our intention at the outset to hold the chick back and res-
train from over-feeding, a common cause of death in, young chicks. Hence
the extended day and night feeds.
On day 9 Milupa Mixed Vegetable baby food was added to the cereal
and ground sunflower. The mix was still fed fairly runny. More import-
antly, the crop was empty the majority of the time, always a worrying
aspect of hand-rearing. What to do when it does not empty? In this in-
stance the chick was left perhaps another hour and if the crop was still
not quite empty, it was fed a smaller amount to top it up. This way the
chick sometimes went as long as 4 1 h hours between feeds. A sliver of
skin inside the mouth similar to a gum shield had disappeared on day 3.
This hard, gristle-type skin was nowhere to be seen in the nesting material
and was assumed to have been swallowed by the chick and although we
were concerned at the time, there were no adverse effects.
&quot;Cede&amp;apos; was added on day 15. The rearing diet was, therefore, made up
of equal quantities of Milupa Mixed Vegetable, ground sunflower seeds
and &amp;apos;Cede' (no fruit); the 7-Cereal was dropped. During all this time the
young chick had a coarse, very harsh-sounding scream which he exercised
to abundance before and after feeds. The eyes were slit open by day 17
and the sides of the bottom mandible were taking on a bulbous shape. The
temperature was still kept high - 95* - much higher than we would nor
maJJv expect to keep a chick in of that age. By day 20 the black crest
markings were just visible under the crown with a nice sheen to the head
and a dark area forming on the bridge of the beak. The head was much
larger in proportion to the body and the chick was, in fact, quite an ugly
looking specimen.
Food intake was progressing gradually, reaching 7-8 ml each five-hourly
feed at 24 days. At day 26 we changed to spoon feeding. We had decided
to keep him on the syringe quite late in order that we could monitor Ms
intake. Pin feathers were now breaking through the back in parallel lines
down the spine, although no pin feathers or down was visible on the main
body area. The red cheek patches were just beginning to appear at day 30.
When put into a plastic fish tank (an ideal rearing container) with an
Amazon parrot chick for company, at day 40, he measured 12 in high.
The feathers were breaking from the quills at 46 days. During all this time
the chick, now named Duke', loved attention although he would scream if
any other person came into the rearing room, particularly men.
He was put on three meals a day at nine weeks and continued to make
steady growth and progress until independent at six months, the longest it
had taken to wean a hand-reared chick.
The weight chart of the cMck compares favourably with that of an
adult Black Palm Cockatoo.

THE FIVE MOST TYPICAL WAXBILLS

I apologise to readers for the rather odd title of this article but I
could not think of a better one that was reasonably short. 'The typical
waxbills' would hardly have done since I, and others, have used it else-
where to include all the species now put in the genus Estrilda, and here
I propose to deal only with five closely related species, the Common
Wax bill Estrilda astrild , the Black-lored Waxbill E. nigriloris, the
Rosy-rumped Waxbill E. rhodopyga, the Black-rumped Waxbill
E. troglodytes and the Arabian Waxbill F. rufibarba. If, as is common-
ly and I think rightly thought, the name waxbill was originally applied
to either the Common or the Black-rumped Waxbill because of their
red, sealing wax-like bills, then it seems justifiable to use the term
'most typical' for this little group of similar and related species.
All five are generally very similar in appearance being mainly brown
or brownish grey in general colour with a pattern of fine cross-barring
on most of the plumage, a conspicuous red or (one only) black eye-
stripe and red or partly red bills. Most of them are allopatric or nearly
so but the Common and Rosy-rumped Waxbills show a large area of
overlap on the map, although the evidence suggests that in such areas
of apparent overlap they are confined to different habitats or altitude.
All build rather large, compact nests with an entrance tube and
usually with a 'cock nest' on top of or alongside it. It seems very like-
ly that all are parasitised by the Pin-tailed Whydah Vidua macroura, as
the Common Waxbill is known to be.
The Common Waxbill Estrilda astrild
Description and other names: This species is, or was, commonly
known as the St. Helena Waxbill by bird dealers, although it was intro-
duced to that island. Other names that are, or have been, sometimes
used for it are Brown Waxbill, Barred Waxbill and Pheasant Finch.
It is about a third smaller than a House Sparrow of the nominate
race Passer d. domesticus but looks only about half the size, with a
trim shape and longish tail. It shows much minor variation in size and
colour in different parts of its range (Goodwin, 1982) and for reasons
of space I must attempt an overall composite description here. Its
upperparts vary (racially and to some slighter extent individually)
from dark to light brown, which may be either reddish or greyish or

neither in general tone but is always marked with fine but distinct
cross-barring on all feathers except those of forehead, primaries and
to some extent the tail quills and feathers on the crown of the head.
In some forms the brown parts, especially on the rump, may be
tinged with red. The cheeks, throat and sometimes also the upper
breast are whitish, pale grey or pale pink. The rest of the under
parts are pale greyish, pale fawn or pinkish, each feather cross-barred
with brownish or greyish, except for a scarlet, crimson, rose-red or
deep pink belly patch (which in some races 'spreads' on to flanks or
breast) and a blackish or dark brown ventral area and under tail
coverts. The bill is bright red, the eyes brown and the legs dark brown
or blackish.
Hens are, as compared with males from the same locality and in
similar state of plumage, usually less brightly red on the belly, less
suffused with pink on the underparts and with less intensely dark
ventral area and under tail coverts. The juvenile is duller, with only
faint cross-barring on the feathers, the red and blackish areas on the
underparts only slightly indicated and the red eye stripe duller and
edged below with blackish. Its bill is at first blackish but soon starts
to change colour.
Distribution and habitat : The Common Wax bill has a wide range
in tropical and southern Africa, south of the range of the Black-rumped
Waxbi.ll. It has been successfully introduced into St. Helena, Mauri-
tius, Reunion, the Seychelles, Amirantes, New Caledonia, Tahiti,
Brazil, Portugal and possibly elsewhere. It inhabits fairly open country
with long grass, marshes, cultivated areas, especially abandoned or
partially abandoned cultivation at the stages when wild grasses and
weeds are taking over, and grassy clearings in forest or woodland.
This species is the only waxbill I have seen wild in its native habi-
tat. As a young soldier spending a fantastic fortnight in Durban in
May 1941, en route to the Middle East, I was taken out by an hospi-
table South African couple to see some famous beauty spot. Walking
on a wild, grassy hillside, with wonderful views over undulating hills
and valleys I suddenly heard a bird call that seemed familiar and look-
ing around saw a pair of Common Wax bills ('St. Helena Waxbilis')
nearby, perched on some long, dead stems, looking anxiously at us
and agitatedly swinging their tails from side to side. For a moment
I thought that they must have escaped from some birdshop or aviary
then realised that, of course, I was in Africa and they were wild birds.
Much later, in October 1972, I saw a flock of these birds on some
waste ground more or less in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil.
Feeding habits : Like its congeners, this species can cling easily

among growing vegetation and hold grass panicles, stems and other
such objects under foot when feeding or collecting nest material.
Seeds, taken both from growing plants and from the ground are the
staple diet. In Africa grasses of the genera Setaria, Paspalum and Digi-
taria are often, probably usually, important food plants. In Brazil
seeds of several grasses, a sedge and the Amaranth are commonly taken.
Swarming termites are eaten (Irnmelmann et al) and it is very likely
that other small insects are also eaten at times.
I have no experience of this bird in captivity. At times it seems
incredibly hardy or at least resistant as I have known birds live a long
time incarcerated in small cages in pet shops and apparently fed on
nothing but dry seed. Irnmelmann et al, in their comprehensive work
on estrildids in captivity, recommend that only small kinds of millet
should be offered (I doubt if the larger millets will do any harm if the
birds have ample supplies of the small panicum millet as well) and that
greenfood, 'half ripe' seeds, soaked seeds and insect food should also
be offered and the birds not kept below a temperature of 15*C.
Most of the few records of captive breeding that I have seen in-
volved pairs in large aviaries where it was uncertain precisely what
foods were taken by the waxbills but our late member, Sir Godfrey
Davis, successfully bred Common Waxbills in a cage in India. His
birds at first fed the young mainly on seeds of grasses given to them
and hard-boiled egg yolk but after the fifth day a little egg was taken
and small maggots (not from the Blow Fly) and grass seeds were fed
to the young.
Behaviour, voice and nesting: The calls and song (or what passes
for song) have been described in detail elsewhere by our member
Colin Harrison (1962). They are generally rather short and harsh calls
and throaty bubblings but higher pitched and less nasal than the
corresponding notes of the Black-rumped and Rosy-rumped Waxbills.
The greeting display is similar to those of other typical waxbills
and of the fire finches Lagonosticta spp., a lowering of the body,
turning the head towards and bowing towards the other bird while
giving contact calls. There follows a slower return to the normal body
position. As in other estrildids, the tail is angled towards the other
bird in all displays that are sexually motivated but in this and other
Estrilda species, which wag or switch their tails from side to side in
almost any excitement, the angled tail posture is sometimes only indi-
cated by the greater amplitude of the movement on the side towards
the bird displayed to.
In courtship display the bird holds a long grass stem, a feather or
other nesting material by one end in the bill and with bill pointing

starts to sing after a few upward movements but the hen, who if inter-
ested responds with the same display, is said not to. This display does
not usually lead directly to copulation which is seldom seen and
therefore thought, probably correctly, to take place in the nest.
The rather large, round to pear-shaped nest is built of grass stems,
lined with finer grasses and sometimes a few feathers. It has a down-
ward sloping entrance tube from 4-15 in long and about 1 in in dia-
meter inside. Usually a cock nest is placed on top of the real nest. This
cock nest seems usually, in the wild, not to get beyond the cup-shaped
or half-domed stage. When alarmed or suspicious, the birds fuss noisily
around the cock nest and carry conspicuous objects to it (Van Som-
eren). The nest may be sited on the ground in grass or other vegeta-
tion or up to about 12 ft above ground in some bush, tree, or creeper.
Ground nests often have a cleared space in front of the entrance hole.
I suspect this functions to aid the birds to see and remove in time
potentially dangerous insects, particularly the 'scouts' of foraging
parties of ants.
The Black-lored Waxbill E. nigriloris
Description : It is not certain whether this is a 'good' species or a
very marked race of the Common Waxbill but for reasons discussed
elsewhere (Goodwin) it seems best treated as a full species provision-
ally. Apart from having most of its plumage more strongly tinged with
pink and a less definite red belly patch than most forms of E. astrild,
it differs from the Common Waxbill only in having a black, not red,
eyestripe.
Distribution and habitat: Found in Zaire (formerly the Congo), on
the banks of the Lualaba River, near latitude 8 26' S., and the shores
of Lake Upemba, in level, grassy areas with trees and bushes.
Other information
Virtually nil (unless I have missed some recent publications on it).
Collected specimens had eaten grass seed. This species seems unlikely
to be available to aviculturists.
The Black-rumped Waxbill Estrilda troglodytes
Description and other names : This species is often called Red-
eared Waxbill in avicultural circles. Common Waxbill and Grey Waxbill
are also frequently used names in aviculture, leading to confusion

with Estrilda astrild and E, perreini. It is, or at least was, one of the
most commonly imported species. Usually it was sold much more
cheaply than the Common ('St. Helena') Waxbill although, in my
opinion, it is a more beautiful bird and indeed, in spite of its generally
'quiet' coloration, one of the loveliest of all estrildids, the Gouldian
Finch not excepted.
It is a little smaller in size than the Common Waxbill and the
general colour is paler, light brownish grey above with delicate cross
barring of a darker shade of the same colour. The underparts are also
paler. In some birds the whole plumage is beautifully tinged with
delicate pink, in others this pink tinge is less or even absent. There is
a rosy-red patch on the belly that often spreads somewhat upwards on
to the lower breast and flanks. There is a red eye-stripe as in astrild.
The rump, upper tail coverts and tail are black except for the outer
webs of the second from outermost pair, which are whitish. The bill
is bright red, the legs dark brownish or blackish.
Females tend to have less extensive red on the underparts and less
often to have the whole plumage strongly tinged with pink but this
difference is only true of the majority and some hens are as pink as
any cocks. Differences between adult and juvenile are similar to those
described for the Common Waxbill.
Distribution and habitat: The semi-arid zone of Africa north of the
range of the Common Waxbill (or most of it) from Senegal and Gam-
bia east to north-eastern Zaire, north-western Uganda, the Sudan
north to Darfur and Sennar, Eritrea and north-western Abyssinia. It is
found in grassy savannas, thorn scrub (with some grass), marshes and
sometimes cultivated areas but seldom very close to human habita-
tions.
Feeding habits : Little studied in the wild but known to take grass
seeds and 'midges' and to feed both in growing grasses and on the
ground. In the 1960s I kept four of this species, two hens, paired
together and originally mistakenly thought to be a cock and hen, were
with me for about eight years. I found that they took mostly white
millet and pannicum millet but also at times a little small canary seed.
They were fond of both green and ripe seeds of the Annual Meadow
Grass Poa annua and would also eat the seeds of some other grasses,
Chickweed Stellaria media and Knotgrass Polygonum aviculare. Tiny
unidentified (by me) flying insects were caught on the wing and green
aphids (but not black or grey aphids), and the pupae and larvae of the
small ants of the genus Lasius were usually taken eagerly. Like Ava-
davats Arnandava amandava and Goldbreasts A. subflava they also

often ate the growing tips of grass shoots.
I found them (to my surprise) much readier to sample artificial
soft foods such as milk sop, sponge cage (homemade) and cooked egg
than any of my other waxbills except the Rosy-rumped.
Behaviour, voice and nesting : Most of the calls of this bird are
loud and rather harsh for so small and dainty a creature. A repressed
cheu-cheu or chit-chit appears to serve as a short distance contact call
and also to indicate the intention to fly. A louder, upwardly inflected
cheer or cheee-ay indicates alarm and perhaps other conditions of
excitement. A more buzzing version is sometimes given in threat. A
soft murmuring twitter is given as a nest call and sometimes when
changing over during incubation. The song is very variable. A loud,
explosive double note tche-tcheer! or chee-eeer! with the second note
in each case strongly upwardly inflected; and an equally explosive
tchu-weee with the second note descending were the commonest and
most divergent versions I heard. Females are said not to sing but one
of mine sometimes did so, her song I transcribed as Pwich! Cheee!
with the second note upwardly inflected with a second version which
consisted just of the explosive Pwich! note twice repeated. Song is
given by the male (and in my experience also sometimes by the female)
when performing the courtship display, but sometimes when the bird
is alone.
The courtship display is very similar to that of the Common Wax-
bill (q.v.). The male sings during his display, the female tends to dis-
play less often and usually (but by no means always) without singing.
Quite often birds will display when alone and in such cases, as also
when the bird displayed to is directly in front of the displayer, the
flanks are not fluffed out more on one side than the other and the
tail is held straight out behind.
In what Kunkel termed 'the fluffed singing display', a cock, with-

out nesting material in the bill but otherwise in the posture of the court-
ship display, will hop after and/or around a hen, singing repeatedly. This
behaviour is shown at least in captivity, towards hens that the cock in
question knows but is not paired to. If the hen does not flee, the male
attempts to copulate forcibly with her, usually (always in the instances
that I have watched) without success.
Mutual preening between paired or friendly individuals is common in
this species as in its relatives.
All descriptions in books (that I have read) of wild nests of this species
seem to be derived, with or without acknowledgements, from Shuel who
found three nests in northern Nigeria. They were pear-shapes, made of

dry grass heads and each had a cock nest in the form of a 'cup-like exten-
sion' on one side. Each nest was on the ground at the foot of a clump of
grass or small bush.
In captivity this species often chooses to nest well above floor or
ground level in a bush or in a basket or other receptacle but this is prob-
ably an artifact of captivity caused by too much disturbance or no suit-
able site at ground level. The nest is ball- to pear-shaped and usually has an
entrance tube but this may sometimes be only the merest suggestion of a
tube at the small, low entrance hole. In captivity the birds will use various
grasses and/or coconut fibre to construct the nest and line it with feathers
or other soft materials. I dissected a number of nests built by my captive
birds and always found in them numbers of feathers (mostly white or pale
in colour but sometimes a few dark ones) bits of tissue paper, cloth or
plant wool and a few pieces of earth. Pieces of eggshell, dry excreta, bits of
shiny looking wet earth and almost any materials that are either white or
dark and shining are placed on top of the nest and in and around the en-
trance of the cock nest. Tiny dead and rotting nestlings or dead and put-
rescent large insects are taken with extreme eagerness and placed in or near
the entrance of the cock nest. I have also often seen the birds take wet
earth in their bills and make movements as if they were rubbing the grass
or other material at the nest entrance with it.
I observed repeatedly with my birds that when in apparent conflict
between the urge to incubate and fear or suspicion, they would fuss
around and carry objects to the cock nest. This was most marked with a
pair nesting in a basket on the wall of the bird room. Here they were, of
course, unable to build a cock nest on top so they used a basket about
2 ft away, and containing an active nest of a pair of Blue-headed Cordon-
bleus as a substitute and would fly to it and fuss around it when perturbed.
There has been much argument and speculation about the function (if
any) of the cock nests of this and other birds. I have gone into this in some
detail elsewhere (Goodwin). Suffice here to say that I think the function
* of it is to 'draw a red herring across the trail' and mislead some predator or
predators who might otherwise discover the real nest beneath. Whether
this is the case, and what predator or predators are involved, only studies
of wild birds 'in the field' are likely to reveal.
When nest-building, this bird, like the Rosy-rumped Waxbill (and, I ex-
pect, the other species being dealt with here) will reach up, pull down a
grass stem, hold it underfoot, neatly bite through the stem and sever it.
This behaviour enables these species to obtain live stems, or dead stems
firmly attached to a clump, at which a cordon-blue Uraeginthus sp. or
flrefinch Lagonosticta sp. can only tug and jerk in vain.

The Arabian Waxbill Estrilda rufibarba
Description: This species is sometimes considered a race of E. troglo-
dytes but I think it best given specific rank for reasons discussed elsewhere.
(Goodwin). It differs from the Black-ramped Waxbill in being very slightly
larger and with rather larger bill and longer tail. The ground colour of both
upper and under parts is greyish brown with much stronger, darker bar-
ring and without any tinge of pink. The central tail feathers and the ramp
are a less intense black, often more blackish brown, and a minority of
birds have some admixture of dark red on the ramp. There is no red on
the belly. The eyestripe is a darker red and in some hens intermixed with
black. The bill is blackish with a red mark on each side of the upper man-
dible and at the sides and base of the lower mandible.
Distribution and Habitat : South-western Arabia. Inhabits valleys and
ravines with bushes or reedbeds.
Feeding and other behaviour: Virtually nothing appears to be recorded
beyond that it eats the seeds of grasses and rushes. Probably in captivity
it would behave essentially as the Black-rumped Waxbill. I have, however,
never heard of it being imported and as it is less beautiful than the Black-
rumped, Rosy-rumped and Common Waxbills, it would have little but its
rarity to commend it to aviculturists. I mean nothing to make it more des-
irable than these other species.
Rosy-rumped Waxbill Estrilda rhodopyga
Description and other names: Also known as the Crimson-ramped
Waxbill, Rosy-winged Waxbill and SundevalTs Waxbill, this species used to
cost considerably more than the Black-rumped Waxbill (and perhaps still
does) though it is not, in my opinion, quite so beautiful in appearance and
has a harsher voice.
As compared with the Arabian Waxbill, described above and which it
much resembles, this species is rather more buffy, less grey in tone in the
brown parts of its plumage and the cross-barring is less intense though
more so than in the Black-rumped Waxbill. The under tail coverts have
dark barring or mottling and are more or less fringed with red. The outer
webs of the greater coverts and the inner secondaries are fringed with deep
rose-pink or carmine, forming two subdued red patches on the folded
wing. The upper tail coverts and outer edges of the tail feathers are also
deep rose-pink to crimson or carmine.
Distribution and habitat: Eastern tropical Africa from the southern
Sudan, Eritrea and eastern Abyssinia south to northern Tanzania and nor-
thern Malawi. It inhabits dry grassland with bushes, acacia savannah, river-
side scrub and sometimes cultivated areas. The presence of surface water
seems to be essential

Feeding habits : I have seen no detailed account of its food in the wild.
It is known to take grass seeds both from growing plants and from the
ground and these are probably its chief food. Four captive birds, three
cocks and one hen, fed mainly on pannicum millet. They eagerly took
greed aphids, green and ripe seeds of Annual Meadow Grsss, Knotgrass and
the tips of growing grass shoots. They ate ant pupae but with less avidity
than most waxbills do and never in large amounts. Feeding methods and
methods of biting through grass stems are as I have described for the
Black-rumped Waxbill.
Behaviour, voice and nesting : The calls and song of this species are very
like those of the Black-rumped Waxbill but louder and harsher in tone. I
am therefore not describing them further here owing to shortage of space.
The displays of this species are also like those of the Black-rumped
Waxbill. In captivity my Rosy-rumped and Black-rumped Waxbills reacted
to each other as if to conspecifics. However, as only a few individuals of
each species were involved, and they were kept together in a small room,
one could not deduce from this that they would behave so in the wild, if
through extension of range or human introduction they ever came to-
gether.
A cock Rosy-rumped paired to a hen Black-rumped Waxbill had many
nests of eggs but only one egg, from a clutch of five (the usual number laid
by the hen in question), ever hatched. This bird was successfully reared. It
proved to be a hen and when adult had a rosy flush on its wing coverts and
a predominantly red rump but was otherwise more like its mother in col-
our and had an all-red bill like hers. Its 'accent' was, however, more like its
father's.
Accounts of wild nests that I have seen all seem to be derived from
that of Chapin, who found a single nest, built of grass, on the ground
among short grass. It had a lateral entrance but, apparently, no entrance
tube or cock nest. It held six eggs, two of which were larger than the other
four and were thought to be (and no doubt were) eggs of the Pin-tailed
Whydah.
Immelmann et al. say that the Rosy-rumped Waxbill has often been
bred in captivity and is easier to breed successfully because (they say) it
feeds its young more on 'half ripe' seeds and less on small insects than
other waxbills do. They do not, however, describe the nests. The above-
mentioned cock Rosy-rumped that was paired to the Black-rumped hen
built many nests, of which I think he was the main or sole architect,
though both birds 'decorated' the upper surface of the nest and carried
material to the cock nest built on top of it. Further evidence that the
Rosy-rumped cock was responsible for these nests was the consistent
difference between them and nests built by Black-rumped Waxbills under

the same conditions and in the same room, though not at the same time.
The Rosy-rumped and his mate built nests both above floor level in bas-
kets (where cock nests could not be built) and in corners on the floor of
the room. The latter were almost certainly closer to what the bird would
have built in a wild state. I dissected four of such floor nests and found
them all alike.
Each nest was made chiefly of grass stems, often with blades and seed-
ing heads attached, a very few stems of other plants, such as Chickweed
and Knotgrass were usually also present. The walls of the nest cavity were
about an inch thick and very tough and compact, in great contrast to the
nests of fire finches and cordon-bleus. The nest lining was entirely of
grass. The nest was pear-shaped, narrowing to a tubular entrance with a
very small and well-concealed entrance hole which was surrounded by
many sharp ends of grass stems so that it was not possible to insert a
finger without 'stabbing' it quite sharply on them. The cock nest (again
in each case) was much smaller than the real nest but inside it was of
about the same dimensions as the real egg chamber immediately below it
in the real nest. It had a large side entrance and was never 'completed' so
as to be a facsimile of the real nest.

The male 'decorated' the roof of the nest, especially immediately in
front of the entrance of the cock nest, with feathers, preferably white
or glossy black; pieces of white tissue paper, shiny greaseproof paper and
charred and blackened paper (similar small pieces of unburned newspaper
were never used) and clumps of either dry or wet earth, those with root-
lets protruding from them being strongly preferred. Some of all these
objects, especially white and glossy black feathers, were also placed
inside the cock nest. Twice, when I placed a dead and putrescent cordon-
bleu nestling on the floor, the cock Rosy-rumped showed extreme ex-
citement and at once carried it to the cock nest and placed it inside. The
behaviour of this cock in relation to the cock nest was identical to that
observed in (and described above) my Black-rumped Waxbills.
At times, when I had given the birds ant pupae, there were numbers of
small black ants, I believe Lasius niger in the room. When he and his
mate had eggs, the cock Rosy-rumped Waxbill always killed, or disabled
and flung away, any that he saw near the nest entrance. He ignored ants
further from the nest and, like all the estrildids I have kept, never ate
worker ants. I presume this is innate behaviour which functions to pre-
vent ants, and above all the scouts of army ant hordes, from finding and
entering the nest.
Some concluding remarks
I must own that, looking back, I did not have much success in keeping
Black-rumped or Rosy-rumped Waxbills. Although looking healthy most
of their lives, none of them lived for more than nine years and most died
after I had had them from two to six years. Nor, except in the case of the
one hybrid mentioned, did I succeed in breeding any.
I believe these rather poor results are comparable to those achieved
(if one can use 'achieve' in this connection) by many others with these
birds and possibly for rather similar reasons which are: (1) Greater in-
volvement with other species being kept at the same time (in my case other
estrildids, especially cordon-bleus); (2) The difficulty of selecting true
pairs initially from the dealers, this being compounded by the readiness
of the birds to form homosexual pairs if two hens or two cocks are, by
mistake, kept alone together; (3) That, at least in the two species I have
kept, the birds take longer (from several months to over a year) before
they start to nest in captivity than do most other small estrildids. This is
probably because the captive conditions are, to their 'birds' eye view',
further removed from the essentials of their former wild habitat than
is the case with bush-nesting species. Also, although I can truthfully
state that the monetary value of a bird has never influenced my feelings
about it, I think it likely that the fact that, at least in the past, the most

obtained in limitless numbers for a trifling price, tended to discourage
people from going to much trouble to try to breed it.
Perhaps things are otherwise now. I am sure that others beside myself
would be delighted to read the experiences and opinions of any of our
members who now keep, and hopefully breed, any of these species.

Some of the pressures on birds and animals in the tropics are in-
comprehensible to us, such as the slaughter of rhinos for their horn
which is believed to be an aphrodisiac by the Chinese. Unfortunately
the bill of the Grey-breasted Mountain Toucan Andigena hypoglauca
is also endowed with magical qualities by the people of Ecuador. On a
BBC Radio Four programme broadcast in January, Adrian Barnett related
how for this reason the Toucans are shot and their bodies discarded, or
used to make a soup which is said to be good for chest ailments. The bill
is not only ground up but also used as a charm by the people of the Rio
Mezan area of southern Ecuador, in the highland forest, where the popu-
lation of this Toucan is apparently small. This Toucan has the head,
wings and tail black, rump bright yellow and underparts blue-grey. The
bill is red, black, yellow and greenish-yellow. Adrian Barnett spoke also
of the concern the local people have for the forests. So aware are they of
the importance of the watersheds they create (the rivers being an impor-
tant source of their fresh water), that in 1976 the people pooled their
resources to buy the forest. Had they not done so it would have been
purchased by a logging company. The local people understand the im-
portance of this area of highland forest - what a pity that politicians
apparently do not...
The first Kakas Nestor meridionalis to be seen outside New Zealand
this century now reside in Stuttgart Zoo, West Germany. About three
years old, they were bred in Auckland Zoo. The Kaka is a large parrot,
about 45 cm (19 in) in length. Its prominent beak, crimson hind neck
and orange-yellow ear coverts distinguish it. Like the Kea, to which it is
closely related, it is mainly a dull shade - greenish brown, whereas the
Kea is dark olive green.
Kakas were exhibited at London Zoo as long ago as 1863 and sub-
sequently in other European zoos. Auckland Zoo has been consistently
successful in breeding this highly unusual parrot since 1981. The three or
four eggs are incubated for 28 days. Newly hatched chicks are covered in
white down; they spend nine or ten weeks in the nest. In captivity they
feed on various seeds, fruits and vegetables, nectar and brown bread. Nec-
tar is an important part of their diet in the wild. When feeding on nectar
and pollen some of the latter adheres to their heads, resulting in cross-
pollination of flax and other plants. They also consume harmful insects
and grubs and therefore play a role of importance in the ecology of the
New Zealand forests. Their numbers have unfortunately declined appre-

ciably due to deforestation. Not common on North or South Islands,
they are more numerous on some of the small offshore islands.
Hopefully more Kakas will reach Europe, in order that this fascinating
parrot can be established in European aviculture.
Last year American aviculturist Sebastian Lousada produced seven
young Yellow-cheeked Amazons Amazona autumnalis autumnalis from
one pair. Removing the first clutch of Amazon eggs to an incubator
usually induces the female to lay again, thus the excellent results of
Mr. Lousada's pair. But why so notable? This Vermont breeder has no
mains electricity, thus the eggs were incubated in a Turn-X incubator
powered by solar electric panels! Are these the world's first solar powered
parrots?
Vermont is not, of course, one of the southern states. When he wrote
to me about this unusual breeding, there was a blanket of snow outside
his door. It is a good thing that Amazons are not winter breeders!

Several members of the Rallidae are spot-lighted in journals received
by the Avicultural Society in exchange for our Magazine. The spring
1986 issue of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds publication
Birds contains the results of a research project run in conjunction with
the NCC to discover the habitat requirements of the Corncrake. Under-
taken on the Hebridean islands of North and South Uist, the article
documents the species' habitat requirements throughout the breeding
season.
African Rallidae are discussed by Colin Wintle in an article in the Jan-
uary 1986 issue of the American Pheasant and Waterfowl Society Maga-
zine. Special attention is given to Flufftails (Sarothrura) and contains
some interesting facts.
In the same issue of A.P.W.S. the breeding of the Striped Crake
Porzana marginalis is documented and contains a wealth of information.
The colony of Griffon Vultures reintroduced into the Cevennes in
France continues to thrive and is now in its third spring. Forty-three
birds, including five chicks hatched in the wild, are now reported.
Australia's smallest parrot has been rediscovered in the foothills of
the Lemington Plateau in Queensland. Coxen's Fig Parrot Opqpsitta

instigated a search by the Royal Australian Ornithologists' Union. Two
birds were sighted on the New South Wales-Queensland border.
Cuba is the site for another important 'rediscovery'. This time the
species is the Ivory-billed Woodpecker Campephilus principalis bairdii ,
the island race endemic to Cuba. Sightings occurred in the mountains
some 500 miles east of Havana. Forestry operations close to where the
birds were seen have now ceased.
To complete the trio of rediscoveries, Jerdon's Courser Rhinoptilus
bitorquatus has been seen again for the first time since 1900. One was
seen in Ardhra Pradesh by a scientist working for the Bombay Natural
History Society. The area of scrub jungle where it was sighted is now
protected.
On 10th November 1986 the Wildfowl Trust celebrated its 40th
Anniversary. In that time a reputation has been built up that is second to
none, be it in research, captive breeding or presentation of a subject to
the general public.
The Trust's seven centres, dotted throughout the country, exhibit the
largest collection of waterfowl ever likely to be seen. In recent months
two species of special interest have been imported - the Freckled Duck
Stictonetta naevosa can be seen at Slimbridge and Blue Duck Hymeno-
laimus malacorhynchus at Arundel.
Waterfowl are not the only attraction to be found at the various
centres. Flamingoes have been very successful at Slimbridge and both
Martin Mere and Washington can boast the only entirely captive-bred
populations anywhere.
Hummingbirds are not species that you would normally associate with
a specialist waterfowl collection but over the years several have bred in
Slimbridge's tropical house and are still doing so.
The anniversary is commemorated in the latest issue of Wildfowl
World , the Trust's magazine. Articles cover a wide range of subjects,
illustrating much of the work the trust has done over the years.
The Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union's newsletter for March
1986 contains an article on the endangered species of Norfolk Island.
Ian Rooke carried out a survey of the island's wildlife and found that
several species are in grave danger of extinction, mainly through habi-
tat loss and competition from introduced species for available nest-
sites. The recently formed national park provides some hope but for
species like the Grey-headed Blackbird,help seems to have come too late.

Donald Risdon writes from the Tropical Bird Gardens, Rode, Somerset:
'I have recently observed a most unusual activity in Royal Starlings of
which I have four specimens.
'During the winter months these are housed in a greenhouse (slightly
heated which maintains an average temperature of 50*F). They occupy a
flight of about 12 ft by 3 ft by 4 ft high. Part of the floor of this flight is
covered with dry powdery peat.
'On two occasions recently (January 1967) I have seen them dusting
themselves by fluffing their feathers in the peat just like House Sparrows.
The motions are the same as when water-bathing. I have only seen them
doing this on two occasions, both when the daylight was fading just
after sunset. This was about a month ago, and, as far as I am aware, they
have not done it since.
'I mentioned this occurrence to Raymond Sawyer and apparently he
too has noticed it among his Royal Starlings.
'This seems so unusual in a group of birds which are keen water
bathers normally that I thought it worth while recording in the Magazine!

Dr. T.R. Birkhead writes from Sheffield University with a request for
information on the duration of fertility in birds:
'It has long been known that the females of several species of domesti-
cated birds are able to produce fertile eggs days or even weeks after the
removal of the male. The turkey currently holds the record; some female
turkeys have produced fertile eggs ten weeks after the last mating! At the
other extreme, pigeons and doves can retain their fertility for only six
days.
'The duration of fertility in other birds is poorly known, and such in-
formation could be important for those engaged in breeding hybrids or

colour breeding. I am sure many breeders must have had cases where
either the male has died, escaped or the pair split up, only for the female
to lay a clutch some time later. Since isolated females will often incubate
alone, there is a chance that breeders will also know whether the eggs
were fertile or not.
'I am conducting a survey on this topic and would be most interested
to hear from any bird breeders that have information of this sort. To be
most useful you need to have kept some records, and in particular it
would be valuable to know the following:

Mark Hagen write from Ontario, Canada, with news of an avicultural
research project which is being done with the University of Guelph as
part of his Master of Science degree:
'The project utilizes 15 pairs of Goffm's and an equal number of
Citron Cockatoos, as well as 80 various macaws, Amazon parrots, and
others. The Citrons will be bred using three different methods: one group
of five pairs will be randomly paired, a second group of five pairs will be
pair-bonded and a third group of five pairs will be colony-bred in cages
connected by long corridor cage. The cages for the Citrons are 8 x 6 x 6ft
We are also developing a water soluble powder of vitamins, minerals and
limiting amino acids, a hand-feeding formula and palatable pellets.
'The Coffins are presently housed in a climate-controlled room at the
University. Work on them will include determining the metabolizable
energy (ME) value of sunflower kernels, soy beans, and the effect of
naturally occurring intestinal parasites on these MEs. An attempt to
breed the Coffins, using light, temperature and humidity control will
also be part of the research. The other 100 parrots are housed in a 7,200
square feet warehouse off campus. The macaws are in suspended cages
that are supported by IVi in pipe on wheels and measure 12 x 6 x 6 ft.
The Amazon parrots and Sulphur-crested Cockatoos are in similar cages

THE BIRDS OF BURMA

B.E. Smythies. Nimrod Press, Hampshire. ISBN 1-85259-003-3. Price #45.
Those of us who are regularly frustrated by the gaps in the literature
on the birds of the Old World tropics will be delighted to know that the
long-awaited reprint of Bertram Smythies' Birds of Burma has now been
published. Those who know the early editions (1940 and 1953) from a
library or somebody's private collection, and have been waiting for years
for their own copy, whether secondhand or reprinted, will be surprised
to discover the book has grown. I mean physically ...... to coffee table
proportions. It is no longer a field guide, even by today's backpack stan-
dards, but a large and heavy volume. It is difficult to see the reasons,
presumably the market and profit opportunity for an expensive book of
this kind is considerably greater than that for a normal reference book.
Unfortunately it thus demands comparison with books of similar size
and cost, and falls short for such books are written with full descrip-
tions of the birds and illustrated with supporting distribution maps and
habitat-enriched portraits. Smythies' book was, and still is, a field reference
guide.
Having disposed of its physical and cost drawback, it is still the best
reference to the birds of Burma. The author was a member of the Burma
Forest Service for 15 years followed by another 15 years in Sarawak and
Brunei. During this latter period, while acting as Honorary Curator of
Birds in the Sarawak Museum he totally revised and updated The Birds of
Borneo. So he's a real field man drawing on a lifetime of personal prac-
tical field work. The list of references providing supplementary informa-
tion is long and very thorough. For all this though, the text is very
variable, both in quantity and quality. For example, on facing pages the
Purple Sunbird Nectarinia. asiatica , described as ' resident throughout
Burma' is given 30 lines of text which compares favourably with the
Purple-rumped Sunbird N. zeyloniea , described as 4 ..common in Ara-

km\ that gets only six lines, two of which are the name. In the former
the female is described simply as &amp;apos;...brown above and yellow below&amp;apos;. In
the latter case we are not told of the female at all.
As a finch specialist, I naturally turned to the last few pages and was
disappointed to read of the Pintailed Parrotfinch Erythmra prasirn pra-
sim that it is '..........a Malaysian species.,./ and the nest and eggs are 'un-
known'. Under the entry for the Scaly-breasted Munia. Lonchura punc~
tulata there is mention of two races, L.p. subundulata , and Lp, topela ,
but no hint of how the two races differ. This would be irritating, both to
the home-bound aviculturist and the bird watcher in the field, It is a
failing throughout the book.
Lest it seems as though I am overly distracted by the book's failings,
let me hasten to add that where there are notes on voice, habits and
food, nest and eggs, based on observations by the author, they are richly
informative and good reading. The illustrations are on 32 new plates
from the original artwork by A.M. Hughes. They are natural posture
portraits on a grey Ingres paper background and are first class reproduc-
tions. Of the almost 1000 species recorded in Burma, about 288 are ill-
ustrated.

THE SUNNING BEHAVIOUR OF BIRDS

tunities to observe the sunning (sun-bathing) behaviour of many species
and the often beautiful or bizarre postures that they adopt when so-
doing.
In this very 'meaty' and thought-provoking paperback book, Dr. Sim-
mons has investigated this behaviour in considerable detail and lucidly
describes his conclusions as to the stimuli eliciting it and its functions.
The book is well illustrated, by Robin Prytherch, with splendidly 'alive'
and impeccably accurate black and white drawings of about a hundred
different species in various sunning postures.

all its aspects, the chapter (pages 82-86) comparing it with other beha-
viour patterns serves, in effect, as an excellent introduction to and sum-
mary of water bathing, dusting and anting.
Much of the book is based on Dr. Simmons's own acute observations
but he has also consulted many other ornithologists, has thoroughly
researched the literature on the subject and the book is very fully
referenced.
To the reviewer, senile relict of a bygone age when it was safe to walk
alone in British cities, when the fanciers had not yet transformed our
Budgerigars from lively, beautiful and hardy birds to feathered monstros-
ities, and when paperbacked books cost 6d and hardbacks half-a-crown,
the price of this book at first seemed a lot. But of course it is not. As
things go today the pictures alone would be a bargain at the price.
The Sunning Behaviour of Birds can be heartily recommended to all
who are interested in bird behaviour and to all who delight in good
black and white drawings of birds.

Introduction
The penguin enclosure is located within an old walled garden area
of the Park and is roughly triangular in shape. It occupies a total area
of approximately 300 m , some 75 nr of which are taken up by a
pool. The maximum depth of the pool is one metre. The enclosure
is bounded on the south and west sides by the original 4 m high
boundary walls of the garden. Thus the enclosure faces generally north-
east and is viewed from along the north-east perimeter by visitors.
Visitors are separated from the enclosure by a 0.8 m high wall. The
penguins have access to the pool by means of a gently sloping concrete
ramp. This ramp also forms the route by which water flows into the pool
from an adjacent waterfall. During daylight hours the water is circulated
by means of a pump which takes water from the bottom of the pool and
then discharges it at the top of the waterfall. Once a week the pool is
emptied and scrubbed with dairy hypochlorite.
Located along the base of the high south and west walls of the
enclosure are 12 nest-boxes. These are approximately 1.2 m x 0.8 m x
0.6 m high and have an entrance situated at one end, i.e. s in one of
the shorter sides. Each entrance faces onto the main enclosure. A
wooden panel occupying half the width of the nest-box is situated
0.27 m inside the entrance to each box to act as a windbreak. The
nest-box lids consist of removable wooden panels which are covered
externally with waterproof sheeting. The nest-box floors also con-
sist of wood. During the summer months areas of shade within the
enclosure are provided by a tree, shrubs and vines. An artificial
rock cave provides shelter throughout the year. The enclosure pro-
vides accommodation for Humboldt Penguins Spheniscus humboldti

and Rockhopper Penguins Eudyptes crestatus. At the time of writing
(August 1983*) the colony consists of 5.5 breeding adult Humboldt
Penguins, 16 young park-bred Humboldt Penguins and 2.2 breeding
adult Rockhopper Penguins. Of the 5.5 breeding adult Humboldt
Penguins, 2.4 are from the original stock purchased in November
1969 and October 1970.
The remainder of this paper refers to Humboldt Penguins only.
Diet
All our penguins are fed on sprats Sprattus sprattus. Frozen sprats
are acquired from a fish supplier at regular intervals and stored at the
park. As satisfactory air thawing facilities are not available, the
frozen sprats are thawed by being placed in a container under running
tap water. Although the method of thawing is always similar, it has
been noticed that the quality of the thawed fish varies and presumably
this is related to the method of freezing and duration of storage. Fish
that are not firm to the touch when thawed are discarded as they are
usually rejected by the birds in any case. The penguins are given a
morning feed and an afternoon feed every day, except on Fridays
when the enclosure and pool are cleaned. Apart from any very young
birds recently introduced into the enclosure, the penguins are en-
couraged to take fish thrown into the pool.
During the afternoon feed only, one 300 mg NaCl tablet and one
Mazuri Fish Eaters' tablet are together inserted into the body cavity
of each of approximately 35 fish. The supplemented fish are tossed
into the pool although any young birds present are first given one
fish each directly by hand. It is therefore possible to ensure that on
most days each penguin receives a supplemented fish. On occasions
some birds take two or more supplemented fish but no ill effects
have been observed as a result of this. When all of the supplemented
fish have been consumed, the non-supplemented fish are thrown
into the pool.
Each penguin consumes approximately 0.5 kg of fish daily. This
amount varies, however, according to the time of year. During July
the penguins consume larger quantities of fish than at other times
and considerably increase their weight in preparation for the fast
during the annual moult in July/August. During the moult the pen-
guins consume scarcely any fish. Light feeding recommences towards
the end of the moult and the normal food intake is resumed gradually
over the following week or so.

Courtship
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983659076923077" page_id="56240517"  page_num="63" year="" vol="">
Once established, pair bondings have remained stable. This applies
to birds of the original stock and birds bred subsequently within the
colony. The breeding sites chosen by each pair, however, have not al-
ways remained constant from one breeding season to another. With the
exception of the moult period and a period of approximately six weeks
prior to it, our Humboldt Penguins have bred throughout the remainder
of the year. However, the main breeding period here is between February
and May. During the courtship period the penguins exhibit a marked
heightening of territoriality and calling becomes more frequent. The
territory of each pair appears to consist of a nest-box and an area of
approximately one square meter immediately outside the nest-box en-
trance. Should a penguin stray unintentionally within the territory
of another, the possessors of that territory initiate an exchange of
loud calling (braying) with the intruder. In some cases this is followed
by fighting. Such an exchange usually results in much braying within
the colony as a whole. On entering its own territory or meeting its
mate in a neutral area, each penguin sounds a recognition call. Court-
ship itself also involves loud braying as well as much neck and beak
touching between paired birds. During periods of breeding activity
the fleshy area at the base of the beak becomes swollen and reddish
in colour. In the males, which are larger than the females, this change is
more noticeable.
Nesting
Both adults incubate the eggs and share this duty on an approx-
imately equal basis, changeovers occurring several times throughout the
day and night. During the set feeding times the adult incubating at that
time usually remains in the nest-box while its mate feeds.
Observations here indicate that the incubation period for the Hum-
boldt Penguin is approximately 39 days and that incubation commences
immediately after the first egg is laid. The second egg is laid between
two and five days after the first.
Handrearing
After communicating with a number of other zoological establish-
ments and generally reappraising our approach, from mid-1980 we
adopted a policy of removing chicks from the parents immediately after
hatching. A rearing room was set up in the basement of one of the
animal kitchens, chosen because of its relatively cool and constant tem-
perature. An extractor fan was fitted to provide improved ventilation.
A Curfew still-air incubator was installed for rearing purposes and suf-

ficient working surface was made available for the handling of the
chicks.
In the light of experience since that time, the following procedures
are followed:
Nest-boxes in the main enclosure that are known to contain eggs due
to hatch are inspected at each feeding time. The newly-hatched chick is
removed from the nest-box immediately it is observed. Great care is
taken while removing the chick as the parents are extremely protective
at this time. However, within a few minutes after the removal of the
chick the parents exhibit no signs of distress or abnormal behavour. In
cases where a second egg is being incubated at the time of the removal
of a chick, the adult birds continue to incubate normally. As each
chick is removed from its nest-box it is marked on either a leg or flipper
for identification purposes by means of a harmless dye. It is then taken
to the rearing room and placed in the rearing incubator which is set
at a temperature of 32*C. The temperature is reduced gradually by
around 0.5*C daily until a temperature of 22*C is reached. The rate of
temperature reduction may vary slightly depending on the age of any
other chicks in the incubator.
A healthy, newly-hatched chick has a dry, downy appearance and
the yolk sac scar is dry and appears healthy. An egg tooth is visible on
the upper mandible. In many cases, swelling of the neck immediately
behind the head is observed. The extent of the swelling varies and
appears to be more pronounced in a chick that has had a difficult
hatch. However, some swelling is often seen in a chick that appears
to have had a normal hatch. This swelling of the neck has been des-
cribed by Dr. A.E. Anderson Brown (pers. comm.) as oedema of the
neck muscles and overlying tissues, resulting from excessive use of
those neck muscles during a prolonged or difficult hatch. The swelling
disappears on the first or second day after hatching in all cases.
As the still-air incubator is used for the rearing of chicks (as opposed
to the incubation of eggs) it is important to place simple barriers within
the chamber of the incubator in order to prevent the chick from
becoming too close to a heat source or becoming trapped in an awk-
ward space around the thermostat equipment. It is unnecessary to make
any special effort to control the relative humidity within the incubator.
Each day the chick is removed from the incubator for a brief period
during which time the incubator is cleaned thoroughly using hot soapy
water and a hand-brush. While in the incubator, the cluck rests on the
standard wire mesh egg tray through which its droppings pass on to a
removable sheet of paper below.
During the first 24 hours (day 1) it is unnecessary to feed the chick

as it has sufficient residual yolk to nourish it. Attempts to feed the
chick are made on day 2. Liquidised food is made up once a day. Ap-
proximately 300 g of whole sprats, a 5 ml measure of Vionate powder
and a pinch of calcium lactate powder are placed in a food liquidiser
and 120 ml of 1% saline solution are added, the mixture being blended
to a smooth consistency. Some of this mixture is placed in a 60 ml
bladder syringe. The syringe is placed in a beaker of hot water until the
temperature of the food is about 38*C, the approximate temperature
of the regurgitated food that the chick would receive from its parents.
The food is then fed immediately to the chick. The remaining liquidised
food is placed in a refrigerator until required for the following feed, any
unused food being discarded at the end of each day.
The chick is removed from the incubator for feeding and is held in
an upright position in one hand. The forefinger of the same hand is
used to raise the chick's head and open the bill. Great care is used at all
times. The syringe containing liquidised food is held in the other hand
and the syringe nozzle, which in the bladder syringe is around 35 mm
long, is inserted gently into the chick's mouth, over the glottis and into
the back of the throat. A small quantity of food, perhaps 1-3 ml, is
then expelled gently from the syringe. This action initiates the chick's
swallowing reflex and the nozzle is withdrawn from the mouth until the
food has been swallowed. This process is repeated until approximately
5 ml of food have been consumed. The chick gradually becomes accus-
tomed to the feeding routine and by day 3 it begins to accept food
from the syringe voluntarily, increasing quantities being consumed
from that time. During the first 48 hours the chick loses from around
5-10 g in weight. The first weight gain occurs around day 4 (see graph).
By the second week the chick is entirely accustomed to the feeding
routine and the presence of one of the handlers is sufficient to cause
it to vocalise and the raise its head, indicating its readiness to take food.
The young chick rests on the tarsometatarsus at this stage.
During the first four weeks or so the chick is fed three times per
day using the above mixture and procedure. The feeding times are
approximately 0800, 1200 and 1700 hours. Care is taken not to over-
feed the chick at any one feed as over-distention of the gut at this
stage can give rise to vomiting and other complications.
Chicks showing weight gains that are significantly higher or lower
than the mean during the first few weeks are often associated with
intestinal infections, vomiting and a general failure to thrive or, in a few
cases, to survive. Certain precautions are thus taken with all chicks to
ensure acceptable weight gains during this period. The abdomen is
manipulated gently with the fingertips before and during feeds so that

the handler can gain some impression of the volume of food in the gut
and can thus avoid overfeeding. It is preferable to underfeed slightly
than to overfeed. A chick exhibiting weight gains that are below average
may benefit from an additional feed per day for a few days.
A chick that is weak or unwell may refuse food and its mouth is
examined for any signs of infection as is also the cloacal vent to con-
firm that excreta are being passed freely. A weak chick may also be un-
able to assume the correct posture in which to defaecate and excreta
may then accumulate and solidify around the cloacal vent .Close obser-
vation of the faeces is maintained constantly as the presence of blood in
the faeces usually indicates an infection requiring veterinary treatment.
During the first seven to ten days a yolk sac infection may develop.
However, it is not usually possible to confirm such an infection until
after the death of the chick.
To a certain extent it is possible to maintain chicks of various ages
at the same temperature in the same incubator. However, it is not re-
commended that a newly-hatched chick be placed in the same incubator
with older chicks when the temperature in the incubator is less than
32*C. It is also undesirable to maintain a chick of three weeks old or
more at a temperature of over 29*C. Thus we eventually found it
necessary to purchase a second still-air incubator for use as a brooder.
The chick is removed from the incubator when around 26 days old as
at this age it becomes too large for the incubator chamber. The chick
is then placed in a circular, open-topped container approximately one
metre across, the sides consisting of a length of rolled hardboard. The
base of the container consists of a fine wire mesh which is raised
slightly above removable sheets of paper. The container is heated by
means of an overhead heat lamp and, by positioning the lamp correctly,
a temperature gradient is initially maintained of from 21*C down to
16*C throughout the day and night. When around 850 g in weight (day
30) the chick no longer requires a heat lamp and subsequently the lamp
is used only if the temperature drops below 10*C.
Once the chick weighs about 950 g (day 30) it is weaned on to
sprat pieces taken from filleted sprats with the head and tail also
removed. Thus at this time the chick consumes around 50 ml of liqui-
dised food plus around 40 g of sprat pieces at each of its three feeds
per day. The sprat pieces are moistened with 1% saline solution or
water to facilitate swallowing. It may be necessary to coax the chick
into accepting these fish pieces by stroking its throat while it is being
fed. However, the chick soon becomes accustomed to this addition to
its diet and during the next few days the sprat pieces are increased and
the liquidised food decreased.

By around 1.1 kg in weight (day 36) the chick is fed entirely on sprat
pieces moistened with saline solution or water. The approximate intake is
80-90 g per feed. As at this stage the chick no longer receives the vitamin
and mineral supplement previously included with the liquidised food, a
dusting of calcium lactate and Vionate powders on the moistened fish
pieces providing the necessary dietary supplements.
When the chick weighs around 1.4 kg (day 40), headless and tailless
non-filleted sprats are introduced and increased gradually to replace a
roughly equivalent quantity of sprat pieces. Whole sprats, i.e., including
the head and tail, are introduced at around day 43.. At around this time
the chick ceases to stand on the tarsometatarsus and extends the lower
limb to stand on its phalanges.
By around 1.7 kg in weight (day 46) the chick's food consists en-
tirely of whole sprats and the number of feeds is decreased to two per
day, one at 0800 and one at 1700 hours. Approximately 100 g of sprats
are consumed during each feed, the total daily consumption thus
showing a small temporary decrease. One half of a Mazuri Fish Eaters
tablet and one half of a salt tablet are inserted into the body cavity of
one of the sprats given to each chick per day.
At this age the chick, together with any others of similar age, is
placed in a separate pen within the main penguin enclosure during the
day, provided that the weather is not too cold or wet. This pen has
wire mesh sides that protect the chick from minor bullying by the
more inquisitive members of the colony. A piece of roofing sheet or
similar material is placed over part of the pen in order to give protec-
tion from the sun or rain. The pen has an open base so that the chick's
feet rest directly on the grass or small pebbles of the enclosure. The
chick and its pen are moved to a covered area of the enclosure at night
for additional protection from adverse weather.
Assimilation into the colony
The initial introduction to the main enclosure of the penguin chick
inside its pen results in one of two general reactions from members of
the colony. As already noted, the colony at the Cotswold Wildlife Park
is composed of both Humboldt and Rockhopper Penguins and while
most hand-reared individuals of both species exhibit some interest in
the new chick, most wild-caught individuals ignore it.
At around day 55 the juvenile plumage begins to replace the down
feathers, always commencing on the flippers. Once around half the
juvenile plumage has appeared, i.e. at around day 70, the chick is re-
moved from its pen by day and is allowed to move freely within the
colony. However, for the first few days it is caught up and placed back

in the pen at night. The newly-released chick is usually ignored by the
paired adults. The sub-adult Humboldt Penguins, however, may bully
the chick somewhat for a few days. This reaction may be due to the
need to establish a pecking order. However, within a week of its intro-
duction the chick appears to attract no further attention and is no
longer placed inside the protective pen at night.
The newly-released chick has free access to the pool and while some
chicks enter the water almost immediately, others take a day or so
longer. The chick's ability to swim appears to be instinctive although
during the first few days its movements are somewhat unco-ordinated.
However, its swimming ability improves rapidly. Any down remaining
at this time is quickly lost during swimming and subsequent preening.
Within a week of entering water for the first time, the chick is en-
couraged by the handler to accept food from the hand while in the
water. Thus the chick gradually learns to feed while swimming and
eventually dives and competes for fish with the adults.
Abandoned eggs
There have been occasions when eggs were abandoned by the adult
birds during incubation. On one occasion a clutch of two eggs was
parent-incubated beyond the 30th day, i.e., the eggs were both within
seven to ten days of hatching. As soon as the abandonment was observed
the eggs were removed from the nest-box and placed in an incubator.
Enquiries were made concerning penguin incubation temperatures and
one experienced source advised that the eggs be incubated at a tempera-
ture of between 35.5*C and 35.8*C at 60% humidity. This advice was
followed and both chicks began to pip normally. However, on the
second day in each case it appeared that the shell membranes were
drying out and that the chick was adhering to them. Warm water was
then sprayed regularly from a fine spray onto the egg, internal mem-
branes and the emerging chick. Both chicks were still unable to com-
plete the hatching process and thus a pair of blunt forceps was used
gradually to remove pieces of shell until the chicks were free. The
chicks were subsequently hand-reared and reunited with the main colony
as described above.
Subsequently, another clutch of two eggs was abandoned within a
day of the second egg being laid. These eggs were placed in an incubator
and were successfully hatched and the chicks reared, this time without
any hatching difficulties.

Of the 40 species of so-called true crows in the family Corvidae,
the Mariana or Guam Crow Corvus kubaryi is one of the least studied
and only the Hawaiian Crow C. hawaiiensis is rarer.
The only corvid in Micronesia, it is found only on the Western Pacific
islands of Guam and nearby Rota. On Rota, the viability of the crow
population is unknown, and on Guam, a U.S. territory, it is in danger of
becoming extinct as a result of several factors, the most serious of which
is now the introduced Brown Tree Snake Boiga irregularis. Basically a
nocturnal reptile, this snake is a specialised predator of birds and their
eggs. Either accidentally or deliberately introduced into Guam in the
1940s, the Brown Tree Snake is now thought to be the primary cause
of the near extirpation of the entire native forest avifauna of the island.
Nesting crows had not been observed since 1983 (R.E. Beck, pers.
comm.). In 1984 the crow was one of five species and subspecies en-
demic to Guam which were added to the U.S. Federal Endangered
Species List. The population of the crow on Guam was then estimated
to have been as low as 50. And, at that date, very little else was known
about it.
1985 as a representative of the Philadelphia Zoological Garden with the
goal of studying this little-known species which was fast disappearing on
the island. During two months there, I studied the breeding biology and
ecology of the species. The field work was done at the invitation of, and
in association with, the Guam Division of Aquatic and Wildlife Resources
(GDAWR). Since the Philadelphia Zoo has led a programme among
several U.S. zoos to preserve the remaining forest birds of Guam through
captive propagation, my mission was to study the crow in its natural
habitat in an attempt to gain insight into its captive breeding needs. The
data gathered in the field would be interpreted to simulate the natural
requirements of the species in captivity in order to maximise the chances
of successful propagation.

U.S. Air Force, I received permission to have access to jungle forests off-
limits to the public. The site of the study area was Andersen Air Force
Base, a U.S. military post at the northern end of the 32 km-long by 16
km-wide island. To date, much of the land on the base has been undis-
turbed for at least 40 years and, as an area off-limits to the public, has
been preserved from the general expansion of human population and
commercialisation on Guam. There the last remnant climax or well-dev-
eloped forests remain. Fortunately, the military also considers the area a
wildlife sanctuary.
From 22nd September to 24 November, I logged from 56 to 77 hours
of field observations each week. Zoo and GDAWR officials had hoped
that the two-month period would provide ample time for observation of
a complete nesting from egg-laying to fledging of young. Although the
crow was thought to nest year-round, the information available on its
breeding biology indicated a heightened period of egg-laying from Sept-
ember to November, or from the latter portion to the end of the four- to
six-month long tropical wet season. Of course, a pair of active nesting
adults had to be located before anything could be achieved.
Since this wary and shy species has historically fled expanding human
population, a bird-observation blind was used to observe the sexual
differences, food habits, adult pair behaviour, and nesting activity, and
to record vocalisations at close range. Discovering the crow's indifference
to stationary automobiles, I found that I could also use my vehicle as an
acceptable blind in the woodland at times. A heavily used, grid-like road
system through the forest on the base had accustomed a large sample of
the crow population to vehicular traffic. As a consequence, my auto-
mobile became useful in observing intra- and interspecific relations and in
determining territory sizes.
To conduct a census, I played a particular crow call on a cassette tape
player. This lured live crows to the source of the call and, therefore,
within sight. At this time GDAWR field biologists are evaluating this
method as a means of censusing the species.

A typical crow in body and colour, the Guam species can be described
simply as a smaller and duller version of the common North American
Crow C. brachyrhynchos . But, to be more specific, it has brown, short
wings, a green gloss to the head plumage, and a blue gloss to the body
plumage. The beak and feet are black. There is a slight sexual dimor-
phism in the species; the adult female is not as robust as the male, and
her plumage has a brownish cast. These characteristics, though subtle,

are reliable in identifying the sexes of a pair in the field.
Young birds are described as being like typical crow juveniles (Tom-
back, unpubl 1980). Unkempt in appearance, the juveniles have short,
fluffy head plumage and wing feathers which may be worn at the ends.
Where dark contour feathers on the breast are disarranged, exposed
feather bases show as light patches. Body plumage lacks the gloss of the
adults', and ranges from chocolate-brown to blackish brown.
The populations of the species on Guam and Rota are described as
identical in appearance.
Feeding habits
An omnivore, the Mariana Crow forages most commonly in the
jungle understory, in the forest canopy, and occasionally on the forest
floor. Marshall (1949) reported that the diet included miscellaneous
plant material, flowers, insects, lizards and birds. Jenkins (1983) reported
them as eating seeds, fruits, foliage, birds, bark and arthropods.
My observations of the foraging activity of breeding and non-breeding
birds occurred during the wet season and the beginning of an early dry
season. Those birds which I observed were highly carnivorous during
these times. Food items included seeds, fruits, arthropods and lizards. On
one occasion I witnessed a crow eating a Brown Tree Snake approximately
0.3 m long.
Crows under observation frequented Cocos nucifera, Pandanus sp.,
Ficus sp. and Artocarpus sp. in search of animal foods. They collected
seeds from miscellaneous plants, but, in my period of observation, chose
mainly various ficus fruits. Arthropods, lizards and the one snake seen
eaten were extracted from crevices at the bases of coco fronds and pan-
danus leaves. Crows also frequently caught insects and lizards on ficus in
the understory; they also commonly gathered insects from dead arto-
carpus. In this case, the birds would deliver woodpecker-like blows to the
branches and then tear off bark and dead wood in search of boring in-
sects. This method of feeding upon insects may have given rise to the
eating of bark by the species. Although my data are insufficient to refute
the findings of Jenkins (1983), they do suggest that the crow eats neither
foliage nor bark. Crows hold both vegetable and animal foods with the
feet and tear off bite-size pieces with the beak. While watching crows
foraging in pandanus, I discovered one of their water sources. Leaves
which grow at the terminal end of pandanus branches form a natural cup
that holds rainwater, and crows have learned to utilise this resource.
Vocalisations
The adult Mariana Crow demonstrated five different types of vocali-

sations during my field observations on Guam. The locational or identi-
fication call, a higher pitched version of the caw of the North American
Crow, was most often heard. The call was used to identify the caller or
to indicate the caller's location. Only used by a member of a pair to
communicate with its mate, the call was ignored when elicited by a
third bird. On one occasion, the individuals of a pair, visually isolated
while foraging some 55 m apart, maintained a dialogue of locational
or identification caws for 22 minutes. Alternating, the birds called
approximately every 15 seconds. In addition to using It when foraging,
the crow also produced this vocalisation when perched, when flying,
when chasing an intruder in its territory, when accompanying its mate
in a chase, and when flying as a flock member.
The alarm call consisted of a series of rapid identification caws. This
was heard when a bird or its mate faced crow or human intruders and
was startled.
The harsh locational caw was a loud, low-pitched guttural squall used
by breeding and non-breeding pairs at nest sites. When producing this
call, the bird assumed a parallel or horizontal position to the perch,
ruffled its body plumage, fanned its tail feathers, and raised and lowered
its closed wings. Although both sexes used this call, the male produced
it more frequently. Among situations in which this vocalisation was
heard were the following: when the crow was perched in the nest tree
or occupying the nest as an intruding crow or crows flew through the
territory; when one crow was at the nest as its mate landed nearby; when
the female was at the nest during a chase of intruding crows by the male;
when a bird was adding nesting material to the nest; when it was respond-
ing to the same call from another bird. Individual crows or flocks could
be lured to the sound of broadcasts of this call.
The monologue , composed of several whines and gurgling sounds, was
heard when the adult pair foraged together.
The hunger call consisted of a series of gurgled aaa or nr sounds
accompanied by wing flutters. This call was produced by the female only.
She engaged in this when the male fed her; she called when foraging with
her mate and when incubating at the nest.
The vocalisations of subadult crows have been described by Tomback
(unpubl. 1980). On one occasion I observed two subadults on the wing
in pursuit of an adult. Both were producing a series of whiney, high-
pitched caws.
Breeding behaviour
During my two months on Guam, I was able to observe two pairs of
crows engaged in nesting activity. One pair was first observed building a

nest shortly after my arrival but had not yet completed it at the date of
my departure. A second nesting pair, discovered five weeks after my
arrival and then just beginning to construct a nest, was the first active
nesting observed in recent years. Although this pair did not produce
young, the activities of this pair, combined with observations of the
other pair, added to the understanding of nest construction, the roles
of male and female in nesting, and their relationship to other crows.
Beginning on 22nd October, I observed the entire construction of
a nest by the second pair. Near the crown of a live, 12 m Elaeocarpus
sphaericus, the nest site was in a cradle of 5-8 cm branches growing
first horizontally and then vertically. Foliage shaded the nest-site the
entire day. (All the old crow nests which I found in the forest, except
one at approximately 6 m in an hernandia tree, were located at about
12 m in an Eleaocarpustree in branches as described above.).
Constructed in seven days, the nest was composed entirely of eleao-
carpus twigs, soft fibres of dead coco palm fronds, and pandanus leaves.
It was begun as a ring of 0.6 cm twigs to which other twigs were added
for five days.
Both sexes engaged in nest construction. They also collected twigs
together, flying to an elaeocarpus within their territory and returning
with beaks full of twigs. The birds hopped about branches and snapped
off dead twigs with the beak. As they collected the material, they fre-
quently engaged in the monologue vocalisations described earlier.
During the construction of the nest cup within the twigs, the female
spent two days stripping long pieces of dead coco palm frond or panda-
nus leaves from plants growing near the nest site. Upon adding this
material to the nest, she formed the inner cup by moving her breast
from side to side. Construction by the female of the inner cup occurred
during the entire day, as had construction of the outer nest by both
sexes earlier. During the construction period I was not able to locate
the roosting site of the pair.
On the seventh day of construction, copulation was observed at the
nest. Monologue-type vocalisations by both birds accompanied the act.
The female also completed the cup structure that day. The overall di-
mensions of the completed nest were 41 cm by 30 cm by 10 cm deep.
The inner cup measured 13 cm by 13 cm and was 4 cm deep at its
centre. The elaeocarpus twigs surrounding the soft, well-structured cup of
coco palm and pandanus fibres ranged from 0.2 cm to 0.6 cm in diameter
and were 1 5 cm to 20 cm in length.
On the eighth day an egg was laid. During this day the female sat in
the nest for extended periods in the morning and sporadically in the
afternoon. The male was not attentive to her during these periods. When

she was not on the nest, the pair foraged together in the thick understory
no more than 27 m from the nest. On the ninth day incubation apparently
began. The female remained quietly on the nest all day except for four
periods of 15 minutes or less of foraging within, again, 27 m of the nest site.
During her foraging periods, usually twice in the morning and twice
in the afternoon, the male performed incubation duties. She never left
the nest unless he was nearby. Upon her leaving, he immediately began
incubation and did not leave the nest until her return. On several occasions
she perched in the nest tree and preened before returning to the nest. The
relationship of the pair followed this routine throughout the time of incu-
bation.
The male was very attentive to the nest and his mate. In addition to
actively guarding the nest and the pair's territory and relieving the female
in incubation duties, he also fed the incubating female. Throughout the
day, the male remained close to the nest site, primarily either guarding the
nest or foraging within the area. At least twice an hour he fed the incuba-
ting female. Upon his arrival at the nest, she produced a hunger call and
fluttered her wings, begging for the food item. All food items were carried
whole in the beak.
During the cool early morning and less frequently at dusk, the male
foraged in open sunlit areas, but spent the late morning and afternoon in
the shaded forest understory. On cooler and cloudier days, activity in open
areas increased. Foraging activity ceased, with the advent of rain.
Showers were frequent in the wet season. As soon as a shower began,
crows dived into the understory and remained there until the rain ceased.
Then the crows ascended to the tops of tall, dead trees and, facing into the
wind, preened and fanned their wings to dry their plumage.
When the male was not foraging, he usually perched just below the nest
or at the crown of an adjacent tree some 14 m up, viewing the entire terri-
tory. Much of the morning, the most active period for individual crows or
flocks, was spent by the male in escorting birds out of the 1.9 km^ terri-
tory. (A typical crow territory varied between 1.6 and 2.6 km^.) Upon
sighting an intruder, the male gave a harsh outcry of a caw and flew several
metres behind the individual crow or flock until it (they) left the territory. If
an intruder's flight was going to impinge directly upon the nest tree, the
male altered the other crow's course by dogging it with repeated inter-
ception flights. In these drives physical contact was infrequent, but once,
as a part of a 20-minute long chase, an intruding male from an adjacent
territory was grasped by the feet of the pursuing male. They fell approxi-
mately 18 m before separating at a metre above the ground. This was the
longest chase observed, but the total time spent by the male in active
defence of the territory averaged 2-3 hours per morning.

Upon examination of the nest on 31st October, a single egg was found.
It was light blue with chocolate brown flecks. The egg was neither meas-
ured nor weighed for fear of damaging it or causing nest desertion* It
was, however, roughly estimated to be 30-35 mm x 20-25 mm in size. On
the 20th day of incubation, the pair abandoned the nest. When the nest
was examined, it was found to be empty. Since the nest site had been
snake-proofed with a metal collar, the egg had probably been infertile and
had been removed by the birds at the end of the incubation period. GDAWR
officials and I had estimated that the incubation period would be 18-21
days in length.
This unfortunate turn of events obviously precluded any observation of
parental care of the young. However, Jenkins (1983) reported that both
sexes engage in feeding the young.
Family groups
During my stay on Guam, I was able to observe briefly only one family
group consisting of two subadults and one adult. The young birds could be
identified by their chocolate brown plumage and loud, insistent whining
calls. The three birds were observed as transients flying through the terri-
tory of the nesting pair. The young trailed a metre or less in flight behind
the adult, which appeared to be a female.

Flocks
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.969206411764706" page_id="56240534"  page_num="80" year="" vol="">
Flocks under observation varied from 3-13 in number. Jenkins (1983)
had observed a flock of 14 individuals. Three flocks composed of 5, 9
and 11 members were seen with frequency. These groups appeared to be
separate and static in number, but limitations of observation prevented
any analysis of flock structure or function. Except for the one occasion
mentioned above, flocks did not seem to represent family groups either
behaviourally or physically.
Interspecific interactions
Few interactions between the Mariana Crow and other species of birds
were observed. Crows, both in flight and while foraging, were buzzed or
physically attacked by the introduced Black Drongo Dicrurus macrocercus
At times crows fled from these attacks; at others, they ignored such antag-
onistic behaviour. On one occasion, when a transient drongo flew near a
crow nest site, the occupying crow responded with a harsh vocalisation
and aggressive posture, but did not pursue the intruding bird.
Population
Historically, the Mariana Crow ranged over much of Guam (Jenkins,

1983). The species was once common throughout the mature and second-
growth forests of the entire northern half of the island and in the many
ravine forests of the mountainous southern savanna, but it has greatly
declined in numbers and area inhabited since the 1960s (Jenkins, 1983).
During my stay on Guam, I found crows only in mature and second-
growth forest and coastal strand vegetation on the northern third of the
island.
Estimates of the current population vary considerably. Since the
crows are both highly mobile and wary, they are more often heard than
seen. As a consequence, a totally unreliable census method has been un-
available. However, using a previously untried method, I estimated a
population at the time of 100 crows, of which only three juveniles or sub-
adults were observed. My census method consisted of playing a cassette
recording of the harsh locational or squall call (the only call to which
breeding and non-breeding birds consistently responded) every 0.5 km
hi the northern third of the island. This method is currently being eval-
uated by GDAWR field biologists.

Although the complete biology of the Mariana Crow or of any species
cannot be determined in a two-month period, my field work represents
the most complete study of the species to date. Application of the know-
ledge gained through this field study to wildlife biologists' management of
the species in the wild and to future propagation programmes in zoos
could contribute greatly in the ultimate conservation of the species. The
data gathered on identification of sexes, behaviour of nesting birds, nor-
mal social behaviour of the species and interpretation of vocalisations
provide information useful in the long-term management, especially in
captivity, of the species. Knowing this information, zoo personnel can
simulate a more natural and less stressful captive environment more
conducive to successful maintenance and propagation of the species. Al-
though no crows have thus far been collected from the wild for captive
propagation efforts, the results of the field work have already proven of
value to the understanding by wildlife biologists of the natural history
of the bird and in conducting a more accurate census on Guam (R.E.
Beck, pers, comm.).

My first experience with the Saffron Finch was as a lad, shortly
after the war. In those days our (a short-lived trio of a partnership)
bird-keeping was very much of the home-grown variety and the only
bird we could afford to buy was a cast-off hen canary, which was kept
in a converted soap-box by a close friend of mine. Our ambition was to
obtain a fine cock finch of some kind and run it with the canary. Then
we would soon all have birds of our own. I saw an advertisement on a
postcard in a newsagent's showcase: 'For Sale. Cock Saffron Finch,
lovely condition', and there was an address nearby. A cousin and I soon
found ourselves in the attic flat of a pensioner who I seem to remember
had a dozen or more cages with canaries, mostly double-breeders.
There, in a budgie show cage, was an immaculate and beautiful Saffron
Finch.
"What d'yer want it fer?", and we explained our desire to find a
good cock finch to run with our hen canary. " 'Course it'll breed beauti-
fully wf canary. But I want 7/6d."
We went off to consult with the third member of our bird-keeping
trio, the boy who had the canary. Seven-and sixpence was a lot for us
then (about 37 p today!) as we only made 2/6d delivering newspapers.
What decided against it for us though was the question raised by the
canary-owner, but unanswered by any of us: "If it's such a good breeder
with a canary, why didn't he do it then?" Our instincts were correct,
of course, for the genus Sicalis is far removed from Serinus. In fact,
the Saffron Finch might not even be a finch at all!
It is an easy bird to describe. The adult male is greenish yellow
above, pure yellow below. The forehead is orange. The flight feathers
are blackish, edged with yellow. The bill is horn with the upper man-
dible darker than the lower, the iris is brown, the feet flesh-coloured.
In size it is about the same as a House Sparrow. The adult female Is very
similar but can be told apart more easily in some races than others.
Generally, she Is a little duller, slightly more streaked above, the orange
of the forehead being less bright and less extensive. In size, she is a
little smaller on average.
I am indebted to Franz Robiller for information on races and distri-
bution of them. The nominate Sicalis flaveola flaveola (Linnaeus):

ROBIN L. RESTALL - SAFFRON FINCH
Venezuela, north Columbia, introduced to Jamaica; S.f. braziliensis
(Gmelin): north-east and south-east Brazil; &amp;f pelzelni (Sclater): south
Brazil, south Bolivia, north Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay; S. f. valida
(Bangs and Perrard): south-west Ecuador, north-west Peru. The nomi-
nate race was introduced to Trinidad and Tobago from Venezuela, and
to Panama from Colombia (ffrench).
The Brazilian/Argentinian race is usually referred to as Pelzeln's
Saffron Finch in the literature. It is the smallest of the races and is
further distinguished by being streaked on the flanks. The Peruvian
race is referred to by advertisers, invariably, as the Giant Saffron Finch.
Indeed, it is the largest race, and is the one that is regularly impor-
ted into England. Pelzeln's bird is occasionally available on the con-
tinent but I can't recall seeing it advertised. The other two races are
never available. I have not kept Pelzeln's Saffron Finch, but as far as I
can tell from the literature, it requires the same treatment and has ex-
actly the same behaviour as the Peruvian and Venezuelan races, both of
which I am very familiar with. There is an excellent account of it by
Arthur Butler in his classic Foreign Finches in Captivity , as relevant
today as when it was written.
The Peruvian race is the most difficult to identify, for the sexes are
very similar. In several known true pairs I have found the male to be
slightly larger, bolder and more strongly coloured, but these are birds
of approximately the same age. From young birds of this race that I
have bred myself, I have had the same difficulty and must conclude
that there is no consistent difference in plumage between the sexes in
fledgeling or juvenile plumage. Please note that Saffron's Finches
may not acquire full adult definitive plumage until their third year,
invariably their second year, and will not only pair up but will breed
in the juvenile plumage.
The Venezuelan race can be told apart at any age. The band of
yellow suffusion across the breast and nape of the neck in fledglings is
about 30.0% to 50.0% broader in young males. In second year birds this
is singularly apparent. In full adults the female's mantle is noticeably
more olivaceous, while the orange forehead extends to the crown on
the male bird.
The contact call of the Saffron Finch is a zitt , quite penetrating and
difficult to locate. There is a short but elaborate greeting call and dis-
play, when birds known to each other will raise their bills skywards in
the manner of American grackles. Indeed all of the display between
paired birds and birds known to each other reminds me of cowbirds and
grackles. The song of a healthy male is persistent and regular. It is not
of the quality of Sporophila seedeaters, but is nonetheless a pleasant

sound. It is very much part of the background noise around the house
and garden of anyone who has lived in Saffron Finch country. For an
expatriate European it replaced the chirruping song of the House
Sparrow (but if only the House Sparrow could chirrup thus!).
During my three years' residency in Venezuela I had plenty of op-
portunity to study the Saffron Finch, For over a year during which I
lived in an apartment block on one of the many hillsides of Caracas, I
followed the routine of setting one or two trap cages baited with fruit,
mealworms or seed in one corner or other of the garden. My objective
was to catch and band the birds in the vicinity and be able to identify
them subsequently when flying free. A pair of Saffron Finches were
resident, nesting in a hole by a water tank in the penthouse above our
apartment, and they were daily visitors to our balcony. The similarity
in behaviour between the Saffron Finch and the House Sparrow is
interesting, and not simply because of its preference for nesting in the
eaves of a house. Incidentally, the Venezuelan name for the bird is
Canario de tejado which means canary of the rooftop. The pair seems
to be very firmly bonded, each following the other as they go about
their territory It is rare to find a solitary Saffron Finch, and as a rule, a
lone bird on the lawn suggests the other (usually the female) is on the
nest.
They are very intelligent birds. Having caught one of a pair, the only
way to catch the other is to use its mate as a decoy. Once caught it is
extremely unusual to catch the same bird twice, and never in the same
trap or the same location. One pair I caught 1 kept for a while and
their territory was soon taken by a pair of birds in juvenile plumage.
When released the old pair quickly reclaimed their territory, and saw
the innocent usurpers off. From time to time 1 would catch birds in
juvenile or near-adult plumage and could usually catch the partner
for despite the presence of the resident full-colour birds, the un-caught
bird would not leave without its mate.
The loss of a mate does not result in the widow (or widower)
remaining single for long, I have found it relatively easy to replace
lost birds with an acceptable new spouse.
Saffron Finches are birds of parkland, gardens, town and village.
They seem to be found as close to man as the House Sparrow is and
offhand I cannot recall catching it at any of the study areas out in the
deep countryside. The comparison with the House Sparrow is deliberate
for it appears to be one of the few species that has not been ousted from
its habitat by that introduced interloper. Indeed, the range of the
House Sparrow in South America seems to have been limited by the
resistance of the Saffron Finch, In Jamaica! understand that the Saffron

Finch was introduced after the House Sparrow, and successfully sup-
planted it.
Saffron Finches walk, not hop, and normally feed on the ground
searching for fallen seeds and other edible matter. They can be main-
tained successfully on a standard foreign finch mixture of millets and
canary seed, plus some other supplements. Bird I have kept have eaten
apple, orange and most fruits; seeding grasses and greenfood may be
taken. Water should be in drinking and bathing containers as they love
bathing and this should be remembered when planning housing. Grit
is essential, as is cuttlefish 'bone'. In my planted aviary I have watched
my adult Saffrons biting pieces from the edges of the leaves of most
every plant, including laurel.
They are easy cage birds to keep and maintain in good condition
whether accommodation is a relatively modest cage or a roomy aviary.
They have bred often enough in cages to prove this. In my experience
they are at their best in an aviary with a shelter or indoor enclosure.
This permits the female to escape the male when his mating overtures
become overly aggressive. It seems as though some chasing and aggres-
sion is necessary to stimulate ovulation by the female. In my earlier
notes (Restall, 1975) I described the species as having a tendency to
be 4 . rumbustious and rather bullying. The two sexes engage in a
lively courtship. When breeding they are not suitable birds for crowded
aviaries.' Having written that advice for the world at large, some 15
years ago, I recently acquired some Peruvian Saffrons and eventually
placed a pair in my large, planted and .dare I admit it? .over-
crowded aviary.
The problems began when the hen went down and began to lay.
The displays of territorial defence by the male became quite aggressive.
Round about this time I had been forced (?) by lack of space elsewhere
(plus the usual pressure of optimism and wishful thinking) to add a trio
of Puna Yellow Finches Sicalis luteo. These birds had been very passive
in a cage, bickering vociferously otherwise sitting almost sullenly. In
the aviary they came to life. The two cocks chased each other about
and whenever one was in the flight (the other being indoors) it sang
very sweetly indeed. A week or so after their introduction my wife
called me urgently and we watched horrified as the two Saffron Finches,
working as a beautifully coordinated team, attacked one of the Puna
Yellow Finches. The three, locked together, fell to the ground feathers
flying. I ran into the garden clapping my hands and shouting. I prompt-
ly removed the innocents and in the doing found the Saffron Finches'
nest. In it I could feel, but not see, tiny bodies.
The nest was in a bank of hay built in a tenement frame on a wall

inside the shelter. It is a nesting site I learned from Mike Fidler and has
proved to be the most acceptable - and successful - device that I have
ever used to encourage nesting. Since building the original wooden
frame some 3 ft wide x 4 ft deep x 8 in from to-back (0.91 x 1.22 x
0.002 m), lined with large hole (3 in - 0,075 rn) plastic garden mesh
and stuffed with hay, grasses and fir branches, I have developed a figure-8
double roll that has encouraged Saffron Finches, muni as . seedeaters and
bulbuls, Cuban Finches and waxbihs, all to build, lay and (sometimes)
successfully rear young.
Within a few days - during which time I was out of the country on
one of my too-frequent business trips - three birds were killed, all inside
the shelter. Upon my return I promptly took the nestlings out of the nest
in the hope that such action would knock the Saffrons 'out of synch'
in their breeding cycle, and may be put them back into courtship and
nest-site prospecting. This it did, and to my delight this time, they chose
a hanging terracotta pot. This kind of utensil is sold in the United States
for birdlovers .anxious to attract breeding birds to their gardens. That
brood was deserted unfortunately, due to my inspection, I am sure. The
nestlings were about three or four days old, and I was due to fly to
Germany for a couple of days. I reckoned that upon my return they
would be ideal for lifting for hand-rearing.
Meanwhile, the first brood had been taken at about eight days. They
responded to the touch of a spatula at once, and were very satisfactorily
reared on Frank Meaden's Avivite 248 rearing food. At about three
weeks I interspersed the 248 with a Japanese hulled millet sold in Japan
for hand-rearing Java Sparrows, Budgerigars, Lovebirds, etc. (most pet
birds are sold in the nestling stage in Japan). These little balls seemed to
fascinate the young Saffrons and enabled a very efficient and easy wean-
ing onto regular seed. The 248 was very satisfactory, there being no stress
marks in the feathers as can sometimes be seen in the tail and wing flights
of hand-reared birds that suffer a 'hiccup' in their rearing from parent/
natural to hand-reared.
I have passed the parents on to Peter.Olney, Curator of Birds at Lon-
don Zoo, and have every hope that they will breed in the more appro-
priate environment of a big aviary at the Zoo with only a few Glossy
Starlings, etc. to bully about! I have kept a hand-reared female and in-
tend to run her this year with a male that Desmond Williams is holding
for just this purpose.
The enclosure my Saffrons bred in is a planted flight, almost 30 ft
(9.14 m) long, in an L-shape across the foot and up one side of my tiny
Victoria! terrace garden in the heart of London. I gave a few mealworms
each day. These were snapped up by a pair of Black-faced Grassquits and

a pair of Painted Buntings, I think the Saffrons took a few, but never
showed much Interest, All the usual seeds were available but soft foods,
rearing foods, etc., all seemed to be totally ignored. I believe the nestlings
were reared to their 'natura?' eight days very largely on seed and planted-
flight gatherings.
My conclusions about Saffron Finches are that it is a much more bel-
ligerent-when-breeding species than I had estimated. During a visit to
Australia this year, I learned that SJ,pelzelni is firmly established as a
breeding bird in many Australian collections. It breeds as freely there as
does the domestic canary. Reports from Australian breeders of the
species fully confirmed my own experience detailed above, although
never in such strong detail.
In behaviour I find the Saffron Finch to be noticeably different from
other Sicaiis I have kept, being much more like a typical cowbird or
graeWe. However, Charles Sibley's work on egg white protein analysis
indicates that the Saffron Finch is, in fact, a tanager. It Is a very bold and
attractive bird for a dull, dark and drab garden. There is no doubt it
could easily be established as a self-perpetuating breeding species in
British aviculture - the small ads. in Cage and Aviary Birds for TB. Giant
Saffron Finches' add their testimony to this belief,

The highlight of 1985 was the hatching and hand-rearing of a
female Andean Condor Vultur gryphus. In 1986 this success was con-
solidated by the hand-rearing of two more Condors, both females. The
first egg laid was once again smashed by the male but we managed to
remove the second and third eggs for artificial incubation. The last
egg removed was replaced by a wooden dummy egg and both parents
sat this for the full incubation period. Although we must as always
'play it by ear', this gives us more confidence in perhaps allowing the
parents another attempt at natural incubation and rearing. The Bateleur
Eagles Terathopius ecaudatus and Wedge-tailed Eagles Aquila audax
both built nests. Copulation was frequently observed between the Bate-
leurs but so far this has failed to signal egg-laying.
The Great Eagle Owls Bubo bubo reared two young and likewise the
Snowy Owls Nyctea scandiaca. In both species the pairs that reared two
young last year did the same this year. The second and more recently
established pair of Snowy Owls made their first nesting attempt. The
female Snowy Owl, received from Rotterdam in 1984 and paired with
the five-year old Edinburgh male, laid a single egg which it then pro-
ceeded to ignore. The young female Great Eagle Owl hatched at Chester
Zoo in late May 1985 laid its first egg at onlylO months old. Not sur-
prisingly this very early breeding attempt was unsuccessful - perhaps
just as well as it remained with its brother. We had not expected any
breeding attempt so young but must now exchange one of these siblings
for an unrelated partner or dispose of both of them.
The African Spotted Eagle Owl Bubo africanus originally obtained
from London Zoo in 1960 died after 26 years in the Zoo. This period
of residence is unlikely to be equalled by the resident only lady of the
owls, the female Vermiculated Fishing Owl Scotopelia bouvieri. She
was presented to the Zoo in 1969 having, I am told, flown onto a boat
off the coast of West Africa. Repeated attempts to find her a mate met
with no success and now, showing signs of senility, it looks extremely
unlikely that she will be paired.
Two pairs of Barn Owls Tyto alba reared a total of nine chicks
over the summer. Eight of these young were given to Dr. Carole Hack-
ney who for a number of years has been co-ordinating the release of
these birds in Cheshire. These eight birds were released into the wild as

was the ninth chick. This latter bird was paired with one bred by Mal-
colm Ingham at Thurstaston and the two released together on the
Wirral. We hope that this co-ordinated breeding and release scheme may
be successful in establishing more pairs of this beautiful owl in
Cheshire. All birds were rung with British Trust for Ornithology rings
before release so that their subsequent fates may be followed.
The most exotic of our owls are the Spectacled Owls Pulsatrix
perspicillata. In 1984 we were thrilled when for the first time at Chester
Zoo a young bird was reared by the pair that had previously been
considered to be two females. Last year this pair deserted their eggs
and a single chick, hatched in the incubator, died within hours of being
helped from the egg. This year the 1984 Chester-bred male Spectacled
Owl was paired with an older female and these hatched and reared a
fine chick. This success was rather soured by the death of that chick's
grandmother in September - returning us to the cliff-edge situation of
again having only a single breeding female.
The Lesser Vasa Parrots Coracopsis nigra nigra , which reared two
young in 1985, went through all the motions of courtship and mating,
and one pair even laid, but no chicks were reared. Although we believe
that our previous success may have been related to social stimulation
within the original group of six birds, we suspect that the balance has
now changed; either because of a second pair entering breeding condi-
tion or because of leaving last year's two young in the colony. One of
the adult females had to be removed from the colony because of being
harassed by other birds. This bird has now been re-integrated into the
group and the two 1985 young removed. If this re-establishment of the
original group composition fails then we may have to house the breed-
ing pair separately.
The Blue-eyed Cockatoos Cacatua ophthalmica foiled our attempts
to remove their first clutch of eggs. These disappeared before we could
take them. The second clutch was removed and one chick was hatched
and hand-reared. The third clutch was left to the parents but sadly no
chicks were hatched by them. In 1984 the Yellow-billed Amazons
Amazona collaria, on loan from a private aviculturist, hatched but
failed to rear a single chick and this was repeated in their two clutches
of 1985. It was resolved, therefore,to remove the eggs for incubation
and hand-rearing in 1986. This resulted in two chicks being successfully
reared from their first clutch at Chester Zoo. The Lilacine Amazons
A. autumnalis lilacina have still,after four years at the Zoo, shown no
interest in their nesting boxes nor any signs of social interaction. We
suspect that this may result from wild-caught parents taking a longer
time to settle when brought into captivity.

Parent-reared psittacines included a female Red-sided Eclectus Parrot
Eclectus roratus , 10 Maroon-tailed Conures Pyrrhura melanura - in two
broods from one pair - and 11 Patagonian Conures Cyanoliseus patagonus
The Patagonian Conures are kept in a colony system and the offspring
were from four different pairs. Given that these Conures are not colour-
rung, it is not easy to monitor all aspects of their behaviour. However,
their keeper noted that whilst only two birds were seen to enter the
nest-box, the fledged young appear to be fed by many members of the
colony. Could co-operative breeding be a feature of the social organisa-
tion in wild Patagonian Conures? It is interesting to note that the first
recorded observation of 'helpers at the nest', that is birds other than
parents feeding young, in Spreo Starlings Spreo superbus was reported by
Alfred Ezra in the Avicultural Magazine of 1924 following his obser-
vations on captive birds. Some 50 years later this was documented
in the wild by Tom Huels who studied the social behaviour and breeding
biology of this species in Kenya. Perversely we have not observed first-
brood Spreos attempting to feed second-brood young in the nest. Indeed,
one worry has been that our lack of consistency in rearing these birds
may be related to young from early broods still demanding food from
their parents when these are provisioning later nests. More research is
needed on this topic.
A recurrent problem with breeding Starlings and Corvids in captivity
is the susceptibility, particularly of young birds, to Gapeworm Syngamus
trachea. This parasite is common in wild birds especially Starlings (over
30% of adult and 55% of nestling wild Common Starlings Sturnus vul-
garis are infected). Infection can occur directly from Gapeworm eggs
(either from the faeces of infected birds in the aviary or from those of
wild birds) or indirectly by the birds consuming earthworms or other
invertebrates which act as secondary hosts. Despite regular disinfection
of the aviaries and worming of the adult birds, we have only partly
controlled the problem. Young birds whilst still in the nest have been
treated by presenting the worming agent (we use Panacur) injected
into mealworms. The parents carry these to the young but this method
cannot guarantee that all young receive the correct dosage. Where possible
it is preferable to treat the nestlings direct, removing these from the nest
for oral administration of the drug.
This year we were more successful in rearing tropical starlings and
mynahs in indoor aviaries (where Syngamus can be more effectively
controlled and reinfection is much less likely) than in outdoor enclo-
sures. Rothschild's Mynahs Leucopsar rothschildi were reared by two
different pairs. In both pairs the female parents were obtained through
a dealer from Belgium and it is believed that they were themselves hand-
reared. This does not appear to have affected their ability to rear their

own young.
Long-tailed Glossy Starlings Lamprotomis caudatus and Purple
Glossy Starlings L. purpureus reared young in the large free flight area
of the Tropical House. Other species successfully rearing chicks in the
free flight of the Tropical House included Red-cowled Cardinals Paroria
dominicana, Red-backed Mousebirds Colius castanotus and Java Spar-
rows Padda oryzivora. The Fairy Bluebirds Irena puella nested and
hatched a chick in a very public area of the Tropical House. Both the
female parent and the chick disappeared before the latter fledged. The
Blue-grey Tanagers Thraupis episcopus nested inside one of the Oro-
pendola Psarocolius wagleri nests hanging from the palm trees and
successfully fledged a single chick. However, this chick emerged from
the nest very early and sadly failed to survive to independence.
Our experiences with Fire-tufted Barbets Psilopogon pyrolophus
and Crimson-rumped Toucanets Aulacorhynchus haematopygus indi-
cate constant observation must be maintained on the breeding pairs as
aggression between them is not uncommon. Ideally two aviaries are
needed for each breeding pair to permit separation of male and female
when necessary. This year the Toucanets reared a chick from the first
clutch with no problems. This was removed after fledging, allowing the
parents to start a second clutch from which two chicks hatched. Shortly
after these hatched the female was found dead, circumstances indicating
that she may have been killed by the&amp;apos; previously unproblematical male.
This male then reared the two chicks unaided. Similarly after we sud-
denly lost our breeding female Fire-tufted Barbet the male continued to
rear the chicks unaided. Without knowledge of the social organisation
and reproductive behaviour of these species in the wild, it is difficult
to decide whether this aggression between the pair is normal or aberrant.
Whatever it may be, it is clear that the breeding of these species requires
far more in terms of observation and careful husbandry than many
other birds.
Kookaburras, kingfishers, rollers, hoopoes, motmots, bee-eaters and
hornbills are all included in the order Coraciformes. All are exciting
birds in terms of colour, size, ornamentation or behaviour and as such
are very popular zoo birds. We recently obtained two captive-bred Blue-
crowned Motmots Momotus momota from Kilverstone and these have
now established themselves in the free flight of the Tropical House.
Also two Wrinkled Hornbills Acer os corrugatus are new to the collec-
tion, having been placed at Chester on deposit by H.M. Customs and
Excise. Hornbills are now well represented at Chester. The female Great
Indian Hornbill Buceros bicornis, which laid for the first time in 1985,
is now without a mate but we hold pairs of Grey Hornbill Tockus nasu-
tus , Red-billed Hornbill T. erythrorhynchus and Trumpeter Hornbill

Bycanistes buccinator. The Grey HornbiUs and the Red-billed Hornbills
both showed great interest in breeding, going as far as to start mudding
around the entrances of their nest-boxes.
The Kookaburras Dacelo novaeguineae were exceptionally prolific
this year with one pair rearing two broods each of three chicks and a
second pair rearing a single brood, also of three young. Although the first
of these pairs reared chicks last year, when incidentally both parents were
only two years old, this was the first successful breeding attempt for the
second and older pair which were received as juveniles from Taronga Zoo
in February 1981.
The breeding pairs of Crowned Plovers Vanellus coronatus and Black-
smith's Plovers V. armatus repeated last year's performances in laying
multiple clutches of eggs over the year. Early clutches were removed for
artificial incubation and rearing and later ones left for the parent Plovers
to hatch and rear. Eight Crowned Plovers and seven Blacksmith's Plovers
were reared to independence. However, we have still been unable to estab-
lish second pairs of either species.
Sacred Ibis Threskiomis aethiopica, Straw-necked Ibis Threskiomis
spinicollis. Little Egret Egretta garzetta and Night Herons Nycticorax
nycticorax all nested. However, although both species of ibis hatched
chicks this year, only the Night Herons were successful in rearing their
young. The young Night Heron reared this year has recently been sent,
along with our group of Straw-necked Ibis, to Thrigby Hall Wildlife
Gardens. These moves were necessary in order to accommodate the en-
dangered Waldrapp Ibis Geronticus eremita which have recently been
received at Chester.
Our Humboldt's Penguins Pheniscus humboldti , although quite prolific
in terms of egg-laying have not been very successful in rearing their own
young. In 1985 only one chick was reared and so we decided to either
remove eggs shortly before they hatched or remove recently hatched
chicks for hand-rearing. The first clutch of two eggs was removed a few
days before hatching. One chick was hatched in the incubator but the
other failed to hatch. Subsequently all eggs were left to hatch under the
parents and then the chicks removed for hand-rearing. The first clutch
of two eggs was removed a few days before hatching. One chick was
hatched in the incubator but the other failed to hatch. Subsequently all
eggs were left to hatch under the parents then the chicks removed after
hatching. A total of 17 chicks was hatched of which 16 were reared to
independence. Two of these later died but we consider that 14 surviving
young more than justifies the extra time and work involved in hand-
rearing.
Although we may never repeat the remarkable rearing of 11 Ostriches
Struthio camelus in that dry, hot summer of 1984, we were pleased to

rear two strong chicks to independence. Both are now at Haigh Hall Coun-
try Park, Wigan, from where we were grateful to receive five Emu Dro-
maius novaehollandiae eggs. Two of these eggs hatched at Chester and
both chicks were successfully reared.
Two Rheas Rhea americana and a dozen Chilean Tinamous Nothoproc-
ta perdicaria were also bred.
The artificial incubation and rearing of a Saras Crane Grus antigone was,
we believe, a first at Chester. The two male Red-crowned Cranes Grus
japonensis received from Rotterdam Zoo in 1984 still await mates. The
Demoiselle Crane Anthropoides virgo has now been paired and the West
African Crowned Cranes Balearica pavonina appear well settled in their
new enclosure.
A pair of White-eared Pheasants Crossoptilon crossoptilon belonging to
Jersey Zoo had been held at Chester since 1980 but over the years 1981 to
1985 only infertile eggs were produced. Last year we were able to exchange
males with Jersey and this year for the first time had fertile eggs from
which three chicks hatched and one was reared. That bird, a strong young
male, is expected to be sent to Antwerp Zoo in the spring. Three Grey
Peacock Pheasants Polyplectron hicalcaratum were reared but our only
remaining female Palawan Peacock Pheasant Polyplectron emphanum,
hatched at Chester in 1984, may still not be old enough to breed.
The Black Swans Cygnus atratus had another good year and two of
the six cygnets reared have been given to Paignton Zoo. From this pair,
received from the Wildfowl Trust at Slimbridge in 1978, a total of 26
young Black Swans have been reared and sent to other collections. The
newly-acquired Hawaiian Geese Branta sandvicensis and Red-breasted
Geese B. ruficollis both laid for the first time this year. The Hawaiian
Geese were left to sit their own eggs but failed to hatch any young. The
Red-breasted Goose eggs were removed for artificial incubation and four
goslings reared. Other waterfowl reared included four Fulvous Tree Ducks
Dendrocygna bicolor, six Laysan Teal Anas platyrhynchos laysanensis,
three Chiloe Wigeon Anas sibilatrix, five Carolina Ducks Aix sponsa and

exceeded both last year's figures and our expectations and reflected the
hard work once again put in by our Bird Keeping Staff and the members
of the Animal Breeding Centre.

Part II of this series (Brickell, 1987) related to data on the Cape
Canary Serinus canicollis , Black-eared Canary S.mennelli and Streaky-
headed Canary S. gularis.
The Black-throated Canary S. atrogularis is also known as the Peach
Canary, Yellow-rumped Seedeater and Yellow-rumped Serin. During the
breeding season it constructs a compact cup of dry grass and fine twigs
bound with cobwebs. The lining may consist of plant down, cotton, ani-
mal hair, wool and feathers. The nest is situated at 1.2-1.5m above
ground in a vertical fork of a tree, often in conifers, in dry cones of pro-
tea bushes, at the base of palm fronds or in a notch of a tree trunk. There
is also a record of it nesting on the rafter of an outbuilding.
It breeds in all months in the Transvaal Province of South Africa and
from November to January in Zimbabwe. Two to four eggs are laid. They
are white or pale bluish green, plain or sparingly spotted with brown,
purple and black, chiefly at the large end. Egg measurements average (22)
16.7 x 12.4 (15.5-18 x 11.4-13.2). Incubation is by the female, and lasts
12-13 days. The nestling period is 15-18 days and the young are fed by
both parents, but the male plays a greater part for some considerable
time. The young are independent at 6-7 weeks.
The Yellow-eyed Canary S. mozambicus is more commonly known
outside Africa as the Green Singing Finch, Yellow-fronted Canary, Icter-
ine Canary and Mozambique Serin. When nesting, it builds a shallow
compact cup of fine twigs and other vegetation, bound with cobwebs.
The lining may consist of seeding grass heads, plant fibres, animal hair
and the occasional feather. Nests are usually built in horizontal forks of
trees, bushes or creepers at 1-6 m above ground.
It breeds from October to April in the Transvaal Province of South
Africa, and from September to May in Zimbabwe. Two to four eggs are
laid and are white or pale blue, plain or sparsely spotted with pink,
reddish brown and black, chiefly at the large end. Egg measurements
average (86) 16.3 x 12.1 (14.6-18.5 x 11.1-13.8). Incubation is by the
female alone and takes 13-14 days; the nestling period is 16-25 days. The
male feeds the fledglings for some time afterwards but they are indepen-

dent at 9-10 weeks.
The Black-headed Canary S. alario alario , from North and Central
Cape Province, is also known as the Mountain Canary, Alario Finch
and Blackhead. The subspecies S.a. leucolaema , from Namibia, Bot-
swana and West Cape Province, is known as the Damara Black-headed
Canary and King Black-headed Canary.
At the start of the breeding season (July to April in South Africa), it
constructs a deep cup nest of dry grass and fine twigs with a lining of
wool or similar soft material. The nest may be situated 30-100 cm above
the ground in a bush or small tree. Two to four eggs are laid which are
white or bluish green, blotched and streaked with brown, chiefly at the
large end. Egg measurements average (38) 16.5 x 12.4 (15-18.2 x 11.5-
13.3). Incubation is by the female and lasts for 13-14 days; nestling
period is 20-22 days.
The Black-throated Canary feeds on grass and weed seeds, buds, berries
and insects. It has been recorded feeding on the seeds of:

BIRDS OF PREY AT TIERPARK BERLIN, DDR
By ALAN PRINGLE (Cobham)

Since the division of Berlin in 1961 two very different zoological
collections have grown and developed in the respective halves of the city.
While the older, original Zoological Garden, founded in 1841 in what is
now West Berlin, has built up one of the finest collections of animals in
the world (including an impressive display of birds), the younger and larger
Tierpark in East Berlin, founded 1954, has tended toward more specialised
groups, namely ungulates, waterfowl and birds of prey.
During a short visit in May of this year, I was fortunate enough to be
shown around the Tierpark by Dr. Dieter Minneman, Curator of Birds of
Prey and Owls. As the bulk of their collection is not on show to the
public, his hospitality and help was invaluable.
The Tierpark is vast, over 300 acres, and the raptor collection has
spread throughout the grounds as it has developed. Most of the on-show
aviaries are small, basic affairs with the exception of a huge mixed species
exhibit built on to the back of the Alfred Brehm House for cats and birds.
This aviary, measuring approximately 140 ft long, 60 ft deep and 30 feet
high (42.67m x 18.28 x 9.14 m), houses over 15 species of diurnal raptor.
The back and one side of the aviary interior simulates a sheer cliff face
overlooking a rough terrain of small trees, stumps, bushes and small ponds.
Red Kites Milvus milvus and Black Kites M. migrans wheeled and circled
over less energetic groups of King Vulture Sarcoramphus papa and Ameri-
can Black Vulture Coragyps atratus.
Old World Vultures, however, were the most numerous inhabitants of
this aviary and included well-known species such as Loppet-faced Torgos
tracheliotus, Egyptian Neophron percnopterus and no less than five species
of Griffon Vulture (Gyps fulvus, G. indicus, G. rueppelii, G. himalayensis
and G. coprotheres)\ Numerous crevices and ledges had encouraged many
species to breed. Risk of inter-specific nest predation has been reduced by
removing the eggs for artificial incubation only to be returned to the
parents at the pipping stage (the adults having meanwhile innocently
incubated wooden eggs!).
Elsewhere in the Tierpark one could see the famous breeding pair of
Harpy Eagles Harpia harpyja who produced the world's first captive-bred
chick in 1981. Other successful 'world firsts' of which the Tierpark is
justifiably proud include European Black Vulture Aegypius monachus and
Wedge-tailed Eagle Aquila audax. Their Secretary Birds Sagittarius serpent-
arius bred for the first time in 1983 but Vogelpark Walsrode had claimed

the honour two years earlier.
Small owl aviaries around the Tierpark display an interesting selection
to the public including Spectacled Owls Pulsatrix perspicillata , Boobooks
Ninox novaeseelandiae and Tengmalm's Owls Aegolius funereus. As with
diurnal raptors, however, the main owl collection was off-show, and
included Oriental Bay Owls Phodilus hadius, Ferruginous Pygmy Owls
Glaucidium brasilianum, Great Grey Owls Strix nebulosa and Burrowing
Owls Speotyto cunicularia. Some young Milky Eagle Owls Bubo lacteus
were temporarily occupying one aviary in a new private block which will
eventually house the Tierpark's Sea Eagle collection. These are something
of a speciality within a speciality and include several breeding pairs of
White-tailed Sea Eagles Haliaeetus albicilla , White-bellied Sea Eagle H. leu-
cogaster, Pallas's Sea Eagle H. leucoryphus and African Fish Eagle H
vocifer. Scientists from the Tierpark are currently in Madagascar studying
the highly endangered Madagascar Sea Eagle H. vociferoides in the wild
and assessing the feasibility of bringing some into captivity. At another
off-show area, the two most famous Sea Eagles could be seen, the Bald
Eagle H. leucocephalus and the mighty Steller's Sea Eagle H. pelagicus.
The latter are quite magnificent birds of huge, solid stature with striking
black and white plumage and the largest beak of any bird of prey. Sizewise
these are regarded as the largest raptor although female Harpy Eagles are
heavier. Until recently the Tierpark had only two Steller's Sea Eagles,
both males, but their continued courtship and nesting activity prompted
the staff to try them with a Wedge-tailed Eagle egg out of curiosity. To
everyone's astonishment the 'pair' hatched and reared the young Wedge-
tailed Eagle! Now, fortunately, a young female has been acquired so
hopefully it will not be long before another 'first' is achieved. An interest-
ing observation made here on the Sea Eagles is the absence of cainism
(where the eldest chick killes its younger, weaker brethren) in the species
from temperate climates while it is a common phenomenon in those from
more tropical areas. As one would expect, cainism in areas of difficult
fishing and limited supply, it seems odd that it occurs only in those species
which hunt the rich, well-stocked rivers and mangrove swamps of Africa
and Southeast Asia.
Modern technology plays a big role in raptor production at the Tier-
park as Dr. Minnemann showed us when we reached the main operation's
laboratory in the Park. Here closed-circuit television cameras record birds
on the nest and microphones listen in on hatching chicks. Electronic eggs
are used to measure the fluctuating temperatures in the nests under brood-
ing birds. Many research students work on their thesis projects at the

Tierpark and during our visit one girl was studying a nest-ing pair of
Turkey Vultures Cathartes aura. Birds already being returned to the wild
from the Tierpark include Barn Owls Tyto alba. Tawny Owls Strix aluco,
White-tailed Sea Eagles Haliaeetus albicilla and several Ospreys Pandion
haliatus, the latter mostly being accident victims which are brought to the
parks for treatment and eventual release.
Few falcons appeared to be kept at the park but smaller birds of prey
are still well represented and include Red-thighed Falconets Microhierax
caerulescem , White-eyed Buzzards Butastur teesa , Long-legged Buzzards
Buteo rufinus and Red-tailed Hawks B. jamaicensis. By far the best repre-
sented group, however, is the eagle collection with such rarities on show as
Ornate Hawk Eagles Spizaetus omatus, Imperial Eagles Aquila heliaca,
Wahlberg's Eagle A. wahlbergi and a solitary Martial Eagle Polemaetus
bellicosus for which Dr. Minnemann hopes to find a mate as soon as
possible. Grey Eagle Buzzards Geranoaetus melanoleucus, a rarely seen
species from South America and a large breeding group of Striated Cara-
caras Phalcoboenus australis completed the highlights.
Common Buzzards Buteo buteo and Tawny Eagles Aquila rapax are
often used to great success as foster parents to other birds' eggs. This often
ensures safe hatching of rarer species under tried and trusted older birds
while the true parents are free to lay again, make their mistakes and gain
their experience with a second, or even third clutch.
In total over 70 diurnal raptor species and 35 owl species are kept at
the Tierpark of which 50% are breeding. Dr. Minnemann aims to breed at
least one new species each year and so far, over the past 20 years or so, he
has maintained that ambition. He attributes his success to simple, yet vital
factors such as proper pairing through observation by vigilant staff, feeding
of only freshly killed feed animals which, in turn, have been fed only fresh
grass in the week before they are fed to the birds, and seclusion during the
breeding season. He stressed the importance of inter-collection co-opera-
tion and could not impress upon me enough his willingness to exchange
stock with anyone who cares to contact him.
In short, Tierpark Berlin must have one of, if not the best bird of prey
collections in the world and anyone interested in the captive maintenance
of these birds is well advised to visit it. The staff are very helpful and
friendly and, provided advance warning is given, only too happy to show
people around 'behind the scenes', which is where the real collection is.

A FLEETING GLIMPSE AT BIRDKEEPING IN MALTA

During seven days on the main Maltese island, 28th December 1986
to 4th January 1987, I visited three shops that sell cage birds, the home
of one fancier, and read about finch-trapping in the excellent ornitholo-
gical book A New Guide to the Birds of Malta by Joe Sultana and Charles
Gaud, published by the Malta Ornithological Society. What follows is
not only uncomprehensive, it is probably unrepresentative to the point
of being fragmentary. Anyway what follows is at least factual!
The most interesting shop was in Hamrun and it was the only one to
sell only birds. The man there was a trapper as well as a seller of birds.
Some birds were wild-caught by him in Malta (e.g. the Chaffinches Frin-
gilla coelebs), but the two unidentified tropical starlings (Sturnidae)
were no doubt wild-caught abroad and then imported. The Budgerigars
Melopsittacus undulatus, Zebra Finches Poephila guttata and Canaries
Serinus canaria all displayed the individual variety of plumage associated
with domestication, while the Java Sparrows Padda oryzivora and one
Pekin Robin Leiothrix lutea were most likely also born in an aviary.
In Malta all wild birds are protected by law except that 21 species or
groups may be shot and 15 trapped and sold. Of these last the shop in
Hamrun was offering for sale Hawfinch Coccothraustes coccothraustes ,
Goldfinch Carduelis carduelis, Greenfinch C chloris , Chaffinch, Siskin
C spinus , Serin Serinus serinus , Linnet Carduelis cannahina, Song Thrush
Turdus philomelos and Quad Coturnix coturnix (the last is a delicacy,
the rest are cage birds, of course). In addition, the following species were
on offer apparently against the law: Brambling Fringilla montifringilla ,
Hedge Sparrow Prunella modularis , Short-toed Lark Calandrella brachy-
dactyla and European Robin Erithacus rubecula.
The numbers of each species held in the shop on 30th December 1986

It will be seen that 59.0% of the individuals for sale are foreign cage
birds, nearly half of them Canaries. The balance, 41.0%, is of European
birds, all apparently caught wild on the island. Of these over half are
Chaffinches.
As regards price, the Canaries vary according to the breed, from
#M2.50 to #M5.50. Budgerigars are inexpensive at 75 cents each. The
Hawfinch is costly at #M 15.00 because it is an uncertain migrant, whereas
the regular Chaffinch is only #M2.00. Robins are less popular than
finches, perhaps because they are softbills and thus more difficult to
feed, and sell for 75 cents apiece.
Some of the birds were kept in distressingly small cages. A Chaf-
finch, itself 15 cm long, or a Greenfinch, 14.5 cm long, may be kept
in a cage only 18 cm long, 12.5 cm wide and 11.7 cm high; a Robin,
14 cm long, in a cage 20.00 cm x 12.5 cm x 14.3 cm, and a Hawfinch,
17.5 cm long, in a cage 19.3 cm x 13.0 cm x 13.0 cm. None of these
birds could easily or fully stretch their wings.
The only public display of birds I came across was in St. Anton Bot-
anical Gardens, at Balzon. This was limited to the following in large
aviaries: 2 Crowned Cranes Balearica pavonina (the grey-necked species),

GROSBEAK STARLINGS
Scissirostrum dubium
By ERIC CLEWLOW
(Natal, Republic of South Africa)

In 1985 I imported a shipment of birds from Belgium and among them
were four starlings which according to the supplier were Aplonis mysolensis.
With no illustrated reference to confirm this, these birds were described
locally as Moluccan Starlings (Walters, Birds of the World). The four birds
were left together and on two occasions eggs were found in the nest-box
they had decided upon. Two eggs, light blue and speckled, were laid on
each occasion.
When I received Vol. 91, No. 3, of the Avicultural Magazine and saw
the article and photograph relating to the breeding of Grosbeak Starlings
by Bryan Peck I immediately saw that my 'Moluccan Starlings' were
Scissitorstrum dubium and upon reference again to Walters, found them
described as Scissorbill Starling. However, the important point is that the
birds had been moved from my large garden away into a breeding aviary
2 m high, 1 m wide and 4 m long. The birds were quite happy but very
shy. Upon entering the aviary the four birds would immediately enter a
nest or two. After a few months I decided to move them back to the large
planted aviary where it was more convenient for me to watch them. When
I did this I also put back into the large aviary, the nest-box which they
appeared to favour most whilst in the smaller aviary. This was nothing
more than a budgerigar nest-box with the loose concave panel removed.
Like Mr. Peck, I left the nest alone and did not attempt to start the
nest or supply any particular material. Being in the large planted aviary,
they had a choice of the normal grasses supplied and, of course, could
find loose feathers, etc., lying around. The nest built was very sparse and

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998595024390244" page_id="56240564"  page_num="110" year="" vol="">
coarse wide grass was used with very few feathers but, as with Mr. Peck's
birds, the nest was a loose affair with not the faintest hint of a cup. Two
eggs were duly laid and around the nest-box was declared a 'No-Go' area!
On 15th December 1986 I could resist the temptation no longer and upon
looking into the nest-box, two beautiful chicks were observed. This was
the first and last time that the nest-box was approached directly and the
two young left the nest on 18th January 1987. They were duller and
smaller editions of the parent birds. One of the young was very strong on
the wing compared to the other. The weakest spent a day or two at low
altitude but the parents were most attentive and were always close by.
The diet which is supplied to all the softbills generally consists of:
soaked dog biscuit, assorted fruits, a rearing food mixed with hard-boiled
egg, carrot, Brewers Yeast and CLO. The basic rearing food is one manu-
factured and supplied by Kameeldrift Bird Farm in Pretoria. As there are a
number of seedeaters in the aviary as well, I also supply a dish of soaked
seed daily. Live food initially was restricted to live ants and the occasional
mealworms. As I noticed that the starlings appeared to get left behind
when the mealworms were supplied, I became rather worried and on one
occasion my son and two granddaughters spent the morning looking for
garden insects to keep them going. However, when these were put in the
aviary, the Chorister Robin, Cape Robin and Amethyst Starlings got in
first and that was that. Sitting at the breakfast table one morning our
servant came to me with a packet she said she had found in our spare deep
freeze. With a quizzical look I gazed into the packet only to see a quantity
of 'flying ants' which, having been caught by my family earlier in the year,
I had separated into smaller plastic bags and put into the deep freeze for
a rainy day! Well, the rainy day had arrived and I needed some additional
food for the Starlings badly. I had never used deep frozen flying ants
before so, taking a small quantity (30/40), I left them to thaw out. After
about three-quarters of an hour I entered the big aviary with the flying
ants on a piece of paper in the palm of my hand. Before I could place
them in the dog biscuit dish, a hen Black Sunbird helped herself to one!
At this stage I could see that the Starlings had noticed what I was holding
and immediately I put the flying ants in the dish, they also came down and
I am pleased to say that they ate most of them and then the parents flew
to the nest-box and proceeded to feed the young. This was a daily happen-
ing when the flying ants were provided. I am pleased to say that my stock
of frozen ants lasted until 28th January and I have now gone back to a
few mealworms daily.
Both young birds are extremely well and active and it would appear
that the parents are getting ready to go to nest again.

What is the world's most abundant bird species? The combined popula-

the distinction probably goes to one of the petrels or shearwaters of the
southern seas. Estimated world population for the Sooty Shearwater is
given as a thousand million, making it the likeliest contender.

The Oriental Crested Ibis is the subject of a special project by the
Brehm Fund for International Bird Conservation. The project aims to
provide equipment for research and will bring three Chinese biologists to
Germany in 1987 for a training programme in research, conservation and

The total world population of this ibis is thought to be 34, of which
29 make up the wild populations in China and the USSR. The five in
captivity are in two collections in China and Japan.
Seven young were reared in three active nest sites in Shaanxi Province

The breeding of colour mutations is not really something that appeals
to me but occasionally the odd one turns up in wild birds and causes
interest. Certain finches and psittacines are noted for mutations but, as
far as I am aware, kingfishers have until now lacked reports.
Early in 1987 an albino Kookaburra was found in Australia by a
passing motorist. The bird, weak and very hungry, was taken to Heals-
ville Sanctuary in Victoria where it has regained its strength. 'Albi', as he
was christened, is believed to be three to four months old.

BIRDS OF NEW GUINEA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99857658974359" page_id="56240568"  page_num="114" year="" vol="">
By Bruce M. Beehler, Thane K. Pratt and Dale A. Zimmerman. Princeton
University. Hardback - ISBN 0-691-08385-1, Price #53 (including postage
from Messrs. Wheldon and Wesley); paperback ISBN 0-691-02394-8, #25.20
This book is the first definitive ornithological field guide to New
Guinea and will be very well received by all aviculturists whether they are
seriously interested in the birds of the region, or merely anxious to fill a
gap in the bookshelf. It is the result of an elaborate cooperative project
involving experts in Papuan birds in Australia, New Jersey, Los Angeles,
New York, New Mexico and New Guinea itself. The three main authors
write in the acknowledgements that in a few years the book will require
revision because of the continuing discoveries of colleagues working in the
field and studying in museums and universities. However there is no doubt
that this first edition is a standard work of reference that will be extremely
useful for a long time to come.
The first 40 or so pages describe the geography and natural history of
New Guinea and its satellite islands. It covers ornithological exploration,
ornithogeography and the bird regions of the land for there are some 15
regions of varying size, most of which form distinct zoogeographic units
well defined by the presence of endemic bird populations. The section on
ecology is particularly interesting, although I must admit to finding the
entire part on the natural history totally absorbing.
There is a most helpful chapter entitled 'In the Field', which gives in-
formation essential to anyone intending to visit New Guinea for ornitho-
logical reasons; from the most suitable binoculars and other equipment,
health hazards, permits and etiquette to observe, all the way to suggestions
on where and how to look for birds.
New Guinea is the second largest island in the world, a lush biologi-
cally-rich land supporting a wide radiation of plant life that in turn sup-
ports over 700 species of birds.
It is one of the riches parts of the world in numbers of species, with a
typical square kilometre of lowland rainforest supporting around 150
species. In richer areas the list may increase to 165 or 170 resident species.
This is poor compared to some parts of the Amazon where up to 350
species may be found, but New Guinea is unusual in supporting large
numbers of fruit and nectar-eating birds. Compared to a similar forest
community in Peru, New Guinea has twice as many fruit-eaters and
nectar-eaters as a proportion of the fauna.
The main text of the book follows normal field guide format, with an
introduction for each family then an account of each species listed.

Terminology is a mixture of English (Australian) and American, but I
found no cause for complaint nor any personal confusion. The English
name is clear and when there are widely used alternatives, these are
also given. For example: BARN SWALLOW Hirundo rustica (Swallow,
Common or European Swallow). Paragraphs under the headings Des-
cription, Similar Species, Habits, Voice and Range cover their subjects
succinctly and helpfully. More than 600 species are illustrated in 47
colour plates and a further eight black and white halftone plates. They
are painted by Dale Zimmerman and James Coe and are well up to the
high standard expected of modern field guides in the Peterson tradition.
My personal delight was to find the plate illustrating the 16 species of
finch, the first time to my knowledge that those species have all appeared
in colour in any publication. Since I am fortunate in owning four of the
species of Lonchura illustrated, I was able to make very critical compari-
sons. My only concern was the eye of the Great-billed or Grand Munia
L. grandis which is shown red - in contrast to the dark brown of the
other species. I have five of this species, two males and three females, all of
which have brown eyes. It is a very small point, and not one that would
result in a mis-identification, nor prevent a warm endorsement for a much-
needed addition to the bird books of the Pacific.

Breeding Fischer's Whydah
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998388076923077" page_id="56240570"  page_num="116" year="" vol="">
Although an account of this first breeding has already been published
in another journal (Foreign Bird Association magazine), David Coles felt
that Avicultural Society members would be interested in the details recor-
ded briefly below.
My pair of Fischer's Whydahs Vidua fischeri were kept in an unplanted,
L-shaped aviary which was 18 ft long (3.65 m).
When the cock came into full colour in June 1984 he started hovering
and darting around the aviary, singing loudly in flight and around the
aviary occupants. The displays, especially towards his mate, increased
intensely over a period of about four weeks. He was observed feeding the
hen whilst still hovering above her for long periods, sometimes for five
minutes or more in the air.
During the third week of August the hen started to visit an unoccupied
Zebra Finch nest-box for anything up to 10 minutes at a time. A week
later the nest-box was examined and found to contain four white Zebra
Finch eggs and two alien eggs, both larger. The two alien eggs were
coloured pale blue with reddish markings in the form of lines, not spots.
I was lucky and the Zebra Finch parents hatched both eggs. The
chicks were larger than Zebra Finch chicks and very dark in colour
(sooty). Unfortunately one chick died at four days old but the other one
flourished with its three Zebra Finch nest-mates. The Whydah chick left
the nest on 19th September, 1984, at approximately 16 days old. It
begged for food just like the Zebra Finch chicks, with its head on one side
and crouching. It was fed for approximately three weeks after leaving the
nest before it was seen feeding itself. The parent Whydahs showed no
interest in nest or chick after laying the two eggs.
When first hatched, the chick had very dark body down. It developed
light fawn colouring underneath, and a darker rusty brown on the back,
head, etc. It moulted out to a very pale cream underneath and much
darker back, with neck to eye having two dark lines appearing giving the
form of stripes. At six months it moulted out into a hen bird in more or
less adult colours.
The young Whydah was transferred with its parents to a smaller finch
aviary for the winter which was easier to protect against bad weather.After
approximately four months in winter quarters, the hen Whydah was again
observed visiting a Budgerigar-type nest-box (which could not be opened),
occupied by a pair of Blue-capped Waxbills. On several occasions the hen
Whydah was observed to wait for the hen Blue-capped Waxbill to leave the
nest-box (but was seen twice with the Blue-capped cock in the nest-box).

I believe the hen Whydah laid her eggs between 17th and 23rd March
(1985) because after this period she was not seen near the Blue-capped
Waxbill nest. On 20th April 1985 two young were observed together with
three Blue-capped Waxbill chicks, being fed by the latter's parents.
This time the young Whydahs did not beg to be fed, as on the previous
occasion with Zebra Finch parents, nor did they crouch or put their heads
to one side, so perhaps chicks' behaviour varies according to their foster
parents. Both young were reared to maturity. They were much darker than
the first young reared (hen) and so perhaps can be sexed before moulting.
They both turned out to be cocks -1 was unsure at first because they were
almost black for nearly six months, then started to show buff marking on
the cap and belly.

Three young Fischer's Whydahs were reared to maturity during the
period August 1984 to April 1985, from two broods, one fostered by
Zebra Finches and one by Blue-capped Waxbills.

The Lemon-breasted Canary
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.768793928571428" page_id="56240571"  page_num="117" year="" vol="">
At last the official version of the Lemon-breasted Canary saga has been
brought to the forefront (Vol. 91, No. 3) and this does indeed clarify the
position leaving no doubt now as to who initially discovered the bird. I
am, however, very distressed to learn that although Messrs. Clancy and
Lawson acknowledged this fact in 1960, the species was not named after
Jack Scheepers - surely an injustice! I would think that it is up to our
national and provincial cage bird and avicultural bodies to take the matter
up and see that Mr. Scheepers' name is justly recorded for all to see. Per-
haps this is something our fellow member, Neville Brickell, should pursue
vigourously?

VISIT TO BIRDWORLD, FARNHAM

<bodyText confidence="0.9915345" page_id="56240572"  page_num="118" year="" vol="">
Members spent a very enjoyable day on 11th April 1987 at Birdworld,
Farnham, by kind invitation of Mr. and Mrs. Roy Harvey. After a very
good lunch provided by our hosts, Mr. Robert Harvey gave a short
talk on the history of Birdworld and then took members on a guided
tour. There was a great deal to see and admire in the beautifully land-
scaped gardens and it is quite remarkable how much this enthusiastic
family enterprise has achieved in so few years.After being revived by wel-
come tea, members made their way home by way of the excellent gift
shops where the merchandise is of a very high standard, great care having
been taken in the choice of stock and the presentation.
We would like to thank our hosts and the entire Harvey family for
giving us such a pleasant and interesting day.
FUTURE EVENTS: Tentative dates have been arranged for the follow-
ing: Lunch and lecture meeting at Warren Hill, Hartley Wintney, on 11th
July; garden party at Chestnut Lodge, Cobham, on 6th September, and a
dinner to be arranged in late October/early November, Further details of
all these events will be inserted in the Magazine if there is time, or sent
individually to members who have asked to be on the meetings mailing list.

species to be crepuscular, nocturnal and terrestrial. Its preferred habitat is
savannah with brush cover (Blake).
Austin states in his studies of wild Thick-knees that the female generally
lays one to three eggs in a nest depression on the ground (plate 1). Pate's
studies and those done at the Dallas Zoo have documented that captive
Thick-knees generally lay one and sometimes two eggs in a nest depres-
sion on the ground (plate 2). The female Thick-knee, in the wild and in
captivity, incubates the egg($) for 26-28 days, hatching precocial, downy
young. Artificially incubated eggs have been incubated from 27-28 days.
These figures were derived from separate data recorded by both Pate and
the Dallas Zoo.
Captive history
At present there are 12 zoos keeping this species that are registered
with ISIS. From 1972 to 1984, nine zoos had recorded breedings of the
Thick-knee. In 1984, only two zoos successfully bred B. bistriatus as
reported to ISIS; they were Pitts, California, with one chick; and the
Dallas Zoo with five chicks.
The Dallas Zoo has exhibited this species since April 1966. From June
1972 to June 1985, there were 11 successful breedings from the two pairs
exhibited. One pair is displayed in the Rainforest exhibit together with
18 other bird species. The other pair is exhibited in an enclosure measuring
12 x 10 x 12 ft (3.66 x 3.05 x 3.66 m) with a piano wire front and three

solid walls with two skylights. Exhibited with this pair are 0.2 Gull-billed
Tern Sterna nilotica and 1.1 Black-necked Stilt Himantopus mexicanus .
The female (identified as A-4) of the pair exhibited in the 'wire cage' has
laid 17 eggs from May 1983 to June 1985. Only the eggs laid by this
female have been artificially incubated.
Four of the first five eggs laid by A-4 were discovered broken. Of the
17, eight eggs were broken and seven artificially incubated. Two were left
under minimal cage disturbance, and from one of these a chick hatched
which was successfully parent-reared. It was decided to remove eggs im-
mediately upon discovery to incubate them artificially. The techniques
used at the Dallas Zoo for hand-rearing the Double-striped Thick-knee will
be discussed in this paper.
Artificial incubation
Of the seven eggs that were removed from the nest of A-4, four chicks
were hatched. Detailed hand-rearing records were kept for all the chicks.
The incubator used for all seven eggs was the Marsh Manufacturing
Roll-X Model RX 2, with automatic turner (plate 3). The turner rotated
the eggs hourly. The dry bulb temperature was kept at 99.5*F (37.5*C)
and the wet bulb temperature was kept between 86*F (30.0*C) and
89*F (31.67*C). The relative humidity was calculated as between 56% and
66 %.
Before incubating, each egg was weighed with an Ottaus Triple Beam
Balance, and the length and width were measured using a dial caliper
(Table 1). Each egg was candled with a Lyon Electric Co., Inc., candler
Serial No. EE, at various stages during incubation to observe development.
After candling, each egg was weighed and the information was recorded
to monitor development. Thirty-six to 24 hours before the estimated
hatching time, the egg was transferred to a disinfected hatcher, set at the
same dry and wet bulb temperature as the incubator. Pate suggests lower-
ing the dry bulb temperature slightly and raising the wet bulb temperature
to ease hatching.
Hand-rearing
After hatching, chicks were weighed and injected with 2.5 mg Spec-
tinomycin (100 mg/ml) near the keel. Betadine solution was applied to
the umbilicus. An identification number was given and registered with
ISIS. Chicks were then transferred to a sterile brooder measuring 19x18
x 13 in (0.48 x 0.46 x 0.33 m), with the initial temperature set at 95*F
(35.0*C). To control brooder temperature, the brooder top was adapted
to accommodate the hood from a Marsh Manufacturing Turn-X Model
TX-6 incubator. The temperature was gradually decreased to slightly

above room temperature within a three-week period, with the lowest
temperature being 80*F (26.7*C). The brooder was cleaned daily with
Rocal-D disinfectant and sprayed with a dilute solution of Nolvasan for
disinfection.
Six to twelve hours after*hatching, food was offered to the chick using
tweezers to induce pecking action necessary for food consumption. By
holding the food slightly above the head of the chick, it could grasp and
consume the food with ease. The fourth hand-reared chick, A-15, would
eat only from a white plate or paper towel. It was suggested that the chick
could not distinguish the food when it was offered on a dull or dark plate.
Each chick was fed a specific hand-rearing diet, four times daily to start
(Table 2). Mealworms were fed, moulted for the first week to ease diges-
tion. By the fourth week, chicks were fed twice daily for a period of one
week. After 35 days, the B. bistriatus juvenile was fed a modified adult
Thick-knee diet (Fig. 2). A nutritional analysis of the hand-rearing diet
was calculated by Mary Allen and David Baer, Zoo Animal Nutritionists
at Michigan State University (Fig. 3).
Daily consumption and growth was recorded during the hand-rearing,
using a standard data form (plate 4). Data headings included species name,
identity number of chick, date, weight of chick, time weighed, quantity of
food eaten, weight of food eaten, time of feedings, and ample space for
observational comments. For a comparison development graph of the four
chicks, see Figure 1.
Complications
The first chick to be hand-reared, A-9, was helped out of its shell and
developed a problem within the first week. The veterinarian examined the
chick the second day and noticed the middle toes on both feet were turn-
ing in. This problem eventually worked itself out as development con-
tinued. The third chick, A-ll, developed a loss in appetite the second day.
On the third day, the veterinarian injected .75 cc Normalsol with 5% dex-
trose (electrolyte solution) subcutaneously near the keel. This induced the
Thick-knee chick to eat a small amount. A second injection was adminis-
tered later the same day. Gatorade was given as the only source of liquid
that day. By the fourth day, chick A-ll was very eagerly consuming food.
Tap water was given to the hand-reared chicks. All four B. bistriatus
chicks developed a white crystalline deposit on their beaks above the nos-
trils, possibly due to overheating. The encrusted beaks were wiped clean
daily with distilled water.
Behaviour
B. bistriatus chicks have several interesting behaviours. One chick was

observed, when startled by a loud noise or sudden movement, to drop
its body instantly as if pulled to the ground. Its entire body was flattened
with legs tucked under and its neck flush with the ground. The keeper
tried once to pick it up from this alarm position and the chick was very
limp, as if it were dead.
Pate discussed a problem of human imprinting with the chicks that
were hand-reared at Chicago Lincoln Park Zoo. Of the four chicks that
were hand-reared at the Dallas Zoo, none exhibited obvious imprinting
upon humans. After 40-45 days, they became very independent and kept
away from the keeper. Perhaps the reason that no imprinting occurred
while hand-rearing the B. bistriatus chicks was the minimal time of human
contact during this period. After the first hand-reared chick, A-9, the other
three were only weighed for up to 39 days, while at Chicago Lincoln Park
Zoo, the chicks were still being pulled for weighing at up to approximately
80 days.
Another behaviour that was particularly interesting was that of the
flight of this species. None of the chicks or adults at the Dallas Zoo have
taken flight, to the best of our knowledge. Blake reports that they are very
swift fliers, but choose to run or walk if possible. Even the adult breeding
pair of Thick-knees in the Rainforest exhibit have never been known to fly.
Conclusion
Being involved in the hand-rearing of the Double-striped Thick-knee
was thoroughly educational as well as enjoyable. There are several varia-
tions to the procedures of hand-rearing this species, but this procedure has
worked the best so far. The Bird Department at the Dallas Zoo is always
searching for new and better techniques to ensure the successful and
healthy hand-rearing of all species.

THE JAVAN OR BLACK-RUMPED MUNIA
Lonchura leucogastroides
By ROBIN L. RESTALL
(London)
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.99833025" page_id="56240592"  page_num="130" year="" vol="">
The sun was shining on the balcony of my first floor hotel room in
Singapore. The plate glass French windows were drawn wide open and I
was inside reading some business papers when my attention was drawn to a
small bird feeding among the plants growing along the window boxes at
the edge of the balcony. I reached for my field glasses and soon identified
the bird as a Black-rumped Munia Lonchura leucogastroides. After watch-
ing it for a while I put down the glasses and slowly walked towards the
bird. Within five minutes I was standing literally within touching distance
and watched the bird I had first seen, and its companion, carefully work
right along the planter eating the green seeds of the trefoil grass that was
rampant among the bouganvillea. It was a most enthralling experience.
How I wished my own Black-rumped Munias at home were as indifferent
to my close proximity, but no doubt being caught and handled several
times deeply impresses upon a bird the untrustworthiness of man.
The Black-rumped Munia is not a natural native of Singapore, having
been introduced from Indonesia in the 1920s. However, it ranks firmly as
an established local bird nowadays. The secret of its success in Singapore
is attributed by Hails and Jarvis (1987) to its habit of feeding on lawn
grasses, Bermuda Grass, Buffalo Grass, etc., where the seed heads are found
close to the ground. It is widespread, being found on lawns, open parkland,
grassland and open scrub. However, it is not exclusively a ground feeder,
and may be found feeding in tall grasses or trees and shrubs. I have seen it
feeding on paddy in Indonesia and the bird dealers in Jakarta and Surabaya
feed it on bunches of dry paddy.
It is a smallish munia, between the size of a Bronze-wing L. cucullata
and the Striated Munia L. striata. Those I have measured ranged between
99 mm and 103 mm, about four inches. The forehead, face, throat and
breast are black with a purplish sheen on fit adult birds in fresh plumage;
the rump, upper tail coverts and under tail coverts are black, the rest of
the upper parts are medium brown. The lower breast, belly and flanks are
white. The upper mandible is blackish, the lower pale greyish-blue, the
irides dark brown, the legs and feet grey. There are no visible differences
between the sexes; however, on one pair of mine that bred (and another
pair that did not) there were distinct differences in the flank markings (see
illustration). These birds were probably first year adults in basic definitive
plumage; when they moulted into adult definitive plumage, the breast

Comparative flank feathers from Lonchura leucogastroides
First year adults
became clear white with no flank markings.
The immature is all brown where the adult is brown or black, more
chestnut in the parts that remain brown, darker to blackish where the
adult becomes black. The belly and flanks are distinctly buff to cream
with some streaking. The first year adult retains some brown streaking on
the lower breast and flanks, and shows pale shaft streaks on the feathers
of the mantle and scapulars. This has led to the bird being advertised and
sold as Striated Munia L. striata , despite the fact that for obvious reasons
the Striated may be referred to as the White-rumped Munia. The full
adult, in my experience, loses the pale shaft striations, leaving the back
virtually even brown. This does not accord with Goodwin (1982) who
appears to describe only immatures and young adults. I have seen several
hundred of the birds and must admit that those that I have described
as first year adults far outnumber the full adults.
The song and display is typical munia, but lacks the penetrating peee
notes of the atricapilla group. It is similar to the Bengalese L. striata dom.
but lacks the volume, at least when compared to my particularly voci-
ferous specimen. I have noticed in several munias now, that the contact
call note between male and female is a different pitch. This is particularly
noticeable if the birds are separated and is a certain way of sexing them.
My birds came from Indonesia in August 1985. Every bird in the ship-
ment was in first year adult plumage. I selected five birds that I judged
to be two males and three females by the ridge-of-the-culmen method (see
sketch). The idea here is that the ridge where the culmen joins the fore-
head is more pronounced on male birds than on females. It is very diffi-
cult to see this, my sketch is a deliberate exaggeration, but it is relatively
easy to feel. I then confirmed my diagnosis by my trusty paperclip-on-
cotton pendulum sex-diviner, and was thrilled to end up really with what

I had wanted.
I placed the five in a 6 ft long (1.83 m) flight cage with a large double
roll of 3 in (0.06 m) plastic mesh stuffed with straw on the back wall, and
large nesting sites (see sketch) at each end. Nests were build in the straw
tenement and eggs laid. The egg is typically pure white, 14 mm long,
10 mm wide, oval-shaped and wider at one end. Eventually a nest was built
in the separate sites at either end, one of them having a 'cock's nest' on top
but being an integral part of the structure. They settled into two natural
pairs with one male being very dominant over the other, chasing it persis-
tently. I removed the subordinate pair and the odd female and released
them into the outdoor planted aviary. They seemed happy enough, but
preferred to stay in the shelter where they nested in a 3 x 3 ft tenement
of straw-stuffed, 3 in plastic mesh. They were all found dead in a nest
during the winter of 1986-87. The remaining pair stayed together in the
large cage.

In October 1986 I visited the dealer from whom I had obtained the
birds a year previously. To my surprise I saw seven or eight fresh Black-
ramped Munias in one of his stock cages. They were labelled 'English-bred
Striated Munias, #8 pr\ Apparently a customer who had bought two
pairs earlier that year had put them out in his garden aviary with his
other small birds, and '....they produced 18 young. He'd brought them
into the shop because they bred too easily and had become a nuisance'.
I tried to find out who the man was, but 'he's just some fellow who
walked in', and he remains anonymous still. He presumably is the first
person to have bred the species in the UK.
Somewhat depressed by the apparent ease with which somebody had
produced substantial numbers from a munia virtually unknown to British
aviculture, I went home to stare glumly at my own Black-ramps. A month
later, while I was away on one of my only too frequent trips abroad, they
produced two young with obviously no difficulty on a diet of mixed
seeds, millet sprays and occasional lettuce. One more adult died during
the winter this year, again while I was away (this time on a five-week
trip) so I was left with the two own-bred and an odd female. The young
male has paired with her and they laid but failed to hatch in April. At the
time of writing (May 1987) they have settled down to breeding (?) once
again.
The Black-ramped or Java Munia must have been imported from time
to time, although finch shipments from Jakarta go mostly to Germany. In
that country it is correctly identified and is known to be a free breeder in
captivity. In a letter published in Cage and Aviary Birds in August 1986,
A.E. Nachrichter reported that four breeders had produced 38 young from
five pairs. That suggests clearly that it will breed as a solitary pair and not
necessarily in the company of its own kind.
Identification obviously is a problem. It may be confused with L. stri-
ata of the White-bellied Munia L. leucogastra , but the latter from Malaysia
and Thailand is rarely imported. If so, I strongly suspect it too would be
sold as L. striata. I hope my sketches help with identifications.

INCUBATOR HATCHING AND EARLY HAND-REARING
OF AN UMBRELLA COCKATOO Cacatua alba

(Epsom, Surrey)
Every year brings to the aviculturist its thrills and sorrows; the summer
of 1986 brought us the unique pleasure and experience of becoming
very unexpectedly engaged in the incubator hatching and early stages of
hand-rearing an Umbrella Cockatoo.
A pair of these beautiful birds, owned by a friend, have produced a
number of young but on this particular occasion, for reasons unknown,
the hen had deserted the nest. By the time this was noticed an egg, which
had been there for some time, was cold.
It was not thought that it was fertile, but my husband and I were asked
to take a look. Hatching should have taken place nearly a week previously,
and since on careful inspection it rather looked like a case of 'dead-in-shell',
we were requested to open the egg because our friend wished to know
more about what had gone wrong with the development of the embryo.
A pin hole was first made in the air cavity, but on listening I could
detect no sign of life. Proceeding with very great care the pin hole was
gradually enlarged to reveal a terribly dry and hard inner skin, somewhat
shrunken within the outer shell. It seemed impossible that life could sur-
vive within that desiccated inner covering.
Using a miniature penknife, a very small cut was made in the dry
skin (membrane) covering the embryo. A very slight bleeding appeared -
that meant life; immediate action was obviously necessary to save the
chick. I asked my friend to give me half a hen's eggshell quickly. Within
about a quarter of a minute this was fitted, rather loosely, over the opened
area of the Cockatoo egg, which was wrapped very carefully in a small
towel and placed on a warmed water bottle.
My husband and I brought the egg on the 10-minute car journey to
our home and it was fortunate that we had at that time our smaller incu-
bator, a Marsh Turn X, running and adjusted to receive eggs. The Cocka-
too egg, with its protecting 'hat' of half a hen's eggshell, was put in the
incubator in a small plastic box covered with a piece of clear perspex,
which kept the air from the fan away from the egg and allowed it to be
seen. The reason for the covered container was to prevent the incubator's
circulating air from drying out the membrane. The incubator's turning
equipment was switched off at the same time. The temperature was 99.5*F
(37.5*C) and the humidity was maximum; the entire incubator was flooded.

About four hours later the egg was inspected and it was already begin-
ning to change, from the 'dead', desiccated look to the healthy appearance
of a live embryo. The bright red veins of a very much alive chick, not yet
ready to hatch, were clearly visible. The outer membrane or skin was at
this stage moistened with warm, distilled water and the egg was returned
to the incubator.
The next day, when the egg was taken out, no further progress had
been made by the chick; the membrane was moistened again and the egg
returned to the incubator. By the evening of the second day the vascular
pattern had altered, the veins having disappeared, leaving a very dark red
pattern. The membrane was still very tough, and at this stage hatching
should have been imminent, but it was obvious from the weak calls of
the chick that it needed help.
With a tiny sterilised knife I carefully cut the membrane just sufficiently
to release the beak, this enabling the chick to breathe freely. The mem-
brane was moistened again with warmed distilled water, and a tiny drop
was dripped on to the beak of the chick. This was repeated about three
hours later, but this time glucodine was added to the warm water dripped
on to the chick's beak, which was by now opening to accept the 'drink'. The
quantity of glucodine was as much as would go on the tip of a pointed
kitchen knife to a teaspoonful of boiled, lukewarm water.
Early in the morning of the third day it was decided to assist the chick
further, so bits of outer shell and inner membrane and skin were removed
with infinite care at intervals during the day, always bearing in mind that
the chick could not be long out of the warmth of the incubator. By late
evening the chick was 'sitting' in a sort of 'cup' consisting of the remaining
bit of outer shell and the portion of membrane protecting the egg sac. It
was realised, of course, that any damage to this vital part could cause the
death of the chick. Glucodine and warm water were being taken regular-
ly now in tiny quantities. The above exercise was doubtless as exhausting
to the chick as it was to me because of the extreme care necessary, so it
was decided to leave the chick for the night to see if it could free itself of
the last 'egg cup' of shell, etc.
At 5.30 a.m. on the following morning I took the chick out to give it
some obviously welcome glucodine and warm water, and having prepared
a slightly warmed saucer, tipped the chick very gently on to its side. It fell
out of its 'cup' without further problems, the egg sac having been com-
pletely retracted. A healthy, if tired, chick was then returned to the incu-
bator.
Two hours later the chick was given its first feed from a tiny spoon.
This consisted of equal quantities of pure yoghourt and a Heinz fruit
juice for babies, called at that time 'Fruit Desert'; this was mixed with

boiled warm water to the consistency of skimmed milk. The second meal,
two hours later, was one part Heinz baby fruit juice, one part Milupa
'Autumn Fruit Harvest' (a baby food) and one part Prewett's Oat Bran and
Oat Germ (from health food shops), mixed with warm s boiled water to the
consistency of skimmed milk, as before. This meant that the solids were
approximately 10% of the whole. Great care was taken not to overload the
tiny crop. The third feed was the same as the second except that instead of
the Milupa baby food, one quarter part of Cow and Gate 'Beef and Bone
Broth' (a baby food) was given, the whole being brought to the same con-
sistency. This broth was only given once per day, which seems sufficient to
help with the bone-building process.
At this stage the chick was weighed; it was 20 grams exactly and it was
transferred to a very small, tissue-lined box and put in a brooder. The tem-
perature was kept at 99.5* F (37.5*C). Feeding continued every two
hours until 12.30 a.m.; the next feed was at 3.30 a.m., followed by one at
6.00 a.m., when the two hour feeding was resumed. Colour photographs
were taken on the first day, and at intervals, to record the chick's progress.
By day three the chick weighed a fraction over 20 grams, and had its
last dose of yoghourt, which had been given once per day. There seems to
be a great deal of difference of opinion about whether or not yoghourt can
be assimilated successfully by baby parrot-type birds. It was decided not
to experiment with this rather special chick which was not owned by us,
but to continue with a tried routine of giving the chick a tiny quantity of
diluted yoghourt once per day for the first three days.
On day four the chick weighed 20.5 grams and was doing well. A small
quantity, equivalent to about half a part of soaked, chopped and tho-
roughly crushed sunflower kernels was introduced to the feed, plus one
part of Milupa 'Mixed Vegetable' variety, and one tiny drop of Collo-Cal-
D was added as well. This was repeated on day five, but that night the
chick became very ill and lost his voice. The heat was maintained at 99.5*F
(37.5*C) and a little warm, boiled water was given at intervals.
The chick was much better on day six, but the Milupa Mixed Vegetables
variety, the soaked sunflower kernels, the Collo-Cal-D and the Beef and
Bone broth were all excluded from the food. On day seven the chick
weighed 30 grams, and was not fed for five and a half hours during the
night. The Beef and Bone broth was reintroduced and one tiny drop of
Collo-Cal-D was given once during the day. This is a very good source of
D^, and a good bone builder; it must be obtained from a veterinarian. Pro-
vided that it is given very sparingly, baby parrot-type chicks seem to be
able to tolerate it quite well.
At this stage the quantities of the mixture of foods were altered to half

a part of fruit juice, two parts oat bran and oat germ (Prewett's) and two
parts of Milupa 'Autumn Fruit Harvest 5 . The Milupa 'Mixed Vegetables'
variety was not tried again as its content of many sorts of vegetables did
not seem to suit the chick.
At the beginning of the eighth day the young bird slept happily from
12.30 a.m. to 6.30 a.m. A mere dusting or peppering of ground cuttlefish
'bone' was now added to one feed per day, and the Beef and Bone broth
was increased to half a part, and, as before, given only once daily. The
temperature had been gradually reduced to 96-94-then 92*F (approxima-
tely 35.5-34.5-33.5*C). Half a part of dry sunflower kernels, ground in a
coffee grinder and then put through a fine sieve was introduced to the
food. A few days later this was increased to one part. It was fed once per
day. The Collo-Cal-D was continued, giving one drop in one feed per day.
By day ten the Umbrella chick was strong and well, with a tremendous
will of his own, and quite a loud voice. He (she) weighed 40 grams. Well
wrapped up and sitting in a box with two well insulated hot water bottles,
the young bird was taken the short car journey to his owner and installed
in a brooder. As time went by, foods such as very finely grated raw carrot
and very finely chopped lettuce and cabbage were introduced, also finely
chopped, cooked sweet corn. Soaked sunflower kernels were supplied as
the baby grew older. Photographs of the young bird's progress continued
to be taken. At the age of approximately five months he went to his
future home where, according to reports, he very nearly rules the house.
If there is something to learn from this experience, it is that one should
never be in a hurry to discard an egg.

MIXED-SPECIES WALK-THROUGH AVIARIES
BLESSING OR BURDEN?

and BRUCE BOHMKE (Curator of Birds, St. Louis Zoo, Miss., USA)
Zoo design is a rapidly evolving field. Changes in exhibit philosophy,
as well as technology, have meant vast improvements in the way animals
are kept in zoos. It is no longer sufficient to build exhibits based only on
their ability to contain the animals; now the emphasis is on exhibiting
them in natural habitats.
In the avian field, one of the most obvious outcomes of this changing
attitude is the walk-through, mixed-species aviary. The zoo visitor has
become less tolerant of caged animals peering through bars and more
aware of animals 'Born Free'. This design satisfies the desires of the visitor;
in a well-planted, natural setting the visitor perceives the birds to be free.
By being in the exhibit with the birds, he shares their environment and is
much more aware of the sights, smells and sounds around him. It also, of
course, permits the creation of spectacular displays of plants and flowers,
particularly tropical species so that often it is as much a botanical as
zoological exhibit.
This style of exhibit gained popularity very quickly and numerous
zoos have constructed similar style exhibits over the last two decades.
Clearly the goal of these early flight cages was primarily to serve as a
positive experience for the visitor; a striking exhibition to impress them
with large numbers of birds and plenty of flash and colour. In an article
in the International Zoo Yearbook 1975, Kerry Muller describes the
exhibit philosophy behind some of the early flight cages.
'Their entire concern is with providing a spectacle for the public.
the sole criteria for their choice being colour, size and variety'. In a paper
given at a 1975 meeting of the American Association of Zoological Parks
and Aquaria, Bob McMorris describes the same sort of outdated exhibit
criteria: '.the decision as to which birds were placed in this exhibit was
based originally on color and not compatibility'.
The old exhibits still exist and new ones are being built almost annually.
Have the goals of such an exhibit changed? With conservation being the
cry of zoos in the 1970s and 1980s, are the flight cages reflecting this
change in animal management philosophy? To a great extent they are. The
numerous articles that are written about such aviaries fall into two cate-
gories: 1) those written at the time of the opening, e.g. Klos(1962), Mot-
tershead (1966), Griswold (1972), Lint (1960); 2) those written years

later as renovations and improvements are needed, eg. Reuther (1973),
Reed (1966). For the most part, the improvements are a shift from the
emphasis on visitor satisfaction to meeting the needs of the birds.
The changes were prompted by several factors. Conservation has gained
importance and these aviaries typically had low reproductive potential and
high mortality. At the same time, education and the quality of the visitors'
experience has received increased attention. The goal is no longer just to
expose the public to a large variety of species. To teach them fully about
a species, it is necessary to simulate its natural environment.
The biggest change has come in the number of birds that zoos have
attempted to exhibit in these aviaries, and the numbers of species and
specimens have been greatly reduced. Many aviaries of the 1960s had a
density of birds equivalent to one bird for every 25-50 ft^ (7.6-15.5 m^).
By contrast, ten zoos contacted recently reported an average of well over
100 ft^ (30.5 m^). More of an effort has been made to exhibit species in
pairs and many zoos have tried to develop a unifying theme, such as a
common geographical origin to illustrate how the species would co-exist
in the wild. Although this is a step in the right direction in concept, new
problems have been generated. Paired species that are nesting are much
more territorial and aggressive towards other birds. Nesting mortality is
high. The 'theme' concept limits the choice of potentially compatible
species.
Some of the biggest problems with such an exhibit are inherent in its
design and can be managed to some extent but not solved. The lack of
control, inability to capture individuals or at times to obtain an accurate
inventory are the major frustrations expressed by zoo aviculturists. Other
</bodyText>

aspects such as plant care, pest control, graphics, and new bird intro-
ductions can all be handled in some fashion (see Appendix 1). However,
even with all the problems involved, it is still recognised that these are
very popular exhibits and if managed properly, mortality can be mini-

mised and breeding potential maximised. Such exhibits can be very effec-
tive and if the limitations are not ignored, the avian population need not
suffer.
With that in mind, it seems that the best way to minimise significant
losses in this style of exhibit is through the careful selection of species.
There is always a risk involved in releasing a bird into a flight cage, or
any new environment, but that is why it is so critical to take into account
the availability of the species when selecting birds to be exhibited. The
status in the wild as well as in captivity should be evaluated and well-
established, commonly captive-bred species should be chosen rather than
rarer ones. Many institutions have active off-display breeding facilities,

giving them the potential to become their own suppliers, restocking the
aviary with captive-bred offspring. Fortunately, some species have done
so well in captivity that the current need to reproduce them has decreased.
As long as their status is carefully monitored and maintained, these species
are a good choice. The White-cheeked Touraco and the Superb Starling are
two examples. In 1966 the International Zoo Yearbook reported less than

two White-cheeked Touracos, hatched in one zoo, in 1966 but in 1984,
50 Touracos were produced, at 14 zoos.
There are a number of species whose populations in captivity are
excessively of one sex. Though not yet well-established in captivity, they
are still a good choice because they are not depleting a potential breeding
population, e.g. the Naked-throated Bellbird.
Reproduction in these large aviaries is certainly not impossible; a
number of zoos do quite well, but most still express the attitude that the
birds breed in the flight cage despite the obstacles. In a survey of 10 zoos,
31% of the species housed in flight aviaries exhibited some reproductive
behaviour. The survival rate of young, however, was only 18%. Most
successful reproduction occurred in larger, relatively aggressive groups of
birds such as waterfowl, starlings, rails and pheasants. Clearly, some
species do benefit from the spaciousness of a large, planted aviary. Ham-
merkops, with their large nest requirements, are a good example.
The responsibility rests with us to practice what we preach. Aviculture
has made great progress in captive reproduction programmes and these
should not be compromised by reverting to exhibits for show only. Vast
improvements in techniques have greatly increased the compatibility
between 'display' and 'conservation'. Exchange of information and
experience through publications such as the International Zoo Yearbook
and the Avicultural Magazine is vital and there is still a need for curators
of mixed collections, both publicly and privately owned, to realise this.
There is so much to be gained by everyone from this sort of co-opera-
tion but much valuable data still goes unrecorded because of a general
reluctance to write on the part of zoo curators and private owners.
If we make the effort, we have the ability to reduce mortality, increase
reproduction, improve education and conserve rare species without sacri-
ficing the public's enjoyment.

A DESCRIPTION OF THE TODY FAMILY

Belonging to the Order Coraciiformes, this monotypic family Todidae,
consisting of the genus Todus, is made up of five Greater Antillean species.
Termed by some ornithologists as a 'superspecies', these diminutive,
short-tailed avian gems have features that are somewhere between those of
the motmots and the kingfishers. They are, in fact, very closely related to
the former, and distantly to the latter. They are also reminiscent of
miniature puffbirds, complete with rectal bristles, exemplifying their
almost exclusively insectivorous diet (Bond, 1980).
They catch their food in a very similar manner to that of RedstartsMy/o-
borus and Tody-flycatchers Todirostrum , and this is explained very well
by Ann Keplar (1977). She divides the feeding methods into two principal
and four subsidiary foraging techniques. Leaf-feeding (87%) and air-feed-
ing (8.8%) are the preferred methods and embrace the major portion of
time spent foraging, whereas hovering and tree-trunk snapping are secon-
dary. Keplar also found that the diet consists mainly of small flies, beetles
and lantern flies, and is supplemented by crickets, grasshoppers, cock-
roaches, moths, caterpillars, other insects and spiders. Although todies are
quite territorial, at times they join temporarily with interspecific feeding
flocks passing through their tract.
Vocalisations produced by todies are simple, unmusical whistles, buzzy
and nasal, but are quite distinctive between the species (Keplar, 1977). A
4 slightly-rattling whirr' or 'snapping' during flight is also characteristic.
This unusual sound is due to an attenuated outer primary feather. So
unique is this sound that it is often used as a means of tracking these wren-
sized birds amongst the dense foliage. Outside the breeding season, which
lasts from January to May, they are seldom vocal, although when chasing
prey, a wooden 'snap-snap' is very often heard which is made by the large
hollow beak while catching insects (Gruber, 1981).
Tunnel nesters
Like practically all other Coraciiformes, todies nest in self-excavated,
short tunnel holes, utilising banks in like manner with bee-eaters and some
kingfishers. However, unlike the mostly colonial nesting habits of bee-
eaters (Meropidae), todies are not gregarious. They neither flock, nor nest
socially, but rather prefer to select a suitable bank within their home range
and vigorously defend their territories during the breeding season (Keplar,

1977). As with all Coraciiformes, male and female build their subterranean
nest collectively. So strong is the pair bond that the majority of todies
remain coupled throughout the year (Gruber, 1981).
Todies seem to prefer semi-circular-shaped, vertical banks, often shel-
tered by branches, roots or rocks to minimise erosion. However, they will
also use virtually anything similar from shallow-sloping ground, to dried
cattle hoofprints, to old tyre tracks (Keplar, 1977; Lack, 1976). Almost
any easily excavated soil is used, although marl or clayish banks are most
popular. After constructing a curved, 30-45 cm long burrow with an un-
lined nest chamber at the end, the hen will lay a single clutch of one to
four glossy white eggs; these are the smallest in the family.
The incubation period lasts 21-22 days. While both sexes share in the
incubating, the female devotes more time to it (Keplar, 1977). During this
period, some todies welcome the assistance of nest-helpers. These helpers
are scant, and seem to be most prevalent in the nestling phase. Young
fledge in about three weeks and are fully weaned by their sixth week,
yet in captivity they average slightly longer (Gonzalez, 1976). Throughout
this nestling phase, todies are most vulnerable to predation, and many fall
victim. Besides their major threat, the mongoose, they must also contend
with rats, other birds, humans and miscellaneous creatures which also use
burrows.
Agriculture
If ever a list of the most appreciated birds was compiled by farmers in
the West Indies, the todies would surely be at the top. Being insectivorous
they wreak havoc on insects in tropical plantations. It is easy to under-
stand why they are legally protected throughout most of their range. Even
so, todies and their eggs are still fair game for villagers seeking supplemen-
tary protein. Fortunately, this problem is locally insular. Suffice to say,
todies are abundant and their populations are quite stable.

Aviculture
The captive history of todies is quite scanty, and good literature about
them is equally limited. Todus species have been housed in only a handful
of zoological and private avicultural collections and never with much suc-
cess. The fact that these insectivorous birds also have a high metabolism
is the main reason why they do not thrive for any appreciable time.Todies
consume a minimum of 40% of their own body weight in insects daily
during the non-breeding season (Griswald, 1959). Although some literature
claims that the very rarely kept tody can be maintained properly on a
simple diet of mealworms, fruitflies and crickets, I disagree. Not only is
this wrong and misleading but shows an unfamiliarity with the Corach-
formes generally. The mere fact that todies devour such a wide variety and
quantity of insects, reflects the obvious difficulty in its captive survival.
From past experiences, I have found that immature todies offer the best
results, as do young adults (one to two years old) which were banded in
the wild as immatures, and then captured after one or two breeding sea-
sons. Fortunately todies are quite docile, lending themselves as good avi-
cultural subjects once the problem of initial captive establishment is over-

As mentioned, most of the sparse literature available on Todus is con-
tained within general avian works or field guides. But it is interesting to
note a fine monograph of Todidae published in 1977 by the Nuttall Orni-
thological Club, written by Angela K. Keplar, PhD. Although the frame-
work centres on Todus mexicanus, it also contains pertinent and useful
information on all of the five Todus species. This book is undoubtedly the
finest ornithological literature on todies to date. Anyone interested in ob-
taining a copy of this monograph should contact the Nuttall Ornitholo-
gical Club, c/o Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University,

Articles on tanagers have disappeared from the literature in the past
decade. This is perhaps due to the lack of availability of these attractive
and easily-managed birds. As the Silver-beaked Tanager has been widely
kept (and bred too) in the past, these notes will be restricted in detail.
Anyone wishing general information on tanagers should begin by
reading A.F. Skutch's Life Histories of Central American Birds (1954: Pac-
ific Coast Avifauna 31, Berkeley) .
The Silver-beaked is not the brightest coloured of tanagers but its at-
tractiveness lies as much in the texture of the feathers as in the colour.
When in breeding condition, both the male and the female have a deep
plush appearance on the head and shoulders. The male should be a rich
dark maroon all over, while the female should have a somewhat less in-
tense shade on her head and neck, the rest of her feathers being dark
chocolate brown, just tinged with maroon. The male, of course, has a
swollen silver lower mandible.
When I obtained these tanagers in summer, they were (for a change!)
in good condition, except that they were in poor colour and their wings
were frayed from beating about in the carrying cage. They never ever
calmed down and, along with Garrulax canorus (Melodious Laughing
Thrush or Hwamei) ranked as the most nervous birds ever kept. Thus
they should be kept in a bushy aviary rather than in a cage. Juveniles
born in captivity were almost as wild as the parents and never calmed
down either.
The tanagers were put out in a heavily planted conservatory where
they immediately disappeared into the foliage and rarely showed them-
selves thereafter.
The shelter was a lean-to aviary built on the south side of the house
from acrylic sheeting. It measures 18x9x10 ft high (5.48 x 2.74 x
3.04 m)and is heavily planted with, among other things, a lemon tree,
fig tree, loquat tree, several large camellias and a clump of fine-leaved
bamboo. This place never quite drops to freezing in the winter and is
heated by solar absorption.
The birds settled well and by the end of October had moulted into
very fine feathering. Unlike the Chloropsis and Shama with which they
shared the enclosure, they were nervous of intrusion and fled at speed

right through the foliage to the far end. They were the only birds that
were able to fly straight through thick plants. The tanagers never molested
the other birds, but maintained a bold front in the face of the other two
quarrelsome types, and so were never bullied.
They were easily catered for with a basic diet of sweet rice pudding
(boiled in milk), bread with peanut butter and the few mealworms that,
because of their speed, they were able to snatch from under the bills of
their tamer room-mates. Frequently they drank the nectar put in for the
Chloropsis, and ate sparingly of the latters' banana. A preferred food
which the tanagers took with great eagerness was any soft berry in season.
These included blueberries, blackberries and raspberries. However, they
would not touch any hard berries, like holly or pyracantha.
A bath was permanently available and no doubt they took regular ad-
vantage of this but, because of their jittery disposition, were rarely ob-
served bathing.
They passed the winter looking very fit, the male weighing 33 g and the
female half a gram lighter. At the end of December, the hen was seen
carrying a leaf, but no other activity was noted until the spring.
On 1st March, the hen was seen displaying to the cock, who remained
hidden in a bush. She fanned her tail, bobbing it up and down, bowing all
the while. Later in the year she was seen to repeat this display while
holding a twig. Again the male remained out of sight. He was never seen
displaying but on three occasions was heard to sing a rapid, thin, high-
pitched song quietly into the ear of the hen. This song was similar in style
to that of Cyanerpes cyaneus. The cock also made a quiet chirp at the
feeding tray to bring down the hen, but otherwise they were very quiet,
communicating during the rest of the year with a single piping note.
In a 14-month period, from March to May of the following year, nine
nests were built. Seven of these were in the conservatory and two were
outside in a small, roofed-in, planted flight. The nest-building months were
March, April, May, June and September. Although of loose, rather open
construction, all the nests were well made and well anchored. In contrast
to many other nests, they never disintegrated while in use and so never
needed to be shored up. The spot chosen for building was always in the
densest and darkest spot available. No nest was used twice so new nests
were usually built very close to the old ones, at from 114-5 ft up (0.46 -
1.52 m). Nests were well camouflaged and difficult to see.
Construction materials were always the same. A base was built of light
twigs and stems running into sides of dark, dried leaves. There was a sparse
lining of dry grass and horse hair. A single exception to this was when one
nest was given a thick lining of horse hair.
The nest was built quickly, usually in two days, by the hen who added

a few finishing touches over the next three to four days until she laid. The
nest was deep and the hen sat well down in it with only her tail sticking
out.
Average measurements of the nests were: Outer diameter 4 in (0.10 m);
inner diameter 2% in (0.07 m); outer depth 2% in; inner depth l%in
(0.04 m). These match well with Ingels' measurements of wild nests.
The birds always left and approached the nest from below.
The approach was one of extreme caution, particularly with the hen
when she was on eggs. She always went to the nest by a low-level, circui-
tous route, stopping on every twig to look and listen for danger. The cock
attacked the other birds present only if they landed on the nesting bush,
but otherwise there was no trouble.
Prior to egg-laying the hen avidly ate eggshell. She was seen to eat half
a square inch (1.3 cm z ) at one sitting.
Nineteen eggs were laid in nine clutches. The earliest was laid on 7th
and 8th March when the daytime temperature in the aviary rose to 64*F
(18*C) and fell to about 35*F (2*C) at night. The last clutch of the year
was laid in the outside aviary on 6th and 7th September when it was con-
siderably warmer. This last clutch was the only one from which both
chicks were reared.
The normal tanager clutch is two but there was one exception when
three eggs were laid. Sixteen hatched, the first clutch and one of the above
three eggs being infertile.
The egg is pale blue with inky black spots concentrated at the big end.
These blotches, up to 1 mm in size, could both be seen and felt to be
raised above the blue surface. The size, 17 x 25 mm, was the same as a
Hardwicke's Chloropsis egg, but the tanager's egg looked bigger and
rounder. By coincidence, the hen tanager and hen chloropsis weighed
within a gram of each other.
Incubation time, as with all small passerines, is 12 days. The first egg of
each clutch always hatched in the afternoon of the 12th day between
1 p.m. and 7 p.m., and the second egg hatched early the following morning
at exactly 12 days.
The plump chicks had a little dark down on their heads but were soon
covered with wispy dark grey down. The gape is blood-red. The feathering
and fledging pattern is also common to small passerines. The large black
eyes opened at six days, and chicks left the nest at 10 days, when they
could only flutter. They are similar in appearance to the non-breeding
adult female, but slightly lighter in colour.
Only the hen was seen feeding the chicks for the first three days. She
took them wasp larvae, mealworm pupae, spiders and moths. She also
used blueberries which had been stored in the freezer. Grasshoppers and

crickets were ignored by both parents, even for their own use.
From three days on, the cock also fed the chicks and in addition to the
above-mentioned foods, he conveniently used rice pudding and bread with
peanut butter and margarine. He had been feeding the hen on the nest
throughout the incubation with all of these items.
Chicks died with exasperating frequency, all between two and seven
days old. The causes of death were not determined.
Some fragments of hen eggshell were found in the stomach of a week-
old chick.
As already noted, in only one case was the complete clutch fledged.
The deaths of other chicks were all the more mysterious, when their nest-
mates survived on three occasions.
One chick was kept and it overwintered with the parents. When the
adults renested in the spring, the juvenile interfered mildly with the nest-
budding and was thought to be a hen. It was not molested by either
parent. When the young bird was eight months old, all three were sold to
the same buyer. I was later told that 'at about 10 months' the young
bird moulted into the adult male colour and was dead six weeks later,
presumably killed by the old male.

ON SOME NEW COLOUR VARIETIES OF THE
BARBARY DOVE
By DEREK GOODWIN

In 1982 I made an appeal in our magazine for transatlantic readers to
enlighten us as to the new colour varieties of the Barbary Dove produced
in recent decades in the USA and/or Canada. Alas, either no informed
dove addicts read my article (perhaps, horrid thought, no one reads my
articles!) or if they did, they remained unmoved by the appeal.
Recently, however, I received from a German friend a copy of Die Ge-
fiederte Welt , the excellent German journal on aviculture and cage bird
keeping, for May 1987, which contains an article: 'Zuchtformen der
Lachtaube' (= Domestic varieties of the Barbary Dove) by Hans-Dieter
Fritsch.
From it I learn that in Europe also various new colour varieties of this
bird have appeared and been propagated in recent decades, though it
appears the initial appearances of some of them are still shrouded in
secrecy. I fear my knowledge of colloquial and bird fanciers' German is
insufficient for me to attempt a full translation of the article, lest I should
give wrong information here and there, so I shall not attempt to do so.
The paper is, however, illustrated with what appear to be good colour
photographs of a number of the new varieties, so I thought it might be of
interest if I describe them here.
There is, of course, the possibility that the colours may not have repro-
duced perfectly, indeed in one case I think one has not. One, however
shows five new coloured birds plus one of the normal (in domestication)
pale fawn variety, and as the colour reproduction of this latter bird is
good, I assume the others are too. They are as follows:
1) What looks to be a very pale version of the normal fawn with similar
red eyes but with a mainly flesh-coloured bill. The neck ring, though very
dark, seems not quite so black as on the normal bird. This bird is called
'Eisfarbig' (ice-coloured).
A paler version of this, with head and breast looking almost white but
still with the dark neck ring (very striking in contrast) is on the plate
showing five others (one the normal fawn bird) which is simply entitled
'Verschiedenfarbige Lachtauben' (differently coloured Barbary Doves).
2) A very similar bird to the above but with a gingery-brown neck
ring, entirely flesh-pink bill and a paler upper area in the red iris. It is sim-
ply entitled 'Mit braunen Halsring' (with brown collar).

3) What looks in the picture merely a slightly less pale and dingier ver-
sion of (1) but with paler and greyer primaries. It is named Tsabellfarbig'
(IsabeUine).
4) A bird which has the mantle and wing coverts a warm orange-brown,
some inner secondaries, scapulars, the upper tail coverts white edged with
orange-brown, the primaries and tail white, the head and breast a slightly
greyish and very pale fawn, the neck ring white , the iris dark and the bill a
pale flesh colour. It is named 'Lavendal 1984&amp;apos; (Lavender 1984).
Possibly the photograph does not do it justice as in the illustration of
the she birds there is one very similar (it may even be the same bird, taken
from the opposite side) but with the head, neck and breast of a pinkish
brown that does have a very faint lavender or bluish tinge.
Two other similar birds, one in the highest point of the bowing display,
are shown face-on in the same photograph. They appear similar but a
little paler in colour. Their backs, posterior parts of wings and tails cannot,
however, be seen.
These three latter reddish birds have bills (in the photograph) that ap-
pear dusky flesh merging to dark brown on the tip of the culmen.
Although the German name for this colour is 'lavender', it appears
very similar to 'dominant red', or one type of'dominant red', in domestic
pigeons. And, as with that colour in pigeons, it evidently is linked with
suppression of pigment in the normally dark parts of tail and primaries.
In the doves also in the normally dark neck ring, which in these birds is
white as has been said.
5) A bird is in the picture of the six, which is faced away from the
camera and so only upper parts are visible. It is a bright orange-brown on
the top of the head, wings and upper surface of the visible tail feathers,
rather paler on the nape and darker, almost a reddish chocolate, on the
hind neck and upper part of the mantle. It shows some indication of a
whitish neck ring but this is interrupted (as in the juvenile, but this bird
does not look to be in juvenile plumage) down the middle of the back of
the neck.
6) Two blotchy pied birds, the dark parts of their wings and tail appear-
ing in the photograph much darker than the wild colour. They are called
'Tigerschecken dunkel wildfarbig' (Tiger pied dark wild-coloured). They
reminded me of some similar pied birds (but with the dark parts of the
usual fawn, though looking darker against the white) that the Keston
Foreign Bird Farm had about 34 years ago and are, in my eyes, not at all
attractive.
So far as one can judge from the photograph, all except the tiger pied
birds seem rather attractive, though none more so than the 'old' fawn and

white varieties familiar to us oldsters from our childhood days. It is inter-
esting that the beautiful mauve pink tinge on the breast of the wild bird
does not seem to exist in similar intensity in any of these varieties, though
I am told that birds of the genuine wild colour can be had in the USA.
I have here described all the birds shown in the colour photos illustrating
the article. The author, however, gives a list of the varieties now (apparent-
ly) obtainable in Europe, of which I include a translation below. Possibly
some of the terms may be comparably euphemistic to the English use of
such words as 'blue', 'red', 'opal', etc., when applied to colour varieties of
domestic pigeons, or cats. I give a rough and somewhat condensed transla-
tion of the table heading, etc., but an exact and literal one of the colours
as named by Herr Fritsch.
Summary of the different Barbary Dove mutations, which has, however,
no claim to be comprehensive:
Pure white (albinos) with red eyes
Pure white with black eyes
White (partial albinos)
White (partial albinos) with brown neck ring
White with black neck ring (ice-coloured)
Ditto in ivory and silver
'California' ('see photo' but in fact no photo or description of this is
given)
Tiger-pied in colours of the whole spectrum
Wild-coloured light/or pink/or also heather-coloured
Isabelline to 'Lachs-' coloured
Wild-coloured to brown, in several gradations
Light wild-coloured orange (I cannot guess what this means!)
Yellow (old term for brownish); (I think this means the usual fawn
variety)
Red, orange, yellow, isabelline, lavender and violet, all with white neck
ring, sometimes with and sometimes without white tail and some-
times with white 'saddle'
Blue Barbary Doves are not yet firmly established, also black Barbary
Doves occur (the author mentions that these black mutants have so
far not proved viable)
It is to be hoped, if not expected, that some of my readers will give us
further information on the subject, especially on the varieties available in
the USA and their exact appearance.

By BRUCE W. BOHMKE
(Curator of Birds)
The St. Louis Zoo has displayed Giant HornbiUs for many years. The
pair at present on exhibit consists of a male which was added to the
collection in 1976 as an adult, and a female purchased in 1983 as an adult.
This pair has proved to be very compatible.
The Bird House was constructed at St. Louis Zoo in 1931, and renova-
ted in 1979. The birds are enclosed in exhibits by vertical stainless steel
wires which are maintained at a tension of 75 lbs, and are spaced 2.54 cm
apart. Walls of exhibits are composed of cement plaster painted a neutral
grey colour. Skylights throughout the building create a natural photo-
period. Each exhibit has a pool constructed of cement and stone.
The display originally housing the HornbiUs measures 2.8 m x 10.8 m x
3.7 m high. A section of Sycamore Tree Plantanus occidentalis constitutes
the nest cavity. This log measures 2.18 rn tall x 0.90 m in diameter, and
the circular opening on the side measures 0.40 m in diameter with the
bottom of the entrance hole 0.95 m from the ground. The top of the log
is covered with a piece of galvanised sheet metal. The female HornbUl sat
in the nest log for long periods of time during the spring of 1985, but she
neither laid an egg nor moulted. The size of the entrance hole to the nest
seemed to be too large. The male would attempt to pack food and faeces
on the edge of the nest hole, but the aperture was too great for the birds
to succeed in reducing the size of the hole significantly. The male would
occasionaUy sit with the female in the nest.
In April 1986 the Giant HornbiUs were moved to a different exhibit
measuring 2.8 x 6 x 3.7 m high. The enclosure included a Sycamore log
measuring 2.00 m tall and 0.80 m in diameter. The entrance hole, which is
oval-shaped, measures 0.25 cm high x 0.20 cm wide, with the bottom of
the entrance hole 1.40 m from the ground. After a short time in the new
exhibit the female HornbiU was sealed in the nest log by the male.
The material used to close the hole was a combination of soft fruit
faeces and wood shavings. The size of the remaining opening was 0.24 m
high x 0.064 m wide. The male fed the female a diet of diced fruit, includ-
ing apples, bananas, grapes, oranges, and a softbiU diet consisting of
chopped hard-boded egg, Bird of Prey diet 1 , gamebird chow 2 , trout

Giant Hornbill Chick, hatched May 1987 at the St. Louis Zoo
chow and Tune-up Brand Mockingbird mix . After 102 days the female
emerged from the nest. No indication of an egg or chick was discovered
but the female had moulted.
In October 1986, both birds were removed from the exhibit and separated.
The pair was put back in the same exhibit on 24th February, 1987, the log
having been filled with shredded oak bark to within 10 cm of the bottom
of the entrance hole. In the first week of March the male Hornbill began
to pack material around the sides of the nest hole. The female first joined
the male in this activity on 15th March and was seen inside the nest log on
18th March. By 3rd April the female Hornbill was sealed in the nest.
On 27th May, after the female had been in the nest log for 55 days, a
high-pitched begging call was heard by the keeper. The begging chick was
heard daily from then on, and on 9th June 1987, the young bird was first
seen through the feeding hole with the aid of a torch. The chick appeared
to be the size of a small bantam hen and was covered with white down.
Both the male and female were quite aggressive. On 21st June, the chick's
beak was seen at the feeding hole begging directly from the male. The
chick and the female emerged from the nest within the same hour on the
morning of 5th August. The female had moulted while confined in the

nest.
The adult hornbill diet was modified for the 1987 season by adding
cooked diced carrots, canned corn, cooked diced beets, and canned black-
eyed peas to the fruit mix. The softbill mix was switched to a commercial
preparation called Soft-billed Bird Diet, manufactured by Reliable Protein
Corporation 4 . When the bird's begging was first heard, crickets, newborn
and adult mice were added to the diet and these items were selected to be
fed first by the male.
When the chick emerged, it was slightly smaller than the female, but
very similar in appearance. Of course, the chick has no casque but it does
appear to have a small erectile crest on the top of the head where the
casque will be. This is particularly noticeable when the chick is excited.
The chick still begs from the adult to receive food four weeks after leav-
ing the nest log.
The history of Giant Hornbills breeding in captivity has been sporadic.
A number of changes were made in the husbandry of our Hornbills includ-
ing diet, nest log and exhibit. We hope that the chick produced in 1987 is
an indication that we are beginning to provide the essential ingredients for
successful reproduction.

The Yellow-faced Parrot Poicephalus flavifrom is also known as the
Yellow-fronted Parrot and Shoa Parrot. The sexes are similar and measure
26-28 cm in length. The general plumage colour is green; the forehead,
crown, around eyes and upper cheeks yellow; in some birds a touch of
yellow on the thighs and edge of wings is visible; the nape, mantle, back
and wings are green; the primaries are dark green, tipped with greenish
brown; the tail greenish black; the iris orange-red; the bill and upper
mandible are greyish black, the lower mandible greyish white; the legs
and toes are blackish grey. P.f aurantiiceps differs from the nominate
race in having orange on the forehead, cheeks and ear-coverts in place
of yellow. Immatures have the crown and upper cheeks yellowish olive.
The nominate race occurs in the northern and central regions of Ethiopia,
as far west as the Gurafarda Mountains. P.f aurantiiceps is known from
the Gila River area in Illubabor Province, in the south-western highlands
of Ethiopia. It probably integrates eastwards with flavifrons. It occurs
in Hagenia forests at an altitude of about 1,000-3,000 m.
The Senegal Parrot Poicephalus senegalus has been given alternative
names such as the Yellow-bellied Senegal Parrot and Yellow-vented Sene-
gal Parrot. P.s. versteri is known as the Scarlet-bellied or Red-vented
Senegal Parrot and P.s. mesotypus as the Orange-bellied or Kano Yellow-
vented Senegal Parrot. Their length is between 23-24 cm and the sexes
are similar. The crown, nape, chin and throat are blackish grey; the cheeks,
sides of face and ear-coverts are silvery grey; the upper breast, mantle,
back, scapulars and wing-coverts are bright grass green; the lower breast
and abdomen are yellow, tinged with orange; the primaries blackish brown
with outer webs washed with green; the under wing-coverts and under
tad-coverts yellow; the tail is brown washed with olive; the iris yellow; the
bill, legs and toes blackish grey. P.s. versteri differs from the nominate race
in having the abdomen red; the upperparts deeper green. P.s. mesotypus
differs in that the green of the upperparts and breast is paler and the
abdomen orange. P.s. senegalus is found in West Africa, from Senegal,
Gambia, southern Mali and Guinea including the Los Islands. P.s. versteri
ranges from the Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, Benin and north-western Ni-
geria. P.s. mesotypus occurs in eastern and north-eastern Nigeria, northern
Cameroon and south-western Chad. This species inhabits open forest,

preferring those where the Baobab Adansonia digitata lives (a grotesquely
fat tree, about 10-15 m in height, the bole in large specimens being about
28 m in circumference). It also inhabits the Borassus Palm (massive fan
palms with dark grey trunks and stiff crowns of greyish green leaves) and
the Locust-bean Tr eeParkia filicoidea.
Poicephalus gulielmi is usually known as Jar dine's Parrot, with alter-
natives given as the Red-crowned Parrot, Red-headed Parrot and Congo
Red-crowned Parrot. P.g. fantiensis is known as the Fantee or Gold Coast
Orange-crowned Parrot, P.g. massaicus as the Masai Red-headed Parrot and
P.g. permistus as the Eldoma Red-headed Parrot. The sexes are alike with a
length of 28 cm. The plumage is mainly dark green; the forehead, crown,
bend and lower edge of wings and thighs orange-red; the lores are blackish;
the mantle, back and scapulars blackish brown, each feather edged with
green; the rump yellowish green; the primaries, secondaries and tail are
blackish; the iris reddish brown; orbital ring pinkish white; the bill, upper
mandible is whitish, the lower mandible blackish; the legs and toes are
greyish brown. P.g. fantiensis differs from the nominate race in having the
forehead, crown and the edges of the wings orange instead of orange-red.
P.g. massaicus is paler than the nominate race with the rump and upper-
tail coverts lighter and more yellowish green; the mantle, back and scapu-
lars are more brownish, less blackish and there is less orange-red on the
forehead and crown. P.g. permistus is a doubtful subspecies which is said
to be intermediate between gulielmi and massaicus. Immatures are paler
and lack the orange-red on the forehead, edge of wings and thighs. The
range of the nominate race is southern Cameroon and Central African
Republic to northern Angola; P.g. fantiensis is found in Cameroon, Benin,
Ghana to Liberia. P.g. massaicus is a local common resident occuring at
1800-3250 m in the highland forests of southern Kenya and north-eastern
Tanzania from Mt. Elgon, the Cheranganis, Elgeyu, Mt. Kenya, parts of the
Crater Highlands and Mt. Kilimanjaro. P.g. permistus is confined to the
highlands of Kenya except in the south. It inhabits the Podocarpus forests
of Tanzania and Kenya, and tall trees adjacent to coffee plantations in
Angola. It has been recorded as living up to about 3,500 m where it
appears to be scarce in the west.
Yellow-faced Parrots have been observed in small flocks of 15-20 birds,
often in the company of Abyssinian Lovebirds Agapomis taranta. It is
reported to raid cultivated lands belonging to African tribesmen to take
their grain and millet in season. Fruit and seeds are procured from forest

is suspected that the site is a tree hole. I can find no records of this species
having been bred in aviaries anywhere in Africa. A pair that were kept for
some years in the aviaries of Mr. Herbert Whitley of Paignton, England,
also failed to breed.
The Senegal Parrot is usually observed in noisy flocks of up to 20 birds,
but in pairs during the breeding season. Occasionally a lone bird may be
seen. They are shy, wary birds and therefore difficult to approach. In
flight they are very conspicuous with their striking yellow underparts as
they fly swiftly with rapid wing beats. They feed on fruits, seeds and leaf
buds of indigenous trees. Raiding parties visit cultivated areas to feed on
maize, millet and groundnuts. They have been recorded feeding on the
fruit of Murula Sclerocarya caffra (globose to ovoid, soft, slimy pulp; seeds
nut-like, white), the seeds of the Ana Tree Acacia albida (pods contorted
and curved, initially green, later red blotches when mature), the fruit of
Small Sourplum Ximenia americana (oval, yellow to red when ripe, rather
sour but refreshing), Mahogany Khaya senegalensis (capsule woody, about
3-5 cm in diameter, splitting neatly into four to five valves; seeds winged),
Dinya Vitex cienkowskii (fruit glabrous, oblong-ellipsoid, 3 A in long, black
when ripe, sweet and edible), Madobia Pterocarpus erinaceus, Shea Butter
Trees Butyrospermum parkii and Sclerocarya birroea and young buds of
the Kassia tree.
In captivity these birds will accept a basic diet of two parts white or
striped sunflower, plus one part each of white millet, buckwheat and can-
ary seed. This may be supplemented with pine nuts, ground nut kernels,
grapes, apple, soft pear, orange, banana, figs and dried raisins and sultanas.
They are partial to millet sprays. Suitable green food includes spinach,
beet, celery, grated carrot and sprouted oats, sunflower and canary seeds.
As rearing food a mixture of soaked seed, boiled potato, sponge cake,
cheese, bread and butter pudding, bread and milk, corn-on-the cob (maize)
and hard-boiled egg is quite adequate.
Recorded breeding is in November (Senegal), from September onwards
elsewhere. A nest was found which contained two nestlings, one double
the size of the other with pin feathers visible on the head, wings and signs
of orange appearing on the breast; the other was well covered with grey
down. Nests in tree holes with the Baobab being a known site most
favoured. The three to four eggs are white, glossy with a single egg meas-
urement of 29.4 x 26.4 mm. The eggs are incubated by the female for 27-
29 days, the male feeding her at the nest, and also helping to feed the nest-
lings from the time of hatching until they become independent at 63-71
days. At the Scarlet Tanager Bird Park, South Africa, it was found that
during spells of cold weather, incubation took 25 days and on normal hot
days, 22 days were recorded (pers. comm. King, 1978).

The Jardine's Parrot is a shy, wary bird which is seldom heard while
feeding, but in flight constantly utters high pitched screeching. Flight is
swift and direct, performed with rapid wing strokes. It is a social species,
being found in small parties of up to ten birds, with larger flocks occurring
when food is plentiful. This parrot feeds on seeds, nuts, fruit and berries
and the contents of one stomach revealed pieces of a few insects. They
have been observed feeding in the company of Sharpe's Starlings Pholia
sharpii and Rameron Pigeons Columba arquatrix. It has been recorded
feeding on the flowers or seeds of the Australian Silver Oak Grevillea
robusta (showy golden orange flower spikes appear in spring and are rich
in nectar), the pods of Spathodea spp. (a genus of two or three evergreen
trees native to tropical Africa), Podacarpus spp. (yellow wood family),
Cedrus spp. (cypress family), including wild olives and oil palm nuts.
Captive birds will accept a similar diet to Senegals with additional greens
in the form of watercress, peas in the pod, broccoli and young cabbage
stalks; fruit including guava, paw-paw, mulberries and litchees; soft food
extras, namely toast crusts, trifle, boiled rice, moistened dog cubes, putu
yoghurt, crushed or grated coconut and breakfast cereals. A survey has
revealed that the Senegal and Jardine's Parrots will accept the following
fruits:

OF CRESTED BARBETS AND RED-FACED COLIES
By LOUISE REID HENRY
(Westray, Scotland)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998104666666667" page_id="56240630"  page_num="168" year="" vol="">
Many members of the Avicultural Society knew my late husband,
David Reid Henry, who was a familiar figure at social meetings. He was
known to many more members for the numerous coloured plates that he
painted for the Avicultural Magazine and the regular articles that he
contributed between 1956 and 1971. He was acknowledged to be
one of the world's greatest painters of birds, particularly raptors, but his
life was cut tragically short by illness in 1977, at the age of 58.
After our marriage in 1976 David and I established an aviary in the
garden of our house in Zimbabwe, the object being to provide models for
David's paintings.
We filled the aviary with various birds that came into our hands, 'win-
dow bashers', road traffic accidents and other casualties. If the birds
recovered and were happy in captivity, they remained with us. Others
which clearly did not appreciate the restrictions on their freedom were
released if they were well enough, once they had paid the rent by posing
for David to sketch them.
We acquired two Crested Barbets, I forget the circumstances, the cock
clearly distinguishable by his heavier bill, though they were otherwise
identical. They settled down quickly and happily and adapted easily to
the diet we provided: chopped ox heart mixed with a high protein flaky
baby food called Pro Nutro, mixed with some fresh fruit.
One quiet Sunday afternoon there was a great commotion at the
aviary. A wild cock Barbet turned up and he and our aviary cock were
'churring' away at each other, trying to clutch each other through the
wire and displaying in a way that we had not observed before. Instead of
the crest being further erected, it was depressed flat, as were the feathers
of the upper part of the body, but the feathers of the legs and under the
tail were fluffed out so that each bird resembled nothing so much as
a highly coloured and highly agitated shuttlecock. The hen observed
these antics with some interest but after 20 minutes or so, the wild cock
despaired of achieving anything and flew away. The performance was
repeated several times on subsequent days, then everything settled down
again and our pair resumed their normal existence.
Some time previously we had provided a hollow log. The barbets were
very interested in it and investigated it thoroughly but did not appear to
be using it to rear a family.

During the two or three weeks following the visit of the wild Barbet,
both our birds were active and visible throughout the day, though we
thought that one or both of them roosted inside the log at night.
Then one day we heard a quiet but unmistakable 'churring' sound
coming from the log. Both Barbets were visible as usual in the aviary and
obviously not responsible for the sound. When we fed them, the hen
disappeared into the hole with food in her beak. I caught a live cricket
and offered it and she took it, after a little hesitation, from my fingers
and delivered it to the nest hole.
Ten days later, a face appeared at the hole, looking out from inside
and a few hours later, we had three Barbets in our aviary, then four,
and five. The young were fully feathered and almost fully coloured, and,
apart from their short tails, were not much different from the parents.
The breeding season in Zimbabwe is not so precise as in Europe. If
food is plentiful the breeding season will be extended. During the 12 or
14 months that we kept this pair, they reared five families. Certainly
neither bird ever sat on eggs during the day, though almost certainly
they both stayed in the nest-hole at night.
When the chicks were being fed, I made a special effort to provide
live food which was obviously greatly appreciated. Once the chicks
were fledged the hen was no longer especially interested, certainly not
to the extent that she would take food from my fingers.
One day when I was gardening she clung to the wire and fixed me
with her beady little eye. I received the message, quickly pounced on a
live cricket, offered it to her and off she went to the nest hole. This early
evidence of hatching occurred four or five days before the 'churring'
became audible.
We never saw any evidence of the chicks' droppings. The parents were
never seen removing them from the nest and when I eventually dismantled
the nest hole, it was perfectly clean, so the sanitary arrangements remain
a mystery.
The Barbets were the most attractive and entertaining inhabitants of
our little aviary and despite being wild birds they settled down well.
They were always busy but were quite undistressed by confinement. Al-
though active, bold and inquisitive, they were not aggressive to other,
smaller birds. The hen, as I have described, very easily overcame the
barriers of species and language when she wished to communicate her
wishes to me. The cock bird fed the chicks too, but with less dedication
and he never took food from my fingers. Once, while proferring a rather
small insect to the hen, she accidentally gave me a painful nip and I
received a very real impression of the power of her beak. It felt as though
she could crack Brazil nuts if she wanted to.

One of the chicks had a much larger amount of red on its plumage
than the others. This raised in my mind the possibility of breeding colour
variations of this attractive bird but David disapproved strongly of
breeding 'abnormal' birds; to him the most attractive, in fact the only
acceptable colour pattern was that which was typical of the species, so
my little red chick was released to the wild as soon as he was considered
to be self-supporting.
There seems no reason why these attractive birds should not breed as
easily in Europe, provided that the aviary is heated, and it is recognised
that neither bird broods the eggs, at least during the day. Obviously,
mealworms would be appreciated while the chicks are being fed.
The quaintest birds I have ever kept were Red-faced Mousebirds or
Colies. I inherited a pair from a little girl who had brought them up from
about a week old. To say they were tame was the understatement of the
year. I released them once at a ladies' teaparty. The pair flew from hair
style to hairstyle, gently tweaking the curls. The tea was brought in, they
had dust baths in the sugar basin. Guessing what was to come next, I
warned my friends to cover their cups of hot tea with a hand or saucer.
As soon as it was cool enough the guards were removed and my two
Mousebirds dived in, like sparrows in the bird bath, balancing on the tea
cups, flirting their wings and fluffing their feathers, returning to the
hairstyles to dry out. My friends are very tolerant, and anyone who is
not likely to be fascinated and entertained by this performance has no
place in my circle.
This is the ideal household bird and so suitable as a child's pet.
Handled gently it will lie on its back in the palm of the hand and appears
to delight in human company. But nothing is perfect in this world. Their
favourite diet is soft fruit which in Zimbabwe means avocado, banana or
pawpaw. They will devour piles of these fruits and not more than 15
minutes later, it all appears again at the other end, still recognisable as
avocado, banana or pawpaw. So a period of abstinence of an hour or so
was necessary before demonstrating their teatime tricks. The cage needs
to be cleaned twice a day, the sodden newspapers make excellent com-
post. One day, when the pawpaw and avocados hung heavy on the trees,
I accidentally allowed the Mousebirds to escape. But they remain in my
memory as the most utterly tame and trusting of all the wild creatures
that have ever shared my life.

BRITISH SOFTBILL IMPORTS - SOME OBSERVATIONS
PARTI: CORVIDAE TO COEREBIDAE

(Hounslow, Middlesex)
During this last decade the numbers of foreign birds and species im-
ported into the UK has been drastically reduced. This is largely due to the
introduction of quarantine and the control of the numbers imported, and
has resulted in a much needed improvement in shipping and reception
standards. I believe that few aviculturists, if any, will regret the demise of
unrestricted bird importation. However, the last four to five years have
seen a welcome return of small numbers of species which were once fre-
quently available. These imports included a few species which have prob-
ably not been imported before, especially during 1985/86.
Softbill enthusiasts have taken advantage of these opportunities and
have added to the list of species bred in captivity.
For many reasons bird importations have always been erratic and
unpredictable. Currently some of the major factors affecting foreign bird
availability make a long list. Restrictions imposed by the importing coun-
tries, political, economic and agricultural conditions in the countries of
origin, the economics of civil aviation and the public perception of avi-
culture in the importing countries, to mention a few. Therefore, the
present availability of many species will probably be short lived. In addition
to 'first breedings' an opportunity now exists for the more frequently
imported species to be established in aviculture.
As demonstrated by articles in this magazine and in other avicultural
literature, there appears to have been an encouraging increase in the
number of successful breedings in recent years. These have included zos-
terops, bulbuls, starlings, barbets, babblers and tanagers, among the more
frequently imported bird families.
The following three part lists, are intended to give a limited indication
of some of the species imported in recent years. They are headed under
bird families, obviously with many omissions and I have followed a reversed
order of Clements Checklist (1981). Those species which have probably
not been imported before 1980 are identified by an asterisk. Reference

The African Piapiac Ptilostomus afer has seldom been seen in aviculture

From Fred Barnicoat (South Africa)
The South African National Cage Bird Association's National Show and
Conference for 1987 were held in East London in July. Over 500 indi-
genous and exotic birds were exhibited in addition to two and a half
thousand Canaries and Budgerigars. This exhibition was characterised by
the preponderance of the more easily kept and bred species, especially
the Australian finches, the Gouldians and Zebra Finches in the latest mu-
tant forms being of a particularly high standard. The Eastern Cape is a
stronghold of mule and hybrid breeding, but in this Show there was an
apparent dearth of parrot-like, soft-billed and the rarer and more unusual
species. Therefore the unusual situation arose in which the supreme award
went to a pair of Cut-throats of the nominate race Amadina f fasciata
from West Africa. They were particularly clear of markings on the upper
breast and the abdominal chestnut patch showed up well, so that they
contrasted nicely with our indigenous subspecies from further south,
Amadina f. meridionalis with its heavy scalloping and duller appearance,
seven examples of which were benched in the South African Bird Section.
The medal for the meritorious breeding of the year for 1987 was
awarded to E.A. Clewlow (Durban) for rearing two Grosbeak or Moluccan
Starlings Scissirostrum dubium. They nested in a budgerigar nest-box in
the aviary shelter, using leaves, straw and paper to construct the nest. Two
eggs, blue with brown spots, were laid. Both hatched and the chicks were
reared mainly on an almost unlimited supply of flying ants, collected
after rain, and refrigerated to ensure a continuous supply. Two subsequent
broods were lost, there being no supply of these flying ants available.
Other officially verified breedings included one Yellow-billed Hornbill
Lophoceres flavirostris , reared in a sisal stump, 5 the parents only partially
sealing the entrance with mud. The diet used was minced ox-heart, soaked
dog biscuit, crushed maize, sunflower seed and diced fresh fruit.
Two Knysna Louries (Touracos) Turacus corythaix were reared in a
nest that the parents built of pine needles and green grass shoots in a

shallow wooden tomato box. The feeding was similar to that used for the
Yellow-billed Hornbills above, excluding the ox heart and seeds.
Two Five-coloured or Chestnut and White Munias Lonchura quinti-
color were bred in a nest of grass woven in a clump of dry bush. The
parents fed on egg food, fruit flies and mealworms in addition to the usual
seeds. This species was first imported into South Africa in 1980 but has
proved generally rather wild in aviaries and not easily bred. However, in
addition to the above-mentioned success, they were also bred in Cape
Town in 1987. Other successes included two Grey-headed Munias Lon-
chura caniceps from south-eastern New Guinea, one Black-headed Siskin
Carduelis notatus - also reported breeding well in Cape Town, and one

Our records showed that when breeding, the incubation was shared by
both sexes in a pair of White-throated Canaries Serinus albogularis (Vol. 91
1985, No. 4, pp. 217-221). A second observation of the same pair by the
Avicultural Research Unit has revealed that the male would stand over the
eggs with drooped wings, but he was not observed to sit tight when the
female vacated the nest for short periods. Popular reference states that
Serinus species are only incubated by females. This behaviour may arise
from the fact that Streaky-headed Canaries S. gularis are known to peck
the eggs in exposed nests. Two pairs of these birds were housed in the
same aviary as the White-breasted Canaries.

Derek Goodwin writes that his last Blue-headed Cordon Bleu has died
at 13 years and four months old (calculated from fledging date, 25th Aug-
ust 1973 to 23rd December 1986). Is this a record?

releases. Although found only in the north and central regions of Mexico,
its former range included Arizona and New Mexico in the U.S A.
It seems that Taiwan. Is fast becoming an area of importance for avi-
culturists, ornithologists and protectionists alike. The export of endemic
species such as Steered Babbler Liodchla sfeerii , the Formosan Yuhina
Yuhina brunneiceps and Yellow Tit Pams holsti is causing concern as re-
duction in numbers is becoming more noticeable in certain areas.
Whatever branch of aviculture you specialise in, the Mandarin Duck
Abe galerimlata is a familiar bird.Rather surprisingly, this species is
now becoming a rare species in. its native China and Japan. The Chinese
population may be as low as 500, while that of Japan has decreased by
3,000 in the past four years and now stands at between 8-9,000. The feral
population in England is believed to be 850-1,000 pairs in 750 locations.
The California Condor Gymnogyps californiums is extinct in the wild.
The last free specimen was captured on 19th April 1987 to join the 26
others held in captivity at San Diego Wild Animal Park and Los Angeles
Zoo. The species has yet to breed in captivity but courtship behaviour has
been reported recently at San Diego Zoo.
The Spix's Macaw Cyanopsitta spbeii from eastern Brazil is one of the
world&amp;apos;s rarest birds but last year two young were taken from the only
known nest of this gravely endangered species whose wild population is
believed to be as low as six individuals. The illegally-taken young were
seized after undercover operations by members of several protection
organisations. The birds were destined for West Germany and were valued
at #13,000 each. Both are now housed in Sao Paulo Zoo,
The Diamond Fire tail Embleina guttata Is the most familiar of the
five members of this genus. Of the others, the Beautiful E. bella and Red-
eared E. oculata have not been seen in European aviaries in recent times,
although 20 of the latter were imported into Switzerland in 1970. In Aus-
tralian aviaries both are kept but not very commonly. Exact numbers are
difficult to state but as all indigenous birds have to be registered, it is
known that neither of the two are held in South Australia, In New
South Wales, five bella and 96 oculata are legally registered.
Since the rediscovery of the Gurney&amp;apos;s Pitta Pitta gumeyi in. Thai-
land, a further two males have been seen within the area of the original
sighting.

BIRDS. VOLUME I: SEED EATING BIRDS.
Compiled by Neville Brickell. Illustrated by Rex M. Shirley. Published by
Nadine Publishers, P.O. Box 83492, South Hills 2136, Republic of South
Africa. 1986, ISBN 0 620 09899 6. Twenty-three coloured plates, num-
erous black and white illustrations, maps, etc. Paperback. In the U.K.
available from Messrs. Wheldon and Wesley, Lytton Lodge, Codicote,
Hitchin, Herts., SG4 8TE.
Upon opening a book, invariably the first thing I do is look at the
pictures. This present book was no exception and, instead of the all too
usual selection of pictures of common seed-eaters, it was refreshing to
find good coloured photographs of several species with which I am largely
unfamiliar and, so I suspect, are many other members. I have in mind
particularly the coloured photographs of the recently-discovered Lemon-
breasted Canary, the Cape Siskin, Forest Canary, Pink-throated Twin-
spot, Cape and Cabanis' Buntings and the Damara Black-headed Canary,
a race of the rather better known nominate form, sometimes called the
Alario Finch.
There are coloured photographs of more familiar species, among them
the gorgeous Violet-eared Waxbill, Melba Finch and Blue Waxbill. Almost
without exception, the photographs are of a high standard. Most are the
work of Neville Brickell (whom members will know as a regular contribu-
tor to the Avicultural Magazine ); the remainder are by Stuart Shillinglaw.
In addition, there are numerous excellent black and white illustrations.
At first I was puzzled by their unusual photographic quality, until en-
quiries revealed that they were made from enlarged photographs, which
were touched-up with pen and brush by Rex Shirley, then specially
reduced down for reproduction in this book.
As well as the 23 coloured photographs inside, a male Taha Weaver
(Golden Bishop) in full breeding plumage adorns the front cover and a
fine portrait of a Black-eared Canary fills the entire back cover. In addition
to the birds, there are other illustrations and distribution maps.
Southern Africa is taken to be approximately the southern third
of that continent; it includes the Republic, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbab-
we and Mozambique. According to my reckoning, this present volume
covers 66 species, or 67 if, as in South Africa, Dufresne's and the Yellow-
bellied Waxbills (called in South Africa the Swee Waxbill and East African
Swee) are treated as separate species. Included are the typical Waxbills,
Pytilias, Firefinches, Twinspots, a Crimsonwing, a Seedcracker, Marini-

kins, Whydahs, Widow-birds, Weavers/Bishops (genus Euplectes ), Queleas
and Buntings.
Several pages are devoted to general care and in most instances there is
a page or slightly more of information about each species. Set out under
separate headings, this includes the Afrikaans name, alternative English
names, a description of the species and any southern African races, their
range there, details of each species' habitat, diet, then nesting, followed by
a sentence or two about their habits/behaviour, under the heading 'Beha-
vioural/Characteristics'.
The information about their diets pertains mainly to southern Africa.
Of wider interest is the information about nesting, giving as it does details
of the nests, eggs, incubation and nestling periods, etc. The information
regarding each species' habits/behaviour can in some instances help to
provide a better understanding of their aviary requirements.
Included in the final part of this book are lists of hybrids, places in
southern Africa of interest to bird-keepers (public collections, etc.), clubs
and associations and considerable detail about the laws relating to keeping
wild birds in the different parts of southern Africa.

THE PRESIDENT S GARDEN PARTY - 1987
On 6th September 1987, Avicultural Society members and their guests
assembled once again at Chestnut Lodge, Cobham, Surrey, to see the
collection of Miss Ruth Ezra and Mr. Raymond Sawyer. As Miss Ezra
was elected President of this Society last year, this annual event can now
be referred to as 'The President's Garden Party', as in the days when
members used to visit her father's collection at Foxwarren Park. (Mr. Al-
fred Ezra was President of the Society from 1926 until 1955).
One normally thinks of the Chestnut Lodge collection as bathed in
sunshine. However, on this occasion we had to shelter until the rain eased
off. While waiting, visitors were able to watch a dozen Caribbean Flamin-
gos wading, honking and quarrelling in the pond which they share with a
variety of waterfowl, including Hooded Mergansers, Baikal Teal, Eiders,
Pacific Brent and Red-breasted Geese. A Blonde Carolina drake in full
plumage gave some their first sight of this attractive mutation. On closer
inspection of the pond, a Red-eared Terrapin the size of a small frying

pan was seen to poke its head out of the water, apparently decide it was
not sunbathing weather, and retire again to the depths. On previous visits
a number of these animals had been in evidence, sunning themselves
around the edge of the water.
Eventually the rain stopped, and Mr. Sawyer conducted us round the
gardens. Crossing the lawn, we encountered Peruvian Thick-knees (a paler
and even wider-eyed edition of our native Stone Curlew), Oystercatchers,
East African Crowned and Demoiselle Cranes. A Golden Pheasant cock
added colour, and there was a family group of Buff Japanese Bantams -
apparently these are too short in the leg to scratch up flower beds.
At the far end of the main garden we were conducted into a paddock
containing Muntjac, white and normally coloured wallabies, in addition
to the egg-laying pair of Stanley Cranes. An aggressive single male Stanley
was in a further paddock, covered in netting, which was shared with
Indian Blue Peafowl and Welsummer fowls, leaving the wallabies, we
passed a block of aviaries housing Perfect Lorikeets, Stella's and Dusky
Lories. A group of Scarlet Ibis in immature plumage had been noted in
1986, and they were seen again now in full adult colour as we approached
the Gazelle Enclosure. The male Arabian Gazelle had been joined by a
female which at first appeared engagingly tame and friendly, letting herself
be stroked and petted by everyone. However, her interest in people was
later extended to creeping up and gently butting them from behind. A
female Arabian Gazelle has sharply pointed horns, and these attentions
were received with less enthusiasm. Also in this area were a pair of Maras
(Patagonian Cavies) with two young, pairs of Orinoco and Red-breasted
Geese, and another pair of Peruvian Thick-Knees. We were privileged to
meet the group of Aldabra Giant Tortoises, inside their heated house
where they were avoiding the English summer.
A range of aviaries in the above enclosure contained a magnificent
breeding pair of Green Junglefowl, White-collared Butan Mynas and the
Blackbird-sized South American Yellow Grosbeaks, with huge bills
appropriate to their enormous (for a 'finch') size. A pair of Blacksmith
Plovers seemed to be objecting to a cock Satyr Tragopan in the adjoining
aviary, while ignoring a hen Satyr and some Hill Partridges in their own
compartment.
Retracing our steps past the flamingos on our right and the breeding
group of Keas on our left, we came to the first waders' aviary, housing
Ruffs and a Redshank among others. A Virginian Cardinal was much in
evidence, and a Sun Bittern posed elegantly in a small pond.
Moving on to the walled garden, the first aviary held a species that has
only recently become available after an absence of several years, the Azure-
winged Magpie, here represented by a group with several fledged young.

Congo Peafowl occupied the aviary floor; though sometimes treated as
tropical house subjects, they always look very fit out of doors at Cobham.
The next aviary contained a pair of Grey-winged Trumpeters, one of which
was parading around with a large stick in its beak. The Violaceous Tour-
acos housed with them have again reared young this year.
A fine trio of Bearded Barbets was very active in the lofty outside
enclosure attached to the tortoise house, although most of the tropical
tortoises had remained indoors. Various sunbirds were in fine condition
though elusive in the well-planted tropical house. Smaller aviaries nearby
contained Cuban Finches (young reared this year), Golden Heart Doves
(sitting on eggs), Blue and White Flycatchers and the enchanting Black-
crested Jays, among others.
Our tour of inspection terminated in perhaps the most attractive part
of the grounds, at the rear of the house, where several large, well-planted
and watered aviaries are grouped around two formal ornamental ponds,
the latter containing large fancy Goldfish and Golden Orfe respectively.
Koi Carp were to be seen in one of the ponds in the aviary that houses one
of the gems of the collection, the pair of African Pygmy Geese. These ex-
quisite little waterfowl have been here for several years, and must be the
longest living pair ever in the U.K. Among birds sharing their accommoda-
tion were Turnstones, Egyptian Plovers, the old Scarlet Cock-of-the Rock
and a Quetzal. A flock of the most attractive Red-tailed Laughing Thrush
Garrulax milnei could be seen bathing in the waterfall at the back of this
enclosure which also contained Royal Starlings and Streaked Spider-
hunters.
In the main waders' aviary Avocets and Black-winged Stilts had again
reared young, as both species do annually. Emerald Starlings with young,
Pekin Robins and the large (Sumatran) race of the Silver-eared Mesia were
also in this aviary, in company with Indian Greenwinged Doves and some
very acrobatic Varied Tits. Jacanas trotted across the water lilies as they
do in Africa, whilst Avocets flew round calling before alighting to partake
of the mealworms dispensed by Mr Sawyer.
By this time the rain had started again as we made our way past more
Stella's Lories, Toco Toucans and White-crested Jay Thrushes from
Sumatra. Several Kookaburras, including two reared this year, greeted the
rain with peals of laughter as we were entertained to tea - in the house
rather than on the lawn, as in more clement years.

grateful for more donations and to hear from members whose collections
are open to the public and who would be willing to display one of these

Breeding Loan Agreement
The Foreign Bird Federation, to which the Avicultural Society is
affiliated, have prepared a Breeding Loan Agreement, which includes all the
essential points that need to be covered when a bird is loaned to another
aviculturist for breeding purposes. The form is printed in triplicate - one
part to be retained by the owner, one for the guardian and one to be sent
to the Foreign Bird Federation whose Council will act as arbitrator in the
event of a dispute, provided both parties agree to abide by its decision.
Avicultural Society Members may obtain copies of this form by applying
to Mr. R. Oxley, 2 Suttons Avenue, Hornchurch, Essex RM12 4LF.
Breeding Register
The Council has decided that, in view of the lack of response from
Avicultural Society members to the breeding register questionnaire that
has been circularised every year, as well as the lack of demand to buy the
results when published, the Society can no longer afford to conduct its
own survey. In future, Avicultural Society members are asked to send their
results to be collated by the Foreign Bird Federation and a questionnaire
is enclosed with this copy of the magazine. Members are strongly urged to
help make this survey as complete as possible, thereby presenting a strong
picture of the success of aviculture in this country. Strict confidentiality
will be observed for those members who signify that they wish to remain
anonymous. The Foreign Bird Federation have undertaken to send a
resume of the new Breeding Register, for publication in our magazine.

On one of the few fine days of this summer, in fact a heatwave, over
40 members and guests gathered for a buffet lunch at Warren Hill, the
headquarters of the Avicultural Society at Hartley Wintney, in Hampshire.
This was followed by a most interesting talk by Tony Tilford on 'Photo-
graphing Aviary Birds'. Mr. Tilford described all the various equipment
available that would be useful for this purpose and showed members how
to build or convert cages in which to photograph birds. The talk was
illustrated by many of Mr. Tilford's superb slides which amply confirmed
his reputation as one of the world's leading bird photographers who is in
great demand by publishers to illustrate bird books.

BREEDING THE GREAT HORNED OWL
Bubo virginianus
By IAN MARSHALL
(Norwich)
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.968413821428571" page_id="56240655"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
The Great Horned Owl is exclusively a New World species. This large
owl ranges from northern North America, where it spans the continent
between Alaska and Labrador, south to Tierra del Fuego, the Horn of
South America.
In common with its close relative, the Eurasian Eagle Owl Bubo bubo ,
the Great Horned Owl occurs as several geographical races. Howard and
Moore (1980) list 17 subspecies, occupying such diverse habitats as tropi-
cal rain forest, desert, tundra, plains, mountain areas and even parks in
large American cities!
Writing in 1893, A.K. Fisher, an American ornithologist, pleaded for
this magnificent owl's protection on the grounds that it represented one
of the farmer's greatest allies, consuming many rodents and rabbits. Unfor-
tunately, almost a century later L.W. Walker (1974) deplored the fact
that many U.S. states deny the Great Horned Owl legal protection and
consequently senseless shooting is causing a population decline.
On a happier note, W. and J. Salt (1976), stated that although casual-
ties occur on highways and power poles, legal protection is enjoyed in all
the Canadian states and as a result of the bird's tolerance of the proximity
of man and his environs, the future of the species seems assured.
My pair of Great Horned Owls are of Canadian stock and I should say
that they are of the subspecies known as the Tundra Horned Owl B.v.
wapacutha. This is one of the larger races with an overall greyish colora-
tion; W. and J. Salt exhibit a good photograph of the subspecies although
(such is the diversity of opinion as to exactly which race occurs where) the
caption supplied with the illustration gives the owl as B. v. subarcticus, the
Arctic Great Horned Owl, a race that is considered perfectly valid by some
authors but not even mentioned by Howard and Moore.
A Tundra Horned Owl would typically weigh between 3 Vi and 4 lbs.

Longevity for the species, in captivity, has been given as 29 and 38 years.
The Great Horned Owl is represented in at least 18 British zoos or
private aviaries, some of which have pairs from both North and South
America. Possibly there are as many as three or four dozen pairs in the
country. Owing to the fact that commercial bird dealers do not import
owls, some species in British aviculture are known to have descended from
but one original pair. In-breeding, with all its attendant ills, is therefore
inevitable for these types (although latterly moves by Avicultural Society
members have been initiated to help overcome this problem). Great Horned
Owls have been imported from at least three different localities in Texas,
Ontario and Vancouver, so some essential genetic diversity is available.
History of breeding pair
Both of my Great Horned Owls were obtained in 1986. First to arrive
was the female, bred at Paradise Park, Cornwall, in 1985. Mike Reynolds,
Curator of Paradise Park, informed me that the parent stock originated
from Vancouver Zoo, Canada, and that they had bred for 12 of the last
13 years.
The male owl was also captive-bred, by a breeder in S.E. England in
1982. I managed to trace the bird's history back as far as an Essex based
bird dealer but, although the dealer passed on a written request from me
to furnish details of the owl's history to the breeder, no further infor-
mation was forthcoming. I can only Hope that the birds are not too closely
related.
Although some display occurred during 1986, perhaps not surprisingly
owing to the young age of the female, no breeding was attempted.
Accommodation
When constructing aviaries for my owls, I find it convenient to use
fencing panels, of the overlapping type, commonly sold by garden sup-
liers. Using this method it is easy to extend an aviary by simply removing a
panel and adding extra space as required.
Accordingly, when I acquired my female owl in January 1986, the
aviary measured 12 ft long x 6 ft high x 6 ft wide (3.66 x 1.83 x 1.83 m).
Only the front section, measuring 6 ft x 6 ft (1.83 x 1.83 m) was wired
using 4 x 2 in (0.10 x 0.05 m) plastic coated 14G welded mesh. The
remaining sides and back were solid panels providing shelter and privacy
for the bird. The roof was of the same welded mesh covered with PVC
corrugated sheeting. When the male arrived in March 1986, I added a
6 x 3 ft (1.83 x 0.91 m) section to one of the sides of the aviary, at the
back, to provide a secluded alcove in which to construct a nest-site.
From the panel opposite the alcove extended another aviary, measuring

9 x 6 x 6 ft (2.74 x 1.83 x 1.83 m) in which was housed a pair of Bengal
Eagle Owls B. b. bengalensis.
Owing to a certain amount of aggression between the male and female
Great Horned Owls during 1986 I decided to part with the Bengals, take
out the panel partition and thus extend the aviary space available to the
Horned Owls to 18 x 12 x 6 ft (5.48 x 3.66 x 1.83 rn). The aviary was,
therefore, L-shaped and enclosed except for two 6 x 6 ft (1.83 x 1.83 m)
areas facing into the garden. A stout oak perch was placed approximately
3-4 ft (0.91 - 1.22 m) off the ground, at each end, and also at the bend of
the L-shape.
Two low, upright perches and a large log were also provided.
The male bird, smaller and less heavy than the female, customarily
flies from, one end to the other rounding the corner on the way. The
female rarely does this, preferring to fly only as far as the perch in the
corner of the L-shape. The male can thus escape the aggressive overtures
of his mate should the occasion demand it. Up to now, this arrangement
has worked well and I would not envisage keeping the species in any
smaller accommodation.
Diet
My Homed Owls receive a diet of laboratory rats and mice, also day-old
cockerels. Food is given in the evening, but if it is likely to freeze, food is
offered twice per day. A vitamin and mineral supplement is added to the
day-old chicks prior to and during the breeding and rearing season, a pinch
of the powder being considered sufficient for a day's supply of food.
Veterinary and hygiene notes
Up to now my Horned Owls have not needed veterinary attention ex-
cept, in the case of the female, for surgical sexing. As the female bird
arrived first, and was thought to be a male by the breeder, I am glad that
I had its sex surgically determined, especially as I was able to obtain a
mate some weeks later.
Hygienic measures include dusting possible hiding places for mites, such
as perches, with a pyre thrum based insecticide, and special attention is
given to the nest area. Peat is used as a floor covering in preference to leaf
mould which may harbour pests and diseases from wild birds.
Breeding
As wild Horned Owls like to appropriate old birds' nests, I thought I
would simulate this by using a wicker cat basket of approximately 24 in
(0.60 m) diameter. This was placed 3 ft (0.91 m) off the ground in an
enclosed alcove added onto the aviary for the purpose. An upturned turf

was placed in the bottom of the basket and peat added to fill the remain-
ing space. A stout, semi-circular elderberry branch was attached next to
the rim to protect the structure when the owl landed on the nest and to
provide a secure footing.
The female began to show an interest in the nest-site in January 1987,
flying over to it at dusk when the male began hooting. However, it was not
until early March that the female joined in the vocalisation so that at dusk
the birds would begin to duet; the male having a low four or- five syllable
hoot, the female a perceptibly higher pitched call of six or seven syllables.
Whilst duetting, the birds would face each other and bow low so that
the body was held on a horizontal axis, tail pointing skyward, ear tufts
raised and the brilliant white throat conspicuous in the dull light.
Ritual beak touching was observed, although the male always seemed
nervous of the larger female who would occasionally chase the male
around the aviary. No food passing between the male and the female
occurred, although the male did place a piece of rat in the empty nest-
basket on one or two occasions.
Mating was first observed in mid-March, taking place at dusk when
the female, standing on an upright log, solicited the male by hooting and
holding her body in the horizontal display posture. Duration of mating
on this and subsequent occasions was between five and seven seconds.
Two days after the first mating was observed the female owl began
digging a hollow scrape in the peat in the nest-basket, using the beak to
bulldoze the material from the centre of the nest to the periphery. Two
weeks of displaying, duetting, mating and chasing followed, the male
continuing to be very nervous of the female, until the end of March when
the female was observed to be sitting in the basket and the male acting
in a highly aggressive manner, clicking his beak loudly and flying at the
aviary netting when I approached. I should add here that I never enter
the aviary to feed the owls; food is 'posted' through a hole cut into one
of the panels at the back of the aviary and falls onto a flat stone placed
there for the purpose.
On 29th March one egg was seen in the nest when the female came
off for around five minutes to drink, duet and mate. A week later, looking
through one of several 'spy' holes drilled in strategic places, I saw two eggs
in the nest.
After the second egg was laid, no further mating was observed and
duetting ceased. The female was only seen to leave the nest for around
five minutes at dusk to drink, dust bathe, preen and feed (the male did
not take any food to the female on the nest, as may be expected with
other types of owl).
Thirty-two days after the first egg was laid, a faint cheeping was heard

in the nest and the female appeared to be unable to settle down. Jerking
movements of the body were observed and the nape and back feathers
were raised; presumably the movements of the chick underneath the
sitting bird were the cause.
At 7.00 p.m., a day after hatching, a hen-like clucking noise signalled
the fact that the female owl was feeding the chick. Rats, mice and day-old
chicks were available, the female choosing the latter to give to the chick,
breaking off small pieces to offer whilst 'clucking' to stimulate the chick
to feed. When the young owl had eaten sufficient food the female would
continue to offer choice morsels whilst 'clucking' in a louder, more in-
sistent manner, before consuming the remains of the meal herself.
Eleven days after hatching, the chick was seen preening and its second
down was coming in. Its eyes were opening and it seemed alert and strong.
A day later, at dusk, the female was observed hooting at and chasing
the male around. The next evening, for the first time, the male took food
to the sitting female. A surplus of mice and chicks began to accumulate in
the nest. Also, the unhatched egg was still present and I decided to remove
it in case it got broken and fouled the chick's plumage.
By instinct the chick lay flat and quiet in the nest as I removed the
unhatched, infertile egg. The adult owls flew to the far end of the aviary
and hooted loudly, but were apprehensive of the long-handled net that I
took in with me as a precaution.
At four weeks old the owlet was jumping around actively in the nest. It
was now covered with a thick buff-grey down, barred with darker brown.
It was observed standing upright holding a day-old chick with the foot,
breaking it up and eating much as an adult would. The nest was kept rela-
tively clean by the chick walking backwards to the nest rim to mute (void
the faeces) over the edge.
After six weeks the owlet left the nest. Although it had proved capable
of feeding itself, it continued to rely on the female to bring it food. On
two occasions, however, the male was seen to take food direct to the owlet;
previously any food offered by the male had been accepted by the female
who would then feed the owlet.
A month after leaving the nest, the owlet was no longer fed by the
adults; wing and tail feathers were well grown although downy feathers
were still present on head, back and breast. Feet and talons were almost
as large as those of the adult male; eye colour was a similar pale yellow.
The owlet was now eating day-old chicks and rat. Interestingly, in its 11 th
week, the male on offering the owlet a day-old chick was rewarded with a
sharp peck. Seemingly the young owl regarded itself as self-sufficient as
far as food was concerned and resented the attention of its parent.
During the ensuing month the owlet lost its remaining downy plumage

until, by the second week in August, approximately four months after
hatching, it could only be distinguished from the adult male by an area of
pale down on top of its head and its shorter 'ear' tufts. In order to avoid
any future confusion over which bird was which, the young Great Horned
Owl was removed from the aviary and placed with a local breeder.

BREEDING THE JAPANESE WHITE-EYE
Zosterops japonica
By JEFFREY TROLLOPE
(Hounslow, Middlesex)

<bodyText confidence="0.960503615384615" page_id="56240660"  page_num="190" year="" vol="">
The family Zosteropidae consists of a homogenous group of some 85
Old World species. The most frequently imported is the Oriental White-eye
Z. palperbrosa, closely followed by the African Yellow White-eye Z. sene-
galensis, and the Asiatic Chestnut-flanked Z. erythropleura.
Considering their regular availability, successful breeding results have
been comparatively few. The sexes are alike throughout the family and it
would appear that any possible sexual dimorphism, e.g. the hen duller, is
masked by sub-specific or clinal differences. Recently small numbers of
the Japanese White-eye Z. japonica have been imported and I purchased
what I hoped was a possible pair in November 1986.

Food and housing
During the winter of 1986/87 the birds were housed in an outside bird
room, maintained at a temperature range of 45-55*F (8-12*C) and an ex-
tended day provided by electric light until 20:00 hours. Their basic diet
consists of Claus softbill mixtures, both fine grade and coarse, which the
White-eyes break up and eat without difficulty. Bio-nectar, cut oranges
and apples are provided twice a week, buffalo worms and small mealworms
are given ad-lib. In April 1987 the Japanese White-eyes were released into
an aviary measuring 3.1 x 1.1 x 2.4 m high (10 x 314 x 8 ft). They were
housed with a pair of Chestnut-throated Seedeaters Sporophila telasco and
three Chestnut-flanked White-eyes of indeterminate sex.

Breeding
The birds were identified by coloured leg rings, yellow and blue. During
April 1987 the bird with the yellow ring was observed singing frequently.
On 20th May both birds were carrying upholsterer's fibres and dog's hair
into a waxbill-type domed basket, about 1.06 m (3 Vi ft) high. A neat cup
nest was completed by the 21st and the first of three pale blue eggs (poin-
ted at the small end) was laid on the 23rd. Both birds visited the nest
frequently prior to incubation, which started when the third egg was laid
on the 25th. It was difficult to ascertain the pattern of sharing incubation
between the sexes,but it appeared that the male (yellow ring) would sit
from about 08:00 to 11:00 hours, and 16:00 to 18:00 hours, though
there were frequent brief change-overs, when the female came off the nest
to feed. Both birds sat very tight, not leaving the nest even when I looked
into the basket. During the change-overs, the bird arriving would carry a
fibre or dog's hair into the nest. On 7th June, the birds deserted and the
eggs were found to be infertile.
On 16th June the birds started building a second nest. This was comple-
ted two days later, a deep cup beautifully constructed of dog's hairs, fibres
and a few feathers. The nest was suspended between three thin, vertical
twigs in a clump of cut conifer, fixed to the side panel of the aviary, about
the same height as the first nest. On the 19th the first of three eggs was
laid and incubation started on the 21st, following a similar pattern to the
first breeding attempt. On 2nd July two chicks hatched; their skin was
light flesh colour, the mouth reddish pink and their gape flanges very pale
yellow. Their diet was supplemented by invertebrates collected daily from
nettle beds, and fruit flies Dropsophila.
The parents brooded the chicks in turn, with frequent visits to the nest
with food. The chicks left the nest on 13th July; their bills were light
flesh colour, yellowish-white at the gape, the upperparts light olive, the
underparts greyish white, the feet were light flesh colour. At this stage
they lacked the adult's ring of silky-white feathers around each eye. Their
tails were short but they could fly quite well on leaving the nest. They
were fed by both parents, soliciting food with shivering wings and hunger
calls seep-seep. By 24th July, the chicks were feeding themselves although
soliciting food successfully from their parents. They were now showing
white eye rings, their bills were grey at the tips, the chin and throat yellow
and the upperparts darker olive, their legs and feet light grey.
The chicks were totally independent of the adults by 2nd August; they
had full tails and their plumage was very similar to the adults, although
somewhat duller. At the time of writing (14th September) the young have
been separated from their parents, who are incubating a third clutch of
three eggs.

Behaviour
Before and during the breeding the adult Japanese White-eyes were
dominant to the birds housed with them. When they alighted on a feeding
platform, other birds would move away or fly off as they approached.
When the chicks left the nest, the parents would chase away any bird
approaching them. During the day and at dusk, the parents and chicks
would often &amp;apos;clump' together in close contact and alio (mutual) preen.
Apart from the foods offered on the feeding platform, both parents and
young would glean live food from Convolvulus leaves growing on the aviary
sides. They would also hawk flying insects and, less often, forage on the
ground among plant litter.

BREEDING THE RED-BELLIED MACAW
Ara manilata
AT LORO PARQUE
By ROSEMARY LOW

(Tenerife, Spain)
The Red-bellied is a distinctive small Macaw about 20 in (50 cm) in
length. Most macaws have part of the lores feathered but the totally bare
lores and yellow facial skin distinguishes manilata from all others. This
species is mainly green, with blue on head and wings and a maroon patch
on the lower abdomen. Undersides of tail and flight feathers are olive
yellow. The bill is black and the iris is dark brown.
It occurs throughout most of the Amazon basin, its distribution coin-
ciding with that of Mauri tia palms on which it feeds. Common in the wild,
it is rare in captivity, although quite a few have been exported from
Guyana in recent years.
I believe that the most suitable environment for captive birds is an
outdoor aviary in a warm climate and a spacious indoor aviary in a cooler
climate. A small cage should not be considered.
At Loro Parque the Red-bellied Macaw was represented by a pair in
the off-exhibit breeding centre and by two males on exhibit, when I
became Curator in February 1987. The pair had been in residence for at
least four years without attempting to breed. This is not an easy subject
in captivity, being extremely susceptible to stress, also to obesity. Few of
the wild-caught birds which aviculturists obtain survive for more than two
years, unlike other Ara species which adapt very well to captivity.
I know of only two breeding successes prior to 1987, that of Florida
veterinarian Greg Harrison and, in the UK, that of the pair belonging to
Mrs. P. Vahrman. Her breeding of this species was the result of careful
thought and of knowledge of manilata in Guyana where she formerly
resided. I have the greatest admiration for the way in which she set up a
planted house and made her pair search for their food.
The pair at Loro Parque is housed In an aviary of traditional type,
measuring about 13 ft long x 3 Vi ft wide x 7 ft high (4 x 1 x 2.1 m). The
nest-box is attached to the outside of the aviary, thus inspection presents
no problems. Not that these birds are aggressive like other macaws when
breeding; they remained quite shy. The nest-box measures 12 in x 13 in
x 30 in high (0.31 x 0.33 x 0.76 m); there is a 5 in (0.10 m) square inspec-
tion door near the bottom.
The female laid a clutch of four eggs in April; there were two eggs on

Red-bellied Macaw, aged 28 days, at Loro Parque
7th April. On 22nd April one egg was placed in an incubator as a precaution
against some catastrophe in the nest. Assuming it was the first egg laid (the
third was infertile), the incubation period was 25 days. It hatched in the
incubator at 5 p.m. on 30th April, and was transferred at 7 p.m. to the
nest of a pair of Illiger's Macaws Ara maracana which were known to be
excellent parents. They had two chicks, about two and three days old, and
immediately accepted the manilata chick.
The next day, 1st May, there was a pip mark on another manilata egg
which was removed to the incubator. The chick hatched on 3rd May and
it, too, was transferred to the Illiger's nest. Their eldest chick was taken
for hand-rearing, also an egg which hatched later that day. Both these were
successfully hand-reared. The third manilata egg pipped and hatched in the
incubator on 7th May. It weighed 13.2 g.
I made the wrong decision that this one should be hand-reared. It
appeared to be progressing well and I was shocked to find it dead at
6.30 a.m. on the fifth day. Autopsy did not reveal the cause of death; its
liver was normal but its kidneys appeared abnormal.
The two chicks with the Illiger's Macaws thrived; their crops were

always well filled. They were ringed at 19 and 21 days of age with 10 mm
rings. The elder chick left the nest on 17th July, aged 78 days, and the
second on 19th July, aged 77 days. They then differed from the adults
in the generally slightly duller plumage, very pale yellowish skin on the
face (ochre-yellow in adults) and in having the beak only partly black,
there being a broad light stripe down the centre of the upper mandible.
Development of the chicks was as follows:
Day 1 - fairly long yellowish down on upperparts and head; down
shorter and more whitish on underparts. The beak was whitish and the
nails white.
Day 19 - eyes open; ears just open; beak pinkish-white. Head bare,
almost wrinkled skin. No feathers erupted but prominent dark lines
under the skin, especially on the back (second down). A little short
whitish down remained on the back and nape. Tail quills present; wing
feathers in quills 1.2 cm to 2.5 cm long.
Day 26 - soft pads on sides of beak dark; beak otherwise white, tinged
with grey. Head almost bare. Sparse tufts of grey second down on the
back; wing feathers erupting.
Day 40 - wings nearly fully feathered; back and sides of neck bare,
crop and underparts virtually bare.
Day 46 - head and wings three-quarters feathered.
Day 49 - head bluish; almost completely feathered. Bare skin on face
white. Beak white, grey at base of upper mandible and on the raised pads.
Feet and nails grey.
The two young manilata and their maracana companion were removed
to a suspended cage on 10th August. After the first day, when they ate
very little in the new surroundings, they consumed corn-on-the-cob with
enthusiasm, also the standard mixed food. This consists of soaked or
sprouted sunflower, boiled maize, sprouted mung beans and a couple of
other types of boiled beans, peanuts in the shell, boiled peanut kernels,
apple, carrot and alselgar (similar to spinach but with a larger leaf). Other
fruits in season, such as cactus, pear and palm fruits, are offered. The
chicks were reared on this food, plus bread and milk.
After the removal of their eggs at the beginning of May, the female
Red-bellied Macaw produced a second clutch of three eggs, one of which
(probably the last) was infertile. The first egg was laid on 1st June and
there were two chicks by 27th June, again giving an incubation period of
25 days.
The chicks were very well cared for by the parents. Unlike those
reared by the Illiger&amp;apos;s, when disturbed for nest inspection or to change
the wood shavings, they would roll on to their backs with their feet in
the air in the typical macaw defensive position. They were ringed when

26 days old with 11 mm rings. The young were always a joy to hold - so
plump and sweet-smelling. They left the nest for the first time on 8th
September but for the next few days spent much of the time inside the
nest.
Parent-reared macaws are, in my limited experience, much heavier
than those reared by hand and I was pleased that with this important
species four chicks were reared by this method in 1987. In many groups
of parrots hand-reared young are equal or superior to those reared by
their parents but this has not been my experience with macaws at Loro
Parque this year.
The young will be retained for breeding purposes. Fewer problems
should be experienced with captive-bred birds, which may be the main
hope of establishing the Red-bellied Macaw in aviculture.
Finally, 1 would like to acknowledge the excellent keepers who were
involved with the rearing of this species at Loro Parque.

BREEDING TWO SPECIES OF BROTOGERIS PARRAKEETS
AT LORO PARQUE

The small neotropical parrakeets of the genus Brotogeris are not well
represented in collections. At Loro Parque six of the seven species are
kept. The two pairs of tirica are off exhibit at the time of writing (one
pair is to be placed on exhibit) and the Orange-chinned Parrakeet B. jug-
ularis is not present in the collection.
Members of the genus are notorious for failing to breed in captivity.
However, Robbie Harris, a private aviculturist in California, has bred six
species (she does not have tirica) and is perhaps the only person to have
achieved real success.
Her cages are small, as are those at Loro Parque. The latter measure
approximately 58 in (1.5 m) long, 32 in (0.82 m) wide and 40 in (1.02 m)
high., and are suspended about 3 ft (0.91 m) off the ground. No Broto-
geris had been reared here until this year, I believe. I am thus pleased to
report success with two species.
The Cobalt-winged Parrakeet Brotogeris cyanoptera has very seldom
been bred in captivity. It originates from the western part of the Amazon
basin. There is one pair of the nominate race on exhibit and three speci-
mens, also of the nominate race, off exhibit. The latter are so much more
brightly coloured that I believed that those on exhibit must have been
either gustavi or beniensis until the German aviculturist Thomas Arndt
assured me that they were not. None answers precisely to the descrip-
tions given by Forshaw ( Parrots of the World , 1971) for example. In
August 1987 Carlos Keller, an extremely knowledgeable Brazilian avi-
culturist, visited Loro Parque and told me that the more brightly coloured
birds originate from Acre, in Brazil. They are much brighter yellow on
the forehead, the yellow being more extensive in the believed males
which have the crown tinged with blue.
It is regrettable that because of the difficulty of inspecting the nests
in the range of cages for the Brotogeris parrakeets, I can provide no infor-
mation on the development of the chick of the pair on exhibit. The nest-
box for this pair is very small, measuring about 4 in x 5 in x 10 in high
(0.10 x 0.12 x 0.25 m), of a sloping design. The first of three eggs was
laid about 20th April and hatched on about 14th May. The young bird
left the nest on 2nd July, i.e. after about 49 days. It was very confident
and a joy to watch with its very attentive parents.

On fledging it differed from them in its much smaller beak, also in the
beak coloration, the upper mandible being dark brown, except the fleshy
pads at each side. The feet were grey, not pink tinged with grey as in the
adults. The orange spot on the chin was as bright and as extensive as in
the adults. The lores, also a very small area of the forehead, were tinged
with yellow. There was a faint blue tinge on the head and a little yellow
on the carpal edge of the wing. The cere was white.
Incidentally, the male parent has a larger head and beak but plumage
does not differ in male and female.
The bond between the three birds is very close; they are never more
than a few inches apart, usually with the young one in the middle. It will
frequently take hold playfully of the upper mandible of one of its parents
but apparently not in a serious attempt to solicit food. Mutual preening
between parents and young, including vent-preening, is frequently observed.
According to Forshaw, the call of this species is undescribed. It emits a
Budgerigar-like chirruping, also squawking similar to that species, but not
as loud.
The three other cyanoptera at Loro Parque were caged two and one
without a nest-box until late May when a cage in the second breeding
centre (just constructed) was available for them. The three birds were
then housed together, sexes unknown. Believed to be two males and one
female, they were immediately compatible. During the third week in July
the female started to lay. There were four eggs by 31st July but these
proved to be infertile.
In the next cage to the cyanoptera on exhibit are a pair of Orange-
flanked or Grey-cheeked Parrakeets B. pyrrhopterus which had laid
clutches of six in 1985 and five in 1986. Two eggs of each clutch were
fertile and chicks hatched but these apparently died after being removed
for hand-rearing in 1985 and when left with the parents in 1986.
In 1987 the female had laid four eggs by 7th April. Two chicks hatched,
the first on 22nd April, They were removed for hand-rearing on 1st May
when they weighed 29.2 and 31.Sg, On that day they were ringed with
6 mm rings (the cyanoptera was ringed when about 14 days old but the
ring came off). Weights were as follows: 5th May, 33.7g and 34.3g; 12th
May, 36.4g and 37.4g; 19th May, 43.2g and 45.4g; 26th May, 55.Ig and
57.2g; 2nd June 61,2g and 65.8g; 9th June, 59.5 g and 68.0g, The 16th
June was the first day on which they commenced to lose weight; they
then weighed 53.8g and 64.8g and were still feeding well from the spoon.
Favourite foods when they started to eat were spray millet and corn*ou-
tlie cob.
On 22nd June they weighed 53.8 g and 60.8g. The next day they were
removed from the hand-rearing room and four days later to a suspended

cage outdoors. They ate corn cobs ravenously and these were offered for
the next month. By then they were eating the standard food well. This
consists of parrakeet mixture (canary, millet, groats and sunflower plus
chopped apple, carrot, alselgar (similar to spinach but with a larger leaf)
and peas.
They were enchanting little creatures at weaning stage, similar to the
parents except for the bill which is dark brown with the soft pad white.
This bill colour gives them a more gentle appearance than the adults. The
only other difference is in the darker colour of the feet of the immature
birds - grey rather than pink.
The hand-rearing food consisted of the following blended with mineral
water: wheat germ cereal, baby cereal such as Nestles Seven Cereals, Three
Fruits or Multifrutas, oatmeal, a little carrot, apple and alfalfa, a small
amount of soaked mung beans, soya flour and a few drops of Dayaminerals
(Abbott Laboratories SA, Madrid), occasionally peanut butter and a little
calcium.
As already noted, the chicks from the first clutch were removed for
hand-rearing on 1st May. A second clutch, consisting of five eggs, was laid
at the beginning of June. By 3rd July four chicks had hatched; the fifth
hatched two days later.
The two older chicks were removed for hand-rearing on 10th July. The
nest-box was of the same dimensions as that described for the Cobalt-
winged Parrakeets; it was simply too small to hold five chicks. On that day
they were ringed with 6 mm rings. The third and fourth chicks were ringed
on 14th July and the fifth two days later.
The parents made an excellent job of rearing the three young. The first
two left the nest on 12th August but for two or three days spent most of
the time back in the nest. The third chick left on 15th August. The beha-
viour of the family was identical to that of the cyanoptera ; from very soon
after fledging the young would preen their parents as enthusiastically as
their parents preened them. They quickly learned to feed on their own.
Meanwhile, one of the two chicks from the second nest which was
being hand-reared developed unusual markings. Each feather of the flanks
and the sides of the upper breast had a bar of orange near the tip of the
feather, producing a very attractive barred effect.
These two chicks weighed 31.9 g and 33.9 g when removed from the
nest on 10th July. Subsequent weights were as follows (in grams): 16th
July, 39.7 and 37.1; 23rd July, 41.2 and 37.1; 30th July, 52.0 and 49.7;
6th August, 64.8 and 62.1. The 10th August was the first day on which
they lost weight: 64.8 g and 65.1 g. On 13th August they weighed 64.6 g
and 61.6 g and on 20th August, 64.9 g and 61.6 g. They were removed
from the hand-rearing room, weaned and on 26th August weighed 58.3 g

and 58.7 g. Again, the favourite food was corn-on-the-cob and spray millet.
I am especially pleased that the pair at Loro Parque produced seven
young in 1987. The Orange-flanked Parrakeet has a limited range in north-
western Peru and south-western Ecuador. Certainly in Ecuador its numbers
have declined considerably in recent years due to the combined pressures
of habitat destruction and excessive trapping.
In the 1970s this species was exported in quite large numbers. Tame
young birds could be obtained for extremely low prices. Then Ecuador
and Peru prohibited the commercial export of their fauna and this species
became virtually unobtainable. Breeding successes were almost non-existent.
In 1979 or thereabouts Peru again allowed the export of birds and enor-
mous numbers of pyrrhopterus were imported into the USA. Between
October 1979 and June 1980, for example, over 7,500 were imported
into the States; very much smaller numbers reached Europe.
This delightful little parrakeet is now fairly rare and seldom bred in
Europe. As a threatened species, it deserves more attention from avicul-
turists. It is in danger of dying out in captivity and of becoming rare in
the wild.
My aim is to have several breeding pairs at Loro Parque. I would like
to hear from other breeders who would be willing to exchange young to
form unrelated pairs. And may I urge anyone who has a single bird to
make an effort to ensure that it has the opportunity to breed. Success
will bring so much more pleasure than a single pet bird.

Have you ever wondered what the name of a species signifies? For me,
etymology or the definition of words is a curiosity; I often page through
ancient journals just to learn the meaning of a word. Often there is an
interesting history. A case in point is Cacatua , the name given to the white
cockatoos.
Cacatua is derived from the French kakatoes , said to have been derived
from the Malay kakatua - an onomatopoeic word.
This group of birds has the plumage invariably white or pinkish, greyish
if one wishes to include the Gal ah or Rose-breasted Eolophus roseicapilla
in the genus Cacatua. All have crests, this being greatly developed in the
Moluccan or, as I feel they should be called, Salmon-crestedC moiuccensis ,
and virtually absent in the Goffm's C goffini. Almost invariably, the crest
is raised when startled, when threatening or during the breeding display; at
other times it is held against the crown.
Cockatoos also 'hiss' and often stomp one foot against the perch; both
of these displays are used to scare intruders or to threaten.
The breeding display usually consists of opening the wings, screeching,
fanning the tail, and making various movements; in the case of the Sul-
phur-crested C galerita , the head is moved in an imaginary figure eight.
In the wild, as I have seen at first hand, males sometimes chase their mates
wildly through the trees. All the while, aerial acrobatics are used.
In their native habitat, the females can flee from overly aggressive males,
whose driving can turn vicious. In captivity, however, the birds are im-
prisoned together; an exceedingly cantankerous male in a fit of anger -
these personality changes, from a lovable to a blood-thirsty bird, can
occur on a pinhead and usually without warning - can often succeed in
maiming or killing his mate.
I have known of long-term proven pairs that were very devoted to each
other. Suddenly and without any warning, the male viciously turned on his
mate. In one case, her neck was broken; in another, the breeder found the
male chewing on the leg of his mate. Her body, mutilated beyond recog-
nition, was in the nest.
It appears that Moluccan, Australian Sulphur-cresteds C galerita ,
Major Mitchell's or, as most Americans call them, Leadbeater's C lead-
beateri and the sulphurea group are the worst offenders.
Before an attack, there is usually a change in the aviary or nearby. In

one case in my collection a female, with which the male had been paired
previously, escaped; they had been separated because he is a very large
bird and she is a small, deeply coloured individual. Immediately, the male
recognised the smaller hen, to which he had always been attracted, and
started to display. Without warning, he attacked the hen with which he
had been housed. Had I not been in the room at the time, she surely
would have been killed.
There are ways of reducing the risk of a male injuring his mate. During
the breeding season, his wings should be clipped; I prefer clipping the
flight feathers on one wing, thereby permanently grounding him. Also,
with the aggressive species, 1 suggest housing them in extensive aviaries,
so as to reduce the chances of the male having easy access to his mate.
A New Zealander told me several years ago that unless he kept his
galerita in 20 ft (6.10 m) long aviaries, the males invariably killed their
mates. Not all of us can afford to have such extensive enclosures, but 1
would suggest that at minimum a 12 ft (3.65 m) long enclosure should
be used.
At Havana Zoo, Cuba, this same species has proved problematic - the
males have killed their mates in the nest. To circumvent this, all nests
have more than one opening, permitting the hen to flee should a mad-
dened male enter.
I point all of this out not to scare a potential cockatoo breeder, but
so that one can be ever watchful. Moreover, so that the appropriate steps
be taken to circumvent any losses. Indeed, never has the loss of a hen
prevented me from trying to breed this fascinating group, which reigns
supreme in my collection. What I do is to urge birds to pair naturally -
this was the dictum after the aforementioned incident with the Moluc-
cans - and to watch for any ruffled feathers, aggressive acts and hens
that stay on the floor of their enclosures, where they have been banished
by their splenetic mates.
My cockatoos are housed in enclosures according to size. The larger
species have longer flights, the smaller are given less space. However, after
several years of experimentation, I am convinced that extensive enclosures
are neither imperative to fertility nor breeding. As an illustration, a pair of
Bare-eyed or Short-billed Corellas Cacatua sanguined in my possession
produced young while only two years old in an enclosure 30 in (0.76 m)
long.
Over the years, we have learned quite a bit about nest preferences.
Initially we used very large metal rubbish bins, but these were not entered
readily; the birds often perched at the entrance, opened their wings and
screamed. After examining several nests in the Australian outback, I
realised that they were just too large - smaller nests were in order.

We now use small metal drums for the larger species, and stainless
steel nests 24 in (0.61 m) deep and 12 in (0.30 m) square for medium-
sized species (e.g. Citron-cresteds). All of these have an inspection door.
Despite the shinyness, the birds seem to take to them very readily.
After examining nests in Australia and other parts of the world, I
have realised that large nests are rarely used; sometimes the parrots will
select an inferior site next door, just because its dimensions are smaller.
Security is inherent in smaller orifices.
We do not add the usual shavings to the nest, but force our pairs to
work and create their own. Each nest has several pieces of rotted wood
inside. As the hens chew, the males become interested and assist, thereby
strengthening the pair bond. Moreover, the darkness of the cavity stimu-
lates the gonadal development.
Perches are invariably made from wood - not pvc pipes, which are
difficult to grip or, if roughened, can wear the foot pads. I have stated
many times before that if a breeder cannot take the time to replace the
perches on a regular basis and is intent on using pvc or metal, he/she
should not keep birds at all, for this shows a lucid lack of consideration.
The diet used in my collection is being used widely across the US, after
we showed its effectiveness. In the morning the birds receive sprouted
seeds, fruits and vegetables, and occasionally wheat bread, dog or cat
chow and corn-on-the-cob. The seeds constitute 50% or less of this feeding.
Variety is the key. We use sunflower and safflower one week; corn,
safflower and par rake et seeds (minus hulled oats, which ferment very
quickly) the next; and soya beans, corn and sunflower the ensuing. The
idea is to vary the diet. Similarly, we alternate the vegetables and fruits
from week to week. The morning that this article is being written, they
are receiving broccoli, apple, cantaloupe, carrot and eggplant. Next week,
we will replace some of these with cauliflower, cabbage, beets, oranges
and others.
After spending considerable time in the field studying wild parrots,
I have become convinced of the importance of variability. Wild parrots
often forage on one food, then drop it for another. They rarely take dry
seeds when seeds in the milky stage are available, hence the reason for
using germinating grains.
Occasionally, during the coldest days of winter, we add some dry seeds
to the mix. This is done for the oil content, which will help generate more
heat.
The birds are not given a bowl full daily, but enough so that most of
the food has been consumed by noon. At dinner time, they are again fed -
cooked foods, meat, fish, poultry, pasta, etc. The stipulation is that nothing
excessively greasy or spicy is used - anything else can be and is given.

The feeding of restricted amounts and offering food twice daily is done
to replicate the wild, where parrots forage in the morning and again after
the hottest midday hours. Wild parrots never become excessively over-
weight, so it is for this reason that we restrict food availability. Overall, my
experience has been that parrots slightly on the thin side produce fertile
eggs and are much more willing to nest than those that are overly plump.
Nesting pairs or pairs with young receive more food.
We do little in regard to lighting or temperature to stimulate nesting.
This seems to come naturally. Traditionally, most pairs start nesting in
April, though isolated couples nest all the year round.
All cockatoos' eggs are white. They hatch around 28 days, though this
can vary slightly. Chicks are born covered in yellow down, varying in
amount from a thin wispy covering in Goffln's to a thick, brighter yellow
in Citron-cresteds. Their ears are open from birth and the soft bulbous
swellings so prominent in macaws, for example, are absent; instead, these
birds have a gap, which the parents grab during the pumping action.
The following notes illustrate the growth of one young Goffin's
Cockatoo.
1.9.1986: Newly hatched; weight 12.8 g; yellow down, lighter than in
the Citron and slightly sparser than in sanguined.
13.9.1986: 66.3 g: eyes open; head larger than in sanguined.
17.9.1986: 131.0 g; all pin feathers emerging; feet grey; small crop -
the smallest of all cockatoos reared to date; very quiet.
25.9.1986: 205.9 g; porcupine-like in appearance; decidedly Goffin-
like in appearance.
7.10.1986: 250.8 g; tail 38 mm long; fully feathered.
21.10.1986: 265.0 g; tail 38 mm long; fully feathered.
29.10,1986: 242.5 g; tail 50 mm long; weaning.
16.11.1986: Weaned.
Chicks resemble adults on weaning, with slight variation. In Sulphur-
cresteds a few greyish feathers are often present on forehead; in Goffin's
the crest is slightly longer; in Bare-eyeds the periophthalmic ring, cover-
ing a large area and deep purple in adults, is lighter and smaller, hence
giving some semblance to Goffin's; and in the Lesser Sulphur-cresteds
the mandibles are white. Interestingly, in the Citron-crested (treated by
most authors as a subspecies of the Lesser), the mandibles darken from a
young age. This and other characters lead me to believe that it should be
treated as a separate species.
During weaning, the Bare-eyeds become very thin, until they finally
start feeding themselves. Citron-cresteds prove problematic partway
through development, when they become difficult to feed; once fully
feathered, however, they are no longer a major problem.

Over the years we have managed to breed Coffin's, Triton, Medium
Sulphur-cresteds, Umbrella, Moluccan, Citron-cresteds, Bare-eyeds and
Lessers. We are currently concentrating our efforts on Australian Sulphur-
cresteds and Red-venteds.
During this time we have managed to rear some considerable numbers.
For example, in one year alone we hatched 11 Bare-eyeds. Of these, nine
reached independence; the two that died did so from a change in the diet -
a change that brought the level of protein in the formula up slightly. This
was not tolerated by the young. Every year, the aforementioned species
nest; more than one pair of each usually produces young.
In the course of our work we have noted some interesting points. In
many cockatoos hens about to lay produce very dark droppings; they
also seem to stop eating the day prior to egg-laying. Major problems have
been averted with Moluccans by removing the males after each clutch. He
is then moved into a separate cage, and a rotating male given to the hen.
We find that by moving them we increase fertility - a problem that plagues
every breeder of this impressive species - and reduce the chances of attack,
as he never really has a chance to become very 'chummy' with the hen. Also,
because he is introduced into her territory, the female remains dominant
for a while.
Again with the Moluccan, we offer to some of our pairs nests that are
almost horizontal. This prevents pairs that often become very nervous
when eggs or young are present from literally flying into the nest on sight
of their keeper. As the box hangs at a slight angle, the eggs are always laid
at the lowest end, the end opposite the entrance.
We have concentrated our efforts here on a few genera, among them
cockatoos. Many will wonder why. The reason for this is that greater
knowledge will be gained from a group as opposed to a Noah's ark type
collection; secondly, we can provide a number of young yearly to the pet
trade, thereby reducing pressures on wild populations and we offer many
individuals the chances of owning a hand-reared young; thirdly, the
reliability of the cockatoos nesting each year generates the income needed
to maintain the more difficult species and allows us to continue with the
research we are carrying out on parrots in the wild. Besides, they are one
of my favourite groups.
If you are looking for a group of birds that meets any of the above
criteria, may I suggest cockatoos. They will not disappoint you!

Reminiscences of a Wandering Aviculturist
By ROBIN L. RESTALL
(London)
In 1974 my company transferred me from Spain where I'd been living
for the previous four years to Venezuela. My peripatetic life had begun
much earlier when I went to live in Switzerland in 1947. A little later, five
years in the RAF took me to Germany and Cyprus, and a career with an
American advertising agency which began in London, went on to Denmark
and Norway, then to Spain. I was very much the European.
I had been keeping birds for around 25 years by then, from the humble
beginnings of a pair of Tri-coloured Nuns, as they used to be called, to the
Spanish Sparrow. In between were included toucans, conures, buzzards and
hoopoes and much else weird and wonderful. For some reason Eve never
quite understood, however, finches were always dominant. I think maybe it
was a recognition that it is better to be a master in something modest, than
be half-useful in everything. Also, there were so many real experts studying
and filming big, attractive, interesting birds, like flamingos, woodpeckers,
geese, pheasants, owls, parrots. I saw great value in picking up the crumbs
from the avicultural table. During my tenure in Spain I even wrote a book
on finches - sadly long out of print now, otherwise I'd go out of my way
to plug it.
So here was an entrenched European, a lesser authority on finches, going
off to a continent so rich in birds that it still contained many species not
even discovered. I found Venezuela to be even more exciting for a bird man
than I'd imagined. With well over 1,300 species it ranked only second to
Colombia as the country with the greatest variety of birds in the world. On
my first weekend's outing with the local Audubon Society I saw 122 species,
most of which I'd never seen before and many of which I'd been unable to
identify, but had noted only by quickly making sketches and diagnostic
notes to be analysed and discussed later.
Venezuela sits within 10 degrees north of the equator, and has probably
the richest variety of geography of any country, from Caribbean coast and
mountain rain forest, to Amazon jungle, from Andean heights to flat, cen-
tral plains, from a true arid desert peninsula to cloud forest where you can
actually see plants grow before your eyes. In this paradise I soon discovered
finches I hadn't realised even existed before. Month after month, excursion
after excursion, I caught, photographed, recorded, banded and released
finches which were then, and to this day are still unknown to most avicul-

turists around the world. The list includes birds like the Black-striped
Sparrow Arremonops conirostris , and the Pectoral Sparrow Arremon taci-
tumus, two very handsome big birds I found very easy to keep on a diet
of mixed seeds under very normal conditions. The Stripe-tailed Yellow-
finch Sicalis citrina, a delicate little bird, supposedly related to the robust
and aggressive Saffron Finch. It needed care and attention before settling
down in confmement.
In the introduction to my book on finches I wrote: '...with some rarely
imported species, it has not been possible to write anything because the
information simply isn't there. This was particularly the case with some
South American species'.
It is still the case for despite this experience 1 have written very little
since, and to my knowledge nobody else has either. On the continent of
Europe, those masters of aviculture, the Germans have been breeding the
rarest and scarcest of finches from South-East Asia, and other readers can
no doubt give evidence of this. Fifteen years ago the parrot finches Eryth-
rura colons and E. kleinschmidti were virtually unknown. Today they are
being bred in Germany, and Mike Fidler is hoping to establish a breeding
strain of E. colons in England. Fifteen years ago nobody in Europe was
keeping any South American brush finches, and they're still not.
Why should there be any mystery about South American finches? There
are two factors at least, maybe more. First is an unfortunate tradition
among bird trappers. In Mexico, for example, all hens that get caught go
into the pot and are eaten. They don't get released, I know because I've
been there and seen for myself, and I've eaten pajaros con arroz. I can
imagine how a classy restaurateur would describe it in his menu. 'Only
plump-breasted hen birds are gently sauteed in the finest rice, delicately

seasoned with salt and hot pepper juice'. When the Spaniards colonised
Central and South America they took with them the great Spanish tradition
of eating small birds. I well remember an English family who innocently
set up a bird feeding table in the garden. In no time the word got around
(or should I say, chirrup) and there were visiting finches all day long. What
mystified them, however, was that, when each time they returned from
holiday or a long weekend in the capital, there would be no birds coming
to be fed. It would be a week or more before there would be the beginnings
of significant numbers of birds returning. It never occurred to them to ask
their Spanish cook and her gardener/driver husband if they could throw
any light on this mystery. They assumed that the cook had continued to
put out bread, scraps and seed!
It was over a year before they discovered that the day after they went
away - every single time - the cook would trap the birds, stew them in rice
and eat them. Pajaros fritos is another favourite. In this delicious recipe
live finches are dropped into boiling oil. The feathers go all crispy and
crunchy. But before you pass out in horror, reflect for a moment on the
way we cook lobsters and other shellfish ..
I remember attempting to persuade an old trapper in Mexico of the
desirability of keeping the hen birds. I told him the crazy gringos and
ingleses, not to mention those stupid alemanes, could be persuaded to pay
even more for hens than cocks. He simply couldn't believe me. Once I ex-
plained that we wanted them to breed from, he quickly saw that if we
began breeding cardinals and finches back in our own countries, we would
soon be less likely to buy from him and he'd lose his livelihood. The Eastern
Blue Grosbeak is quite typical of the species where we only ever see male
birds. Of course some females do get through, but nowhere near enough
and with some species they are very rare indeed. Going further south, to
Peru, from where most South American shipments come these days, the
story is much the same. The birds the Indians bring in to market and supply
to the dealers are those that are easy to catch and have a certain sale. Where

the sexes are similar, or females resemble young males, they are included.
When they are caught for the pot, all birds are equal. Sadly, however, males
usually outnumber the females naturally. And females are not as hardy. In
some species, like the Carduelis siskins the rigours of trapping, retaining and
shipping wipes out 75.0% of the females anyway. The Black-hooded Siskin
Carduelis magellanicus , common over much of the continent, is a typical
species in this respect.
Twice last year I collaborated very closely with two importers in England.
One was arranging a shipment from Mexico, the other wanted birds from
Peru, and from Chile. I wrote many telexes in Spanish, and made many tele-
phone calls. I was concerned to see that the dealers at the other end really
got the message about shipping males^c/ females and would send some less
traditional species. My personal motivation was the hope that they would
include some Catamenia finches, and brush finches. Always the answer is
yes. Si, senor. Entiendo bien. No problem. The results? As always.
Not long after arriving in Venezuela I became a director of the Audubon
Society there, and acted as a guide and instructor on the monthly outings
organised for interested people. Taking from 20-50 people on a field trip
to spot birds is not easy as I'm sure many of you will attest, and small
passerines rarely stay around long enough to be studied by two to five
people, let alone 20 to 50. Thank God for buzzards and eagles, herons and
duck. Within a year I graduated to managing a major year-round survey of
a single location. Two dedicated friends and I formed the nucleus of a sur-
vey of the wildlife of a large ranch which extended from a large reservoir
in the west, over several kilometres to thick scrub in the east, from arid
hills in the north, the beginning of the foothills of the northern cordillera
which ran west to begin in the Andes, through dense gallery jungle to the
beginning of the Llanos, the plains in the South.
We took along weekend every month, for 13 months. During this period
we took high and low temperatures, counted and recorded the birds,
mammals, fishes, and either drew or photographed them all. In addition
we recorded and photographed all the flowering trees and shrubs.
There was a large triangle of flat land at the edge of the big reservoir,
favoured by finches at certain times of the year. Depending on the time of
year the reservoir either rose to a level where it flooded the area, or the
water receded to the point when the grass began to dry and die off. Most
of the year, however, the grass grew long and lush, and the ground was soft
and damp underfoot. On one occasion I'd set four 30 ft (9.14 m) mist nets
one after the other along the edge of the field. There were flocks of small
seedeaters, mostly Sporophila . I wanted to analyse them by age and sex
and be sure of the identities, and had decided to string our party out across
the area at the opposite side, and walk towards the net, driving the birds

before us.
Many of the birds flew over the nets up the surrounding hillside, but
about 150 or so flew into the net. Some folk, the children and those not
expert with mist netting retired to the jeeps and land rovers. Three of us
worked like high speed, very excited robots, ticking birds off on lists al-
ready prepared and tucked in our belts. Everytime a surprise was found
there would be a shout and we would decide whether to bag the bird for
photography later or do it there and then. We found two species of grass-
finch suspected of being there but hitherto not yet spotted.
One unexpected catch was a Ferruginous Pgymy Owl that surprised and
delighted us, and we had fun speculating on its behaviour to be found in
open grass around 11.30 in the morning. In the forest we were always able
to attract small passerines by playing a recording of this bird's call. They
would turn up fully agitated to mob the poor creature. On this particular
occasion we returned to the base camp to rest up during the heat of the
mid-day, and take a little light refreshment. The owner of the ranch turned
up there and, not knowing where we'd spent the morning, told us not to
go over to the reservoir. It seems that he and a couple of men from the
neighbouring ranch had been over there the day before and killed a couple
of dozen rattlesnakes. The damp had been ideal for frogs, and rattlers love
frogs. I nearly swooned when I thought how I'd encouraged the women
and children to walk through that grass!
During my time in Venezuela I lived in the capital city of Caracas.
Despite being incredibly over-built, with virtually no space for parks or
plants, there are many gardens, trees in the streets, and hundreds of little
corners that are wooded or covered with thick impenetrable shrub. For a
couple of years I set a trap cage or two in my garden between 6 and 7
o'clock every morning. I did not use a decoy unless I'd caught one of a
pair and was trying for the mate. All the birds were banded with single
coloured plastic rings and carefully recorded. It became fascinating to me
how some birds would come back time and again and go straight into the
trap, others might be equally regular visitors but once caught never again.
Among the finches it was easy to catch the Blue-black Grassquit Geo-
spiza (Volatinia) jacarini and the resident birds would be caught about once
a week. The territory-owning Black-faced Grassquit Tiaris bicolor could be
caught every day, and if I baited one of the traps with mealworms the same
bird could be caught twice or three times in an hour. In contrast the Saffron
Finch Sicalis flaveola could never be caught twice, furthermore even using
one of a bonded pair as a decoy it was very difficult indeed to catch the
other bird.
I have the habit of using these same drop cages in my aviaries now. I find
it a much more satisfactory way to catch a bird up than trampling over

plants with a net and terrifying many of the birds. If you're wondering how
the bird I want knows how to go into the trap, but the others not - well, it's
a matter of knowing your birds. In my case, an empty trap with no bait will
always get the parrot finches which must be among the most curious of birds.
Mealworms will get the buntings and grassquits, fruit will get the Grosbeak
Starlings. The munias will not be caught by food alone, and need a decoy.
Single birds of a species will usually be attracted by another of their own
species.
Saffron Finches cannot be caught twice. My birds have fallen for each
of my tricks - but only once. I find these birds on a par with the House
Sparrow for intelligence, and I'm sure it is no coincidence that where the
Saffron Finch is endemic, the House Sparrow has failed to establish itself.
I have written recently about the Venezuelan Saffron Finch in the^4vz-
cultural Magazine (Vol. 92, No. 2: 83), so will not go into much detail now.
Unlike the races that occur elsewhere, this race is clearly distinct between
the sexes, at all ages. The birds in juvenile plumage are distinguished by the
width of the yellow band around the nape and breast. Birds of the same age
pair up while in this plumage - indeed will often breed. They are inseparable
and where there is one, the other is close by. In adult definitive plumage
the male has a distinctly more orange crown, while the female is more stri-
ated and olivaceous on the mantle. A pair side by side in the field are very
clear.
There are many other species in the same genus as the Saffron Finch.
Frankly, I'm not sure whether the Saffron Finch is truly related to them.
It has many behaviour characteristics that remind me of the cowbirds and
grackles, or alternately the true sparrows. Sibley's protein analysis says it is
a tanager. Anyhow, the other birds in the genus Sicalis are much more
like typical grassland finches.
The Grassland Yellow Finch Sicalis luteola comes from Venezuela and
most other parts of Latin America. I kept it on two occasions there and
found it to be a dull and totally uninteresting species. Since returning to
England at the end of 1984 I have kept it on two more occasions, birds
from Guyana, and others from Peru. Each time I found it to be an amazingly
dull bird. In contrast, the Mexican race S.l. chrysops - which on compara-
tive behaviour is a very different bird indeed - is a noisy, aggressive bird
that deserves to be cultivated.
We recently received some Puna Yellow Finches S. lutea, a species
from northern Chile. It too proved to be noisy, aggressive between its own
kind, but a cheerful and persistent songbird.
In a planted aviary with just a few mealworms a day, this genus of finch
will breed and rear healthy young. My birds have not gone frantic, comb-
ing every bush and leaf for small insects when their eggs hatch in the way

that some finches will. So it's a simple recipe for success - a planted flight
to themselves, reasonable peace and quiet, and the kind of live food easily
managed at home with no need to scour the fields every morning at dawn.
One of my lifetime passions is the genus Spirophila , the 32 or so small
seedeaters of South America. Most of them come from Brazil and are
little known or understood but there are several species that occur com-
monly in aviculture. The Danes in particular seem to have bred them regu-
larly, and I'm sure the Germans also have done a lot with them. In my ex-
perience they will breed in aviaries but are reluctant to go down in cages.
There is a species, two distinct races or sibling species I'm not sure and
I don't think anybody else is. A very expert ornithologist, the late Paul
Schwarz studied both the Black and White Seedeater Sporophila bouvron-
ides and the Lined Seedeater S. lineola in Venezuela. He died before his
conclusions could be published and his notes and tapes were impounded
by the Venezuelan government as national property. Now, some five years
later, we're being allowed access to the tapes and I hope one day we'll find
all his notes on this species. It seems that lineola breeds in the south while
bouvronides is moulting and wandering around in loose flocks in the north,
sometimes reaching lineola breeding areas. Then, when bouvronides breeds
in the north, the lineola population drifts northwards in flocks of mixed
adults and juveniles.
A larger black and white Seedeater, S. luctuosa, ranges from western
Venezuela, where I saw it but never caught it, down to Peru from whence
it is exported. I had three pairs last year* I tried, but failed to breed it
in cages. The male is the bird which selects the nest site and begins making
a nest, a well-developed start to the nest plus a lot of energetic singing and

chasing is needed to stimulate the female to ovulation, I have found the
hens are very adept at ignoring the singing and resisting the chasing in
cages, whereas in an aviary the whole behaviour pattern becomes much
more natural.
Text books will say keep only one pair to an aviary else the males will
fight until one or other is killed. I have an L-shaped planted aviary, some
30 ft (9.14 m) long, with a shelter attached, and I find that a formula of
two pairs of each species produces very good results. The males set up
their own territories and sing vigorously, chasing each other furiously
when each infringes on the other&amp;apos;s air space, while the females have the
run of the establishment. Of my three pairs, one of the &amp;apos;females' moulted
out into male plumage in its third year. It had shown no sign of being a
male - by which I mean it had no white on the primary wing feathers.
I bought a single, immature Chestnut Seedeater Sporophila mekno -
cephala while living in Caracas. I painted it every couple of months as its
plumage changed, until it became a full adult male. At this point I found a
hen. They were the only two individuals I ever saw and had been imported
from Brazil, I suspect via Holland. They made a lovely pair and I was con-
vinced that I could breed them in a large flight cage. At that time my com-
pany transferred me to Chicago.
The Sporophila seedeaters fall roughly into three groups: the black-and-
white, the grey ones, and the rufous ones. May of the tiny ones from nor-
thern South America have been bred in Denmark and Germany. They are
difficult to identify as they breed within the first year, but don't attain full
definitive plumage until their second full year; and juvenile-plumaged birds
of one species are virtually identical with those of another. They are the
size of an Estrildine waxbill. I've found them to be easy to keep in cage
and aviary, mixing well, and the aggressive rivalry and singing of fit males
being harmless, not disruptive. Nowadays they are rare in captivity. I've
not been able to obtain a single one in England over the past three years
and would certainly give them priority if I had the chance.
In January, I took part in an expedition to the border between Vene-
zuela and Brazil. There, for two weeks, we caught birds, removed their lice,
photographed the birds and recorded various pertinent details, and then
released them. In addition to helping with the mist-netting, 1 took time
out to sketch the finches we caught. The Ruddy-breasted Seedeater Sporo-
phila minuta is one of the Sporophila very common in the open areas, and
I was able to paint a range of plumages. 1 have kept this bird on many
occasions. The Plumbeous Seedeater S. whitleyana plumbea , however, was
new for me. We caught just two pairs and I strongly suspect that one of
the apparent females was a second year male as it was very vocal when held.
The feeding of Sporophila seedeaters is of great interest to me. Other

writers seem to have different experiences about their need for insect food.
Jeffrey Trollope, in his book on breeding finches in 1983, describes them
as rearing young largely on insect food. Mr. Albrecht-Muller, one of the
greatest bird breeders in Denmark, successfully bred several species in cage
and aviary during the 1930s. He said they need sprouting seeds, green
seeds and a few mealworms (my experience differs). I have kept about
12 species now and only ever had one that would take mealworms - one
individual bird at that. In England last year I had nine pairs of five species,
and not one ever showed the slightest interest in mealworms in cage or
aviary.
Many years ago I acquired a pair of the Parrot-billed Seedeater S . (Neo-
rhynchus) peruvianus and went to great lengths to get data on it in the
wild. In one well-detailed field study nestlings were examined after having
been fed, and their crops were filled with fresh green seeds (Avicultural
Magazine , 73 [1967], 68-76).
I have a trio of the Drab-coloured Seedeater S. simplex in my large
planted aviary. It is absorbing to watch how they work their way through
a shrub, with considerable agility, searching and pecking the undersides of
the leaves just like a warbler - apparently taking tiny insects. I've not bred
any of these birds in this collection as the aviary is too crowded - and I'm
too stupid to resist buying a new species at every opportunity.

I well remember the first time I saw the Rufous-collared Sparrow Zono-
trichia capensis. I was visiting the Canary Islands, on business, but was de-
termined to find some genuine wild Canaries to take back home to Spain
with me. To my delight I saw a pet shop and looked in the window. There,
in the window, were three cages but instead of containing canaries they
contained a species of bird I'd never seen before. I stared fascinated. If
this was a local Canary Island bunting.but the shop keeper assured
me it came from South America, and suddenly the penny dropped.
A few years later in Venezuela I caught scores of them and became very
familiar with the species. A good friend had many of them come to her
garden where she put out fruit and rice every day. First with the use of
trap cages, then mist nets, we quickly managed to catch most of the local
sparrow population and banded each with a single coloured plastic ring. It
was a big surprise one afternoon, when taking tea at another friend's house
the two of us spotted a sparrow with a yellow band at the bird table. This
set off a real interest in the birds of the neighbourhood among the neigh-
bours, and subsequently this resulted in a successful attempt to work out
the territories of the various banded birds.
On my Brazilian border trip I caught quite a few of the Roraima
Rufous-collared Sparrow Z. capensis roraimae and was fascinated to note
the difference in plumage as compared to the Venezuelan raceZ. capensis
venezuelae I was more familiar with. Both Roraima and the Andean race
Z. capensis costaricensis are duller in comparison. It is the latter which is
usually imported from Peru.
Some of the birds in our garden banding study had growths on their
feet, and we also found these on another species that came regularly to
the feeders, the Ochre-breasted Brush-finch semirufous.
I took some of these birds home to keep for a while to see whether I
could cure them. I must admit that I am not the Birdman of Alcatraz, or
anywhere, and after a while I decided that I could not effect a quick
cure, but neither did the condition seem to be contagious. My theory,
however, was that the birds were eating too much plain white rice - and
milled white rice has virtually no food value at all. The only other birds
that gorged on the rice were the doves and cowbirds, neither of which
seemed to have any foot problems.
A plague of cats put paid to the bird feeding for about two years, by
which time I'd left Venezuela to live in Chicago. I returned for a holiday
however, and went up into the hills to see my friend. She had begun
feeding the birds again, two ferocious dogs having completely cured the
cat problem. This time no rice, only fruit, wholemeal bread and a little
millet seed. My friend was keen to repeat the banding operation and we
set some mist nets and managed to catch several of the local birds which

we again banded. To our delight there was not one case of bumble foot,
and we caught two birds that had been banded before, one four years
earlier.
It seems crazy, but I think those bumblefoot birds had become too
dependant on that white rice and were even feeding it to nestlings. There's
a lesson there.
The local brush-finch Atlapetes semirufous is common and widespread
all along the hill country in northern South America, and can often be
seen travelling around in small groups. It's the only brush-finch I know
that forages in the upper reaches of bushes and small trees; I've seen it 10
to 15 ft (3.04 - 4.57 m) above ground. It is beautiful, sings well - but
wouldn't win any prizes - and is very easy to keep in cages where it steadies
down quickly. It would make an absolutely perfect aviary bird and one
I'm sure would breed well given suitable conditions - thick shrubbery
with peace and quiet.
But to the best of my knowledge, it has never been seen in aviculture
outside my personal experience.
Many is the time, while sitting still and silent in the rain forest, waiting
for birds to come along, I've heard the regular rustle of a brush-finch as it
has worked its way over the floor of the forest, kicking leaves aside with
each hop, picking up seeds and insects.
In studying these species in the wild, and in large cages where they've
been kept with other birds, large and small, I've never seen any aggression
between adult birds - nor indeed by any brush-finch ever. They seem to
live mainly on seeds, but will take a little softbill food, fruit and greens,
and any mealworms or other insect life. The immatures stay in the company
of their parents until fully moulted into adult plumage. I have now kept
several species of brush-finch since my early experiences with the Ochre-
breasted and will write a full length article about them sometime. Mean-
while, if any reader has any experience with any of the genus, I'd be
delighted to hear from him or her.
Another group of birds common in the neo-tropics are the saltators.
After disovering that a persistent songster outside my bedroom window
was a Greyish Saltator Saltator caerulescens, I wrote to my old friend
(now the late) Herbert Murray. Herbert was undoubtedly the most ex-
perienced man in England with tanagers and South American seedeating
birds. To call a Greyish Saltator a finch may seem odd if one thinks of a
canary as being the definitive finch, but this big creature is as much a
finch as any other bird I've mentioned here. I caught one of these biggies.
It fed on papaya, mango, lettuce and everything in the food tray, but no
seed.
My careful observations of the bird in the wild seemed to suggest that

<bodyText confidence="0.998935933333333" page_id="56240688"  page_num="218" year="" vol="">
it fed almost exclusively on buds, leaves and fruit. It was big, and a little
dull and I soon released it once I'd made a coloured sketch for future
reference. Old Herbert wrote back something like this, '.one of the
dullest birds I've ever kept. The pair lived for years - doing nothing except
eat, and they seemed to eat a bit of everything and anything. When they
finally died they went unlamented'.
The next Saltator I caught was a lustrous creature, the Streaked Salta-
tor S. albicollis , a truly lovely bird. Being short of space I put him in with
a Kiskadee Flycatcher, but he was terrified of his companion and was too
frightened to feed, nearly starving to death. I force fed him for two days,
with mealworms dipped in multivitamin powder and water enriched with
glucose. He recovered quickly and after a short period in a small, covered
cage, settled well. But he would only ever eat my own soft food mixture
and mealworms - refusing all fruit and seed.
The following year I brought another one home. In constrast to my
first experience, this bird settled immediately taking fruit, softfood, seeds
and mealworms but really preferring orange to anything else. If nothing
else this shows that you cannot draw conclusions from experiences with
just one bird. My observations of the bird in the wild indicate a normal
diet exactly like the Greyish Saltator - buds and leaves.
Once during our year-round study of the ranch we came across a pair
of Orinoco SaltatorsS. orenocensis and watched them feeding for some 20
minutes or so. They were working their way around and through the
branches of trees at a height of between 15 and 20 ft (4.57-6.09 m) from
the ground. They seemed to be taking insects. A couple of weeks later I
spotted a freshly-killed bird by the roadside - a car strike - and was delighted
to discover that not only was it an Orinoco Saltator but I'd found it
before the flies or the ants had, and it soon went into the freezer to await
a time when I could make this sketch. Earlier this year, while driving up
the Orinoco valley, I was able to watch another pair of these birds, again

patiently and diligently working their way through the foliage, nipping
buds and picking little unknowns and eating them. My last Saltator is the
Buff-throated S, maximus. We caught a few of them in open scrub forest
at the edge of thick gallery forest. I kept one in a holding cage for about
36 hours and it readily took my usual foreign finch seed mixture and
drank water, but I was unable to give it a fair trial. Fm sure it would take
leaves, buds and fruit.
There are several siskins in South America, including the most famous
Red Siskin Carduelis cucuilatus from Venezuela. This bird is- in genuine
danger of extinction in our lifetime due to the depredations of trappers for
the European bird trade. They are trapped, smuggled out to the small
Dutch Antilles islands off the coast of Venezuela, and then flown to Hol-
land. Venezuela has probably the best conservation laws of any country in
the world, but the enforcement of the law is another matter and there is
big money in Red Siskins. The tragedy of this bird is not so much that it is
being taken for aviculture - for it almost isn't - as that it is being taken to
hybridise with the domestic canary in the false pursuit of a red canary. I
was delighted to learn, during a visit to Australia this year, that it is well
established and is breeding regularly. However, the colour has faded and
none of the birds there have the strength of red of wild Red Siskins.
Forgive me if I take off on a personal hobby horse for a moment. The
Carduelis siskins are NOT closely enough related genetically to the Serinus
canaries for all the eggs in the ovaries to be perfect. Twenty-five percent of
eggs laid in every pure Red Siskin x. Canary breeding are dead-in-shell.
Mendel's laws of genetics say that there is a lethal factor in the mix, and
since no red offspring has ever been produced, it's very obvious that the
pure red genetic factor cannot be carried to the totally non-red canary. So
the result at best is reddish hybrids which are usually fed with colorants to
build the illusion of a near-red canary.
The irony is that there is a true Serin which carries pure red. It is the
Red-fronted Serin Serinus pusillus from northern Turkey and the southern
parts of the USSR. This species is genetically close enough to impart 100%
of its red factor to a domestic canaiy. I've been told the problem is that
the black tends to mask the red. Maybe, but what became of the dream to
breed a black Canary anyway - like the black tulip? In the range of skins of
the Red-fronted Serin in the British Museum collection are a few males with
very extensive red; one had the red extending to mantle and flanks.
None of the South American siskins travel well. Many die en route
and many of those that arrive die in quarantine. I have advised my friends
in the trade not to order them. Of the survivors, the majority are males
This means a frustrated avicultural community, and added strength to the
disinterest in South American finches. Why they should be delicate in this

way I'm not sure but in my personal experience I'd say it is undoubtedly
the treatment the birds receive during the first few days after being trapped.
Shock is a very real factor, and tropical siskins can shock easily. They need
quiet, space, very clean conditions with fresh water, a variety of seeds in-
cluding fresh green millet. The opposite of these conditions will guarantee
failure. I have experience of freshly-caught birds appearing to eat normally
but under the stress of a noisy bird room going light very quickly, and
dying. I believe they live off their body fat and are not eating at all, just
cracking seed and dropping it.
The Pileated Finch Lophospingus pileatus is a bird that used to be
offered years ago, but I don't remember seeing it for many years now. It's
fairly common in Venezuela and we caught it quite often, both odd birds,
and small family groups. The bright red of the crest contrasts very well
with the soft grey body. It is a bird of open forest undergrowth, retiring
and shy, behaving much like a bush warbler continually on the move
apparently seeking small insects. On two or three occasions I kept it in a
holding cage at the campsite, ready for our drive back to Caracas, but it
faded very quickly. A bird caught on Saturday morning would be almost
dead by Sunday. At first I thought they were suffering from shock, which
might have been the case, and they would take no seed at all. I released
every one.
Eventually I decided only to take home a pair of birds that were
caught just an hour before we struck for home, and so got them to my
bird room within a couple of hours. To cut a long story short, they are not
seedeating finches. To begin with they would only take mealworms, then a
little softfood, but no seed. They would search furiously through the seed
pots looking for something they never found. They were sold and kept as
seedeaters when I was young, and I'm now keeping my eyes open for a
shipment to England to see what they're feeding upon.
Incidentally this is one of the genera of birds we've thought were
finches, but which Sibley's egg white protein analysis says is a tanager.
Before leaving Venezuela I acquired a pair of Red-crested Finches, a
closely-related species, and had no difficulty with them at all. They ate
seed from the outset.
There are many cardinals in South America. One is a rare scarlet bird
the Phoenix or Venezueland Cardinal C. phoenicea, superficially similar
to the widespread and common Virginian Cardinal Cardinal cardinalis of
North America. Unfortunately this bird is delicate, barely surviving in a
narrow ecological niche about which virtually nothing is known. During
my three years' residence in Venezuela I managed to obtain only two birds,
a male and a female, which seemed to pair up satisfactorily. They seemed
easy to maintain, in good health with a diet of mixed seeds, a regular

softbill mixture which they enjoyed enormously, an orange every day -
that was a great favourite - and all the crisp fruits like apple and pear. Of
the seeds they consumed, about half of the volume were sunflower. It
was a great sadness to me that I was unable to give these birds quarters
to breed in, and we eventually released them in the semi-desert scrubby
part of a private ranch.
Herbert Murray had kept a pair for many years, but failed to breed
them. He agreed with feeding them as one would a tanager. In his opinion,
and I quote,: They are easily the most magnificent cardinals, and one of
the most splendid and desirable birds I have ever kept'.
The black-eared race of the Red-capped Cardinal Paroaria gularis
nigrogensis came my way by chance and I found it to be an easy bird
to maintain, similar to the Yellow-billed, being peaceful and showy. I
also obtained an immature Yellow-billed P. capitata and painted it regu-
larly as it grew older, changing from the softly-shaded immature to the
clean and bright adult. These birds also were very fond of oranges, took
various seeds, and were always first to the mealworm pot. I had several
individuals over a couple of years, and found them to be great person-
alities. They show an interest - often open curiosity - in everything going
on around them.I'd say they were very suitable for an aviary or running
loose in the birdroom.
And finally a bitter-sweet story of the last of these birds, the Black-
crested Finch Lophospingus pusillus. I have only kept odd individuals,
but Herbert Murray kept and bred it in one of his enormous planted
aviaries. He found it to be a bird of low bushes, but would show off well
and quickly come close when the mealworm tray arrived. His pair bred
naturally, building their own nest in a shrub quite close by a nest of Gold-
finches. Unfortunately as both broods grew, the Goldfinches were larger,
more visible, and audible - calling for food the way temperate zone nestlings
so often will. They were irresistible to the Black-crested Finches who fed
the young Goldfinches whole mealworms and anything else they could find.
The nestling Black-cresteds died, but the Goldfinches thrived and fledged

I have kept many more South American finches than mentioned in
these notes, and intend to write about them in the future. These notes are
intended more as an introduction. I apologise for wandering off into anec-
dotal reminiscence at times.
In conclusion I have found the neo-tropical finches to be a distinct and
different group from either the birds of the northern temperate zones, or
the Old World tropical finches like waxbills, munias, weavers and whydahs.
They tend to be delicate but will eventually become quite hardy and long
lived once settled in suitable permanent quarters. Unlike the finches of the
temperate zones in my experience I feel it is not normally essential to pro-
vide separate enclosures for each breeding pair, but most of them can be
aggressive and breeding hopes may be dashes if they are crowded at all.
Feeding requirements are fairly typical with live food usually needed dur-
ing the first couple of weeks after the eggs hatch.
Most of all, I find the neo-tropical finches are the least known, and
with very few exceptions, the least written about of the finches. I believe
they provide more challenges and opportunities for aviculturists to make
new contributions to our knowledge of birds than any other group of
finches from any other part of the world. If these notes have stimulated
any reader to consider writing about practical experiences, I will be deligh-
ted.
As a postscript, an appeal.
In my well-planted, small garden aviary, at the time of writing, I have
two Sierra-Finches Phrygilus gayii or P. patagonicus. I cannot identify
them by race or sex. I suspect I have two females. If any reader has any of
these birds, please write to me. Thank you.

In 1986 Ana and Eduardo Asanza of the Catholic University of Ecua-
dor studied the Lilacine Amazon Parrot in the wild, from 29th October
to 6th November. The subsequent report was made to Zoologische Gesell-
schaft fur Arten- und Populationsschutz (Zoological Society for the Con-
servation of Species and Populations). Roland Wirth, an official of that
society, passed the report* to me with the request that half the proceeds
of anything that I published from the report should be donated to that
society. This I have done where appropriate but as the Avicultural Society
does not, of course, make payment for articles, I draw members 1 attention
to the existence of this German organisation.
The Lilacine Amazon is not well known in aviculture and, unfortunately,
is declining in its limited area of distribution in Ecuador. It occurs only in
the central-western part, in the provinces of Guayas and Manabi. The
study areas were in the tropical coastal zone, part of the area being sub-
tropical desert with an average temperature of 24*C. Vegetation consists
of small, spiny trees and deciduous trees.
This Amazon is found from sea level up to 720 m. Between 200 and
500 m the mean annual rainfall is less than 800 mm and the temperature
averages 22*C. Vegetation is dry and deciduous. From 500 to 720 m the
vegetation is always green and characterised by cloud forest. There is less
than 1,000 mm of rain.
This Amazon was found to be more common up to 300 m during the
study period. Groups of 14 birds were observed daily in the Daular zone,
flying or perched in high trees such as Ceiba. In one hour's continuous
observation, 24 birds were seen, generally in groups of three.
In the zone to the north and east observations were rarer. In one
hour's continuous observation seven birds were seen and, in the higher
zone, none. Some of the local people did not know it; others occasionally
saw a few in flight.
In the higher zone there were frequent observations of six to 26 Red-
headed Conures Aratinga erythrogenys and 10 to 30 Celestial Parrotlets
Forpus coelestis and Orange-flanked Parrakeets Brotogeris pyrrhopterus ,
either flying or perched in high trees.

No Buffon's Macaws Ara ambigua guayaquilensis were seen; according
to the local people, these were either persecuted or captured. A few had
been seen in February and March 1986. The Lilacine Amazon and
Buffon's Macaw nest on the lower zone (up to 280 m), in areas domina-
ted by spiny trees, from January to March. They nest in holes in the trunks
of high trees (such as Ceiba and Tabebuia donnellsmithii ).
The principal fruit in the diet of lilacina is muyuyo Cordia lutea from
which its local name of 'lora muyuyera' or 'manglera' (the tree is also
known as 'el mangle') is derived. This tree is also used for roosting. Other
fruits eaten are mango Mangifera indica, Spondias pourpurea and species
of Minquartia. In the western lower coastal zone cultivated fruits, including
coffee berries, are consumed.
The Lilacine Amazon was observed most frequently between Novem-
ber and March, coinciding with the breeding season and the fruiting of
many plants on which they feed. From about April to September (the
dry season) they were less often observed using such roosting sites as
sugar cane and vegetation in stream beds, or Tabebuia *
Extraction of wood is still occurring in the small remaining zones of
native vegetation, mainly Guayacan and laurel, especially in the higher
zones. Many summer roads exist, used by wood cutters, which cross
these zones. Numerous sites without native vegetation were found where
there were large areas of pasture or desert.
Agricultural areas are now extending higher and higher into the moun-
tains. Native vegetation is cut and burned to make way for large areas of
banana plantations or for coffee, citrus, cocoa or yucca. Local people cut
the trees to produce charcoal. Adjoining cultivated areas provide grazing
for goats, donkeys and Brahman sheep.
Exactly the same circumstances apply throughout much of tropical
South America, gradually eroding the habitat of hundreds of species of
birds and animals.
Illegal trade is also widespread. In Bolivia the species most affected
are the Lilacine Amazon, Buffon's Macaw, Orange-flanked Parrakeet
and, to a lesser degree, the Red-headed Conure and the Celestial Parrot-
let,
Locally a Lilacine Amazon costs between 3,000 to 5,000 sucres (20-35
US dollars), Buffon's Macaw about 6,000 (40 dollars) and the Red-headed
Conure 2,000 sucres (14 dollars). Contrast this with the cost of a piglet -
3,000 sucres.
The majority of the birds captured have been ordered in advance.
According to the catchers, there are many areas where parrots and macaws
were common three to five years ago - but now they are scarce and diffi-
cult to capture. In general, trappers are people of few resources and this

activity is a form of subsistence.
Ana and Eduardo Asanza concluded that progressive destruction of
habitat and illegal trade (national and international) are the most impor-
tant factors in the decline of the Lilacine Amazon. But fords Macaw is so
scarce that it is in danger of disappearing from Ecuador.
They believe that: 1) The volume of trapping must be rigorously con-
trolled; 2) An ecological reserve is urgently required in some zones (for
animals and flora as well); 3) A programme of afforestation must be im-
plemented for native trees to prevent further erosion and desertification.
The fact that trade is one of the two significant factors in the decline
of the Lilacine Amazon, yet it is a comparatively rare bird in aviculture,
indicates that (as with most species with a limited area of distribution) its
population is not large. The only justification for keeping the Lilacine
Amazon in captivity is, therefore, breeding. As yet, this has been achieved
worldwide in probably fewer than a dozen collections. Unless more birds
with a similar status to this Amazon Parrot are bred in captivity, bird
keepers will continue to be labelled by many as consumers - not as con-
servationists.
Let me make a plea to those with unsexed or unpaired Lilacine Ama-
zons in their collections to do something about it.

INTRODUCED AND RE-INTRODUCED BIRDS IN BRITAIN

It occurred to me, stirred by our fair editor's request for copy ('The
woman tempted me' - Adam), that a short account and commentary on
some of the species of birds now existing in a free state in Britain as a
result of introduction or re-introduction by many might be of interest to
some of our members. I have dealt with this subject elsewhere (Goodwin,
1978) but I do not flatter myself that many of my present readers will
have read the book in question. To those that have, I apologise for a certain
amount of inevitable overlapping here with what I have written in it.
Contemporary opinion of 'experts'(sometimes self-styled) on these
matters, or at least, which is perhaps not quite the same thing, of those
'experts' who have power to enforce their views, would appear to be
roughly as follows: (1) All introductions of exotic birds or mammals are
wrong unless the creatures are introduced for 'sport', that is to be killed
for pleasure. It is now illegal to introduce foreign species to Britain for any
other purpose. Similar views and laws, I believe, now obtain in the USA,
Canada and Australia, (2) The re-introduction of locally exterminated
(even if long ago exterminated) birds of prey is, however, a good thing ,
even in the case of species that, when plentiful, were regarded as a nuis-
ance.
So far as birds are concerned there have certainly been some unfortu-
nate introductions into America and Australia, at least in the case of the
Starling and House Sparrow. Or so we think, forgetting perhaps that, how-
ever different our value judgements in the matter, the homesick emigrants
wanted to see Starlings and House Sparrows rather than Rosellas and Red-
headed Woodpeckers and, like us in comparable situations, neither thought
nor cared that their grandchildren might think differently.
If we compare the (so far) successfully introduced birds of Britain with
those of the USA or Australia, we at once realise that, in part, very differ-
ent aims and motives were involved. In all three countries the desire of the
sportsmen for new and hopefully 'better' gamebirds and wildfowl for
'sporting' purposes was the motive behind some introductions, but where-
as in the USA and Australia homesickness inspired the introduction of
many common and plentiful birds of the 'old country', including some
that were there regarded as all too-plentiful pests, in Britain no such motive
was at work and, apart from those introduced for 'sport', only species
remarkable for their beauty and interest or marked difference from native

species were introduced.
I shall confine this article to species that can be considered as established
here, albeit precariously in some cases. I shall not include &amp;apos;failed' species
like the Pekin Robin or those that appear to exist only in very small num-
bers and/or in very circumscribed areas, such as the Egyptian Goose, Crane
and Robwhite Quail. Nor shall I include such native wildfowl as the Pintail
and Gad waif whose numbers and breeding ranges in Britain were greatly
and apparently permanently increased as a result of their being introduced
into new areas by human agency. Nor shall I include the Common Pheas-
ant, which deserves an article to itself at some later date.
Canada Goose Brant a canadensis
This strikingly patterned and musically voiced bird seems to have been
first introduced in the 18th century as a park ornament. In more recent
decades large numbers were presented to the authorities in charge of some
London parks as a result of estate owners finding their numbers a bit too
much of a good thing on their own grounds and to their being spread about
by shooting interests. The Canada Goose does not, however, find favour
with all sportsmen because of its tendency to fly disconcertingly low and
to become semi-tame unless constantly harried. Details of its history and
distribution can be found in the splendid atlases of British birds (Lack,
1986; Sharrock, 1976).
The Canada Goose is now probably our most widely distributed wild
goose. Certainly it is the one with the widest breeding range in Britain and
the one most familiar to the average person. It has been locally blamed for
feeding on young wheat and other crops but does not appear to have (or
even to have been accused of having) an adverse effect on other species.
The situation in regard to the Grey Lag Goose might, however, involve
competition between them in the future. They now occur together in
parts of Kent. Like all other stronger and more pushful species (including
the native Mallard) Canada Geese may be formidable competitors with
smaller, pinioned waterfowl in public parks where, as is often the case,
these are forced to compete for handouts from the public (or starve).
Grey Lag Goose Anser anser
This goose is believed to have bred widely in lowland Britain before
being gradually exteminated in the wild form by persecution and domes-
tication. By the turn of the century, and for some four or five decades
afterwards, it was confined as a breeding species in Britain to parts of
northern and western Scotland. In recent years it has been widely intro-

duced, mainly or entirely by shooting interests, into south-eastern England
where it is now locally common but on the whole much less widespread
and numerous than is the Canada Goose.
I and others have seen apparent hybrids between Greylag and Canada
Geese at large in Kent and Surrey. Whether these hybrids were bred in a
feral state or bred in captivity and then turned loose, I do not know. All
that I have seen were consorting with Canada Geese,
As an aesthetic embellishment to the countryside, the Grey Lag rates
about equal to the Canada Goose in appearance though decidedly below
it vocally, its voice being little if any more musical than that of its farm-
yard descendants.
Needless to say, the continued existence of either this species or the
Canada Goose in so densely populated a country as England depends
absolutely on a considerable degree of tolerance on the part of both
officialdom and private landowners.
Ruddy Duck Oxyura jamaicensis
The British population of this quaint but beautiful duck apparently
originated in escapees from the Slimbridge collection. There seems reason
to hope that the species is now firmly established. It is as yet, however,
only locally abundant, mainly in parts of western and southern England,
parts of the Welsh border and the Isle of Anglesey (see Lack for fuller
details).
An extremely aquatic freshwater duck, needing waters with extensive
muddy shallows and reeds or other emergent vegetation, the Ruddy Duck
has no congeners here and, it would seem, no serious ecological competi-
tors. Those who object to all introductions on principle have been hard
put to find a 'good' stick to beat this one with. So far as I know, the best
they have come up with is that its being established here already might, at
some distant future date, prevent the establishment here of the White-headed
Duck O. leucocephala of Western Asia, in the very unlikely event of that
species deciding to emulate the Collared Dove and spread westward into
Europe.
To which my answer is that the entertaining and handsome Ruddy
Ducks now on some of our lakes and reservoirs are worth more than any
number of the less beautiful White-headed Ducks in some highly hypo-
thetical future.
The introduction of this species was, we are assured, entirely accidental
All those who rejoice to see a Ruddy Drake with his chestnut, white and
black plumage and exquisitely beautiful blue bill without having to take a
trip to the USA (or even to Slimbridge) to do so will, nevertheless, be for-
ever grateful to those who made such a happy accident possible.

Mandarin Duck Abe galericulata
The Mandarin Drake, as most of my readers will know, is one of the
most beautiful ducks in the world and also the strangest in appearance,
with its hackled neck and enormously enlarged inner webs of the two
innermost secondaries, which stand up like little sails when the bird is at
ease and still more when he is displaying.
Although not so abundant and widespread as the Ruddy Duck, the
Mandarin has been here much longer as a wild-living bird. I first saw it
when I was nine, in 1929. Windsor Great Park and nearby areas of Surrey
and Berkshire were then, and still are, its headquarters but it has spread
somewhat and Mr. Andy Davies, who has made a long-term study of it, has
shown that its numbers may be significantly increased by the provision of
suitable nesting boxes.
Elsewhere in England and in the one locality in Scotland where it
occurs, local populations appear usually or always to be based on some
waterfowl collection.
The Mandarin needs a combination of water - lakes, ponds, slow-
flowing streams or canals - and woodland with hole-containing trees
(although, as has been said, nest-boxes can replace natural tree holes) and
with plenty of oaks and sweet chestnut trees. Acorns and chestnuts, taken
from the ground and, more especially, from the bottom of shallow water,
are usually the main winter foods. Beech nuts are also taken and probably
preferred when available but, at least in Kent and Surrey, most beech trees
seem only to bear a crop of nuts once in several years, though in the inter-
vening years they often bear crops of a kind of false nut consisting of an
empty shell with no kernel.
Waterside cover, especially of overhanging Rhododendrons, is also
liked by Mandarins and may be essential for successful breeding. The
type of habitat apparently needed by Mandarins is limited and, like most
other habitats, ever threatened by forestry and building interests. True
there are many areas of suitable habitat as yet unpopulated but to get to
them the birds would have to fly 'on spec' over much unsuitable ground.
This they seem usually, and understandably, reluctant to do, though there
are a few records of such distance flights. Notably that of two ringed
Mandarins that flew from Norway to Northumberland, where they were
promptly shot.
Of all our introduced species there is none of more value, on both
aesthetic and conservational grounds. Much less abundant and widespread
than formerly in its natural Far Eastern range and at least potentially
threatened there, its continued survival might, as K.J. Herber truly says
(Lack, 1986), one day depend on the British population As a living orna-
ment it has few equals, and although, like other birds that are shot for

sport or food, it is usually shy of man, where it sees him frequently and is
not persecuted by him it soon becomes relatively unperturbed by his
presence and gladdens the eye of the ordinary passer-by as well as the bird-
watcher with binoculars.
It has been estimated (Davies, 1985) that there may now be as many as
850 to 1,000 pairs of Mandarins at large in Britain. This may seem a lot
but even if, happily, not an over-estimate, it is still a very vulnerably small
number.
I would like to think that this lovely bird will 'go from strength to
strength' in Britain and hope that I am wrong in fearing it is unlikely to do
so. But it has much against it. Lack of suitable contiguous habitat I have
touched on above. Judging from the relatively few well-grown broods I
have seen, Mandarin ducklings would appear if anything even more threat-
ened by predation and/or other forms of mortality in their early weeks
than those of other species. When I have seen a duck with well-grown young
these have usually numbered only from one to three. The adults, like our
other ducks, are shot for 'sport' but happily at least some of their haunts
are unfrequented by sportsmen.
There seems another and potentially devastating threat to our Mandarins
in the recently introduced (or re-introduced) Goshawk Accipiter gentilis. In
Europe, this species is known often to specialise in catching Stock Doves
Columba oenas and Black Woodpeckers Dryocopus martius by lurking in
cover nearby until they visit or return to their nest holes. It is known to
exterminate local breeding populations of the Stock Dove (possibly also
of the Black Woodpecker) in this way in woodland which provides cover
for the hawk within suitable distance of the holes. If, when its numbers in-
crease (as they appear to be doing), the Goshawk adapts this behaviour to
nesting Mandarins, then the latter will almost certainly soon be wiped out
here. The more so as the Goshawk is stringently protected while the Man-
darin is still considered a legitimate object of 'sport'.
Any mass introduction of the Wood or Carolina Duck Abe sponsa,
would also pose a potential threat to our Mandarins. This species, which is
apparently breeding locally in small numbers in a more or less feral state
(Sharrock) has similar ecological requirements and would be bound, if it
did succeed, to do so only as a result of successful competition with the
Mandarin. Both are lovely birds but I think all our efforts should be to tip
the balance in favour of the Mandarin. The latter is threatened in its native
haunts whereas the Wood Duck is not as, although it is shot for sport (is
there any creature so beautiful that sportsmen would not get a thrill from
killing it?), there are many in the USA with its interests at heart and, al-
though not a 'common object' in its native haunts, it seems now to be in
safe numbers there.

Sea Eagle or White-tailed Eagle Haliaetus albicilla
This bird, spectacular for its size if not for any particular grace or
beauty, was for long an inhabitant of the coasts of northern Britain,
being mentioned in one of the earliest extant Anglo-Saxon poems.
It was, whether with or without any justification I do not feel qualified
to judge, persecuted by shepherds, crofters and sportsmen and, with a
little help in the later stages from skin and egg collectors, finally extermin-
ated here. It is said (Goldsmith, 1864) that in Orkney eagles (probably of
this species) were considered so harmful that anybody who killed one was
entitled to a chicken from every house in the parish.
The re-introduction of this species was a project conceived and exe-
cuted by the Nature Conservancy Council (Sexton, 1987). From 1975 on-
wards numbers of young Sea Eagles were procured from Norway each
June, kept on the Isle of Rhurn through the summer and released there in
the autumn. The first known successful breeding of a pair of these birds
took place in 1984.
It is perhaps too early to speculate whether this project will fully
succeed and, if it does, whether any drawbacks will attend the results.
Obviously life will be made more hazardous and violent death more fre-
quent for some other forms of life, among them the sea ducks and divers.
If any of the released Sea Eagles have lost their fear of man, they might
prove dangerously bold if confronted with some person wittingly or un-
wittingly approaching their nest or, if hungry, with a very small child.
However, it is, I should think, fairly sure that those responsible will have
foreseen and taken steps to forestall any such possibilities.
One thing is certain and that is that very many birdwatchers, unlike
myself, find birds of prey more attractive than those of other families and,
if the Sea Eagle project succeeds, will consider their outings on or around
the west coast of Scotland (and later, no doubt, elsewhere as well) greatly
enhanced by the presence of this immense raptor.
Goshawk Accipiter gentilis
It seems less certain that this species, as its admirers claim, was once a
genuine member of our avifauna, for the habit of releasing birds of prey in
the hopes that they will breed locally goes back to distant days of mediae-
val falconry, to say nothing of the numbers of trained birds that falconers,
ancient and modem, not infrequently lose. True the Goshawk breeds widely
in western Europe but so do some other species that have not yet (so far as
is known) ever bred in these islands.
Be that as it may, the Goshawks now living and breeding in Britain are
known (Marquiss and Newton, 1982) to have their origin in birds deliber-
ately imported for falconry or scientific studies and which escaped or (the

majority) were deliberately released. Although private individuals (one in
particular) appear to have been directly responsible, officialdom granted
permits for the importation of the birds and would appear to have been
firmly behind the project.
This is the only one of our introduced or re-introduced species which l
think might better not have been brought to these islands. Aesthetically,
the bird is just a big, rather dull-coloured Sparrowhawk. From a conserva-
tional standpoint, as it occurs widely across much of the northern hemi-
sphere, it is in no need of having its range artificially extended. It is well
known to be most destructive of free range poultry, more conspicuous
hawks such as the Buzzard in Europe and the Red-tailed Hawk in the USA
being often mistakenly blamed for its depredations. It takes a wide range
of prey, both birds and mammals so that there can be no check on its
population if it seriously depletes the numbers of particular species. In
Britain its diet includes such relatively rare and/or decreasing species such
as the Black Grouse Tetrao tetrix, Red Squirrel Sciurus vulgaris and Grey
Partridge Perdix perdix.
It is admittedly said to be no danger to the Grey Partridge (Potts, 1986)
but some disagree with this verdict. I am assured by a very competent
ornithologist that it is responsible for local extermination of the Caper-
caillie Tetrao urogallus in Germany.
Much has been made of the numbers of Wood Pigeons taken by the
Goshawk but in relation to the existing numbers of different prey species ,
there is no evidence for any preference for, or particular success at catch-
ing this species even although the male Goshawk is said to be able to fly
down pigeons in chases over a long distance in the open sky (Nicolai, 1982)
a remarkable feat (if it is always successful) for mAccipiter.
The Goshawk is known to be aggressive towards other large birds of
prey (smaller ones, like the Sparrowhawk, it includes in its menu). It may
well make life more difficult for these when they exist or try to exist in
the same neighbourhood. This is apparently especially so in the case of the
Honey Buzzard Pernis apivorus , which avoids and/or is driven away from
areas inhabited by the Goshawk (Kostrzewa, 1987).
All in all, 1 think that the Goshawk's introduction seems likely to
result in a decline in numbers of such native species as the Red Squirrel,
Black Grouse and Stock Dove, and to have similar, or even worse effects
on the Capercaillie and Mandarin Duck.
Golden Pheasant Chrysolophus pictus
This beautiful and interesting species has often been introduced, mainly
one supposes by aviculturists captivated by its beauty, since its lack ol
&amp;apos;sporting qualities' have generally made it disliked by sportsmen. Its dis-

tribution is scattered and local, with the main populations in the Breek-
lands of Norfolk and Suffolk, the South Downs in Hampshire and West
Sussex and part of south-western Scotland (Ridley, in Lack).
In Britain Golden Pheasants inhabit conifer plantations where the trees
are between 10 and 30 years old and exclude much of the light so there is
no undergrowth, or in mature Yew forest with similar bare ground and
gloom beneath the trees. As the birds are, it appears, though derived from
semi-tame captives, extremely shy of man (Colin Harrison, pers. comm.;
Ridley, in Lack) it is clear that he must be, or recently have been a major
predator on them.
Nothing appears to be known of the Golden Pheasant's breeding habits
in the wild in Britain.
As many of my readers will know, Golden Pheasants in an aviary or
when at liberty in a garden, do not avoid small open areas. If, therefore,
the introduced population were ever to increase and spread, it could, if not
persecuted by man , become a delight to the eyes of all who appreciate
bright and lovely birds.
What effect the Goshawk will have on its as yet small numbers (estima-
ted by Ridley as 'perhaps 1000 to 2000') remains to be seen. In the habi-
tat described for them they may well be at little risk but if, as I suspect
may be the case, they do, in fact, come into rides, paths and other more
open areas when people are not about, they may prove highly vulnerable.
Amherst Pheasant Chrysolophus amberstiae
Many attempts have been made to introduce this magnificent bird
(Lever, 1977; Sharrock) but the only (possibly) viable present popula-
tion appears to be in adjacent areas of Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and
Buckinghamshire in southern central England ( Ridley, in Lack) .
Because of its 'poor sporting qualities' attempts have been made to
exterminate it (Sharrock) but, happily, have failed. This should be no
cause for complacency by the bird's admirers since with a species present
in such small numbers ( estimated by Ridley at 200 to 500) and one which
does not and cannot fly far when alarmed, any even moderately efficient
attempt to exterminate it could not possibly fail to succeed.
The habitat choice of this species in Britain is similar to that of its
congener the Golden Pheasant (q.v.).
The presence of feral populations of these two wonderful birds ought
to be welcomed unreservedly. There is, it is true, the possibility that if
both increased and spread they would meet and hybridise, as have the
Alectoris partridges and the various races of the Common Pheasant. This
would be a pity although a hybrid population would be better than none
at all. In any case in the, unfortunately improbable, event of either or both

species so increasing and spreading, it will then be time enough to consider
whether any humane and non-lethal measures could be devised to keep
their populations apart.
Both have very small world ranges, with the potential danger that this
must ever entail for a species, especially in a modern, man-controlled and
man-dominated world. The establishment of feral populations of either or
both away from their homelands is to be recommended. It is often said
that they are safe enough as they are widely kept and breed well in cap-
tivity. This is, however, to put overmuch faith in our fragile western civili-
sation continuing. Only if many people are living at what is by world
standards a pretty high standard, are they likely to be able to keep and
breed pheasants, if they wish to do so. We have only to look around to
know that the relatively affluent and humane nations are threatened by
the ever increasing successes of their criminal elements, while elsewhere
tyranny, religious intolerance and famine increasingly prevail.
Red-legged and Chukar Partridges Alectoris rufa and A. chukar
As I have recently written pretty fully on these two species in our
magazine (Goodwin, 1986a and 1986b) I will not say much more here.
Recent information suggests, I am sorry to say, that most birds now ex-
tant in England are hybrids. Sporting interests are also applying for a
further extension of official permission (which otherwise expires in Octo-
ber 1988) to release unlimited numbers of Chukars and hybrids yearly.
So there seems to be very little hope of the continued existence of A.
rufa, or its phenotypes, in Britain or, for that matter, in France or nor-
thern Spain. I have, however, heard on good authority (T. Gullick, pers.
comm ) that in central and southern Spain there has, so far, been little or
no introduction of Chukars and the partridges which there exist in appre-
ciable numbers are all pure Redlegs.
Capercaillie Tetrao urogallus
This very large and handsome woodland grouse became extinct in
Scotland (and Ireland) in the late 1700s, presumably owing to deforesta-
tion and human persecution.
It was successfully re-introduced in the early part of the 19th cen-
tury, notably by Lord Breadalbane at Aberfeldy in Perthshire. Although
in the 1950s and 60s it was regarded as 'vermin' by forestry interests,
because of its eating pine shoots and needles, it is now regarded as a val-
uable 'sporting bird' and shot for pleasure and the profit of those letting
the shooting rights. It has, not surprisingly, declined in numbers over the
past few decades and may well decline still more now that it has Goshawks
as well as foresters and sportsmen to contend with.

Like its smaller and even handsomer congener, the Black Grouse, it has
also declined greatly through much of its world range (Moss) so that it will
be a pity, on conservational as well as aesthetic grounds, should it again
become extinct in Britain, as it probably will.
Little Owl Athene noctua
We owe the presence of this delightful small owl, with its squat figure,
piercing pale yellow eyes and bobbing postures, to many people, some of
them aviculturists who went to much expense and trouble to introduce it
in the latter part of the 19th century (Lever; Sharrock).
Now, as with other long-ago introduced species, the Little Owl is gen-
erally accepted as a desirable addition to our fauna, but I am old enough
to remember when the outcry against it was similar to but greater than
the fulminations now emitted against the Rose-ringed Parrakeet. It was
accused of wholesale slaughter of gamebirds and songbirds and the find-
ings, of a meticulously careful scientific enquiry, that it fed, on the whole,
mainly on invertebrates and small mammals, was dismissed scornfully as
'whitewashing by the paper naturalists'.
It has decreased much since its hey-day in the late 1930s, probably
mainly as a result of our worsening climate, possibly also to changed
farming methods and destruction of old trees in parks and farmlands, but
is still not uncommon in some areas of lowland Britain. Although welcome
on aesthetic grounds, the tiny British population is of no conservational
interest as the species is found in central and southern Europe, Asia and
north Africa and is abundant in many parts of this wide range.

This handsome and hardy parrakeet was put on the 'British List' as
recently as 1983, as a Category C species, that is 'an established feral
bird which is self-maintaining'. This I fear may yet prove to be an over-
optimistic assumption, at least from the point of view of those who
welcome this beautiful and very 'different' addition to our avifauna. One,
moreover, that does not, like the Golden and Amherst Pheasants, tend to
dwell in distant and often private woodlands but shows itself conspicu-
ously and freely in suburbs and human-frequented parts of the 'Green
Belt' around London.
Our local population, about which I wrote in our magazine (Goodwin,
1983) has since sadly dwindled. For the past 18 months I have never seen
more than three individuals at one time and for the past two months
never more than one. However, it appears (Hawkes, in Lack) that the
bird is still present in many London suburbs, in south-eastern Kent and
sporadically elsewhere. Hawkes estimates about 1,000 birds but suggests

<bodyText confidence="0.998086346153846" page_id="56240706"  page_num="236" year="" vol="">
that the species 'is under recorded'. My own opinion is that most estimators
of birds' numbers tend to over-estimate them and that this is especially
the case when noisy, conspicuous birds such as parrakeets, woodpeckers
or jays are involved. When there were at most about 24 Rose-ringed Parra-
keets in my area I heard their numbers grossly over-estimated on several
occasions. One official solemnly assured me that there was a flock of 200
or more in one wood and the same in another. Not wanting to get myself
in officialdom's bad books, I felt it wiser, if uncourageous, not to contra-
dict this absurd statement.*
In contrast to the drooling delight of some ornithologists (falconers
manque?) over the re-introduction of the Goshawk, some of them have
taken a very dim view of this lovely newcomer, stressing its potential
ability to damage crops and giving the impression that they would like
officialdom to start a campaign against it.
Though its beauty and its membership of a family of birds not other-
wise found in a free state here made the Rose-ringed Parrakeet an acqui-
sition to our avifauna, like the Little Owl it has large populations in its
natural range (in its case in India and Africa) so that self interest rather
than conservational reasons must prompt us to welcome and help it here.
Whatever it may do in the way of making a nuisance of itself to third
world peasant farmers without firearms or modern poisons, it is very
unlikely that it could be more than a minor nuisance here or could not
soon be exterminated if it were.
*1 am pleased to say that in the past month I have seen seven, and a
friend of mine eight Rose-ringed Parrakeets locally (written 24th Novem-
ber 1987).

The first successful European breeding of a Kiwi occurred at Frankfurt
Zoo (West Germany) this year - after nearly a decade of trying. A pair
which arrived there from New Zealand in 1978 produced only infertile
eggs. In 1984 another two were obtained from the National Kiwi Centre
in Otorohanga.
Usually Kiwis can be sexed by the heavier weight of the female and by
her longer, more curved beak. However, the second pair could not be
sexed with certainty using this method. Wilhelma Zoo (Stuttgart) were
also uncertain of the sex of their Kiwis so each zoo exchanged one bird
in March 1986.
Last autumn the male hatched a chick which died soon after. In Kiwis
only the male incubates. The female contributes what is perhaps the most
enormous egg relative to body size of any bird. An egg from a Kiwi laid
at the National Kiwi Centre weighed 415 g and measured 126 x 76 mm.
It represented over 19% of the female's post-laying weight.
At Frankfurt Zoo the female's second egg was laid on 15th January
and was placed in an incubator. It pipped after 64 days and hatched four
days later. The chick weighed 255 g.
Kiwi chicks have very large yolk sacs which nourish them for two
weeks after hatching. During this period they lose weight - and Frankfurt
Zoo's Kiwi dropped to 178 g before it started to gain weight. Food con-
sisted of small worms (similar to earthworms) and small beetles.

Dr. Brian Kendall writes:
I was saddened to learn of the death, some time ago in Western Austra-
lia, of Tom Spence, aviculturist, naturalist and member of this Society
since 1952.
He and I became colleagues and friends at the Central Veterinary Labo-
ratory in the immediate post-war years and we joined the Avicultural
Society at around the same time. Tom had qualified as a veterinarian at
Edinburgh in 1943 but he had some additional training and worked as a
veterinary entomologist at the Laboratory at Weybridge covering also the
parasitic ticks and mites responsible for animal disease and we briefly
collaborated in work on a tick-transmitted disease of cattle. After a few
years at Weybridge, following his father's death, Tom resigned to take
over the family business and farms in Fife, Scotland. His next move was to
be Director of the Zoo at Perth, Western Australia, where he remained

until shortly before his death in 1985. I remember a somewhat liquid
farewell dinner before he left for Australia and two or three ecstatic
letters after he arrived. Thereafter, correspondence waned although I
did have a long and characteristic letter from him in 1983.
My friendship with Tom essentially covered the years when he was at
Weybridge and had a small collection of birds at Send and those when he
lived at Dunbog in Fife and had an ever-increasing collection of miscel-
laneous livestock including cheetahs, which he took shopping in the back
of his car, and gibbons from which he contracted obscure helminth dis-
ease.
Tom was a good veterinary surgeon who applied his special training to
his hobby animals, something which I have usually failed to do. He was a
superb field naturalist, certainly the best I have ever met, and those who
had the good fortune to be entertained at Dunbog will remember him as a
thoughtful and generous host.
He was awarded the Society's Medal for the first breeding in Britain
of the Purple-capped Lory Lorius domicellus in 1954, and served as a
member of the Council of the Avicultural Society from 1960-64 inclu-
sive.
It is worth recording what I feel were the major events influencing his
life; firstly, his early meeting with J.C. Laidlay of Lindores, Fife, from
whom he acquired a life-long interest in wildfowl, and secondly a sabbati-
cal year in Australia when he developed a love for the country from which
he never recovered.

Several very interesting reports of apparent first British breedings have

future issues of the Magazine. They include the Collared Sunbird Anthrep-

Pied Imperial Pigeon Ducula luctuosa by Mr. and Mrs. J. Ridgeway. The
Ridgeways have also prepared an account of their breeding in 1984 of the
Coleto Mynah Sarcops calvus which is believed to have been the first time
this species was bred in Britain; Mr. R.F. Rayner bred this species in 1985
and wrote an account of this in the Avicultural Magazine (1986, No. 1,

breeding programme. The total population recorded was 110 on 31st
December, compared to 101 at the end of 1985, but it is pointed out that
much of this increase is due to imports rather than to breeding success and
that the population cannot be regarded as self-sustaining at present. The
Stud Book is in two sections: firstly, a complete historical list of the
British population in Stud Book number order; secondly, a list of all living
individuals in alphabetical order of their present location.
We have been asked to encourage those of our members who keep
these birds to make a return for 1987 and requests for questionnaire forms
and any other enquiries about the Stud Book should be addressed to
Dr. Georgina Mace, The National Federation of Zoological Gardens of
Great Britain and Ireland, c/o The Institute of Zoology, Regent's Park,
London NW1 4RY (Telephone 01-722 3333). Even if members are not
interested in participating in any co-operative breeding programme, it
would be useful for the Stud Book to have information on their birds, as
it provides valuable baseline data about the genetic history of the British
population and about rates of breeding and survival. (Ed.)

What is the world's most abundant bird species?
In the Avicultural Magazine (Vol. 93, 1987, No. 2) I was interested to
read of the Sooty Shearwater Puffinus griseus and its estimated population
size of 'a thousand million'. This phenomenal number clearly made the
Shearwater a candidate for the world's most abundant bird species. But
surely this distinction belongs to the Red-billed Quelea Quelea quelea of
Africa - the feathered locust of our African savannas?
Twenty years ago, at a Symposium of the Institute of Biology, J.H.
Cook and P. Ward suggested that the total Quelea population of Africa
might be between one thousand million and one hundred thousand million
Since then, of course, there has been a terrific expansion in the production
of small-grain crops such as wheat, rice, sorghum and millets, and also in
irrigation of winter crops. In Zimbabwe, for example, we now crop about
40,000 hectares of irrigated winter wheat, when 20 years ago we cropped
only 1,000 ha. More crops, especially winter crops (when natural grass
seed is in short supply), probably mean more birds.
In 1985 we killed an estimated 120 million Queleas in crop protection
operations in winter. I assume that this number was one-half (or less) of
the total population in Zimbabwe at that time. Twenty-two countries in

sub-Saharan Africa have a Quelea problem, and our proportion of this
area is perhaps 6%. Could this suggest that the Red-billed Quelea numbered
four thousand million?
However, the Quelea population fluctuates dramatically from year to
year; in a good rainy season it could increase four-fold through reproduc-
tion. No doubt the numbers of the Sooty Shearwater are very stable by
contrast.

The Problem of the Penny-Slamming Cariama
Aviculture has always been of value in the study and understanding
of bird behaviour. Apart from the obvious advantages of close observa-
tion, the fact that a bird will try to carry out innate patterns of behaviour
in circumstances that are not ideal for it, while this is undoubtedly annoy-
ing for the bird, may provide useful clues about the origin and functions of
some aspects .of its behaviour.
In the 1960s I used to make use of the then greater variety of birds at
the London Zoo in studying comparative aspects of bird behaviour. On a
number of occasions I had the pleasure of seeing some of the collection
in the company of John Yealland who was at that time Curator of Birds.
On one such occasion we visited a row of aviaries where a number of
larger birds were kept, including a Cariama or Red-legged Seriama Cariama
cristata. This is one of the odd birds of the crane and rail order Gruiformes
and looks something like a long-legged and overgrown wader. It is mainly
terrestrial in habits. It has a short, stout and slightly curved bill, carried
with the head uptilted to give it a slightly supercilious expression that is
enhanced by the upstanding tuft of bristly feathers on the forehead.
John commented that it had a rather odd habit. He produced a penny.
I suppose one should explain that the old penny was a bronze coin about
3 cms in diameter, close in size to our present lOp piece. He offered the
penny to the Cariama, which seized it. It walked a few steps, abruptly
reared up and threw its head well back, then brought it forward suddenly,
releasing the penny which was slammed down on the concrete floor of the
aviary so hard that it ricochetted across it. The bird hurried forward,
seized the coin again and repeated the process. We walked on to inspect
the other aviaries with the distant sound of a coin repeatedly ringing
against concrete.
Presumably there is something that the Cariama usually encounters in

in the new meeting hall at the Society's headquarters at Warren Hill,
Hartley Wintney, and despite its unfinished state, the accommodation is
very spacious and proved well suited to meetings such as this.
After a buffet lunch, Mr. David Alderton gave a very interesting talk
entitled 'Aviculture: Does it have a Future?'. Mr. Alderton, who is a
member of the Council of the Avicultural Society and the author of
several books on aviculture, made many very apposite points about the
role of aviculturists in the future and a most stimulating discussion with
the audience followed. The talk was illustrated by some very beautiful
slides taken by the well-known bird photographer, Tony Tilford.
We would like to thank Mr. Alderton and Mr. Tilford for giving us such
an interesting lecture.

Sunday, 5th June, 1988 - President's Garden Party at Chestnut Lodge,
Cobharn, Surrey, by kind invitation of Miss Ruth Ezra and Mr. Raymond
Sawyer.
A meeting will be held at Hartley Wintney in October 1988, on a
date yet to be fixed.
It has proved very difficult to fix a date for a dinner and that arranged
for 12th December had to be abandoned as it clashed with the National
Show which many of our members attend. We are now hoping to arrange
a dinner for a Saturday night in June or July 1988, in London, and will
announce details as soon as known.

The death of Jean Delacour left a gap in my life and in the lives of so
many others that no one can ever fill.
I had known him all my life, in fact he knew my father before his mar-
riage in 1918 when my father was living in London in a flat in Mount
Street, Mayfair. They were devoted friends, both being interested in avi-
culture and his visits to our home at Foxwarren Park, Cobham, were looked
forward to greatly. My father was thrilled to hear about Jean's many
foreign trips. He also came regularly to No. 17 Knightsbridge, our London
home, and we all loved seeing him as, in addition to his great knowledge
and love of life, he had a great sense of humour which enabled him to
make friends with many people. He never forgot funny little incidents
or remarks that amused him, however long ago they had happened.
Apart from his life of travel and collecting for his fine chateau at
Cleres, near Rouen, he was also keenly interesed in pictures and music and
had a fine voice. He had been trained as an opera singer and though he
found Bach, Beethoven and Brahms very boring, he loved the music of
Russian composers such as Moussorgsky, especially his opera Boris God-
ounov. I well remember accompanying him on the piano as he sang fav-
ourite arias at musical gatherings in our home. He was a man of towering
structure, in appearance rather like Winston Churchill.
His widespread knowledge of birds can be read in his many books and
he was also a great authority on plants, knowing not only their natural
history but also who first discovered them and how they were established
in horticulture.
Twice in his life he lost his home. When he returned from World War I
he found the family chateau and aviaries at Villers, near Amiens, had been

completely destroyed and he then bought the Chateau of Cleres. During
the winter of 1919 he employed over one hundred men who lived under
canvas whilst they dug the lake and made the aviaries, enclosures and gar-
dens ready to move all the birds into by the spring. This work was comple-
ted in six months, mainly by hand as there were few mechanical aids then -
an amazing feat when one considers the difficulties of creating a park now.
Unfortunately Cleres was very badly damaged in World War II and had to
be recreated when Jean returned there from America after the war.
Raymond Sawyer and 1 enjoyed many visits to Cleres, sometimes ac-
companied by Dr. Edward Hindle and Miss Phyllis Barclay-Smith (editor
of the Avicultural Magazine from 1939 to 1973). Being a Frenchman by
birth (he took American citizenship after the Second World War) he was a
great connoisseur of food and drink and we all enjoyed the fine wines and
wonderful meals provided by his excellent French housekeeper. One of the
most beautiful views there was from the chateau looking down on to the
wonderful collection of waterfowl on the lakes. There were also many
tastefully planted aviaries which over the years housed so many rare birds
collected by Jean. In the early evening, when the park had closed to the
public, we used to walk around the grounds and sit by the lake. The herds
of Blackbuck and wallabies and various tame waterfowl would appear and
come up to be fed by Jean on pieces of bread that he pulled from his
pocket. A beautiful and peaceful scene that remains one of our most
lasting and treasured memories.
When we started our collection here at Chestnut Fodge in 1971, Jean
Delacour continued his stays with us whenever he came to England, at
least once a year. When he arrived he would ask, 'What are we going to do
this year?', as though he were building his own collection again at Cleres,
then long completed. Even towards the end of his life it was hard to realise
when talking with him, that he was well into his nineties, such was his
youthful enthusiasm.
Jean Delacour was the avicultural ambassador to the world, being the
great link between ornithology and aviculture. In Fondon in 1922 he was a
co-founder of the International Council for Bird Preservation which has
achieved so much for international bird protection, and was its President
from 1938 to 1958.
All his life he was the Avicultural Society's greatest supporter and
publicist. He loved being its President and used to attend meetings when-
ever possible. Not only was he a member for longer than anyone else,
from 1916 until his death, but he must also have contributed the most
articles to the Avicultural Magazine .
I feel very honoured to have been elected President of the Avicultural
Society and unworthy to follow in the steps of such a great man.

By Dr. TIM LOVEL
(Andover, Hampshire)
Jean Delacour was born in September 1890 in Paris, in his parents'
apartment near the Opera. He used to recall that even if one lived in the
provinces, one went to Paris to be born and to die - the doctors in Paris
were better for both. Every year the family went from June to October
to the Chateau of Villers-Bretonneux, the family mansion near Amiens.
Here his grandmother had a pheasantry, an orchid house and a Chinese
pavilion where, at the age of two or three, Delacour remembered admiring
the Carolina and Mandarin ducks.
At the age of four or five, he was already crazy about birds and he had
an aviary in his Paris nursery where he kept canaries and finches. His
father, amused by his younger son's passion for birds, gave him the pheas-
antry at Villers and said he could do what he liked with it. His brother had
bantams, so Jean began at once to develop his interest in foreign birds. In
this he was not alone; the small town of Villers had at least 50 bird keepers
amongst its 3,500 citizens, who were so keen on their hobby that every
month a dealer would come with many large cages and baskets of Austra-
lian and Indian softbills and they would buy up the entire supply every
time.
After his father's death in 1905, his mother and his uncle as trustees
gave him money to build up his collection - they said they would rather
that he kept birds than an opera dancer! In those years before the First
World War his collection, particularly of pheasants and cranes, was one of
the largest in France. Fight years of military service came to distract him
from the birds, but still he managed to get home from the frontline on a
motor cycle to see how the gardener was caring for them.
In 1916-17 the Chateau was the headquarters of Marshal Foch, and
Jean well remembered letting himself in by the garden gate to his pheas-
antry, only to find Foch and Weygand sitting discussing the campaign
inside the largest aviary; apparently it was the only place in that head-
quarters where they could find peace for a private talk! To the Chateau
came important visitors and Jean recalled that one night Floyd-George and
Clemenceau gave him dinner at his own table; "Next night I gave them
dinner at the same table!'. Sadly, in the spring of 1918 the great German
offensive broke out all along the front; the Allies were forced to retreat
and the Chateau and park of Villers ended up in a No Man's Fand being
shelled by both sides, so that by the end of the campaign there was nothing

at all left.
The War ended and Jean determined to obtain a strictly scientific
training. He went for this to Professor Bertrand at Lille who was famous
for his accuracy and strictness. He would have no rich dilettantes about
him and ever after Jean was grateful to him for the discipline that he
imposed. There were no constraints to earn a living; 'In my day it was not
supposed to be nice to get more money'. The change from this enviable
situation was something always regretted by Jean. He felt that many a
good young man had been lost to ornithology because of the need to earn
a living.
It was also urgent to find a new home. He went to look at a place near
Rouen which would have been ideal, but it was on top of a hill and com-
pletely dry. Jean wanted water, so when the Chateau and Park of Cleres
was offered to him, he bought it at once. It had all the ingredients that he
required. In those days it was always the fashion in France to have an
English gardener and an English birdman, and so Jean imported Frank
Fooks, a man just two years younger than himself, who stayed in his
employment for 47 years. Together they built up the collection at Cleres
to be world-famous. Not only the birds, but the mammals, trees and other
plants all had to be the best, the most varied and the newest that could
be obtained. Jean always separated his scientific interest in all species from
his appreciation of their aesthetic qualities. When the Salvadori's Pheasant
was imported again a few years ago, he dismissed it with 'Well, no doubt
it is very good to have got it, but it is a most dull and boring bird!' No
doubt he loved to shock his audience with these outrageous remarks. Nor
were they confined to intimate gatherings. Many will remember listening
to a lengthy exposition of a paper by an earnest lady when from the back
of the hall came an unmistakeable voice, 'That woman is a fool' - pause -
then, with exquisite timing, 'and not even a good looking fool'.
Birds, plants and mammals flowed in from all over the world. Together
with Alfred Ezra and Spedan Lewis they sent collectors to get the best of
everything. The birds were also being bred plentifully all over Northern
Europe. Before 1914 he would recall that tragopans were reared in hun-
dreds. Cabot's were cheapest and cost #6, Temmincks #10 and Satyr #20.
The Western Tragopan would never breed in captivity although a few were
obtained. He brought in the first Blue Eared Pheasants, about 30 in all,
of which there were far more males than females, and distributed them
among his friends. So far as we know no more have ever been imported
from the wild since that time.
Together with Edward Hindie he went to a cold, wet, draughty expanse
of marshland called Slimbridge to advise Peter Scott whether it was
suitable for duck. They gave the enterprise their blessing and Jean was

always delighted to have been in at the birth of the Wildfowl Trust, and
also of the International Council for Bird Preservation, which he helped to
found just before the second war. He also strongly supported the hunters&amp;apos;
organisation, C.I.C., finding nothing paradoxical in conserving rare species
while shooting the common ones. Tt is nothing more than killing a chicken
for dinner, if a species is plentiful&amp;apos;, he said, Tt is unfortunate that man is
made that way, but he has to eat'.
In 1923 he went off on the first of his seven expeditions to Indo-China,
in which he made a comprehensive collection of the flora and fauna of the
entire country. In those days It was a very stable, prosperous country - Tt
was safer there in those days than France or England are now. Now it has
all gone back to savagery'. Together with Jabouille, the Resident in Quango
tri, he collected pheasants and many other species from all over the
country. Particularly important were the Crested Argus, the Edwards' and
the Imperial Pheasants from Northern Viet-Nam. 'You never saw them
in the wild although you could hear them calling quite close', he said,
'but you set traps and you could catch them immediately'. In obtaining
these birds alive and in good condition, he went to very great trouble.
'Never put down corn in front of your snares', he would say, 'for the birds
are then caught by the neck and killed. Set the traps unbaited and they
are caught by the foot and will live, at least until the wild cats get them.
Never let natives bring the pheasants In their baskets anywhere near the
village chickens or disease will invariably result'. His birds had to live up to
three months in cages and he found the high montane species particularly
difficult. At least pheasants would always eat well after capture, whereas
pigeons would totally refuse to eat and he would often have to cram a
pigeon for a month before it would eat spontaneously. The voyage from
Saigon to Marseilles took 25 days and the greatest care was needed to
bring all his captives safely to Europe.
Diseases were not the only hazard: he used to describe how, as his boat
came down the river into the harbour at Saigon, one of the cages fell open
and the female Imperial Pheasant, the only one ever captured alive, flew
out and skimmed low over the water Into the docks. Tt went into a ware-
house through the open doors and I had to wait in a fever of impatience
until my boat docked and then I rushed along the quay and slammed the
doors shut. The pheasant was roosting in the rafters and I had to pay a
native boy to climb up and catch her'. That bird and her mate were the
only ones ever brought to Europe and the whole captive stock descends
from that pair.
Jean wrote prodigiously about the many species of animal and plant
that he had studied. Apart from his monumental Pheasants of the World
and the smaller volume on keeping pheasants in captivity, he also wrote

with Dean Amadon the standard work on the Cracid family. His other
great contribution about gamebirds was on the Pheasants of the Genus
Lophura (Ibis, Volume 91, p. 188), where he brought order and under-
standing to that great sprawling group of ten species and dozens of sub-
species and local variations. He loved to see variations from the normal;
I remember him sitting for hours fascinated by the lavender mutation of
Sonnerat's Jungle Fowl which occurred in Iain Grahame's collection at
Daw's Hall, and his real delight when a pair of the pale mutation of the
Grey Partridge was put in his hand.
Jean was a polymath, with an interest in everything and everybody;
nothing escaped him and he could discourse on world politics, local
scandal, the arts and finance as easily as he could upon zoological topics,
and yet he was despondent for the future of the planet. There are too
many people, and not enough food - there is no escape from that', he
would say. But he had a solution: 'We need to decrease the number of
humans, and to increase the available protein, and therefore I am in
favour of cannibalism' - quick downward flap of the hands and that famous
ironic laugh - 'So long as 1 am not involved personally'.

JEAN DELACOUR, MY FRIEND

Jean Delacour and Dr. Henry Quinque, when visiting the author's home
in June 1980

Delacour's scientific work. On the contrary I would like to express my
modest witness, as a close and faithful friend of the great man we have
lost, to those who appreciated or loved him without having been able to
know him intimately.
Since my youth I had a boundless admiration for him because I knew
that he was an exceptional man. Then one day, alas now distant, he
accepted my invitation through a mutual friend, to spend a day at my

home.
The moment I saw this tall man, elegantly bald with deep blue eyes,
and heard him say but a few words, I realised that I had the good fortune
to meet one of those rare personalities who are the pride of a century. The
years that have passed have only confirmed my first impression.
A warm sympathy between us was born in these first few hours, and
with the passing of time I could not help remembering the saying of the
great 16th century French writer Michel de Montaigne, about his friend La
Boetie: 'If I was forced to say why I loved him, I would say that it is
because he was he and I was T. On that day I encountered a man whose
example has greatly influenced me.
My profession has enabled me to meet great scholars and scientists, but
Jean Delacour was something more than this: he was a man full of life, of
contrasts and of sponteneity. A man close to us all but possessing an
encyclopaedic mind and a curiosity like the men of the Renaissance.
His encyclopaedic mind
His interest in zoology is known to all but our readers will discover
later more hidden aspects of his personality which are even more exciting.
Ornithology was certainly his main aim in life. His scientific work was
always associated with his interest in the breeding of the most difficult
species. It is rare now to open an ornithological work in which his name
does not occur in the bibliography.
In 1948 Rene Ronsil, in his Bibliography of French Ornithology
recorded 227 books and papers in his name. At the time of his death this
figure exceeded 400 titles.
The birds he preferred were the waterfowl, pheasants, touracos, birds
of paradise and hummingbirds. Before the First World War he had already
reared many young touracos, and his mother used to write letters to him
at the front to give him news of his favourite birds. At the outbreak of the
Second World War he possessed the finest collection of waterfowl in the
world, as well as aviaries with numerous birds of paradise and humming-
bird tunnels.
Hummingbird tunnels were an invention of his own to enable these
wonderful but unfortunately very aggressive birds to live together. Inside
his aviaries he set up enclosures 10m long but no more than one metre
high and one metre wide, filled with exotic plants. In these enclosures the
birds lose their territorial instincts and 50 of them can live together
without harm.
During his expeditions in Indo-China in preparation for the work which
he wrote with Jabouille, Les Oiseaux de VIndochine Francaise, he had one
rather comical experience. In an expedition in Annam he was very keen to

see for the first time a living specimen of Rheinart's Crested Argus Pheasant
Rheinartia oceliata which he only knew from museum specimens. He
offered his Annamite collectors a considerable sum of money to bring him
a live Argus. After ten days of waiting in vain, he doubled his offer. In the
days that followed, first two, then five and finally tee live Argus Pheasants
were brought in, which obliged him to strike camp without delay before
the funds of his expedition were exhausted.
Much more recently he became interested in the birds of New Cale-
donia, a French territory in the South Pacific. He made two important
journeys there to study them in 1962 and 1964. He was horrified to learn
that the rarest birds of this endemic fauna, even those in danger of extinc-
tion, were being destroyed by shooting, by forest clearances and fires and
by domestic animals gone wild.
He decided then to write an accurate but simple handbook designed
especially for the local population. His aim was to save what could still be
saved by making those capable of understanding aware of their responsi-
bilities.
This little book cost him much work, but he was rewarded by its effect
on the conscience of the most responsible people of New Caledonia,
though they are unfortunately not the majority. Some of them did under-
stand, however, that the birds they used to see and sometimes eat were
disappearing, and that they existed only in this little territory of New
Caledonia and its neighbouring islands - a minute part of the world.
Unfortunately the destruction of these birds has not been stopped, but the
extent of it has at least declined. An ornithological society has been
founded in Noumea, as well as a zoological park which can help in the
desperate attempt to preserve the K.agu R.hvnocketos jubatus .
It would be desirable if the Guide aivc Oiseawc de la Nouvelle Caledonie
published in 1966, were to be reprinted. Unfortunately this would not be
a commercial success, because the sales of this fine little book, well illus-
trated by L. Sandford, did not cover the cost of printing, in spite of a
generous grant from an anonymous American. An English edition would
probably be more successful, at least so the author thought.
When one observes how scrupulously Jean Delacour quoted in his intro-
duction all the authors who had preceded him in the study of the fauna of
New Caledonia, it is shocking to see how a recent book on the subject, which
is nothing but a piracy of his work adorned with photographs, does not
mention his name except briefly in the bibliography at the end of the work.
Well before the publication of this work, Jean Delacour was interested in
the avifauna of New Caledonia, which is unique in its density and endemism
on such a small territory. It comprises no less than 116 species of which 91
are sedentary in an area of 20,000 squ. km. Of these, 20 species are endemic,

including exceptional birds such as the Kagu, sole species of the family Rhy-
nochetidae, the Horned Parrot of the genus Eunymphicus, E. cornutus cor-
nu tus being found on the mountains of the main island and Ex. uvaeensis
very localised on the north atoll of the little island of Uvea.
To this list of rare wonders must be added the pigeons, represented by
the giant Goliath Imperial Pigeon Ducula goliath , which is the largest pigeon
in the world that is capable of flight, though perhaps not for much longer,
the Metallic Pigeon Columha vitiensis hypoenochroa and finally that incom-
parable jewel, the Cloven-feathered Dove Drepanoptila holosericea.
For years Jean Delacour told me with enthusiasm about these marvellous
and endangered birds which he had seen in the natural environment in which
they had evolved. I shared his enthusiasm all the more readily because I had
maintained ornithological contacts with New Caledonia for over 35 years.
Thanks to the generosity and trust of the Government of New Caledonia
to which Jean Delacour had warmly recommended me, I was able to obtain
some of the most interesting birds of this region. Jean Delacour's delight
when I succeeded in breeding, one after the other, the Horned Parrot, the
Cloven-feathered Dove and the Metallic Pigeon is a precious memory for me.
He was all the more pleased because he saw here a means of saving these
birds which were on their way to extinction. Moreover, they had never
been bred in captivity before, even in their native land. However, both he and
I were much more doubtful about the possibility of breeding the unpredictable
Kagu in captivity in Europe.
A number of these birds had been imported during the past 80 years,
and even the best equipped zoos, notably that of Berlin, had only ex-
perienced failures. Jean Delacour even told me that it was almost a pity to
keep these extremely rare birds in captivity when it seemed impossible
that they would breed. This opinion only confirmed my determination to
analyse the reasons for my own lack of success. The day that my first
Kagu hatched was one of the greatest ornithological pleasures of my great
friend. It will naturally be in his honour that I shall shortly publish the
results of my successes in this field.
If ornithology was a main centre of interest for our friend, it was not
the only one. He was also seriously interested in Mammalogy.
His first encounter with gibbons was entirely accidental. One of his
French friends in Indo-China was accustomed to sending him live birds
from time to time. Imagine Jean Delacour's surprise when he received,
without warning, a pair of Black Gibbons. At that time he had a posi-
tive dislike of monkeys and immediately took steps to rid himself of these

unwelcome animals.
Their intelligence and behaviour, however, soon appealed to him, so
much so that their descendants still live and breed at Cleres. Dr. Delacour
even became one of the leading experts on the systematics of the Hylo-
batidae. These primates are extremely difficult to identify because the
same species vary in their fur from one region to another, from one sex to
the other and even from one period of life to another in the same indivi-
dual.
Early on a gibbon kept at liberty in the park at Cleres attacked a young
keeper and opened his abdomen from top to bottom with surgical preci-
sion. The wounded man was saved, but since then the gibbons have been
kept securely on the island in the lake. It is there that Suzy was born, a
charming female Black Gibbon H. concolor, who was attached to Jean
Delacour by a deep mutual affection for more than 30 years. He kept her
in complete liberty at the cost of some disagreements with his mother of
whom Suzy was jealous. She had a habit of dropping on Madame Dela-
cour's umbrella when she was on her way to Mass, and wiping her dirty
hands on her summer dress, with reactions which can be imagined. But
Suzy remained a favourite child and allowed her friend Jean to handle her
own infant when she became a mother.
Apart from the gibbons, the collection at Cleres boasted the first herd
of Sitatungas in Europe, not to mention Indian Blackbuck, Muntjacs and
numerous kangaroos, which were naturalised in Normandy for several
generations.
It is well known that Cleres in its prime was the finest private zoo in
the world. The collection of wildfowl included all the known species and
breeding successes were numerous. In order to achieve this Jean Delacour
maintained an association with the best collectors of the period, such as
Goodfellow and Frost, later also Charles Cordier, who is still with us and
who was the first to bring back the Congo Peafowl alive.
Jean Delacour was not only a scientist in systematic ornithology, he
was also an aviculturist of genius, able to make the most meticulous obser-
vations. He had also great practical ability, and was himself responsible
for planning the aviaries at the Chateau de Villers-Bretonneux and subse-
quently at Cleres.
Being at the same time a capable aviculturist and an exceedingly well-
informed scientist, he was able to make observations which would have
eluded most of us. On one occasion when we were walking beside my
duckpond, we saw a fine brood of Ringed Teal, freshly hatched, which
were swimming actively between their father and mother. He told me then
that among ducks of the northern hemisphere the mother alone looks after
the young, while among those of the southern hemisphere the male and

female together take care of their offspring. That day again I learned
something new.
Though his knowledge of zoology was so vast it was not Jean Delacour's
only interest. He was equally a botanist of professional standard and a
lover of plants as much as of animals. As a boy he spent the rewards he
received for his brilliant scholastic achievements on purchasing orchids
which he loved for the rest of his life. From each of his voyages he brought
back rare or simply beautiful plants as .souvenirs. Above all he loved cacti,
and the terrace of his private apartment at the Chateau de Cleres was
planted with them all along the wall which sheltered them from the cold.
He personally attended to his collection for many years and each autumn,
before leaving for England and the United States, he had his fine plants
protected by specially made glass frames.
He was also very fond of fuchsias which he kept in large bowls, and of
his old bonzai, a juniper I believe, which I always saw facing the dining
room, where it must have heard many interesting conversations during
its long life.
Ornithology, zoology in its widest sense, and botany known and prac-
tised to this extent would have filled the lives of several learned men, but
they did not suffice for Jean Delacour. If what has been mentioned above
is known to all, what follows is certainly known to few.
He was really like those great minds of the Renaissance, athirst for
uni versal knowledge. He was a great connoisseur of painting, music and
literature. He was familiar with all the schools of classical painting and
their great artists. He owned some very fine primitive paintings and care-
fully preserved the originals for the illustrations of his books. He could
draw well himself and a number of his illustrations were published, for
example, in his well-known treatise on aviculture. It is certainly less well-
known, owing to his reserve, that he was a fine classical singer of pro-
fessional standard. He had studied music and singing very seriously and
in his youth had considered making it a career, but zoology and social
considerations dissuaded him. His voice was harmonious and his accent
distinguished. His superb baritone voice, with its wide range, enchanted
the salons of his family friends in Paris, and he was often accompanied
by soloists of international reputation in his renderings of the songs of
Mozart and Schubert. He made light of the technical difficulties of com-

posers as sensitive as Saint-Saens, Faure and Gounod. When age affected
the quality of his voice, he gave up singing completely but he never lost
his love for classical music. On the other hand he had a feeling akin to
hatred for the cacophony called modern music, which he called the music
of savages.
His interest in book collecting was such that at the outbreak of the
Second World War he possessed all the works of John Gould and Francois
Levaillant, among many other treasures.
Fire destroyed all this great collection, and with advancing age he
gave up the acquisition of old books, of which the price was becoming
prohibitive. In his study at Cleres he kept, in an old cabinet from Indo-
China, only the books he himself had written and no others except those
which had been dedicated to him by their authors. He gave me all the few
remaining copies of his work on the birds of New Caledonia.
His knowledge of literature was as boundless as his knowledge of science.
We spent hours in discussion of literary classics and in appreciation of their
pleasures.
I remember his interest in the philosophy of Confucius whose opinions,
he maintained would be valid as long as there are civilised men. He liked
especially two fine quotations. Here is the first: 'Experience is a lamp
which one bears on one's back, and it only illuminates, alas, the path we
have already trod". Indeed, we reject in our youth the opinions of our
elders, only to accept them eventually as the fruit of our own errors.
The second thought of the great Chinese philosopher expressed for him
all the vanity of false knowledge. It is excellent. "One can talk with some-
one who knows, one can have a discussion with someohe who does not
know, but even Buddha could not manage to convince someone who
believes he knows".
Moreover, 1 think Jean Delacour's choice of Cleres in Normandy as his
home is evidence of his refined taste. There he was perfectly happy, sur-
rounded by the animals he loved, in a highly civilised environment. The
chateau, well-known at least from photographs, was splendid before the
fire which gutted the interior. The rooms, which have lately been adapted
for the reception of the public and the keeping of birds, were originally a
dining room and,drawing rooms decorated with tapestries and fine fabrics.
The furniture and the paintings were of the finest, and the library out-
standing. When he returned from the United States after the Second
World War, he found his chateau intact on the outside. But when, in the
company of a friend, he entered it, he discovered that everything was
reduced to ashes though still in its place and recognisable. The draught

made die curtains fall, the doors of the wardrobe in his bedroom collapsed
and his clothes vanished into the dust when he touched them. The fine
books still stood on the blackened shelves in the library, but at the touch
of a finger they collapsed in ashes. Only Gould's Monograph of the Tro-
gons still remained as a book in all this delusion. It was given to Rene
Ronsil, the librarian of the Societe Ornithologique de France, who re-
stored it to the best of his ability, carefully mounting the surviving plates
on fresh paper, and kept it as a cherished souvenir until his death.
One can imagine what an experience this was for Jean Delacour. But he
did not give up. He had the main chateau restored to the condition in
which we know it today and moved into outbuildings which are even
more ancient and of great beauty.
We have ourselves spent memorable occasions in the drawing room
and the dining room formed in the circular gallery overhanging the draw-
ing room, beneath a marvellous coffered ceiling with huge beams painted
with richly coloured floral designs.
In his advanced age the master of this dwelling lived mostly in his
room on the ground floor, unfortunately rather damp, surrounded by
furniture of the last century which he had brought back from Indo-China.
His view of society
The fortunate circumstances of his birth would have allowed Jean
Delacour to pass his life in gilded idleness. His parents lived in the mag-
nificent Chateau de Villers-Bretonneux, and his grandmother on a superb
estate at Neuilly, to which she introduced dromedaries and elephants
hired from the zoo for the amusement of Jean and his brothers. Yet he
was a man who worked unceasingly all his life just for the pleasure of
acquiring knowledge.
He who was so well acquainted with nature and with life believed that
the egalitarianism preached by a certain political ideology is a snare and
a delusion. No living being is identical with another though each has his
place in human or in animal societies. He had the wisdom to respect
every individual, but much more those who deserved respect for their
efforts and the quality of their personality.
One summer evening we were exchanging our views, seated in com-
fort on the terrace outside his apartment. Before us were the two fine
little pools which had been made for goldfish and water plants. "Look
at these fish", he said, "they are more intelligent than most human beings.
When first put here they multiplied very rapidly up to their present
number. After that they ceased to multiply. It is a great pity that human
beings do not have their good sense, but multiply faster than they can
feed themselves, hastening to their inevitable destruction. Human societies,

Dr. H. Quinque
Jean Delacour talking with the author at Cleres, August 1982
with the exception of a nucleus of the international elite, are in com-
plete decline. The decline of the Roman Empire extended over 250 years.
If our moral laxity continues only a few more years will see the disap-
pearance of the advanced civilisations in favour of the most brutish mater-
ialism. Do you remember Paul Valery's words of warning: 'Decadence
comes from a satiety with goodness and an appetite for the bizarre.' We
have already passed the stage of the bizarre". In spite of this clearly cyni-
cal language, I know that he still had confidence in the ability of res-
ponsible and far-sighted men to take up the torch of civilisation.
Jean Delacour shared his life and his heart between France, England
and the United States. When he returned each spring from the Anglo-
Saxon countries he praised their merits and even maintained a preference
for them over France. I suspect that he had the opposite opinions in
London or Los Angeles but kept them to himself in politeness to his
hosts. He was a citizen of the world. It was a point of honour for him to
write his English works directly in that language without any help or
correction, and in doing so he never dictated to a secretary but wrote
everything in his own hand.

On the subject of aviculture he used to say that no publication in the
world was equal to the Avicultural Magazine . He had much appreciated
Miss Phyllis Barclay-Smith CBE, Honorary Editor from 1939 to 1973, and
had the highest regard for our present Honorary Editor, Mrs. Mary Har-
vey, for her complete devotion to our journal in a period of great difficul-
ties.
He was most faithful in his friendships and his affections, though a
great modesty prevented the expression of his feelings. The death of one
of his two brothers at an early age wounded him for life. The death of
his mother, who lived with him in Los Angeles, at the age of 95, affected
him deeply and he often spoke of her. They are now both buried in Cali-
fornia, far from their native land.
He enjoyed the company of hundreds of worthy friends and carefully
avoided others. Among those whose names are familiar to me, I know that
Alfred Ezra was a great friend, followed by his daughter Miss Ruth Ezra,
who is now our President. He spoke of her with warm sympathy, as also of
our friend Raymond Sawyer; the former Duke of Bedford; his friend
Jabouille, who was Governor of French Indo-China at the time they wrote
their work on the birds of that country together; Aime Decoux, a fine
man of letters and ornithologist, as well as Professor Berlioz and many
other great names were counted among his friends. More recently, he
enjoyed the devotion of the director of the park at Cleres, Dr. Ciarpag-
lini and his wife, as well as of the Schreibers, the well-known ornitholo-
gists of the Los Angeles Museum.
His personality and character
A superior intelligence, an exceptional fund of knowledge, boundless
culture and a gift for words made Jean Delacour a superb host. One
could remain far into the night charmed by his conversation. When he
spoke of South America, the Pacific, or Asia, it was as if one followed
him through the forests or on the rivers in search of unknown birds. In
spite of his great knowledge he never monopolised the conversation at the
expense of others.
I believe that a large part of his heart had remained in French Indo-
China. He often spoke of that ancient civilisation with its respect for
symbolic values. He loved to tell of the pleasure of meeting a simple
peasant working the paddy field with his buffalo who would greet you
with a traditional courtesy that was exquisite and respectful. These people
preserved the customs of their ancient civilisation; for example, a man did
not allow his beard to grow until he was the grandfather of three male
children. The memory of these details pleased Jean Delacour all the more
when political materialism had swept them nearly all away.

He never returned to the French overseas territories after their inde-
pendence, which he felt had had disastrous results, in most cases. He
preferred to keep his memories unsullied and to avoid what he thought of
as political lunacies.
He kept his memory in training all his life, as an athlete trains his
muscles; and when the time came that his legs could no longer support
his body properly, his intelligence and his memory were still as bright as
ever. One summer Sunday a few years ago, I had invited two or three
professional ornithologists to meet him at my home, one of whom, a
mutual friend, was professor at the Paris Museum. In the morning while
Jean Delacour was resting in his room we began to visit the aviaries. None
of us was able to remember the Latin name of one bird in particular,
though it was quite a well known species. It evaded all our efforts. When
Jean Delacour joined us for the afternoon visit, he turned to me and said
simply, &amp;apos;You have a fine male Chlorophanes spiza. He was then 93 years
old. He was a splendid guest, who always had an agreeable compliment
for the lady of the house and a regard for the staff.
In fact, this great scholar remained at heart a simple man, which added
greatly to his charm. He simply loved life; he appreciated good food and
the beauty of a table well laid. His wide education did not prevent him
from holding decided opinions and in certain matters he made known his
likes and dislikes. Though he was never aggressive, he could react with
vigour if he was attacked.
One professional ornithologist attached to a great museum of inter-
national reputation had gradually become his enemy and did not con-
ceal the fact, either in private or in print. One day it became well known
that this man's wife was leading a double life. Jean Delacour remarked,
"X's wife is deceiving him, it's a proof of the existence of God". This
saying hit the nail on the head.
As with human beings, so with animals. He had his preferences and
though he loved almost all of them, he found some less attractive. For
example, he found tortoises stupid, dwarf flamingos disfigured by their
&amp;apos;big noses' and the lovely bustards stupid and bad natured. On the other
hand he loved enormously Suzy whom I have already mentioned, his old
male Cereopsis Goose and my aged &quot;Noiraud", a Palm Cockatoo who lived
in complete liberty at my home for more than 30 years, and whom Jean
Delacour had known since 1925 when he was imported by a mutual friend.
In the matter of food he had also fixed opinions. He had a weakness for
Crustacea, duck a la rouennaise, foie gras, great wines and old champagne,
which alternated from time to time with the mineral water which he made
himself drink every day. We both shared a love of chocolate. On the other
hand he detested mackerel in white wine, pigeon and sweet-breads; al-

though with this last my wife caught him sometimes with culinary snares.
His company was appreciated throughout the world
Those of us who were honoured by his friendship and even his affec-
tion appreciate that his company was sought by the great of this world.
The greatest scientists enjoyed meeting him. European statesmen received
him personally to benefit from his advice in the creation of zoological
parks.
He was a close friend of the old Duke of Bedford, with whom he dined
often at Woburn Abbey. Japanese princes were his friends. One day the
Emperor of Japan received him personally for a strange duck hunt. To-
gether with some friends of the Emperor, Jean Delacour was provided
with a large net to catch the ducks at the moment when they rose in
flight from small, specially constructed waterways. After this, the guests
enjoyed the fillets of duck roasted on a wood fire. This day remained alive
in his memory, especially because he was later received in his private study
by the Emperor, who showed him his vast collection of marine worms, a
group of which he is one of the great experts.
In conclusion
Jean Delacour worked all his life for the animals he loved so well. Early
in his life he wrote some glowing words about them with the impetuosity
of youth, for example, in the account of his first voyage to the Caribbean.
He showed the same devotion to his human friends, with kindness,
good humour and constancy. He was the best friend one could imagine.
In advanced years he declared to me: "What makes me despair is that I
cannot interest myself in anything, I am too old". Yet right up to his
death he remained appreciative of respect and sympathy.
At the beginning of 1983, Mr. G.L. Schulman, President of the I.F.C.B.
organised a great international meeting in Los Angeles - The Jean Delacour
Symposium. His efforts were worthy of gratitude for he gave our old
friend one of his last happy public experiences. There were 50 speakers
from 27 different countries. When it was my turn to speak, Jean Delacour,
though tired, left his apartment and came in his wheelchair to help me,
fearing my uncertain English would not be equal to the questions that
were put at the conclusion of my speech. The final day of the congress
ended with a banquet for 700 guests. Jean Delacour thanked the assembled
company with a graceful speech of appreciation, his voice charged with
emotion. He told me afterwards how happy he was.

The last letter I received from him was distressing. He knew that he
was about to die and said so without complaint. "I can write no more to
you", he wrote in a faltering hand, "My hand is getting paralysed and can
no longer hold the pen".
Then he left our world in dignity, a burden to no one, vanquished by
time and death which ends all good things. He has left us a magnificent
example of courage in beginning his life again twice when most people
would have given up.
He has left also an example of generosity in bequeathing all his pos-
sessions to the Natural History Museum in Paris, which has set up at
Cleres the Jean Delacour Foundation. Few men of his quality are pro-
duced in any century, and future centuries will see even fewer.
Above all he was a warm and faithful friend, whom one will always
be proud to have known.
Farewell then, Sir. Our thanks for your time among us and the great
example you have given us.
I would like to thank Mr. Howard Swann, Chairman of Wheldon and Wesley,
for his sensitive translation of this article.

By PROFESSOR S. DILLON RIPLEY
(Secretary Emeritus - The National Museum of Natural History,
Smithsonian Institution, Washington D.C., USA)
Jean Delacour first came into my acquaintance in 1936, when I was
still an undergraduate at Yale University. I frequented the American Mus-
eum of Natural History quite often during those days as, in spite of my
designation as a potential lawyer (and majoring in history at the Univer-
sity), I took a good deal of time to stay in New York where my family
lived and to drop back and forth to the Bird Department of the American
Museum of Natural History. I was anxious to learn more about birds and
to encourage my new friends in the bird field to help me out.
Someone mentioned that the great Mr. Delacour was going to be in
Dr. Chapman's office for a few days en route from the Caribbean on his
way to France and his office there at the Chateau de Cl&amp;res, and so I met
the great man. I do not recall whether we had corresponded beforehand,
but as I was already quite keenly involved with keeping waterfowl in
Litchfield, Connecticut, on our summer place, I believe that perhaps I had
written to him in one way or another because of his noted collections of
all sorts of birds and mammals on the grounds and park of the Chateau.
Mr. Delacour turned out to be very jolly and pleasant, with the highly
refined manners of a French gentleman on first meeting a stranger - even
though the stranger was friendly and eager to make his acquaintance. In
those days one was aware that on First meeting such illustrious people
there was an innate sense of reserve expressed in their manner and appear-
ance, giving them a protective armour in case the new acquaintance turned
out to be a boor, or pressing too much for some fancied advantage, or
seeking out some gift, or discourse that would be tedious for the personage
involved.
Gradually, as the conversation went on, Mr. Delacour relaxed and
seemed to enjoy reminiscing about his trip through the Caribbean on the
yacht with Lord Moyne and Lady Moya Beresford. I forget the other
members of the house party on the large ocean-going yacht of Lord Moyne
but they had stopped off to see friends (who later became significant parts
of our lives, the Phelps, Senior and Junior, the bird luminaries of Venezuela)
and I gathered that the trip, including visits to various islands in the Carib-
bean, had been pleasant and rewarding.
After graduation, I myself embarked on expeditions for nearly three
years, until the late autumn of 1939 when I returned from my second long

expedition to Indonesia and the' Southwest Pacific, During this time, I cor-
responded briefly with Delacour on subjects which I thought would interest
him, such as birds of paradise in New Guinea, or unusual pheasants seen in
zoos, or in the wild state in Sumatra, or among the bird dealers of Singa-
pore, but it was not really until after the war that my wife and I were able
to visit him at Cleres.
The onset of hostilities provoked a violent change in Delacour's life. It
was not long into the 1940s when he and his mother appeared in New
York City, under very different conditions from our first meeting. In this
case, he was anxiously seeking an apartment or somewhere where his much
older mother could live and at the same time find an outlet for himself in
the world of ornithology and aviculture. By fortunate coincidence, Ms long-
time friendship with William Beebe, the famous explorer-naturalist, asso-
ciated with the New York Zoological Society, led him to receive the offer
of a position in that Society concerned with the Bronx Zoo. The position
became Jean's first job! He had been asked by Fairfield Osborn, the Presi-
dent of the Zoological Society, to take over the design and advise on the
aesthetics of new quarters for mammals and birds. Delacour, of course,
was the foremost exponent in those days of the new art of zoo landscape.
The breakaway from the stated cast iron bars of cages, the creation of
diorama-like effects in open pens with concealed moats, the presentation
of birds with plants intermixed to create a garden-like atmosphere, even
though behind wire mesh, was all a new subject. First started in Germany
under the Heinroths, and carried out by Delacour himself in the design of
the new zoo at the Parc de Vincennes, created for the French Exposition
on Indochina in 1937, made a vast impression on the world of zoological
parks. Similar work was undergoing in Antwerp, in Switzerland and in a
host of other zoos, many of them in the United States and some in Canada
and Brazil, but the effort of remodelling older buildings and creating new
park-like landscape facilities was still alien to the zoo profession. It would
be a number of years, including the technological advantages of new
materials after World War II, before zoos would begin to coalesce in the
feelings of open air, landscape space, and the intrusion of plants, formerly
confined to botanical, gardens, into the milieu of the zoos.
Delacour could thus certainly claim the principal credit for the renova-
tions undertaken at the Bronx Zoo during World War IT He was in the
forefront, not only in designing and landscaping the facilities, but also
helping to select the choices of birds and mammals as well as reptiles to be
shown in such quarters most successfully, with a view to their maintenance
as well as their aesthetic appeal At the same time, Jean found himself
immersed in systematic studies at the American Museum of Natural His-
tory, and until I went overseas in the early summer of 1943 (plunged into

war work which would last until the latter part of 1945) I saw a good deal
of him on my visits to New York from graduate school at Harvard or from
Washington.
Many visits to the Delacours' apartment and later to the Stanhope
Hotel, where they settled, meant that our friendship flourished. We found
ourselves at home on subjects as various as the habits of rhinoceroses in
Southeast Asia to pheasants and waterfowl around the world. Delacour
made a large and happy circle of friends in New York during this time and
soon joined the Knickerbocker Club, as well as the Century, so that our
interchanges became very frequent on a social level, as well as keen discus-
sions interspersed on the subject of ornithology associated with the new
systematics, as proposed by Julian Huxley, Theodosius Dobzhansky, and
closely followed by the outstanding American ornithologist, Ernst Mayr,
himself a relatively recent arrival from Germany.
Before going overseas I sought out Delacour's advice on possible people
with whom I could be in touch on my travels abroad for the Office of
Strategic Services. Sure enough, Lord Moyne had now become Prime
Minister Churchill's personal representative in Egypt. Lord Linlithgow, the
Viceroy of India, was a more distant friend, but certainly not unknown to
Delacour. Then there was the Ezra family, originally from Calcutta, where
Sir David Ezra still presided, but with close relatives in England in the
person of 'Chips' Ezra, at Foxwarren Park in Surrey. An additional close
friend of Delacour's whom I had not so far met was Phyllis Barclay-Smith,
the honorary secretary of the International Council for Bird Preservation,
and a revered figure in the world of aviculture.
The Avicultural Society, which he joined in 1916, loomed large in
Delacour's mind and he continued to be deeply involved in promoting and
cultivating exhibitions, friendships and interchanges through that Society
with many foreign ornithologists. I had the good fortune, en route out to
the Far East in my new job, to meet a group of the pillars of the Avicul-
tural Society such as Phyllis, MissKnobel, David Seth-Smith, Spedan Lewis
and his curator (of the Leckford Estates) Terry Jones, during the few
weeks that I passed in London. A visit to Foxwarren Park was a revelation
to me in the manner and style in which mammals and birds could be kept
in concert with people in an open collection. Mr. Ezra and his family were
enchantingly friendly and nice to the young ornithologist (I was delighted
when I learned that Miss Ruth Ezra had succeeded Jean Delacour as
President of the Avicultural Society).
En route to India I stopped in Cairo and made the acquaintance of
Lord Moyne, only a few weeks before he was cruelly assassinated. Further
east, in India, I made the best of additional notes and letters to such
persons as Sir David Ezra in Calcutta, and Dr. Satya Churn Law, the pre-

eminent aviculturist at that time in eastern India.
In subsequent years, Delacour and I became much closer, especially
after I was married, appointed to the faculty at Yale, and found myself
near enough to New York to be able to share visits with him and with
Mary, my wife, at numerous conferences and meetings. International
activities allowed me to become more active in the International Council
for Bird Preservation, to which I was elected, becoming President in 1958
to succeed Delacour himself, and I continued that association right up
until 1982 when I retired and, like Dr. Delacour, became an Emeritus
President.
In the 1950s and 1960s we took several trips together in connection
with conservation. Mary always accompanied us and became just as
devoted to Jean as I was. We stayed often at Cleres in those days, and will
never forget the fascinating sensation of waking up in the guest room of
the Chateau, over Jean's room, and listening to the early morning sounds
of the awakening park inhabitants. There were the shrill, almost falsetto-
like dawn chorus of the gibbons, the occasional barks and grunts of more
terrestrial animals, the insistent complaining calls of the peafowl, as well as
the grunting of brush turkeys and the honking of flamingoes, and ever so
many calls of cranes, geese and ducks to reminisce about, reminding one
of the far places of the world.
Delacour and I represented I.C.B.P. in a round-South America tour in
1955 with Mary, during which we visited national sections of the Inter-
national Council for Bird Preservation in Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina,
Chile, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia. In each country we made speeches
and had meetings to help to re-invigorate, post War, the National Sections
there. In a somewhat similar vein, we also visited South Africa for the
first International Pan African Congress held in Bulawayo, Rhodesia (as
it then was). It was a wonderful adventure for us, and in all of this, Dela-
cour was quite unflappable, eager to participate and share his merry jokes
and witticisms.
In 1960, Dr. Yoshimaro Yamashina, Chairman of the Japanese National
Section, issued an invitation to I.C.B.P. for a meeting in Japan, at which
we helped to inaugurate the Asian National Section, and spent an exciting
few weeks travelling north to Hokkaido and south through Kyushu in
search of rare birds.
Delacour never returned to Indochina after the war, nor indeed to
India, where so many of his pre-war friends had continued to live, but he
did give me letters to people such as the Maharajah of Bikaner, to whose
State I journeyed in 1947 with friends, and took part in one of the sensa-
tional sandgrouse shoots, now relegated to history. He was always fascina-
ted , and highly supportive of my research efforts with Dr. Salim Ali on

The Birds of India (1968*74), and equally so in connection with the mono-
graph that I managed to write on the family of the Rails (1977). A number
of his observations are incorporated in these volumes, but our best recol-
lections were the visits he made to Litchfield to see our waterfowl and to
take part in family events there. Jean became godfather of our youngest
daughter, Sylvia, and took enormous pleasure in family gatherings, of all
kinds and conditions, being devoted to both our mothers. He stayed for
long periods of time, either in Litchfield or New Haven,and later on in
Washington when he continued to come and occasionally talk, or visit
ornithological groups. All through the time of his appointment as Director
of the Los Angeles County Museum, we continued to visit and take part in
his ritual migrations, to France in the spring, returning to New York some-
times, to stay at the Knickerbocker Club in the autumn, and after his
retirement from the museum in Los Angeles, to spend part of the winter
in the California Club in that city itself. His stays in New York, at the
Knickerbocker Club, followed the demise of his two closest friends and
hostesses in that city. These were Mrs. Milton Erlanger, 'Kick' as she was
nicknamed, a vibrant, entertaining and highly dedicated conservationist,
and Mrs Carll Tucker, equally devoted to birds and bird conservation and
to the enterprise that we were carrying on in bird conservation through
I.C.B.P. The death of these two ladies was a crucial landmark in Jean's
life, as it was in so many of their friends and families, for indeed they
marked the passing of an age of important philanthropy and patronage
in the field of conservation.
One of the most entertaining episodes that I remember about Jean's
frequent stays in Litchfield came during the winter. In order to travel
around the duck ponds, I commandeered our farm jeep, and placing Jean
beside me in the front seat, proceeded to enter the gates and drive around
the edges of the ponds, looking for birds to identify. The ice seemed very
strong on one of the smaller ponds, and wanting to cross over to get on the
other side of a narrow canal, I suggested that we drive out onto the frozen
surface. We did so but alas, halfway along, the ice gave way and so the
jeep settled gradually on the bottom of the pond in the mud. Fortunately
the pond was fairly shallow, and so the water did not come into the body
of the jeep, but it left us in a pretty pickle. How could I persuade Jean to
wade ashore? Never doubting the possibility of a rescue, I shouted for
Allan Humphrey, then our faithful gamekeeper, who called up the Ameri-
can Automobile Association for a tow truck rescue. The tow truck finally
appeared and from the edge of a nearby road, sending out a long cable,
managed without any loss of dignity to pull us backwards out of the pond
and on to terra firma. Subsequently, the motor started up and we managed^

with appropriate chuckles and laughs and anecdotes, making the occasion
a festive one, as was his wont.
Similarly, not one of us who saw it will ever forget his 'mating 5 dance of
the Japanese crane, performed in a kimono in a small inn beside a lake in
northern Hokkaido one evening at a Japanese dinner. Jean looked the part
perfectly. Spreading out his long arms and waving the kimono sleeves, in
an effective manner, he circled around the room in a stately fashion, bow-
ing from time to time and imitating the gait of the formal male display. All
of this was accompanied with shrieks of laughter and delight from the
assembled group of bird lovers.
Towards the end Jean became crippled and found it difficult to walk
as his knees gradually gave way almost completely. He was gallant and
never referred to his physical difficulties, always joking, and always inspir-
ing others to joke with him. We were fortunate enough to have lunch with
him in Los Angeles a week before he died, and the occasion was memorable
for his jokes and anecdotes which continued as before. His like will not be
seen again, I feel sure, for he was in every way I can think of a unique
phenomenon.

WRITING "CURASSOWS" WITH JEAN DELACOUR

(Curator Emeritus, American Museum of Natural History, New York)
Curassows and Related Birds by Jean Delacour and the writer was pub-
lished by the American Museum in 1973; 3,400 copies were printed; it is
now out of print. The genesis of this book was peculiar. The late James
Oliver, then Director of the Museum, told me that 'Ben' (John H.) Phipps,
a patron of the New York Zoological Society, had offered to sponsor a
monograph on the pigeons and doves of the world to be written by his old
friend, Jean Delacour; would I help? Jean and 1 agreed that there are a
great many species of pigeons; further Mr. Derek Goodwin of the British
Museum (Natural History) had written an excellent, if sparingly illustrated,
treatise about them. Why not tackle a smaller family? I suggested the
curassows and guans (family Cracidae), a relatively little-known tropical
American group of only 40-odd species. This proved agreeable to all
parties.
Jean Delacour began to gather his notes on these birds, especially in
captivity (I remember seeing a fine pair of Bare-faced Curassows during a
visit to Cldres). He had seen the Yellow-knobbed Curassow in Venezuela
and heard its curious whistled 'song', so unlike the low-pitched rumblings
of other curassows. I had heard the deafening choruses of chachalacas in
Mexico, but now made trips to Venezuela to study curassows and guans.
Both ventures were led by the late Paul Schwartz, who knew the country
and birds well and to whom we eventually dedicated the book. On the first
of these ventures we were assisted by Mr. G. Stuart Keith of the American
Museum, who at that time had seen more species of birds in life, about
5,000 of the 9,000 that exist, than anyone else. On the second trip,
Mr. A1 Gilbert, who had been selected as the official artist for the volume,
came along; Gilbert also went to Central America and saw in life the
remarkable and rare Horned Guan. In Venezuela we were helped in many
ways by Mr. William H. Phelps, Jr., who, with his wife and father, has done
so much to advance ornithology in that country. I was able to study the
Black and Crestless Curassows, and the Marail, Spix's and Piping Guans,
as well as the local chachalacas. The Nocturnal Curassow we heard at
night but never saw. I have described these field experiences in Chapter XI
of the book.
Mr. Gilbert did most of the paintings for the book and also, with
Ms. Mondy Dana, designed it. We were fortunate to secure four fine water-
colour portraits of cracids from our friend the late George Miksch Sutton.

The supposedly extinct White-winged Guan posed a problem; there was
no specimen in any American museum; indeed there were only two in
existence. Mr. David Reid-Henry came to our rescue and painted the one
in the British Museum. In payment he received a pair of Red Jungle-fowl
from Delacour's flock at Clares. I hope they did not become victims of
the Crowned Eagle which, I was told, David had tethered to a chair in the
kitchen of his flat. A few years later the White-winged Guan was redis-
covered in the wild but it is rare and endangered.
At that time several individuals in Phoenix, Arizona, were interested in
curassows and breeding them in aviaries. There Gilbert and I, with letters
of introduction from Jean Delacour, went to see their birds and to learn
more of their experiences. Messrs. Mickey Ollson and Bernard Roer assis-
ted us in every way when we visited their private collections. We also
sought out Mr. Jack Throp, director of the Phoenix Zoo, who had recently
written an excellent paper on the world's curassows. Throp is now with
the famous collection of birds of paradise and other species at the Taronga
Park aviaries in Sydney, Australia.
Curassows and Related Birds , as I have said, appeared in 1973 and 1
believe that Jean Delacour and our sponsor Ben Phipps were pleased with
it. Neither of the authors accepted any royalties and this permitted a fine
production by modern standards.

Whilst admiring a sunset at the Archbold Biological Station in Florida
(Dick Archbold as a young man had accompanied the major expedition to
Madagascar led by Delacour) it occurred to me that a medal honouring
Jean Delacour might be appropriate. Upon returning to New York I pre-
sented this idea to Jean's good friend 'Kick' (Mrs. Milton) Erlanger and
suggested that such a medal be sponsored by the Avicultural Society. She
was enthusiastic but as she was at that time treasurer of the American
branch of the International Council for Bird Protection, which Delacour
had co-founded and guided as president; the decision was to give that or-
ganisation the honour of sponsoring the medal. After considering various
birds, including curassows, the decision was to use the figure of an Imperial
Pheasant, a species discovered by Jean Delacour, on one side of the medal

of presenting the medal for the first time to Jean's old friend, Nobelist
Konrad Lorenz.
I am but one of many individuals who cherish fond memories of that
gifted and unique individual, Jean Delacour.

July, 1940:
'During the last week in May, Cleres was heavily bombed by German
aircraft.Captain Jean Delacour wrote from Cleres on 2nd June that this
damage was annoying but not too serious and that it was his intention the
collection should be maintained if 'nothing worse happened&amp;apos;. Since that
date far worse events happened and the Editor last heard from Captain
Delacour on 10th June from farther south, where he had been retreated
with French troops, that Cleres had been entirely lost. In all his letters
Monsieur Delacour stressed the importance of continuing Avicultural
publications and his intention to do his utmost to achieve this end.'
October, 1940:
'The Bird Department of the New York Zoological Park added forty-
five new species to its collection during 1939, representing the greatest
annual total of new species in the history of the Park.'
November, 1940:
'News has been received that Captain Jean Delacour and his mother,
Madame T. Delacour, are alive and well; also there is some hope that
Cleres may not have been entirely destroyed.&amp;apos;
January-February, 1941:
'Friends of Captain Jean Delacour will be glad to know that he reached
Fisbon in December last en route for the United States of America.
Monsieur Delacour's address in America will be c/o Museum of Compara-
tive Zoology, Cambridge, Massachusetts.'

May--June, 1941:
'Geres, as a bird park, is no more . . When last I saw it, on 7th June,
some thirty bombs, dropped a fortnight before, already had marred its
appearance in many places and several hundred birds and mammals had
been killed. I was then ordered away with my army unit and I have not
seen Geres since . I was demobilised on 20th July. My small part in

the defence of France was finished . In August my friends, Dr. A. Urbain,
Director of the Paris Zoo, and M.F. Edmund-Blanc, visited Cleres on my
behalf They reported that possibly a thousand birds, or less than a third
of the original collection, remained . . I consented to have the rarest
removed to Paris . Soon it was made impossible to feed the remaining
birds and it became necessary for them to be disposed of to the firm of
Louis Ruhe, of Hanover....
'After spending four months following my demobilization in an idle-
ness which was painful . I was lucky enough to be allowed to go to
New York, where the hearty welcome of my American friends gave me a
new taste for life. 1 was soon offered the position of Consultant to the
New York Zoological Society. Needless to say I accepted and the great
interest I am taking in the work, as well as in some other of a scientific
nature at the American Museum, no doubt will gradually lessen my bitter-
ness over everything I have lost in Europe.
'The future is in the lap of the gods. It seems impossible to make any
plans at the moment but it would appear that conditions in France never
again will be such as to enable me to resume my usual occupations there or
to restore Cleres to its former state. '
In 1941 Captain Delacour arrived at the sudden end of a time of digni-
fied relative stasis at the Bronx Zoo. No major enclosures had been built
since 1912, when the Zebra House and Bird of Prey aviaries completed
the master plan of William T. Hornaday, the Zoo's first director (1896-
1926). Although the 1900 'Flying Cage' was entirely rebuilt on its origi-
nal frame in 1930, the single new exhibit built during the administration
of director W. Reid Blair (1926-1940) was 'Snake Island', outside the
Reptile House in 1932 (Bridges, 1974).
It was in 1941, after the brief, 'high-handed and arbitrary administra-
tion' (Bridges, 1974) of a former Superintendent of the New York Park
Department, that the office of Director was discontinued (not to be re-
instituted until 1952), replaced by a Planning Committee chaired by
Fairfield Osborn, President of the Zoological Society, with the Ichthy-
ologist John Tee-Van as Executive Secretary, and Lee S. Crandall, General
Curator.
Dr. Hornaday, violently opposed to moated enclosures, had died in
1937. Nineteen forty-one saw the opening of the revolutionary 'African
Plains', the barless panda exhibit (now for Pudu), the three-acre Moose
enclosure (currently housing Roosevelt Wapiti), the Children's Zoo, and
the removal of bars from the Elephant House yards (Anon. 1949). The
New York Aquarium, closed for subway construction, was relocated from

Battery Park to the Zoo's Lion House, where it was to remain until 1957.
It was under these circumstances that Jean Delacour was appointed
Technical Consultant to the New York Zoological Society. His employ-
ment* was no doubt at least partly in consideration of his major influ-
ence in the redesign of the Rome Zoo (1932-1934) and the construction
of the Parc Zoologique de Paris (Vincennes), 1931-34, not to mention his
election, in 1935, to the Council of the Zoological Society of London,
becoming its first foreign member.
July-August 1942
7 have spent an early June week-end in the country , with my friends
Mr, and Mrs. Milton Erlanger, and for the first time in many months I
have had the time and everlasting pleasure, to watch aviary birds. This may
sound strange , as my present position of technical adviser to the New York
Zoological Park gives me the control of the mammals , birds and reptiles,
and our collection of birds is now the best existing, numbering 1,800
specimens of 700 species, about half of which are perching birds. But my
duties are many and absorbing , with planning , committee meetings , and
office work, and I have little time to do more than quickly examine the
birds in our Zoo. Mr Lee Crandall, the Curator, and Head Keeper George
Scott, themselves overworked, are both excellent aviculturists, and I
rely upon them to take care of our birds . ?
March-April 1943
'For more than ten years it has always been a thrilling experience to see
Mr. C Cordier arrive with a collection of birds. It happens once or twice a
year. Until 1939 he used to bring his collections to Geres, and the surplus
material found its way mostly to the London Zoo , to Mr. A. Ezra and
Mr. Spedan Lewis in England " and to Dr. E. Beraint and M. Francois Ed-
mond-Blanc in France. These happy days are over , alas! But Mr. Cordier
still brings his collections , now to the United States. He brought to us, to
the New York Zoological Park, a marvellous Colombian collection in
December, 1941, and early in October 1942 , he was back again, this time
from Costa Rica , with perhaps the finest lot of birds he has ever secured. '
Captain Delacour had scarcely arrived at the Bronx Zoo when Charles
Cordier contacted him from Venezuela, having been stranded, since the
..the first time in my fifty years that I had been paid for my
work, except when I was on military service. It felt rather strange , but
it was satisfactory to realize that I could live on what I earned if the
necessity arose . &amp;apos;* (Delacour, 1966).

outbreak of war, in South America (Barclay-Smith, 1942).
With Cecil Webb, Wilfred Frost and Ferdinand Shaw-Mayer, Cordier
was one of a fabulous quartet of collectors, almost constantly in the field
throughout the 1930s, collecting largely for Delacour. Cordier's last ship-
ment, a magnificent collection of softbills, arrived at Cleres in May 1939,
from Tonkin, where he had gone almost directly after delivering to Cleres
Ocellated Turkeys and other Guatemalan birds (Delacour, 1939). He had
proceeded to South America in anticipation of further collecting when war
was declared, and contact with Europe was severed. Delacour had no idea
of his whereabouts.
Upon receipt of his letter from Venezuela in 1941, Cordier was at once
commissioned to make a collection of birds from the western side of the
Colombian Andes, where practically no collecting had been done previous-
ly. Establishing his base-camp at Ricaurte, Colombia, he assembled a
monumental collection, arriving in New York on 9th December, 1941
(two days after Pearl Harbour) with 81 birds of 24 species, at least eight
of them new to aviculture (Table 1).
The centre of attention was the group of Scarlet Cocks of the Rock
Rupicola peruviana sanguinolenta , the first specimens of R. peruviana
ever exported.
January-February 1948
'The scarlet subspecies . is the only one to have been imported alive
so far . .It is the finest of all and the only true scarlet one. It was first
brought alive to New York in December 1941 by C Cordier, who landed
twelve specimens in perfect condition, three of which remained at the
Bronx Zoo, the others going to other zoos, and a pair to Mrs. Milton
Erlanger (*) . They proved much more peaceful and sociable than
the Amazonian species . At the time of writing, two of the original males
are still living at the Bronx Zoo .. Since Mr. Cordier's visit in
1941 the inhabitants of South-Western Colombia, who had learnt from
him how to catch and to feed Scarlet Cocks-of-the-Rock, have regularly
sent a few every year to the Louis Ruhe firm, in New York. The same
thing happened with Quetzals in Costa Rica, so that these two mar-
vellous species are well represented in American collections. '
Early in March 1942, Cordier was on his way to Costa Rica, return-
*ln 1949 Captain Delacour, visiting Mrs. Erlanger's aviaries in Elberon,
New Jersey, found this pair 'finger-tamed and quarrelling to a minimum.....
They have already played at nesting, and hopes are high for a brood some
time!'(Delacour, 1950).

ing to New York on 9th October 1942 with 25 species, 17 never before
exhibited (Table 2).
March-April 1943
'There are ninety-six birds in the collection, including three Umbrella
Birds which have never before been exhibited alive. Fifty-four Humming
Birds of which the majority have never been imported anywhere, and
eighteen Quetzals, often called "the most beautiful birds in the New
World. '
'. The Umbrella Bird was probably the last great rarity among
tropical American birds, that have ever been exhibited. Until 1937 it
shared that distinction with the legendary Quetzal .......but in that year
the Bronx Zoo obtained nine of them. The eighteen Quetzals now brought
by Mr. Cordier are a Costa Rican form of the bird, and only one specimen
of this form has ever come to the United States.
\ . From the observations of Mr. Cordier, the Umbrella Bird spreads
its "umbrella" several times a day, when it is feeling particularly good. If
it actually sheds rain like an umbrella, the bird is more fortunate than
others in central Costa Rica, for it rains eleven months out of the year in
the Umbrella Bird country.
\ . ..The fifty-four Humming Birds in the collection comprise eleven
species, at least seven of which have never been exhibited in any bird
collection before.
'Athough larger shipments of Humming Birds, in point of numbers,
have been made by Mr. Cordier to Geres, in its variety and beauty the
present lot is the best that has ever been made from the highlands of the
American tropics.
\ . All the birds, a list of which follows (see Table II), arrived in
extraordinarily good condition, and more than a fortnight after their
arrival none had died.
'We had to dispose of some of the Quetzals, keeping ten for our collec-
tion. For the first time, I saw perfect specimens of these magnificent
birds, tame and feeding well. Six inhabit a large planted aviary, and al-
though there are several adult males, they never quarrel; neither do they
molest the small birds, mostly Sugarbirds and Tanagers, which share their

flight. The Umbrella Birds are also extremely tame and harmless. '
Charles Cordier was to make two further collections during Captain
Delacour's time at the Bronx Zoo. In 1944 he sent 33 hummingbirds
(Anna's, Black-chinned, Costa's, Calliope and Broad-tailed) from Calif-
ornia (Anon, 1944a and 1949), where he had been engaged in'war work'
since 1943. On 15th March, 1947, Cordier arrived from Guatemala with a

magnificent collection featuring three species of Trogons (Table III)
(Cordier, 1947a).
After Captain Delacour's return to Cleres, Cordier undertook many
subsequent collections for the New York Zoological Park: a second
Costa Rican collection in late August 1947 (Cordier, 1947b), the monu-
mental 1947-49 Congo Expedition (resulting in the first ever export of
Congo Peafowl) (Cordier, 1949), the incredible Ecuadorian collection of
1950, with its two species of Umbrella Birds, the first eleven Equatorial
Cocks-of-the-Rock exported and a Swordbill Hummingbird (Crandall,
1949), then from base camps established in the Congo and later Bolivia,
a number of shipments of birds and mammals through the 1950s, 60s
and 70s, sending a final shipment from Bolivia in 1983, just before his
retirement to Switzerland, which included Pale-legged Oven Birds Fur-
narius leucopus that hatched two chicks in September, 1985. Cordier
has also collected for many other zoos in Europe and the U.S.A. over
the last three decades.
Thus, while Wilfred Frost spent the Second World War in an intern-
ment camp in Singapore, and Cecil Webb lived off the land, dodging the
collaborationist government of Madagascar (and collecting intelligence),
Charles Cordier, through his connections with Jean Delacour, began an
association that resulted in some of the most magnificent animal collec-
tions ever assembled.
The arrival of Cordier's shipments coincided with a renovation,designed
by Captain Delacour, of the 1905 Bird House.
March-April 1943
'We are now completing the transformation of one of our halls, where
Pigeons and Parrots used to he kept in rather old-fashioned and ugly cages.
We are making five long planted flights of different styles, more or less
in the same way as the greenhouse aviaries at Cleres were planned. One
has a fast-running stream and is called the 'Tropical American mountain
stream'. It contains some Blue-headed and Ruddy Buntings, a small
South American Barbet, a dozen Manakins and Sugar Birds, a few small
Tanagers, and a pair of Fire-throated Humming Birds (Panterpe). The next
one is an Tndian-Malayan Jungle'; there live some small Fruit Pigeons,
Green wings, and Bleeding Heart Doves, a Pitta, a Rothschild's Starling,
a Shama, a small Javan Barbet, some Bulbuls and Babuls, a few Timor
Paddas and Crested Buntings.
'The other three, which will soon be completed, will be a 'desert', an
'American Garden ' and a 'Tropical American Rain forest'. It is great fun
designing and planting these aviaries. I find it the best substitute to the
pleasure I so long used to have at Cleres on a larger scale. '

May-June 1945
'When the astonishing circumstances under which we have all been
living during the past few years brought me to New York, I found a good
chance for experiment. I talked things over with my old bird friends
Fairfield Osborn, President of the Zoological Society, and Lee Crandall,
Curator of the Zoo, and in 1942 the old Parrot Hall of the Bird House
was converted into a planted aviary. The old cages were removed, and
in their place were built five flights, two on one side and three on the
other, each 18 to 20 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 8 feet high, and standing
two and a half feet above the floor. The hall is very high, and a giant
bamboo, two large Kentia palms, and a few other trees give it a tropical
garden atmosphere.
'Three of the flights are dedicated to tropical birds: Indo-Malaysian
and tropical American. Another one imitates an arid plain, while the
middle cage represents a little formal garden which we call the New
England Garden
'The "Arid Plain'', or desert cage is inhabited by birds adapted to
life in dry countries. It contains some Asiatic Pratincoles, African Sand-
grouse, Egyptian Plovers, Diamond and Plumed Ground Doves, many
species of Australian Grass Finches and African Wax bills, different Larks,
some Galapagos Finches, and two Costa's Humming Birds from the Cali-
fornian desert.
'Succulent plants such as aloes, cacti and yuccas have to be replaced
about three times a year, as the glass roof of the house is too high above
them and does not afford them sufficient light. But, at that price, the
show remains excellent. Needless to say, the birds do exceedingly well
and a number have nested successfully.
'The "New England Garden " is a little more difficult to keep in good
condition, as hardy plants do not last very long indoors. They have to be
replaced four times a year. We show in this cage a selection of our local
small birds: Ruby-throated Humming Birds, Bluebirds, Hermit, Russet-
backed, Veery and Wood Thrushes, Catbirds, Baltimore and Orchard
Orioles, Cedar Waxwings, Purple Finches, different "Warblers", Sparrows,
Nuthatches, small Rails, etc.
'To make and maintain such planted aviaries in suitable condition,
it is essential never to place in them birds which would destroy the plants,
and also to keep them perfectly tidy. An especially trained gardener
waters and tends them every morning with great care and a bird-keeper
cleans them thoroughly.
'This hall has been a great success with the public, and once again
the proof has been made that what is really attractive and well done is
appreciated by the ordinary visitors just as much as by specialized ama-
teurs. '

The Galapagos Finches consisted of one Geospiza magnirostris , one
G. scandens and six G. fuliginom , all wild-caught by David Lack. They
had been sent from the California Academy of Sciences in February
1942 to make room for experiments with captive-bred stock in San
Francisco. In June 1942, one G. fuliginosa hatched in the &amp;apos;Arid Plain'
(Kinsey, 1942).
In the spring of 1945, the first captive nesting of hummingbirds took
place in the &amp;apos;New England Garden'. A female Green Violetear Colibri
thalassinus cyanotus , from Cordier's 1942 Costa Rican collection, housed
there for want of space began stealing parts of a Zebra Finch nest from
the adjoining 'Desert'. After a nest was largely completed, the male was
introduced and began to sing regularly when the female died suddenly
of egg-binding (Anon, 1945a and b).
For the great majority of Cordier's series of hummingbirds, special
accommodations were designed by Jean Delacour.
March-April 1943:
'In the new home of the Humming Birds that is being rushed in the
Bronx Zoo&amp;apos;s Bird House , they will be exhibited behind glass in small
brightly lighted cages , while the public will view them from a black pas-
sageway. |
This exhibit, consisting of ten planted, glass-fronted displays housed in
a small building constructed within the 'Glass Court' of the 1905 Bird
House, was called the "Jewel Room". Opened to the public on 6th Nov-
ember 1942, after a preview for the consuls of nine Latin American
Countries, it was replaced in 1945 by a much larger "Jewel Room".
July-August 1946
'The problem of exhibiting cage birds in public zoos is a difficult
one. Until recently it has been tackled rather crudely. Too often just
rows of wire cages are lined up on shelves. In the better cases fixed com-
partments have been neatly built . But practically never before has it
been attempted to show the birds under the best possible conditions of
light, which enables one to detect all the usually elusive metallic colours
and delicate hues; nor, at the same time ; to set them in an artistic frame.
For many years I had planned to build a special hall " the walls of which
would have had glass openings , giving view to birds and fishes . Cages and
aquariums would have been decorated and planted. The effect would
have been that of so many animated , living pictures . They would be set
up in a wide corridor encircling the hall, where all facilities would be
provided for cleaning and for the care of the creatures.

'The centuries-old rooms of Cleres, with all their historic interest,
did not allow for such a scheme. But I had hoped to build a special house
some day in a secluded corner of the park. Fate has decided otherwise
...However, I had a chance to achieve at the New York Zoo for the public
what I once had dreamed to do at home for my own satisfaction. The
result has been what we call the "Jewel Room ".
'The Bird House in New York consists of three halls, the largest of
which has not been much altered these last years. We have only redecora-
ted the big central flight and some of the compartments. The second room
has been completely changed in 1942. The numerous cages and small
compartments for Parrots and Doves have been removed, and five roomy
flights have replaced them. They are decorated and planted so that they
now form the "New England Garden", for native species; "Arid Plain"
for desert birds; "Indo-Malayan Jungle", for Asiatic species; "Tropical
American Jungle Stream " and "Tropical American Rain Forest".
*The third hall was particularly unattractive in its former state: a
large room, 60 ft by 30 ft, with an ugly glass roof and plainly built com-
partments all around, each containing a number of small or medium-sized
birds. They were badly lit, and none of the beautiful colours or metallic
reflections of the inmates could be seen at real advantage. It was the more
unfortunate that it always housed a wonderful collection. This hall has
been entirely renovated during the winter of 1945, and it was reopened
as the "Jewel Room " a little more than a year ago.
'The transformation has been comparatively simple and easy - a smaller
room has been built inside the hall, entirely dark but for the light which
comes through the glass front of the cages that open in the walls; it all
looks like a gallery of live bird pictures, as in my original plan. Also it
reminds one of modern techniques used in aquarium and terrarium. The
hall has two large double doors, one at the end of the western wall, the
other one occupying most of the smaller southern panel As a result the
cages form two groups, one occupying the greatest part of the western
wall, the other L-shaped, all along the northern and eastern sides. Those of
the first group, ten in number and of three different sizes, are dedicated to
Humming Birds. The others consist of one large (10 ft by 11 ft) unplanted
but nicely decorated aviary mostly for hardbills, of two fair-sized planted
compartments (5 l A ft by 5 ft) and seven smaller ones (3% ft by 3 ft). They
are at present occupied by a Fairy Bluebird, a Rothschild&amp;apos;s Starling, a
Cock-of-the-Rock, and a number of Manakins, Sugar-birds, and small
Tanagers, which are doing exceptionally well in such quarters. They will be
ideal for Sunbirds, the smaller Birds of Paradise, such as Kings, Superbs,
and Wilson's, when they are again available. The large hardbills&amp;apos;aviary and
the two adjoining smaller cages are painted a gay light yellow inside. All

the others are pale greyish blue. I am against backgrounds with painted
landscapes or other scenes, as they are too difficult to keep clean. The
cages are strongly and appropriately lit by natural light from the glass roof,
and also from heatless electric tubes disposed at a favourable angle inside
the cages, at the top of the corner in front, quite invisible to the public.
The metallic reflections of the plumage are thus seen at their best. Troughs
are inserted through the bottom, along the back of the floor, and filled
with tropical plants and flowers. It looks like Gould&amp;apos;s plates, but it is alive.
'The public room, on the other hand, is absolutely plain, painted a dark
neutral grey, so that the visitor&amp;apos;s attention is not distracted from the ex-
hibits. We found that in order to give the proper illusion of adequate
space, cages must be very deep (deeper than wide) and that the back must
always be rounded, angles looking very ugly. Proper ventilation is essential;
and to ensure this holes have to be pierced at the lower part of the cage,
while the top if partly covered with small mesh wire netting, as used
against flies and mosquitoes.
'Rather complicated devices had to be conceived for the proper work-
ing of the cages. Mr. Lee Crandall, the General Curator and one of the
most experienced aviculturists I have known, has invented most of them,
with the help of the Head Keeper, G. Scott. For the cleaning of the
Humming Birds&amp;apos; compartments, we place on the top a bottomless movable
cage. A large trap in the top of the compartment slides outwards so that
the Hummer can easily fly up into the movable cage and be confined there
while the compartment is cleaned through the whole back side of the com-
partment, which can be opened. After cleaning the Hummer is easily
induced to fly down and re-enter its proper quarters. The larger cages are
cleaned through back doors, without shifting the birds, but the keeper
operates by placing himself inside movable panels, which constitute a
portable cage. If a bird escapes, it cannot go far, and it returns almost
immediately to its compartment.
'Birds behind glass cannot be heard, which is a pity, at the least for the
largest number of them. We have remedied that by conducting the sound
from the cages to the public hall by special devices. There is ample room
at the back for spare cages and all sorts of feeding and cleaning facilities.
*The "Jewel Room&quot; has proved a great success. It is, we think, an
excellent show, and the birds are doing exceedingly well in it. The good
effect obtained in the planted cages of the Jewel Room, as in other sorts
of aviaries, depends entirely on two essential conditions: keeping the
cages and the plants themselves meticulously clean, and also a wise choice
of the birds inhabiting them. Species harmless to the kind of vegetation
among which they are meant to live can only be placed there. Experience
helps considerably of course, but without it, the only thing to do is to try

to watch, and to remove, the offenders as soon as they are caught dama-
ging plants.
The plantings and rockwork of each cage were designed and selected
by Captain Delacour himself.
The 'Jewel Room' innovation of brightly lit exhibits in a darkened
hall was shortly adopted by many zoos. In 1948 Karl Plath redesigned
the east and west wings of the Brookfield Zoo's bird house, creating a
series of 'Picture Cages', some of them large enough for hornbills and
toucans (Plath, 1949). The 'Hall of Living Jewels' was opened by Gerald
lies, at the Belle Vue Zoo in Manchester, in 1949 (lies, 1950). This
concept was carried to extremes by Walter Van den bergh, at the Ant-
werp Zoo where in January 1946 there was 'legally notified and regis-
tered' the display of birds in compartments without any kind of barrier,
the only restraint being the bird's natural aversion to darkness (Barclay-
Smith, 1948). At the Bronx Zoo itself, the 'Jewel Room' technique was
extended to reptiles (Anon. 1944b), fishes (Atz, 1947) and small mammals
(Crandall, 1947).
Captain Delacour's renovations of the Bird House were largely main-
tained until 1972 when 'The World of Birds' was opened, coinciding
with the closing of the 1905 building. In 1960, three Tacazze Sunbirds
Nectarina tacazze were hatched in one of the 'Jewel Room' cages, two
surviving to independence (Conway, 1961). As far as I know, this remains
the only fully successful breeding of sunbirds in any American zoo.
Exhibits very similar to the 'Jewel Room' remain in existence in many
zoos, some of them quite recently constructed. One of the most successful
is the hall of 'Living Jewels of the Bird World' at Denver Zoo's 1975 Bird
House (Freiheit and Schmitt, 1977), where Green Wood Hoopoes, African
Pygmy Kingfishers, and Blue-crowned Chlorophonias have bred.
While there has been a recent disenchantment with small display cases
(Berry, 1983), Captain Delacour's Habitat Cages have become a standard
technique for the indoor exhibition of birds. In the U.S., some of the most
notable bird houses devoted entirely or primarily to mixed-species habitat
or regional displays are at San Antonio, Houston, Columbia (South Caro-
lina), Philadelphia, St.Louis and Denver. It is at the Bronx Zoo, however,
that the two most famous and, still, most magnificent bird houses based
on ecological or geographical assemblages are to be found, both conceived
by William G. Conway. Conway, whom Delacour had 'noticed and appre-
ciated long ago' (Delacour, 1966), General Director of the New York
Zoological Society since 1962, also, rather amazingly, Curator of Birds
from 1956 to 1973, personally designed the Aquatic Birds Building and
'The World of Birds'.

Opened in 1964 with the intention of showing 'the type of bird in the
kind of place it lives' (Conway, 1966), the Aquatic Birds Building has long
been recognised as a pivotal milestone in exhibit philosophy. Many of its
exhibits, particularly 'The Sea Cliffs' and 'The Shore', have been widely
copied. Among the many species bred there have been the first captive
hatchings of the Tufted Puffin and Puna Plover.
'The World of Birds', opened in 1972, remains the single most elaborate
installation expressly for birds in any zoo (Anon, 1972; George, 1975).
For the sentimental, it is pleasant to note that, among the many habitat
displays, there are, as in the 1940s, an Eastern North American forest, an
'arid scrubland' and a number of Asian and Tropical American exhibits,
including the enormous South American rainforest.
Captain Delacour did not by any means confine his renovations to the
Bird House. In the spring of 1941, Captain Delacour and Lee Crandall set
about redesigning the Great Flying Cage, erected in 1900, transforming a
rather barren summer display into a well-landscaped exhibit where a
number of species were displayed year-round (Crandall, 1943). To allow
for planting the aviary, the eight species and subspecies of pelicans, which
had been located there traditionally, were transferred, wing-clipped, to the
Zoo's Cope Lake, where pelicans continue to afford highly publicised
amusement when they are caught up each year in the autumn.
Lake Agassiz gave Captain Delacour an opportunity to exhibit gibbons
on an island, as he had at Cleres, for the first time in any American zoo.
March-April 1942
L ...Knowing how interesting their arboreal life could be, I kept an eye
open for a suitable exhibition place in the New York Zoological Park as
soon as I joined the staff of the Zoo. An island near the southern shore
of Lake Agassiz immediately recommended itself having a fair number of
good-sized trees and being not too far from the shore. .
'In the trees on "Monkey Island"as we somewhat inaccurately call the
gibbon and spider monkey exhibition island, the gibbons took instantly
and naturally to tree-dwelling life. At times when they were calling in
concert, I could stand on the shore and by shutting my eyes imagine that
I was back at some half-forgotten camp in Indo-China where their antics
and their ringing voices have charmed me innumerable times. '
"Gibbon Islands" are now almost a standard feature found, among
other places, at San Diego, Santa Barbara, Kansas City, Oklahoma City,
Denver, Brownsville and Minneapolis (indoors), as well as throughout the
world.
While engaged in his many zoo activities Captain Delacour managed to

this memorial issue but as a result of this programme Trumpeter Swans
became established at Jackson Hole (Wyoming), Lake Malheur and Ruby
Lake (Delacour, 1966). There are now more than 1,500 outside Alaska
(Todd, 1979).

7 used to go to the Bronx Zoo three or four days a week and spent the
balance of my time at the American Museum. I was given a comfortable
office and all the help I could possibly wish for by the curators of the
Department of Ornithology, Frank Chapman, Robert C Murphy, James
Chapin, John Zimmer and Ernst Mayr. I enjoyed the cordial and stimula-
ting company, and I used the excellent collections under their care to the
best of my ability.
'The American Museum of Natural History is one of the two or three
best in the world, and it owes its high quality, for the most part, to the
late Professor (Henry) Fairfield Osborn *, its President for many years. I
knew him well and I had the greatest respect for him. He was something
of a prophet: he told me as early as 1926, during my first visit, that one
day I would work at the American Museum. There seemed to be very
little likelihood of it in those days, since I was engaged in so many acti-
vities elsewhere. His prediction, however, was perfectly correct: I still
work at the Museum for several months each year and it has been my
headquarters for zoological studies since 1942. I have written my papers
and books there for over twenty years.. .'
In 1985, Dr. Delacour told me he had decided that year to close down
his office at the American Museum.
July-August 1945
7 have long been personally interested in waterfowl. For over twenty
years I kept at Cleres several hundreds of these fascinating birds, represent-
ingall the known wild species with the exception of twenty-six. They lived
there under almost natural conditions and many of them were breeding
regularly. This enabled me to make countless observations which were
*(1857-1935). A chief founder of the New York Zoological Park, and its
most influential board member, he was the father of Fairfield Osborn.
Dr. Delacour told me: 'Osborn was very high-handed. He thought he was
far superior to everyone! ...He was, in a way ...'

extremely valuable for the understanding of their relationship .
7 had already published several articles on the subject, notably in the
(i .Proceedings of the VUIth International Ornithological Congress , Oxford ,
1934" (1938). Since , however , more to ton learned, and at the sugges-
tion of several American ornithologists , Dr. Trwsf Afeyr /to / decided to
sum up our knowledge in a new , more important paper in English Our
study has been published in the Wilson Bulletin ", Vol 57, 1st March,
1945 (pp. 1*531 and I refer it to all persons interested. Our object has
been to effect a more natural grouping as species with a better under-
standing of their affinities expressed in a simpler taxonomy.
*The conventional classification of waterfowl usually so far adopted is
founded on a small selection of morphological characters, primarily
the shape of the bill and feet. Nothing could be more misleading ; as these
are entirely functional and undoubtedly often recently acquired represent-
ing merely a secondary adaption, that is repeated in widely separate groups.
We have used on the contrary a number of nonadaptive characters: pat-
tern of tarsus , plumage pattern in adults and chicks " posture, general body
proportions , length of neck and shape of head, internal anatomy and more
particularly biological peculiarities. Habits and behaviour are of paramount
importance , for they are deeply rooted and usually the product of very
ancient evolution. In the waterfowl family the main points are pair forma-
tion, displays , nesting, and feeding habits.
We believe in large genera , since it is the function of generic names to
express relationship not distinctness, which is expressed by the species
name. &amp;apos;
Dr, Delacour was a pioneer, with Ernst Mayr, of 'the new systematics'
(Mayr, 1986) based on supposed evolutionary relationships and inferred
common descent rather than entirely on structure (Mayr, 1969), thus his
emphasis upon morphological and behavioural features upon which
natural selection has not had a strong influence, in other words, &amp;apos;non-
adaptive characters'.
From this perspective, Dr. Delacour examined the relationships of the
members of the Anatidae (Waterfowl), Pycnonotidae (Bulbuls), Nectar*
inidae (Sunbirds), Estrildids (Waxbills, Mannikins, etc.) and Phasianines
(Pheasants) and many genera, such as Scops Owls Otus and Crow-tits
or Parrotbills Paradoxomis , resulting in a great assemblage of papers, as
well as his magnificent monographs of Pheasants (1951) and Waterfowl
(1954-64).
A major taxonomic legacy of Dr. Delacour are the large genera he
created from plethoras of small, often monotypic ones. The hodge-podge
of 'Gallo-Pheasants 5 - Genmeus , Hierophosius , Houppifer, Lophura,

Diardigallus and Lobiophasius - he united under Lophura (Delacour,
1949), while the Goose genus Anser was made to absorb Chen, Philacte,
Cygnopsis and Eulabia (Delacour &amp; Mayr, 1945).
Throughout the war Captain Delacour was not only publishing sci-
entific papers, but wrote almost continuously for avicultural publica-
tions, especially the Avicultural Magazine and Aviculture , the journal of
the Avicultural Society of America. He became President of the Avicul-
tural Society of America in 1950, and in 1951 arranged for the publica-
tion of its members' articles in the Avicultural Magazine (Delacour, 1951),
a policy that was to continue happily for a number of years.
November 1944
'Today I have come back to where I stood when I was five years old
I personally own two birds: a Roller Canary in my bedroom, and a very
good Shama, a present of a kind friend, Mrs. E. Erlanger, which enlivens
my charming office at the Bronx Park . As I write, he sings delightfully.
&amp;apos;The New York Zoo collection, it is true, is excellent; I have rearranged
the cages to suit my taste, and I admit that it is the best possible compen-
sation for the loss of my own birds, now all killed or dispersed. Still noth-
ing can ever replace them .'
September 1945
&amp;apos;....Nowhere - and I have seen most of the public zoological gardens on
every continent - have I found another institution with the burning faith
in the educational possibilities and scientific study of animal life, and the
determination to bring its dreams to fruition, that the New York Zoolo-
gical Society displays . I say it again: the New York Zoological Society
is unique in its purposes, ideals and accomplishments. '
March-April, 1946
(In an article about birds at semi-liberty at Villers-Bretonneux and at
Geres, 1905-1940).
&amp;apos;All this is a thing of the past at Geres. But Mr. F.E. Fooks is back
there, and this past has a fair chance to be partly revived in the near future.
As a link, I hear that a Festive Amazon, which we brought over from
South America and liberated in 1921, is still to-day flying around the
Manor House and the terrace. If he could talk better than he does, he
would no doubt tell much, and some of his stories would probably bring
tears to all my friends who knew Geres in its former splendour. *

France. '
Thus arrived in 1946 the first Pere David's Deer in the Western Hemi-
sphere.
Frank Fooks departed New York on 16th January 1947 (Anon, 1947),
with a shipment of birds from the Bronx Zoo which formed part of the
nucleus of the new collection at Cleres, which was officially reopened in
May 1947 as a public zoological park.
Captain Delacour left his position as Technical Adviser to the New
York Zoological Society in 1947, in order to supervise the rebuilding of
Cleres. His cordial association with the Zoological Society continued,
however, especially as he spent every autumn in New York until 1984,
spending three or four months each year at the American Museum of
Natural History. When the position of Field Associate in Ornithology of
the New Yok Zoological Society was created during the Conway admini-
stration, he was at once thus appointed and remained so for the rest of
his life.

JEAN DELACOUR'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE

At the end of the Great War, the lands that formed the region then
known as French Indo-China were still largely unexplored by naturalists.
The world's natural history museums contained a small number of speci-
mens from this remote region, largely obtained by French missionaries
with an interest in zoology.
The Paris Museum contained specimens of such wonderful birds as the
Giant Ibis Pseudibis gigantea , Edward's Pheasant Lophura edwardsi,
Crested Argus Pheasant Rheinardia ocellata , Renauld's Ground Cuckoo
Carpococcyx renauldi , and Elliot's Pitta Pitta ellioti , and these inspired
Jean Delacour to commence a series of expeditions to Indo-China, and to
undertake a thorough zoological survey of the country.
Between 1923 and 1938 Jean Delacour led seven expeditions to Indo-
China, and was able to explore every part of the region. The areas covered
by these expeditions were as follows:

From the first expedition Jean Delacour was assisted by Pierre Jabouille,
then Governor of French Indo-China, and he had already made collections
of birds and other animals and sent them to the Paris Museum. Jabouille
was to remain Delacour's co-worker throughout the seven expeditions,
and their collaboration resulted in the joint authorship of Les Oiseaux de
L'Indochine Francais (four volumes, 1931) which is still the standard
work on the avifauna of the region.
As well as Pierre Jabouille, Jean Delacour was accompanied at various
times by other notable naturalists including J.C. Greenway, A. David-
Beaulieu, P. Engelbach and Willoughby Lowe. Over the period of the

expeditions some 30,000 birds and 8,000 mammals were collected, to-
gether with a vast quantity of insects and other forms of animal life. The
majority of the collections were presented to the Paris Museum, although
a number also went to the British Museum and to Lord Rothschild's
collection at Tring.
A large number of living creatures were also brought home by the
expeditions, and most of these went to Jean Delacour's estate at Cleres
although a number went to the private collections of Alfred Ezra, J. Spe-
dan Lewis and Madame Lecallier, as well as to various zoos. The collec-
tions contained a huge number of species new to aviculture, and some of
the more spectacular species included the Imperial Pheasant Lophura
imperialis, discovered on Delacour's first expedition,Edward's Pheasant
L. edwardsi, Crested Argus Pheasant Rheinardia ocellata, Renauld's
Ground Cuckoo Carpococcyx renauldi, Blue-throated Bee-eater Merops
viridis and Elliot's Pitta Pitta ellioti. Many reared young, and it is doubt-
ful if aviculturists in the West will ever again have the opportunity to see
some of these wonderful species in captivity.
Jean Delacour's work in Indo-China filled huge gaps in the scientific
knowledge of the area, and his collections have provided a foundation for
zoological research that, due to the current political situation in the
region, may be impossible to supplement. The vast amount of energy that
Dr. Delacour devoted to his research in Indo-China is all the more remark-
able when one considers that at the time he was also building up his great
private collection at Cleres, writing many important papers, and serving
on the councils of several international societies.

DR DELACOUR AND THE TRUMPETER SWAN
RESCUE PROGRAMME

Whilst Dr. Delacour wrote many articles on all aspects of aviculture, 1
have always associated him with waterfowl and as swans are the most
majestic of all water birds, I would like to reprint his article, The Fate of
the Trumpeter Swan', from the November-December 1944 issue of the
Avicultural Magazine. I am sure that many readers who do not possess
this old issue will be very interested to read of this project.
May I say that the status of the Trumpeter Swan has improved since
the article was written and, according to information given to me by
Mr. J.B. Blossom, Assistant Director of the Wildfowl Trust, there are
now 325-350 swans on Red Rock Lakes, Montana, and 150 birds in the
Yellowstone Park, Wyoming (figures given by the Trumpeter Swan Society,
1984). There was also a population of 5,000 birds in Alaska according to

THE FATE OF THE TRUMPETER SWAN

Of the seven existing species of Swans, the Trumpeter is the largest.
Leaving aside the two smaller southern species, the Black from
Australia and the Black-necked from South America, it surpasses
in size and strength the other five northern species. To give a rough
idea of it the average wing length of the Trumpeter is 665 mm.,
while that of the popular, semi-domestic Mute Swan is 590 mm.
In shape and behaviour the latter bird is, of course, quite distinct.
The two other White Swans of Europe and Asia, the Whooper and
Bewick's, and the two American species, the Trumpeter and the
Whistler, are closely allied and have the same general appearance.
They cannot raise their wings in anger as the Mute and Black do ;
they hold their neck straight most of the time, and they have a
resounding, bugle-like voice, varying in intensity, but, generally
speaking, of a similar quality.

It is a curious, but by no means a unique fact, that each continent
should possess two such closely related species. At first sight one would
be inclined to consider them all as subspecies of the same species.
But the breeding ranges of the Whooping (Cygnus cygnus ) and Bewick's
{Cygnus c. bewicki and C. c. jankowskyi) overlap. Those of the two
American forms, however, do not, the Whistling Swan (C. Colum-
bians) nesting in the north of Alaska and Canada, while the Trumpeter
(C. buccinator ) lives and breeds in the interior of the western United
States and British Columbia.
From a strictly systematic point of view the Trumpeter, the Whistler,
and the Whooper could possibly be considered as three subspecies
of the same species or, at any rate, as forming a superspecies. Or the
Trumpeter and the Whooper may be two subspecies of the same
species, as also the Whistler and the Bewick's. As it is impossible
to decide, the safest course is to call these Swans four species, very
closely related.
To give an idea of the relative size of all these birds it can be pointed
out that their average wing measurements are as follows :--
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.735556" page_id="56240796"  page_num="60" year="" vol="">
Trumpeter . 665 min.
Whooper . 604 mm.
Whistler . 550 mm.
Bewick's . 526 mm.
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.981572478260869" page_id="56240796"  page_num="60" year="" vol="">
The other principal differences in these Swans is the presence,
extent, or absence of a yellow patch on their bill. Generally speaking
the Whooper has the basal two-thirds yellow ; the Bewick's only
one-third ; the Whistler has a small yellow mark on the sides, near
the forehead ; and the Trumpeter has a wholly black bill.
Unfortunately many Whistlers lack the yellow spot and it is often
very difficult to distinguish them from Trumpeters. On the whole
Trumpeters are a good deal larger and have a heavier bill and a
longer neck, but between a small Trumpeter and a large Whistler
there are few obvious differences. Some of the latter have a wing of
580 mm., while some specimens of Trumpeters have it as short as
530 mm. In such cases the only sure character is the voice--much
deeper in the Trumpeter, and if the bird is dead and can be dissected
the shape of its treachea, or windpipe, is a certain proof of its identity.
In the Trumpeter it makes a vertical loop over a lump on the breast-
bone (sternum), and emerges through a separate opening. In the
Whistler this loop does not exist, and there is only one hole for the
entrance and exit of the windpipe.
The Trumpeter is a rather sedentary bird compared to the other
three which nest in the far north and winter comparatively far south,
being truly migratory. The Trumpeter travels only in search of open
water and food. In other words it breeds as far south as it can and
winters as far north as possible, while the other three species do exactly

the reverse.
These life habits have been almost fatal to Trumpeters. In former
days they ranged all over the centre of western North America, from
British Columbia to California, east to Manitoba, Minnesota, Iowa,
Missouri, Arkansas, and Colorado. It was supposed even to reach
the coast of California and the Gulf of Mexico. But it seems unlikely
that the species ever went so far, and more probably black-billed
Whistlers have been erroneously recorded as Trumpeters.
Because of these more or less sedentary habits which resulted in
their nesting and wintering in areas which became settled by man
when the country was opened up Trumpeter Swans were sooner
slaughtered than the other species, which up to these days, have
enjoyed relative security at least in their breeding grounds in the
North. The Whistling Swan, now adequately protected, is still
extremely abundant, but the Trumpeter is making its last stand in
the wilds of British Columbia and in a few protected spots in Montana
(Red Rock Lakes) and Wyoming (Yellowstone National Park). It
has disappeared from all other parts of its former range.
Some years ago there were supposed to be a few hundred birds in
British Columbia and under sixty in the United States. To-day
the position is a little more hopeful. Thanks to the establishment
of the Red Rock Lakes Refuge, their last stronghold, there are some
180 birds in it to-day as well as about fifty in the Yellowstone. No
really accurate census of the Canadian birds has yet been taken, but
500 is their estimated number. In Montana, however, their increase
has been slowed up during the last few years, and the Fish and Wildlife
Service (Department of the Interior) of the United States Government
is trying to remedy this regretable state of things. Having recently
been appointed a collaborator of the Service, and acting as an adviser,
I have inspected in May, 1944, the present haunts of the Trumpeter
Swans, and possible locations where the birds could be established.
The following extracts of my report will give an idea of our present
project to propagate and save the species :--
" According to instructions from the Director of the Fish and
Wildlife Service, dated 2nd May, 1944, I arrived at Portland, Oregon,
on 16th May and left the next day in the company of Mr. Leo L.
Laythe, Regional Director, for the Malheur Lake Refuge, where we
arrived on the same day and stayed until 19th May.
" We inspected different spots in the Refuge which could be
favourably used for the establishment under control of young birds
and of breeding pairs of Swans.
" On the 20th we visited the Elk Refuge, Jackson, Wyoming, where
three Trumpeter Swans have been introduced, but so far have not
attempted to breed, the odd bird probably interfering with the other
two. Furthermore, their sex remains unknown. We also inspected
spots where breeding pens could be established later on.

" From 2 ist May to the 23rd we were at Red Rock Lakes Refuge,
where we observed a number of Swans and gathered much valuable
information from the Manager, Dr. Ward M. Sharp, and his fellow
workers. It appears that the breeding Swans have no difficulties in
rearing their broods, that they are not appreciably disturbed by
predators, and that it is easy, as it has been proved in the past, to
capture young Swans before they can fly, during the late summer.
" It is proposed that all cygnets captured (half of the 1944 crop)
will be deposited at Malheur Lake, in a large pen encircling several
acres of open water, eminently suitable for the purpose. Mr. Laythe
and I have given to Mr. J. Scharff, Manager of the Refuge, all the
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.945038869565217" page_id="56240798"  page_num="62" year="" vol="">
necessary instructions for their installation.
" A large number of young Swans, under three years of age, can be
kept together there. In two years' time suitable pens for breeding
pairs will be built and the birds separated. I advise that not more
than six pairs should be kept at any one Refuge, in the beginning,
in order to divide the risks. Such pairs could possibly be established
at Malheur Lake, Elk Refuge, Ruby Lake, Camas, etc. . . .
" Conditions necessary to ensure the success of the project are
as follows :--
" 1. Captive birds must be housed far enough away from localities
where wild Trumpeter Swans live as the latter would fly in and attack
the captive birds.
" 2. There must be some open water during the coldest weather.
" 3. Each pen should be set in a 4 natural ' and sheltered spot so
that each pair of birds feels at home. It should include one acre of
water and one of land as a minimum.
" 4. Trumpeter Swans, particularly the chicks, suffer from the
summer heat. They must be housed in places where the summer is
cool. Winter temperature is unimportant.
44 5. Pens must be free of the danger of botulism.
" 6. Waters where snapping turtles occur are unsuitable for the
purpose of breeding all wildfowl.
" 7. Pens must be vermin-proof, and predators, both mammals

and birds, must be controlled in the neighbourhood.
44 Under such conditions breeding successes are certain as it has
been proved in Holland, France, and England during fifty years.
Trumpeter Swans become adult at the age of three years, and they
will usually breed when four or five years old if they are submitted
to favourable conditions and treatment. Once started they become
regular breeders.
" In the United States the Trumpeter Swan population at present
is just over 200, roughly speaking, and that is a dangerously low level.
Like all large birds breeding in an inhabited country they would
soon disappear in a purely free and unprotected state and, in fact,
they have only survived through artificial help. There is no prospect
that sufficiently extensive suitable wild conditions can ever be restored.

Thus it is imperative to compensate man's encroachments by appro-
priate measures such as winter feeding and controlled breeding.
" A comparatively small proportion of the present population is
now breeding, about 20 per cent, and many birds remain long unmated.
This is probably caused by the scarcity of available nesting sites.
Old mated pairs are extremely jealous and savage during the breeding
season, they keep to themselves a large territory and younger birds
are unable to appropriate any. The only remedy is to remove some
of the young birds and give them a chance to breed elsewhere.
" Their introduction in a free state into another refuge has proved
a failure so far and should be discontinued in its present form. A better
method is to breed them in captivity and, later on, to stock suitable
areas with the young produced, under special management. Also,
the fact that a number of breeding birds exist under control in different
refuges will avert forever the threat of the extinction of the species.
That Trumpeter Swans respond readily to reasonable captive con-
ditions has been proved in Europe."
As many of our readers will remember Trumpeter Swans have been
very successfully kept and reared in Europe in the past. The late
F. E. Blaauw bred some regularly since 1902 , and long before they
nested successfully in France and in England. There is a record as
early as 1873 . At the time of the dispersion of the Blaauw collection
in 1937 there were still sixteen Trumpeters at Gooilust, four being
hatched the same year. They all went to Woburn Abbey, where the
late Duke of Bedford already had, if I remember correctly, four
specimens. I hope that these rare birds still live and that they have
since increased in number. They are the only ones in Europe.
In the course of years many young birds reared at Gooilust were
disposed of. I acquired several as early as 1919 , and others were
sold later on to different zoos and parks, even to America, where four
were purchased by the New York Zoo, while others went to the
Kellog Sanctuary in Michigan.
It is therefore very probable that a good number of breeding pairs
will have been established within a few years in America. I intend
to do all I can towards this end, the only safe method to save from
extinction this most remarkable species, the largest of all Anatine
Waterfowl.
Appendix
At the end of August and early in September I was again at the
Red Rock Lakes Refuge, in Montana.
The last census made showed the existence of 169 adult and 62
young Swans, a satisfactory increase certainly due to better manage-
ment and heavier winter feeding.
Two cygnets have been hatched and reared without difficulty by
broody hens, from wild collected eggs, according to my instructions.
The robbed pair, however, did not nest again as hoped.

We quickly captured twenty cygnets on the shallow, weed-filled
lakes. They are easily run down in a boat. The sight of the flying
adult birds was magnificent, and they were not unduly disturbed,
remaining in the vicinity during the operation.
The cygnets, six to ten weeks' old, proved fearless and tame from
the beginning. They started feeding on green food, bread, and wheat
as soon as they were released in a small pen with a pool.
The 700 miles' journey to the Malheur Lake Refuge, in Oregon,,
took three days, and was successfully effected in a lorry fitted with
especially built crates, each containing two birds.
On arrival the cygnets were rested in a pen for twenty-four hours,
then pinioned and placed in a large enclosure including a 3 -acre
pond fed by strong springs, where they will remain until they reach
their third year.
A visit to the Yellowstone National Park showed that the Trumpeter
Swans just hold their own there. They number now forty-four
adult and eleven young birds. Too many nests are destroyed and too
many cygnets are killed by predators. Steps will be taken to obviate
these dangers in the future.

A. MEMORY OF JEAN DELACOUR

I cannot claim to have been in any sense a friend or close associate of
Jean Delacour. I did, however, meet and talk with him on many occasions
when he visited the old Bird Room of the British Museum (Natural History)
in South Kensington, where I worked for many years. He certainly made a
great impression on me as, I imagine, he must have done on all who met
and spoke with him, however briefly.
Jean Delacour's many and wide-ranging contributions to aviculture and
ornithology will, I am sure, be dealt with elsewhere in this memorial issue,
by others better qualified than I to do so. He was, or so I have always
assumed, a very rich man. Many rich people appear to get little enjoyment
out of their wealth and give little benefit from it. He used his to further his
own undoubted talents and to bring a great deal of knowledge and plea-
sure to others.
Friendliness and forthrightness appeared to me to be keynotes of his
character. I always recall with gratitude his enthusiasm and encouragement
(which meant a lot to me then) when, in the late 1940s, I told him of
some observations I had made on my Golden Pheasants.
It is, perhaps, easier and less hazardous for the rich to be frank. Even
so, many rich people (like the rest of us) trim their verbal sails to current
political and social winds lest men and the media speak ill of them. Not
Jean Delacour! If the conversation turned to politics, race or other 'sensi-
tive' subjects he said what he thought, not what he thought others thought
he ought to think.
At least one or two of his prophecies in this line, uttered around 30
years ago and then, indeed still, very much 'against the official line' have
proved only too lamentably true. But, being a less courageous person
myself, I shall not 'stick my neck out' by citing them here or elsewhere.
It is obvious that Jean Delacour will be missed as an outstanding and
gifted aviculturist and ornithologist. I think he will also be missed as an
honest, kindly, helpful and very intelligent individual whose death is a loss
for all who knew him, even if, like myself, only a little.

JEAN DELACOUR: FAMOUS AVICULTURIST AND AUTHOR
A PERSONAL TRIBUTE
By Professor CARL NAETHER
(Encino, California, USA)

<bodyText confidence="0.998757171428571" page_id="56240802"  page_num="66" year="" vol="">
As one of a great many of Jean Delacour's American friends and
admirers, I welcome this opportunity of paying a well-deserved tribute to
this great birdman's character and accomplishments.
Well over 50 years ago, I had the privilege of meeting this charming
Frenchman (long since become an American citizen) for the first time.
Since then, personal visits to his beautiful 'retreat, in Cleres, France, to
his administrative office at the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History
which he headed, and in Los Angeles City proper, where he and his
mother occupied a spacious mansion with an adjoining, beautifully land-
scaped garden and aviary housing rare flamingos, hummingbirds, fruit
pigeons among numerous other attractive species. These friendly meetings
gave me a good opportunity to learn to know, and very soon to appreciate,
this gentle man's character and personality.
What impressed me most favourably were Jean Delacour's friendliness,
modesty and, of course, the wide scope of his ornithological knowledge,
greatly enriched as it was by his expeditions into foreign lands in search
of rare pheasants and other birds, the very distinctive collections of many
different species of small and large birds which he maintained at Cleres
and in Los Angeles, and finally and very importantly, by his extensive
publications of magazine articles and books.
Jean's friendliness manifested itself in the disarming ease with which he
welcomed strangers and visitors to his offices as well as his aviaries by
engaging them quickly in informal conversation on their favourite subjects,
and branches of aviculture. Strangers meeting him for the first time were
immediately and favourably impressed by this man's outright sincerity.
Jean was no poseur. His open, appealing personality 'came clear and
through' at a first meeting, thus readily paving the way for a continuing
and usually long-lasting friendship.
A most pleasing and appealing quality of this friendship was this man's
charming modesty. In my many years of engaging him in, and listening to,
his conversations there was never the slightest boast of personal accom-
plishments, yet every opportunity to commend his listener to what he had
done well was eagerly seized by Jean.
He was the 'soul of discretion', and as far as I know never spoke ill of
any person, not even in cases where certain censure of avicultural practices,

<bodyText confidence="0.995763" page_id="56240803"  page_num="67" year="" vol="">
as in selling and advertising birds, might have been justified.
Perhaps Jean Delacour's most helpful and finest personal trait was his
eager willingness to help aspiring aviculturists by answering the multitude
of questions arising from keeping and breeding foreign birds in captivity.
He went to great lengths to reproduce birds' natural habitats in captivity
and was eager to write about his methods of maintaining and breeding
them. He did not believe in keeping information secret.
In conclusion, this writer regards Jean Delacour as one of our most
important and successful aviculturists, whose authoritative writings will
serve as an enduring and noble testimony of useful, efficient and thoroughly
worthwhile human effort.

JEAN DELACOUR AND THE AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE

From 1916 to 1977 there was no volume of the Avicultural Magazine
which did not contain at least one contribution by Dr. Delacour. With the
articles and memorials written in 1979, 1980 and 1982, there is a grand
total of 279, covering 66 years, from the age of 25 to 91.
Over this span, six periods may be designated:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9919822" page_id="56240804"  page_num="68" year="" vol="">
1. 1916-1918: Delacour's last years at Villers-Bretonneux, his family
estate in Picardy, destroyed near the end of the war, where he had estab-
lished his First, monumental collection. Delacour was in active military
service throughout this time.
2. 1919-1940: The 'Golden Age' of Cleres. It was during this time that

Delacour led the great expeditions to Indo-China and Madagascar, and
travelled and collected around the world. From 1923 to 1931 Delacour
wrote the major portion of Aviculture , a compendium of avicultural
knowledge to that time, initially serialised in the Avicultural Magazine and
L'Oiseau.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.838539352941177" page_id="56240804"  page_num="68" year="" vol="">
3. 1941-1947: The New York years, when Captain Delacour was Tech-
nical Advisor to the New York Zoological Society and conducted exten-
sive taxonomic research at the American Museum of Natural History, a
partial result being his monographs of the Pheasants and the Waterfowl.
He was also employed by the U.S. Department of the Interior in the
effort to restore the Trumpeter Swan.
4. 1947-1951: The restoration of Cleres as a public exhibit, bequeathed
to the French Government, was supervised by Delacour. In 1951, as Presi-
dent of the Avicultural Society of America, he arranged for the publica-
tion of its members' articles in the Avicultural Magazine , a situation that
prevailed until 1960.
5. 1952-1960: The Los Angeles years, when Captain Delacour was
Director of the Department of History, Sciences and Art for the County
of Los Angeles. He established a small but important collection of birds at
Los Angeles, while continuing to direct the restoration and improvement
of Cleres.
6. 1960-1982. 'Retirement'. Captain Delacour was mandatorily retired

and part of the winter in Los Angeles, with a great deal of travelling as
well. He maintained an office at the Department of Ornithology at the
American Museum of Natural History until 1985. Only an increasing
arthritis of the hands ended his writing, to his very great annoyance.
Throughout these contributions runs an endless enthusiasm and curio-
sity, at once avicultural and ornithological, resulting in such achievements
as the discovery of the Imperial Pheasant in Viet Nam (1923) or the Luzon
Parrot Finch in a pet store in Los Angeles (1937). There is also a continu-
ous delighted amazement - at Papuans growing Zinnias and Marigolds
(1963), or the arboreal Giant Anteater at Ravenna (1965). At the same
time, there sometimes pervades a dismay at a world so often uglier and
less reasonable than needs be, of which Dr. Delacour grew increasingly
fond of saying that he had seen enough by the age of 95.
Although Dr. Delacour published his work in systematic ornithology
in The Ibis , The Auk , publications of the New York Zoological Society,
or the American Museum of Natural History, and other scientific journals,
his Avicultural Magazine articles are replete with novel ornithological
observations, and a number deal specifically with systematics, for example,
the relationship between most honey-creepers and the tanagers (1972).
Overall, Jean Delacour's 66 years of contributions to the Avicultural
Magazine are an amazingly thorough record of his own avicultural achieve-
ments, and those of many friends and institutions, work that has estab-
lished so much of what we have today.

JEAN DELACOUR'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE
AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE, 1916-1982

(Reigate, Surrey)
Jean Delacour submitted his first article to the Avicultural Magazine
shortly before enlisting as a liason officer in the French Army in 1916.
Over the next 60 years, Jean Delacour contributed over 250 articles
to this magazine, detailing his remarkable private collection at Cleres,
giving news of friends' aviaries, reporting on his numerous expeditions
and a large variety of other avicultural and ornithological matters.
My original intention was to attempt a complete bibliography of
Jean Delacour's published writings in all journals. However, I soon realised
that it would almost require a separate publication in itself to list many
hundreds of papers published in The Ibis, The Auk, VOiseau, Animal
Kingdom, Wilson Bulletin amongst other international journals. There-
fore I decided to list all articles by Dr. Delacour that have appeared in
the Avicultural Magazine and 1 hope this reflects the industry and devotion
to the Society possessed by our former President.
As a supplement, I have also decided to list his writings that have
appeared in book form, several of which remain standard works on their
subjects.

We are most grateful to the many members who have helped to produce
this memorial issue and we would like to thank all the contributors for
taking the time and trouble to write such interesting articles. This response
is indeed a token of the esteem in which Jean Delacour is held by so many.
Our thanks are also due to Miss Ruth Ezra, President, and Mr. Raymond
Sawyer, Vice-President, lifelong friends of Jean Delacour, whose idea it
was to publish this issue.
We have tried to cover the various aspects of this great man&amp;apos;s life but
are aware of many omissions. On the other hand, with a compilation such
as this, there is inevitable repetition which would have been very difficult
to edit out without losing the essence of each article. However, we hope
that we have given some idea of his achievements and that younger mem-
bers in particular, who may not have had the pleasure of meeting Jean
Delacour, may be stimulated by this issue to read more of his writings.
Many of the issues of the Avicultural Magazine containing his articles
(listed by Alan Gibbard on page 70) are still available from our extensive
stock of back numbers - please send enquiries to the Hon. Secretary. In
future issues we hope to publish lists of references to other journals to
which Jean Delacour contributed regularly.
We hope that you will enjoy reading this special double issue.

* BREEDING THE DESMAREST'S FIG PARROT
By ROSEMARY WISEMAN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.973455567567567" page_id="56240819"  page_num="83" year="" vol="">
(London)
Fig parrots have never been freely available to the aviculturist, and have
always been highly sought after. This is undoubtedly because their rarity
is coupled with great beauty, but they are also attractive because they pose
something of a challenge when kept in captivity.
The problems associated with them seem to take two forms. Firstly, fig
parrots do have a habit of dying apparently unaccountably, often revealing
some sort of haemorrhage on post mortem. This kind of death in a pair of
Salvadori Fig Parrots is reported by Billet (1979). Secondly, fig parrots,
although ready to breed seem to be incapable of rearing chicks on what we
are able to provide for them. All the accounts of breeding I have read seem
to follow a similar pattern of successful hatching, followed by the chicks
dying at anything from two days to six weeks later (Anon, 1983). Never-
theless, even taking these drawbacks into account, fig parrots as a group
are most charming in appearance and behaviour. They belong to two
genera which are anatomically distinct from other parrots according to
Holy oak, the source quoted by Foreshaw.
The two genera are Opopsitta and Psittaculiwstris. The Double-eyed
Fig Parrot is the representative of the Opopsitta group most readily
available to aviculturists (and this is far from often). The Double-eyed is
about the size of a parrotlet, predominantly leaf green, but with red and
blue head and cheek colourings. There are many subspecies showing small
variations in colour. The members of the genus Psittaculiwstris are much
larger, being about 18 in long (0.46 m), and built like a chubby lovebird.
They are very playful and move like lories, bouncing along the branches
to greet each other when excited. There are three species which comprise
the genus; these are the Edwards 5 Fig Parrot P. edwardsii , the Salvadori
Fig Parrot P. salvadorii and the Desmaresfs Fig Parrot P. desmarestii.
Without giving detailed descriptions of each species, it is sufficient to say
that Edwards 5 has a bright red throat and (in the male) red chest feathers,
while Salvadori's has yellowy green throat feathers, with a band across
the chest which is red in the male and blue in the female, and Desmaresfs
has bright yellowy orange head and cheek feathers. Both Edwards' and
Salvadori's show the typical striated effect on the feathers round the
cheeks and throat, but this is much less evident in Desmaresfs.
Both groups of fig parrots are found in mainly lowland forest in the
Western Papuan Islands and in New Guinea.

<bodyText confidence="0.999267547619047" page_id="56240820"  page_num="84" year="" vol="">
P. desmarestii shows small variations in colouring which have led to
the identification of a number of subspecies. My own pair are P.d. occi-
dentalis , and they lack the blue occiput of the nominate birds. A group
of them seem to have been imported in 1981, and I imagine my pair and
the ones which were the subject of an article by I.H. Mitchell (1982) came
from the same group. Mine came originally from a dealer in Worcester.
They had one previous owner who reported that they had roosted in a
nest-box, but nothing further had happened.
They were housed in an aviary - part of a block - with a flight measur-
ing 15 x 4 x 6 ft (4.57 x 1.21 x 1.83 m) with access to indoor quarters
of 4 x 4 x 6 ft (1.21 x 1.21 x 1.83 m). The aviary was planted with black-
currant bushes and, in the summer, weeds. The birds were supplied with
five or six twiggy apple branches. These were chewed continually and
although replaced whenever possible, the branches were supplemented
with the struts of their aviary, and subsequently with the replacement
struts. Interestingly, the currant bushes were kept pruned, but never
completely destroyed, only the topmost shoots being taken. No nest-
box was provided initially, and the birds spent the winter flying outside
but roosted in the indoor heated flight. In the spring of 1982 a lovebird
nest-box measuring 8 x 8 x 11 in (0.20 x 0.20 x 0.28 m) was hung in the
outside flight, and by the early summer they were sleeping in it and
showing quite a lot of interest in it during the day.
Their diet consisted of chopped fruit (apple, pear, grapes, banana),
mixed parrot seed and two soaked (dried) figs a day. Various kinds of
food have been tried and I find fig parrots in general to be quirky and
individual feeders. Desmarest's will eat sponge cake, but no vegetable
except for a little watercress. Edwards' will take sweetcorn (maize) and
some carrot, but no cake. Although seed and fruit were basic foods, I was
concerned that they were getting little protein. The usual sources of
protein - cheese, egg and meat, bread and milk - were tried and carefully
ignored. Animal protein did seem to be necessary since fig parrots eat
only the seeds of figs, and the large number of insects which live in the
fruit probably form a significant addition to their diet.
In desperation I purchased a hundredweight (51 kg) each of fish meal
and meat meal. These hung around the house for months while the atmos-
phere became less and less distinguishable from that of a 16th century
galleon on a transglobal expedition. The birds would touch nothing that
had contact with either of these delicacies, and I cannot say that I really
blamed them. Mealworms were offered but not taken at this time. Vionate
was sprinkled on to the food, as was grated cuttlefish 'bone' and wheat-
germ. Vitamin K was provided in the form of one-eighth of a tablet of
Synkavit (Roche). This was powdered and sprinkled over the figs twice

weekly. It is said that fig parrots are unable to synthesise Vitamin K, as do
most creatures; rather they need to ingest it from the figs which form a
major part of their diet. Vitamin K is helpful in promoting blood clotting,
and, therefore, in reducing the propensity to haemorrhage which seems to
affect all fig parrots. Rosemary Low, writing of her experiences with a
Salvadori's hen, makes a strong case for using this to prevent haemorrhage
through rupture of the oviduct wall when a bird becomes egg bound, and
the breeder of Edwards' Fig Parrot (1983) said that after losing two hens
he was able to breed successfully after adding Vitamin K to their diet.
Sexing the birds on sight was nearly impossible. One appeared slightly
larger, and definitely more assertive and bossy. I assumed that this was the
male or possibly one of the males. I.H. Mitchell (1983) makes interesting
observations on the difference between sexes. He says '.these longer
(neck) feathers of the cock overlap more of the blue band bordering the
lower neck/upper breast. Hence the blue band on the cock is less broad
and therefore less apparent than that of the hen'. When I applied this dis-
tinction to my birds it seemed far from clear cut. Subsequently, my obser-
vations led me to conclude that in Psittaculirostris, the females are generally
larger and always dominant. This is also true of the genus Opopsitta. Des-
marest's cocks are smaller, have less brightly coloured yellow neck and
cheek feathers and are much less forceful as personalities^ They are also
much more delicate.
Towards the middle of the summer of 1982 the birds became very
much more active and noisy. One would bounce along the perch to tackle
the other by grabbing a leg or the tail, and there was much sportive scuff-
ling and hanging upside down from the roof of the flight with flapping
wings. Both birds were now very much attached to the nest-box and spent
a lot of time playing around the roof of it and climbing in and out. There
seemed to be little serious attempt at sitting, and I was surprised to find
one egg when I took down the box to clean it before winter. This egg was
creamy white, and measured PA in long (0.03 m). It was cold and no sign
of fertility was apparent when it was opened. However, at least it was now
clear that one of the birds was a hen.
The pair wintered over successfully, coming indoors to roost only on
the coldest nights. At that time their nest-box remained outside, but now
I hang the boxes inside, partly because it is warmer, and extreme cold is a
discomfort to be avoided, and partly because the boxes are easier to in-
spect. By March they were sitting again; I had calculated that the incuba-
tion period was about three weeks.
It was difficult to determine exactly when the egg was laid as the nest-
box was so placed that inspection was a major operation involving passing
through several other flights. This remoteness, while frustrating, gave the

birds additional security which they appreciated, I think.
During the March sitting the aviaries were alarmed' and the continual
work and disturbance led to two half-developed embryos which at least
gave hope of future chicks. The hen's behaviour when the eggs failed to
hatch was sad and striking. She was clearly deeply upset - she kept going
in and out of the nest-box and then pursuing the cock round the flight
regurgitating and spitting food at him from a distance of about a foot
(0.30m). By the following day this had stopped but the birds moped on
their perch and were much quieter than previously and obviously depressed.
This hen was possibly experienced and knew what should happen, since
another Desmaresf s hen sat quite happily for over a month and showed
no concern when the eggs were removed.
The third lot of eggs was laid on 7th July and were due to hatch just
before we went on holiday. When the hen failed to appear at the end of
the incubation period it seemed clear that there were chicks or a chick.
As I said at the beginning of this article, the provision of a diet ade-
quate for the rearing of chicks has always been a major problem with
these birds. Previously, as I have said, the Desmaresf s had been offered
mealworms in which they showed little interest. Now, however, during the
July brooding, mealworms started to be taken in increasing quantities.
The birds would husk them, grinding the flesh out and leaving a dry skin.
It was decided to offer as great a variety of food as possible, and so, as
well as mealworms, we also provided wax moth larvae, Cow and Gate
'Fruit Delight' baby food, soaked seed, chopped fruit (apple, banana and
grape) and the usual soaked, dried fig. The wax moths were very deceptive;
an empty container would simply mean that they were snuggling safely
under the floor newspaper. As the chick grew, however, the cock became
better at grabbing them quickly and when the chick was about 10 days
old, we were using about 50 a day, besides the mealworms. Apart from a
little fig, live food was the only thing taken.
Suddenly the food intake dropped, and inspection of the box revealed
a dead, two-week old chick covered with white down. Post mortem
revealed enteritis due, I was sure, to an inadequate diet rather than any
direct infection. This saw the end of breeding for 1983. The hen did not
repeat her distracted behaviour when the chick died.
Over the winter I was exercised over the problem of diet. An afternoon
spent in the library of the Zoological Society of London revealed nothing
at all about Desmarest's as they seemed neither to be kept in scientific
collections, nor to have been the subject of field study.
I obtained a list of fruit importers from the Indonesian Embassy, in the
hope of finding someone who would perhaps import some of the figs
identified by Forshaw in his comments on these birds, but this effort

failed. Various notions about using the larvae of tropical ants foundered
on the impossibility of finding a supplier. However, two important pieces
of additional information partially dispelled the gloom which is the in-
evitable result of avicultural failure. During the autumn, the anonymous
article referred to above was published in the November Parrot Society
Magazine . In it the author described how he reared Edwards' Fig Parrots
by feeding the adults a diet which included figs mixed with Milupa baby
food. The second achievement was that of George Smith who succeeded
in hand-rearing Psittaculirostris salvadori, the first fig parrots ever to be
bred and reared in the U.K. Very generously, his then assistant, Judith
Nicholas, copied out the diet they had used and sent it to me.
In 1984 mating took place around the second week of March. The
birds had been given a new nest-box with a layer of wood shavings in
the bottom. They preferred this box as it was slightly deeper and presu-
mably felt more secure. It was hung outside at the highest point of the
aviary.
A week before the eggs were due to hatch, the seed was removed and
the parents offered chopped fruit as before, plus softened figs mixed with
one teaspoon Heinz 'Bone, Beef and Vegetable Broth'. A pinch of bone
meal, pinch of Vionate and a two drops of Cytacon (B12) were added
(plus one-eighth tablet Synkavit twice a week). Finally, about 15 to 20
mealworms were stirred into the mixture, so that the parents, who were
basically interested in the live food, would have to feed some of the other
foods as well. This diet was fed for the first week, after which a mixture of
fruit and vegetable Milupa products were gradually substituted for the
bottled baby foods. The switch-over took about three days, but proved
no problem for the parents who seemed happy to eat anything which had
mealworms in or on it. Mr. Smith used equal quantities of fruit and vege-
table Milupa, but I found the birds ate more if the mixture was sweeter,
and so used more fruit variety. Throughout the rearing, the birds took very
little chopped fruit (about Vi to % oz [14 to 2 lg] a day) and concentrated
on the fig mixture. When the chicks were about three weeks old a small
dish of soaked sunflower seed was provided each morning and removed at
night to prevent the consumption of any mouldy seeds, since the weather
at this time was warm and humid. The seeds were soaked for 24 hours, and
well rinsed before offering. These were taken also in small quantities (V 2 oz
a day) which gradually increased towards the end of the brooding period.
A few grains of sand were occasionally sprinkled on the seed to provide
some kind of grit although the parents themselves were never seen to
touch grit when it was previously provided.
Food was changed three times a day - once in the morning, again at

about 4.0 p.m. and finally late at night so that it was reasonably fresh for
the early morning feed. The nest-box was inspected on 26th March and
showed two eggs. The early stages of incubation were conducted in a very
relaxed manner, then hen being content to chew branches and generally
sit around, until harried back into the box by the cock. These birds are, as
Mr. Mitchell states in his article, almost entirely arboreal, but the only
time I have seen them on the ground was during the incubation and
rearing period when the hen would peck up something (grit? minerals?)
from the gravel floor of the flight.
By 6th April 1 was sure that the egg or eggs had hatched. The hen
rarely left the box, and on returning to it would look inside and make a
peculiar soft, purring noise before climbing down to the chicks.
An inspection on 9th April revealed two chicks about four days old
with long tufts of white down on them.
It was decided to inspect the nest-box once a week, but in order to
keep some sort of check on whether rearing was proceeding smoothly, all
the food was weighed before and after consumption. In this way it was
hoped that any sudden drop in intake could be investigated, and problems
corrected before they became irremediable. The weighing was necessary
because it was not easy to gauge how much food had been taken, just by
looking at the dish.
Just after hatching, food intake was 2 Vi oz (70 g). In the week before
the chicks left the box, the food taken had risen to 6 % oz (189 g). The
intake graph showed, as one would hope, a steady rise upward, except for
a sharp drop about a week before the chicks were due to fledge. The
amount taken had been between 4 Vi to 5 Vi oz (126 - 154 g) during the
day; however, on 25th May the intake dropped to 3 oz (84 g) and was
again down on 27th May. But as the chicks looked alert and healthy,
nothing was done. The drop in intake was possibly linked with the weight
loss necessary before fledging. This, in fact, occurred on 30th and 31st
May.
Inspection on 26th April, when the chicks were just under three weeks
old, showed them sprinkled with down, and with their eyes open. At
four weeks they had developed pin feathers over the wings, and by six
weeks the yellow pin feathers were showing on their heads. Initially the
parents had kept the nest-box immaculate but as the chicks started pro-
ducing larger quantities of mushy faecal material, the shavings became
damp and slightly smelly. Armed with two baskets, one for chicks and one
with fresh shavings, two newspapers and a plastic flower label for cleaning
out corners, I lifted down the box. The chicks backed into the corners but
were carefully lifted out, placed in a basket and covered by a newspaper.
The nest-box was upended onto the other newspaper,the corners scraped

out as well as possible with the plastic label and the inside dried with a
kitchen paper towel A handful of fresh litter was put in the bottom and
the chicks were returned to their nest. The box was hung up in the same
position and the parents shooed out into the flight. After a rather anxious
five minutes during which the hen flew to the box, peered in, uttered
outraged squawks and flew off again, she was eventually persuaded by the
cock that nothing was radically wrong and disappeared into the entrance
hole. This cleaning process had to be repeated twice a week for the rest
of the brooding time and the parents became increasingly phlegmatic
about it.
It also gave me a chance to weigh the chicks which at five and a half
weeks weighed 2 % oz and 3 oz (77g and 84 g) respectively. By six and a
half weeks they had both gained l A oz (7g). On 30th May the smaller
chick was out of the box, a few pin feathers still showing on its head. The
second chick was peering out through the nest-box entrance. The first
cne spent the day being fed by the cock, and was returned by me to
the box in the evening. Both parents roosted with the chicks. On 31st
May both chicks were out; they were about three-quarters of the size of
the adult birds and were identical to them, except for the fact that they
lacked the brilliant yellow on the heads and cheeks of the adults. In the
babies this was replaced by an apple green colour. The smaller chick
showed very pronounced stripes around the throat and cheeks, and this,
coupled with the fact that it was much less assertive than the other chick
led me to think that it might be a cock, which was, in fact, the case. The
father, after the hen had laid again, passed his days playing with the larger
chick and even started to feed it in a far from paternal way.
The young birds were removed after six weeks, by which time the
second round of eggs was just about due to hatch.
The adult birds never showed any signs of aggression towards the
chicks and behaved impeccably throughout the breeding. They kept the
box as clean as possible and tolerated my interference good humouredly
The incubation period was 23-24 days; the period from hatching to
vacating the nest-box was exactly eight weeks, to the day. Seeing the four
birds in the flight together was a marvellous sight.

BREEDING THE BAR-BREASTED FIRE FINCH
Lagonosticta rufopicta

(Yate, Avon)

This species of fire finch originates from tropical Africa in Senegal,
Gambia, Ghana and acoss a narrow band of central Africa including a
northern part of Uganda.
The Bar-breasted is similar in appearance to the commoner Red-billed
or Senegal Fire Finch L. senegala but with a broader tail and slightly
larger bill.
The name Bar-breasted derives from the small white spots or marks
which give the appearance of very delicate 'bars' across the breast.
The female is very similar to the cock but a slightly duller red.
Three birds were purchased towards the end of 1986; at that time I
was unsure of their sexes but they turned out to be two hens and one
cock.
The birds were over-wintered in a shed with another species of Fire
Finch - the Dark Fire Finch L. rubricata which, incidentally, I have bred
to five generations. These were all housed in an inside flight cage approxi-
mately 2.0 m long x 1.0 m high x 0.5 m deep.
The temperature was kept at approximately 6-8*C during the winter.
The food offered during this period consisted of panicum millet, Japanese
millet, plate millet, yellow millet, and lettuce. Soaked seed, sprinkled with
a mixture of Claus honey insectivorous food and Orlux eggfood was
offered two to three times a week. The actual food taken I cannot be too
sure of.
In the latter part of April 1987, we moved house, so the birds were
housed in cages for two weeks while some aviaries were prepared. The
Bar-breasteds were released into an aviary measuring 1.8 x 1.8 x 1.8 m,
together with two pairs of Australian finches.
Nesting material was provided in the form of hay, chicken feathers,
and coconut fibre. Various nesting receptacles were fixed in the aviary
as well as some large conifer branches which were tied up as at that time
thre were no plants or shrubs growing naturally in the aviary suitable for
nesting in.
A nest was built 1.0 m from the ground, using some of the conifer
branches for support, and made from the materials supplied. It was dome-
shaped with a few feathers lining the nest and one at the entrance as a
door.

Bar-breasted Fire Finch chick, approximately one week after leaving nest
I knew that eggs had been laid but not when or how many as I left
the birds strictly alone. However, it appears that the time from the first
egg being laid to the fledging date is 29 days. The diet was changed to
in-clude live food such as meadow ants, ants' eggs, greenfly and fruit flies.
Three chicks left the nest on 29th July and had difficulty in flying,
spending the first two nights out of the nest, whereas the chicks of the
second clutch returned to the nest for the first four to five days after
fledging. I feel that this second clutch were stronger because they had had
the chance of more live food whilst in the nest.
The chicks were brown in colour and gradually attained the colour of
the adults.
A second nest was made in a hay basket, approximately 1-3 m from the
ground with feathers as a lining.
Four chicks were reared, but one died on the first day of fledging.
So in all, six birds were successfully reared in 1987 which I shall use for
breeding next season having lost the original breeding hen.
As described above, the Bar-breasted Fire Finch Lagonosticta rufopicta has been
bred by Mr, R. Wallis and this is believed to be the first success in this country. Any-
one knowing of a previous breeding in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, or of
any other reason that would disqualify this claim, is asked to inform the Hon.
Secretary.

THE COMMON BRONZEWING PIGEON

The bronzewing pigeons of Australia form a group of ten related
species. Or possibly 8, 9 or 12, depending on whether one or two are
regarded as full species or merely as races and whether the genus Herti-
cophaps, of New Guinea and New Britain, should be included with them.
These pigeons are a beautiful example of adaptive radiation. Their
colour patterns, sexual behaviour and distribution all indicate phylo-
genetic affinity but there are several genera, some of which differ much
in shape and proportions from the others, these differences being due to
adaptations to different habitats and/or ways of life. They take their
name from the iridescent markings on their wings. These are most brilliant
and extensive in the Common Bronzewing Phaps chalcoptera , and more
or less obsolete in the Australian rock pigeons, Petrophassa.
In this article I propose to say something about the Common Bronze-
wing. This is not only the most widely distributed of all the bronzewings,
it is also the most beautiful and one of the most frequently kept and
bred in captivity outside its native land.
The Common Bronzewing is about the size of a smallish domestic
pigeon but with proportionately broader and more rounded body (due to
thicker feathering) and smaller head. Its forehead is creamy buff to reddish
buff, bordered at the back with purple which extends along each side of
the head behind the eye. There is a dark stripe from bill to eye and a white
or cream stripe under it that runs along the side of the head. The sides of
the neck are bluish grey, the throat whitish and the breast a beautiful rich
mauvish pink, shading to pale rufous to pale buff edges to most feathers,
giving a laced or mottled effect. The wing coverts, or most of them, are
partly bluish grey, with large iridescent spots or patches which appear
emerald green, bronzy red or dark golden but similar iridescent markings
on the secondaries appear purplish red and bluish green. These iridescent
markings form bars across the folded wings in the living birds, very dif-
ferent from the jumble of spots they sometimes appear in museum skins
or in the works of bird artists who have drawn only from such skins. As
with many pigeons that have conspicuous display plumage on the wings,
these glossy areas are not visible from directly above when the bird is
not displaying them. The underwing coverts and axilliaries are light chest-
nut. The outer tail feathers are bluish grey with dark terminal bands, the
central pair brown. The iris is dark brown or reddish brown with a narrow

fleshy grey orbital skin; the bill purplish black and the feet and legs pur-
plish pink.
The hen has a greyish forehead, little or no purple on the head and a
buffish drab breast at best merely tinged with pink. In many but not all
hens the glossy wing markings, though as brilliant as the cock's, never
look red or golden in any light.
The young are duller with at first no iridescence on the wing and both
sexes (fide Nicolai) have buff foreheads until the first moult.
In the field, or rather in the bush, this bird's plumage is very concealing
but, if one knows what one is looking for, the white facial streaks some-
times give a pair away as they stand quietly in the shade of some bush,
ready to fly if the observer gets too near. At such times the (otherwise)
shining wing markings often look a dark and glossless olive green. As does
the brilliant green wing patch of our Teal Anas crecca, when seen in deep
shade or under an overcast sky.
When seen in flight from above the bird looks a general darkish brown,
unless the iridescent areas catch the light which, strangely, they seldom
seem to do. When the bird is passing more or less at eye level or above,
yet not silhouetted against the light, the warm chestnut underwing is
conspicuous like the, respectively, reddish and golden underwing coverts
of our Redwing Turdus iliacus and Song Thrush T. philomelos.
The Common Bronzewing is found over most of Australia and Tas-
mania being, in general, absent only from the wettest and densest wood-
lands and from built up areas. There are good photographs of the habi-
tats of this and other species in Frith's fine book on Australian pigeons.
This species gives the impression of being, as Frith claims that it is, the
most generalised species of its group and the one most close to the (pre-
sumed) common ancestor of the bronzewing group. Another possibility,
which would go far to explain its drinking habits, and which I suggested
in my pigeon book (p. 152/3) is that the Common Bronzewing evolved
in the interior of Australia during a period of considerable aridity when
it (or its ancestors) suffered intense predation from birds of prey when
coming to sources of water. Nowadays the Common Bronzewing is found
in various types of woodland (most types of Australian woodland* being
rather open by European standards), dry scrubland, open country with
shrubs or trees and partly cultivated areas.
It feeds and spends much time on the ground. Seeds of many kinds
are taken, including cultivated grains, especially wheat, when available.
In the dry interior the seeds of mulga trees Acacia spp, often figure largely
in its diet. Newman (1929) who bred this species very successfully in the
'golden days' of aviculture prior to the First World War, wrote: 'They do
well on the usual larger grains and seeds supplied to pigeons, and are fond

of cut-up peanuts, and will eat some of the soft fruits, such as the wine-
berry'. I do not, I am afraid, know what a wine-berry is. A more modern
breeder of wild pigeons (Nicolai, 1969) says that a more varied and com-
plicated diet is necessary and should include white millet, canary seed,
dari, wheat, hemp and maw seed, all of which must be given in separate
dishes, also a 'woodbird mixture' (Waldvogel Mischfutter), greenfood,
berries, and eggfood when breeding. When feeding young he says the
latter are very prone to rickets so the adults must be given sprouted millet
treated with cod liver oil and the young must be given in addition, by hand
a gelatine capsule of cod liver oil (presumably daily).
Having no experience of keeping this bird I will merely add that I
would do as I have successfully done in the past with other pigeons and
scatter the dry seed given to them on and among sawdust, leafmould or
other such substrate in a fairly clean part of the aviary, thus giving the
birds some interest and exercise when feeding. I hope that members who
currently keep this and/or allied species will give us their experiences and
advice.
The Common Bronzewing usually drinks in the late evening, just after
sunset, some individuals not doing So until it is nearly dark. Like most pig-
eons they tend to feed most intensively in the late afternoon and to go to
drink with full crops. They fly fast and low from their living areas and may
fly straight to the drinking place or alight and wait at a distance before
making a second flight towards the water but commonly they first alight
about 100 or 200 yards (91 to 182m) from the drinking place, wait there
for some time, perhaps until a number have gathered together and then
walk to the drinking place. When in Australia I was able several times to
watch Bronzewings coming to drink at a cattle trough in the dry interior.
To quote what I wrote elsewhere (Goodwin, 1978): 'It was nearly dark
and, straining my eyes, I could suddenly see .pigeons, dozens upon
dozens of them, not line abreast but in little hesitant groups, walking over
the ground and converging towards the trough. I think they did not see
well in the very dim light, for they walked with their heads not nodding to
and fro but held straight forward, as a Domestic Pigeon does when it is
forced to walk in darkness. They were nervous and alert; each bird would
take a dozen or so paces then stop. Each time one stopped its nervousness
affected others, which stopped also, each time one moved forwards others
were encouraged to follow.each bird flew up to the trough.

noisily away.

had assuaged its thirst. I do not think it is being anthropomorphic to be-
lieve that a Bronzewing Pigeon coming to drink is as apprehensive as it
appears to be and that it must experience great relief as it flies back to the
relative safety of its distant home in the scrub.'
The Common Bronzewing builds the usual pigeon nest of twigs, stems,
etc., on some horizontal or near horizontal support in a tree or shrub,
sometimes in a hollow of a tree or rock or on a rock ledge or on the ground.
Frith states that the main breeding season is from November to February
but nesting has been recorded at all times of year. The clutch consists of
two white eggs, as in many pigeons.
The bowing display of this bird is similar to that of most bronzewings,
the wings are partly spread and tilted forwards to show the iridescent
markings and the tail is raised. There is a complicated and seemingly very
spectacular mating ceremony which was long ago described in detail
(Whitman, 1919) but which I have never had the fortune to see.
The advertising coo is a deep, low-pitched oom-oom suggestive of the
lowing of cattle. There are several other cooing and clucking calls (Frith,
Goodwin 1983, Whitman).
There is a beautiful and accurate coloured plate of a pair of these birds
by H. Goodchild in the Avicultural Magazine for January 1929 and pic-
tures and photographs of the birds and their habitats in Frith's book.
Though the Common Bronzewing appears (Frith) to have adapted well
to the present degree of human impact upon Australia, this is no cause for
complacency among aviculturists, the more so as the species cannot be
legally exported. It is to be hoped that all aviculturists in a position to do
so will endeavour to perpetuate and disseminate it. And, I would add, fight
against any endeavour by the show fanciers to distort its appearance and
ruin its beauty as they have done so devastatingly with another lovely Aus-
tralian species, the Budgerigar.

Eudocimus ruber
By RICHARD HUGHES and ANDREW OWEN
(Padstow Bird Gardens, Cornwall)
The Scarlet Ibis is approximately 21-27 in (0.53-0.69 m) in length, the
males being slightly larger. The general plumage colour is bright scarlet but
this tends to fade to a paler red in captivity. The primaries are black, legs
and facial skin red, eyes dark and bill horn coloured (black in the breeding
season).
It is found in the mangrove swamps, estuaries and mud flats on the
north-east coast of South America and Trinidad. It feeds on fish, frogs,
crabs and other crustaceans which it probes for in the mud with its long
bih.
Housing and feeding
Five individuals are housed in a large flight measuring 40 x 20 x 20 ft
(12.19 x 6.09 x 6.09 m) together with a pair of Violet Plantain-eaters, Red-
headed Laughing Thrushes and Black-winged Stilts. Our group consists of
one breeding pair, an old male and a second pair which have become estab-
lished this year (1986), the female of which was hand-reared here in 1983
This article supplements the information given by Kevin Evans on that
achievement (AviculturalMagazine , Vol. 89, 4:215-217).
The flight is attractively planted with Leycesteria formosa, various
conifers and a large forsythia bush (approximately 15 ft - 4.57 m) which
forms the main nesting site for the Ibis. Two concrete ponds are situated
in the flight in which the Ibis regularly bathe and wash their food.
They are fed on a diet of chopped, day-old chicks, Flamingo Pellets,
ox heart and live food. They also probe in the soil for earthworms and
occasionally catch the odd frog or Slow Worm during the summer months.
Breeding
The breeding season usually commences in mid-spring (depending on
the weather) with the breeding birds pairing up and spending a lot of time
together, away from the rest of the group. When in breeding condition
the colour of the beak changes from pinkish horn to black and the overall
plumage becomes a brighter red. Prior to nest-building the male can be
seen collecting and carrying twigs and other vegetation. These are some-
times carried to the female and copulation soon follows, often on and
around the prospective nest-site. This is observed regularly from about a

week before nest-building commences.
If the weather is mild, large amounts of twigs are placed in the aviary.
The male selects a beakful of suitably sized twigs and then carries them to
the waiting female which constructs the nest. The comparatively small nest
(approximately 12 in in diameter - 0.30 m) is completed within about
three days. This is lined with clumps of grass and green leafy twigs. We
have found that the Ibis prefer to build their own nest in the forsythia as
opposed to using the artificial nesting sites, baskets, etc.
The clutch of 2-3 eggs is normally laid within a couple of days after
completion of the nest. The eggs, which are laid every 48 hours, vary in
colour from pale sky blue with slight brown speckles to dull grey-green
with heavy brown blotches.
The first egg of the clutch of three was laid on 30th April 1986. The
female carries out the majority of the incubation, which begins from the
laying of the first egg, whilst the male remains close at hand. Occasionally
the male carries up food for the female and fresh greenery to reline the
nest.
Over the previous two seasons, chicks have hatched only to be thrown
out of the nest shortly afterwards. It was therefore decided to remove the
first clutch of eggs for hand-rearing. These were taken at the 18th day of
incubation.
Artificial incubation and hand-rearing
The eggs were placed in a small Curfew incubator at a temperature of
100*F at a regular humidity of about 60%. They werQ turned 180* three
times daily up until 21st May when one egg began pipping. The egg
hatched the following day after an incubation period of 23 days. The
remaining two eggs proved to be infertile.
On hatching the chick's eyes were closed and it was covered in thick,
black down; its legs and feet were pink witfi black toenails. The short,
straight beak was pink, tipped with black with a white egg tooth. Tiny
black hooks were noticed on each alula.
Its diet consisted of the following:
15 shelled snails
A handful of mealworms
One tablespoonful of Liver Kit-E-Kat and Fish Catkins cat foods
Two crushed calcium lactate tablets
A sprinkling of Vionate
Two tablespoonfuls of water
All this was liquidised and pushed through a fine sieve to remove any
fragments of shell. It was then stored in a refrigerator and small quantities

were removed and warmed for feeding.
The first feed was given at 10.30 p.m. - ten hours after hatching - when
1 Vi ml was fed through a small syringe with soft rubber tubing attached.
This was given at hourly intervals for the first day. The chick was fed
throughout the night for the first week, the length of time between feeds
gradually being increased.
Day to day record of development
Day 2: Eyes partially open and is making a shrill squeak whilst being
fed. 3 mis is now being fed every two hours.
Day 3: Shuffling around on haunches. Attempting to preen chest.
Day 4: Legs beginning to turn grey whilst feet remain pink. Pin feathers
starting to appear under the skin on the wings. Black 'smudge' ring around
base of beak.
Day 5: 'Smudge' mark is getting wider. Eyes opening more whilst feed-
ing. Pin feathers erupting on wings and beginning to show beneath the skin
on the back. Feet beginning to turn grey. Preening back and chest. Now
capable of supporting its head for short periods of time (10 seconds).
Faint beginnings of another ring appearing on lower mandible about half-
way along the beak.
Day 6: Pin feathers protruding on wings, back and shoulders. Seen
pecking at objects for the first time (e.g. kitchen roll). Preening more
often. 8ml of food being given every two hours. Missed out at 3.00 a.m.
Day 7: Growing rapidly, legs and feet are now black. Now able to sit
up for longer periods. Very inquisitive, often seen looking around, stretch-
ing and pecking at thermometer.
Day 8: Standing up, stretching wings and preening underside. Moved
him to a larger tray as he is growing so quickly. This is lined with twigs
to enable him to grip and exercise his feet. 14 ml being given every 2Vi
hours.
Day 9: Black band across bill becoming more pronounced. Feet are
noticeably larger, often pecking at feet. Calls whenever he sees us. Bare
skin around the eyes is darker grey. 20-25 ml being fed every three hours.
Food is now mixed slightly thicker.
Day 10: Beak longer and slightly downcurved. Pin feathers erupting
all over body. Swallowed the rubber tubing which was attached to the
syringe at 9.00 a.m. No ill effects noticed. Hopefully it will pass straight
through.
Day 11: Tubing passed through whilst being weighed at 6.00 a.m. Pin
feather emerging on the front of his neck. Screams incessantly when
hungry.
Day 12: Black rings beginning to merge at the base of the beak.

Feather quills on belly and rump are pale grey.
Day 13: Vanes emerging from tips of quills. Egg tooth is still visible.
Raised the lid of the incubator (a) to give more height for him to stretch,
and (b) to lower the temperature.
Day 14: Feathers on rump and underside white or pale grey, all
others are black.
Day 15: Standing up a lot now. Clambering around the incubator.
30-35 mis now being taken. Food being mixed into a thicker, creamy
consistency.
Day 16: Bill much longer. Moved out of the incubator during the day
as he is now too big. Put in a cardboard box with a very low perch and
his nest tray with the twigs for its feet to grip on. Put back into the
incubator at night. Egg tooth gone.
Day 19: Calling loudly and shaking his wings vigorously when being
fed, also makes a strange honking noise.
Day 20: Exercising his wings a lot.
Day 21: Given one or two baby (pink) mice with each feed of 40 ml.
Now able to climb on to the top edge of the cardboard box.
Day 22: Eating crickets and mealworms, picks up baby mice and
pieces of ox heart but he only shakes these about and drops them.
Day 25: Black tail feathers showing through a white rump. Given
last syringe feed today. Now being hand fed on ox heart, pieces of skinned
chick, flamingo pellets and pink mice. Still only picking up live food.
Day 29: Tail feathers growing well. Beak growing longer, more down
curved. Constantly screaming for food. Being fed slightly less often to
encourage it to feed itself.
Dat 30: Given its first unskinned chick.
Day 32: Brought up his first pellet.
Day 38: Pin feathers showing on head, baby down gradually disap-
pearing.
Day 39: Perching on one leg when resting. Still only picking up live
food.
Day 42: Put out into shed as he is now able to fly. Did not feed all
day, brought in at night and immediately started begging for food.
Day 43: Picking up live food whilst in shed so he was left out all
night.
Day 44: Alright this morning. Began picking at inanimate food.
Watched him from outside the shed. Seems as though he is totally weaned.
At the time of submitting this article (September 1987), the young
Ibis is almost in full adult plumage and is now living in the flight with
the adult birds, where he has been since last summer.

THE PARROTS OF LUQUILLO
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98517072972973" page_id="56240837"  page_num="101" year="" vol="">
Published by Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology (1100 Glendon
Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90024) at 29.50 US dollars.
Possibly the most intensively studied parrot in the wild is the highly
endangered Puerto Rican Parrot Amazona vittata. Three of the biologists
who have worked with this species during the past 16 years or so, Noel
Snyder, James Wiley and Cameron Kepler, joined forces to produce The
Parrots of Luquillo: Natural History and Conservation of the Puerto
Rican Parrot.
Nearly 400 pages of small type (double column) provide an absorbing
insight into this species. Its decline and conservation have been followed
for two decades by those who are passionately Interested in parrot conser-
vation. Now much, but not all, of this fascinating story is unfolded.
The historical decline is vividly documented in the second chapter. One
can only speculate on the former size of the population of vittata; it may
have exceeded one million. Today there are 34 known In the wild (Sept-
ember count - 41 in June). Only four breeding pairs survive.
The third chapter Is also of historical interest, describing what is known
of the extinct parrots of the West Indies and speculating on the origins
of the Puerto Rican Parrot. The conclusion reached is that agilis or vermahs
were involved in its ancestry.
The following chapter describes the Luquillo forest,, to which vittata is
confined today, the species 5 movements and food, its nest sites, repro-
ductive biology and natural enemies.
Chapters 9 to 11 discuss Its recent decline, conservation efforts and the
captive breeding programme. The last two chapters are not covered in the
detail of those preceding them; much available information was not inclu-
ded. It was necessary, because of the immense volume of data analysed, to
use field data up to 1979 only. Subsequent breeding seasons are covered in
Chapter 12, Epilogue and view to the future. Almost 100 pages of appen-
dices provide information on a wide variety of aspects, from measurements
of Greater Antillean Amazon Parrots to foods eaten by vittata in the
Luquillo forest.
This book is an often depressing account of a parrot whose decline has
been halted - but not reversed. Most readers would believe that vittata was
doomed to extinction.
Since the publication of this book, however, there have been encouraging
developments regarding the personnel who oversee the conservation pro-

THE QUAILS, PARTRIDGE AND FRANCOLINS OF THE WORLD
By Paul A. Johnsgard. 1988. Oxford University Press. 260 pp. Price #49.
Although only a proof copy, with all its inherent faults, was forwarded
by the publishers for review, the old adage 'Never judge a book by its
cover' has never been more applicable. Two green covered, spiral bound
volumes and a heap of colour plates lay before me with a note stating pro-
duction of proofs was undertaken on a photocopying machine and does
not represent finished printing, quality or dimensions. Needless to say, the
finished product will be comparable with the high standards set by previous
Johnsgard/O.U.P. volumes.
But what of the most important aspect of any book - content quality?
Without doubt this volume will become the standard reference source on
these three groups for a good many years to come. A total of one hundred
and thirty-four species are covered in the main body of text, each being
broken down into a number of separate categories including subspecies,
distribution, measurements, indentification, general biology and ecology,
social behaviour, reproductive biology, evolutionary relationships and
status and conservation outlook. Introductory chapters cover aspects of
comparative biology which, because of species diversity, has to be kept
to within limitations. The whole is interspersed with tables, maps and line
drawings.
A feature that we now come to expect from monographic coverage is
the illustration, in colour, of all species represented in the text. This book
is no exception and for the first time one is able to view every species of
quail, partridge and francolin. The bulk of the plates were painted by
Major Henry Jones and made available through the Zoological Society of
London's Library. Outstanding species were covered by Timothy Green-
wood and Mark Marcus, painted specifically to make the coverage com-
plete.
Reading through some of the species accounts, missing data must
surely be available through aviculture. For example, no incubation period
is given for Erckel's Francolin, a species frequently kept and bred in
captivity - whether this is a lapse by the author in his research or the
apathetic approach aviculturists have for recording data, it has still to be
recorded. Likewise, a description of the type of nest used by the Javan

Hill Partridge is lacking; several built in captivity have been of the domed
type, even though pens have been devoid of low, dense vegetation. All
workers, be they naturalists, conservationists or aviculturists, now have a
summary of what is known about these interesting groups within the
galliformes and should make every effort to record relevant date when it
becomes known.
Overall, this is an excellent book and one that is highly recommended.

By Freddie and Dulcie Cooke. Published by Blandford Press (Cassell),
London. Price #15.95 (hard cover). ISBN 0 7137 1961 3. 160 pp.
Dulcie and Freddie Cooke are very well known to British members as
great supporters of the Avicultural Society and I cannot remember a
meeting of the Society which they did not attend - always interested and
appreciative. For some years Dulcie Cooke has contributed excellent
articles in Cage and Aviary Birds on cockatiels and is now writing about
other psittacine species. She recently wrote about hand-rearing an Um-
brella Cockatoo in our magazine.
The Cookes have distilled their lifelong experience with Cockatiels
into this excellent book which really does tell readers all they need to
know about keeping and breeding these attractive birds. It contains a
wealth of information and the practical advice is written in a very clear
and informative style, illustrated with line drawings, and there is a set of
excellent colour photographs by Dennis Avon.
The book provides details of the cockatiel's wild origins, colour mu-
tations, general management, housing, training and breeding with genetic
details and cross-breeding charts never previously published in book form.
Special chapters cover topics such as incubation, hand-rearing, feeding and
nutrition, hygiene. Veterinary surgeon Alan Jones contributes a special
chapter on cockatiel diseases and their prevention.
A useful appendix acquaints the reader with tips on show standards
(worldwide) and also literature and addresses of useful organisations.
In all, this book is a most valuable guide, highly recommended, and
beautifully produced at a very reasonable price.

The special subject in Section I of this volume is Aquatic Exhibits, last
covered in the Yearbook in 1964 since when there has been great develop-
ment in aquatic management and in the ingenuity of aquatic exhibits, in
zoos and public aquaria. The exhibits described in Volume 26 extend over
an enormous range of aquarium design and construction. At one end of
the spectrum are the massive and beautiful coral reef tanks, and at the
other end are the small but effective specialised aquaria. The range of
animal types covered is also great, with living corals at one end and pinni-
peds at the other. In between are quite a number of papers on penguin and
seabird facilities, with the Penguinarium at San Diego Zoo being the most
impressive. There Emperor and King Penguins are maintained in a magni-
ficent environment to which masses of snow is added daily, and both
species have been successfully bred.
Section 2 presents papers on the breeding and management of a con-
siderable number of rare and interesting species, including the Cassowary
Pesquet's Parrot and Humboldt Penguin. There is a very interesting article
on breeding the African Pygmy Goose in the Hong Kong Zoological and
Botanic Gardens written by Dr. K.C. Searle, Vice President of the Avi-
cultural Society.. Section 3 consists of an updated list of zoos and aquaria
with an index of zoo names, lists of vertebrates bred in captivity during
1984 and a census of rare animals.
Some Recent Books on Natural History Illustration
Many members who collect paintings and books about natural history
may be interested in the following titles, mostly about birds but some of
them also include botanical illustrations:
TO SAIL BEYOND THE SUNSET
By C.M. Finney. Published by Rigby International.#25.
An account of the development of the study of natural history in
Australia from 1699 to 1829. Includes extracts from contemporary logs,
journals and letters and the text is accompanied by a magnificent collec-
tion of over one hundred illustrations, both colour and black and white,
including reproductions of works by such notable early natural history
draughtsmen as Bauer, Westall and Brown. A beautiful book which would
make a most acceptable present. It is also remarkably good value.

' At the moment (December 1987) my pair of Bengal Eagle Owls have
small chick(s) and the old pair of Brazilian Rusty-barred Owls are incuba-

'This year I have made considerable efforts to exchange home-bred
owls with several foreign collections, public and private, and although I
could write several volumes on the problems I have encountered, some
success has been achieved. In this way some of the species which had
become very inbred have been strengthened by an introduction of new
blood and several new species have been added to British aviculture. So
far the following importations have been arranged by some of my friends

'From&amp;apos; Antwerp Zoo we received three Turkmenian Eagle Owls and
two African Spotted Eagle Owls Bubo africanus africanus.

The Plains Wanderer Pedionomus torquatus has appeared in these pages
on several occasions. Believed at one stage to be one of Australia's rarest
birds, research in the last three years has proved that it is far more numer-
ous than previously thought. In a 60,000 hectare study area, over 400
birds were leg banded.
An interesting article by Tim Inskipp in Traffic (Vol. 9 no. 1) on
Hummingbird trade and protection contains a wealth of interest on a
variety of aspects of this large family. A breakdown of known consign-
ments into several European countries is given, while at the end a list of all
species is given with a summary of their status in the countries in which
they occur.
The Helmeted Woodpecker Dryocopus galeatus, the rarest of South
American woodpeckers, has been reliably sighted for the first time in
decades. Researcher Edwin Willis observed a female in western Sao Paulo,
Brazil; other unconfirmed reports come from eastern Paraguay.
Observers of the autumn 1986 migration at Beidaihe Hebe province,
China, counted a grand total of 2,729 Oriental Storks Ciconia boyciana
between 11th October and 16th November; this represents more than
twice the previous world population estimates.
Another stork to show some promise is the Storm's Woolly-necked
Stork Ciconia episcopus stormi which has just been found nesting in
Thailand. Not only a new bird for the country, but it represents a major
range extention northwards for this threatened species. The nest con-
tained two young.

the lives and work of the great avicultural collectors such as Wilfred Frost
Cecil S. Webb, Fred Shaw-Mayer, etc. His article on Walter Goodfellow
(Vol. 92, No. 4, page 220) has resulted in several letters with personal
recollections from members and we believe, therefore, that readers would
be interested to read more about the earlier days of aviculture. Alan would

Dieter Schmidl has written from the Max-Planck-lnstitut, Seewiesen,
Germany, about a female Forest Weaver Ploceus bicolor sclateri (Roberts)
which was hand-reared from the second day after hatching to sexual
maturity.
' This afforded the first description of all aspects of this species' early
development (nestling and juvenile plumage, juvenile moult), behaviour
(social, foraging, comfort and breeding) and song and duet develop-
ment. In order to distinguish innate from learned song, the human foster
parent constantly whistled a folk song to the young bird and observed the
result. The song was copied, which indicWec learning, as has been recorded
in the song-whistling Bullfinch Pyrrhula pyrrhula. A close bond between
young and parents or substitute-parent is necessary for such learning,
denoting imprinting. Learned song elements are presented.
'Song development is remarkably slow. Increased synchronisation with
playback of a recorded song on a tape loop indicates that adjustment to
the partner is attempted in duetting. Singing in unison does not seem to
have family-bonding function.

Keeping and breeding full-winged ducks in aviaries
The following observations may be of interest since the fertility, in
my experience, is so much higher.
In Mitchell Park Gardens we have several large aviaries planted fairly
thickly with subtropical plants.
Several species of duck, especially the perching kind such as Rajah
Shelduck Tadorna rajah , Hartlaub's Duck Cairina hardaubi , Ringed Teal
Callonetta leucophrys, Chestnut-breasted Teal Anas castanea , Mandarin
Ducks Aix galericulata, Carolina Wood Duck A. sponsa are highly suitable
for display in this kind of environment if left full-winged and not pinioned.
They are far more active exhibits and are prolific breeders if kept in
groups and free-flying.
The rare and beautiful Hartlaub's Duck which I have not yet succeeded
in breeding, spend a lot of time flying from perch to perch, but can
become very aggressive in spring. Our pair would not tolerate rails or
moorhens or even pheasants in the aviary and on one occasion a full-
winged Ringed Teal that found its way in through a hole in the neigh-
bouring aviary was hunted down by the Hartlaub drake and killed. If any
reader knows where I can obtain more of this species, 1 would very much
like to hear from them for these ducks would do very well in this climate
of Durban and we have just lost our one female so are now down to one
male.
The Ringed Teal have been very prolific, hatching broods of up to 15
ducklings which they rear themselves. Mandarin ducks have even hatched
up to 23 ducklings in one go and 17 ducklings in one hatch is quite
common.
This year, from one Moluccan Rajah Shelduck (1987/1988 - your
winter, our summer), which laid four clutches of eggs we have reared 30
healthy ducklings. The original drake died after the first clutch of nine
eggs was laid so we replaced him with another, unrelated, adult drake, at
the same time as removing the eggs and placing them under a Pekin Ban-
tam hen - whereupon within a week the duck went to nest again and laid
eight more fertile eggs. The fact that they paired up so quickly, both
having previously had pair bonds, amazed me and we reared another eight
ducklings. We took the eggs away after the duck had sat on them for 10
days or so because the Occipital Blue Magpies in the aviary would kill the
newly hatched ducklings, as they had done on a previous occasion, but
they do not seem to bother about the eggs in the duck box.
Of the third clutch of eggs only five ducklings hatched and were reared,
and out of a fourth clutch eight ducklings hatched out of eight eggs and all

were reared, making 30 ducklings reared altogether.
All the perching ducks like nesting up high in the holes of trees and
cliffs so duck nesting boxes or logs placed high under the roof suit them
perfectly.
Perching ducks, being woodland and forest dwellers, are agile and
manoeuvrable in flight and very adaptable to the confined conditions of a
planted aviary. I have tried non-perching species of duck and found Hot-
tentot Teal quite at home flying in a confined space. Hawaian Geese also
are quite at home on rockeries but they are such terrible browsers of
plants in preference to grass that I had to end that experiment. In con-
trast to the prolificy of this one Moluccan Rajah Shelduck, mentioned
above, the other pairs of pinioned Rajah Shelduck did not even go to nest
last year and they have nest-boxes placed a few feet off the ground and
tunnels to explore, but we have found them spasmodic breeders in com-
parison to the full-winged birds. All the shelduck bred here in the Park
are of the same blood line.

British softbill imports

Jeffrey Trollope's notes on British softbill imports (Volume 93, 3: 171-
173) are a worthwhile effort to record some of the interesting birds avail-
able to aviculturists in recent years, which will undoubtedly be of great
interest in the future. 1 would like to add a few species to Mr. Trollope's
list, all of which have been imported into Britain in the 1980s. Some of
the corvids below do appear on his list, but I repeat them as it is not clear
to me whether they are included there as present or absent among the
species imported.

While I share with many other aviculturists the excitement of seeing
importers' lists with new, rare and beautiful species, I wonder increasingly
whether we deserve these birds. Two pages on from Mr. Trollope's article
is a note about the effects of the bird trade on the populations of some of
Taiwan's endemic softbills. One of these, the White-eared Sibia (an easily-
managed species), has nowbeen regularly imported for at least four or five
years, but I have yet to see a captive breeding record. Does this suggest
that softbill breeders are generally incompetent, or perhaps that there is
less interest in breeding than is often supposed? Certainly many imported
softbills are destined for the showbench or for mixed aviaries not main-
tained primarily for breeding. The truth is that there are simply not
enough people seriously committed to breeding to establish more than a
small fraction of the species currently available. The number and variety
of birds imported distracts many potential breeders who would achieve
much better results if not presented with so much temptation to diversify
their collections and overcrowd their aviaries. Inevitably breeders concen-
trate their efforts on those species unavailable or infrequently available
from the wild.
Some readers are no doubt thinking, &amp;apos;Hewston has White-eared Sibias
which haven't bred, and other birds he'd do better with if they were kept
on their own'. 1 do not claim to be perfect, but I do feel that it is time,
when considering the pros and cons of the trade in wild birds as we must
do, to stop fooling ourselves about our motives for keeping birds and the
potential for captive breeding. I look forward to Part 2 of Jeffrey Trol-
lope's notes.

On Saturday, 19th March, 1988, nearly 80 members and their guests
attended the spring meeting at the Society's headquarters at Warren Hill,
Hartley Wintney. After a buffet lunch Mr. David Frank, curator at Leeds
Castle, Maidenhead, Kent, gave an interesting talk on birds in Califor-
nia, illustrated by some excellent slides, after which he very kindly invited
Avicultural Society members to visit the new aviaries and the Castle on
Saturday, 6th August, 1988. Further details will be circulated later.
At this meeting Miss Ruth Ezra, President, presented the Avicultural
Society's Medal to Mr. A. Brooker and Mr. A. Griffiths for the first suc-
cessful breeding in Great Britain of the Chestnut Sparrow and the Pale-
headed Mannikin, respectively. Other Certificates and Medals have been
posted.
Council Meeting
At the Council Meeting which preceeded this function, Mrs. Rosemary
Wiseman was elected a member of Council. The Society's Medal was
awarded to Mr. J. Trollope for the first breeding of the Japanese White-
eye Zosterops japonica , no previous record in Great Britain having been
traced.

The Council has decided that, in view of the requirements of the Data
Protection Act, under which the Society is now registered, and the
growing number of members who are very concerned about theft of
valuable birds, the Society will no longer publish a list of members, and
new members' addresses and changes of address will not be printed on the

Promotion
A very attractive advertisement for the Society, carved on Welsh slate,
has now been placed in a prominent position at Birdworld, Farnham,
Surrey. Other production methods are being investigated. Donations are
needed to pay for more of these plaques to be placed in British bird gar-

Error in end papers, 1987
Members may have noticed that a page of advertisements was printed
by error on the back of end paper No. ix, in Volume 93, No. 4, 1987. This
will be a very obvious mistake to members who have their Magazines
bound, when the end papers are put at the beginning of the volume, and,
therefore, the printers have supplied us with some copies of this page with
the reverse blank. Any members who would like a copy (free of charge)
should please apply to the Hon. Secretary.

and TREY TODD (Curator of Birds)
The Secretary Bird, traditionally classified as an aberrant falconiform
species, inhabits grassland savannah throughout most of sub-Saharan
Africa, Primarily cursorial, it stalks through grass to flush its prey of
insects and small vertebrates which it may stun or kill with stamping blows
of its feet. Nesting usually occurs in low trees, both sexes performing
parental duties. A normal clutch comprises two or three eggs, which are
usually incubated for some 45 days.
Single successful captive hatchings have occurred at Vogelpark Wals-
rode, Germany (Wennrich, 1984) and at Tierpark Berlin (W. Grammt,
pers. comm.), but despite numerous specimens exhibited in the United
States, no offspring had been reared prior to the bird reared at Oklahoma
City Zoo in 1986.
Captive history at the Oklahoma City Zoo
The breeding pair of birds has been housed together since 1981 (the
year of the female's arrival) in several locations in the Zoo including two
large pens (6m x 18m and 3.5m x 13.5m) in an off-exhibit area. The diet
consisted of rodents, day-old chicks, and a commercially prepared bird, of-
prey diet. In these pens several infertile clutches of eggs were produced in
ground nests located among grasses in March and May 1984 and March
1985.
On 24th March 1986, a single egg was laid and removed for artificial
incubation in an attempt to induce the parents to lay another clutch. This
proved fertile but failed to hatch. A second egg was not laid in this clutch.
Artificial Incubation
On 23rd April another egg was laid and removed. Regrettably it was
necessary to move the birds from their off-exhibit pen to a large antelope

exhibit immediately after this egg was laid. On 27th April a second egg
was found and removed for artificial incubation. Both eggs of this clutch
proved fertile and developed well in a Humidaire incubator, Model 300A,
set at 36.9*C, and an average wet-bulb reading of 30.5*C. One embryo
died immediately prior to hatching, but on 7th June, after a 42-day incu-
bation period, with an egg weight loss of just under 12%, a healthy chick
hatched from the second egg. Its initial weight was 87g, its body was
covered with white down, and its eyes were open, though sight appeared
poorly developed. The sternal protrusion was pronounced, and the small,
weak legs provided little lateral stability. To increase support, a cloth
towel was crumpled on either side of the chick and this arrangement was
placed inside a bowl in a brooder box equipped with a heating pad. The
ambient air temperature was adjusted to 35*C.

The first feed of chopped, new-born mice (2.5g) was offered on forceps
approximately 18 hours after hatching. The chick immediately showed
itself capable of raising its head and snapping at the food. A second feeding
was given four hours later.
On day two ; the brooder temperature was lowered to 32*C. The
chick's weight was now 83.6g. A routine of five feedings per day was
established, chopped new-born mice being fed exclusively until day four,
when chopped, day-old chicks were introduced and alternated with the
mice. The fifth feeding was then deleted.
On day five the nestling's feet and hock joints appeared swollen with
uniform constricted areas on the rapidly lengthening tarsi apparently
resulting from abnormal dessication of the scutes. Concerned by the
unusual appearance of the bird's legs, we began applying A &amp; D ointment
to the affected areas. By day nine the affected scutes had sloughed off, the
constrictions had disappeared, and the tarsi appeared normal. The chick
also cast a pellet for the first time on this day. Grey down was beginning
to replace the white natal down and crest feathers had begun to emerge.
By day 15 the chick weighed 525g and feeding times were adjusted to
three times per day: 07Q0h, 1200h, and 16Q0h. Chopped adult quail and
adult mice were introduced, and by day 22 food items alternated between
quail, mice and rats. Pellets were regurgitated almost daily, and the chick
often refused food until it had cast.
The 28-day old chick, weighing 1400g, was moved to a 1 x 1.2m
brooder box kept at room temperature (26*C). The bird had begun to
pick at any eye-catching object and was capable of eating food offered on
a saucer, which it approached by shuffling along the box floor on its hocks,
Although its first attempt to stand was made on day 33, success was not

achieved until day 51, when, balancing with outstretched wings, the bird
remained upright for a few seconds. Food offered had been decreased to
twice daily when the 60-day old chick, was moved to a large room with an
outside yard. By day 71 the bird was standing and walking well, and was
soon capable of running, leaping and making mock attacks at blowing
leaves. Reactions to live prey appeared innate, snakes being dispatched by
blows of the feet accompanied by animated leaping and agitated crest
erection.
This bird's juvenile plumage is noticeably marked with brown, as op-
posed to clear grey, a condition reported occasionally in wild juveniles and
suggested by Wennrich (1984) to be a possible indicator of female gender.
Since independence, this bird has been held in an off-exhibit 4.5 x 6m area
with inside heated shelter and access to an outside yard 7.5 x 9 m in warm
weather. It is planned to introduce the bird to an ungulate exhibit in the
spring. Present diet consists of 10 to 12 mice, six to eight day-old chicks,
or a mixture of the two items, and 115g commercial bird-of-prey diet
daily. On 15th March 1987, at adult size, the bird's weight was approxi-
mately 4.5 kg.

feel it is, nevertheless, a significant achievement, providing valuable data
and experience, and demonstrating the potential for captive husbandry
and reproduction of this unique bird. It is hoped that further success will
be achieved, both at this Zoo and elsewhere, to contribute to our under-
standing of its breeding biology, plumage changes and behavioural develop-
ment.

BREEDING THE ANTIPODES ISLAND UNICOLOR OR
GREEN PARRAKEET Cyanoramphus unicolor
AT THE WELLINGTON ZOO, NEW ZEALAND
By RON GOUDSWAARD
(Senior Bird Keeper)
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.980263" page_id="56240864"  page_num="120" year="" vol="">
The Unicolor is found naturally only on the main island of the Antipo-
des Islands, a small, uninhabited group located 730km south-east of New
Zealand. Unicolors are the largest of the Cyanoramphus parrakeets and
they are a lovely grass green colour with a slightly turquoise sheen on their
heads and necks. They share the island with Reischek's Parrakeet G novae-
zelandiae hotchstetteri , which is another closely related species, only
slightly smaller in size and which has a red forehead and eye stripe, similar
to the Red-crowned Parrakeet G ru novaezelandiae of the New Zealand
mainland.
Both the Unicolor and Reischek's Parrakeets are naturally tame and
make delightful aviary subjects. They are very trusting and like nothing
better than to fly on to your shoulder as soon as you enter the aviary, and
explore your person. The experience can be painful when you have an
aviary full of 'untrained' young birds because they delight in tweaking
your earlobes. Fortunately they do eventually learn from your erratic fly
swatting movements that nipping earlobes, and plucking hairs from the
back of your neck, are not tolerated. They are so tame, curious and con-
fident that to catch one, all you have to do is place your empty carry
cage, with its doors open, on the floor of the aviary and wait for one to
go in. The Wildlife Officers reported that they caught our original birds

with a butterfly net. The Unicolors are delightful company, cheerful,
intelligent, and talkative without being noisy, and they are very active.
Unfortunately, they are like Patagonian Conures in that their tail feathers
are soon frayed and broken from climbing up and down the wire netting.
You cannot leave a broom standing against the wall without one sidling
up to push it over and any shrub is defoliated in no time at all.
In 1969 three pairs were collected from the Antipodes Islands by the
New Zealand Wildlife Service. One bird died and was replaced in 1970.
From this group a captive population was established at Mount Bruce
Native Bird Reserve. These were then distributed among certain institu-
tions including Auckland Zoo, Wellington Zoo, and Brooklands Zoo,
New Plymouth. Wellington Zoo received its first pair of Unicolors on
29th June, 1974. However, they failed to breed successfully, the male
breaking the eggs as they were laid, and when the female died on 31st
October 1979, the male was given to Peter McKenzie, a private breeder
who was enjoying considerable success with Kakarikis (Red-crowned
and Yellow-crowned Parrakeets). Of the above institutions only Brook-
lands Zoo was successful in breeding them. The private breeders were
more successful and the captive population increased steadily.
In the winter of 1983 the Wellington Zoo was again presented with
a pair. The female arrived on the 23rd May from Mr. and Mrs. Heather-
bell, private breeders from Nelson who have a very good record for breed-
ing native parrots. The male arrived on 1st June from the Wildlife Service
Centre at Te Anau. He arrived after a spate of deaths in several institutions
due to a viral infection similar to leucosis. Consequently the male was
quarantined in the hospital until 25th June before it was deemed safe for
him to join the female. Males have a slightly larger head, a correspondingly
heavier bill, the turquoise is slightly more pronounced and our males are
decidedly bolder than our females.
The birds' natural friendliness to people extends towards each other.
When the male was introduced to the female in her aviary on 25th June
they made friends instantly. First the female led him around the aviary
with lots of talking on both sides. The vocalising is recognisably similar
to Red-crowned Parrakeet calls but seems a lot more expressive. Unfor-
tunately it is rather hard to describe. The male gradually became more
excited and they both descended to the ground at the front of the aviary,
where the male started displaying to the female. His display was different
to anything I had seen and I have seen it on only one other occasion
since then. The male ran several tight circles around the female, and as he
ran he rapidly tapped the outer curve of his bill on the ground as if knock-
ing on a door.
Then he faced her and placed the side of his head on the ground, first

one side and then the other, repeated several times in succession. They
were introduced at 9.45 a.m. When next checked, at 10.30 a.m., the male
was quietly feeding the female inside the house. But it was not until nearly
one month later, on 22nd July, that mating was seen for the first time,
which was understandable considering that it was the middle of winter.
Over the next couple of months the matings became more frequent and
on 20th September, in early spring, two nest boxes were provided. The
aviary measures 5.75m x 1.95m wide and 2.8 m high. The back is enclosed
for 1.5m and a further 1 m is roofed over. Grass sods were grown in a
raised garden on each side of a central path. The nest boxes are slightly
larger than our standard Kakariki boxes and measure 150 x 200 x 530mm
tall inside, with a 68mm diameter entry hole near the top which I hoped
would be too small for the male to enter. In the wild Unicolors are reported
to nest in burrows on the ground under tussock plants and Mr. Heatherbell
told me that his birds preferred to use a nest-box that was fitted with a
sloping entrance tunnel. 1 fitted a short tunnel to the entrance of one of
the boxes but the female used this box only as a last resort, and for an
entirely different reason which I shall outline later. The boxes were hung
on the walls, close to the ceiling under the roofed section of the aviary and
the birds, forever inquisitive, inspected them immediately although the
male was not seen to go inside one for many months. 1 should point out
that for the original pair in 1975, the boxes had been placed on the ground
and the male at the time broke any eggs as soon as they were laid.
From 29th September the female began spending more and more
time inside the boxes and on 14th October she remained inside the box
and was presumed to be sitting. The incubation period was given by Tony
Cowley of Mount Bruce as 25 to 26 days. On 4th November, I was able to
take a quick look inside the box while the female was being fed by the
male and found they had three eggs. I was careful not to upset them
because it was their first time and she had become noticeably more sec-
retive and shy since starting to breed. I noticed that she had plucked the
centre of her breast quite bare. The birds had also begun eating the grass
in the aviary, Kakapo fashion. That is, the blades of the grass had been
chewed down into little fibrous balls.
On 12th November the female was still sitting and it was becoming
obvious that she must have been sitting in the box long before any eggs
were laid, something she has done repeatedly with later clutches. It was
not until 28th November that she started to spend more time off the nest
and when the box was checked it was found to contain three dead chicks.
Two chicks were dehydrated and had obviously died a few days previously.
One chick was freshly dead but all three appeared to be less than two days
old at death and to have empty crops, which meant that the parents had

not been feeding them.
The adults seemed to lose interest in breeding and it was not until
17th January the following year that the female was seen going in and
out of the box. The next day she remained in the nest-box and was pre-
sumed to be sitting. The nest was left undisturbed until early on 15th
February when it was found to contain two chicks, of which one was
already dead. Four hours later the surviving chick still had not been fed
and it was removed with the two remaining eggs to an incubator for hand-
rearing. The subsequent hand-rearing will be described in a separate article.
In early April the hand-reared chick was placed in an aviary near the
parents which seemed to distract the female from incubating her next
clutch. However, at the end of April she proceeded to lay yet another
clutch and the first of these hatched on 16th May 1984. With some idea
now of the food requirements, learned from the hand-rearing experience,
the Unicolors were provided with sweet corn (maize) and wholemeal
bread in addition to the fruit, carrot, sow thistle Sonchus oleraceus,
silver beet, sunflower seed mix and honey water they had already been
receiving. We had been warned in 1975 by Mr. Cowley that the cause of
death in our original female could be due to the rich acidic foods we had
been providing at the time. Unicolors are primarily foliage feeders and he
claimed that peanuts were too rich and exotic fruits such as tamarillo,
kiwifruit and oranges were too acidic. Since then we have fed mainly
apple, pear and banana. It was Mr. Heatherbell who warned us that Uni-
colors consume tremendous amounts of green food when rearing chicks
and recommended that we supply large quantities of silverbeet, several
times a day if necessary, honey water, carrots and carrot tops.
The extra foods paid off because when I went back, expecting to have
to feed the chick, I found the parents had already fed it! A second chick,
hatched the following day, was also reared although a third chick hatched
on the 4th survived only a couple of days.
On 12th June it was interesting to see that the chicks had the same
white spot on the back of the head as did the hand-reared chick, 'Stirling',
at that age. These two also had a white spot on each elbow of the wings -
presumably so that the parents can see them in the gloom of a burrow.
The first fledged on 4th July and the second on 6th July. The male became
extremely vocal as if advertising his prowess. He was no longer interested
in landing on our shoulders and directed his attention to the parrots in the
neighbouring aviary - becoming much more aggressive towards them.
Within two days the adults were seen mating again and the female was
reported sitting the following day (9th July) this time in the box with the
tunnel entrance. On 7th August, when she came off to feed, the box was
found to contain six eggs. Unfortunately this success was short-lived.

When checked on 14th August the nest was found to contain four chicks -
all dead - and two eggs. The fifth hatched on 17th and had food in the
crop but was found dead on the 19th. The last egg failed to hatch and the
boxes were removed for cleaning on 23rd August. The diet had been the
same as for the previous chick except for dandelion leaves included with
the sow thistle and the absence of fresh corn as it was now out of season.
The same two nest boxes were returned on 18th October 1984 and al-
though they were quite excited, they did not start to lay until December.
The first two eggs were laid in the tunnel box and they obviously had
reservations about both boxes. The first box had been considerably chewed
up to line the nest for the first two chicks and the parents were obviously
unhappy about the second box as they had deserted the eggs by 20th
December. The female went back to the first box but no eggs were laid
until after a new box, undamaged and of the same material as the first
box, was placed in the aviary on 14th March 1985. Even then it was not
until May that the female was back on the nest and by the 25th the male
had become his usual friendly self. On 10th June Peter McKenzie told us
that he provided softbill rearing food and germinated seed for his Kararikis
and this tip provided the breakthrough that we needed. We began supply-
ing &amp;apos;Greens Conditioning Food 5 on the 14th and since then we have not
looked back. The chicks were first heard on 2nd July. By the 19th there
were five chicks and all five were reared to independence. A few weeks
after the chicks fledged in August the female was again sitting and hatched
another four chicks in October and again four were reared.
In the 1985/86 season the birds were given the same three boxes, duly
repaired, and again the tunnel box was ignored, at least until the other two
boxes had been destroyed. Because they consume such prodigious amounts
of green food, the chicks produce an equally prodigious amount of faeces,
and the female goes to considerable length to strip slivers of wood off the
inside of the box to continually reline the nest as it becomes fouled. By
the time a brood has fledged there may be holes in the woodwork and the
entrance has been considerably enlarged. In each season the most popular
boxes were those made of soft, untreated pine. The box fitted with the
tunnel was of harder wood and when they were forced to use this box for
the third clutch of the season they were unable to strip it and I had to pro-
vide handfuls of shavings in the nest at regular intervals. Fortunately, by
this time the parents were becoming old hands at breeding and were a lot
more tolerant of my interference. The male would sit near me watching
while I hauled out Ms chicks, one by one, cleaned out the nest, put in a
new layer of clean shavings and then put the chicks back in. However,
rebuilding three or four nest-boxes at the end of each season was becoming
a chore. Our carpenter hit on the idea of screwing easily removable soft-

wood battens on the inside of each box. The battens are easily replaced at
the end of each season.
Another lesson was learned with the establishment of our second pair.
A wild-caught female was received on 27th March 1985 as a mate for our
hand-reared male. They were introduced on 4th April and at first he drove
her all round the aviary without actually coming to blows.
At the end of April they were given a nest-box and although the female
was interested there was no sign of pairing up. We were afraid that maybe
the male was too imprinted, certainly he was far more familiar with us
than his parents ever were. Then, on 20th May, while I was cleaning their
aviary, I noticed a change in their relationship. Instead of bickering and
chasing each other they kept up a continuous contact 'talking'. As soon as
I continued on to the next aviary, 'Stirling' went down to the female on
the ground and began displaying to her, head down, making a deep char-
ring noise while running circles around her, followed by feeding her twice.
In June they were given a second box, hung high near the ceiling as usual
but it was not until the following season, when the nest-boxes were
lowered to the ground for a couple of weeks while the aviaries were
sprayed for mites, that the female suddenly started laying in one of them.
The box was left on the ground and they have been breeding in it ever
since.
Although they would breed right through the winter, we now remove
the boxes after they have reared two clutches.
If these delightful birds have one drawback as aviary subjects, it is that
they are hopelessly accident prone. They do not have a clue how to look
after themselves. They run under your feet as you move around the aviary;
yes, one of our young birds has been stood on and had to be put down.
Several young birds have managed to get themselves caught up by their leg
bands resulting in sprains and in one case a broken leg. Another trick of
theirs is to poke their heads out through the doorway just as you are clos-
ing the door; yes, one was caught. It is hard to watch simultaneously the
ground at your feet, all four edges of the door, the buckets of feed you are
carrying, and the birds, to make sure none escapes. That particular bird
did actually recover although he had trouble holding his head up for a
while! Even rotten logs placed in the aviary for them to chew proved a
hazard. One male tunnelled underneath, became stuck and died before his
plight could be noticed. They also like bathing and any water receptacle
would have to be reasonably shallow. They are prone to infections carried
by other birds. In 1983 a large proportion of the captive population in
New Zealand was wiped out by avian .leucosis. Unicolors should not be
housed near Kakarikis which are carriers of this disease.

There seem to be several factors involved for successful breeding of the
Unicolor Parrakeets in captivity and at present we are one of the few insti-
tutions currently doing so - hence the need for this article.
Although the birds are naturally tame, they are secretive in their nest-
ing habits and require at least two, preferably three nest-boxes. Our original
male always makes a show of waiting outside the wrong box so that we
cannot tell which box is in use. Our hand-reared male is not so particular
in this respect - he treats us more as rivals than as a threat. I believe the
lack of nest-site security, i.e. being unable to keep the nest-site secret, is
the greatest cause of failure in other institutions. They continue to exper-
ience, as we did with our first pair in 1975, males going in to destroy the
eggs as soon as they are laid.
The wild-caught female seemed more concerned with location. The
captive-bred female was quite content to use nest-boxes hung near the
ceiling whereas the wild-caught female appeared to wait until a box had
been placed on the ground, which would be more similar to the con-
ditions she would have experienced in the wild.
The nest-boxes should be of soft untreated wood with a small entry
hole. Battens screwed inside the boxes provide a simple alternative. I
line the boxes with potting mix as used for pot plants, but without the

fertiliser, and dampened down with water at the beginning of the
season.
The birds require copious amounts of food when rearing young - par-
ticularly green food such as sow thistle or silver beet. We provide fresh
food several times a day to encourage the male to keep feeding the chicks.
We have found conditioning/rearing food indispensable, even though the
adults seem to use it only for the first two weeks after hatching. For the
latter part of rearing the green food consumption is matched by the con-
sumption of sunflower seed. Brown bread soaked in honey water, raw
carrot and fresh corn are the other three most popular items. They take
very little of the germinated seeds or even seeding grasses.

I would like to thank all the staff involved directly or indirectly with looking
after the Unicolor Parrakeets. Their feed requirements are demanding, particularly
the collecting of fresh green food, and they make a lot of mess afterwards. I am in-
debted to Peter McKenzie and Mr. and Mrs. Heatherbell for sharing with me their
hard won knowledge, and to Barbara Blanchard and Kerry Muller for correcting my

The Violet Touraco, also known as the Violet or Violaceous Plantain-
eater, is one of the larger members of the family Musophagidae. There are
18 to 22 species in this family, all of which are native to Africa, south of
the Sahara. The Violet Touraco is found in evergreen forests fringing the
banks of streams (the 'gallery' forests) in western Africa. Its range extends
from Gambia to Sierra Leone, Dahomey, Nigeria and northern Cameroon,
and probably also Senegal. This range overlaps with the very similar Lady
Ross's Touraco M. rossae only found in Cameroon. Little is known of the
natural history of either species, though in the wild the Violet Touraco is
most often seen in pairs and is reported to feed principally on the fruits
and seeds of Ficus and other trees.
There is a beautiful colour plate of this species, painted by Roland
Green, accompanied by a short note by David Seth-Smith, in the Avicul-
turalMagazine for June, 1930, p. 141-2.
Like other touracos, the Violet Touraco possesses semi-zygodactylous
feet, that is to say that the fourth toe can be positioned either forward or
backwards. The inherent manoeuvrability of the outer toe allows the birds
to run along branches of trees as actively as a squirrel, using their tails as
rudders to maintain balance. Short, swooping flights clear gaps too large to
be hopped over, and reveal the bright crimson patches on the flight feathers
that are typical of many touraco species. The majority of the plumage is a
shining violet blue, with the hind crown bearing fur-like, dark crimson
feathers.
Nests of the Violet Touraco have been found 6-7.5m (20 to 25 feet)
from the ground and consist of fragile stick platforms so transparent and
flimsy that the two greyish-white eggs can be observed through the bottom.
The eggs are almost perfectly round [42 x 36mm (1.65in x 1.42in) accord-
ing to Mackworth-Praed; one of our eggs measured 36.25 x 35.40mm
(1.43in x 1.39in)] and are about the size and texture of ping-pong balls.
Nests have been found in April in Gambia and in June in Nigeria. No men-
tion could be found in the literature of the incubation period, nor a des-
cription of nestlings or fledglings.
In December 1981, Brookfield Zoo received four Violet Touracos.
When the birds were surgically sexed, it was discovered that one was a male

and the remaining three were females. It was decided to place a pair in the
large 28m x 10m x 15m high (92 x 34 x 50 ft), mixed species, indoor
flight cage at the Aquatic Bird House for breeding purposes, and to place
the two remaining females in Tropic World/Africa. Tropic World, opened
in 1982, was designed to exhibit representatives of forest-dwelling pri-
mates, other mammals, and birds, in settings that give the viewer the feeling
of having stepped into the tropical rain forests of South America, Asia and
Africa. Tropic World is the largest indoor zoo exhibit in the world. The
Africa section alone is 33.5m x 58m x 23m high (110 x 190 x 75ft) and
contains a family of gorillas, four species of monkeys, a pygmy hippopo-
tamus, and varying numbers of bird species (currently Black-headed
Orioles, a Bristleball, African Spoonbills, Lilac-breasted Rollers, Jackson's
Hornbills and Hadada Ibis, along with the Violet Touracos ).
In March 1983, one of the female Touracos in Tropic World/Africa was
found dead. As touracos had done very well in this large exhibit, and since
the pair of birds at the Aquatic Bird House had never shown any courtship
behaviour or interest in breeding, it was decided to move the pair into
Tropic World/Africa and the single female into the Aquatic Bird House.
This was accomplished in December 1983.
It was originally thought that the extra space provided by the enormous
size of the Tropic World/Africa exhibit would provide the needed stimulus
to induce the Violet Touracos to breed. In retrospect, it appears that Tropic
World/Africa is also an excellent replica of the gallery forests where these
birds are found in the wild, and that we could not have designed a better
breeding site. It did not take long for the pair of Touracos to feel at home;
courtship feeding of the female by the male, chasing of the female, and
unison calling were all observed during their first month of residence.
An egg was found broken on the public walkway of the exhibit in
April 1984, and then things began to get moving. In May, the pair was
seen carrying nesting material (twigs of Ficus broken from the exhibit
trees) to the north wall of the exhibit above the public walkway. This
wall consists of artificial rockwork with built-in planters full of live and
artificial plants and extends to approximately 6m (20ft) above the public
walkway. Between the top of this wall and the ceiling of the exhibit is
approximately lm (2-3ft) of wire hardware cloth, permitting ventilation
and lighting of the exhibit without allowing the birds to escape. The
hardware cloth is hidden behind a screening of plastic plants and natural
branches.
By the middle of May, only the male was observed during the morning
inventory of the exhibit birds - the female had apparently begun incuba-
tion. A few days later, the female was observed out in the exhibit in the

evenings when the male would disappear (presumably to relieve his mate

On 15th June, both birds were seen out in the exhibit for the first
time since the incubation began, calling and beaking (a behaviour pattern
in which the birds rub and rattle their beaks together - it is thought to
strengthen the pair bond). The male was also observed searching through
the planters. We assumed that the eggs had hatched, and that the birds
were searching for crickets (which are thrown out into the exhibit daily)
or other live food to feed their young. An extra pan of the birds' staple
diet, consisting of Brookfield Zoo's prepared frugivore diet (diet formula-
tion available on request), dry dog food, and liberal amounts of chopped
lettuce, was provided. Extra crickets were also thrown into the planters
daily. Other species of touraco are known to regurgitate food for their
young, and this species was assumed to be no exception.
There is a catwalk behind the north wall of Tropic World/Africa that
is used by maintenance personnel as access to the exhibit lights, air hand-
lers and other equipment. This catwalk also became a convenient observa-
tion point when the flimsy twig nest containing two charcoal grey, downy
young was discovered a few days after the presumed hatch date. The
female was very defensive of her young, so the keeper only observed the
nest for a short period. The young were seen to be fat and healthy.
At this point, a decision had to be made regarding the future manage-
ment of the chicks. It is, of course, always preferable to allow the parent
birds to rear their own young. However, allowing the chicks to fledge from
the nest into an exhibit where the nearest floor is 6m down and made of
concrete is not particularly safe. Though touraco chicks usually climb
around on branches for several days before they begin to fly, it was felt
that these should be removed for hand-rearing before that time. Other
species of touraco that have been bred in captivity have left the nest as
early as 15 days after hatching (Grey Touraco Corythaixoid.es concolor
at the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust). We wanted to leave the chicks
with their parents as long as possible, so we decided to pull the chicks
from the nest at 14 days old. This was accomplished with an extension
ladder, a bucket on a rope, and the need for extra hands to fend off the
attacks of the female.
The chicks were put in an incubator set at 33*C (85*F). They were
placed together in a food crock lined with paper towels with straw on
the top for their feet to grasp. After the first day bits of what appeared
to be straw appeared in the defecation of one of the chicks so the bedding
was changed to short twigs.
The hand-rearing diet we used was basically the same frugivorous diet
offered to the adults, with the addition of chopped, new-born mice. The

chicks were easily taught to be hand-fed on the first day, as they would
threat gape and lunge at the keeper whenever approached, making it easy
to pop food into their open mouths. After the first few feedings they
readily begged when the incubator door was opened. The chicks were
fed every hour for the first two days, every hour and a half for the next
three days, then every two hours until they were eating on their own. The
chicks began to pick up food from the pan at approximately 19 days old,
and were eating totally on their own by 25-26 days old.
Because of the problem of imprinting on keepers, reported in Red-
crested Touracos at Riverbanks Zoological Park, South Carolina (Robert
Seibels, pers. comm.), a puppet was made from a stuffed navy blue sweat-
shirt sleeve with a Violet Touraco face painted on it. Though they were
not fed with the puppet, it was present with the chicks at all times. They
seemed to more or less ignore it, often perching on it. However, neither
these two chicks nor any of our subsequent chicks imprinted on their
keepers so we felt the puppet was a good precaution.
In the space of seven months in 1984-85, we reared six more Violet
Touraco chicks, using the methods outlined above. Of the eight chicks
reared, six came from two-egg clutches and two came from one-egg clutches.
No differences in weight gain, development, or degree of tameness were
noted between chicks reared singly and chicks reared together.
After the last chick (a singleton) was pulled for hand-rearing in March
1985, the pair became erratic in their nest attempts. An egg was laid in one
of the old nests (the pair alternated between two nests for all their breed-
ing), but was found out of the nest a few days later. During this period,
the male was alternately aggressive and attentive to his mate, culminating
in a bout of intensive chasing, lasting for several days. The female spent
most of her time hiding, since whenever she came out to eat or bathe the
male would pounce on her. At this point we decided to remove the birds
from Tropic World/Africa in order to rest the female. The birds were
easily trapped using grapes for bait and moved to an off-exhibit breeding
facility. One of their male offspring took their place in the exhibit, where
he was later joined by our extra wild-caught female.
At the time of writing, our original parent birds are housed back in the :
large flight cage in the Aquatic Bird House. They have demonstrated all
of the normal courtship behaviour and have laid one clutch of eggs, which
unfortunately turned out to be infertile. They are currently (February
1988) sitting on their second clutch. The young hand-reared male in Tropic
World/Africa has been unlucky. Though he has courted and subsequently
pair-bonded with two wild-caught females, both came to untimely ends
just as nest-building commenced. We are now looking for another female
for our healthy young male, and hoping for more success from his parents.

(July 1988) Sin.ce the above was completed, our original parent birds in the
Aquatic Bird House have fledged their second and third clutches. The third is ex-
tremely interesting, as it consisted of three healthy chicks, all of whom fledged
successfully. This is, to my knowledge, the first time a touraco species has reared
a clutch of three. We were also able to obtain a captive-bred female from the Hous-
ton (Texas) Zoological Garden for our young male in Tropic World-Africa. This pair
has built a nest and appears totally compatible, but as yet has laid no eggs.

BREEDING THE COLLARED SUNBIRD
Anthreptes coHaris

This small sunbird is found in moist forest and thick bush along the
entire coastal belt of the eastern half of southern Africa, as well as in
the north-eastern regions.
It measures about 10 cm long and has a relatively straight, shortish
bill. Both sexes are metallic green above, underparts are yellow but the
male has a green throat with a narrow, purple chest band.
Collared Sunbirds are insectivorous and usually seen in pairs, creeping
in flowering trees or creepers, looking for insects.
In 1985 I purchased a pair of Collared Sunbirds and put them at the
end of my birdroom in a planted aviary which measured 9 x 4 ft (2.74 x
1.22 m) with an outside flight 9 x 5 ft (2.74 x 1.52 m).
The diet which I fed to them was a mixture consisting of two scoops
of Wysoy, four teaspoons of white sugar, one heaped quarter-teaspoon of
pollen, one one-eighth teaspoon yeast, four drops of Minamino to one
pint of water; also simulated nectar mix with sponge cage, skinned grapes,
chopped up small, and small mealworms.
In the spring of 1986, the hen started to carry bits of grass about and
tried to build a nest in a hanging basket, which was planted with Impatiens.
After a week, she gave up trying and built a nest on the earth of the basket.
Two eggs were laid; these hatched on the 14th day but were thrown
out. I replaced them in the nest but the same thing happened again.
I was told that it was the cock that was the culprit, and on the next
occasion she laid two eggs, I removed the cock and left the hen to incubate.
These eggs hatched, and she fed the young on spiders and small mealworms.
I had plenty of fruit flies and cricket hatchlings, but she would not look
at them. After five days the weather turned dull and wet and I was unable
to collect enough spiders and the two chicks died.
After five days I placed the cock back again and they mated. I had to
remove him on this occasion as he was being attacked by the hen. One
young was hatched but died at 10 days old, as it was getting late in the
year and I could not collect a sufficient number of spiders. It was winter
now so I hoped that I would have better luck in the coming spring. During
the winter I tried a number of times to put the cock back, but each time
he was attacked by the hen, and blood was drawn. All through the winter
I had to keep them apart.

In the spring of 1987 the bird(R) were calling to each other. The hen
started to carry grass about and tried to build a nest in some dead branches
but the grass kept on falling down. I made a nest which I fixed between
the branches and she then lined it with hair and feathers. I let the cock in
for about 10 minutes but had to take him away after mating. I did this for
three days to make sure that she had been mated.
Two eggs were laid but when I entered the birdroom on the morning
of the seventh day of incubation, I found that the hen was not sitting.
On checking the flights I found that I had shut her out in the outside
flight all night. I let her in and she went straight to the nectar and drank at
least half of a tube and then went back to sit on the eggs. I did not hold
out much hope that the chicks would hatch but to my surprise, they did
so on the 15th day but only lived for two days. After about five days,
the hen started to call the cock again, so I placed him in with the hen for
ten-minute periods for the next three days.
On 1st June two eggs were laid and chicks hatched on 14th June. I
started to collect spiders, but again there were very few about and I must
thank my friend Geoff Wragg, who came out spider hunting with me every
night.
We travelled miles looking for gorse bushes and tapping them to dis-
lodge the spiders into a plastic icecream carton. One young died at seven
days due to lack of live food.
We had to find a way to get more spiders and came up with an idea
of a hoop made of half-inch flat iron with two handles.
The hoop was covered with plastic with a dip in the centre. I held the
device under the bushes whilst Geoff tapped them with a tennis racket.
On the first night we got about 100 spiders.
The weather was now getting warmer, and we managed to find a spot
quite near - a side road off a main trunk road, with an abundance of
bushes along both sides. To our surprise we were collecting around 500
spiders each night. The chick was growing fast, and I contacted a firm
which breed live food and they were able to supply me with wax moth
larvae, some of which were about an inch long (0.02m). The hen would
beat these against a perch and then feed them to the chick; I gave her
six in the evening so that I was satisfied that the chick had been well fed
for the night.
On 28th June, the chick left the nest and did not return, preferring
to sleep on a perch beside its mother.
My wife was watching the chick exploring the outside flight, and to
her surprise saw a hen Copper Sunbird in the next flight feed the chick
through the wire netting. About 11 days later it was feeding itself on
nectar, and we were able to take a night off from, spider hunting.

Despite all the time and patience required, it was well worth the
trouble as I believe that this is the first breeding of this species in Britain.
On 1st September, the hen was calling again and so I placed the cock in
with her. On the 7th she was sitting on two eggs and we were out spider-
hunting again.
One chick hatched on 24th September, three days overdue, possibly
because the weather was colder. We collected a good number of spiders.
The second chick hatched on 27th September but died the next day. We
continued collecting spiders whenever the weather permitted.
By 9th October the chick was standing on the side of the nest, flapping
its wings, and the hen was feeding it on wax moth larvae and white meal-
worms, plus whatever spiders we could catch.
By 11th October the chick was ready to leave the nest and the hen was
trying to entice it to fly by holding a larvae near it, then moving away. The
weather was fme so we went out spider-hunting and collected around 300
which 1 put in the outside flight. The hen made a lot of noise and I
thought she was calling to the chick to leave the nest so I did not go into
the birdroom until the evening when I went there to feed the birds. 1 knew
that something was amiss because all the birds were restless and on check-
ing I found that the young sunbird was not in the nest. Looking round the
flight I found that it was dead and hanging down behind the nest, its foot
entwined in some fine grass. I concluded that it had tried to fly to a
branch and was stopped in mid-air because the other end of the grass was
woven into the inside of the nest and it then fell down behind the nest. I
was devastated after the chick had got so far and then was to die like this.
I shall hope to have success again in 1988; I think the first chick is a
cock but I am not sure and would be much obliged to anyone who may
have a suitable mate for it.
As described above, the Collared Sunbird Anthreptes collaris was bred
by Mr. A. Ridd in 1987 and this is believed to be the first success in this country.
Anyone knowing of a previous breeding in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, or of
any other reason that would disqualify this claim, is asked to contact the Hon.
Secretary.

HAND-REARING A PURPLE-BELLIED PARROT
Triclaria malachitacea
By ROSEMARY LOW
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996926666666667" page_id="56240883"  page_num="139" year="" vol="">
(Curator of Birds, Loro Parque, Tenerife)
The single member of the genus Triclaria is a most distinctive neo-
tropical parrot. The specific name malachitacea must refer to the rich,
glossy dark green of the plumage, for the dictionary definition of mala-
chite is a green mineral taking a high polish. Both sexes have iridescent
sky blue under the wings and the tail tipped with sky blue. Sexual di-
morphism is marked, the male having the abdomen and part of the lower
breast violet, these areas being green in the female. Sex is apparent in
nestlings.
The Purple-bellied Parrot is unique in appearance, behaviour and
voice. The latter is exceptional. The male has a melodious, thrush-like
song; the female renders a more subdued warbling. Not only does the
male have a song which is a joy to listen to, but in my opinion few parrots
are more pleasing in appearance and personality.
After keeping parrots for 30 years, inevitably a few birds etch them-
selves indelibly on one's memory. One of these was a male Purple-bellied
Parrot which gave me enormous pleasure during ten years in my aviaries.
This species is very rare in aviculture for several reasons: it is endemic
to Brazil; it is difficult to establish in captivity; and it is not likely to
attract the attention of trappers, whose demand is mainly for Amazon
parrots and macaws. It may be the only parrot endemic to south-
eastern Brazil which is not endangered - yet. A forest bird, its strong-
hold is the lower montane forest of the Sierra del Mar which is too steep
and too wet for agricultural use.
I believe that captive breeding has occurred in only two or three col-
lections, including Loro Parque. At the beginning of 1988 two pairs
nested here. Both females laid clutches of four eggs. One clutch (first
egg - 20th January) was infertile; the other (first egg - 7th January) was
fertile. Two eggs were removed to the incubator when pipping commenced.
The first chick hatched on 6th February (weight 6.2g), the second hatched
in the nest and the third hatched on 11th February in the incubator
(6.7g). One was returned to the nest immediately and the other after
three days. The unhatched egg measured 22 x 27mm.
The three young were very well cared for, thus it was totally unexpec-
ted to find one dead in the nest on 29th February; the cause of death
could not be ascertained. The two surviving chicks were then taken to the

hand-rearing room. A very distressing event followed a few minutes later: one
of the chicks died of shock. (On autopsy it was found to be a male.) In 15
months there have been three cases of chicks dying within minutes of being
removed from the nest - something which I had never previously experienced.
The surviving chick proved easy to rear. The food, fed by spoon, consisted
of Nestle's baby cereals, wheat germ cereal, sunflower seed kernels, papaya or
apple, carrot and calcium and mineral additives.
As the young Triclaria grew, its independent nature became apparent.
Never did it show any affection towards those who fed it. It would solicit
feeding with head-bobbing movements and a rapid chack-chack-chack-chack,
not unlike the rarely heard alarm call of an adult. It was easy to handle until
the weaning stage when it disliked being held, although never did it bite. It
also seemed to dislike being caged. It was moved from brooder to cage at 45
days and was perching two days later.
By 12th March (33 days) I could be certain of its sex - a female! This was

good news as we had an unpaired male; females of this species are even harder
to obtain than males. At this stage all the feathers of the underparts had
errupted - and all were green; I had watched anxiously for any sign of violet!
During the weaning period she took corn-on-the-cob almost to the exclu-
sion of other foods. She weaned quickly and left the hand-rearing room on
3rd May, aged 84 days. She continued to receive fresh corn for some weeks
and remained caged indoors for another 10 days.
Then, at the early age of 13 weeks, she was placed with the male, after
one of his wings was clipped. In the event, this precaution was unnecessary.
From her behaviour towards those she knew, I guessed that she would soon
assert her authority with the male, and this proved to be the case.
The pair were housed in a suspended cage in the new (second) breeding
centre and, in spite of her tender age, she soon settled down. But she would
still give food-soliciting movements at the sight of her favourite corn-on-the-
cob (maize).
The accompanying table shows her weights during the rearing period. It
is of interest that the weight at weaning, about 120g (80 days) was first
gained at the age of 41 days.

Long-tailed Glossy Starlings are widely distributed in the savannah belt
of sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal east to the Sudan. Two similar species
of more restricted distribution are Ruppell's Starling Lamprotornis pur-
poropterns found in East Africa and Meve's Starling Lamprotornis mevesii
of southern Africa. Long-tailed Glossy Starlings are distinguished by
having velvety black spots on their wing coverts and scapulars and also
have longer tails than their close relatives.
I have been fortunate in being able to study Long-tailed Glossy Star-
lings in the wild and in captivity. Field observations were made whilst
resident in Nigeria between September 1977 and July 1983, and again on a
brief visit in February 1987. Studies of captive birds were made at Chester
Zoo over the period September 1983 to the present but most relate to
observations at one nest in October and December 1987.
Long-tailed Glossy Starlings have been imported frequently into the
United Kingdom but surprisingly previous captive breedings do not appear
to have been reported here for L. caudatus , although they have for both
L. mevesii and L. purpur op terns (Coles, 1986).
History at Chester Zoo
Chester Zoo records indicate that Long-tailed Glossy Starlings have
been held without interruption since 1974. The first breeding success
appears to have been in autumn 1979. No further breeding attempts
occurred and in June 1984 the present breeding female was purchased.
The deaths of two of the original stock preceded the next breeding at-
tempt in 1985 when a chick was fledged on 13th November. This bird
was not reared to maturity and a further death in 1986 reduced the stock
to two birds; a male obtained in 1978 and the female purchased in 1984.
This pair of birds successfully fledged a chick on 21st May 1986 which
remained with its parents in the free-flight of the Tropical House. In May
1987 this young bird, now a year old, was observed along with its parents
carrying food into the nest-box. The first chick fledged from this nest on
28th May and by 1st June two more chicks had fledged. Two of these
were lost into water areas within the Tropical House but the third was

successfully reared. This latter bird had a few pale feathers which, at the
age of six months, still served to distinguish it from the 1986 young.
In October 1987 the breeding pair nested again and two chicks fledged on
14th and 15th November. Both immatures (the one bred in 1986, and that
hatched in May 1987) remained with the parents and both were seen to
feed this last brood both in the nest and after fledging. Two chicks fledged
succsssfully but the 1986 hatched subadult disappeared without trace in
late December 1987.
Food and feeding
Long-tailed Glossy Starlings forage mainly on the ground but also in
trees taking a variety of insects and fruit as available. At Kano, Nigeria,
food items noted included the ripe fruits of the introduced neem tree
Azadarichtica indica and the large terrestrial ants Mesor galla.
In captivity the birds thrive on a standard softbill diet, which at Chester
Zoo comprises minced meat, grated hard-boiled egg, carrot and biscuit
meal blended with proprietary brands of insectivorous mixture plus
chopped fruit and live locusts and mealworms. Insects are particularly
important when small young are in the nest for in captivity these are
then fed almost exclusively on live food.
Moult ; Weights , etc.
Biometric data obtained from a number of birds captured at Kano
are given in Table 1. Most of the birds were caught using locally crafted
leg snares at favoured feeding locations, especially those where ants were
actively foraging. No snares were left unattended and as soon as a bird was
caught it was released from the snare, weighed, measured and inspected
for moult. Coloured celluloid leg bands were used so that each bird caught
could subsequently be individually identified and the bird released in the
area where it was caught.
There is a considerable range in size measured both as weight and wing
length. Bannerman (1953) notes that males generally exceed females with
respect to both wing and tail lengths and records little overlap between the
sexes; males having wing lengths of 170-201mm (cf females of 160-172mm)
and tail length of 260-360mm (cf females of 205-275mm). Mackworth-
Praed and Grant (1973) give a wider range for wing lengths of 151 -203mm
but do not distinguish between the sexes.
All ten birds caught at Kano had wing lengths equal to or greater than
174 mm but I suspect this reflects the shrinkage of museum skins rather
than indicating that all were males. The five birds with wing lengths
between 198-202mm are clearly all adult males. The five between 175-
194mm might include females and subadult males. One bird (Y + DB) re-

trapped after 15 months had increased its wing length from 186 to 194mm.
Some birds were clearly distinguishable as to sex in the field. In one
group of birds my field notes recall one very large male with a purple gloss
being seen next to a much smaller, slighter-headed green glossed female.
Bannerman (1953) remarks on 'a curious variety of this bird in which the
mantle, breast and wings are bright blue with purple reflections instead of
being only green as in normally coloured examples."
One bird caught in March had recently begun primary wing moult, one
in early June was half-way through primary moult and another in June was
completing replacement of its secondaries. Although one bird caught in
early September was not moulting, another caught in late October was
renewing secondaries and tail feathers. One of three starlings caught in
November showed symmetrical replacement of one of its Inner second-
aries. Several birds watched on 5th March 1981 were moulting tail fea-
thers. Probably the moult season extends over March to October but is
not fully synchronised within the population; one bird caught in July
showed no evidence of moult.
Captive birds were not systematically examined for moult but one bird
purchased on 8th June was then halfway through its primary moult, and
the breeding male underwent a pronounced head moult whilst still feeding

William Serle (1943) studied Long-tailed Glossy Starlings in northern
Nigeria where he noted that although gregarious in the dry season with
flocks of a dozen or so, they were encountered more often singly or in
pairs in July and August. However, where there were groups of baobab
trees, in which they nested, many pairs could be found in close proximity,
eggs being laid in September and October (Bannerman, 1953).
At Kano the rains usually start in April or May peaking in July and
August and finishing in September and October. My observations indicated
that small flocks of four to seven birds were most frequent in the dry season
but that all larger groups were found in June and especially July when
flocks of over 20 birds were encountered. Singletons and smaller parties
were most frequent in October, when the birds would be expected to be
incubating eggs.
Long-tailed Glossy Starlings were recorded in all months on the study
area of the Bayero University campus at Kano. Observation of colour-
banded birds suggested that these lived in stable groups that maintained
their own group territories with at least three such groups having adjacent
territories on the study area.
Aggressive behaviour and displays
Large flocks of Long-tailed Starlings were most frequently seen in July
when calling, display and chasing made these birds most conspicuous. I
suspect that this chasing was related to boundary disputes between neigh-
bouring flocks but too few birds were colour-banded to confirm these sus-
picions.
The most serious aggressive behaviour I witnessed in the wild was on
6th October 1981 when I found two birds literally locked together in com-
bat on the ground below a suspected nest tree. One bird was on its back
with its feet in the air, the other one on top of it with its legs locked to
those of its combatant. The birds remained on the ground both raising
their heads and calling for a full five minutes until I approached to within
two feet of them. The birds then separated only to immediately re-engage
in fighting, like two fighting cockerels, with their wings and tails spread
and their legs outstretched towards each other. Flying at each other and
grasping each other's legs they again fell to the ground to remain locked
together once again. Both birds were unbanded but both large and I sus-
pect males. A third bird, GRG, smaller than either of the contestants and
almost certainly a female, watched the sparring partners then flew off,
followed by both antagonists. GRG had a week previously been seen

showing interest in a possible nest-hole in this Parkia tree and was subse-
quently observed peering into the suspected nest-hole but nesting was not
confirmed.
Observations of captive birds indicated a dominance hierarchy within
the flock with the breeding pair dominant over non-breeding birds, and the
youngest recruit being at the bottom of the pecking order. At the feeding
station this was perfectly linear with the adult male dominant over the
female, both dominant over the immatures and the older immature domin-
ant over the youngest. However, the female was dominant over the male
as well as both immatures at or close to the nest-box when chicks were
present, and also in the vicinity of the fledglings.
Displays given by the captive birds included an open-bill threat display
given by the breeding female to the oldest immature shortly after the
chicks hatched and an open-bill begging display given by the female when
soliciting food from the oldest immature near the nest-site. A frequent
display involved the dropping and drooping of both wings. This was given
by the male when approached by the more dominant female and may indi-
cate a submissive posture. A similar display was given by birds attempting
to entice fledglings into cover but this was then accompanied by a shiver-
ing of the wing and tail feathers.
The adult female and oldest immature were both seen to elicit begging
from recent fledglings by pecking at their bills and crops. The adult female
attempted to obtain food from the adult male by pecking at his bill.
Vocal behaviour
Long-tailed Glossy Starlings are extremely vocal. Bannerman (1953)
notes that their calls are many and varied. Mackworth-Praed and Grant
(1973) describe them as noisy birds with unpleasant raucous screeching
cries and continual chattering in flight.
In northern Nigeria they are known in Hausa by a name pronounced
&amp;apos; elekel&amp; which is onomatopoeic for their most commonly heard call, the
sing-song quality of which is not unpleasant at a distance. Other calls
included a hoarse coughing chuochu-chu heard together with tlekele calls
from a chattering group otherwise resting in a grove of trees, and loud
raucous alarm calls. In captivity loud calling accompanied mobbing of
anybody approaching their fledglings too closely and calls were also given
in flight when driving other bird species away from the nest area.
Breeding seasons
Elgood (1982) notes that for such a numerous and conspicuous bird,
breeding is surprisingly little recorded. In six years in Kano I was unable
to confirm breeding at any of several suspected nest-sites. Most published

accounts of the nesting of Long-tailed Glossy Starlings in the wild appear
to derive from the observations of William Serle who noted that at Kano
eggs were laid in September or October; that is at the end of the wet
season. Mackworth-Praed and Grant (1973) record that in Darfur, Long-
tailed Glossy Starlings breed from August to October.
At Chester Zoo three breeding attempts were initiated in October,
that is at the season when these birds would be expected to be breeding
in the wild, but perhaps because of the seasonally unrestricted food
supply two successful breedings also occurred in May. This recalls the
biannual breeding shown by the Chestnut-bellied Starling at Kano (Wil-
kinson, 1983) and suggests that the restrictions of the breeding season
in the wild may be dictated by environmental factors imposed on an
internal rhythm.
Incubation , nestling and fledgling periods
Direct inspection of the nests was not possible because of their inac-
cessibility and the incubation period was not determined. Casual obser-
vations suggested that incubation was only by the female. The nestling
periods were calculated as 17 days for the nest in May 1987 and 21-22
days for the nest in November 1987. Fledglings remained hidden for the
first few days after leaving the nest and did not begin to feed themselves
until approximately two weeks later. They were still being fed occasionally,
particularly by the female, some three weeks after leaving the nest.
Nestlings , fledglings and juveniles
Nestlings seen by Serle (1943) were naked at a few days old, except for
a tiny patch of down over the mid-vertebral region and another patch over
the scapulars. Two immature birds observed in a flock at Kano in March
1981 were distinguished by their dull yellow eyes, and the lack of gloss on
their chests or the dark heads of the adults.
Fledglings left the nest-box at Chester Zoo with tails only half the
adult length, each tail feather still growing basally, enclosed within its
waxy sheath.
The fledglings lacked the gloss of the adults and had dark eyes compared
to the bright white or pale yellowish eyes of the adult. The dark eye col-
our is retained for at least the first year. The young bird fledged in May
1986, still had noticeably darker eyes than the breeding adults when it was
20 months old.

many of the other occupants of the Tropical House but generally behaved
reasonably amicably. Although they were dominant over many smaller
species at the feeding area, this has not created any management problems.
However, whilst nesting the birds became noticeably aggressive especially
in the area of the nest-site. The adult male spent long periods on guard
near the nest-box and chased off any birds which approached the box too
closely. Aggression was particularly addressed to Bar-tailed Cuckoo Doves
Macropygia unchall but Speckled Pigeons Columba guinea , Schalows
Touracos Tauraco schalowi and one particular Spreo Starling Spreo super-
bus that was anxious to feed the young Long-tails figured prominently
amongst other birds harrassed.
Most chases were initiated by the adult male but occasionally either of
the two immature Starlings or the female would supplant or chase birds
near the nest. On several occasions all four Long-tailed Glossy Starlings
chased Bar-tailed Cuckoo Doves until these were exhausted. The female
Cuckoo Doves were particularly selected for this rough treatment. The
breast barring of these doves, shared with both cuckoos and accipiters -
neither of which would be welcome near a nest, may have been the par-
ticular stimulus that elicited this concerted aggressive behaviour from the
breeding Long-tailed Glossy Starlings.
Helping at the nest
It was previously noted how non-breeding youngsters were seen to
help their parents in feeding chicks in the nest. This behaviour was studied
in some detail for the nest of October/November 1987 when an older,
immature bird, bred in May 1986 and a yearling fledged in May 1987 were
seen to assist in rearing the chicks. This assistance involved helping to
chase away potential nest predators and feeding the chicks as nestlings
and later fledglings. Nest hygiene was solely the province of the breeding
female. On 13 occasions, when I observed faecal sacs being removed, this
duty was always performed by the female, and only she remained in the
nest to brood the chicks for any extended period.
The adult male and both immatures would briefly enter the nest with
food but would hesitate and wait until the female had left the nest area
before feeding the chicks. On one occasion the female threatened the
oldest immature that was delivering food to the chicks and in the week
before the chicks were fledged, she repeatedly supplanted the youngest
immature, preventing it from feeding chicks in the box. She would also
steal food from the waiting adult male and both immatures in order to
feed the chicks herself and was clearly dominant at the nest forcing
herself past other birds waiting with food near the nest entrance.

Table 2 shows the number of feeding visits made by each bird over a
series of one-hour observation periods. Feeding visits when food was stolen
by the adult female are here attributed to the bird bringing the food even
if it did not itself carry the food to the nest. The breeding female fed the
chicks more frequently than any other individual especially in the week
prior to the fledging of the first chick on 14th November. The male made
surprisingly few feeding visits to the nest but this time was taken in senti-
nel duties and nest defence.
The older immature contributed significantly to the total number of
feeding visits and on one occasion was also seen to carry nesting material
into the box. After fledging the work of feeding the young birds was more
evenly shared, although the female still accounted for the greatest percent-
age of all feeds and was observed still feeding the chicks over a month after
they had fledged.

BREEDING ACTIVITIES AT THE SAN DIEGO ZOO,
CALIFORNIA, DURING 1987
By ALAN LIEBERMAN
(Curator, Ornithology Department)
The Bird Department at the San Diego Zoo had remarkable breeding
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.983333952380953" page_id="56240898"  page_num="154" year="" vol="">
success during the year 1987 (1st January to 31st December). Totals were
79 species hatched for a grand total of 492 individuals. The following
table details the species hatched, whether they were parent-set or artifi-
cially-set, and chick survivorship.
One of the programmes initiated in 1987 was an off-exhibit unit dedi-
cated to hand-rearing altricial species in addition to the traditional preco-
cial species, to encourage double-clutching and to increase the Bird Depart-
ment's expertise and capacity to rear nidiculous chicks successfully. To
mention a few of the species which were successfully double-clutched with
chicks being reared artificially and naturally during the same season, were:
Palawan Peacock Pheasant, Grey-winged Trumpeter, Sun Bittern, Duiven-
bode's Lory, Stella's Lory, Blue and Gold Macaw, Gray Go-away Bird,
Thailand Bay Owl, Fairy Bluebird, and Asiatic Azure-winged Magpie.
The additional advantage of hand-rearing is one of 'risk reduction' for
pairs and species that are notoriously bad parents, especially in captivity.
This is true of nearly all the pheasant species and many of the waterfowl.
The breeding of eight gallinaceous species, many of which were F ^ from
wild stock, will greatly enhance the available genetic variability in coming
seasons. A highlight of the season was the successful artificial insemination
and subsequent rearing of three chicks from wild-caught and Fj Chinese
Monals.

My first experience with the Chestnut or Chocolate Weaver was in the
aviaries of the late William Collard, Director of the Natal Zoological
Gardens. My photograph of the male southern subspecies P. r. trothae does
not do it justice, so I wish to describe this striking, unmistakeable bird.
In breeding plumage, it has the forehead, crown, nape, sides of face and
upper breast black; the mantle, back and lower breast are chestnut; the
rump and upper tail-coverts greyish chestnut; the tail blackish tinged with
green on the tips; wings blackish, edged with white to pale buff; the iris
orange-brown, bill black and the legs and feet light grey. In non-breeding
plumage it is similar to the female with blackish crown washed with
yellowish buff and tinged with green; the mantle, back, rump and upper
tail coverts are olive-brown; the eyebrow and below eye yellowish; flanks
pale brown; underparts white; bill horn coloured. The northern nominate
subspecies is darker reddish brown, less chestnut and in non-breeding
plumage is generally richer in coloration. Immatures are similar to the
non-breeding adults.
This species is gregarious at all times, generally sparse and a partial
migrant in the non-breeding season. It inhabits acacia woodland and has
been recorded in the northern regions as entering wheat cultivation. The
range of the nominate race is from Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, Kenya
south to northern Tanzania. P.r. trochae is found in Namibia (Damaraland
highlands, Kaokoveld and Ovamboland). Its extreme limit is south-
western Angola.
Clancey (1985) states that feeding data for wild Chestnut Weavers is
little known, but they have been recorded feeding on grain, seeds, insects
and probably also aloe flowers and other soft vegetable matter. In capti-
vity they have been recorded as feeding on the seeds of Stapf s buffalo
grass Panicum stapfianum , black seed panicum P. novemnerve and Guinea
grass P. maximum , a cultivated crop in the form of pounded yellow maize,
the nectar of flat-crowned aloe Aloe marlothii, candelabrum aloe A.
candelabrum and Krantz aloe A. arborescens ; insects, namely termites,
beetle larvae, including mealworms, and the only arthropod in the form of
spiders.
Breeding in its natural state takes place from January to March in the
south, and from March to July in the north. It constructs a very untidy,

retort-shaped structure of green grass blades and a vertical entrance spout
of 6-7 cm long. The lining is of grass inflorescences and a few feathers
which are arranged by the female. Nests have an external length of about
21 cm and an external height of about 17 cm. Nests are attached to
drooping branches of trees, mostly Acacia spp. and Eucalyptus spp. In
Namibia, Braine et al (1971) observed at least 100 trees being occupied
with anything from about 40-100 nests in each. At times the Chestnut
Weaver may nest in close proximity to Masked Weavers Ploceus velatus.
Two to four eggs are laid and are white to pale greenish or light blue.
Egg measurements (26): 22.5 x 15.7 (20,4-24.5 x 14,5-16.8). Incubation
is probably by female only as males are known to desert the colony at the
egg or chick stage. In captivity three to four eggs are laid, but due to the
few birds being kept in aviaries, breeders are reluctant to record the incuba-
tion in fear of causing the birds to abandon the nests. Nestling period is
recorded at about 18 to 20 days. A survey on the breeding of Chestnut

SPECIES REPORT: THE HISPANIOLAN CONURE
Aratinga chloroptera

'If conservation is concerned with the survival of endangered species of
birds, then private aviculturists must be recognised as an invaluable asset in
the realisation of the goal. The general public is led to believe that conser-
vation is the saving of rare species, but rarely told that many species living
under the threat of extinction could be saved simply by the application of
sound avicultural techniques.
'At a time when natural habitats are being systematically destroyed,
due to an understandable desire of people to realise the full commercial
potential of their land, it is essential that aviculturists should also be
allowed to show their full potential. Failure to give aviculture a fair chance
to prove its worth, will be to deny certain species their best chance of
survival.'
C. Blackwell, Cage and Aviary Birds, 6th November, 1982: 1
When I read the above statement by Chris Blackwell several years ago, I
nodded my head in agreement; this view is still with me for now, more
than ever, aviculture will have to figure in conservation programmes if a
large part of the parrots now extant are to remain so when it is time to
greet the next century.

The Hispaniolan Conure is just one such species. A largely green conure
which could easily be confused with the White-eyed A. leucophthalmus or
Mexican Green A holochlora, it is not considered attractive by most;
indeed, had I not become familiar with this bird, 1 probably would have
been of the same belief. However, it is very different from either the
White-eyed or Mexican Green: its bill is of a different shade, the orbital
ring is very white but the eyelids are greyish, it has red under wing coverts
(not accompanied by yellow as in leucophthalmus , or yellowish-green as in
holochlora ) and is far shyer and quieter. It is also endangered, whereas the
Mexican Green and White-eyed are common, sometimes very common, in
parts of their range.
Joseph Forshaw (1978) gives two subspecies under chloroptera: the
nominate A. chloroptera chloroptera and the subspecies A. c. maugei. How-
ever, this needs revising, for Storrs Olsson (pers. comm., 1987) conclu-
ded, after analysing the bones of both, that they differ sufficiently,
especially in the shape of the bill, to be considered as separate species.
Prior to 1976 A. maugei was known fpr certain to have occupied Mona
Island; that year Oleson identified bones as belonging to that species in
caves in central Puerto Rico. Much speculation existed prior to this evi-
dence, because, whilst such distinguished ornithologists as Juan Gundlach
and Alexander Wetmore (1927) wrote of the conure, none was able to
collect or observe it in the wild. The situation was described by Wetmore
thus: Tn 1912 I was told by a number of persons that paroquets were still
in existence, but always at a distance point that ever receded before me; so
that I never entered what were, according to popular accounts, their
haunts&amp;apos;.
On Mona Island, the situation was very different. Before it became
extinct in 1892, three specimens were collected, the last by Wilmot W.
Brown. 1 examined the immature female in the Field Museum of Natural
History collection. At the time I wrote in my notes: &quot;Poorly differentiated
and probably invalid subspecies. Until measurements of both subspecies
are taken and analised, perhaps by a computer, the true status of maugei
cannot be determined.' Things have certainly changed.
The factors contributing to the decline and subsequent extinction of
maugei , which despite now being classified as a separate species, is closely
related to chloroptera , are unknown. Bond (1946) suggested that pigeon
hunters who regularly travelled to Mona Island in the last century extir-
pated the conure there. On Puerto Rico, where it is reported to have
disappeared by 1833 (Greenway, 1967), though it probably met its end
sometime later even less is known about its disappearance. One can conjec-
ture that lumbering of timber during the 1800s and early 1900s attributed
to the ebb, or like chloroptera on Hispaniola, it had difficulty adapting to

living commensally with man.
Sadly, nothing can now be done to reprieve this species, but the future
of chloroptera need not necessarily follow the path of maugei.
On Hispaniola, the second largest island in the Greater Antilles, com-
posed of Haiti to the west and the Dominican Republic to the east, it is
found from sea level to 3000m (9842 ft). Its habitat here is varied, ranging
from arid scrub to lush forest in the mountains, where it is most num-
erous. Seasonally it is present on the island of Beata and Soana, off the
coast of the Dominican Republic, but even then it is not plentiful. Its
status on the mainland seems to vary considerably between areas.
Haiti has been largely deforested and there the conure is very rare,
possibly even nearing extinction. This is a clear indication of the ebb,
because Danforth (1929) encountered thousands daily in early July in the
region between Mirebalais, Haiti, and San Juan in the Dominican Republic.
In the Dominican Republic it has traditionally been more plentiful, al-
though several devastating hurricanes, loss of habitat and shooting when it
raids corn crops have had a negative impact. Further, a dam was construc-
ted earlier this decade in the region of San Juan de la Maguana, where it
was particularly plentiful; its effects on the population are as yet unknown
(Annabelle Dod, in lift ., 1980).
Given the likelihood that man will continue to make inroads into its
habitat, one can expect the decline to continue, perhaps at an accelerated
pace. To establish a foundation stock in captivity to safeguard the species
would be a positive step in its preservation.
My interest in this species started in the mid-1970s, after I examined
the last individual taken on Mona Island. A search then began that resulted
in a singleton being obtained in June 1981. It was a hand-reared bird, with
a slightly dropped wing which impeded long flight and had the tendency
to pluck its breast, who was received in 1975 by Van Saun Park Zoo in
Pa ram us, New Jersey.
This particular bird showed aggression to other parrots, but for some
unknown reason this is especially so with Petz's or Half-moon Conures
Aratinga canicularis. I conjectured that this behaviour may have arisen
after an injury was received, perhaps by a canicularis.
Whilst I waited for a Hispaniolan hen to surface - my hope was that
someone would have one as a pet and would respond to my numerous
pleas - several other Aratingas were offered as potential mates. Almost
invariably he responded with attacks, until a Nanday Conure was placed
with him. He walked over to her and regurgitated food, which she immedi-
ately accepted; they mated about a month later.
I am not in favour of hybridising unless it is done with a specific
reason in mind. In this case, the Nanday was offered in the hopes that they

would nest and that some clues about the male's potential as a father
would surface. Moreover, any hybrid young would be paired back to the
father, in the hopes of trying to establish a line of chloroptera.
The pair agreed very well, although they both resented my hands inside
the cage when removing food and water bowls. If I merely stood in front
of the enclosure, he would stand between me and the female and would
lunge, scream and sometimes fly at the wire.
Around 10th November 1985, the female disappeared into the nest.
Five days later an egg was found, having been laid exactly two months
after the pair was united. Three more followed. The hen sat extremely
tightly and the male now chided me loudly from the nest entrance - he
would not charge or lunge. On 8th December the first chick hatched,
followed by two more, on 11th and 13th. All were removed for hand-
rearing because the pair had not fed the first two chicks very well and it
was feared that they would die.
The hybrid young all fledged and were followed by many more. They
resembled the male, though underparts had a yellowish tinge, with some
feathers showing a trace of orange. Cheeks and wings had a bronze cast,
upper breast had a bluish tinge, and crown was a shade of dark green, al-
most the colour of olive. Orbital ring was large and just slightly off-white.
The bill was large and horn-coloured as in chloroptera , except that there
was a greyish tinge near the base.
A bird that particularly resembled the male was produced in September
1982. The following year this father-daughter pair produced eggs, but all
were clear, presumably because of her young age.
All of this time, my search continued. One afternoon in late 1984
the unexpected happened: a man called, after having seen my mention of
the species, and offered me his six chloroptera , all having been imported
from Haiti. Could this be another wrong lead, I wondered? I had gone
after several birds, always to meet a White-eyed, but this opportunity was
unique - the birds had come from Haiti and had been privately imported.
When they finally arrived, I could not believe my eyes. They were genuine
chloropteral Luck was certainly on my side, for surgical sexing proved
them to be three pairs.
One pair went to Greg Isaacs, this moving taking place so that should
an unfortunate catastrophe strike, all would not be lost. They nested and
in 1985 several young were reared.
The next year the pair and young were received back, after Greg decid-
ed to reduce his collection. By then my chloroptera had already nested
and since this time a considerable number of young have been reared. This
year alone over 15 fledged.

The young chloroptera are much like their parents, except that the red
on the underside of the wings is mixed with green and the bill has greyish
colour near the base of the cutting edge. They are weaned by 12 weeks
and attain sexual maturity by one year old.
We have placed pairs with several aviculturists and hope to continue
doing so in the future. If sufficient pairs are distributed, we will be able to
see the establishment of this conure. The largest obstacle we encountered
is the ratio of males to females produced; for every hen there are at least
two available males. Another disappointment has been the lack of interest
from aviculturists. Many appear only interested in breeding those species
that will produce great monetary rewards; the gratitude of having helped
to establish an endangered species appears not to be sufficient reward.
The chance of establishing an endangered species in aviculture, especi-
ally one that appears willing to reproduce, is not one that will likely repeat
itself. Seizing this opportunity will allow us to look back at some future
point and remark that the 1980s was not a decade of lost opportunity.

THRAUPIDAE - Tanagers
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.973517444444444" page_id="56240911"  page_num="167" year="" vol="">
An increasing number of bird species, especially those from Central
and South America, are now imported from Europe rather than from
their country of origin. In many bird families such as the tanagers, the
reduction in the number of birds has been notable. However, a consid-
erable number of the species once regularly imported has been available.
Euphonic species listed have included the Violaceous, Orange-crowned,
Orange-bellied and Thick-billed.
Chlorophonia - the Blue-naped and the Blue-crowned.
The large Tan. gar a genus has been well-represented by the Turquoise,

The genus Thraupis is small, consisting of eight species, four of which
have been imported fairly frequently in recent years: the Palm, Blue-grey,
Sayaca and the Blue and Yellow.
Other genera listed have included:
Anisoganthus - the Black-chinned, Blue-winged and Laerimose Moun-
tain Tanagers.
Buthraupis - the Hooded Mountain Tanager and the Blue and Gold.
Ramphocelus - the Silver-beaked, Masked Crimson, Pirangor , White-
winged Tanager, Habia, Red-crowned Ant Tanager, Tachyphonus, White-
lined, Flame-crested, Stephanophorus , Diademed Tanager, Lanio , Fulvous
Shrike-tanager, Ossopis , Magpie tanager, Schistochlamys , Black-faced
Tanager. The monotypic Swallow Tanager Tersina viridis, which is listed
as a sub-family Tersininae, or given family status Tersinidae in some tax-
onomic works, has been imported occasionally.

Many species in this large family have been available in recent years,
including a number of possible first importations.
The genus Yuhina has been represented by the Striated, Yellow-naped,
White-collared, Black-chinned, White-bellied and the Formosan Yuhina - a
first U.K. breeding (Beeson, 1984) and probable first importation.
The most frequently imported Sibia species for many years is the
Black-headed. Other species listed since 1980 have included the Long-
tailed, Grey Sibia and White-eared Heterophasia auricularis.
The monotypic Capuchin Babbler Phyllanthus atripennis has been
listed.
The Fulvettas Alcippe have been represented by the Grey-cheeked
and Brown-eared.
Barwings Actinodura - the Spectacled Barwirtg and the Streaked.
The genus Leiothrix includes the Pekin Robin, the most frequently
imported and popular softbill. The number bred in captivity has shown
a welcome increase in recent years, indicating this species could be estab-
lished as a breeding species in the U.K. Its congener, the Silver-eared
Mesia has been imported fairly frequently in small numbers.
The Red-faced Liocichla has been available in recent years and, on a
few occasions, Steere's Liocichla.
Garrulax species - the Hwamei Laughing Thrush, Greater and Lesser
Necklaced, the White-crested and White-throated have been fairly regular
imports for many years. A number of interesting species seldom impor-
ted have been available since 1980. These have included the Red-winged,

THE PRESIDENT S GARDEN PARTY
Sunday, 6th June, 1988

One hundred members and guests gathered at Chestnut Lodge, Cob-
ham, at the kind invitation of Miss Ruth Ezra and Mr. Raymond Sawyer,
President and Vice President of the Avicultural Society. Such is the popu-
larity of this annual event that half as many again could not obtain tickets.
The birds, grounds and hospitality were delightful as always and even
the weather was kinder than in 1987. The sky threatened rain just before
tea but then cleared quite miraculously - our thanks to whoever prayed at
the right moment.
Each year there are new arrivals to admire in the bird collection, includ-
ing species new to most if not all the visitors, but an even greater pleasure
is to see the results of the breeding successes achieved each year; 1988 has
so far been the best breeding season at Chestnut Lodge for many years.
Splendid and Royal Starlings were feeding young in the nest, as were
Azure-winged Magpies, with a second nest containing eggs less than a
metre away (these sociable birds also shared their aviary with the breeding
Splendid Starlings). A good crop of Avocet and Black-winged Stilt chicks
was on view and incubating birds included Peruvian Thick-knees, Black
Brant, Violaceous Touracos and Plumbeous Redstarts. (The Plumbeous
Redstarts later successfully reared young and this is believed to be for the
first time in Britain.) Red-crested Touracos had lost their eggs to other
birds (since removed to another aviary) and Varied Tits had hatched, but
failed to rear, chicks. A number of other species was breeding, ranging

from parrots to waterfowl, and amongst young successfully reared were
two Keas, two Stella's Lorikeets, a Kookaburra, two Orinoco Geese, one
Ringed Plover, Spreo Starlings and an Oystercatcher.
Among the new arrivals were birds in two groups obviously highly
regarded at Chestnut Lodge: Livingstone's Touraco and White-bellied
Go-away Bird bring the number of touraco species to seven, and the addi-
tion of the magnificent Spotted Laughing-thrush and the lovely little
Chestnut-capped makes at least eight species of Garrulax. Notable among
the other new birds was a pair of South American Golden-fronted Wood-
peckers in beautiful condition and perhaps nicest of all, a pair of Long-
tailed Broadbills already looking very much at home in the tropical house.
Once again we are most grateful to our hosts for giving members such a
wonderful afternoon. Miss Ezra presided over a most lavish and delicious
tea and Mr. Sawyer went to great lengths to show the birds to everyone
and answer questions. The gardens were looking at their very best and
were a beautiful setting for a very pleasant occasion. As an added bonus,
Miss Ezra most generously donated the ticket money to the Society's
funds and together with donations, this came to #250.

By Brian J. Coates. Published by Dove Publications, Australia. Available
from Messrs. Wheldon &amp; Wesley, Lytton Lodge, Codicote, Hitchin, Herts..
SG4 8TE. Price #50.00. ISBN 0 9590257.
This is the first of two volumes in this title and together they will
make a very significant contribution to the literature on the wonderfully
rich avifauna of this region.
Volume I is beautifully produced and the photography, mainly by
the author, is outstanding. Over half of the bird species found in Papua
New Guinea are to be illustrated and this volume contains 493 photo-
graphs of 232 species, some never previously photographed.
Of the total 740 bird species occurring in the Papua New Guinea
region, including the Bismark Archipelago and Bougainville, 377 are des-
cribed in this volume. The account of each species includes field descrip-
tions, details of distribution, habitats frequented, altitudinal ranges,
ecological niche, status, unusual records, behaviour diet, voice, breeding,
and subspecies. There are distribution maps for all species except some
vagrants and 44 line drawings of posture and distinctive species not shown
in the photographs. A bibliography and index is in each volume.
Valuable and interesting though the text is, I suspect that the book will
be bought for the photographs, taken of the birds in their natural habitat,
which are outstanding and reproduced in superb quality.

The two previous volumes of this important work have been reviewed
in this journal. Volume III completes the coverage of the non-passerine
family and marks the halfway point in fulfilling the late Leslie Brown's
dream of a handbook which would describe all the birds of the African
Continent. It was a very ambitious project and so far it has been brilliantly
achieved.
As in Volume II, invited experts describe each species under a com-
prehensive set of headings. African breeding species are covered in full
with sections on range and status, description, voice, general habits, food
and breeding biology. Non-breeding migrants are treated more briefly with

emphasis on their status and behaviour while in Africa. English, French
and scientific names are given.
As before Martin Woodcock has painted the colour plates and these are
the best so far in that he has found better solutions to the problem of
combining portraits of a great many birds on one page, whilst obeying the
laws of good composition, not at all an easy task. The colour reproduction
is excellent.
The two previous volumes are still available, each at #71.50: Volume I -
Gamebirds to Pigeons; Volume II - Ostrich to Falcon. Whilst a considerable
outlay is required to collect the set, it will be without doubt the major
source of up-to-date material on African birds and an indispensable refer-
ence for many years to come.
A DICTIONARY OF BIRDS
Edited by Bruce Campbell and Elizabeth Lack. Published by T. and A.D.
Poyser Ltd. Price #39.00. ISBN 08566 K039 9.
Compiled for the British Ornithologists Union, this important new
work is, in effect, a replacement for A New Dictionary of Birds by Sir
Landsborough Thomson (1964) which in turn replaced A Dictionary of
Birds by Professor Alfred Newton (1896).
Major contributions from over 270 ornithologists around the world give
authoritative accounts covering the whole field of modern ornithology.
This new work, 704 pages long and encyclopaedic in treatment, ranges
from general subjects such as fossil birds, migration, parental care, bird
anatomy, and morphology, to descriptions of all bird families and to man-
related topics such as falconry, photography, birds as pests and so on. In
all, over 800,000 words, supported by 500 photographs, diagrams and
drawings. With Robert Gillmor as Art Editor and Eric Hosking as Photo-
graphic Editor, the illustrations are, as one would expect, of a very high
quality.
Briefly...
OPERATION CHOUGH is a most attractively produced booklet
containing a collection of interesting articles on this endangered bird with
some excellent illustrations. The 'Operation' referred to is a Glasgow
University Project to return this species, now extinct in Cornwall, to its
former territory there. H.R.H. Prince Charles, The Duke of Cornwall,
wrote the Foreword, Malcolm Ellis was Honorary Editor and many other
people donated their services to producing it so that profits from the
sales can go towards further funding of the project. Available at #1.95

Professor J.R. Hodges (Chairman of Council) writes:
'On my way to Australia recently I spent a few days in Bangkok. I was
fortunate to stay in the Ambassador Hotel which is not only an excellent
hotel but also accommodates a remarkable collection of birds. Large
aviaries bordering the car park house many specimens of several species
of macaw including Hyacinthine, several Eclectus Parrots, Moluccan,
White and Sulphur-crested Cockatoos, flamingoes and other birds. The
tables of the Sea Food Restaurant in the roof garden are discreetly arranged
close to attractive aviaries containing such rare and beautiful birds as
Leadbeater's, Palm and White-tailed Black Cockatoos, many more macaws
and several species of smaller South American parrots. One large, planted
aviary contains birds of paradise. The space between the towers in which
are several of the hotel's restaurants is converted into an enclosure, beauti-
fully planted with tropical flowering plants, bamboo, etc. which contains
Victoria Crowned Pigeons and many exotic softbills.
T was particularly impressed by the excellent condition of all of the
birds. The macaws and cockatoos were immaculate with hardly a feather
out of place in contrast to those which one sees too often in zoos and bird

obviously thoroughly cleaned and food replaced in spotless containers
early every morning. I can recommend thoroughly a stop off in Bangkok
at this delightful hotel for any aviculturist travelling to Australia.'

Fred Barnicoat, a Vice President of the Society, writes from South
Africa:
'The South African National Championship Show for 1988 was staged
in Durban during July. With its warm, subtropical climate this attractive
venue drew exhibitors from all over South Africa. Mr. Brian Binns was
brought out from England to judge the Zebra Finches, and this event was
one of the main highlights of the show. The exhibition of Zebra Finches
has shown rapid strides in South Africa in recent years, and good stock
has been imported from the U.K. Also the availability of many of the new
mutations from the Continent, such as the Black-breasted, Orange-breasted,
Light-backed, Phaeo and Isabel has greatly stimulated interest. Nearly
three and a half thousand birds were on show, of which almost 900 were
wild birds and many rarities were to be seen. The supreme award was given
to an immaculate Black-bellied Firefinch Lagonosticta rara owned by
M. Wills. The medal for the rare breeding -of the year was awarded at the
Conference, and was won by Dr. W.D. Russell for breeding the Jardine's

From Neville Brickell (Avicultural Research Unit, South Africa):
Tn my article "The Lemon-breasted Canary Sennas citrinipectus "
(Vol 89, No. 3, pp. 159-160), I stated that in South Africa it extended
as far south as Stanger in the province of Natal. It was later found that the
two observations recorded from this area were escapees when thieves
broke into an aviary in the area. They were extremely tame and subse-
quently caught. This species southernmost limit at present is the Umfolozi

The Royal Australian Ornithologists' Union have published a con-
servation statement by John Martindale on the Freckled Duck Stic-
tonetta naevosa which is illustrated by some fine coloured photographs.
The Freckled Duck is one of Australia's, and the world's, rarest ducks.
It occurs mainly in the eastern, south-eastern and south-western parts of
mainland Australia but, even now, the areas in which it breeds are not
completely known. The data which is available so far suggests that it may
have specific requirements for its breeding habitat.
The Freckled Duck appears to feed mainly on crustaceans and aquatic
plants, but little else is known about its ecology. Surveys undertaken
during the 1983 drought indicate that a relatively small number of perma-
nent wetlands provide vital refuges for Freckled Ducks when their other
habitats dry out during prolonged droughts. While in these refuges, this
protected species is particularly vulnerable to illegal shooting.
Conservation of the Freckled Duck requires protection of its breeding
habitat and of its drought refuges, as well as special measures during
droughts to prevent illegal shooting of large numbers. Research is needed
to define fully its breeding range and breeding habitat requirements.
Dietary and other ecological data are also needed.

A very enjoyable Garden Party was given by our President, Miss Ruth
Ezra, and Vice-President, Mr. Raymond Sawyer, on Sunday 6th June, at
Chestnut Lodge, Cobham. A full account may be found on page 170 of
this issue.
A successful Dinner was held on Saturday, 9th July, at Duke of Yorks
Headquarters, Chelsea. Seventy-five members and guests took part and we
have been asked to repeat it next year when we hope that more members
will be encouraged to come. After an excellent dinner speeches were kept
short and were generally light-hearted. Amongst the speakers was Mr.
Brian Byles, Editor of Cage and Aviary Birds , who recalled the role that
the Avicultural Society and particularly the Avicultural Magazine had
played in the past and asked members to give very careful consideration to
the future of aviculture.
The evening finished with dancing for the energetic and a very good
raffle that raised over #85 for the Society's funds. Those who wished to
talk were not disturbed by the music as the premises are large and the
volume was kept very low. The Headquarters Club at the Duke of Yorks
Headquarters, Kings Road, Chelsea, has the great advantage of private,
guarded parking in the centre of London and the caterer's charges must be
the most reasonable one could find.
Our especial thanks are due to Mrs. Peggy Winsor for rallying so much
support, to Mr. Ken Lawrence for being such an excellent Master of
Ceremonies, to those who brought flower arrangements for the tables
and raffle prizes, and generally to all the members who supported the
event and helped to make it such a success.
On Saturday, 6th August, 80 members and guests visited Leeds Castle,
Maidstone, Kent, at the invitation of the directors and the Curator of
Birds, Mr. David Frank.
The party was given a conducted tour of the magnificent new aviaries
that have been built in the lovely grounds of the Castle and admired the
many interesting and innovative design features. A full account of these
aviaries will be published in the next issue of the Magazine.
In view of the heatwave some members opted for a picnic lunch but
those who went to the restaurant praised it highly. We were then free
to tour the Castle and grounds until 3.30 p.m. when we all gathered in the
cool of the Gatehouse Tower for a lavish cream tea. We would like to

thank David Frank and his Head Keeper, Keith Mitchell, very much indeed
for giving up their time to give us such a wonderful day and to thank the
directors of Leeds Castle Foundation for their generous hospitality. I am
sure that everyone who came that day was most impressed by what has
already been achieved and will look forward to seeing further develop-
ments.
The next social meeting will be held on Saturday, 15th October, at
Warren Hill, Hartley Wintney. It will be a buffet lunch, followed by a lec-
ture and tea. Details will be circulated separately.
The demand for tickets both for the President's Garden Party and the
visit to Leeds Castle greatly exceeded the number available and quite a
few members had to be disappointed. This was a great pity, of course, but
unavoidable and, in fact, the main reason for this increase is a welcome
one, i.e. the many new English members that we are recruiting at present.
On both occasions tickets were allocated strictly on a 'first-come, first-
served' basis and we will continue to adhere to this in the future. If we
are invited by someone who can only take so many people, then the alter-
native to this is to refuse their kind invitation. We still have our spring
and autumn social meetings where all can come and be sure to meet their
friends - though mostly the complaints came from people who do not
come to these ordinary meetings.

Since John Yealland died in 1983, the bird artist Richard Daniel has
read the proofs of the Avicultural Magazine with meticulous attention to
detail. Initially he volunteered to fill the gap 'until someone else could be
found, just to help out', but he became indispensable. Now, having achieved
a new studio, with ideal conditions, Richard wants to devote himself full-
time to bifd painting and has asked to be replaced. We are so grateful to
him for all his hours of painstaking checking and wish him well with his
painting.
We are also very grateful to David Coles who continues to read the
proofs to check the avicultural content and suggests many useful amend-
ments. What we now need is a proof-reader with a general knowledge and
interest in birds but particularly a very sharp eye for mistakes in spelling,
grammar, punctuation and printing errors generally. There is no fee for
this work, I am afraid, but the deep gratitude of the Editor for helping to
keep the Magazine to its present high standard. A volunteer is needed now
and urgently please!

First breeding claim
As described in Volume 94, Nos. 1/2, page 83, Mrs. Rosemary Wiseman
bred the Desmaresf s Fig Parrot Psittaculirostris desrmrestii in 1984 and
this is believed to be the first success in this country. Anyone knowing of
a previous breeding in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, or of any other
reason that would disqualify this claim, is asked to contact the Hon. Sec-
retary.
Foreign Bird Federation Breeding Census
We now have a copy of the Census prepared for the years 1984-1987
by the Foreign Bird Federation and if any member would like a copy,
please apply to me with a stamped, addressed envelope and #2.00 to cover
the cost of photocopying.
The Avicultural Society is affiliated to the Foreign Bird Federation and
committed to supporting this project. Inserted with this issue of the
Avicultural Magazine is the form for the*. 1988 Census. We do appeal to
British members to support this important project because the more
breedings that are recorded, the better will be the picture of aviculture
portrayed to the public generally. Information will be treated with
absolute confidentiality and the form can be returned anonymously if
required. Any correspondence or enquiries concerning this Census please
send to Mr. R.E. Oxley, 2 Buttons Avenue, Hornchurch, Essex RM12 41F.

The Crimson-rumped Toucanet, one of the smaller merhbgTs a of the
toucan family, is widely distributed in north-western South America, from
Venezuela to the subtropical zones of Ecuador.
This species' most distinctive features are its blood red rump and
chestnut beak (hence the alternative name Chestnut-billed Toucanet),
which has a broad white stripe at the base. The beak is about 314-4 in
(0.09-0.10m) long, with the male's beak often slightly longer than the fe-
male's. The body plumage is mainly green, with a blue tinge across the
breast; the tail is green with a chestnut tip. There is a maroon orbital ring
around the eyes. The legs and feet are grey. This species measures overall
about 15 in long (0.38 m), with the male usually larger than the female.
Our pair are housed in an outside aviary, in a corner formed by two
Cornish stone walls. The aviary measures approximately 4 x 3.5m and is
3m high at the back, sloping down to 2.5m at the front. The floor is
mainly grass with an earth border and earth beneath the perches to aid
cleaning. The aviary is planted with several bushes of Himalayan Honey-
suckle Leycesteria formosa (the berries of which are enjoyed by the birds)
and one of the walls is covered with ivy. There is a hollowed out log in
the corner formed by the two stone walls and two nesting holes in the
wall.
The toucanets' diet consists mainly of apple, with soaked raisins,
banana and orange. They also receive other fruits when in season. In
addition they are given our own insectivorous mix. Livefood is offered
occasionally, although usually it is not eaten. All food is liberally sprinkled
with Vionate multi-vitamin powder.

In 1982 two young were reared and Padstow Bird Gardens was awarded
the Avicultural Society's Certificate of Merit for the first captive breeding
of this species in Britain (Evans and Coles, 1982). Since then the Crimson-
rumped Toucanet has bred here on a number of occasions - two young
were reared in 1984, three in 1985 and one in 1987. The parents were not
always the same two birds.
The chicks are reared usually by the female only, as the male becomes
aggressive shortly after the chicks have hatched. He is, therefore, removed
to a holding flight and not returned until the chicks are weaned and
removed from the aviary.
After the 1985 breeding season, just before we planned to return the
male to the aviary, we found him dead on the floor of the holding flight.
He had a broken neck and obviously had been disturbed during the night,
probably by a cat.
Eventually, after a long search we acquired a newly-imported bird. This
arrived on 23rd June 1986. It was in excellent condition and so, after a
couple of days of isolation it was put into the aviary with the female. She
attacked him immediately and, therefore, was removed to a holding flight
to allow the male to settle into his new environment; Several days later
the female was re-introduced and minutes later again began chasing the
male.
Both birds were caught and placed in adjoining holding flights, which
allowed them to see each other without actually being in direct contact.
Some weeks later a partition was removed from between the two flights
and the birds allowed in together. No more fighting occurred, so a week
later both birds were returned to the aviary. By that time it was mid-
August, too late for any nesting that season, but in plenty of time to
settle down for the next.
First signs of nesting activity were seen on 24th February 1987 when
both birds began chipping at the entrance hole in the log. On inspection,
however, we discovered there was a large hole in the far side, obviously
made by the female when she was last sitting.
On 3rd March the female was seen entering one of the holes in the
wall of the aviary. Both birds continued to enter this hole, although it
seemed as though somehow it was not really to their satisfaction.
On 24th March a new nesting log was acquired and the old one re-
placed. As soon as we left the aviary, both birds began looking into the
hole and chipping around it. The next day there were many chippings
on the ground beneath the log and during the afternoon the female was
seen emerging from the entrance hole. Both birds continued going in and
out and chipping away, until 13th April onwards, when at least one
remained inside the log. It seemed as though incubation had started.

On 3rd May small pieces of white eggshell were found on the ground.
The male was observed carrying food into the log, although no sounds
could be heard coming from inside. On 15th May both birds were seen
away from the nest and on inspection it was found to be empty.
On 31st May both birds again began spending much time in the log
and five days later, whilst they were (ceding, a quick inspection revealed
three eggs. Incubation was shared by both birds, although the male spent
less time inside; he would feed the female. On 18th June, after approxi-
mately 17 days 5 incubation, the male became very active and hunted on
the ground for snails, earthworms, etc. Faint squeaks could be heard
coming from the log.
Additional food was given in the form of crickets, mealworms (most
of which were ignored) and more fruit, such as tomatoes, grapes, pears,
plums and peaches. What they seemed to show most interest in was snails
and these we collected from the many dry stone walls in this area.
AH went well with the chicks 5 cries becoming louder and both parents
industriously feeding them. That was until 1st July, when that morning
the female was found sitting on the edge of the pond, looking decidedly
ill and drinking a lot of water. As it was a warm, sunny day, it was decided
to leave her outside, to save her the stress of being moved to different
surroundings. We called the veterinarian who gave the female multi-vitamin
and antibiotic injections. He did not hold out much hope and indeed by
late afternoon her condition had deteriorated rapidly and she died. The
post-mortem revealed the cause of death as acute enteritis and she also
had a degree of gout. Kidney failure apparently was caused by a batch of
bad fish meal that we had put into the insectivorous mix (since then fish
meal has not been used).
We then had to decide what to do about the chicks. Due to the male&amp;apos;s
past unfavourable behaviour towards the female when the chicks hatched,
we did not know whether to leave them with him to rear or remove the
chicks and attempt to hand-rear them. We decided on the latter. It was
not an easy decision to make, for as far as we know, at that time nobody
in this country had hand-reared any sort of toucan.
Two chicks were taken from the nest (there was no sign of the third egg
or another chick). The chicks were quite large and fleshy. They had no
down, although at that time (two weeks old) pin feathers were appearing
in places. The chicks looked rather reptilian. Their eyes were not yet open.
The chicks were placed on a layer of wood shavings covered with kitchen-
roll paper, put in a cut-down ice-cream tub. This was placed in our incuba-
tor, set at &amp;apos;93*F * (33.9*C). To simulate the darkness inside the log, a cloth
was put over the lid of the incubator.
We (Simon Hunt, the other keeper, and I) decided that although the

parents would give the young some animal protein, their main diet would
be fruit. The diet would be the same as we give to touraco chicks, but with
the addition of Beef and Bone Broth baby food.
The diet consisted of:

3 teaspoons Cow and Gate Fruit Delight baby food

This was aU mixed together with a few drops of water and fed to the
chicks through a small syringe, with rubber valve tubing attached to the
nozzle. They were fed every 1 Yl hrs, with only small quantities of food, i.e.
V/i-2 mis, which they took readily.
The following notes come from our breeding records made at the time:
2nd July: The chicks seem to be doing fine. They were fed every two
hours throughout the night and are now being fed every two hours
through the day. One chick is slightly larger than the other - they weigh
84g and 76g. When they are fed they take a small quantity of food, swallow
it and then lick around the edges of their beaks with their reptile-like
tongues, only then will they take more food. Feeding, therefore, is a very
laborious task.
When the lid of the incubator is removed at feeding time, they respond
immediately by gaping violently and, if a finger is offered, will lunge up-
wards and take a good half of it down their throat. We have noticed that
they appear to have no crop, at least not a visible one. Therefore, we have
no visual means of knowing when they have had enough food. This does
not appear to be an immediate problem, because as soon as they have had
enough they flatly refuse any more.
3rd July: Both chicks appear alright. Both weigh 79g, therefore the
larger one has lost 5g; however, he looks quite healthy. When the chicks
are sleeping, they sit with their heads thrown backwards over their back.
They have pads on their 'hocks' which they use when feeding, probably
to make themselves more upright in the nest, and they will sit back on
them.
4th July: The smaller of the two chicks is not gaping properly; we
are having to force-feed it. Its weight has dropped from 79g to 64g. The
other chick's weight has increased to 82g.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9812815">
5th July: The smaller chick would not swallow food and died this
morning. The other seems fine.
6th July: The remaining chick's pin feathers are growing longer.
7th July: Its eyes are beginning to open slightly and its pin feathers

are definitely protruding more. Its breathing seems a bit heavier than
usual and it is sneezing occasionally. However, there is nothing wrong
with its appetite and it is now being fed about 12ml of food every two
hours. The incubator temperature is now 92*F (33.3*C).

8th July: The chick was seen preening its breast. Its breathing remains
heavy and it is sneezing still. We decided to give it a course of Rovamycin
(antibiotic), a pinch of which was put into one of its feeds.
10th July: Treatment continuing.
11th July: Exercising its wings. Feathers are now opening at the ends
of the quills.
13th July: Small, red worms found in its droppings. They are iden-

tified as belonging to the genus Cyathostoma , which apparently are very
similar to Syngamus (gapeworm) and have not been reported in toucans
or toucanets. All the symptoms, sneezing, heavy breathing, gaping, etc.,
which we believed to be a chill, apply also to this worm infection. We
treated the chick with Nilverm. The bird weighs 114g, so we gave it 1.1ml
(lml per lOOg). There has been no loss of appetite.
14th July: Not much change in its condition. From looking at it, the
bird does not appear to be critical. Saw it stretching and scratching its
head with its foot. Found one worm in its droppings.
15th July: He seems very active. We have not found any more worms.
20th July: The feathers on the wings are doing very well; they are
almost completely open. The head too is almost completely covered,
although the quills are still evident. The back is now covered in long quills,
as is the front.
24th July: We may soon stop weighing him, as this seems to cause a
great deal of stress.
26th July: No further weight recordings will be taken. The incubator
is now at its lowest setting, i.e. approximately 88*F (31.1*C). We will
lower this by raising the lid. Solid food, including diced bananas, grapes,
peaches, and raisins, as well as the mix, are now being fed to the bird.
28th July: During the day we switched off the incubator, without
the bird showing any apparent ill effects. We will switch it on again at
night, in case it suddenly turns cold.
29th July: More worms have been found in the chick's droppings.
We collected some fresh wormer, as the other was about a year old and
may not be as effective as it could be. This morning the chick looked very
ill before it was wormed, but had perked up considerably by this evening.

and breast are about half open. Now it really looks like a toucanet.

beak is discarded.
3rd August: The chick really seems to like it in the cage. He seems to
enjoy it so much that we have decided to leave him in it overnight.
4th August: The chick is constantly hungry and whenever it sees one
of us, it starts croaking. 1 feel that it is heavily imprinted and may be no
use for breeding purposes.
11th August: All its feathers have opened fully. It is now green all over
and its beak has begun to change from black to chestnut, though at the
moment this is only slightly noticeable. Its tail is still quite short, probably
about an inch long.
15th August: Will now eat food placed in its beak. It will toss the food
about until it has manoeuvred it into the correct position, then with a few
violent head jerking movements, will swallow the food.
17th August: A film crew came and I took the chick up to the centre
lawn to be filmed. It was a very hot day. While we were outside the chick
spent the whole time (about half an hour) sunbathing, which we thought
was very good, as he had never before been out in the sun. However, about
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.8769495" page_id="56240942"  page_num="188" year="" vol="">
an hour after being returned to his cage, he began having fits. He looked
very ill and as though at any moment he might die. After consulting
Amall and Keymer (1975), we decided that he must be suffering from
heat stroke. In an effort to bring down his temperature, we began spray-
ing him with cold water. We did this regularly. By evening he seemed to
have perked up a little and was again taking food. At about 7.30 p.m., he
had another fit but after being sprayed, soon settled down.
18th August: We continue to spray him every now and again. He
seems a lot better.
23rd August: Seems fine again. We hold a bowl of mixed fruit in
front of him and if we wait long enough, he will begin to pick up pieces
and eat them. His interest though, is soon lost, so we are coming in more
often in an effort to get him feeding himself.
25th August: We are now putting him out into a shed during the day
and bringing him in at night. He can fly quite well, back and forwards the
length (approximately 3m) of the shed. His lower mandible is developing
a white patch at the base and the rest of the beak is almost totally chest-
nut. We are going in to feed him every 1 Vi hrs.
31st August: Because he is so tame, whenever we go in, he flies on to
us. Left him all afternoon without a feeding and when we went in at
about 5.00 p.m., he had eaten the contents of a small bowl of fruit.
1st September: Fed him early in the morning before we put him out
and left him to his own devices for the rest of the day. He seems fine and
has eaten quite a lot of food. We are still bringing him in at night.

ing. He is doing very well and enjoys bathing.

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9950153" page_id="56240943"  page_num="189" year="" vol="">
With hindsight we believe that the male would have cared for the chicks
for he called incessantly and carried food to the nest log for several weeks
after the young were removed. However, as one chick was infected with
worms, we feel that it probably would not have survived, had it been left
with the male. A post mortem was not performed on the chick that died,
which may also have been infected with worms. We are reasonably sure
that the source of this infection was snails given to the adults, as snails
would carry the worm eggs. Therefore, it seems as though we probably
made the correct decision, for at least we managed to rear one of the two
chicks.

BREEDING AND BEHAVIOUR OF THE
BLUE AND WHITE FLYCATCHER Cyanoptila cyanomelana

Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.948868419354839" page_id="56240944"  page_num="190" year="" vol="">
This beautiful Old World flycatcher has occasionally been listed in
Ficedula or Muscicapa by some taxonomists. Walters (1980) merged the
monotypic Cyanoptila and Ficedula into Muscicapa. He comments that
the arrangement of the family is complicated, and that no authoritative
list exists.
For some years I considered cyanomelana as a breeding prospect;
attracted by their elegance, activity and, an advantage to the aviculturist,
their sexual dimorphism. In June 1986 I was able to purchase a pair in
good condition, and consulted the somewhat limited avicultural litera-
ture on the family.
Description
Approximately 7 in (0.18m). Male: bill black; irides dark brown;
crown cobalt blue; mantle, rump and upper tail-coverts dark blue, lightly
marked with black streaks; sides of head, throat and breast black; rest of
underparts white; legs and feet dark grey.
Female: Bill black; irides dark brown; upperparts greyish olive brown;
underparts greyish brown; throat, centre of breast and abdomen dull
white; undertail-coverts white; legs and feet dark grey.
Distribution and habitat
North and eastern Asia, southern Burma and Thailand, Philippine
Islands, Borneo, Japan. Mixed and deciduous forest, rocky areas, often
near streams.
Housing, food and feeding
Between April and November the birds are housed in an aviary (No. 1)
measuring 3.1 x 1.1 x 2.4m high (10 x 3.5 x 8 ft high). During the winter
they are housed in an outside bird room, maintained at a temperature
range of 8-12*C (45-55*F) with an extended day, provided by electric
light until 20.00 hrs. The basic diet consists of Claus softbill mixtures
(fine grade and coarse), mealworms and mealworm beetles. When breeding
this was supplemented with house crickets dusted with Vionate and live
food collected from nettle beds and bushes.

The adult birds readily ate the dried fruit in the coarse omnivorous
softbill mixture, beside the mealworm beetles. It is interesting to note
that Smythies (1981) records that cyanomelana specimens collected in
Borneo were found to have been feeding on berries, often green and hard.
Beetles and bees were found fairly often. Smythies comments that they
were seldom mixed with vegetable matter; specimens collected on the
same day and from the same habitat, had taken either 100% plant or
animal food.
Breeding
The adult pair was released into aviary No. 1 at the end of June 1986.
They had a moult in mid-July. Their moult was completed by early
August, both birds were very fit and they were returned to the bird room
in November. In April 1987 they were released into the same aviary which
had nesting receptacles among the cut conifer branches fixed to the sides.
These included a wooden box with a half-open front, of the type used for
Pied Flycatchers, fixed about 2m (6.5ft) above the ground. In June the
female began to take dried grass stems and upholsterer's fibres to the box,
and a nest of stems lined with fibres was completed. During this period,
the male followed the female in rapid flights, sometimes touching her
rump in flight. The female sat in the nest for brief periods during the day,
but eggs were not laid and there was no further breeding activity in 1987.
The pair was returned to the bird room in November.
First brood
In April 1988 they were released into the same aviary. On 3rd May the
female was taking stems and fibres to the nest-box. The nest was comple-
ted within three days and both birds were flying around the aviary, the
male chasing the female. The first of four eggs was laid on 8th May; the
female began incubating on 11th May when the last egg was laid. The
female was a close sitter, only coming off the nest to feed. The eggs were
of a white ground colour, sparsely spotted, with pale reddish brown most-
ly at the larger end. On 23rd May, four chicks hatched; they were pink
skinned with sparse grey down, the gape was a reddish pink, the gape
flanges pale creamy white.
The female brooded the chicks closely for the first six days during this
period, the male being largely responsible for feeding the chicks. The female
fed the chicks when she came off the nest to drink or bathe. The chicks
were fed on collected live food, caterpillars, moths and other flying insects,
and beetles. The parents always fed this before feeding the mini mealworms,
crickets and other commercially bred live food. The parents did not feed any
softfood to the chicks, or eat any themselves, once the chicks had hatched.

The faecal sacs were removed by both parents and eaten.
The chicks left the nest on 5th June; they could fly up to perches and
around the aviary. Their secondaries and primaries were nearly fully
developed, although their tails were rudimentary. Their bills were greyish,
with the gape flanges still pale creamy white at the base; the hides dark
brown. The upperparts were brownish grey with spots of dark brown and
yellowish buff, the secondaries and primaries were dark brown.
Second brood
On 6th June, the female repaired the same nest, and the first egg of
the second clutch of four eggs was laid on 7th June. The female began
incubation on the 10th, when the last egg was laid. On 12th June one
chick of the first brood, which was noticeably smaller than its siblings,
was found dead. The other three chicks thrived and were flying fast
around the aviary. On the 18th they were seen feeding themselves. At
this stage two of the chicks were showing a blue area on their tails, and
black edges to feathers on the secondaries and primaries, also white lower
abdomen and undertail-coverts. The third chick did not show these plu-
mage changes except for the white areas.
On 21st June the chicks of the first brood were removed from the
aviary to a bird room, and four chicks of the second brood hatched. They
showed the same pattern of development as the first brood and left the
nest on 4th July. Like the first brood, they could fly up to the perches
on leaving the nest; two of the chicks were slightly smaller than their
siblings. On 5th July the female was taking material to the same nest, and
on 9th July the first of four eggs (third clutch) was laid; the female began
incubating on 12th July when the last egg was laid.
By 16th July, the second brood were feeding themselves, their tails
were nearly fully developed and they were showing white on the under-
tail-coverts. The three chicks of the first brood could now be sexed visually,
the two males showing blue feathers on the secondaries, primaries and
tail. The breast and lower abdomen of all three chicks were now pale
greyish white. They had now been 'meated off a continuous diet of
live food on to commercial soft food. It is often overlooked that the
young of insectivorous birds reared in captivity have to become accus-
tomed to inanimate food, as did their imported parents.
Behaviour and voice
As in many species in the Muscicapidae , the song of the male is a
low-toned series of warbling notes, inaudible at any distance. A tic-tic
note is always accompanied by the tail being flicked up and down, often
occurring when they are given live food, or if there is any disturbance.

When a cat is sighted, both adults give a high pitched, four-note call until
the cat is out of vision. The food-soliciting call of the chicks, zeep-zeep-
zeep , could be heard from about 10 days after hatching.
Courtship flights around the aviary were performed with amazing speed
and timing in such a small area. The male would often twist down in a
loop, when almost touching the roof. On one occasion the male was chasing
the female, who alighted on the ground, turning to face the male as he
landed near her. He swung his head from side to side, singing and flirting
his wings and tail, the female flew up to a perch, the male following, and
copulation took place. Although they hawked for flying insects, they
would often take live food from the ground. Nesting material was always
taken from the ground, although it was available from various sites and
heights in the aviary. As with other species in the family, the adults were
very tolerant of nest inspection at all stages of reproduction.

The Cobalt-winged Parrakeet is mainly green in colour, almost irri-
descent on the back of the head and nape. The forehead is yellow which
seems to be brighter and more extensive in the cocks. The crown is tinged
with blue, again more so in the cocks. The bill is horn-coloured, and
there is an orange chin spot. The primary and secondary feathers are
bright cobalt blue and these give the birds their name, although little of
this blue can be seen when the wings are folded.
There are three subspecies: the nominate Brotogeris cyanoptera
cyanoptera , to which my birds belong, has the largest distribution, being
found in Brazil, southern Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador and eastern
Peru. B.c. gustavi differs in having the edge of the wing yellow and slightly
less blue on the wing; this is only found in a small area of northern Peru.
The other subspecies B. c. beniensis resembles gustavi but is found only in
northern Bolivia.
I purchased my original pair from a local pet shop, and installed them
in a 2 x 1 x 2m high indoor aviary. They were in quite good condition
considering that they had been fed a very sparse diet of sunflower seed
and the occasional grape. This was in 1981 but it was not until 1985 that
I saw this species for sale again, in the shape of four hand-reared chicks
bred by Mr. and Mrs. P. Clark. These were the first to be bred in Britain
(Avicultural Magazine , Vol. 92, No. 3: 124). I kept them separate from
my adult pair in a cage 4 x 2ft square (1.22 x 0.61m square) although they
were let out to fly around the birdroom whilst I was feeding the other
birds. By replacing their replenished food dish it was a simple matter to get
them to return to their cage.
The following year (1986) I obtained another three young birds from
the same source and all nine birds were placed in an indoor flight 2 x 1 x
2m high, in my new birdroom. After some initial bickering, all the birds
got on well together. Five nest-boxes were in place before they were
installed: two measured 7m square by 12in high (0.14m square x 0.24m
high) and the other three were SVim square by 10 in high (0.14m square x
0.25m high). All the boxes were at the same height and all had 2 in (0.04m)
entrance holes. After two weeks, eight of the nine birds were roosting in
one box, only the original cock staying out. In the five years in which I
had the original pair on their own, the cock never once entered a nest-box.

On 15th March 1987, mating was observed between one of the 1985
cocks and the original hen. On 20th March she laid her first egg in one of
the larger boxes. She then laid an egg every other day and started incubat-
ing from the second egg. The nest was inspected on 29th March as the hen
was out. The box contained five cold eggs so they were removed to an
incubator. After 10 days in the incubator, the eggs were candled to reveal
four fertile eggs and one clear one. On the 14th day of incubation we had
a power failure and the four eggs failed to hatch.
By the middle of May the same pair were seen mating and feeding each
other, but the same cock was also seen to be feeding and mating with one
of his sisters. On the 29th the original hen had laid an egg. Two days later
she laid her second egg, and the young hen laid her first in an adjacent
box. Both hens were sitting by 2nd June but the next day the young hen
was seen leaving the older hen's box. By the 5th I realised that both hens
were sitting in the same box. The two eggs laid by the young hen in her
own box were removed to an incubator but proved to be infertile. Mean-
while, the two hens continued to sit together on six eggs. Nest inspection
on the 29th revealed two chicks and a third hatched the next day. The
other three eggs failed to hatch and were removed; one was dead in shell
and the other two were clear. On 14th July I ringed the two younger
chicks, the oldest chick being too large to fit the size 'N' ring. Everything
went well with both hens and the cock feeding the chicks, and on 16th
August, approximately seven weeks after hatching, the first chick left
the nest-box, the other two followed the next day. After the three chicks
had left the box, the colony became very noisy with the three parents
becoming aggressive towards the original cock, so he was removed from
the aviary, although they did not show any aggression towards the other
inmates.
As the birds were kept indoors with extended daylight, they started
their second round in December. Two young hens sharing one box laid
a total of 12 eggs, none of which hatched, four being 'dead in shell',
three were addled and five were clear.
Meanwhile, the original hen had laid five eggs, all of which hatched, the
first on 18th January, and the others hatching within two days. All went
well for the next ten days until nest inspection on 2nd February revealed
what appeared to be a massacre. The chicks were cold and spread around
the box the inside of which was covered in blood. The chicks were covered
in bites and all showed severe bruising. The five chicks were removed and
placed in an incubator; the two youngest died within the hour but the
other three were hand-reared.
By April the same hen was again on five eggs although only two
hatched, two being 'dead in shell' and one clear. These two chicks were

BREEDING THE EUROPEAN GREY OR COMMON CRANE
Grus grus grus
AT STAGSDEN BIRD GARDENS (Bedford)
By RODNEY RAYMENT
(Owner)

<bodyText confidence="0.998710826086957" page_id="56240952"  page_num="198" year="" vol="">
In the spring of 1983, whilst visiting a local dealer, 1 noticed a particu-
larly fine specimen of European Grey, or Common Crane which was
calling continuously and looked very fit. The bird was then thought to be
a male, but later turned out to be a female and had, apparently, originally
been in a private collection in Buckinghamshire. After some negotiation, I
managed to acquire the crane, in exchange for some other birds. I already
knew of another single bird of the same species which I acquired, again in
exchange for other birds.
The new arrivals were introduced into a large pen, approximately
10,000 square feet in area, with a shallow pool and some trees for shade.
At this stage the birds were unsexed, but as they got on well together
and duetted when calling (which is a good indication of a true pair of
cranes) we decided to stick with what we had and not have them surgically
sexed. The male, however, was surgically pinioned. There are so few rep-
resentatives of this species of crane in this country that it would be unlikely
that we would be able to exchange one, should they prove to be of the
same sex.
No breeding activity was observed during the summer of 1983, al-
though they often danced in display and called together. The male went
through a heavy moult. During the spring of 1984, the intensity of calling
and dancing increased and whilst thus engaged they often picked up pieces
of grasses and tossed them up in the air. Early in May, I heard some softer
calls coming from the pen and on investigation, saw the female crouching

for the male to mate with her, which he did, apparently quite successfully,
thus disproving the theory that pinioned cranes cannot mate. On 26th
May a large light brown egg, with dark brown blotches, about the size of
a goose egg, was discovered next to the gate, at the front of the pen. There
was no nest, except for a few pieces of grass. The female sat on the egg
but left it if disturbed, both birds keeping a watchful eye on it from a dis-
tance. Two days later, on 28th May, a second egg was laid and as the nest
site was liable to disturbance, being in the front of the pen, close to where
visitors walked, it was decided to remove the eggs and place them under a
broody bantam.
Courtship activity continued and mating was again observed. Exactly
two weeks from the laying of the first egg, another egg was laid, this
time in a far comer of the pen. Some sticks and grass had been gathered
as an attempt at a nest. Two days later a second egg was laid. As the par-
ents were very protective and sat well, it was decided to leave the eggs with
them. The female sat most of the time but if she left the nest, the male
took over. He was particularly aggressive and continually patrolled the
perimeter of the pen, chasing away any other birds that came near. He
was particularly aggressive towards peafowl and finally killed one bird,
which was stupid enough to enter the pen.
Due to the dense nature of the eggshells, we could not candle the eggs
to see if they were fertile, although it believe it is possible with a very
strong light. However, the first clutch, under the bantam, looked promis-
ing and on 23rd June, after 28 days' incubation, the first egg to be laid
was pipped. We anticipated a prolonged hatching and left the egg, under
the bantam, until later on in the morning. However, as so often happens
when breeding birds, at the moment of success disaster strikes and on
inspection it was discovered that the chick had hatched and been killed
by the bantam. This is one of the risks incurred by using bantam foster
mothers instead of incubators, but overall I believe better results are
obtained using the former. Careful selection of breeding stock can elimi-
nate this trait. To avoid a repeat performance, the second egg was placed
in a still-air hatching incubator set at 90*F. It was pipped the next day.
After 24 hours it had made no further progress and so we decided to
help it out of the egg by carefully chipping away pieces of shell and
easing the chick's head out. This is a very delicate procedure and if done
before the membranes are dry, can result in the chick bleeding to death.
Also the chick must not be removed from the egg until the yolk sac is
fully retracted.
After removal from the egg, the chick developed splayed legs - this
sometimes occurs when hatching is delayed. To rectify this the legs were
tied loosely together with fine string, which enabled the chick to stand

and after two days the string was removed and the chick walked normally.
It readily took chick-rearing crumbs from a moistened finger and was
also given pieces of meat from day-old chicks. Its favourite was a 'clover
cocktail' comprising of moistened chick crumbs, mixed with chopped
clover and chick meat. After two or three days it picked up food itself and
began to grow rapidly.
After seven days the young crane was pinioned. He was a delightful
character, covered in ginger-coloured down, and he called excitedly on
seeing his keeper, who continued to hand-feed him with the 'clover cock-
tails' to supplement his diet of chick crumbs. Because of his leg problems
he was christened 'Crazylegs' and was the most appealing young bird
we have ever hatched. At ten days he was allowed out on fine days and
he would follow his keeper everywhere. We felt that it was important
that he should have plenty of exercise in order to strengthen his legs, as
in the wild he would walk considerable distances each day following his
parents. Young hand-reared cranes often develop leg problems, which
may be partly due to lack of exercise.
Meanwhile, the second clutch was still being incubated by the parents
and after 28 days the first egg pipped and hatched very quickly, as did the
first egg of the first clutch. We would have liked to have left it with the
parents to rear, but felt it was too vulnerable and as the second egg had
not yet pipped, the chick was removed for hand-rearing. He was much
stronger than 'Crazylegs', stood up after 24 hours and started to feed
himself immediately. The second egg pipped, but was slow to hatch,
the female kept standing up and fussing over it, probably helping the
chick out of the egg. When it finally emerged, we removed it for hand-
rearing. As young cranes have a tendency to cainism (i.e. the stronger
chick usually kills the weaker) they have to be kept separated for some
time. If allowed to be together they fought savagely. On one occasion
they accidentally got in together and the stronger chick badly pecked
the head of the other but fortunately it recovered. The three young cranes
consumed large quantities of rearing pellets, growing rapidly and gradually
replacing their ginger down with grey feathers. At this stage they lived
together quite happily. By September they were almost fully grown and
were left outside at night. In a natural state they need to grow fast and
achieve adult size by the end of the summer in order to be strong enough
to migrate to their winter quarters with their parents. They still retained
their juvenile cheeping calls until the spring, when their voices gradually
broke and deeper bugling calls were included in their repertoire. The last
of the ginger juvenile feathers on their heads were replaced with the
familiar black and white head pattern and red patches began to appear on
their bare, black crowns. At twelve months they were surgically sexed;

'Crazylegs', who was the larger, proved to be a male and the two from the
second clutch were both females. These birds will probably be retained for
future breeding stock.
We were successful again in rearing two young in 1985 and after our
success in breeding East African Crowned Cranes, in 1984 and 1985, we
are all very enthusiastic about cranes here at Stagsden and hope to estab-
lish breeding pairs of other species of cranes in the future.
This small family of birds, represented by 15 species, has very ancient
origins but is now very threatened. As cranes require large tracts of undis-
turbed open country in which to breed and migrate long distances to their
wintering grounds, they are very vulnerable and several species are now
very rare. As cranes are comparatively easy to manage in captivity and
breed quite readily, given the right conditions, it is very important to
establish captive-bred stocks of these birds, so that if their breeding
grounds were ever destroyed, they could be saved from extinction and
possibly reintroduced, when conditions were favourable. It would be
irresponsible if we were ever to allow these magnificent birds to disap-
pear, so that future generations were unable to hear their strident bugling
echoing across the last remnants of wilderness on our planet.

THE ORANGE-BELLIED PARRAKEET

Neophema chrysogaster
By PROFESSOR J.R. HODGES
(Harrow, Middlesex)
The Orange-bellied Parrakeet is the rarest species of the genus Neo-
phema and is probably very close to extinction. It has not been common
since the beginning of this century and it is estimated that now there are
less than two hundred individuals surviving. Orange-bellied Parrakeets
breed from November to February in the coastal areas of south-western
Tasmania. In March they commence their migration along the Tasmanian
west coast to King Island in the Bass Straits, where they appear to con-
gregate for a while before moving on to their overwintering habitat along
the coast of south-western Victoria.
Loss of habitat is probably the main cause of the decline of this spe-
cies for, although it breeds in one of the most inaccessible and uninhabited
regions of Tasmania, it spends the winters in an area on which there is
considerable pressure for industrial development.
Trapping for aviculture is also considered to be a reason for its near
extinction. Although the species has been totally protected for many
years, I saw several specimens in private aviaries in Adelaide in 1973 when
Fred Lewitzka, who was then head keeper of birds at Adelaide Zoo, told
me that he had pairs which were breeding in the aviaries at his home.
Presumably the wildlife authorities became aware of those activities and,
perhaps unwisely, insisted that the breeding stock should be released into
the winter habitat.
During the Australian parrakeet 'boom' in the last decade several spe-
cimens reached Europe. They were bred successfully on one occasion each
by two Dutch breeders but European aviculture has certainly done nothing
to help with the conservation of this species.
In 1984 an attempt to save the Orange-bellied Parrakeet from certain
extinction was initiated with the establishment of a 'recovery team' con-
sisting of representatives of the Tasmanian and South Australian National
Parks and Wildlife Services and the Royal Australasian Ornithologists
Union. Plans have been devised for the protection of the breeding areas in
Tasmania, the migratory route in Tasmania and King Island and the
wintering areas in Victoria. One of the Wildlife Officers responsible for the
implementation of the campaign in Tasmania is Peter Brown who, until he
emigrated to Tasmania, was in charge of the Bird Gardens at Harewood
House, near Leeds, and was a member of the Council of the Avicultural

Society. Although in recent years he has developed reservations about
the ethics of aviculture and the part which it can play in conservation,
his ambivalence has not prevented him from persuading the Tasmanian
authorities to embark on a captive breeding programme. It Is hoped to
establish ten breeding pairs of Orange-bellied Parrakeets and it is inten-
ded to liberate their young birds at the appropriate time into the right
environment.
Three years ago Peter took me to see the then newly established
aviaries. They consisted of several well-sheltered compartments, each
about 20 x 20 x 7 ft high (6.09 x 6.09 x 2.13m), with an elaborate, well
designed service corridor. As a pilot experiment, each compartment
contained four or five pairs of Blue-winged Parrakeets N. chrysostorna or a
similar number of Rock Parrakeets#. petrophila. In their first season both
species had produced between 20 and 30 young. These were to be used for
the main object of the exercise which was to determine the optimal
conditions for transfer to their natural habitat.
Having kept Blue-winged Grass Parrakeets in my aviaries for more than
20 years, during which my birds produced more than 200 young, I was not
surprised that the Tasmanian captive stock was breeding so well. However,
I could not disguise my excitement and surprise about the remarkable
breeding success with the Rock Grass Parrakeet for this has been one of
my favourite species ever since I had the good luck to obtain three about
20 years ago. Although they are duller coloured than the other members
of the genus Neophema , they are the largest and boldest. Far from being
Tat and sluggish' and &quot;dull and uninteresting', as Lendon and Boosey
described them, mine were active, lively and tame. The Rock Grass Parra-
keet has bred successfully on a few occasions in aviaries in Australia but
never, as far as 1 know, in Europe. In its natural habitat, along the coast
of South Australia, It feeds on the seeds of grasses and, particularly, mes-
embryanthemum and it nests in rock crevices. In captivity it adapts
quickly to an unnatural diet of 'parrakeet mixture' and nests in boxes.
Although those in the Tasmanian aviaries were provided with rockeries,
logs and conventional nest-boxes they seemed to prefer the boxes. Both
the Rock Parrakeets and the Blue-wings continued, apparently, to breed
consistently well in. the aviaries of the Tasmanian Wildlife Division and
their remarkable breeding success is attributed to the fact that they are
kept in colonies rather than as separate pairs per aviary as is usual.
I went again with Peter Brown to the aviaries when 1 was in Hobart
in March of this year (1988). The Blue-winged Parrakeets had been released
and in their place were about 20 Orange-bellied Parrakeets. This was the
first opportunity 1 had had to examine closely several of them together.
They are considerably larger than Blue-wings and In size and shape resemble

Rock Parrakeets. The upper parts are a lovely rich grass-green which con-
trasts with the yellow of the chest and breast. The orange patch on the ab-
domen is much brighter and more well-defined than that often seen in
Blue-winged or Elegant N. elegans Parrakeets. The birds were very active
and quite tame.
Four young birds had been reared in 1986/87 and ten in 1987/88.
However, it is not exactly a success story because the first young birds
developed beak and feather syndrome and died. This syndrome, which
may be identical with French moult, is caused by a viral infection which
is normally transmitted to the young in the nest by the parents which may
carry the disease without exhibiting any symptoms. Peter Brown, with the
co-operation of the School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Western
Australia, has been able to identify the birds carrying the disease. These
have been isolated. For the time being, they will be encouraged to go to
nest but their eggs will be placed under Rock Parrakeets which should
make good foster parents of disease-free young. The uninfected birds will
be allowed to rear their own young. It is hoped that eventually a disease-
free breeding strain will be produced.
The Tasmanian Wildlife Services made extraordinary and ridiculous
efforts to shroud in secrecy their resort to aviculture to help to save the
species. However, the secret was revealed when three birds were stolen.
Rumours were rife that the birds had been taken by an international
parrot smuggling ring and would end up in the collection of a wealthy,
uncaring American or European prepared to pay exorbitant sums for
them. However, the thieves were caught and turned out to be a couple of
local lads who thought their loot was a few budgerigars!
It will be interesting to see if aviculture will play a part in saving the
Orange-bellied Parrakeet from extinction. The re-establishment of the
species in the wild appears to present almost insurmountable problems
since so much of the overwintering habitat is threatened by commercial
interests. I believe that the efforts will be worthwhile if they succeed
only in the establishment of an aviary-breeding strain of this lovely little
bird - a view which, sadly, few conservationists will share.

The Crested Pigeon or Crested Bronzewing is one of the Australian
bronzewings. With the exception of the Common Bronzewing Phaps chal-
coptera about which I wrote previously in our magazine, it is the most
widespread and beautiful of them. Although its plumage is not, in my
view, quite so lovely as that of the Common Bronzewing, it is still very
beautiful and the Crested Pigeon is the most elegant of all the bronzewings
in shape and in its lively yet graceful movements and postures. Though not
so widespread as the Common Bronzewing it is usually more numerous,
and certainly more easily observed, where it does occur.
In size it is somewhat larger than a Barbary Dove Streptopelia roseo-
grisea but smaller than all but the tiniest Domestic Pigeons (African Owls
and Short-faced Almond Tumblers). It has, for a pigeon, a relatively slim
build with a rather long tail, medium-short wings, a small bill and a jaunty
Lapwing-like crest.
Its head is medium grey, its throat, breast and underparts pale grey.
The sides of the lower neck and upper breast are salmon pink. The upper-
parts are drab brown with a subdued bronze-green gloss. Most wing coverts
are strongly barred, each feather being pale purplish brown with a black
subterminal bar and a pale fawn tip. Those parts of the greater coverts and
inner secondaries that are visible when the wing is folded are, respectively,
iridescent green and iridescent purple, in each case the glossy part of
each feather being bordered with white. The primaries are dark greyish,
the third from outermost being very short and narrow and generally
thought to be responsible for the peculiar whistling rattle made when the
bird is in flight. The central tail feathers are dark drab, dully glossed with
green and with narrow white tips, the outer tail feathers are dark, glossed
with bluish, purplish or greenish and with broad white tips.
The eyes are orange, reddish orange, or yellow; the orbital skin pinkish
red as are the legs and feet, the bill is blackish, greyish at the base.
The sexes are alike, the juveniles are duller with only slight iridescences
in wings and tail.
In 'the field' at a little distance this pigeon looks an almost uniform
light grey and this general colour, combined with its distinctive flight and
longish tail at once identify it. The flight is partridge-like, consisting of
several rapid wing beats followed by long glides during which the wings

are held more or less horizontal (not downcurved like a partridge's). This
type of flight is shown by other species of the bronzewing group, Geo-
phaps and Petrophassa , which are much less arboreal than the Crested
Pigeon, suggesting that the latter, or rather its ancestors, may once have
been even more terrestrial in habit that it now is.
The Crested Pigeon is found throughout most of Australia except the
heavy rainfall areas and east of the Great Dividing Range. It inhabits
various types of more or less arid and (by European standards) fairly open
woodland, open arid country with some shrubs or trees and cultivated
areas provided there is some scrub or tree cover. It is never normally found
far from water and, like the Common Bronzewing, habitually uses artificial
sources of water such as dams and cattle troughs. It has increased its range
as a result of the opening up of dense woodland and provision of water
supplies by man but does not seem to have been able to adapt to urban or
suburban conditions, where the introduced feral pigeon, Spotted Dove
and Laughing Dove are the common members of this family.
The Crested Pigeon feeds and spends much of its time on the ground. It
feeds mostly on seeds, including those of various herbs and grasses and
mulga trees Acacia sp. The seeds of the weed Patterson's Curse Echium
lycopsis (formerly E. plantaginuem) is often a major food. Small bulbs,
leaves of trefoils and other greenstuff, small snails and other small inverte-
brates are also taken.
It has long been kept and bred with some success in captivity, yet not,
sad to say, sufficiently so to have become widespread and abundant in a
captive state, far less to have become domesticated as has its smaller com-
patriot the Diamond Dove Geopelia cuneata.
Many attempts to introduce it at liberty into Britain and other European
countries have been made but all have failed, nor has it been successfully in-
troduced elsewhere though this has been tried in Hawaii, New Zealand and
the USA (Lever, 1985). Nicolai found that the Crested Pigeons that he tried
to keep free flying in Germany were invariably killed sooner or later by Tawny
Owls. If I remember rightly, our former and much missed member the late
Duke of Bedford had similar experiences with this species and with Laugh-
ing Doves Streptopelia senegalensis when he tried to keep them at liberty.
Nicolai (1969) recommends that Crested Pigeons should be fed on
white millet, canary seed, maw seed, hemp, wheat, dari and greenfood. I
have no personal experience of keeping this bird but hope that some of
our members who have will give us further information.
Frith (1982) says that this species comes to water at all times of day
but possibly this is only when the water supply is conveniently near or the
birds not endangered when visiting it. Those Crested Pigeons that I was
able to watch, in 1965, at two different localities in inland South Australia,

mostly came to drink in the early morning, aboyit 30 to 60 minutes
after sunrise. A few, however, probably different birds, came in the
evening but while it was still light, before the Common Bronzewings
came to the water. Those Crested Pigeons that I watched usually showed
signs of fear when coming to drink. They usually arrived in pairs or small
parties and tended to sit about on trees near the water, while their num-
bers grew, uttering distress calls, until a bold individual, or an extra thirsty
one, flew down and began to drink when its example was at once fol-
lowed.
As they first put their bills to the water, many slightly tilted and spread
their tads, a flight intention movement. Those that were drinking from
natural water (Cooper's Creek) often waded in and drank with their
breast and belly in contact with the water but I never saw one bathe. All
those that came in the morning appeared to have empty crops and they
drank so deeply as to fill the crop with water as could clearly be seen from
the profiles of those leaving the water. I may say this was at a time and in
an area where it was very hot in the middle hours of the day.
When nervous at the proximity of a human being, wild Crested Pigeons
(I say 'wild' as I do not recall seeing the same behaviour from specimens
in zoos) repeatedly make a quick 'hitching up' movement of one wing.
This appears to involve a slight opening and lowering of the wing which is
then quickly flicked back to its normal position. This is seen in some other
pigeons as an apparent comfort movement but in the Crested Pigeon and
the Common Bronzewing it appears to be compulsive when there is
apparent conflict between fear and whatever impulse prompts the bird not
to fly further away.
The Crested Pigeon is usually seen in pairs or small parties but may
aggregate into flocks of up to about a thousand birds (possibly more but I
speak of what I have seen) in good feeding areas or near water in a dry
season.
In what is probably an escaping behaviour pattern, normally used in
reference to birds of prey, the Crested Pigeon flies at great speed to a
thickly foliaged tree or bush and plunges into it. This may, but rarely,
be done when the bird is disturbed by man, especially just before dusk.
Much more often, Crested Pigeons that I disturbed would fly down to and
perch on a bush or shrub and then make repeated movements in which
the head was lowered and the bird appeared to peer into the bush. These
gave the impression of being intention movements of entering and hiding
although if I then approached closer the bird would fly away.
Earlier in this article I have referred to the partridge-like flight of this
bird but had perhaps better add that when it is flying upwards the wings
are, as one would expect, beaten continuously, and when flying slowly

only one wing beat may intersperse the glides. It walks and runs rapidly.
The nest is built in a tree or bush, preferably a thick and prickly one
(Frith); it is the usual pigeon's nest of twigs and similar materials. Two
white eggs are laid. They may breed at any time of the year but least
often in winter (May to July).
The advertising coo sounds to my ears a soft, plaintive but rather
musical coo-oo or oo-roo, subject to some individual variation. Frith, on
the other hand, describes it as a quite loud, single note. The display coo
is short and grunting. The nest call is a soft, rapidly repeated double coo.
The distress call is a short, panting coo , more musical and less grunting
than that of many pigeons.
In the bowing display of the Crested Pigeon there is relatively little
inflation of the neck, or what there is is masked by the general erection
of the body plumage, the wings are partly opened and tilted frontally
and the tail raised and spread so that the irridescent areas on wings and
tail flash fully into view. There is also, at least when the display is given
at full intensity by a bird on the ground, a side-to-side rocking motion
caused by the displaying bird raising its feet alternately. In this display,
as in other sexual and aggressive contexts, the crest is laid flat or nearly
flat, although at other times it is kept erect.
The bowing display is given in threat or defiance as well as when
courting a female. Unlike some other pigeons in which the bowing dis-
play is used also in aggressive contexts, such as the Rock and Domestic
Pigeon Columba livid , and the Speckled Pigeon C. guinea , only the cock
Crested Pigeon {vide Nicolai) gives the bowing display which can, there-
fore be used by the aviculturist to sex his birds.
When nest-calling the Crested Pigeon's wing twitching consists of a
series of quick movements, then a pause of longer duration before the
next series of movements. A clear example of how, in this and many (per-
haps all?) pigeon species the wing movements given when nest calling
are in the same tempo as the usual wing movements in flight.
The display flight consists of flying up at a steep angle, loudly clapping
the wings and then gliding steeply down again, often in a half circle.
I have only once seen copulation in this species. The cock gave the
bowing display, the hen walked away from him, he followed still dis-
playing. She turned, ran to him in a crouching posture with lowered
crest, and reached her bill, with nibbling movements into his neck fea-
thers and over his neck while he was still in the act of bowing. She then
solicited, crouching with retracted neck like many (but not all) pigeons
do. The cock walked round her a few times with lowered crest, then
mounted and copulated. He dismounted in front of the hen, walked
a little way from her, then turned and each ran to the other in precisely

the same manner as the hen had previously done. With nibbling move-
ments they reached their bills towards each other's, bill-fenced, then allo-
preened each other's necks and then relaxed.
The line sketches are just to give some idea of the bird. They have no
pretensions to art or detailed accuracy. There are good drawings of dis-
plays and postures of this species in Frith's book.

Eight Abyssinian Ground Hornbills have been reared at the Dallas Zoo
using two of three established methods., parent-rearing and shared-rearing.
Growth and morphological changes were recorded for each chick and sup-
ported by information from the San Diego Wild Animal Park, (he Walter
D. Stone Memorial Zoo in Boston, and Abilene Zoological Gardens. From
this data, a comparison of growth rates and a characterisation of morpho-
logical development were achieved.
Rearing techniques
Three techniques have been successfully used in the rearing of Abys-
sinian Ground Hornbills. These are parent-rearing, shared-rearing (both
used at the Dallas Zoo), and hand-rearing. These methods allow captive
rearing under varying circumstances. To make comparisons in growth and
development, information was gathered throughout the nestling period.
Chicks in the nest or incubator were regularly weighed. Linear measure-
ments and photographs were also taken to document development.
In 1981 the Dallas Zoo's Abyssinian Ground Hornbills hatched and
reared their first chick. The birds were tolerant of human intrusion so
the chick was removed from the nest regularly for measurements and
inspection. The mother normally waited in the nest for her chick to be
returned. Four Hornbills have now been reared by their parents at the
Dallas Zoo.
Two chicks hatched five days apart in 1982. With such a difference
in age, it was likely that only one would survive without human inter-
vention. The older chick was removed and placed in a brooder for hand-
rearing. After a week, the older chick was replaced in the nest and the
younger one was removed. This process was repeated weekly until the
chicks fledged. With this method of shared-rearing, both chicks were
able to survive and both received contact with their parents.
Total hand-rearing has not been necessary at the Dallas Zoo but has
been accomplished elsewhere, allowing comparison of growth rates under
the three methods.

Growth and development
The incubation period for the Abyssinian Ground Hombill is about
38 days among captive birds. Emergence from the shell may require
two days from first pip. At hatching, the chick is pink and the pterylae
are evident, especially along the lower back and crown. The dark grey
beak is tipped with cream and the lower mandible is approximately 3mm
longer than the upper. The hatching weight for 16 chicks averaged 69.7g.
After an initial loss, the weight gain is rapid. Regular measurements
of morphological features (culmen, wing chord, tarsus, etc.) further
marks the fast rate of development.
The skin colour immediately begins to change and is dark purple by
the end of the first week. At this time, the eyes have begun to open and
the pterylae have become more defined. By two weeks, feathers are
erupting from their sheaths and feather growth accelerates rapidly. When
three weeks old, the eyes are fully open and the mandibles meet distally.
The chick is becoming well feathered, the eyelashes are prominent, and
the feet grip well. Weight gains average 75g per day from four to six
weeks, and begin to level off at seven weeks. Chicks exceed adult weight
before fledging at two to two-and-a-half months old. At this time, they
are capable of limited flight but frequently return to the nest.
Conclusion
Comparison with the model growth curve indicates that the different
rearing methods approximate normal growth. The shared-rearing method
allows both chicks to socialise with the parents during the nestling period.
This interaction promotes normal social growth and chicks reared in this
manner have become only mildly humanised, exhibiting normal beha-
vioural patterns. The calm nature of these captive-bred birds will, later,
facilitate the study of their offspring.
The continuing study of the Abyssinian Ground Hombill will lead to
a better understanding of its growth from development within the egg
through adulthood. This understanding will aid the management of this
species and possibly that of the other hornbill species as well.

There have been several cases of mistaken identity among species of
imported birds offered for sale recently, and it occurred to me that a
few notes on the subject might be helpful. The problem is manifest in
several ways, and the following list covers them all, I think.
1. Misiden tification at country of origin
The shippers of birds from, say, Tanzania or Peru are not usually
experts on what birds they are supplying. This might come as a surprise
to some readers but it is true. In recent years I have visited bird markets
in Latin America and all over Asia Pacific and have also visited shippers'
holding stations in many countries. I have found the professional shippers
to be varied in their knowledge of particular birds, usually quite expert in
their area of particular interest (which seems most often to be parrots), in
South-East Asia they are often reasonably knowledgeable in the case of
local softbills. Very seldom are they knowledgeable on seed-eaters, and
it is with seed-eaters that we find the most cases of mistaken identity.
2. Confusing country of shipment with country of origin
Birds fly around the world, in every sense! In a recent case of a mys-
terious 'yellow-billed seedeater' from Mexico, the confused dealer in this
country - believing the birds were of Mexican origin because they were
shipped from Mexico - identified them as something completely wrong.
There is no doubt that the birds came from Peru but the only way the
dealer could have known that is if he had been an expert on all Latin
American finches, or had referred to field guides of the birds from Colom-
bia and Peru. This problem is often encountered when birds are imported
from Hong Kong where shippers assemble their stock from all over the
South-East Asian region, or maybe even further afield than that.
3. Incorrect identification in quarantine
When birds come in under a collective name (i.e. bulbuls, firefinches,
buntings) or a catch-all like 'common seedeaters', it is incumbent upon
the importer to identify them. It is amazing how often it is extremely
difficult to identify some birds. I myself have sat for an hour or more in
a quarantine station, with two dozen books by my side, attempting to
identify some species or other.

Occasionally I am asked to visit a quarantine station to help with identi-
fication, On other occasions I am intrigued - or excited - by an unusual
name on a trade list or in an advertisement in Cage and Aviary Birds and
I will call the importer to get further details. I can only remember one in-
stance when I was totally stumped with a finch. The importer had received
a couple of dozen Sicalis from Peru, listed in the shipper's manifest as
Saffron Finches and Raimondi's Finches. The problem arose not from the
plumages, which suggested that they were all Saffron Finches S. flaveola
in juvenile and first year adult plumage (no full-coloured adults) but from
the sizes. The birds ranged in size from 5 in to 6 V 2 in (0.13 to 0.17m) in
length. Very reluctantly we decided that they were probably all S. flaveola
but from different parts of the western side of the Andes.
4. Incorrect identification by the retailer
This is where the problem usually impacts upon readers of Cage and
Aviary Birds , because it is in the advertising columns where the 'yellow-
billed seedeaters' and 'white-bellied manakins' appear - not to mention
the 'Giant Green Singing Finch' of recent dispute between two giants of
aviculture (Bryan Peck and Jeffrey Trollope).
My lifetime's passion is seedeating birds. I have kept finches since 1947
and have been interested in every aspect of them all my life. In 1972 I was
so concerned with the confusion between common names and the obvious
confusion it caused among aviculturists that I was moved to write a book
that covered every finch then known to aviculture, and every common
name given to each one. The index of common names was so comprehen-
sive that it extended to 20 pages. In researching the list I was struck by
the overlapping of English names, when different species are given the
same common name (Blue Grosbeak for Cyanocompsa cyanea and Guiraca
caerula, Masked Weaver for Ploceus intermedius and P. velatus are but
two examples). Nonetheless, some of the naming is quite misleading. By
and large I do not blame retailers. It is not right to say that they use over-
colourful or inflated names in order to push up the price (although some
undoubtedly have done so) because I have seen quite rare birds advertised
at very low prices on occasion.
A good example of misnaming is the 'Giant Green Singing Finch'. What
a pity the trade ever caught on to this one. Could it be that somebody
thought it would appeal to the baser showman's instinct - bigger is better?
The fact is that both Serinus sulphuratus (known alternatively as the
</bodyText>
<reference confidence="0.76160925">
Sulphur-coloured Seedeater, Brimstone Canary and Bully Seedeater)
and S. flaviventris (also known as the St. Helena Seedeater, Yellow Canary,
Yellow Seedeater, Yellow-billed Seedeater, and Marshall's Canary) have
been advertised as Giant Green Singing Finches. Could it be that the im-

porter or the retailer do not know which species it is, and thus are covering
themselves? It is always possible. There always has been confusion in
identifying serins, and nowadays there are many more species available
than ever before and it is almost impossible to have a library that will
enable you to identify all with certainty. My sketch shows the essential
difference between the three species in question (adult males).

All three of these serins are sometimes called Green Singing Finches
Earlier I referred to the Yellow-billed Seedeater. The retailer in ques-
tion had searched his two books on the birds of Mexico and, based on a
concise written description had decided that the birds were Sporophila
schistacea. This is a medium-size Sporophila that is found in northern
South and Central America, and an adult male in breeding condition does
in fact, have a yellow bill. However, the birds in question had brown under-
tail coverts (S. schistacea has white undertail coverts) and white patches on
the tail. Clearly these birds were not even Sporophila. I was able to identify
them as Catamenia analis , known as the Band-tailed Seedeater. The ship-
ment, typical of most from Mexico, contained only male birds which is
very sad because to my knowledge none of the Catamenias have ever been
bred in captivity, and in my experience with them, they settle in very well.

The final reason for misleading English names for birds in the advertis-
ing columns can only be explained by what I call the cloth-ears syndrome;
the person hearing the name misheard it, and wrote down something else.
How else can one explain the recently-advertised Silver Eared Messiah?
This is more obvious than most, and strictly speaking is more of a chal-
lenge to the sense of humour of the reader than a risk of serious misunder-
standing. However, when I referred to the 'White-bellied Manakin' earlier, I

was serious. I have been searching for the White-bellied Munia Lonchura
leucogastra for a couple of years now, anxious to compare it to other
allied species and none of the literature is very helpful in this. So every-
time I see it advertised I follow up carefully. The African munias are
usually referred to as mannikins, but a manakin is a very exotic little
bird of the family Pipridae 1 , nearer to a Cock-of-the-Rock than any finch.
The &amp;apos;White-bellied Manakin 5 turned out to be the Striated Munia Lon-
chura striata. Another species that Is occasionally imported, the Black-
ramped Munia L leucogasi.roides Is usually called the Striated Munia, a
classic case of innocent downgrading. The Black-ramped was little known
and had not been bred in Britain until last year and was surely worth
more than the commonly-imported L. striata which has been bred often.
In a recent article, Bryan Peck described the confusion between the
races of the Lined Finch Sporophiia L bouvronides and S. l lineoia. There
is a third species of black-and-white seedeater also imported from Peru, the
Black-and-White Seedeater S. luctuosa. I hope my sketch makes it: very
clear which is which.

Incidentally the bouvronides/lineola complex has never been studied
exhaustively, although Paul Schwarz probably did more field work on the
subject than anybody. His last set of field notes were impounded by the
government of Venezuela when he died and have not yet been studied by
a competent ornithologist. He concluded that the two were sibling species.
The S. luctuosa can be identified absolutely by the white crescent beneath
the eye - a diagnostic feature not shown in the books because it disappears
when the skins are preserved as museum specimens.
In the 15 years or so since writing my check list of common names, I
have lived in four different continents and have first hand experience of
very many more finches than I ever dreamed possible. In the four years
since returning to England I have seen an increase in the variety of finches
available, many of which were unknown outside the field guides only
a few years ago. I am working on a new check list based book but this will
be a couple of years in the making.
Meanwhile, if any reader has any favourite confusions among the
finches, I will be happy to discuss them and provide diagnostic illus-
trations for the benefit of all readers.

LEEDS CASTLE AVIARIES
A MEMORIAL TO LADY BAILLIE

As the many thousands of visitors to Leeds Castle will already know,
Lady Baillie, who bequeathed Leeds Castle to the Leeds Castle Founda-
tion on her death in 1974 was a very keen aviculturist. Although she
kept many species of parrots, softbills, finches and waterfowl, her main
interest lay in the Australian psittacines. These were housed in 140 very
long aviaries in the conventional construction of the 1950s and 60s, to-
gether with cockatoos and other large parrots. Lady Baillie was one of the
first to own the blue mutation of the Indian Ring-necked Parrakeet and
this species has been bred in the collection for a number of years. Austra-
lian King Parrots and other broad-tailed parrots, as well as Princess of
Wales' and other shaft-tailed parrots, and many species of Rosella such as
the Brown, were kept in the adjoining aviaries.
As the reader will realise, this collection was built up for the pleasure
and enjoyment of one person and although the aviaries remain adequate
for the birds to live and breed in, the access and walkways proved inade-
quate for the public. Plans were made to build new aviaries in line with
modern thinking, both from the public's viewpoint and the practical side
of bird management. The design of the aviaries themselves is quite unlike
any other in this country. No expense has been spared on the use of
construction materials so that the buildings will require minimum ser-
vicing in future years.
The main aviary structures were completed on 31st March and the
public was admitted on 3rd April 1987. since then these new aviaries have
received many compliments from the general public for their spectacular
design and beautiful setting in 500 acres of rolling parkland. Aviculturists
who enjoy species of rare and endangered birds have been very pleased
with this new facility.
The birds' welfare, both physical and mental, has been of paramount
importance in the design of the aviaries. Although the construction is
finished, the new bird garden's 48 purpose-built aviaries will continue to
evolve until the collection is well-balanced and productive. There is also
an area for large terrestrial birds, planted with trees and shrubs and with
a large pond with running water purified by a sophisticated filtration
system. Approximately one half of the aviaries have concrete floors
covered in large pebbles to facilitate easy cleaning and all debris can be

hosed down to a drain within each aviary. These flights have rock ponds
some of which are supplied with running water from miniature water-
falls. This is particularly important as many birds will bathe several times
a day if the water is inviting, which in turn leads to better breeding success
and improved feather condition. The pools can also be emptied from
outside using a valve which empties three or four aviaries at one time.
Nest-boxes and barrels are situated in most cases in the inside shelters.
This will not only protect the boxes from the elements but also provide
the dark environment that many of these birds, particularly the South
American stock, seem to prefer. The birds are fed from trays fitted to
the stable-type doors on each aviary shelter. This enables the keepers to
perform the daily routines from outside the flights via the inside service
hallways. The lighting in these shelters is connected to automatic dimmers
so that light levels can be adjusted to suit the birds' needs, particularly
during the winter months.
Breeding obviously comes very high on our list of priorities and we
are very aware that birds need to feel that their territory is secure without
the threat of encroachment in order to achieve any sort of breeding
success. There is a common theory that zoos do not breed birds well.
The new aviaries which are to house our softbills are over 15 ft (4.57m)
high and we are finding that this extra height gives the birds an added
feeling of security, as they can maintain their own flight distance from the
public if they feel the need. The upper reaches also provide an excellent
site for nest-boxes which the birds can use with no risk from predators.
Great care is taken in the preparation of the diet to ensure that all
the birds' nutritional requirements are met. The parrots are receiving
only a very small proportion of dry seed as the bulk of their diet is made
up of sprouted seeds, pulses and chopped fruit. We believe this diet
has proved itself as many of our birds have attempted breeding this year
and stock that had previously laid a two-egg clutch in the past has in-
creased this year to a three-egg clutch. The softbills are fed a wide range of
fruit and vegetables, care being taken to accommodate individual likes and
dislikes and at the same time not to feed any one item in excess.
The collection already includes many noteworthy species including
Palm, Red-vented and Leadbeater's Cockatoos; Hyacinthine, Red-fronted
and Scarlet Macaws; Keas; Violaceous Turacos, Royal Starlings, Banded
Aracaris, Crowned Plovers and other softbills. Our turacos are housed in
a large aviary supplied with many perches. This perching arrangement
allows the birds to demonstrate the unique natural behaviour displayed
by turacos, rapidly scurrying up and down branches. Their feet are equipped
with a third toe that can be pivoted to give a two-forward and two-back
or a three-forward and one-back arrangement to provide the bird with
the best possible control on any surface that it may perch on.

Care has also been taken in labelling the exhibits. Each graphic plate
consists of a high quality photograph taken by well-known wildlife photo-
grapher David Hosking. This photograph is accompanied by comprehensive
details of the range, habitat, habits and nesting. This information is con-
tained within a specially designed frame, thus making the finished product
attractive and informative.
All birds that are sexually mature have been supplied with nesting
facilities. All monomurphic species have been surgically sexed and com-
patible pairs installed in the aviaries to give us the best possible breeding
potential. During our first season in 1987 we did not expect to achieve
great breeding successes but were very pleased to have Scarlet Macaws,
Little Corella Cockatoos, Spreo Starlings, Port Lincoln, mutation Quaker
and Splendid Grass Parrakeets, Kakarikis and various Australian finches
surprise us with young, some even going down for a second clutch.
We have certainly tried to consider every eventuality. Should any of
the large parrot species prove unreliable as parents we are fully prepared
to hand-rear their young and this, of course, will encourage a second
clutch. With this in mind, the incubator room has been purpose-built
with all necessary support systems. The generator automatically cuts
in if power should fail and surge filters have been fitted to filter out all
spikes. An exhaust fan keeps the room fresh as the heater maintains con-
stant ambient temperature. This room is even hooked up to the alarm
system so the keepers are called at home by central station if all else fails.
Specially constructed forced air, thermostatically controlled brooders
await any chick that must be hand-reared.
On the educational side there will be 'behind the scenes' tours which
will incorporate the incubator, nursery, kitchen, hospital and holding
rooms. The kitchen is fully equipped and would make most housewives
envious. The utmost care is given to constructing diets for all of the birds
as this obviously plays a very important part in bringing the stock into
breeding condition.
As visitors stroll through the lovely wooded garden towards the Castle,
they come upon our duckery which is currently under extensive renova-
tion. This duckery contains many rare species of exotic waterfowl. A large
group of flamingos will be a focal point as our visitors enter this area,
followed by a breath-taking view of the Castle. The water flowing over
the beautiful cascade is diverted from the River Len, supplying fresh water
for the birds throughout the year. The duckery is teeming with large carp
eager to take a morsel from the visitor.
This collection will be in a constant state of change for the next year
or so as we find species that are best suited to our particular environ-
ments. We have no doubt that within that period, we will build a well-

balanced mixture of avifauna, including parrots, softbUls, and terrestrial
and arboreal birds. There is no doubt that this collection will grow to be
self-sustaining and contribute to the captive breeding pool of the birds
represented here.
Leeds Castle Foundation, a registered charity, is indebted to the indi-
viduals who contributed their time and expertise to this development.
Naturally at the top of this list is Lady Baillie to whom these aviaries are
dedicated. The collection she kept was interesting and varied, and many
aviculturists have fond memories of visiting Leeds Castle and its birds.
Many people assisted with the original planning of this new facility.
Raymond Sawyer has been a great friend and has helped all along the
way. We have certainly enjoyed his great sense of humour and his vast
knowledge of birds, plants and aviaries and how to present them properly.
Andrew Grant, the Managing Director of Leeds Castle, has directed all
of us in this endeavour to revive the collection and the history it represents.
Rosemary Low and Robert Grantham should be mentioned for assist-
ance in the original planning, together with James Dolan, General Curator
for San Diego Zoo, California. The architect, Vernon Gibberd has learned
a great deal about the keeping of birds and enough cannot be said Tor his
unique design.

A DISPLAY BY TRAINED BIRDS IN BEIJING, CHINA
By SIMON STIRRUP
(Cambridge)

<bodyText confidence="0.797256647058824" page_id="56240981"  page_num="227" year="" vol="">
On 10th November 1986 I witnessed a bird display at Taoranting Park
in the Xuanwu District of Beijing (Peking), China. The display area was
screened off and a small entry fee, about 2p, was charged. A variety of
passerines were tethered by their necks to perches located in a roped-off
corner. This method of attachment seemed to cause the birds distress as
many individuals spent much of their time pecking at the string and metal
leads. The species involved were: Mealy Redpoll Acanthis flammea, Siskin
Carduelis spinus, Red Crossbill Loxia curvirostra , Hawfinch Coccothraustes
coccothraustes, Japanese Grosbeak C personata and Oriental Greenfinch
Carduelis sinica. Caged, but not on display, were two Zebra Finches
Poephila guttata. The single Redpoll had a white feather fastened
to the back of its head to form a crest.
At intervals birds were removed from their perches and taken to a
roped-off display area. Here their tricks were accompanied by a mega-
phone-delivered commentary. The following displays were observed:
i) Removing pieces from a suspended paper lantern and flying with them
to owner's hand. Only performed by a Siskin;
ii) Catching perforated plastic ball rolled along ground and returning
with it. Performed by Oriental Greenfinch;
iii) Similar trick to above, except that ball caught in mid-air when thrown
vertically. Performed by Siskin;
iv) Small coins removed from the fingers of the audience and taken to
owner. Performed by Siskin and Crossbill;
v) Opening wooden box and extracting plastic items from inside. Per-
formed by male and female Crossbills.
As far as could be ascertained, all the birds, apart from one Crossbill,
were males.
In addition to the passerines, there were also three tethered Golden
Eagles Aquila chrysaetos and a Eurasian Sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus.
The Sparrowhawk was used to attract the audience into the display
area by being frequently taken outside sitting on a wrist. It was certainly
a very interesting experience and I must say that I was quite impressed
with the displays. It was good to see that all the birds were in good con-
dition.

THE HISTORY OF THE BIRDS OF BRITAIN

Illustrations by David Reid-Henry, text by Colin Harrison. Published by
Collins, London, in association with H.F. and G. Witherby. Price #14.95.
New books on British birds continually appear. Not all are good value
for money but this one most decidedly is.
The 48 colour plates and the numerous sketches of birds are by our
late member, Mr. David Reid-Henry (signs D.M. Henry). This, to all who
know his work, is sufficient guarantee of their excellence and beauty. The
foreword, by Albert Earl Gilbert, quotes from a letter by the artist in
which he expresses his regret at sometimes having to paint birds that he
has not seen and studied in life and his statement: 'Much that I did in ear-
lier days I can now fault,.'. Few others would, I imagine, venture to
find fault with any of David Reid-Henry's work though it is true that a few
of the paintings in this book are not so superlatively excellent as the
majority and give the impression that he may not, when he painted them,
have been familiar with the species in life; the Eider Duck struck me as an
example of this.
All in all, however, they have the combination of beauty and accuracy
of detail that we look for, and never fail to find, in this artist's work.
In his preface, fellow member Colin Harrison (happily still very much
with us) says: 'In writing this book I have tried to put the birds of Britain
into their long term context.' In this he has been entirely successful. I have
not only read and re-read the general discussion, which includes sections
on 'The Earliest History', 'The Pleistocene', 'Pleistocene Birds', 'The
Recent Period', 'Recent Birds', 'Man-modified Britain', 'The Twentieth
Century' and 'Final Comment', but also the sections dealing individually
with all the species illustrated and some, such as the Mandarin Duck,
that are not.
Out of so rich, yet so easily digestible a pudding it is hard to decide
which plums to pick out for quotation. How surprised and pleased I was
to learn (p. 14) that 600,000 years ago the Mandarin Duck was a member
of our avifauna. Let us hope this fact will be used in its defence against
those who object to all introductions on principle! As Dr. Harrison points
out, if the Azure-winged Magpie did not occur in Iberia, it too would have
been thought, as was the Mandarin Duck, to be a purely east Asiatic
species.

species. These and other identifications are, incidentally, based largely or
entirely on Dr Harrison's own detailed long term studies on fossil bird
bones.
The reader will find him- or herself constantly coming on interesting
and thought-provoking statements. For example: 'Since the early 1940s
there has been ....an enormously increased use of insecticides of all
kinds. These would appear to be reducing the availability of insects in
general, and possibly having a greater effect on larger insects with smaller
total populations.' (p. 20).
Most writers who touch on bird conservation attack egg collectors,
skin collectors, aviculturists and foreign peasants who kill birds for much
needed food but express their approval of 'legitimate sport' and its adher-
ents. I was delighted to see that Dr Harrison, on the contrary, makes no
bones about what sport has cost us in terms of wildlife (p. 23), though he
might perhaps have added that the timidity of so many British birds is
mainly or entirely due to them, or their recent forebears, having been so
much shot at.
Perhaps the most currently cogent section of the book is Dr. Harrison's
'Final Comment' (p. 25). Old fogies like myself, who recall freer times,
view with some disquiet the modern tendency to regard wild birds as
creatures found in reserves where entrance is often restricted to those
willing or able to pay for the privilege, and necessarily circumscribed.
Unlike many modem conservationists, Dr. Harrison is well aware of this
problem and truly says 'Things which are rightly or wrongly seen to be
available only to a privileged minority are hardly likely to be regarded as
the birthright of the population as a whole.'
I could go on quoting from this excellent book but will refrain. I
recommend it whole-heartedly to all who are interested in our wild birds,
their history and possible future, and to all who delight in beautiful
pictures of them.

The study involved the analysis of 1200 Barn Owl pellets, obtained
from a nest-site at Karen, a suburb of Nairobi. 4470 prey fragments were
recovered and 2262 prey items identified. These are listed in four tables
and there is a review of the genera and species identified and some com-

HABITS AND BREEDING BIOLOGY OF THE GREAT BLUE TURACO
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.970975315789474" page_id="56240984"  page_num="230" year="" vol="">
Corythaeola cristata. By Mhorag Candy, Kaimosi Tea Estate, P.O. Box 1,
Kaimosi, Kenya, is an earlier paper, No. 180, published by the East Africa
Natural History Society.
The result of five years' fieldwork, this paper provides a fascinating
insight into the life of this, by far the largest of the turacos and one which
has proved somewhat problematical to maintain as an aviary bird. Because
of this, the author's observations about this species' diet make particularly
interesting reading.
Mhorag Candy concluded that the Great Blue Turaco is frugivorous,
but buds, shoots, leaves and flowers are included in the diet. Regurgitated
leaves are fed to the nestlings from eight days onward, and possibly earlier.
When comparing the breeding behaviour of the Great Blue Turaco with
that of other turaco species, it is gratifying to see that the author's refer-
ence sources included our own magazine.
Any members interested in purchasing copies of these papers from the
East Africa Natural History Society should, I suggest, enquire about
receiving them by air mail, for surface mail seems to take an inordinately
long time.

Professor J.R. Hodges, recently returned from a tour of the Far East,
writes:
'The efforts of the Chinese authorities to rid Beijing of sparrows have
been so successful that, during a four-day visit to the city, I did not see a
single sparrow nor any other wild bird. The few weeks which I spent
recently in China, although fascinating in every other respect, were dis-
appointing for a casual bird-watcher but, of course, most of my time
was spent in the large cities. I visited some of the bird markets in Guang-
zhou, Shanghai and Nanjing but these were disappointing and had on offer
only Derby an Parrakeets, Pekin Robins, Zosterops, very brightly coloured
Silver-eared Mesias, Blue-winged Sivas and the favourite singing bird of the
Chinese, the Hwamei or Brown Laughing Thrush.
'The Botanical and Zoological Gardens in Hong Kong, of which our
Vice President Dr. K. Searle is Honorary Curator, is a lovely oasis in a
concrete desert. The charming gardens are situated almost in the heart
of the bustling city, surrounded by high-rise buildings. The aviaries,
which are beautifully planted and well kept, house more than 200 species
including such rarities as Bulwer's Pheasants and Manchurian Cranes.
Special attention is given to endangered species and the wonderful achieve-
ment in rearing to maturity more than 300 Palawan Peacock Pheasants
is well known. Less well known are the remarkable breeding successes
with the other five species of Peacock Pheasant, and with Rothschild's
Grackles, White-naped Cranes, White-winged Wood Ducks, African Pygmy
Geese and Count Raggi's Bird of Paradise. I spent several hours gawping
with incredulity, amazement and delight at the superb collection with
my attention riveted mostly on the Peacock, Bulwer's and Argus Pheasants,
several species of Crowned Pigeons and a magnificent pair of Green-winged
King Parrots.

Being interested in first breeding records, I am always on the lookout
for additional species bred in Britain and overseas. I was interested to note,
therefore,that in the March issue of the International Loridae Society's
Newsletter, Dale Thompson has compiled a list of first breedings of Loridae.

Unfortunately, unlike my list no source reference is given - in such lists it
is important to reference the breeding so as to allow others access to the
information.
Fruit Pigeons of the genus Ptilinopus are not the easiest of Columbi-
formes to breed so it is interesting to read an account in the South Austra-
lian Avicultural Society's journal by Ron Rodda on breeding the Red-
crowned P. regina. The article in the April 1988 issue gives a wealth of
avicultural data.
The May 1988 issue of Australian Aviculture contains two interesting
psittacine articles, both illustrated with colour plates. One, by Martin
Fingland, covers the distribution and status of New Zealand parrots. The
other covers the breeding of the Glossy Black Cockatoo Calyptorhynchus
lathami. The captive breeding project started several years ago in Tas-
mania is also starting to add hope for this species. Under the charge of
Peter Brown, former Curator of Harewood Bird Gardens, a total of nine
birds have been reared to independence, although some deaths have
resulted from parrot beak and feather disease (PBFD) in both adults and
young.
The Avicultural Society receives many magazines in exchange for its
own. Most are of an avicultural nature but several are from the world's
leading scientific organisations which generally are quite weighty, tech-
nically detailed volumes. The Wilson Bulletin is one such publication
which this year celebrates its centenary. Contained in the pages of the
June issue is the recording of a species of Pyrrhura conure new to science.
The species was first observed in the wild in 1980 but it was not until
five years later that specimens were collected and the species named
El Oro Parrakeet (Conure) Pyrrhura orcesi. It is restricted to a narrow
band of forest, between 600 to 1100m elevation, along the western
slope of the Ecuadorian Andes. Its range is only ca 100 km in length
and, given the current rate of deforestation in the area, it may soon be
threatened with extinction. However, the report lists the bird as com-
mon. Sixteen specimens were collected for museums - could not the same
number be collected to start a breeding programme in captivity?
Over the years, the progress of the Eastern White Stork Ciconia c. boy-
ciana has been well documented in the Avicultural Magazine and it is
pleasing to note that at last Vogelpark Walsrode in West Germany, has
succeeded in hatching and rearing four young. (I.Z.N., 34, 4:17).

lull in the breeding activities while the moult is completed. Only a few
lories, Eclectus, Aratinga conures, Grey Parrots and lovebirds have eggs or
young at the time of writing. A notable exception is a rare species not pre-
viously bred at the Park - and three females have eggs! This is the Crimson-
bellied Conure Pyrrhura rhodogaster from Brazil. The Park's two original
birds were both males but two months ago the four more recent arrivals
were sexed and found to be females. A trio was placed on exhibit and
another trio in our original breeding centre.
'Within four weeks the female on exhibit had eggs, leaving the second
female with the male. Two weeks later she too was incubating alongside
the other female. Meanwhile, in the breeding centre one female had also
laid. We will report the outcome in the next newsletter. This very beau-
tiful bird is rare in captivity. The most striking of the Pyrrhuras, it has
the entire breast crimson.
'1988 has been a year of great expansion in the parrot collection at
Loro Parque; in fact, at no other time has the collection increased so
much and we now have a total of 211 species, plus 53 subspecies of
parrots.
'One reason for this rapid expansion is the increasing difficulties in
importing parrots, whether wild-caught or captive-bred. Few more of the
former will be acquired in future; our main source of new birds will be
the breeders with whom we exchange our young birds. The majority of
those reared at Loro Parque during the past two seasons have been kept
for our breeding programme or for exchange with other breeders. Recent
exchanges include sending four White-eared Conures Pyrrhura leucotis
to Denmark in exchange for Pearly Conures P. perlata , receiving Red-
collared Lorikeets Trichoglossus haematodus rubritorquis from Holland
in exchange for Duivenbode's Lorikeets Chalcopsitta duivenbodei and,
in September,we received from the USA two female Purple-capped Lories
Lorius domic ellus, a species now very rare in aviculture, to pair with our
two males, a Weber's Lorikeet Trichoglossus haematodus weberi to make
up a pair, and two pairs of conures not previously represented in the
collection: the attractive yellow-faced St. Thomas's Conure Aratinga
pertinax pertinax and the striking Red-throated Conure A. holochlora
rubritorquis plus a pair of the Australian Scaly-breasted Lorikeet Trichch
glossus chlorolepidotus. These latter are now on exhibit, the first time that
this species, now rare in aviculture, has been seen at Loro Parque. *
'We were especially pleased to obtain a female Yellow-tailed Black
Cockatoo Calyptorhynchus funereus funereus from California. She was
obtained for the single male in the collection, thus we now have true
pairs of three forms of Black Cockatoos as White-tails and Red-tails
(Banksians) are, of course, already represented in the collection.

'Visitors to the Park should also watch out for some parrots which do
not appear on our inventory. These are the birds at liberty. Observant visi-
tors will derive much enjoyment not only from the numerous and conspic-
uous Quaker Parrakeets Myiopsitta monachus but also from those which
are more difficult to observe. They include a pair of Senegal Parrots Poi-
cephalus senegalus with their two young. They share the nest of Quaker
Parrakeets in a palm tree near Lorovision. One of the most spectacular free
fliers is the Alexandrine Parrakeet Psittacub eupatria which flew in about
eight months ago. His noisy calls constantly alert one to his presence
and his long tail makes him unmistakable in flight. He is very bold and can
often be seen stealing food from the macaws on the wall near the window
of the hand-rearing room.
'The liberty lories include the much-loved Huskies Pseudeos fuscata
which follow the food cart and help themselves to fruit. Recently more
lories have been released and these include two hybrid Black-capped x
Yellow-backed Lories Lorius lory x garrulus flavopalliatus which were
reared three years ago. Large and showy, a flash of red in flight - one of
them can often be seen with a Green-naped Lorikeet Trichoglossus k
haematodus. The hybrids do not fly together!'

The Common Bronzewing Pigeon and the Wine berry
With reference to Derek Goodwin's article (Vol. 94: 94) on the Com-
mon Bronzewing, the Wine berry mentioned is Rubus phoenicobsius. This
bears pleasant pink flowers followed by red fruits something under one
inch in length. I have not eaten one for years but recall that they were
sweet. It is quite a pleasant plant with its trusses of ornamental fruit
and its stems covered with red bristles, and would be a useful and orna-
mental plant for any enclosure. The fruiting stems are removed in autumn
in a similar fashion to raspberries.

Some 70 members and their guests attended a buffet lunch on 15th
October, 1988, in our new meeting room here at Hartley Wintney. This
was followed by a most enjoyable and interesting talk given by Mr. Brian
Pettit on the future of aviculture.
Mr. Pettit raised very important and sometimes controversial matters
and the discussion that followed was most stimulating. We are trying to
persuade Mr. Pettit to summarise his arguments in an article for the
Avicultural Magazine .
We would be very pleased to hear from any members who can give
a talk at one of these social meetings. The atmosphere is friendly and
informal with an interested audience. If you cannot give a full-length
lecture (about one hour including discussion), then a short talk of 10
minutes or so with a few slides of a particular bird or breeding, etc.,
would be a most welcome addition to the programme.
