(Actitus macularia)
By Ryan B. Walden (Supervisor, Live Animal Programme), and
John R. Quinn (Staff Artist), Academy of Natural Sciences of
Philadelphia, Penna, U.S.A.
The Spotted Sandpiper is one of the most common and generally
distributed of the summer-resident shore birds. The breeding range is
from Newfoundland, west to northern Alaska, and south to northern
South Carolina and southern California. With such a wide breeding range
t is of little wonder that the " Teeter Snipe ", as it is sometimes called,
s found in abundance on the small islands and sand-bars in the Delaware
Uver of eastern Pennsylvania.
Both parent birds work at the excavation of the nest, which is little more
han a hollow in the sand and gravel. The nest may be lined with bits
)f grass, leaves or bark which help to hide the four pale, buffy-white eggs,
ncubation is often begun as soon as the first egg is laid ; therefore, it is
common for the last chick to hatch two days after the first chick hatches,
testing activity usually begins in mid- and late May ; but when the nest
s located on the sand-bars and islands, it is not unusual for the first nesting
ittempt to be flooded out and a second nest begun in mid-June.
Shore birds often assemble in flocks, but it is rare to see more than one
&amp;gt;r two Spotted Sandpipers in the same area. Flocks of more than one
amily group are unusual even during migration. Another interesting
haracteristic of this sand-piper is the strange way it balances its body on
ts legs. The legs are slightly bent, the head and fore-part of the body
3 lowered a little, and with clockwork regularity, the rump and tail are
aised and lowered in a curious jerking motion. Due to this strange
hannerism the Spotted Sandpiper is often called the " Tip-up " or
Teeter-tail ". Young birds only a few hours old display the same
novements as the adults.
The Spotted Sandpiper can swim and dive, so if a chick is cornered
lear the water, it will not hesitate to swim. The adults have been known
o dive below the surface of the water when chased by a hawk.

2 R. B. WALDEN AND J. R. QUINN--REARING THE SPOTTED SANDPIPER
On the 19th June, 1966, while observing the movements of several
types of birds on one of the islands in the Delaware River, we disturbed a
pair of Spotted Sandpipers. In the hope of finding the nest or young,
le remained quiet until the adults settled down. In a short while the
adults changed from the alarm call to one of lesser excitement, and three
young birds were observed materializing from the pebbles and grasses,
about ten feet away from us. It was decided that an attempt would be
made to capture the chicks, so that a comparison in growth and develop-
ment rates could be made with three Piping Plover chicks which had been
incubated in captivity. The moment we began to move the young birds
froze and seemed to disappear. The location of each bird was marked
but due to the excellent protective coloration and the fading sunlight,
only one bird was captured. It was our desire to catch all three birds so
that age and growth data could be gained, and only the youngest kept to
be placed with the two-day old plovers. .
After carefully checking, it was decided that the bird which had been
captured was about three days old. As soon as the sandpiper was put in
with the plovers, it began to feed. The chick was given a balanced ration
of Purina Game Bird Starter, egg yolk, small mealworms and chopped
greens. The rate of growth was quite rapid, and within ten days
sandpiper could fly very well. The only problem encountered in raising
this bird was that the plovers started to pick at its toes ; but wi an
increase in the amount of mealworms fed, the toe-picking stopped as
^ThtT propagation of captive shore-birds is yet an infant endeavour,
although few forms have been bred successfully in zoological parks. One
must understand, though, that as man and his works push lne (TM) r ^&apos;|
north to the great tundra nurseries of this family, shore-bird aviculture
will cease its role as an interesting pastime and become a dire necessi y.
Let us begin to explore the problems now, while time is still with us.

By J. Delacour (Cleres, France)
This has been a year of transition at Cleres. After the long illness and
subsequent passing away of Frank Fooks, who had run things there so
long and so well, a complete reorganization had become necessary. It
has now been successfully effected, but it took time, and it was not too
easy to give young birds all the attention they needed during the last season.
Also the unexpected cold weather in April and May, after an unusually
mild winter, caused the infertility of many clutches, particularly among the
s*eese.
We have to contend with all sorts of parasites and virus diseases as
is the case on all grounds where birds have been introduced and kept for a
long time, coming from all parts of the world. Young birds have often
to be treated if losses are to be kept at a minimum. Fortunately Dr.
Ciarpaglini is highly competent in such matters. But it means a lot of
work. There is little doubt that better rearing accommodation, particu-
larly for waterfowl and game birds, will result in greater success in 1968.
There were, however, some satisfactory hatchings during the last breeding
season.
For the first time in many years, two young Emus were hatched and
raised. We had lost hope of ever obtaining young from our pair. The
male sat every winter on a nest of clear eggs, and he still did so last Feb-
ruary. But the hen laid four mpre eggs in March, and, to our astonish-
ment, two proved fertile. One hatched under the male, who kicked it
out at once. Found stiff and cold outside the nest, it was fortunately
revived, while the second egg was removed and hatched in an incubator.
The two Emus were successfully reared, although they were infected by
:he species of gape worms affecting geese and cranes, at the age of two
months.
Over twenty Rheas, both grey and white, were reared. We allow the
males to incubate as much as we can, but remove the eggs on the eve of
latching to avoid accidents, the chicks being raised in a heated shed.
They have to be carefully fed : coarse green food often causes intestinal
ibstruction, while an excess of protein produces leg deformation and
weakness, as the birds develop too fast.
We had no young cranes ; several pairs of Demoiselles sat on infertile
dutches. Our old breeding pair of Stanleys met with a tragic end,
peing killed and carried away, as well as several geese, in the deer park
icross the road. We naturally thought that it was the work of a fox, but
:he trap we set caught a genuine European Wild Cat, a female weighing
ii lbs. It was an almost incredible record, as the species had not been
:ound in Normandy for over a hundred years.
Dr. Ciarpaglini, who has been very successful in rearing Flamingoes at
:he Paris Zoo for the last six years, wants to try with those at Cleres.

J. DELACOUR--NEWS FROM CLARES--1967
The three large species (Central American, Chilean and European) have
been transferred to the lake, a more suitable breeding location. James s
Andeans are doing well on the clear, cold water of the river, which however
proved unsuitable to the tropical Lesser Flamingoes. These have to be
kept on more stagnant, warmer pools.
Black and Black-necked Swans nested successfully after having pro-
duced infertile clutches in April. This had never happened before.
Very few geese were reared, the best being four Orinoces and five
Andeans. There were common, South African and Ruddy Shelducks ,
two dozen Fulvous Whistling Ducks ; Philippine, Lesser Grey, Falcated,
Laysan and Red-billed Ducks ; Chestnut, Cape, Marbled and Puna Teal ;
New Zealand Scaups, White-eyes, Red-crested Pochards, Carolina
and Mandarins in numbers. We failed to rear a brood of eight Hooded
Mergansers, although we tried force feeding. }
Among the game birds we had young Malayan Firebacks, Hume s,
Cheer and Grey Peacock Pheasants, Red and Ceylon Junglefowls, and
many peafowls. ,
Brush Turkey, at liberty in the park, did well. We started with a cock
and two hens (one of which died in the summer by accident). There was
also an old male in the Emus' enclosure, but he was killed by these un-
predictable big birds after living with them for two years. The male in the
park first built a large mound close to the clutch, along the fence.
was plenty of dead leaves and humus, which we supplemented with fresh
lawn clippings. He worked hard and we caught four chicks in the neigh-
bourhood in August. Before that time he had started another mound
high up in the park, in a wood, about 800 feet away, and for over a month
he worked at both nests, running from one to the other several times each
day. We later caught four more chicks in the wood, and there may be
more of them in the park. We place the chicks we catch in a large,
planted aviary containing many other birds, including Peacock pheasants,
where they grow without difficulty. When first hatched, they are as
large and strong as ordinary three week old chickens. They never fig t,
but they pay no attention to one another, and they perch up most of the day.
A number of California and Painted Quails, Pigeons, Doves, Parrakeets
and some green Cardinals were reared, the best being Wongas, Brush and
Common Bronzewings and Grey-headed Doves. An Olive Pigeon and an
Australian Pheasant tailed Dove left the nest, but both drowned in a near-
by pool, which will be duly altered to avoid such accidents.
Our collection of cage and aviary birds still is large. Part of the indoor
ones will be shown next year to better advantage, as we plan to change the
largest hall of the chateau (ruined by fire in 1939) into a " Jewel Room
like the one I established at the New York Zoo in 1942. There will be
a dark gallery, io feet wide and 50 feet long, with twenty-four windows
opening on cages 3 feet by 3 feet, with proper lighting and service at the
back. This should be an important improvement.

By Mr. and Mrs. J. G. Weeks (Krugersdorp, South Africa)
On entering Aviary No. i on the evening of 15th February, 1967, I saw
vhat I thought was a young Melba Finch fly out from under the shelter,
rhe following evening I saw the bird again and noticed no red on the tail
eathers or green on the back like a normal young Melba finch. This bird
vas a dull grey all over.
No. 1 aviary is 47 feet by 12 feet by 7 feet high with a covered shelter on
he south (cold) side, a brick wall on the east and north sides, wire netting
&amp;gt;n the west side, and planted with flowering shrubs and three peach trees,
vhich were there before the aviaries were built. It houses a mixed collec-
lon of some forty to fifty birds including Violet-ears, Stars, Melodious
Albans, Fire Finches, Cordon-bleus, Shaft-tails (Queen Whydah), Melba
inches and a pair of Paradise Whydah birds.
On the 18th February, while feeding the birds I saw the Melba cock
eeding two young Paradise Whydahs. I never disturb any nests so I
annot describe the eggs but presume them to be identical to the Melbas,
n the meantime the hen Melba had gone to nest again in a red cestrum
&amp;gt;ush. The Paradise Whydah hen was very interested in the new nest.
)n the 19th the hen Whydah was observed flying from a perch fastened to
he top of the aviary and into the red cestrum in front of the nest and back
0 the perch again. The hen Melba refused to budge from the nest. The
ame day we phoned the Treasurer of the West Rand Bird Club who with
is son came to inspect the two young Whydahs. While they were there
hey also observed the young begging for food from the Melba Finches.
i On the 22nd three committee members from the West Rand Wild Bird
dub came to inspect the young birds which are now big, strong and
ealthy and flying well.
, 1 am now hoping for some youngsters from the second Melba nest,
hanks to our loyal servants Martha and Simon, who place termites
vhite ants) in the aviary for the birds while my wife and I are at work,
ie chances of the birds living were excellent.
A Senior Inspector of Flora and Fauna has since been to see the young
irds and is satisfied that they were bred in captivity and that this is the
rst time that this species has been bred in South Africa.
On Saturday, 4th March, I inspected the Melba's nest. There were
ine eggs five smaller than the other four eggs. One egg had a small
ole in it which I enlarged with my finger nail. The baby bird was alive,
later observed sitting on the nest a Melba Finch. On the 5th day both
irds were sitting during the day. On the 6th March after returning
om work it was observed that the nest had been completely destroyed
ith no trace of eggs.

On 8th March I discussed the destroying of the eggs and nest with Mr.
Hindly from Flora and Fauna. He said he thought the hen Whydah was
the culprit as they have a tendency to eat eggs.
On Monday, 8th May, 1967, two more young Paradise Whydahs were
seen in Aviary No. 1. The following evening both birds were seen being
fed by the Melba cock ; at no time did I notice the Melba hen near, or
feeding the young birds. It takes about two to three months for the young
to moult from their juvenile feathers to the adult plumage of the hen
Whydah. It is going to be very interesting to see how long it will take to
moult into the adult plumage of the cock birds, if there are any at all in
the young that I have bred. I hope to have bred at least one cock.
Note. January, 1968. Out of the four young birds bred we now have two
hens and two cocks. These birds are in full adult plumage and the young
cocks are beautiful specimens.

This unique breeding took place in March, 1967, in Aviary No. 13. The
size of the aviary is 50 feet by 20 feet by 7 feet, with a covered shelter on
the south, and brick wall on the west and north, and wire netting on the
east side. Planted in the aviary are four fig trees, three peach trees,
ornamental and flowering shrubs, and well grassed on the ground with a
shallow drinking pond and running water.
On entering the aviary on the evening of the 2nd March I noticed in a
small cotoniaster shrub situated near the door three young birds which
appeared to be young Violet-eared Waxbills (Granatina granitina) and
on having a closer look I noticed that one young bird had no blue on the
rump as common in a young Violet-ear.
On the following evening three members of the West Rand Cage Bird
Club came to inspect the birds and verified them to be a young Shaft-tail
and two Violet-ears.
The following day a senior inspector from Flora and Fauna, Transvaal,
Mr. J. G. Hindly, verified the breeding to be a young Shaft-tail and two
Violet-ears.
On Sunday, 5th March, while watching the birds I saw two young birds
in the cotoniaster, a pair of Violet-ears flew into the shrub followed by
three young birds and the parents then commenced to feed all five young
birds.
We then realized that there were three Shaft-tails and two Violet-ears
from the one clutch. We reported this immediately to Flora and Funa
and I have in our possession a certificate of this wonderful breeding.

C. J. O. HARRISON--NOTES ON BEHAVIOUR OF NESTING PAINTED QUAIL 7
I am hoping that this is a first breeding of a Shaft-tail in captivity. The
birds in this aviary number between forty and fifty including Black-cheeks,
Black-throated Canaries, Peters' Twinspots, Lavender Finches, Star
Finches, Diamond Doves, Chinese Painted Quails, Quail Finches,
Namaqua Doves, one pair of Shaft-tails and three pairs of Violet-ears.
These birds are given white ants (termites) three times a day which I
collect in the veldt near my home. I keep them in buckets in my aviaries.
Note. January, 1968. Out of the three young birds bred there are two
hens and one cock. The young cock is now in full adult plumage; the old
cock bird has six long feathers and the young cock has four. The two
young Violet-ears turned out to be a pair and are now in full adult
plumage.

By C. J. O. Harrison (Perivale, Middlesex, England)
During June and July, 1967 ,1 was able to make intermittent observations
on the nesting of a pair of Painted Quail (Excalfactoria chinensis ) in an
inner aviary constructed in a greenhouse. The birds had been put into
the aviary in the spring and the hen had laid several eggs but ignored
them. Later I observed copulation on several occasions. As seems to
be the case with many species in which the pair remain together for a
long period, there was relatively little in the way of display. Any indica-
tion of readiness on the part of the female must have been of a fairly subtle
nature and passed unobserved. The male would follow close behind
her, drawn up tall with the ventral feathers fluffed, and then mount with
little ceremony, usually uttering a brief nasal note as they separated.
As in most aviary nestings the female laid her eggs in a variety of places.
As I have previously stated (Harrison, Restall, and Trollope, 1965) I do
not believe that this is typical of the species in its native habitat and I
suspect it to be related to a lack of a really satisfactory site. Since,
however, some game birds will desert a nest where they have been once
disturbed there is an alternative possibility that the various scattered eggs
might represent potential sites at which the hen has suffered some
disturbance subsequent to the laying of an egg. Nor do I believe the
statement, often repeated, that the female quail lays eggs in the vicinity
of the nest in order that these may decay and provide flies for the young
quail to feed on when they hatch. This story may have had a long life,
since Darwin mentions a similar explanation used by the South Americans
to account for odd eggs around the nests of Rheas; but there are a number
of reasons for doubting it. To begin with, the quails once they have

settled on a site will roll in any nearby eggs. Secondly, such eggs if left
do not get flyblown but stay complete and finally explode, as an aviculturist
friend recently discovered. Thirdly, even if such eggs were broken and
attacked by flies the maggots would have pupated and the flies flown long
before the end of the three-week incubation period. Finally, it has been
shown by experiment with other birds that eggs left lying around are
quickly taken by predators and that their presence causes the predators to
search in the vicinity and increases the likelihood that the nest will come
to grief.
The first two eggs of the pair under observation were laid in a bare
hollow in a corner, in spite of the fact that I had put in some grass-tufts.
The third egg was laid in the middle of the aviary. I moved the first two
to join it and the fourth was laid with these. The female then switched
to a new site on a flat open space covered with a layer of seed-husk, sand,
and dead grass-stems in which she made a shallow hollow and laid the
fifth and sixth eggs. I added the first four to these and the site was used for
subsequent eggs. The female began to incubate after she had laid the
tenth egg, but since the hollow finally held thirteen, three of these must
have been laid after incubation commenced.
On the first day of incubation a glance into the aviary at midday revealed
no sign of the female but a closer inspection showed that all the dead
grass-stems lying in the vicinity of the nest had been pulled over it until it
was completely concealed and formed a low mound from which the female s
head emerged at any unexpected noise. For the first three days of incuba-
tion the female quail continued this habit of completely concealing the
nest and herself beneath a mass of stems, but subsequently she discon-
tinued this and when she left the nest the cavity with its eggs would be
visible. This behaviour during the first few days of incubation would be
advantageous under natural conditions since the nest is usually in grass
and the hens action would result in the adjacent stems being pulled over
the nest to form a roof concealing the cavity. Similar behaviour occurs
in waders such as Redshank and Snipe, which nest in grasses and conceal
the nest-cup in this fashion.
Normally such behaviour would not be necessary after the first few
days, by which time the surrounding grasses would stay in place, but in the
rather bare aviary the nest was subsequently exposed when the female left
the eggs, apparently twice a day, for food and water. There may have
been some attempt to cover the eggs during this later period. I was not
sure since I never saw her actually leaving the nest, but the eggs towards
the edge of the nest would be partly concealed by material which could
have been either pulled over by the female, or pulled up against her while
she was sitting and have fallen when she moved away. When she returned
she would stand in the cup and, lowering her head, push back these grasses
with the forehead and culmen of the bill, rotating gradually and pushing
them back all round the cup before settling to incubate.

C. J. O. HARRISON--NOTES ON BEHAVIOUR OF NESTING PAINTED QUAIL 9
During the period of incubation the male visited her and sat with her
once or twice, but always roosted by himself well away from the nest, in
marked contrast to the normal conditions when the pair roosted together
in a tight huddle. The eggs hatched after about twenty-one days, the
female being found one morning with several newly-hatched chicks
around her. Only five eggs hatched, and one chick was found dead on
the nest. By midday the female was walking around the aviary with the
four young staggering after her. Although both birds tended the young
they showed no hesitation in climbing to low shelves or ledges where the
chicks had great difficulty in following, and twice I saw chicks that were in
the path of the parent casually trodden on.
There was a marked change in the behaviour and calls of the female.
Hitherto she had been subdued and secretive, using only the faint high-
pitched piping contact call. Now she used a loud mellow clucking note,
apparently in answer to the constant shrill piping of the chicks. For a
period after the hatching she became very excited when anyone approached
the aviary, and on several such occasions she uttered a crow exactly like
that of the cock but pitched about an octave lower. At other times she
was heard to use a shorter, modified version of the crow. If anyone
entered the aviary she would draw herself up as tall as possible, fluff
up all the body feathers (but not those of head and neck) until they were
erected almost into separate tracts and she appeared twice her normal
size, and droop and partly spread her wings. In this posture she would
rush towards the intruder in what appeared to be a threatening manner,
and which might effectively have frightened off some small animal.
Faced with a larger intruder who did not withdraw she would begin to
run about in a crazy manner, and had sufficient space been available
would almost certainly have performed a distraction display.
When the chicks became too large to brood they roosted clumped
together with the parents. On the occasions that this was observed the
chicks were grouped together between the parents. Two weeks after the
brood hatched the female began to lay again, but unfortunately died about
a week later from egg-binding. One young one was lost during my
absence. The remaining three consisted of two females and a male.
The young male began to show the adult plumage characters immediately,
passing from down to full adult plumage. The patterned throat and
chestnut-red tail coverts were apparent at an early stage in the feathering.
By the fifth week the three young and the male were roosting individually,
scattered a little apart from each other. By the end of the seventh week
the older male was beginning to crow frequently and after a day or two
was seen to attack the young male. They were separated, and it was then
noted that one hen was bullying another and it became necessary to
separate them also.
In an earlier article (Harrison, 1965) I described many of the more
typical calls and postures of these birds, and further observations have

C. J. 0. HARRISON--NOTES ON BEHAVIOUR OF NESTING PAINTED QUAIL
enabled me to make a few supplementary notes on what seems to be a very
full vocabulary. The lower-pitched version of the male's crow as used
by the female during the first few days after the young were hatched was
heard again later in a different context. A different female of a young
pair was caught up and temporarily transferred to a cage within about
twelve feet of the enclosure where her partner was, with each bird out of
sight of the other. When the male crowed it was immediately answered
by this lower-pitched crow from the female.
When the older male that had lost its mate was caged alone in an en-
closure next to the young pair, he changed his crow. When paired he
had used the high-pitched, usually triple-noted, " quee-kee-kew " call,
which was also used by the young male of the other pair. Once solitary
the male began to utter a note which in volume and pitch sounded like
the initial note of the three-note call but was long-drawn with a slight
dying fall to it. I noted it down as " queer ". This note has been
continually used, apparently in place of the other, while the bird has been
alone. If the triple-note call is the advertisement call of a mated male
and announces to nearby birds that can hear but not see him that he is
present, in possession of the area, and mated ; then it would be advan-
tageous, in the thick grass cover that these birds inhabit in the wilds, for
the solitary male to be able to announce to any stray female by use of a
different call that he was present, in possession of the area, and unmated.
There is yet another call-note which I heard on earlier occasions and
concerning the function of which I was a little uncertain. In view of the
occasions on which it has been elicited recently I suspect it to refer to the
sudden appearance of potential danger overhead, and therefore probably
functioning as an alarm call indicating the presence of a hawk or some other
flying predator. The bird uttering it crouches slightly, remaining still,
and gives a rapid and fairly loud ticking note. This persistent " tic, tic,
tic, tic, tic, ..." runs on in a long sequence and is uttered rather rapidly
but with a variable speed so that it alternately slows and accelerates.
This might be an accidental effect due to the strength of the bird's reaction,
but it produces a sound rather like some small machine driven by a rather
erratically-functioning motor.

Excalf actor ia chinensis is well known to the aviculturist and a great deal
of material has been published on their husbandry. Ethologically they
are most interesting birds. Some aspects of their behaviour have been
recorded and discussed by Harrison (1965).
During the winter of 1962-3, I had, in a heated room, a box cage
containing four small estrildines and a cock E. chinensis. One of the
estrildines a cock L. senegala was frequently seen to preen the quail,
sometimes perching on his back while preening the head. The quail sat
in a passive " fluffed out " manner, turning his head to facilitate the
firefinch's preening. This pattern was varied by the firefinch standing
near the quail and during these periods the preening was usually mutual.
When a hen quail was added to the " collection " the firefinch-quail
interaction stopped.
I thought this behaviour curious and wrote a letter to the editor of the
Avicultural Magazine, hoping someone might have further information.
No interest was shown and other attempts to find " records " of this
behaviour were unsuccessful. Thinking it an isolated incident, I almost
dismissed it, until I made a number of visits to a Municipal aviary in 1965.
This behaviour was again noted in an outside flight housing about forty
passerines and a single E. chinensis cock. The table shows which species
were seen to clump and mutually preen with the quail. When these visits
were repeated in 1966, a hen quail had been added to the collection and
no further cases of quail-passerine interaction were observed.

On reading the News and Views column of this Magazine (1966) I
noticed an interesting extract from a letter by Mrs. Grace Wheatley,
who describes what would appear to be clumping and mutual preening
between a hen Yellow-breasted Waxbill and a single E. chinensis cock.
It would seem that the quail also " tit-bitted " the waxbill.
To summarize these notes, it would appear that single E. chinensis cocks
provide a " stimulus " for certain other birds. It would be considered
that the plumage pattern of the cock, which plays an important part in
social interactions (Harrison), could provide this " stimulus " for other
species. However, this could only be valid in the tit-bitting posture,
during locomotion, etc. In the clumped position only the black and
white facial mask of the conspicuous plumage would be fully visual to
other birds. The facial masks of the Harlequin Quail ( Coturnix
delegorguei) and the Rain Quail (C. coromadelica ) are similar to E. chinensis
and equally striking. I have kept single cocks of these Coturnix species
with passerines and hemipodes as " test " cases, so far the only interaction
has been a single incident of a cock C. delegorguei tit-bitting a hen
Hemipode.
The possibility that smaller birds clump with cock E. chinensis " because
they are larger " would seem unlikely as the slightly larger Rain Quail and
much larger Harlequin Quail are apparently ignored. Limited informa-
tion available seems to indicate they do not clump with quail " because
they are cold ". The fact that some of the birds clumping with the quail
are paired with conspecifics would seem to have little effect. It would be
interesting to know whether, when a hen quail is added, the normal quail
pair bond is assumed in a passive manner, or, if any aggression on the
quail's part breaks any " alien " relationship.

By Clifford Smith (Denholme, Yorks., England)
When determining the age for breeding, time for settlement, bringing
into condition and matching, the circumstances in which I acquired my
two breeding pairs of Greys should be of some help.
My first Grey was purchased from a well-known pet store in the early
summer of 1962. It was a young bird still not showing the yellow eye
of the adult, but certainly changing from the baby stage of black. Though
sold to me as a pet I, like all aviculturists, thought of breeding when I saw
another Grey in a local pet shop. This bird to me looked like a cock
although none of my literature on Greys helped me with sexing them.
This particular Grey had a bold, fearless look, was certainly darker in
colour, screeched when anyone went near it, and was larger than average
size. I was informed by the pet shop that the bird had been purchased
with the intention of being sold as a pet but the bird's " growling " was
making a sale difficult. The final blow came when the Grey began to
pluck itself, and having visions of a featherless bird, with even less chance
of a sale, the pet shop was pleased to exchange the bird for half a dozen
canaries.
The two Greys were put in adjoining flights and, after a week of head
scratching and perching close to the wire alongside each other, they were
put in the same aviary and both showed their pleasure by whistles and
coos, head scratching and beak rubbing. Within a few weeks the cock,
as it proved to be, had given up plucking and they moulted
out into two lovely birds. A nest-box was introduced in spring, 1964,
and although no attempt was made to nest, the cock was feeding its mate
and I was convinced I had a pair. In spring, 1965, I assumed by the
amount of peat being thrown from the entrance to the box, that the birds
were furnishing a nest. During May mating was observed on several
occasions so when, in the second week of June, the hen was missing for
long periods I hoped the eggs were being produced. As the hen was quite
steady I looked in the nest-box while she was feeding in the shelter.
There I found two eggs. I did not look again for fear of disturbing the
birds. Early in July I heard the unmistakable sound of young birds
being fed and from then onwards the intake of food was gradually
increased.
All went well, until September, with the hen and cock both visiting
&apos;he box and feeding, but one morning I found the cock Grey dead in the
shelter and heard no sounds from the nest-box although the hen was still
^oing in. On investigation I found one fully grown, nearly fully feathered
mung dead in the nest. As the cock had shown no sign of illness I pre-
&amp;gt;umed that he had picked up some contaminated food and also passed it
nto the chick. Success being so near I obviously had to find another cock.
Vs luck would have it Mrs. E. Wicks, of St. Leonards, advertised a cock

Grey for sale. After seeing it I was sure it was a cock, although Mrs. Wicks
had proved it, he was a large bird in excellent condition. I bought the
cock and went through the same stages of introduction as before. The
pair seemed to agree and in May, 1966, mating was observed. At the end
of June they began shaping a nest and on 16th July the first egg was laid.
On 30th July, whilst the hen was off, I saw three eggs in the nest-box.
I heard the young being fed in the nest-box on 24th August and the food
supply was increased. T. his time all went well and two fine young birds
left the nest on the 12th and 14th of November, being approximately
eighty days in the nest-box.
My second two adult birds were bought from a fancier/dealer in 1966,
who assured me they were a true pair. As they had clipped wings and
were very wild I assumed they were new imports and did not expect any
chance of breeding until they had settled down. Therefore, when I
bought a similar bird from the same fancier/dealer, also claimed to be a
cock, I did not hesitate to put all three birds together. Within a few days
the latest bird was feeding the bird sold to me as a cock of the pair. I
gave them a separate aviary with a nest-box and within five minutes they
were in it.
Over the next few weeks I hardly ever saw the birds as they were very
wild and dived into the nest-box if anyone approached within thirty yards.
At the end of August I heard the sound of young being fed, but I could
not look into the box due to the birds' nervousness. The end of November
brought a very cold spell, so realizing that the young must now be fully
feathered I decided to look into the nest-box knowing the adults would
not encourage the chicks to leave the nest.
I found one fully feathered chick which I took from the nest and had no
trouble in hand-rearing it to independence.
At the time of writing, September, 1967, the first pair again have two
youngsters five weeks old, and the wild pair have two young ready for
leaving the nest. Both pairs of birds are housed in flights 10 feet long by
5 feet wide by 6 feet high. They have a shelter 5 feet wide by 3 feet deep
in the adjoining bird room. The nest-boxes are grandfather clock type
6 feet high by 12 inches by 10 inches with a 4 inch entrance hole about
9 inches from the top. The boxes are filled with chopped turves and peat
moss to about 18 inches down from the hole and a wire ladder fixed down
the inside. The nest-boxes are in the outside flight facing north and
with no overhead cover.
The birds were fed on sunflower, canary, millet, hemp, safflower, wheat,
oats and peanuts.
When the young were being reared all the seed was soaked and this was
taken in preference to the dry seed. At least a bucketful of green food
was taken each day by the birds and this consisted of chickweed and
groundsel. Safflower and hemp seemed to be favourite so it was given
in abundance. Apple seemed to be ignored once the chicks had hatched,

and so to a smaller extent were the peanuts.
All the incubating was done by the hen, the cock feeding the hen
either at the nest-box entrance or in the flight. Within a week of the egcrs
hatching the cock was entering the box and feeding the young. After
about four weeks both the hen and the cock were continually in and out
of the box.
^ en k roo ^ s chicks at night for at least two months after hatching
When the young leave the nest they are almost identical in appearance to
the parents except that the eyes are entirely black, the tail feathers are not
as vivid a red as the adults and the general appearance is a darker but
softer grey than the adults. Within fourteen days the young were picking
up seed. ^
As my aviaries are in a very exposed and bleak part of the country with
10 trees for shelter, and as the Greys seem to be late nesters by length of
ime spent in the nest-box, I shall take the young away from the parents
vhen they are ready to leave the nest, as I do not think Greys are as hardv
is Australian parrakeets.
This is confirmed by the way in which the adults always sleep in the
\0x25A0helter at the first sign of any bad weather whereas the cockatoos and
)arrakeets often sleep out on really bad nights.
If any members are interested in Greys and seeing the pairs would help
hem in sexing, I should be pleased to welcome them.

THE BREEDING OF A YOUNG UMBRELLA

The pair was received three years ago from Gerald Kirkham, who I
elieve had imported them direct from abroad and had had them for a
~ar or two.
Unlike most cockatoos, which nearly always get used to people this
lair have remained wild and shy and dive into their barrel on the approach
myself or the keepers who they know can enter their aviary
he sexes are alike except for the eye-colour--jet black in the cock, dark
*own in the hen. This is quite distinct even at a distance of several
irds.
The first year we had them at the Tropical Bird Gardens they were
msed away from the public in a 20 foot flight and given a barrel in

1 6 D. H. S. RISDON--BREEDING A YOUNG UMBRELLA COCKATOO
The second year they were moved into a public aviary which they
shared with two Sulphur-Crested Cockatoos. As we were short of room
at the time they were not given an opportunity to breed.
This the third year we removed the Sulphur-Crests and gave them
the aviary to themselves. The size of this is approximately 14 feet long,
7 feet wide, and 8 feet high. It is constructed entirely of 2 inch weld
mesh on a framework of tubular steel. The back, ends, and part of the
roof at each end are boarded over to give shelter.
This spring (1967) the pair were given a wooden barrel about 16 inches
in diameter and 20 inches tall with a hole cut in one side near the top.
This was filled to about a quarter of its depth with the usual mixture of
rotten wood and peat and fixed as high as possible in one corner at the back
of the aviary. They took to the barrel almost at once, but nothing much
was thought of this as they had done it before and we thought they were
just using it as a refuge.
However, at the end of June it was noticed that only one bird appeared
at a time during the day so, on 7th July my assistant, Michael Curzon,
decided to investigate and reported that there was an egg in the barrel.
It was difficult to see what was going on because immediately one entered
the aviary both birds dived into the barrel, so times of laying and hatching
are only approximate. On 30th July sounds of a young one being fed
were heard. These were much the same as those made by young Cocka-
tiels or Galahs being fed.
From time to time during the following weeks feeding noises were
heard indicating that all was well and, on one occasion, Michael Curzon
managed to have a peep and saw a large well-feathered chick at the bottom
of the barrel. The baby left the nest on 1st October fully feathered and
identical to its parents except for being a bit smaller. It is steadier than
they are and does not mind being looked at.
The interesting thing is that, although the pair are so nervous, t ey
bred in an aviary which is on public exhibition and has had a stream of
hundreds of visitors passing it daily throughout the summer.
In addition to the usual seed mixture of sunflower, peanuts, and maize,
the food throughout the rearing period was a mixture of soaked bread and
chopped-up fruit in the morning and brown bread liberally smeared with
butter sprinkled with " Vitmin " in the evening. Very little green-
food was taken and strangely cuttlefish bone was ignored.
As described above, the Umbrella Cockatoo (.Kakatoe alba) has been
bred at The Tropical Bird Gardens, Rode. It is believed this may be a
first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, is requested to communicate at once
with the Hon. Secretary.

The King Vulture which was born here on 28th July, 1966, is,
ortunately, still in good health and is growing normally and well. He
ias completely lost his baby-feathers, and now he is totally anthracite
*lack. Even his head is black and also the caruncola ". On the back
e has some white feathers and the legs are dark grey.
This is the second King Vulture to be born at the Zoo from the same
air. The first one was born on 26th February, 1966, but only lived
venty days. He was never found, dead or alive. We think that it was
filed and taken away by rats.
In one of the two accompanying illustrations of the young King
ulture the mother is also shown. Unfortunately we lost her through a
ind of intestine cancer, when the young one was only four and a half
lonths old.

In May, 1945, a Javan (or Malayan) Fish-Owl was received in Regent's
ark from the late Mr. Spedan Lewis's collection at Leckford. Its age
the time of arrival was not known, but it would presumably have been
Ided to the Leckford collection at some time before the outbreak of war
r 939 , so that it may be more than thirty years of age now. In 1954
r. Searle presented us with another of the same species and after some
lsuccessful nestings and egg-laying difficulties earlier, one chick was
itched during February, 1967, but it did not survive. The parents
&apos;Sted again and one chick, now indistinguishable from the parents but
r the ring that it wears, was reared.
The nest was made in a thick layer of peat moss that covers the aviary
ielter floor and was, of course, just a scraped out hollow ; the nest was
*ncealed from public view by a sheet of hardboard, so it would have
en impossible, without causing disturbance, to observe what went on
fiind the scenes.
It is not known how many eggs were laid, but while Stuart Baker reports
Jtches of two and three, Jackson says that in west Sumatra a single egg is
e normal clutch ; a report on a nest in north Tenasserim also speaks of a
lgle egg and so does Kuroda in " Birds of the Island of Java ". The

two in a clutch. Our birds have previously tried to breed very early in
the year and it was only in 1967 that a second attempt at a more favourable
season was made. The natural foods are said to be small mammals, birds,
fish, frogs, crustaceans and large water-bugs. Our birds have been
offered fish at times, but have refused it : their diet consists of raw lean
meat, rats, mice and day-old chicks.

(Platycercus zonarius macgillimayi)
By J. J. Yealland
Among a collection of mammals and birds presented to the Society
early in 1963 by Sir Edward Hallstrom, Taronga Park, Adelaide Zoo and
the Tasmanian Protection Board (as reported in the Avicultural
Magazine, Vol. lxix, pp. 170, 171) was a pair of Cloncurry Parrakeets
which, after being exhibited at Whipsnade for that summer, came to
Regent's Park together with some of the other mammals and birds. At
first it seemed that the birds were both females, for there was no observed
evidence of courtship display and no sign of nesting in either 1964 or I 9 ^ , 5 &amp;gt;
but in 1966 two eggs were laid, the mother becoming egg-bound with the
second. In the summer of 1967 nesting again took place in a box hung
high up in the aviary shelter and a single chick was hatched and success-
fully reared. It appears to be a male and when it left the nest its chance of
survival seemed poor, for it could not fly and its plumage had been plucked
by one or both parents. However, they cared for it and did no further
damage to the plumage so that in due course it became quite presentable
and a strong flyer. It is now quite independent and is separated from the
parents.
In addition to the seed mixture and fruit, the birds are given lettuce,
sprouted wheat and, while they were rearing the chick, some watercress,
green peas in the pod when available, sometimes green lucerne and some
bread soaked in the Complan mixture that is fed to the Lorikeets. The
male sometimes ate a little of the grass growing in the flight and, of course,
cuttle-fish "bone" and limestone grit are always available to them. I
think it correct to say that the only previous importation of the Cloncurry
Parrakeet into this country was that of a pair received in 1939 by the late
Duke of Bedford, but presumably they died in the course of the wartime
period. This parrakeet is now considered to be conspecific with, among
other races, the Barnard's, Bauer's and Yellow-naped (Twenty-eight) and
though in general appearance seems nearest to the Barnard's. Dr. Lendon
(Avicultural Magazine, 1939, pp. 375-378) said that he thought it
possibly nearer to the Port Lincoln (Bauer's).

By C. J. O. Harrison (Perivale, Middlesex, England)
Although we in Western Europe tend to worry about the possibility of
the extinction of some of our birds as their range and numbers shrink
with the continuing spread of humanity, a general survey of the species
already lost in the world as a whole, suggests that the birds which are
most vulnerable are populations which occupy very limited habitats,
such as those on small islands, or in limited areas of forest which are
islands in otherwise open country. In such cases the habitat can be
rapidly destroyed or drastically reduced and the birds have no alternative
place into which to move. Although such species may be relatively
plentiful in the places where they are found, a change in surroundings or a
concerted attack upon them can quickly reduce them beyond the point
of no return ; and there are no small remnants, concealed in more in-
accessible places, which can survive.
A bird which has aroused some anxiety in recent times is Leucopsar
rothschildi , variously known as Rothschild's Mynah, Rothschild's Starling
and Rothschild's Grackle. The last name is the one most frequently
used by aviculturists, but since this is a mynah, and since the other
grackles are a group of the American troupials (Icteridae) the first name
seems preferable. This species is limited to a small area on the northern
coast of the Island of Bali in Indonesia. Bali is well known as a rather
small island as heavily populated as Britain or Japan. Its natural resources
are sorely strained, but a few years ago it was said that Rothschild's
Mynah, although very restricted in its distribution, was present in fair
numbers. About six or seven years ago, however, there were sudden
large importations of this species into Europe where hitherto it had been
very rare. One British dealer was said to have had a consignment of
^ view of the political situation in Indonesia it was impossible to
and out what was happening, but some alarm was felt for the safety of the
species.
Dr. Lee-Talbot who visited the island in 1964 commented that the
brest which afforded nesting sites for the species was being felled and
hat he saw few birds in the wilds and rather more in cages. It is not
possible to tell whether the exports were due to large numbers being
iresent, or to the birds being more concentrated in distribution and more
asily caught as their habitat was being destroyed. There have been
ome efforts to preserve the species by the Indonesians. The bird is now
&amp;gt;n the protected list and a recently created reserve in the area is said to
iave a population of it, but there is no recent information on its status.
It would not be difficult for such a species to become extinct. The
dascarene Islands of the Indian Ocean had three such mynahs which
/ere lost during historic times. One of these, the Crested Bourbon

Starling (Fregilupus varius) with a slender decurved bill and flattened
crest giving it a hoopoe-like appearance, was common on one of the
islands and was kept in cages by early settlers who stated that it ate
anything " but the nesting habitat was steadily destroyed by human
settlement and the bird is now known only by a few skins and skeletons
in museums.
In view of the doubts about the future of Rothschild s Mynah it seems
sensible to suggest that we should attempt to conserve and perpetuate the
population now in the hands of aviculturists, so that if it should be dis-
covered that the wild population is disappearing then there will still be an
aviary population of this species to turn to. When this matter was raised
in the Council of the Avicultural Society it was suggested that no one had
succeeded in maintaining a viable population of any " softbill under
aviary conditions. We recognise the difficulties involved, but the estab-
lishment of aviary populations of any species involves difficulties. Usually
there is evidence after a few years have passed that fertility is decreasing.
This has occurred in ornamental pheasants, and there is evidence of it
in the latest data on the breeding of the Ne-ne Goose, and it is said to be
appearing in populations of Australian parrakeets in aviaries. Another
difficulty usually arises if a rare species does breed well in captivity, since
both Zoos and private aviculturists tend to become bored with their
success and give the birds less opportunity to breed, apparently on the
assumption that they can always begin if the necessity arises ; but it is far
more likely that the species will be found to have disappeared without
its loss having been noted. It is a sobering thought that at one time both
Zoos and private aviculturists were breeding the Passenger Pigeon and
thinking little of it. In spite of the apparent difficulties, a co-ordinated
effort to maintain captive populations of some species seems worthwhile,
and we would ask all those fortunate enough to possess Rothschild's
Mynah to co-operate in this.
To begin with we must compile a register of the birds and need to know
the location of various pairs and individuals, what success has been
experienced in the breeding of them, and what losses ; and also what
conditions seem to be most conducive to successful breeding.
Mr. W. R. Partridge, who owns several pairs of this species, has agreed
to assemble and collate this information, and we would begin by appealing
for those who have these birds, or who know friends who possess them
and are unlikely to read this, to send in the information to Mr. W. R.
Partridge at Lower Haselor, near Evesham, Worcestershire.
At this stage we would like to know the number of birds of this species
now in the hands of any particular aviculturist ; the number bred or lost
during the past season ; and also whether the birds will be given the
opportunity to breed in the coming year.

During the Spring of 1967 two pairs of the Purple or Yellow-legged
Honeycreeper were received from the Trinidad Zoo and they were,
presumably, of the race longirostris that occurs on that island. They were
put into the Tropical House where another of the same species already
lived. This house is some 45 feet long, 30 feet wide and about 11 feet to
the roof of nylon netting ; it is planted with a variety of tropical plants
except for a paved central area where people walk through.
The pair of honeycreepers nested in a small wicker basket, with a side
entrance, hung high up near the roof : it is not known how many eggs
were laid, but one chick was reared and when it left the nest a dried egg
measuring 17 mm. by 13 mm. was found in the nest. The ground colour
of the shell was a very pale pinkish-buff and it was profusely covered with
spots and blotches of pale chestnut-buff, more heavily marked at the larger
end.
The favourite food taken to the chick by its parents was house flies :
other foods provided in this house are a liquid food based on Complan
with liver extract by day, sugar and water with the liver extract and vitamin
compound from late afternoon until early morning, fruit flies, mealworms,
substitute insectile mixture and fruit. When first out of the nest the
chick was the subject of some curiosity on the part of the other birds,
but it quickly gained assurance and for some time now has been flying
strongly and feeding itself. On leaving the nest the chick could easily be
distinguished from its mother by, of course, its shorter beak ; it also had
conspicuous yellow skin at the gape and a greyish throat.
The Red-legged, Blue or Yellow-winged Honeycreeper or Sugarbird
(C. cyaneus ) has been bred in this country on more than one occasion,
but I believe that this is the first of C. caeruleus to be bred here.

CHARLES LECK--NOTES ON THE PURPLE HONEYCREEPER
NOTES ON THE PURPLE HONEYCREEPER
AS A CAGE BIRD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985492925" page_id="58088961"  page_num="22" year="" vol="">
By Charles Leck (Ithaca, N.Y., U.S.A.)
Each year, as a student living in a rented room, I have only a small space
for cage birds. However, certain birds can do well in a minimum area,
and such birds are ideal for persons who have limited facilities. Thus,
last fall I successfully raised two broods of Zebra Finches in a small cage on
my bookshelf. This species is, of course, well known for its general hardy
nature and ease of breeding. Nevertheless, there are probably many other
species which will also quickly adapt to such restricted space, and which
will make enjoyable pets for the amateur aviculturist or student of avian
behaviour. In the following account, it will be seen that the Purple
Honeycreeper (Cyanerpes caeruleus) is one such species.
The Honeycreepers (family Coerebidae), which are also known as Sugar-
birds, are fairly small, often blue or green, and neo-tropical. The Purple
Honeycreeper is, for example, confined to the countries of northern South
America. In the wild, their food would include nectar and soft fruits, as
well as small insects. In fact, I have observed Honeycreepers feeding on
berries in Costa Rica.
My bird, an attractive male, has been maintained in good health with
such easily available foods as bread and milk, oranges, bananas, and grapes.
In addition, clean water and insect food are supplied regularly. I found
Drosophila fruit flies (obtained from any Genetics Laboratory) a convenient
source of protein for the bird. Fortunately, the fruit, by attracting the
flies, generally restricts them to the cage, where they can be easily captured
by the Honeycreeper. Thus, the insect food, in addition to being valuable
from a nutritional point of view, also evokes a variety of interesting
behaviour patterns from the Honeycreeper. It will readily catch up to
twenty fruit flies in succession, whether they be in flight or on the fruit.
Each capture is a rapid sequence of events, which includes the approach,
quick snap of the bill, and ingestion. The speed and agility with which the
bird moves during such feeding is most remarkable. And the positions
it uses in stretching out from the perch while catching insects indicate that
its legs are strong and muscular. Indeed, the observation oi the feeding
behaviour is a most interesting and enjoyable experience.
The Purple Honeycreeper also " sings " occasionally. I use quotation
marks because singing as such seems to be unknown from Honeycreepers.
Nevertheless, my bird will infrequently give a curious warble which may
last for several seconds, and be repeated several times. In general, the
sound is similar to that of the song of the Purple Finch (Carpodacus
purpureus ) of North America, but softer. Other vocalizations include
high pitched notes that are common to other species in the family.

Finally, it should be mentioned that the Purple Honeycreeper's close
dative, the Yellow-winged Sugar-bird (Cyanerpes cyaneus ), has nested
lccessfully and raised young indoors, in a small cage, when supplied with
ifficient mealworms. Thus, the Purple Honeycreeper, which in itself
to be recommended as an interesting small cage bird, is also to be
^commended as a species which can probably be bred in captivity with

Due to the warm and dry summer weather, breeding results in May,
ine, July and August, 1967, were very good. Worth mentioning are
lirty-four young Rheas; two of them died, but the others so far are doing
ell. After the good results we had last year with the hand-rearing of a
ybrid Pelican ( P . rufescens x P. crispus) we again decided to put an egg
ito the incubator. This time, a White Pelican hatched and is now being
and-reared as his predecessor. In the meantime, he has grown up to
le size of a large duck.
In our Flamingo colony, consisting of seventy-seven specimens, five
uropean Flamingos hatched in May. One disappeared, however, and
mother was killed in a thunderstorm. The remaining three have grown
msiderably and are well fed by the adults. The Chilean Flamingos
;ared one chick.
The following waterfowl hatched and are likely to be reared: 1 Cuban
Whistling Duck, 10 Red-crested Pochards, 6 Mandarin Ducks, 17 Wood
&apos;ucks, 2 Lesser White-fronted Geese, 3 Bar-headed Geese, 4 Lesser
now Geese, 2 Canada Geese, 2 Cackling Canada Geese, 3 Common
helducks, 6 Black Swans (out of 7 eggs), 1 Oystercatcher. Two Black-
saded Ibises were successfully reared by their parents. Furthermore, we
red 5 Palawan Peacock Pheasants, 3 Common Peacock Pheasants, 2 Great
rgus Pheasants, 20 Ocellated Turkeys, 2 Vieillots Crested Firebacks,
Siamese Firebacks, 4 Korean Ring-necked Pheasants, 1 Elliot's Pheasant,
Reeves's Pheasants. On 5th June, a Condor hatched and was very well
d by its parents. On 17th July, however, the chick was found dead,
he post-mortem examination revealed that it died from an overburden
ith big stones in his stomach. As usual, the Eagle-Owls and the Great
orned Owls bred : each family had three young ones. Our old female
nowy Owl laid only one egg. In order to get another clutch, the first
as put into the incubator, the young hatched, was hand-reared and is
)w as big as its parents. Our pair of Blue Mountain-Parrakeets reared
' o young, the Grey-breasted Parrakeets also two young.
The following birds were bought : 5 Blacksmith Plovers, 5 Crowned
&apos;overs, 4 European Avocets, 1 White Asiatic Crane, 4 Stanley Cranes,

It is now over ten years since Mr. L. W. Hill purchased an estate at
Bourton-on-the-Water to fulfill a dream he had had ever since he was a
small boy who lived next door. After having carefully developed the
grounds as a beautiful garden with comfortable quarters for birds Mr.
Hill opened the gardens to the public in 1958 as " Birdland " a title
which he has fully maintained. From the beginning it was his aim to
show the birds to their best advantage and to give them as much freedom
as possible--his pet African Grey Parrot " Juno " flying unconcernedly
among the big trees and coming back to the house as he pleaded was
followed by free-flying Macaws. Soon a Trumpeter was walking con-
fidently among the visitors, Pheasants pecked about in the undergrowth
and gradually the number of free-ranging birds was increased until the
impression gained is that the majority of the inhabitants of Birdland are
wandering about at will. Mr. Hill has a great gift for taming birds and
giving them confidence and it is a revelation to walk round the gardens
with him and to see the welcome he receives from birds which by nature
are by no means trustful.
Gradually more enclosures and aviaries were constructed, pools anc
streams made, and the number and variety of species of birds increased
But all the development was motivated by the fundamental idea of pro-
viding the best possible setting for the birds and this was achieved witl
that sense of beauty which in Mr. Hill is innate. Birdland has now be^
come world-famous and is a tangible example of dedication and happ?
co-operation, for the success is due to the fact that Mr. Hill has beei
supported and helped by Mrs. Hill and their family, each taking a par
in the management and running of the gardens.
Mr. Hill has always made a point of using the gardens as a means 0
giving pleasure to those who are not so fortunate. Numerous parties. 0
handicapped children have been entertained and from the beginning
old-age pensioners were admitted free ; as a result they felt a personal
pride in the gardens and constituted themselves honorary wardens!
keeping a sharp eye for anyone who might harm the birds or plants|
Money has been collected for a number of good causes including substanti;
amounts for the World Wildlife Fund.

A great landmark in the history of Birdland was the construction in
1965 of a new tropical house, a building of great beauty in which ideal
conditions for tropical birds have been achieved. It is very simple in
design with a convex roof measuring 40 by 60 feet made of Filon glass
fibre reinforced polyester sheeting ; thus there is a minimum loss of heat
while the maximum natural light into the building is obtained. The
material, however, is sufficiently opaque to obviate the birds dashing
themselves against it ; it is also tough and weatherproof. The roof is
supported by an unobtrusive light aluminium frame which the birds use
for perching purposes. The main hall is well planted with trees, shrubs
and flowering plants, a stream and waterfall ensure humidity and the whole
forms a perfect setting for the tropical birds, all of which are free-flying.
In the outer hall are the " Jewel enclosures " housing several species of
beautiful Humming Birds ; these enclosures are based on the design of the
late Captain de Quincey, that great expert in the keeping of Humming
Birds.
Mr. Hill supplied the following notes on his birds in July, 1967 :
* 4 The new tropical house is now really settling down and is approaching
the end of its second year. Spur-winged Plover are nesting and are now
sitting on eggs, but the most pleasing thing of all is that within a few
weeks of arrival the Snowy-headed Robin Chats ( Cossypha niveicapilla )
built a nest and reared one youngster, but unfortunately it had a deformed
beak and leg. Since then they have built two more nests and have now
commenced a fourth, having reared three young in all. The nesting
habits seem to be similar to those of the White-browed Robin Chats which
now have their fourth nest with two strong youngsters, five days old. I
would say that the only marked thing I have noticed is that the Snowy-
headed are far more shy that the White-browed for the latter nested
within a foot of the door jamb to my house entrance. Most of the nests
are not more than 5 feet from the ground, one exception being the first
which was made in a large hanging basket of Medinilla, but the youngsters
plummeted down on to the pathway to their deaths. It took not more
than five days to build the nest of wet, rough vegetation lined with dry,
fine hair and sisal type strands from the stems of Banana trees. The two
eggs are a rich brown coffee-bean colour, very beautiful with a lovely polish.
The White-browed Robin Chats successfully reared nine youngsters.
Unfortunately the eggs of the Humming Birds were clear and the
Violet-backed Tanagers deserted fertile eggs after six days.
The following species inhabit this house : Blue-throated Sylph
(Aglaiocercus kingi ), Pale-bellied Hermit ( Pliaethornis anthophilus ),

brevirostris), Blue-grey Tanager ( Thraupis virens nesophila).
In the tropical house at the main entrance, which measures 60 by
16 feet the Bleeding-heart Pigeons ( Gallicolumba luzonica) reared three
youngsters in their three broods. Other birds in this house are the
Black-headed Sugar Bird ( Chlorophanes spiza ), Grey-headed Kingfisher
(Halcyon leucocephala ), Green-crowned, Brilliant or Amethyst Flying
Dolphin (Heliodoxa jaciila ), White-breasted Waterhen (. Amaurornis
phoenicurus) and Roulroul Partridge ( Rollulus roulroul).
The hen Giant Hornbill was in a nest from 7th March to 3rd May but
nothing materialized. In the large aviary the Bower Bird started building
a bower on 25th March and completed it in ten days, but repairs it daily
and thickens it, decorating it every morning with approximately five pieces
of small green leaves off clover, with grass.
This bird has a special liking for flies, large house-flies, moths, etc.
I purchased a special moth-trap and collected large quantities of moths,
carefully culling them and releasing the rare species and then feeding the
residue to the Chats. The Minivets also enjoyed them. I got quite
friendly with two frogs which, when I emptied my trap just before dawn,
were always waiting for the ones which dropped through the night ; these
two were quite content, their backs to the sodium light, picking off any
strays.
In the Penguin enclosure the King Penguin has one young and one
bird is sitting ; unfortunately one pair had their egg stolen five days
before it was due to hatch. Humboldt's and Jackass Penguins are sitting.
The Spreo Starlings have two lovely youngsters, Swainson's Lorikeets
have one pair of youngsters and are now sitting again ; Purple-capped
Lories, which have managed to raise a brood each year for the past three
years, are sitting and the Black-capped Lory is also sitting. The Eclectus
Parrot is sitting and the Hahn's Macaws have a nest full of youngsters
again ".
In July, 1967, yet another innovation was introduced to Birdland
with the establishment of a Lecture Hall which was formally opened by
Peter Scott in the presence of leading aviculturists and naturalists from
all over the British Isles. A mural of a view in the neighbourhood of
Bourton-on-the-Water depicting a flight of duck rising over a stream,
executed by Peter Scott, was unveiled by Jean Delacour on the same
occasion and both paid tribute to the achievements of Mr. Hill and his
family. The hall will be used for meetings and films on natural history
will be shown, and thus the educational value of Birdland will be even more
enhanced.

During the 1914-1918 War it was customary for troops stationed at
Bulford, Wiltshire, to carve their regimental badges in a chalk hillside of
Salisbury Plain. New Zealand troops carved a Kiwi, with the letters

parting gesture before leaving Kiwi Barracks for Gibraltar the 1st Bn.

One would not have thought it necessary to draw attention to the fact
that the Society's waterfowl rings are intended for use on waterfowl, and
on waterfowl only. A ring just recovered was worn by a (? Collared)
Turtle Dove ! It is, of course, just possible that the ring was taken off a
dead bird by someone and placed on the dove. But we did have a very
similar occurrence some years ago--same suspected ringer, same recovery

of Yellow-fronted Kakarikis had nests of seven and seven, and now (mid-
November) six young ones are just coming out of the nest. I must add,
however, that from a second pair of Yellow-fronted and from three pairs
of Red-fronted we had nothing, which makes a poor overall result

Before the very severe winter of 1962-63, Kent Brook, which adjoins
our property, was locally well known as a haunt of Kingfishers. Fortun-
ately they have recovered to such an extent that we have an occasional
visitor to one of our three ponds. The pleasure of seeing them is perhaps
tempered by the knowledge that they are taking some of the smaller fish,
probably up to about three inches. I do not know how large a fish a King-
fisher can take but Witherby records a young Pike of nearly five inches.

Guy Detry, Wavre, Belgium, writes: " In late August one of my two
pairs of Malachite Kingfishers ( Corythornis cristata) tunnelled in a bank
erected in my outside aviary. Six eggs were laid and incubated during
five weeks. But, probably due to the fact that the male was not in perfect
breeding condition, none of them proved to be fertile. I had two wonder-
ful Cameroon Shining-blue Kingfishers ( Alcedo quadribrachys guentheri),
purely fish-eaters. I kept them in tip-top condition for more than a year,
but I had eventually to dispose of them (they went to the Antwerp Zoo),
as finding small, live fish all the year round proved to present too many
problems

A. W. Bowden, Haverhill, has recently bred the Pagoda Myna ( Temenu -
chus pagodarum). One young one was successfully reared in the first
nest ; but in the second the three young had to be destroyed after leaving
the nest as they were severely affected by rickets.
Breeding records are few. The Society's Medal was awarded to the
Rev. C. D. Farrar in 1901, three young being reared. As this breeder was
successful with Malabar, Andaman and Pagoda in little over a year his
results were by some just a little suspect. But as printed the records seem
definite enough. Two young were reared at the London Zoo in 1923.
Three young were fully reared with J. H. Gurney, in 1931 ; two were
still alive when the collection was dispersed in 1934.

The 89 th Annual Report of the Royal Zoological Society of South
Australia records that the number of bird species bred at the Adelaide
Zoo during the 1966-67 season was not as many as in the previous year.
One hundred and twenty-nine birds of forty-four species and varieties were
bred, including three Razor-billed Curassows, two Southern Stone
Curlews, two Nicobar Pigeons, and one Red-tailed Black Cockatoo.
The standard and variety of exhibits were well maintained and a good
selection, particularly of Australian species, was on display. The variety
of exotic species that can be exhibited is, however, restricted by the limita-
tions imposed by the Australian quarantine regulations---these regulations
forbid the importation of birds into Australia from any country except
New Zealand.
The Report mentions two notable events : " For the first time in twenty
years six Brush-Turkeys were bred naturally in a mound and, thanks to
the State Department of Fauna Conservation who gave us permission to
collect some eggs, three young Mallee-Fowls were successfully hatched in
an artificial incubator and reared ".

CAGE AND AVIARY BIRDS. By D. H. S. Risdon. Faber &amp; Faber,
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991657925" page_id="58088975"  page_num="32" year="" vol="">
London, 1967. Price 285.
One's first impression on seeing this book is that it is just another
run-of-the mill " book on bird-keeping for beginners. In a sense this is
so, but it is decidedly better than most of its kind, or at least than most of
those I have seen. A main reason for this is, clearly, the author's fondness
for, and interest in, birds which those who have read his various papers in
our Magazine (and for those who haven't I suggest they obtain, at least the
issues of the late forties wherein he gave graphic accounts of his experiences
with various species in really large aviaries) will be well aware of.
Mr. Risdon stresses the fact that cages for pet birds cannot be too big
and that one should buy the largest cage one can afford. In a small and
comprehensive book it is impossible to give the fullest possible information
about the care of every species mentioned but more specific and detailed
directions are given than in most similar books.
The author states that he has made no attempt at scientific grouping,
but he has at least given us the scientific names. I think that even in
a book for beginners it would not have been flirting too dangerously with
Science to have pointed out that the term " finch ", as used in aviculture,
includes both carduelines and estrildines, and that the " whydahs " here
described belong to different groups within the weaver family, one the
parasitic whydahs and the other, a group of long-tailed bishops.
Since I have kept only a minority of the species mentioned I can only
say of the advice as to care and feeding given that it seems to be pretty
sound. I noted for example that, unlike most who give advice to beginners
on feeding the Corvidae, Mr. Risdon, rightly, points out that the Magpie
is best given more animal food than is needed by a Jay. I am, however,
sceptical as to what percentage of Cordon-blues or Blue-breasted Waxbills
will survive the British winter outdoors even with a " snug " shelter
and I certainly think that no one should attempt to winter any waxbills
in an unheated aviary or bird room. There is considerable difference
between Mr. Risdon's advice not to let the temperature of a room in
which Gouldian Finches are kept fall below 7 0 centigrade and that of
Ziegler who, in his monograph on the Gouldian Finch and its care and
breeding, states that Gouldians begin to vegetate with cold at 12
centigrade, begin to live at 18 0 , become lively at 2i* and feel really happy
at 24 0 .
The book is illustrated with numerous black and white photographs and
sketches and a coloured frontispiece (repeated on the cover) of the author
with a Red and Yellow Macaw.

iUMMING BIRDS--FLYING JEWELS. By Walter Scheithauer.
Translated from the original German by Gwynne Vevers. Arthur
Barker Ltd., London, 1967. Price 455.
Buffon very aptly remarks " Of all animated beings, the Humming
Erd is the most elegant in form and the most brilliant in colour. Stones
&amp;gt;nd metals polished by art are not comparable to this gem of nature ".
t is evidence of the growing interest in these lovely birds to have yet
.nother book which illustrates in seventy-six coloured photographs
ypical examples and also gives information as to how they may be kept
n captivity, which species to choose, and how they may be fed. The
irst live Humming Bird to arrive in Europe was a Sparkling Violet-ear
Colibri coruscans ) which was exhibited at the London Zoo in 1905, but
&amp;gt;nly survived fourteen days. In the past sixty years much has been
earnt about their proper care, which depends primarily on correct
eeding and the author gives an account of his own experience and also
hat of European Zoos. He considers that he has solved this problem
&amp;gt;f diet and has used the following basic recipe for some months with
;reat success: 800 gm. water, 121 gm. honey and 38 gm. Nektar-Mill II
a ready-mixed baby food). With this mixture it was not necessary to
hange the food in the evening when the need for food is particularly
;reat. The habits of the birds are described in detail and methods of
eeping them. Finally there is a section on how to photograph Humming
lirds in flight and the necessary technical equipment. The results are
hown in the coloured illustrations and depict the wonderful variety in
olour and form displayed by these very interesting birds. It may be the
eviewer's prejudice, however, but the colours, striking as they are, fail to
;ive such an accurate impression of the living bird as paintings by artists
uch as Audubon, Gould, and many others.

birds of prey. About iiooo B.C. the climate improved and for some
millenia the country became covered with an open birch forest with a
little pine and the original avifauna was replaced by different species of
birds. Then followed the pine forest period succeeded by the oak mixed
forest period and their avifaunas are identified from remains in the
deposits of human inhabitants. About the middle of the last millenium
B.C. there was a climatic depression and the inhabitants were obliged to
protect their domestic animals in the winter. Human settlements
became more permanent and more land was reclaimed from the forest.
Then followed historical times down to 1750 A.D., but without any
reliable ornithological literature. Since this period the landscape of
Denmark has changed considerably and also its bird fauna.
The 282 species of birds now breeding in Denmark are allotted to a
number of faunal types based on ecological and zoogeographical zonation.
This total for various reasons is reduced by fourteen, leaving 268 species
most of which are known to breed or to have bred in the country. These
are classified into six main geographical divisions with sixteen sub-
divisions; there is also a list of species dependent on cultivated areas.
The list of Danish birds throughout the ages includes notes on the
evolution of Danish ornithology from the middle of the 18th century,
the first known contributors being E. Pontoppidan (1698-1764) and
M. T. Briinnich (1737-1827) and especially J. D. Petersen (i 7 i 7 " I 7 8 7 )-
Finally, there is a systematic list of species of birds included in the
material with notes on their occurrence and the dates they were first
known in Denmark.

FIRST BREEDING OF MEYER'S PARROT

At the moment I am the proud possessor of ten Meyer's, viz., my adult pair,
three 1966 birds (one cock and two hens) which are flying in a small aviary by
themselves, two 1967 youngsters (believed one cock and one hen) flying with their
parents, a third, believed a cock, of the same hatch in my bird room which I am
trying to train for a pet, and two further young in the nest. I looked at the latter
this morning (Dec. 16th) and they are fully feathered and will be out of the nest-box
at any moment. In point of fact, there were three, but during the recent snow-
storm about ten days ago, I found the third lying in the snow having died from cold
and exposure.
I had one other interesting breeding this season, namely a Redrump X Many
Coloured. As I had failed for two years to obtain a mate for my hen Many Coloured
and she took a fancy to a cock Redrump in the next aviary I put them together and
they went to nest quite quickly.
Four eggs were laid but only two hatched and in point of fact, two young hybrids
were in the nest-box when Mr. Raymond Sawyer visited me and I took them out
and showed them to him although, of course, they were only partly fledged. Both
reached maturity and the hen looked just like a Redrump but the cock bird has
the distinct characteristics of both parents. The hen died during the recent storm
but I still have the cock and intend to mate him back to his mother in the spring 1968.
My pair of Roseates completed the hat trick for me having bred to maturity
three youngsters in 1965, three in 1966 and one in 1967 (there were two, but one
died).
I understand that hybrids do not qualify for a claim to " first breeding " and
it is for that reason that I have not mentioned the Redrump X Many Coloured
before.

PELICANS

Since the virtual disappearance of the Brown Pelican (Pelicanus occidentalis) as a
breeding bird along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico, we in Louisiana have
been greatly concerned over the loss of our state bird from our area.
It is probably much too late to ascertain which of the many theories, if any of
them, represents the true reason or reasons for the loss of this spectacular bird
from our region. However, we are now interested in the possibility of re-establish-
ment and are trying to locate anyone who has had any success in breeding these
birds in captivity.
We are considering the possibility that locally reared birds might be suitable for
the re-establishment of a breeding colony on the coastal islands.
In order to do anything along this line a great deal of information is necessary
and we would very much appreciate learning of anyone who has had any experience
at all in breeding or keeping pelicans.
W/e would be very grateful indeed if any individuals or institutions in England
or on the continent who might have had some success in keeping or rearing pelicans
would send us information.

The breeding and successful rearing of Colibri coruscans by Mrs. K. M. Scamell
is one of the true pinnacles in British avicultural achievement, and I am sure that
the council of the Avicultural Society, on behalf of the members, will recognize it as
such *
Mrs. Scamell's ability to breed insectivorous, fruit, and nectar feeding species
marks her as an outstanding aviculturist by any standards. . . ,
In this country the near success of the late Captain R. S. de Quincey with
Trochilus polytmus, and Mrs. Scamell's complete success with Colibri coruscans,
both occurred in heated glass houses with access to outside flights. It is not
likely that the more varied insect fare available and the lack of competition trom
other species in the same flights brought the ultimate success, rather than the
reliance on a particular artificial nectar?
Further to this, do we, as aviculturists, rely too much upon the so-called complete
foods, maggots, mealworms, seed mixtures, vitamin, and trace-elements preparations
that are available commercially ? f
With these aids we can keep large collections, but do we not cut the percentage ol
our breeding achievements by taking the easy path ? ^ g PILSBURY

NUTRITION OF NECTAR-FEEDING BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999584" page_id="58088979"  page_num="36" year="" vol="">
In view of Mr. Hastings' slightly misleading comments on nutrition in the
May-June number, 1967, of the Magazine and elsewhere, it seems advisable to
point out one or two facts of basic nutrition in order to balance the picture. F y,
birds need a source of food to build and maintain body structure, and find this in
protein. The most readily available source of protein is animals and small
organisms, and most birds utilize insects or similar creatures to feed the young^a
a period when growth is occurring, although they themselves may normally eat
other things ; and will take small quantities of protein in the form of live
food, soft foods, or seeds to maintain themselves and supply their own nee " .
The other principal need is for a source of energy in order to maintain aetitv ty
and this is supplied either directly by sugars in some form, or by more complex
compounds such as starches which are broken down into sugars during d g
Sugar is. in fact, the source of energy for them all. o ..
In addition vitamins are needed. These do not nourish the bird directly but
ensure correct bodily functioning, and are normally only needed m mmute Quanti-
ties, often mere traces. Minerals of various kinds are also needed in vary g
quantities, again often as mere traces ; and with both vitamins and minerals an
excess may be as harmful as a deficiency.

A nectar-feeding bird lives mainly on sugar, and the type of sugar used must
lecessarily be a matter for experiment. The only obvious objection to cane sugar
s that it is one of the more complex sugar molecules and slightly more digestion is
leeded in order to break it down for absorption. This will apply equally to white
;ugar, brown sugar, syrup and molasses. The fulminations by late 19th and early
"oth century physicians against white sugar, which Mr. Hastings has at times
quoted, were based on the fact that the poor of the period relied for nourishment
lpon white sugar and white flour. Their diet therefore lacked sufficient vitamins
tnd minerals. In circumstances where both vitamins and minerals are added to a
iiet such comments cease to be valid.
Protein in some form is, of course, also necessary for nectar-feeders ; and large
juantities will be necessary when young are being reared. Ultimately the real
est for any diet is the results which it yields in terms of the life-span of the bird
ind its ability to breed ; although we must remember that other factors will also
iffect these results where captive birds are concerned.

NUTRITION OF HUMMING BIRDS

I trust you will give me some space in the Magazine to make a rather belated
eply to Mrs. ScamelPs comments on my letter on the nutrition of Humming
lirds which appeared in the May/June issue, 1967. First I would ask Mrs.
*Icamell two questions: Where did she obtain her Humming Birds, as she says for
7 years, and why did she not exhibit them before 1962, being one of the leading
xhibitors and when any Humming Bird was a winner ? Secondly, if she had a
&amp;gt;reeding pair of these birds in 1964, why did she buy a hen (my selection) from me
n the fall of 1965 ? I suspect that it is the hen she purchased from me that she
&amp;gt;red from.
The articles that appeared in Cage and Aviary Birds proved nothing other than
he ignorance of the writers of the subject in question, nutrition and vitamins,
drs. Scamell in her article in the July/August issue, states that her food contains
itamins A, D (by yeast) where in fact the former are fat-soluble and yeast contains
nly the Vitamin B group which are water-soluble.
Let us examine in detail the food recommended, the main ingredient being white
ugar, which the great scientist who discovered Insulin, Dr. F. G. Banting, called
The scourge of civilisation To produce white sugar, which is pure carbo-
tydrates, the cane is crushed, the first of which is like squelchy mud ; this is
&apos;rocessed and processed until we get, on the one hand white crystals of sugar, on
tie other, a black thick
syrupy mixture called molasses.
I now give the analysis
f both, side by side:

The above scientific information substantiates my statement that sugar has
" no food value " in the nutritional sense and supplies energy only. Now to this
Mrs. Scamell adds one quarter of an ounce of Gerval, the analysis given on the
container as follows: protein, by Soya bean, 65%, Carbohydrates (by difference),
22 - 45 %, Ash 6-6%, moisture 5%, Fiber o-6% and Fat 0*24%, so taking out the
Soya, which sinks to the bottom and the carbohydrates (being sugar) this leaves
about 13% of one quarter of an ounce of synthetic vitamins, distributed in pints
of water. Does Mrs. Scamell seriously claim that this concoction comprises a
completely nutritional food for nectar-feeding birds, which cover Humming Birds
to Lories. I maintain that it will not and I am willing to back my statement.
In her own words she says this food is the best she has ever used, and the Hum-
ming Bird she has reared to be as strong as any bird she has. A perfect combination
for a practical test. So I challenge this lady to place her bird with the zoological
department of one of our leading universities with instructions that the bird is fed
solely on her food as given. I will say that the bird will have a short life, and that
post-mortem will almost certainly show a chronic disease of the liver, possibly
with cancerous conditions, or distentions or perforated, with acute inflamation of
the mouth, tongue and gullet and severe dehydration of the body, etc. If Mrs.
Scamell will accept this challenge I am willing to wager #200 (more if she likes)
that I am correct in this statement. Also, to take a further step, with a similar
wager, a similar test with twelve freshly trapped Humming Birds to be equally split
between two separate universities, one lot to be fed on Mrs. Scamell's food and one
lot to be fed on Stimulite Nectar Food, purchased from any food stores; feeding and
symptoms to be strictly recorded daily, and I will maintain that the group fed on
Stimulite will come out of the test best in every way.
To comment further on Mrs. Scammell's claim of the vitamins her food contains
I would like an explanation of how such vitamins can be in this mixture in view
of the comments above. To comment on the breeding, I cannot see any claim
by anyone about the birds being " easy to breed ". The reason is simple; the
keeping of these birds is the " infant " of aviculture. There is no personal
accomplishment in breeding--give the birds, or anything, facilities to breed and
they will follow nature's instincts. This is illustrated by the fact that within a few
months of the late Capt. R. S. de Quincey completing his new tropical bird house,
his Streamer-tail Hummers went to nest and had two babies, which lived for
about thirteen days. Then again, the very first season Mrs. Scamell provides her
birds with similar facilities, an aviary, they at once go to the job. Her success, if
any, in rearing, is obviously not due to the food, but to the fact that the birds have
access to unlimited numbers of fruit flies and similar insects, gnats, etc., drawn to
the aviary by the food and conditions.

(Deroptyus accipitrinus)
By A. A. Prestwich (Edenbridge, Kent)
The Hawk-headed Parrot was named Psittacus accipitrinus by Linnaeus
in 1758, presumably on account of a fancied hawk-like appearance.
In 1832 Wagler established the monotypic genus Deroptyus , meaning
" neck (and) fan ", in allusion to the erectile ruff.
Peters lists two races: accipitrinus (Linnaeus), tropical northern South
America from eastern Venezuela and the Guianas south to eastern Ecuador
r) and the north bank of the lower Amazon; and fuscifrons Hellmayr,
south bank of the lower Amazon from the Tapajoz to Para (city) and
probably to Maranhao.
Specimens from Ecuador and Maranhao are larger and apparently
subspecifically distinct. Authorities are, however, divided on this point.
Vhereas Bangs and Penard suggest that fuscifrons may be the immature
ff accipitrinus , Griscom and Greenway regard them as two very distinct
aces. Cory says that fuscifrons is: ''Like D. a. accipitrinus (Linn.),
:&amp;gt;ut differs in lacking the coppery or rosy-red patches on the base of the
)uter tail feathers and in having the whole forehead and crown uniformlv
lusky or only slightly mottled with brownish white. The ground color
)f the sides of the head is darker brown ".
One could give English names to the two races by referring to them as
juiana and Brazilian respectively.
Very little appears to have been WTitten about this parrot in the natural
tate, and the little is usually of the most commonplace. We are merely
old that it is less numerous than many other species, it lives in dense
orests, in pairs or more rarely in small companies, nests in holes in trees,
ays tw r o to four white eggs, erects its ruff when angered, etc., etc.
Dr. Emil A. Goeldi is, however, original. He visited the coast region
&amp;gt;f South Guyana in 1895, an&amp;lt; ^ writes: " Descending the river [Counany]
text morning I was much pleased with a flight of Deroptyus accipitrinus ,
he Collar-Parrot, called 'Anaca ', one of the most aberrant of the New-
\orld psittacine forms, reminding one of an Australian Cockatoo,
everything is aberrant in this bird, even its cry, which is a loud Kia-kia-
ta--gui-gui-giii, and different from that of any other neotropical Parrot,
believe it is the first time that this species has been noted in the South

RALPH C. SMALL--HAND-REARING THE HAWK-HEADED PARROT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998484785714286" page_id="58088999"  page_num="40" year="" vol="">
The Hawk-headed Parrot has been known for several hundred years:
Clusius described it under the name Psittacus elegans as early as 1605;
Edwards depicted it in 1751; and Brisson described it as Psittacus vartus
indicus from a living bird in the possession of the Marquise de Pompadour,
in 1760. The Zoological Society of London received its first example in
i8e6, since when it has frequently been represented in the Collection.
The Ruffed Parrot, to give it its alternative and perhaps more appropriate
name (Dorothy Snyder's Red-Fan Parrot can quite reasonably be dis-
regarded) has always been rather rarely imported. Consequently only a
few aviculturists have had the pleasure of possessing even one, let alone a
pair with the attendant possibility of breeding.
V The only records of complete success appear to be to the credit of the
Chicago Zoological Park, three single young ones reared in 1965, and one
hand-reared in 1966 (see R. C. Small).

(Deroptyus accipitrinus)
By Ralph C. Small (Parrot Keeper, Chicago Zoological Park, Brookfield
Illinois, U.S.A.)
It was decided to remove nest-box because of work being done on t 4
cages the Hawk-heads were in. On removing nest-box, there was a thre
to seven-day-old baby found along with one infertile egg. The decisioi
was made to hand-feed the baby and hope for the best. . This was th
fourth successful nest for this pair. Three babies were raised in 19^
The baby Hawk-head was placed in a thermostatically contro e
The temperature was placed at 95 0 F, and as it grew, the temperature wa
gradually lowered to 75 0 when pin feathers were completely opened,
the bottom of the box were used paper towels or paper sanitary han e
chiefs at first. Later we used sawdust.

Feedings were given by spoon. We started with a small demitasse
spoon and worked it up to a tablespoon as it grew bigger. These spoons
were bent in a vice to make a funnel shape at the end of the spoon, so it
was easy to pour the food into the bill. It usually takes one or two
feedings with a spoon before they really take to it. Most important, the
food must be warm at all times. This was done by keeping the food
holder in hot water throughout feeding. The feeding formula we used
was as follows:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.821486">
2 tablespoons sunflower seeds
2 tablespoons white millet ^ hulled
2 tablespoons raw peanuts J
</footnote>
<equation confidence="0.5466335" page_id="58089000"  page_num="41" year="" vol="">
i tablespoon dog chow
i tablespoon rabbit pellets
i tablespoon mynah pellets
i tablespoon mixed pablum cereal
i teaspoon vitamin mineral supplement
\ teaspoon Di-calcium.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998518928571428" page_id="58089000"  page_num="41" year="" vol="">
All of this was placed in a blender and ground into a fine powder and
stored in a can for use. About a tablespoon of this mixture is mixed in a
small container with hot water and then left until it is entirely soaked with
water. This is made into a thin porridge into which is put a few drops
of a very good liquid vitamin. This container we keep in hot water for
the whole feeding to keep it warm.
I have always used a fresh mixture for each feeding. If kept over a
long period of time, it might sour and cause trouble. The formula has
to be wet enough to supply all the moisture needed for all its requirements.
If the crop becomes a little hard to feel, give a little warm water and
squeeze crop gently until it is again quite soft. Do not feed again until
crop is empty.
About every ten days give a little gravel in its food, and if you notice
the baby is taking less food than normal, try a little gravel and it usually
goes back to full feedings.
This has been the best baby I have ever hand-raised. The formula
would hold a full eight hours. As it grew older, the time between feedings
became less. Most babies, the food only holds them two to four hours,
and that means getting up at night for the first few weeks.
The baby grew quite rapidly. At twelve days, could see eye movement
under the skin. Slits were starting to show where eyes should be. At
ourteen days, one eye was partially open, and the second eye opened two
iays later. Pin feathers were also starting to open at this time. At
:wenty-two days, I noticed that it could see movement. At twenty-eight
lays, started holding food in mouth and chewing on it. Also at this time
was when fresh fruit, such as grapes, oranges, apples, carrots, bananas,
ind soaked raisins, was given. Sunflower, millet, canary, and raw
Peanuts were also started. Raw peanuts the baby still plays with, but

eats very little. In fact, this baby lives almost entirely on fruit. The
parents also live almost entirely on fruit, but they do like peanuts in the shell.
In the baby's water is put a good liquid vitamin and a little Di-calcium.
At thirty days, I noticed it preening its feathers for the first time. At
fifty-four days, it started to fly. This is when our trouble started. It was
quite hard to keep him from trying to roost on the back of a two-year-old
pet Macaw, and it would fly into the middle of three baby Macaws that
we were still hand-feeding. This baby is afraid of nothing.
The parents of this baby are also fearless. The male got out one time
and attacked a male Red and Yellow Macaw that had young. The only
thing that saved the Hawk-headed Parrot was its speed. I think the
Macaw was so surprised that it didn't think of attacking. At the time I
thought it would be one dead male Hawk-headed Parrot.
If ever you have a chance to hand-feed one of these babies, I am sure
it will prove to be a very enjoyable experience. This has been the nicest
of all the parrot-type birds I have hand-raised so far. It has turned out
to be a real lovable pet, or should I say pest.

BREEDING FESTIVE TANAGERS
(Tanaga cyanocephala )

By Mrs. K. M. Scamell (Newdigate, Surrey)
The Festive Tanager is also known as the Blue-headed Tanager and
the Red-necked Tanager. It is found in South-east Brazil and is rarely
imported into the U.K. In the male the upper neck is red which faded
to a duller orange red after the first moult with us. The throat and head
is a brilliant blue. The general body colour is green with the mantle
jet-black and the belly yellowish. The wings and tail have black markings
and a small black area surrounds the beak. The ear-coverts are green
and a narrow yellow bar is seen at the shoulder. The female is duller
generally and is easily sexed by the mantle which carries a dull black
pattern, whereas the mantle of the male is jet black all over.
In July, 1966, a friend of ours, the well-known aviculturist Dr. Beraut,
of Rio de Janeiro, was paying a visit to this country and presented us with,
among other rare birds, the pair of Festive Tanagers we now have. I air
not sure of the history of this pair but they were very tame and I seem tc
recall they had been in Dr. Beraut's aviaries for some time. We accom-
modated the pair in a compartment in our conservatory which is normally
given over to Humming Birds. The compartment had access through &amp;lt;
pop-hole to a newly planted outdoor flight measuring approximately
10 feet in length by 4 feet in width by 7 feet 6 inches high. These Tanager
and three Manakins among the collection so kindly given us had been fee
in Brazil on a special food preparation plus diced fruit; we have continue*
to feed these birds in the same way ever since and they seem to do wel

on this diet. Before using this food preparation we had not been too
successful in over-wintering Manakins in garden aviaries with heated
shelters, but this problem seems to have been overcome, at least in two of
the species, the Military Manakin (Ilicura militaris) and Azara's Long-
tailed Manakin (Chiroxiphia caudata) which now withstand our verv
variable climate. I give below the food formula as given to us by Dr.
Beraut:
Mix to a stiff paste--
i /3 rd very finely minced Ox-heart
1/3rd finely grated carrot
1 /3rd cornflour paste.
To this paste which is fed to seven small birds, I add a teaspoonful of
Gevral-Protein Food and some finely cubed Edam cheese and diced
tomato. If desired the cheese and tomato can be fed separately. I
believe Dr. Beraut also adds a few drops of Scotts Emulsion but I dis-
continued this as I thought the contents of the smallest bottle I could buy
were going rancid before it could be used. I feed this food preparation
first thing each morning, removing all other food remains. At about
11 a.m. I provide finely diced fruit (apple, pear and grapes) and in warm
weather any remains of the meat preparation is removed late in the day.
With regard to the heart meat, I buy a pound or so at a time, de-fat and
very finely mince it and divide it into daily portions, wrap each portion
separately in polythene and hold the packets in the deep-freeze compart-
ment (o* F.) until required. Each packet takes less than an hour to
thaw out before mixing with the other ingredients. The cornflour paste
is prepared by pouring say not more than five or six days' requirement of
dry cornflour into a pan, mixing with it sufficient water to make a thick
paste which I bring to the boil, stirring all the time, and cook for about
five minutes when it should be very stiff. This is stored in a domestic
refrigerator and keeps five or six days. The finely grated carrots are
prepared fresh daily.
The Festive Tanagers quickly settled down, spending most of the
daylight hours in the flight searching for insects in the grass and low
shrubs. A half-open fronted nest-box was fixed about 6 feet up in the
flight facing north and a round wicker basket in the shelter compartment.
In the autumn (which would have been spring in S.E. Brazil) quantities
of leaves and grasses were carried into the shelter and though this was
continued for many weeks, no actual nest was built in 1966. Throughout
the winter they were let out in the flight each day unless it was freezing
and the pair were shown at the Foreign Birds League Show at Nottingham
and also at the National at Olympia, being awarded, if I remember rightly,
a first and second in their class.
During late March and April, 1967, the Festive Tanagers again collected
large quantities of leaves, grasses and even cotton wool and laid these
materials on the shelter floor. We partly filled the outside nest-box with

grasses in the hope they would select this as a nesting site, but continued
to shut the birds in their shelter at night as frosts were still occurring and
we were not sure how the pair would stand up to a night frost. Some
interest was at last being shown in the outside box, but on 22nd i\Iay a
broken egg was found in the shelter. The egg fragments were whitish
in colour with brown splashes more numerous at the round end. From
this day we ceased to shut them in at night and the birds now began to
build a nest in the box in the flight. On the 29th May there was one egg
in a deeply cupped nest in this box and the material used was entirely
grasses, no leaves could be seen or felt.
There was a second egg the next day. I did not check on the 3 IS ^ Way,
and on the 1st June the hen was incubating. A check when she was in
the shelter feeding two days later disclosed a third. 4 he nest-cup was
very deep and no attempt was made to lift the eggs so I cannot add any
more to the coloration than I mentioned earlier. Incubation was normal
and was carried out as far as we know by the hen alone. In fact, late
some evenings one could observe the cock roosting alone in the shelter.
Three chicks were hatched either late on the 12th June or early on the
13th June, the 12th or 13th day after incubation commenced. I fed
sponge-cake soaked in nectar (which they ignored) fruit, the usual meat
preparation and small gentles. This live food had been supplied to them
daily after incubation had commenced and was the first live food given
them by us. The food was consumed in increasing quantities and was
fed to the young by both parents in turn. There were some heavy
thunderstorms on the 25th and 26th June and it was feared that the rain
would get into the nest-box, but a check disclosed what I thought was
two young birds fully fledged and quite dry in the deep cup, well to the
back of the box. I was very glad we had sited the open front to the north.
In the early afternoon of the 28th June just as we were going out I
spotted a young Festive Tanager perched on a shrub in the flight. It was
a bluish colour with dark markings on the wings and back. The weather
was fine and warm and as we watched a second young bird appeared on
the edge of the nest-box and dived for cover with the parents making
quite a commotion. As we did not expect to be back until after dark it
was thought that the best thing to do was to catch the two young birds
and shut them safely in the shelter with their parents. Before doing this
I checked the nest and out flew a third bird, smaller than the other two,
but fully fledged. This was the 15th or 16th day after hatching. We
kept the family in the shelter for two days and on the 30th June, in fine
and warm weather, we opened the pop-hole door and from that day for
some time they slept in the flight, each taking up a position in one or other
of the shrubs. They would settle down before dusk and were so motion-
less it was difficult at times to see them at all.
About this time we added soft skinned mealworms to the diet, but they
still continued to consume gentles, the meat preparation and two dishes a

day of diced fruit. It was amusing to see them lining up on a perch
calling for food. After a while both parents would commence to feed
them until they ceased to gape. Though the young birds were in fine
condition and could fly strongly from the moment they left the nest, they
made no attempt to feed themselves so far as we had time to observe.
However, on the 23rd July (the 25th day after leaving the nest) a change
came over the situation. The parents suddenly started carrying nesting
material and ignored the young birds demands for food. In the afternoon
the parents started to attack the young birds so we thought it was time to
catch up the youngsters and cage them. They were very wild at first
but soon steadied down and were quite able to feed themselves. We
quickly ceased feeding live food.
The parents carried nesting material for months afterwards and though
we put up two more nest-boxes in the flight and at different heights they
never went to nest again in 1967. This was very disappointing, but I
think we left the young birds with them too long and the parents did not
come into the peak of breeding condition again that year. We disposed
of the young birds to friends and as far as I know r two were cocks and
one a hen.
At the time of writing (January, 1968), the parents have moulted out
again and daily bring into the shelter masses of leaves and grasses. I have
put up a nest-box in the shelter, just like the one they used in the flight
last summer, but they ignore it and first thing each morning when the
pop-hole to the flight is opened they are outside fussing around the three
nest-boxes. In these boxes they also hoard cut up grapes from the
previous day and these tit-bits are consumed in advance of the dish of
fruit they will receive later! The species seem able to stand a lot of
cold weather, any amount of rain, and I would term them better than
half-hardy. If we get a decent spring I shall leave them out at night a
little earlier this year and hope that they will breed again.

By Paolo Bertagnolio (Rome, Italy)
In August, 1967, Mr. Teresio Zucca, a keen softbills keeper of Rivoli
(Torino) paid me a visit. He came to Rome on purpose to see a collection
of about two hundred Tanagers, Euphonias, Chlorophonias, Honey-
creepers, etc., which I had freshly imported from Brazil through my good
friend Prof. Giuseppe Rossi della Riva of Sao Paulo.
In the course of our talk Mr. Zucca told me (without apparently
attaching great importance to it) that he had just obtained two chicks
by the pairing of two Tanagers of different species. As hybrids between
Tanagers are decidedly uncommon I asked Mr. Zucca for more particulars
in order to write a brief article for this Magazine.
With the aid of some colour slides subsequently received it was possible
to identify the male as a Blue-necked Tanager ( Tangara cyanicollis ) of the
sub-species granadensis (or perhaps cyanicollis ), while the female no doubt
was a Golden-masked Tanager ( Tangara nigro cincta larvata). The male
had been purchased during 1966, and the female had been in the possession
of Mr. Zucca since 1961.
About the end of the spring of 1967 the two birds were released in a
well-planted aviary 17 feet long, 10 feet wide and 7 feet high, together with
other softbills (mostly males) namely: Rufous-bellied Niltavas, Violaceous
Euphonias, Blue-naped Chlorophonias, Red-necked Tanagers, Paradise
Tanagers, Yellow-winged Sugarbirds, Indigo Buntings, Rainbow Buntings
and Gouldian Finches.
Soon a Blue-necked Tanager male was observed passing food to the
Golden-masked female. The latter, at the end of June, began to collect
dead bamboo leaves, grasses and wood wool, carrying them to a wire nest
(of the type commonly employed for Canaries) attached to the wall in the
covered portion of the flight.
A rough structure was completed in three or four days and immediately
after two eggs were laid on two consecutive days. Their colour was
whitish, spotted with brown, especially on the large end.
Incubation was carried out by the female, assiduously fed on the nest by
her mate. The latter, towards the tenth day, was seen on a few occasions
incubating for very short periods, of two or three minutes each time.
Two chicks hatched out after twelve or thirteen days. They grew
rapidly, fed by both parents who consumed large quantities of mealworms
and bread and milk. They left the nest at the age of fifteen days and ten
days later they were perfectly able to control their flight.
At this time they were mainly fed by their father who now also made
use of small pieces of apple and grapes.
The predominant colour of the hybrids was grey-browm, lighter on the
breast and darker on the head and neck.

At present the rump and the upper tail-coverts are turning to green
(the fact cannot surprise if we bear in mind that the male has a yellow
rump and upper tail-coverts, while in the same areas the female light
blue), while head and neck show a mixture of yellow and light blue feathers.
To conclude, I wish to point out that during all the phases of the breeding
there were no quarrels with other inhabitants of the flight, even when some
of them, by chance, passed near the nest.

PYRRHURA CONURES AND OTHERS
By Rosemary Low
My Pearly Conures (Pyrrhura perlata ) have once again hatched three
youngsters (see Avicultural Magazine, Vol. 73, No. 1). They were
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.965934484848485" page_id="58089006"  page_num="47" year="" vol="">
even later breeding in 1967 and at the time of writing (21st October) the
youngsters are still in the nest-box. The first egg was laid on the 24th
August. When I inspected the box on the 16th September there was
one youngster; by the 23rd three had hatched. As in the previous year,
four eggs were laid, the first presumably being clear. The youngsters
are now feathering up nicely but as these birds spend nearly eight weeks
in the nest-box, I do not expect them to emerge until the second week in
November.
Last year's three young Pearlies form part of a small colony of Pyrrhuras
with an adult Pearly, a single Red-bellied Conure (I also have a pair) and
a pair of Black-tailed (sometimes called Maroon-tailed) Conures (Pyrrhura
melanura) and live fairly amicably with a pair of Cockatiels and a
hen Malayan Long-tailed Parrakeet. It is fascinating to observe the
behaviour of a small colony of similar species; the " pecking order " is
most pronounced.
I cannot imagine that there is a more colourful species of Conure than
the Scarlet-bellied (Pyrrhura rhodogaster). A pair of these birds were
seen at the World Show of the C.O.M. held in Rotterdam in 1965, having
been brought from Brazil. They were greatly admired by everyone who
saw them--but the numbers of their admirers decreased rapidly on learning
their price, which ran into three figures! I often wondered what became
of these birds until I visited Amsterdam Zoo in May, 1967, and saw what
appeared to be the same pair of birds.
The colouring of this species really is breathtaking! The whole of the
underparts from the upper chest to the vent are brilliant scarlet, in contrast
to the dark green upper parts. The cheeks are yellowish-green, the
scaled markings typical of the genus are whitish below the throat and
blue, black and white at the back of the head. The thighs and part of
the wings are blue and there is some blue on the cheeks. The under
tail-coverts are black, the upper tail-coverts maroon. The underwing
coverts are scarlet.*
* A coloured plate of this species appeared in the Avicultural Magazine for
June 1928.

I hope that Amsterdam Zoo are successful in breeding from these
lovely birds.
I have recently purchased a pair of young Aubrey's Parrots ( Poicephalus
gulielmi aubreyanus). This is a sub-species of the Jardine's Parrot which
it closely resembles. As the birds are in immature plumage, the beak is
apparently the only means of identification. According to the late Duke
of Bedford, the upper mandible is whitish, the lower one black, while in
the Jardine's it is black with a pale mark near the base of the upper
mandible.
The plumage is at present dark green with the exception of the wings
which are black scalloped with dark green. The forehead is also black
with two or three orange feathers beginning to appear. A few more
orange feathers are showing on the thighs, at the bend of the wing and
on the inside edge of the wing. The tail is black. In adult plumage
they will show much more orange on the head, thighs and wings.
I feel certain that I have a true pair as there is a very pronounced
difference in the upper mandibles. The " cock " has a flat ridge running
down the centre of the mandible, twice as wide as that of the hen. His
beak is also more massive.
They have a very soft call note: " PIoo "--more reminiscent of an owl
than a parrot!--besides some quiet chirping call notes. They feed
mainly on sunflower seed, apple and grapes.
I was extremely pleased to acquire these birds which are very rarely
imported. I had long admired a tame specimen at the London Zoo.

In the May-June, 1967, number of Avicultural Magazine Robin
L. Restall has a very interesting article about the Brown Grosbeak
(Neorhynchus peruvianus ).
In 1964 I bred the first young in Denmark and I too, have studied the
literature.
In " Stuefuglene," May, 1962, the Danish Avicultural Magazine , the
editor, Albrecht-Moller, who since 1931 bred eight species of Sporophila ,
and in all has possessed eighteen species, gave a description and informa-
tion about N. peruvianus.
The first firm to import these birds to Europe was Schonlube, Berlin.
A collection of them arrived in 1927, as usual with Sporophila , mostly
males, but Berlin Zoo obtained one pair, and Karl Neunzig gave an
illustration in " Gefiederte Welt ", not a very good one. After Rudolf
Neunzig had found out the species, the German name was given as

to me very fit and the translation is used in Denmark. In Liibeck,
Germany, there were six on exhibition on nth-i2th December, 1927*
and it was regarded as a sensation. On 23rd February, 1938, Otto
Steinhagen wrote in " Gefiederte Welt ", that he had a female laying eggs
but with no mention of young. A label on a skin in the Berlin Museum
says that a Mr. Stefani bred this bird in 1927-32.
In January, 1931, there were again some on the German market and in
1932 Rudolf Neunzig reports that he bought two pairs in Copenhagen,
where they had been for nine months. This must have been in i 93 *"
when Karl and Rudolf Neunzig visited the town as judges at an exhibition.
In i960 Albrecht-Moller bought a male, and in 1962 he bought a pair.
In " Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia ",
de Schaunsee, in a revision of the genus Sporophila, writes, that N.
peruvianus and Sp. simplex inhabit the arid Pacific littoral of Ecuador and
Peru. N. peruvianus has a strongly curved, parrot-like maxilla, and the
female of this species is nothing but a giant relation of Sp. simplex , a
hen-plumaged species. He altered the name to Sp. peruviana. Females
of both have exactly the same colour pattern on the wing and are very
similar in general coloration. There are two races. The Peruvian race
is the larger and the following measurements are given:

lives in the arid, tropical Zone of Ecuador ", and this Zone is in the south-
western part of Ecuador, not in the north-eastern, where it is humid
tropical.
As for my own experience with the species, I obtained the first specimens
in 1963, one male and two females. From Ecuador, 1964, a pair was
released in an outdoor aviary, 150 cm. by 250 cm. by 200 cm. in height,
with some ten other seed-eating birds of the same size. There were
plenty of pine-branches in the aviary, and on 18th July I unexpectedly
saw a fledgling of Sp. peruviana. It had a short tail and its general
appearance was much like the female. The young thrived well, but about
the 1 st September the male suddenly began chasing the offspring, which
already had some wounds when I got it out of the aviary.
2nd September--I found a nest, very flimsy, woven from coco-fibre.
The three eggs were greenish-white with some brown spots.
10th September--There were three nestlings, the skin very light with
some dark down.
16th September--One was found dead on the floor.

30th November--One young was killed by a cat, so I was left with only
one, which a month later proved to be a male.
About 24th July, 1964, Albrecht-Moller had one young from his pair.
The young male was, with an imported female, given to a friend, and in
1965 they bred one young.
The group of Sporophila is a very interesting one, with thirty-seven
species and about thirty-three sub-species, of different size, with very
great difference in bill-size and form. Of the more seldom imported
species I have at present Sp. telasco, which nested January, 1966;
the nest with four eggs unfortunately destroyed by some other inhabitant
of the indoor aviary. The female died later, and now there are two males
and a female left. Furthermore, I have obtained three Sp. obscura obscura ,
also imported from Ecuador.
All Sporophila are very aggressive towards each other, especially at
breeding times; they even go so far as to kill each other. Therefore
only one pair in each aviary.

THE ROLE OF SENTIMENT IN AVICULTURE

Here is a fascinating subject on which entire books could have been
and no doubt have been written. One of my dictionaries defines
" sentiment " as a " general emotional attitude ", also a tendency to be
influenced by emotion, not reason ". Both definitions apply with more
or less emphasis to the aviculturists I know from long years of personal
experience.
First of all, nine out of ten bird-hobbyists maintain a quite pronounced
emotional (feeling) attitude to their birds, of whatever species these may
happen to be. As a matter of fact, the liking they manifested at first
for their feathered charges soon grew into fondness as a result of familiarity,
daily familiarity with their more or less appealing ways and individual
behaviour, and ultimately matured in pronounced affection for given
individuals, not infrequently called " pets ". This liking I have found
even among pet-shop keepers, principally women, who are supposed to
be in business solely for the sake of the " almighty dollar ", and not for
sentimental reasons. However, there exists a certain affinity between
man and birds, which seems to be irresistible on both sides.
It is perhaps no exaggeration to aver that most species of birds kept in
confinement make a definite emotional appeal to their keepers by various
means. First of all, there is plumage colour: the more striking it happens
to be, the more " ohs " and " ahs " it is likely to elicit from the bird-keepers
and their friends. These excited, even joyous exclamations, oft repeated,
make such a deep impression on the former, who are daily, if not hourly,

affected by this display of colour that they themselves cannot help exclaim
over its magnificence whenever they feel like showing their birds off to
visitors and friends. These oft-repeated exclamations tend, of course,
to deepen their affection for their birds, a highly personal and individual
feeling, the expression of which, whether voiced or unvoiced, affords these
bird-men and women considerable satisfaction, if not actual happiness.
Next to plumage colour, aviary birds make a pronounced emotional
appeal to their keepers by means of their voices. Many an aviculturist
" specializes " so to say, this writer included, in keeping birds mainly
for the sake of their singing capabilities. This " captive " bird music
expressed in its natural, instinctive form, especially when emanating from
the throats of highly accomplished avian performers, such as the Nightin-
gale, Blackbird, Oriole, et al., has been known to " lift " the listener into
a near-trance, from which he is reluctant to be awakened. The appeal
made by such bird music is almost 100% emotional, reasoning having no
place whatever in it.
When the voices of birds either by natural or artificial means can be
made to resemble, even in the slightest degree, those of human beings,
their emotional effect is almost 100% plus! In partial proof I need only
cite the relationship of keepers of parrot-like birds, who in a great many
instances maintain very close, if not intimate, connections with their
feathered friends day in and day out, bestowing most conscientious care
and tenderest " love " on them, going at times to the extreme of kissing
them. Especially is this the case of parrots raised by hand, who seem to
thrive on such " personal " relationships with their owners and keepers.
Of course, their usually colourful plumage also plays an important part
in the affection with which their keeper regards them.
To a considerably lesser extent, specific behaviour of certain species of
birds, such as grace of movement, dexterity in flight, fearlessness of human
beings, and many other aspects peculiar to this or that species may call
forth a strong feeling reaction, usually one of liking and admiration, in
the beholder.
So, our aviculturists, at least the ones I have known for the past twenty-
five years, are creatures of emotion when it is a matter of their hobby,
which only in rare cases is combined with making money. The very
enjoyment of their pastime is for them pure joy and great personal
satisfaction most of the time. And why shouldn't it so be? The majority
of them are but little concerned with the so-called objective, semi-
scientific behaviour of their birds: their relationship to ornithology is
indeed not only fragile, but in most cases unintentional; and this despite
the fact that through his intimate relationship with his birds, many an
aviculturist gathers over the years a truly large amount of worthwhile
information relating to the behaviour of his birds--information often
unknown to students of bird life, and which, if properly analysed and
classified, as well as promptly reported, would add appreciably to the
general fund of bird knowledge.

The 1967 breeding season at Leckford, like all seasons in a large
collection, was partly good and partly disappointing. I would like just
once to have a season which was without failures.
Black and Black-necked Swans bred well as they generally do, the former
of which we have three breeding pairs, are nesting all the year round.
The latest broods are two of six cygnets each, one brood hatched mid-
November and the other on the 1st December. The cygnets are perhaps
the hardiest of all baby waterfowl and are indifferent to frost and snow as
long as they have always plenty of food and swimming water. It is
strange that this species which in a natural state must never meet iced
conditions and nearly always lives in high temperatures should be so
hardy. . , .
We have at last reared Coscoroba Swans. We have had a laying
female, bred in Philadelphia Zoo, who has laid several clutches annually
for a number of years. But first of all every mate we bought her, when
sent over from Plolland, proved to be another female. I think we bought
four such one after the other. Finally we got a magnificent male, but
each year the eggs were clear. About three years ago when Mr. Peter
Kooy, Sr., was here I asked him if he would try and find me a male from
their dealers' importations. This he kindly did and the male arrived, a
much smaller bird than the original, in fact about the same size as the
female. This year he was put with her and her original mate put with a
wild-caught female who has never laid. The old lady accepted him, but
when spring arrived the old male was in marvellous fettle charging up and
even attacking when we went to feed him while the Kooy male swam about
quietly with the female. And I, poor mutt, was sure the original male
had finally got orientated to our seasons while the new male was not,
so I swopped them over and the old lady laid six clear eggs! Back tney
were changed, the result four fertile eggs which we took after the female
had sat about half time and put them under a Sumatra game hen. Four
cygnets hatched and were reared, three females and one male. The
cygnets, as is well known, are marked rather like young Fulvous Tree Ducks
and have the tree ducklings head band.
We reared our first Eytons Tree ducks, the first bred in this country,
but we had a hand-reared female bred by Mr. Kooy. The eggs rather
small and more pointed than other Tree Ducks. The ducklings are
sandy coloured and the flank stripe is continuous from the trailing edge
of the wing to the stern and not broken into blotches. We also reared
Whitefaced and Fulvous ducklings but unfortunately only four of the
latter as the drake got caught by a stoat which injured his neck and though
his two wives laid as usual two or three clutches each all the subsequent
e ggs were clear.

TERRY JONES--THE 1 967 BREEDING SEASON AT LECKFORD 53
We bred a good number of Ross's and Bar-head, but the Red-breasted
were a sad blow. We had procured some wild-caught ganders which
apparently had not become thoroughly at home, the result completely
clear clutches, only one goose paired to a hand-reared gander produced
any fertile eggs.
The Cackling gander fell for a domestic cock and his mate consoled
herself with a Lesser White-fronted gander when her mate was not
looking; the result three goslings which looked like minute dusky Canadas.
They were exceptionally tame and were given to friends into whose house
they march for tea, two little geese and a gander, Illy, Jitty and Mate.
The star performer amongst the geese was the female Abyssinian Blue-
wing who laid five clutches, after hatching eight out of eight from her
fourth; we were so overloaded with Abyssinians that we ate the fifth!
We reared broods from all the Shelduck except the Radjah and the
European. Of the former we have an imported pair of the New Guinea
race of which the female lost a foot in the hard winter of 1963. I thought
she was going to lay this spring. She chose a box, was very noisy and
just did not make it. Perhaps next spring.
We deliberately didn't hatch any eggs from a number of the commoner
species and from those for which there is little or no demand such as
Laysan, Philippine and Chestnut-breasted Teal. The trouble with the
Mallards is that with the exception of the Northern, they are dull coloured.
I like them. I think Yellowbills and Philippines are elegant and the
Laysan delightfully tame, but they all breed like rabbits and no one
seems to want them so we set none of these eggs. No one since the late
Lord Lilford, so far as I know, has made a collection of the Mallards.
He had a curator, whom most of us knew only as an old man, Arthur
Moody, and he had an expression when showing off the more unusual
members of the Mallard family which has passed into the language of
breeders today: "Not showy but rare ''.
We obtained wild-caught Puna Teal drakes so had the first new blood
in this species which we have kept going from a single pair imported in
1938 or 39. Four New Zealand Brown Teal were hatched and reared,
easily reared, but difficult because they would bite each other s eyes and
one or other continually had a torn lid.
Tom Spence sent us his pair of White-naped Cranes before he went to
Australia. I did not really expect them to breed as they had little time to
settle dowrn. They did lay, however, one egg hatched and the other had a
fully formed chick. The chick was reared exactly as the Sarus chick
about which I wrote in detail. As a little chick it was nothing like so
tame as the baby Sarus, would not take food from one's fingers and never
had the dual affection for us and for the hen foster mother as the Sarus
had. But after it grew up it became very tame and likes human company
--provided it knows the humans.

The Parrakeets were not so good as usual. Our two old pairs of
Stanleys produced three each instead of six each as last year. The third
pair, a young home-bred hen and a cock lent by Sir Crawford McCullagh,
had six clear eggs. The very old pair of Princess of Wales have gone to
Mr. Dolton. The No. 2 pair, about six years old which have bred
regularly, never laid. I suspect I gave them the wrong box; one should
number nest-boxes if they are removed in winter so they can be replaced
as before. Two pairs of Pennant's produced seven young, but four
cracked their skulls in night panics. This is something that happens
annually here and I think it is probably due to the width of our aviaries.
They are 8 feet wide and 35 feet long. Most breeders' aviaries are quite
narrow so if youngsters panic in the night as they fly in the dark, one or
other wing is almost bound to hit the wire bringing them to the ground
while our birds must quite often go to the whole way hitting either the
end wire or the house at full speed.
The late Duke of Bedford, when Marquess of Tavistock, used to write
most amusing and interesting articles on his birds and he invented a
sinister character called Mr. X who brought on sudden and unexpected
tragedies just when everything seemed to be going fine. Like the Marquess,
Mr. X seems particularly interested in the parrot families and people who
keep them have fairly regular visits from him. He generally looks at our
birds at night, but this year he took a peep at a brood of Princess of Wales
in the nest and forgot to shut the box again so I found four quilled babies
dead on the flight floor; it had been raining steadily. Provided things
appear normal I don't look in the boxes nor go into the flights. This
aviary contained two pairs consisting of three 1966 birds, two hens and a
cock and an adult cock. The old cock and a hen had this brood. The
backs are kept closed by swivel fasteners. The birds, particularly Princess
of Wales, are always fooling around their boxes and I suspect someone
was trying to alight on the back and turned the button. I shall put bolts
on before next season. They laid again and produced a fine youngster,
a singleton. This later fractured its skull! The last pair of Princess of
Wales consisting of an Australian-bred cock and a home-bred hen, who
had bred normally the two previous seasons. The hen laid and ate her
first three clutches and then sat on her fourth and reared three nice
youngsters. Finally the pair of Rock Peplars, which belong to Peter
Paris, laid four clear eggs. Perhaps next year . . .!

By M. Peaker and Stephanie J. Peaker (Hong Kong)
In recent months a controversy has developed amongst aviculturists on
the composition of food for maintaining Humming Birds in captivity.
Articles and letters have appeared in Avicultural Magazine and in
Cage and Aviary Birds. In general, the well-known importer and dealer,
Mr. P. H. Hastings has criticized the use of foods other than his own
Stimulite brand by experienced and successful aviculturists. Unfor-
tunately, the basis for his arguments appear to be shrouded in serious
misinterpretations of what he calls " scientific facts ".
This controversy has prompted us to analyse the feeding of Humming
Birds on a reasoned physiological basis and to compare the underlying
principles of the formation of existing diets.
All diets for the maintenance of birds in captivity must take into account
the natural food of the animals in the wild. It has often been recorded
that Humming Birds feed on nectar together with insects and other small
invertebrates. Nectar is a solution consisting mainly of sugars--usually
glucose and fructose in approximately equal proportions and in some plants,
sucrose (see Spector, 1956). The live insects consist mainly (apart from
water) of protein together with fat, some carbohydrate, minerals and
certain other compounds. The sugar from the nectar is absorbed into
the body and used for all the bird's activities as a source of energy. Any
excess can be converted into glycogen, which acts only as an energy store
for use in an emergency or into fat. Complex carbohydrates ingested as
part of the insect or as sucrose in nectar are broken down into simple
sugars (glucose, fructose) in the intestine and dealt with in a similar
manner.
Fat taken into the body is used in the structural form of cells, as an
energy source or as an energy reserve in the form of fat deposits in some
animals.
Therefore, in the Humming Bird, the sugar from ingested nectar is the
main supply of energy for the processes of the body. The extremely high
metabolic rate of these birds necessitates an extremely large carbohydrate
intake.
Animal bodies consist, to a very great extent, of protein and, therefore,
substances containing protein must be ingested. The insect's body is
broken down in the alimentary canal of the bird and the protein into
amino-acids. These amino-acids are absorbed from the intestine and
built up into the bird's own protein. Amino-acids, if not required
immediately for protein synthesis, cannot be stored and are then in part
used to supply energy and in part excreted as uric acid in the urine.
In the wild, insects supply the necessary protein and it appears that a
variety of insects in large quantities and nectar could maintain a bird in

captivity. However, sufficient insects usually cannot be given so that the
basic sugar solution must be supplemented with substances that would
normally be present in the insect part of the diet. Knowing that protein
must be given, there is a choice of how this can be done as comp ex
proteins, amino-acids or chains of amino-acids (polypeptides). In
whichever form it is given, it enters the bloodstream of the bird as amino-
acids (with a few exceptions that do not arise here).
All the amino-acids are utilized to build up the Humming Bird's own
protein and if one or several are missing in the diet, they can be synthesized
from others by a process known as transamination. However, hig er
animals have lost the ability to construct certain amino-acids from those
already present and these must be included in the diet. One of the most
important misunderstandings in animal nutrition is the list of essential
amino-acids, i.e. those that have to be present in the dietary protein.
This list applies to the rat or man but not to birds, for, in general, more
amino-acids are essential in this group. Thus two additional ones are
required by the hen. The addition of the essential dietary amino-acids
to nectar is therefore by no means ensuring that the essential factors are
supplied to the Humming Bird. The hen's list is perhaps nearer but it
is impossible without many years of experimental work to determine a
Humming Bird's list. Therefore, to be safe, all the amino-acids should
be supplied and the best way to do this is by supplying animal protein or
polypeptide chains derived from animal protein. Whilst a partial mixture
of animo-acids may be sufficient, it may not since differences between
groups of animals have been recorded.
We understand that, as Mrs. K. M. Scamell suggests, Gevral Protein
supplies the need fully and can easily be suspended in the nectar whereas j
the food supplied by Mr. Hastings probably contains the essential amino-
acids but may not. Moreover, we are in favour of supplying protein or
polypeptide chains to allow digestion to take place and to keep the digestive
enzymes working fully to deal with the solid (insect) part of protein intake.
Some fat may also &amp;quot;be necessary and in the rat, two fatty-acids linoleic
acid and linolenic acid are essential dietary factors.
One group of substances that receives a great deal of attention is the
vitamins. These play roles in the biochemical processes of the body.
It appears that, originally, vitamins could themselves be synthesized by
the animal from other materials. This ability has been lost in certain
animals and in the wild, dietary sources are usually adequate but inj
confinement it must be ensured that these factors are present in the diet.
As with the essential amino-acids, it is not possible to fully extrapolate
the list of vitamins essential for one group to another. A well-known
example is vitamin C (ascorbic acid). This substance can be synthesized
by most animals but in man, other primates, the guinea-pig and the
dalmatian breed of dog, but not other breeds, vitamin C cannot be produced
and is therefore an essential dietary factor in these types.

M. PEAKER AND STEPHANIE J. PEAKER--FEEDING HUMMING BIRDS 57
Assuming that there is a need for vitamins, then these can easily be
supplied as an essential dietary factor or to supplement the bird's own
production. This does not mean to say that vitamins can be supplied
indiscriminately. Excess vitamins A and D are known to be injurious to
man and many other animals.
Although essential dietary factors must be taken into the animal, in
some cases they need not be ingested as part of the food since bacteria
n the intestine synthesize vitamins which are then absorbed by the bird
n the usual way. In many cases, these vitamins, usually of the B complex
teed only be supplied when the balance between the bacteria and the
inimal is disturbed, after oral antibiotic treatment, for example.
Minerals, some in " trace amounts " are essential and can easily be
upplied as a dietary additive that can be dissolved or suspended in the
lectar.
Finally of course, water is necessary and this, in the wild, can be
&apos;btarned by drinking ram water collected in flowers, from nectar, from the
&amp;gt;ody-fluids of the insect prey and from the utilization of food substances
metabolic water). The ingestion of strong sugar solutions could place a
evere osmotic stress on the bird so it might be beneficial to supply weaker
ectar as well as the usual mixture. Moreover, the latter should not
xceed the concentration of wild nectar. A too strong nectar could result
1 dehydration of the tissues of the bird and could correspond to the
ehydration noted by Mr. Hastings which he states to be due to the
ugar. We would question whether this is due to the sugar per se for
re think that the solution of sugar could have been too strong thus placing
ie bird into a dire osmotic state. In fact, natural nectar exceeds the
rength of the body fluids so that the bird must rely upon absorption and
tihzation of the sugar to leave free water. Absorption is often affected
i sick birds so that any nectar consumed serves to kill the animal by de-
ydration and this would show post mortem rather than a primary cause of
Iness The situation is similar to that of a man drinking sea water,
he sodium chloride cannot be removed by the body to leave osmotically-
ee water. The ill bird cannot remove the sugar from a solution almost
strong as sea water.
The food used by Mrs. Scamell in breeding Violet-eared Humming
irds is ^ rt hy of comment. It consists of a 17% sucrose solution to
ich is added Gevral Protein. This concentrated food contains proteins,
flypeptides and amino-acids in easily assimilable form plus vitamins and
^We are not sure whether Mr. Hastings when writing of sugar is using it to

minerals. Although in part relatively insoluble, it can as Mrs. Scamell
suggests be added to the sugar solution in suspension and ingested
satisfactorily by the animals. The diet is supplemented with Drosophila.
Obviously this food is successful since a Humming Bird has been bred
and reared and theoretically it satisfies the nutritional requirements. We
would be tempted to modify it in one respect to include equal amounts of
glucose and fructose to make a 17% sugar solution rather than sucrose
since nectar contains these two simple sugars exclusively or to a greater
extent than sucrose. Although enzymes exist for sucrose to be broken
down in the alimentary canal, we would prefer to present the carbohydrate
in the form it is received in the wild.
It is very likely that Mr. Hastings' Stimulite nectar food contains
sufficient nutriment but the extra protein provided by Mrs. ScameU's
diet may well be a deciding factor in its favour. Moreover, it should be
remembered that sufficient protein is necessary to allow " breeding
condition " to develop, for it is known that protein-deficiency results in
a decreased output of gonadotrophic hormones from the anterior lobe of
the pituitary gland and these hormones are the ones that induce breeding
in all its aspects. It is important that plenty of protein, in the nectar or
insects should be available at all times and not just when breeding.
Unfortunately, Mr. Hastings' advocacy of his food does not perhaps
match the value of this food. His advertisements and letters have revealed
serious misunderstandings of the physiological basis of nutrition. As we
have attempted to demonstrate, extrapolation from one species or group
to another is extremely difficult and the fact that a food for Humming
Birds is suitable for man does not make it suitable for Humming Birds.
One is tempted to dismiss Mr. Hastings' food on the grounds that the
reasoning on which it is based is open to very severe criticism but there
is no doubt that he has tried and succeeded in making a very acceptable
nectar food for Humming Birds as well as for adding to the food of other
birds. With plenty of Drosophila or other insects, it would, in all
probability, be fully adequate for breeding but if there is any doubt we
would use the Gevral Protein formula, although not exclusively. We are
firm believers in a varied diet to simulate changing feeding patterns in
the wild.
It is obvious that very great advances are now being made in keeping
and breeding Humming Birds. Much praise must go to the importers
who are using modern transport methods. A great deal of effort over
many years has resulted in a number of feeding methods being suitable
at least for their maintenance. What is now needed is a critical appraisal
of all aspects of Humming Bird care to try to elucidate the important
factors in their maintenance and breeding but such appraisals are com-
plicated enough without being the subject of dogmatic statements and
misquoted, ill-informed facts.

Since coming into possession of this pair of Key-West Quail Doves
some five years ago, I have on several occasions reported their breeding
behaviour in this Magazine. Each year heretofore the pair has been
rather prolific, raising a number of youngsters to maturity. The young-
sters rarely breed before they are two years old. This fact has been
confirmed by the several fanciers to whom pairs of young, but reasonably
mature, specimens have been sold. It is interesting to note that whenever
two youngsters have been raised to maturity, they turn out to be male and
female, and they seem to become inseparable, staying together during the
day and roosting side by side at night, even though showing no sexual
tendencies, such as cooing or even mating, for the first six months.
Youngsters of Key-West Quail Doves may safely be left with the parent
birds for some months after leaving the nest, both parties getting along
splendidly, even in a rather small pen. The fact that this particular
species, at least my breeding pair, is extremely tame has greatly facilitated
my observations of their various activities. The breeding pair now under
consideration has not been kept with any other kind of doves, sharing a
pen with a few medium-sized softbills, of which I keep quite a number.
In appraising these birds' behaviour, one should keep in mind that they
live in a rather mild climate, which may, at least in part, be responsible

deserting nest and eggs soon after laying, and also in laying but one egg
to a setting quite often, is due to age or to continual breeding, even though
rest periods were given on several occasions. It is worthwhile noting
that this pair has been in continuous breeding condition while under
Dbservation, the male bird flitting his wingtips and cooing and displaying
aefore his mate, and both birds being almost constantly in or about the
nesting-box. The food given them has not varied during the entire
neriod, the birds showing a preference for popcorn and diced longhorn
;heese, taking but little millet, milo, and various mixed grass-seeds.
So mealworms were eaten. It is, of course, difficult to say to what extent
dimatic conditions have affected their behaviour.

MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS ON BIRDS
[N ZURICH ZOO, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE
TO BREEDING ACTIVITIES

We had great hopes that 1967 would be as successful as 1966, which
vas so far the best year for the bird department of the Zurich Zoo. This
)roved to be true, despite some disappointments.
The first open-fronted flight aviary of Europe was built in 1954 at the
Zurich Zoo. Some sixty birds representing twenty-one different species
rom all the continents are living there.
One of the most interesting species is the Tinamou (Rhynchotus
ufescens). Unfortunately we received only a single specimen. However
t joined a lonely European Curlew ( Numenius arquata, already living
ixteen years in Zurich Zoo), which--for human eyes--resembles it most
f all the birds living in that aviary. The Tinamou followed the Curlew
very where for some weeks. Since the Curlew didn't show any reactions
owards it, the Tinamou ceased to be interested in the Curlew&apos;.
The Tinamou laid eggs scattered around in the aviary on 30th March,

average measurement is 57 by 46 millimetres, the largest measuring
59 by 47 millimetres, and the smallest measuring 54 by 45 millimetres.
Another lonesome bird in the same aviary is a male Carolina Dove
(Zenaida m. macroura). It carries out its courtship display (cooing, see
Goodwin, 1966) often some fifteen centimetres in front of the female
Tinamou. It was even once observed mounting on the Tinamou's back
and trying to copulate with the much larger Tinamou!
A group of Common Rheas ( Rhea americana) is kept in a grassy enclosure
all the year round. Some trees just outside the yard cannot be reached
by the Rheas because the twigs are too high. However, one female Rhea
was seen several times jumping off the ground some twenty centimetres
(leaving the ground with both feet simultaneous) to browse.
The European White Storks ( Ciconia ciconia) reared young for the
first time for many years. One pair laid five eggs on 26th, 28th, 30th
March, 1st and 4th April, 1967, respectively. Two young ones hatched
on 7th May, a third on 8th May and a fourth on 9th May. The latter--
which was weak--died three days later. The others were raised success-
fully. Another pair laid eggs on 2nd and 4th April. By 9th April there
were four eggs in the nest and on 1 ith April a fifth was laid. Four young
from this clutch hatched on 15th May, and all were raised.
When anyone approached the nest at two weeks the young Storks
showed immobility. Wackernagel (1967) observed the same phenomen
at an age of four weeks. When the Storks were three weeks old they
started standing on their legs. At the age of three-and a-half weeks they
left the nest for the first time together with their parents.
In our colony of Cattle Egrets ( Bubulcus i. ibis )--which is kept with
rhinos and hippos in the Africa-house (Schmidt, 1967)--we noted eggs
from 1 st February until 26th August, 1967. In March and May three
young hatched. However, they disappeared after some days as also did
many of the eggs. The reason for this is not clear. We failed to raise
artificially a young Egret hatched on 7th May.
We are keeping one male and two female White Ibises ( Eudocimus albus)
in the open-fronted flight aviary. We supplement their food with
Canthaxantin (F. Hoffmann la Roche &amp; Co. Ltd., Basle, Switzerland)
because two Scarlet Ibises ( E . ruber) and two male Orange Cocks-of-the-
Rock are living in the same aviary. The male White Ibis showed a
reaction to that carotinoid as it became pinkish while (Kornerup and
Wanscher, 1961, colour A 2 of plate 7 ). It arrived in 1964 in brown
youth plumage and now still has some dark feathers on the head. During
April and the first half of May, 1967, all five Ibises developed for the first
time a full skin-sac below the base of the bill. It was much larger in the
male White Ibis (Illustration 1) than in the other specimens. During the
same time it showed some nesting activity, but was disturbed by the
two scarlet specimens. The sac became empty in the middle of May,
but was still visible until it disappeared in July.

The same pair of Screamers ( Chauna torquata) mentioned by Hediger
and Bucher (1964) bred again in 1964. Eggs were deposited in the same
nest on an islet as in 1963 on 5th May, 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th July, 1964,
respectively. On 20th August two chicks hatched. They swam to the
shore for the first time on their fourth day. Up to September they spent
the nights on the islet. One of the chicks died on 2nd October of acute
pneumonia. Its weight was 650 grammes. The other one died some
days earlier. In 1965 the same pair laid the first egg on 5th April--still
in the heated winter quarter. Further eggs were noted on nth April,
1965, 25th and 26th May, 1966, on the same site as in the previous years.
All these eggs proved to be infertile as well as an especially small one laid
on 6th June, 1967. It might be that this pair is now too old for breeding.
In East Africa one can often observe Egyptian Geese ( Alopochen
aegyptiacus) and River Hippos ( Hippopotamus amphibius) living closely
together, side by side, in the same lakes. We therefore tried to introduce
a pair of Egyptian Geese--long residents of the zoo--into the outside
hippo-enclosure. However, the young adult, zoo-born, female Hippo
killed the female goose immediately after introduction. The gander was
then removed from the enclosure.
Two pairs of Griffon Vultures ( Gyps fulvus) produced eggs on 23rd
January and 6th February, 1967, respectively. The first pair incubated
the egg for forty-six days. Then the egg vanished. Another egg was
laid thirty-three days later on 23rd April. It was placed in the electric
incubator, but proved to be infertile. The egg of the other pair dis-
appeared after an incubation period of twenty days. A second egg was
laid thirty-six days later, on 3rd April, which again was infertile. Both
parents shared in brooding. According to Jonch (1966) the incubation
period for this species in Barcelona Zoo was sixty days, and eggs were
laid in January.
A pair of Golden Eagles ( Aquila chrysaetos) produced two eggs by 24th
March, 1966, which disappeared some days later. In 1967 two eggs were
observed on 2nd April which were incubated until 28th May when we
found only some portions of the eggshell.
In 1965 Zurich Zoo bought a pair of Satyr Tragopan ( Tragopan satyr a)
bred the same year in Germany. In the first half of April, 1967, the
cock showed for the first time its beautiful courtship display--only in the
morning not later than 9 a.m.
A pair of Demoiselle Cranes [Anthropoides virgo) produced infertile
eggs on 9th and 12th May, 1967. They were incubated for forty-three
days; that is quite remarkable because the normal incubation time lasts
only twenty-seven to twenty-eight days (Moody cited by Makatsch, 1959).
A female Red and Green Macaw (Ara chloroptera ) paired with a Blue
and Yellow Macaw [Ara ararauna) laid two eggs, 3rd and 5th May, 1967,
in a barrel. They were crushed four days later. Hybridization between
these two species is quite common in zoos (Hill, 1947; Lang and Stamm,
1956; Haas 1964, 1965; Muller, 1966, 1967).

In 1962 we purchased one male and three female Snowy Owls (Nyctea
scandiaca). Two of the females--bred the same year (Poulsen, 1963)--
were kindly donated by the Copenhagen Zoo. The first two eggs were
noted 25th May, 1965. Five eggs were laid in May, 1966. Two females
crouched in sandy depressions only half a metre apart. Both deserted
their nest-sites after heavy rain. No young ones hatched that year. In
1967 the females chose another nest-site on the highest part of the aviary.
All three were sitting side by side in close contact. Throughout the
month of May, 1967, many eggs were produced in two of the nest depres-
sions. However, in June one of the females was seen feeding on a broken
egg. Therefore, the remaining five eggs were put in the electric incubator.
Owlets hatched on 25th, 26th June (hatching weight 45 grammes). 3rd July
(hatching weight 45 grammes) and 7th July (hatching weight 40 grammes).
The three younger birds died after a few days. The first owlet was raised
artificially with great success. Its growth-rate is shown in Figure 1. It

was fed the first three days exclusively on bloody intestines and meat of
mice. Later its diet consisted of minced mice, ox-heart and liver
supplemented with Vionate (E. R. Squibb &amp; Sons, New York). The
owlet first opened its eyes at the age of six days--although it still kept
them closed much of the time. The first pellet was regurgitated one day
later. At an age of ten days it took some pieces of meat by itself for the
first time. The change of the dark-spotted youth plumage into the pure
white male plumage started on the head and throat at the end of Septem-
ber, 1967. At the end of November its belly, wings and tail were still
spotted.

We obtained two pairs of Striated Colies (Colius striatus) from the well-
known specialist Dr. H. Schifter, Vienna. They were kept for some years
in a small inside aviary (2 by 1*5 metres by i*8 metres high) where they
showed no attempt to breed. However, after being released into the large
open-fronted flight aviary both pairs reared altogether six young ones in
April, July and October, 1967. One pair chose as nest-site a wire basket
attached on the ceiling below a ventilation hole. The brooding Coly held
its long tail straight upwards because that nest was so small. Compre-
hensive studies on the reproductive behaviour of Colies were undertaken
by Lint (1963) and Schifter (1963, 1965).
A pair of Kookaburras (Dacelo gigas ) was purchased in 1957. Eggs
were laid on 15th April, 1963, nth March, 1964, February, 1st, 2nd and
5th April, and August, 1965. All these eggs were infertile or the embryos
died in the egg.
Copulation was observed on 16th January, 1966. Eggs were laid on
29th and 31st January into a hollow tree placed high in a corner of the
inside aviary. A young one hatched on 24th February. It was killed
the next day by the inexperienced male. It obviously regarded its
young as prey and hit it as these birds do with mice. Wackernagel (1963)
reports that the same happened in an inexperienced pair with their first
offspring in Basel Zoo. Further eggs were laid in the same box on 12th
and 14th March. One young hatched on 5th April, 1966. However,
it broke its legs which was not noted. It was euthanized because the
fracture healed incorrectly. Three more eggs were noted by 7th June.
They turned out to be infertile.
Next egg-laying took place on 7th, 8th and 10th February, 1967,
respectively. Three young ones hatched after an incubation period of
twenty-four days for each young one. Both parents fed them with baby
mice. Two of the young birds weighed 250 and 330 grammes respectively
on 21st March (Illustration No. 2). They were not able to do any sound
until an age of twenty-five days. The weight of one was then 400 grammes
in comparison to 320 grammes of the Basel chick at about the same age
(Wackernagel, op. cit.). At the age of thirty-two days one still weighed
400 grammes and produced already some kind of " laughing ". The young
Kookaburra in the Basel Zoo " laughed " for the first time when it was
introduced to the bird house at an age of forty days (Wackernagel, op. cit.).
It might be that this artificially-raised bird had no opportunity to hear
the " laughing " of adults and therefore wasn't able to learn these sounds
earlier. The oldest of our three young ones left the nest-box for the
first time at an age of thirty-five days. On 9th April two of the young
Laughing Jackass left the nesting-tree. Already on nth, 13th and 15th
April, respectively, the next clutch of eggs--though infertile--was laid.
The three young ones were removed from the aviary in May because they
were chased by their parents. On 19th and 20th July the second brood
hatched in the same hollow tree. They opened their eyes at an age of

fifteen days which is nearly the same as the two weeks recorded in the
Basel chick (Wackernagel, op. cit.). They left the nest-box when they
were thirty-five days old. Afterwards the adult pair and one offspring
were sleeping in close contact on the same branch every night. The other
young one was sleeping somewhere apart. The adult female started to
attack the male quite severely in the middle of October. Therefore the
two young ones were removed. The female continued its attacks on the
male until they were separated.
The partners of our breeding pair have different coloured eyes: the male
having brown and the female greyish eyes. All three young of the first
and one of the second clutch also have brown eyes. However, the other
specimen of the second clutch has the same greyish-eyes as its mother.
One should know more material to be sure that this is actually a sexual
and not an individual difference.
Breeding data of the Kookaburra in captivity is quite well known from
observations made in the Zoological Gardens of Basel (Wackernagel,
1963), San Diego (Lint, 1962), Washington (Widman and Vorous, 1962)
and Zurich. In these four zoos of the Northern hemisphere egg-laying
took place in every month from January until August. We can conclude
from the papers mentioned above and from my own observations that the
usual clutch consists of two to three eggs laid on successive days or at
intervals of one to three days. Incubation period varies from twenty-three
(San Diego) to twenty-six days (Basel). Fledglings leave the nest-box at
the earliest in thirty days (San Diego) and at the latest in thirty-six days
(Basel).
Literally nothing seems to have been published on the breeding of the
Rothschild's Mynah (Leucopsar rothschildi). In the years of 1963 and
1964 we got three males and one female of this beautiful white starling
from the Island of Bali. They were always kept together, first in an
outside aviary and later in the open-fronted flight aviary.
Three young ones hatched after an incubation period of twelve days on
15th April, 1965. However, they all died as well as those hatched in
June of the same year, perhaps due to insufficient feeding. On 4th May,
1966, two young hatched in a nest-box. They left it for the first time at
an age of twenty-eight days and were eventually sold to another zoo.
Four young hatched on 19th July and on 7th September (after an incuba-
tion period of only ten days), respectively. Two of both broods dis-
appeared some days after hatching. One of two fledglings hatched on
17th February, 1967, was still being fed by its parents when again four
chicks hatched on 7th April. They all died although the older fledgling
was removed. Another clutch of four eggs was laid on 4th June by the
same female but they failed to hatch and no more breeding activity was
seen since--except the courtship display which can be observed every
day (see illustrations). It seems that the clutch of the Rothschild's
Mynah is normally composed of four eggs, however, usually only two of
the nestlings are raised successfully.

For several years we had tried to obtain the Australian Brolga Crane
(Grus rubicunda ) but in spite of all our efforts it was only in October, 1967,
that we succeeded in getting a pair of this species which is seldom seen
in European Zoos. After having purchased six Hooded Cranes (Grus
monacha) in March, we were able to buy another six of these rare birds.
They all share a vast enclosure with a group of Lesser Sandhill Cranes
and make a wonderful exhibit. In December we acquired in exchange a
fine female White-naped Crane (Grus vipio) as a mate for our single male.
In our crane collection now only two species of fourteen are lacking:
the Whooping Crane and the Black-necked Crane. In order to facilitate
the breeding of cranes we have begun to construct special breeding
enclosures. They are situated in a part of the Zoo which is not very
much frequented by the public, and will be densely planted with bushes
so that the birds will be undisturbed.
Four Guanay Cormorants were released in the enclosure of our huge
male Elephant Seal. At the very beginning they were somewhat afraid
of their neighbour but now they are getting accustomed to him. The
seal so far never tried to disturb the birds.
During the last four months of 1967, the following birds were purchased:

been prevalent in this area. Due to the closure we restricted the move-
ment of birds and therefore no new arrivals were received during this
period. Since re-opening, we have been presented with a Senegal and
an African Grey Parrot.

Many additions were counted among the Cordon Bleus and Orange-
cheeked Waxbills; it was obvious that they had bred but due to the size
of the building, their nesting activities had gone unobserved. At the
Stocktaking we accounted for 924 birds of 261 species--a slight increase
in numbers but a slight drop in species, compared with last year's figures.
During 1967 a number of species have bred, notably Sclater's Crested
Curassows and Hill Mynahs. Other species to successfully rear young
included Bar-headed, Emperor and Barnacle Geese, Indian White-eyes,
i^caly-breasted Lorikeets, Great Eagle-Owls and Barraband Parrakeets.

Four sub-species new to the collection have been presented during
December and January. These are a Philippine Night Heron ( Nycticorax
zaledonicus manillensis ), a Philippine Rail (Rallus t. torquatus) and a
White-throated Kingfisher ( Halcyon smyrnensis gularis) brought from
Manila by Mrs. J. Laloe who also brought a Philippine Oriole ( Oriolus c.
zhinensis ) and two Grey-backed Coletos (, Sarcops c. calvus). A Black-
browned Jay (Garrulus glandarius atricapillus) from the Lebanon is also a
new sub-species.
A Royal Starling ( Cosmopsarus regius) has been presented by Mr.
R. G. Kirkham and other arrivals of particular interest are a Booted
Eagle, two female Capercaillie, a pair of Rose-crested or Moluccan
Sockatoos and a Lady Ross's Turaco.
The cockatoos are not tame and are devoted to one another, so there
should be a good chance of breeding from them.
Black-footed Penguins, Cereopsis Geese and Javan Fish-Owls are
lesting and another Speckled Pigeon has been bred. The pair of Pigmy
Falcons that nested last spring (one egg being seen in the nest) appear to
)e nesting again now.

Trollope described the breeding of the Bustard Quail (Turnix suscitator).
In a recent letter he writes: "A second brood of two have been successfully
reared. Unlike the first breeding, I left the hen with the cock and chicks,
and she played a part in rearing them, calling them for insects, etc. Both
the chicks are hens and are now in full adult plumage. They are still
with the parents with no sign of trouble so far ".

compared with the forty-three that flew north to their breeding grounds
in the Wood Buffalo National Park, Canada, in the spring. This means
that there were nine young birds of the year. A recent report says that
one of the Aransas birds has died from gun-shot wounds. Six eggs were
collected from the wild flock and flown to the U.S. Patuxent Wildlife
Research Center, Maryland. From these four young ones were hatched

Carter Bundy conceived the idea of establishing the Scarlet Ibis
(Eudocinius ruber ) in Florida. If the White E. albus could live there, why
not the closely related Scarlet? Surely it was just a matter of taking a
few fertile eggs from one of the South American nesting sites and putting
them under brooding Whites? And so, with the co-operation of David
Moore, then Conservator of Forests and Chief Game Warden of Trinidad,
twenty-four Scarlet Ibis eggs were sent to him in North Miami Beach,
in July, 1961. Carter Bundy substituted them for an equal number of
White Ibis eggs in eleven nests in Greynolds Park. Within two weeks
seventeen of the Trinidad eggs hatched--at least four young ones survived.
In 1963, two of the Scarlets mated but hatched no young. Later, all
four mated with Whites and, eventually, two Scarlet-White pairs produced
a total of three young. The following year three nestings occurred. One
involved paired Scarlet birds and two involved Scarlet-White pairs.
Only two young from these matings survived the summer, and they
disappeared before it was possible to see what colour they became. In
1965 there were three Scarlet-White nestings and one Scarlet-Scarlet,
with a total production of six young. Then in the spring, 1966, a pink
Ibis was seen to be building a nest with a White mate: and a few days
later a richly salmon-coloured bird, also mated to a White one, appeared
in another part of the rookery: " The two were not immature; pink and
salmon were their permanent adult colors ". In 1967 one of the hybrids
mated with a White and two chicks were produced. The experiment has
been an undoubted success and Carter Bundy intends repeating it, if
possible on a larger scale. The foregoing is condensed from " New

volumes. Dover Publications, New York, 1967. Price $2.50 per
volume.
It is nearly a century since the last of the octavo editions of Audubon's
great work appeared in 1871, and all interested in ornithology and avicul-
ture will welcome the appearance of this new edition and at such a reason-
able price. The original edition of Birds of America , known as the elephant
folio edition, was described by Baron Cuvier as "the greatest monument ever
erected by Man to Nature ", and with its wonderful illustrations and very
limited edition of less than two hundred copies it is a valuable treasure
only to be seen in the larger museums and libraries. But even the black
and white illustrations to Audubon's original text emphasize the superiority
of art in giving a living impression of the birds he describes. Audubon's
literary style eventually became as animated and picturesque as his
illustrations, but as Dean Amadon remarks his memory occasionally
played him false in writing years later without the specimen before him.
The introduction to this Dover edition is written by Dean Amadon,
Lamont Curator of Birds, American Museum of Natural History, and
new indices have been specially compiled for this by John Bull, also of the
American Museum of Natural History. The common, and also the
scientific names of many of the birds have changed since Audubon
completed his work and these two new indices will be of great assistance
to the reader. In the first index the birds are arranged alphabetically by
the common name used by Audubon followed by the scientific name he
ised and then, within brackets, the current common and scientific names.
In the second index the birds are arranged alphabetically by their current
tommon names, followed by their current scientific names and then,
Adthin brackets, the corresponding names used by Audubon. The indices
vill greatly help the reader of this new reprint of Audubon's important
ext which is likely to remain the standard work on the subject for many

NUTRITION OF HUMMING BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998714857142857" page_id="58089039"  page_num="74" year="" vol="">
I read with much interest the three letters in the January/February number of
the Magazine on Humming Birds and nectar-drinkers and I would like to thank
Mr. Spilsbury for his very kind comments. How I wish I could condense my
views on nutrition in such a balanced and unbiassed way as Mr. Harrison! How-
ever it seems from Mr. Hasting's letter that I am asked to answer so many questions
on so many matters that I hope you will allow me the space to do so.
Regarding the first two questions raised (where did I obtain my first Humming
Birds and why did I not exhibit Humming Birds before 1962) like several other
aviculturists and bird fanciers since the War, I bought my first Humming Birds
from other dealers (Kingston's of Springfield Ltd. for one) and from private
sources via the Continent in the early 1950's before Mr. Hastings re-opened his
business. This I believe, was in 1953 and before he again advertised Humming
Birds for sale, which I think was in 1954. I kept Humming Birds some time before
I exhibited them but reference to the National Exhibition of Cage Birds Show
Catalogue for 1952 (ten years earlier than the date Mr. Hastings mentions in his
letter) &amp; will disclose that four Humming Birds were entered that year including
one of mine. I also showed a Humming Bird in other shows in 1952 including,
I recall, Beccles and Great Yarmouth where I was living at the time. I entered
Humming Birds in five other National Shows prior to 1962 and in many other
shows. In 1953 in particular I exhibited these birds at Felixstowe, Ipswich,
Norwich and Scunthorpe. Humming Birds are not the easiest of birds to take to
bird shows, particularly if these are any distance and I restricted my exhibits of
these birds to a few shows only in any year.
Mr Hastings is again mistaken in suggesting I purchased a hen Violet-eared
Humming Bird from him " in the fall of 1965 " and that I bred from it. The
only Violet-eared Humming Bird I ever bought from him was on the 17th June,
1962. We tried to pair this bird with a cock of ours of the same species, but the
male would not tolerate it and we had to separate them before the newcomer was
injured. We sold this presumed hen to a friend very shortly afterwards. It
would have been a very old Humming Bird to have bred five years later!
On the matter of nutrition, I don't profess to be an expert. I stated the food I
find the most suitable for nectar-drinkers kept under the outdoor conditions
described in my previous letter. I am fully aware that no Humming Bird will live
on sugar alone for very long and that they require vitamins, minerals and proteins
to help balance their diet. In the case of my Humming Birds and other nectar-
drinkers (except lories which I have never kept) the vitamins, minerals and proteins
are supplied by the Gevral-Protein plus whatever fruit flies and other minute
insects they can catch on the wing and these are precious few in the winter months.
It is no good, therefore, belittling the nutritional value of the Gevral-Protein food
supplied and as Mr. Hastings has set out the analysis of molasses (which I presume
is one of the main ingredients in Stimulite Nectar Food), I hope I shall be allowed
to give a similar fair hearing to Gevral-Protein. My container label reads.

Whether the above vitamins, minerals and proteins exactly meet the needs of all
&amp;gt;pecies of Humming Birds, I don't know. The nectar formula is not mine and
was prepared by a scientist who has kept Humming Birds for about 40 years and
tias spent much of that time studying the nutritional requirements of these birds.
He assured me only a few months ago that at the moment, in his opinion, the nectar
formula I am using is the best available and from the general results I am getting,
I am quite satisfied.
Unfortunately, in December last, I lost the young Violet-eared Humming Bird
bred last March; it was almost 9 months old but had been in full breeding condition
for some time. I thought I would try and breed from it and placed within its
sight and hearing a newly purchased bird which I think is a hen. It is, of course,
of the same species. Shortly afterwards I found the young bird dead on the grass
floor of its aviary. It had never a moment's illness in its short life and as I wanted
to find the cause of its sudden death, I sent it at once to a veterinary surgeon I
know for a post-mortem. His report from which I quote said: " He (the Violet-
eared Humming Bird) was in perfect condition and I could find no sign of injury.
The cause of death was rupture of the right atrium of the heart ". I have dis-
cussed this with several avicultural friends since and have been told it is not
unusual to have fatalities of this sort with certain species of birds when in full
breeding condition. We had a similar case with a cock Minivet two summers ago,
the bird which we had had two years without a hen died instantly when we did
introduce one to its aviary.
Finally, I would say I am not the slightest bit interested in wagers of any sort,
nor do I wish to get involved in the experiments Mr. Hastings suggests; my
avicultural interests are much simpler. However, if Mr. Hastings wants to have
feeding trials carried out, let him go ahead; I am sure no one wants to stop him!

'STIMULITE' NECTAR FOOD is a COMPLETE NUTRI-
TIONAL food in highly concentrated form. It is highly
beneficial to all livestock, whether it be Humming Birds,
Sun Birds or other Nectarines, Insectivorous Birds, Fruit-
eaters, Canaries, Finches, Parrakeets, Parrots, or any kind
of animal. This supreme food should be available to
them at all times.
Recently there has been some advocacy of a sugar and protein diet for
Humming Birds, such a diet is very deficient in nutritional value.
PROTEIN is produced within the body by METABOLISM from the
nutrients in the food consumed. A diet, to be fully nutritional, has to
contain all the essential vitamins, A, D, E, C, and the full vitamin B
Complex, Bl, B2, B6, B12 (known as the animal-protein factor), the full
context contains Thiamin, Riboflavine, Nicotinic Acid, Pantothenic Acid.
Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Inositol, Choline and Biotin. Only a food
containing all of these can be termed COMPLETE.
Metabolism can only convert the food into protein if the food also
contains the following amino acids : Arginine, Histidine, Lysine,
Trypotophane, Phenylalanine, Methionine, Leucine, Isoleucine and
Valine. All these factors are necessary for a fully nutritional food, they
are not heresay, but SCIENTIFIC FACTS which can be verified.

the leading Doctors and Nutritionists, including Prof. Grzimek, of
Frankfurt Zoo, probably the world's leading zoologist; Dr. Samuel H.
Tucker, head of the Children's Hospital, Philadelphia; Dr. Giuseppe

(Lophura swinhoei)
By Philip Wayre (The Ornamental Pheasant Trust, Norfolk, England.)
Two species of pheasant, the Mikado (Syrmaticus mikado) and Swinhoe's
(Lophura swinhoei ) are unique to the Island of Taiwan (Formosa) and
both are considered to be in danger of extinction in the wild.
Swinhoe's Pheasant was discovered in 1862 by the English naturalist
Robert Swinhoe, at one time Consul in Taiwan. Despite several hazardous
journeys into the interior of the Central Mountain range, Swinhoe did
not succeed in seeing this pheasant alive in its natural habitat, although
he obtained skins from the aborigines. At that time these people were
still taking human scalps and their presence added to the problems of
travelling in the extremely rugged, wild and steep jungle with frequent
torrential rainstorms. Conditions are no better today except that the
aborigines are no longer hostile.
In 1959 two pairs of Swinhoe's Pheasants which had recently been
imported from Taiwan were presented to the Ornamental Pheasant
Trust at Great Witchingham by Mr. Arthur Prestwich. They were
probably the first birds to reach Europe alive since the original importa-
tion in 1866 and they provided a welcome change of blood. Since then
over 150 Swinhoe's Pheasants have been bred by the Trust, and in 1963
negotiations were started with the Government of Taiwan for sending a
number of birds for release in their native habitat to reinforce the depleted
wild population.
Preliminary arrangements for sending the first consignment of 30 birds
were made on behalf of the Trust by the British Section of the International
Council for Bird Preservation. Six pairs were to be released in a suitable
area of the Central Mountain range where this species still occurs in the
wild and the remainder were to be retained in captivity to form the
nucleus of the island's own captive breeding programme.
The birds were flown to Taiwan in April 1967, with the help of a
generous grant from the World Wildlife Fund and from two other
organizations. My wife and I arrived in Taipei at the same time to super-
vise their release and advise the Taiwan authorities on the captive breed-
ing programme so that further young birds would become available for
release to reinforce the wild population.

The pheasants were transferred from Taipei to the release pen, but as
they would need at least three weeks to become accustomed to their new
surroundings before it would be safe to set them free, we continued our
wildlife investigations. One of the first places we visited was the tourist
resort of Sun Moon Lake; many of the shops were full of stuffed birds
and mammals since these are popular household ornaments both in Japan
and in Taiwan. Animals caught all over the island are sent to Taipei for
mounting but the majority end up for sale at Sun Moon Lake. Here the
visitor can take his pick from mounted Barking Deer (Muntjac), Giant
Red Flying Squirrels, White-headed Flying Squirrels, Ferret Badgers,
Pangolins and a wide variety of birds, including colourful Minivets,
Orioles, Fairy Pittas, Blue Pies, Bulbuls, Barbets, White-throated
Laughing Thrushes, Shrikes, Sibias, Grass Owls, Serpent Eagles and
even a few Swinhoe's Pheasants. The volume of the slaughter is horrible
to contemplate and this trade is clearly an unnecessary drain on the
wildlife of Taiwan.
Much of the island's wildlife ends up in the medicine shops of the
cities, because the Chinese believe in the medicinal or aphrodisiac qualities
of many species. Pangolins or Scaly Anteaters are hunted for their
scales, dried Sea Horses and Turtles are also in demand, other " remedies "
include the dried foetus of the Sambar, while the antler of the Sambar,
sawn off whilst in velvet, is a valued aphrodisiac though not considered
as effective as Rhino horn.
No European had ever seen Swinhoe's Pheasant in the wild and our
search for this bird finally took us to the aborigine village of Chulu,
where the chief promised to take me to a remote part of the mountain
behind his village to look for the pheasants.
On 18th May I met Chief Ho an hour before dawn and accompanied
by two of his men and three small hunting dogs we set off into the
mountains. All the men had guns, one of them home-made and the
others manufactured in Taiwan. They were single barelled, smooth bore
and about 20 gauge taking brass cartridges which could be re-loaded by
the hunters. The charge was lead shot of various sizes and the wadding
was rammed newspaper. In addition one of the men carried three large
steel traps for deer while the Chief had a bag containing some 200 snares
for pheasants. Normally a hunting trip of this kind lasts several days
and the men bivouac at night beneath rough bamboo shelters.
The jungle was dense with rich sub-tropical vegetation, creepers, tree
ferns and lily-like plants with huge glaucous leaves. The climb was very
steep and for some way the path, little more than J metre wide, ran along
the edge of a gorge with a sheer drop of over 100 metres to the river
below. There was considerable precipitation on the vegetation and the
path was often wet and slippery. Leeches were numerous and we stopped
every twenty minutes to pull them off our legs; the aborigines scraped
theirs off with sharp panga-type knives which they used to cut their wa&amp;gt;

dirough the vegetation. Our goal was a certain area where the Chief
&amp;gt;aid we ought to find Swinhoe's Pheasant and, after a gruelling six hour
:limb we reached it. A huge fallen tree covered with spongey moss lay
across the path, the undergrowth was waist high, but less impenetrable,
and a green light filtered through the tree canopy overhead. We were
steaming hot and soaked to the skin with sweat and water which dripped
off the trees and bushes. The three little hunting dogs began to work
the mountainside and within half an hour had flushed seven Swinhoe's
Pheasants, which were probably members of one family group as they
were all found in a comparatively small area. Chief Ho explained that
the pheasants came here at this time of year to feed on the nut-like fruits
of a certain tree.
None of the aborigines was able to get a shot at the pheasants as they
hurtled downhill between the trees and despite all the efforts of the little
dogs, no more were seen. The altitude was approximately 800 metres.
Other mammals seen were the Formosan Red-bellied Tree Squirrel
(Callosciurus erythraeus centralis ), Formosan Macaque ( Macaca cyclopis)
and Formosan Muntjac ( Muntiacus reevesi micrurus). Birds included the
Formosan Serpent Eagle ( Spilornis cheela hoya), Formosan Lesser Coucal
(Centropus bengalensis lignator), Formosan Tree-pie ( Crypsirina formosae
formosae ) and the Formosan Bamboo Partridge ( Bambusicola thoracica
sonorivox), the latter at 200 metres in a bamboo grove.
The steel traps used for catching deer are also used by the aborigines
for taking monkeys which they eat. The men showed us a rocky cliff
across the gorge where they told us they trapped the monkeys (Formosan
Macaques) which gather here during the rains. In a nearby village we
saw a Macaque chained to a tree outside a shop, one front leg had been
amputated at the elbow, presumably in a similar trap.
The snares used by the aborigines to catch pheasants and partridges are
simple but effective. The noose is made of thin cord and is held open
by a sliver of bamboo (17 cms. long for partridges, 23 cms. long for
pheasants) to one end of which the noose is tied, the loop then passes
through a notch in the other end of the sliver and hangs beneath it. The
bamboo is also the trigger, for it is attached to a strong sapling bent over
to act as a spring holding the sliver in place beneath a notch cut in a peg
which has been hammered into the ground. The snare is almost invisible
when set across a pheasant run and when a bird puts its head through
the noose it dislodges the bamboo sliver and the sapling then whips it up
into the air, where it hangs by its neck. Needless to say, most of the
pheasants caught by this method are dead by the time the hunters find
them.
From our enquiries, it appears that Swinhoe's Pheasant is generally,
but thinly, distributed in the central mountain range behind Taitung.
This is a very large area, much of which is almost inaccessible. If the
aborigines could be prevented from shooting or snaring it the future of

this species would seem to be reasonably secure, unless the human
population increases to such an extent that the habitat is destroyed by
felling and clearing the jungle.
On our return to Hsitou to supervise the release of the pheasants we
were told that following our conversations with Governor Huang Cheh
he had decided to ask the Government to pass a new law giving full
protection to the Swinhoe's Pheasant. Even if this results only in stop-
ping the trade in skins and live birds it will do much to safeguard the
species in its remote mountain home.
The latest news from Taiwan is that the Government has recently
extended legal protection to more than forty species of mammals and
birds in the island, including the Swinhoe's Pheasant. Meanwhile our
birds have settled down well in their new home and the operation appears
to have every chance of success. Plans are being made to send a second
consignment of young Swinhoe's for release in the same area in the near
future.
The Trust is at present working on a similar project to reinforce the
small wild population of the very rare Mikado Pheasant in Taiwan. Work
has also begun on a scheme to reintroduce the Cheer Pheasant to its
original range in the N.W. Himalayas, where, it too, is threatened with
extinction. Preliminary negotiations with the Government of Himachal
Pradesh are already under way and it is hoped to send the first consign-
ment of young birds within the next two years.
The immediate practical results of these operations demonstrate the
value of aviculture in helping to save threatened species. However, it
may well be that the side effects are of even greater importance if they
succeed in calling the attention of governments concerned to the plight
of their native wildlife and thus cause them to take action, as has already
been done in the case of Taiwan. In some cases legislation, even if it
becomes law, may be difficult to enforce, but it is a step in the right
direction and one which will ultimately determine the future of much of
the world's wildlife.

By J. R. Hodges (Pinner, Middlesex, England)
Of the four species of the genus Cyanoramphus two have recently
Decome well known to European aviculturists. These are the Red-
:ronted or Red-crowned New Zealand Parrakeet ( Cyanoramphus
tovaezelandiae) and the smaller Yellow-fronted or Yellow-crowned
species (C. auriceps).
The Yellow-fronted species was represented in some of the larger
:ollections in Europe before the war. It was reputed to be a prolific
Dreeder but not very long lived in captivity. Many years previously the
Red-fronted Parrakeet was a comparatively common aviary bird but it is
doubtful if there were any specimens at all in Europe from 1914 until a
pear or two ago. At one time both species were common New Zealand
Mid birds, but their unpopularity with farmers led to their relentless
persecution almost to the point of extinction. Recently the position has
improved and now the Red-fronted species is well established on many
New Zealand coastal and outlying islands, where it breeds in hollow trees
and some times in rock crevices. The Yellow-fronted species occurs in
fair numbers on the mainland in both the North and South Islands. For
many years it was an offence in New Zealand to keep any species of native
bird in captivity but about ten years ago the authorities recognised the
part that aviculture could play in conserving species threatened with
extinction. Accordingly the Department of Internal Affairs issued to
several individuals permits to keep C. auriceps and C. novaezelandiae
provided that their aviaries were considered satisfactory and of suitable
size and were open to occasional inspection. The experiment has been a
great success and during the past ten years rapidly increasing numbers
of both species have been bred annually. Some of the progeny found
their way to Australian aviaries where they also became firmly established
and presumably it is from this source that most of the specimens now in
Europe have originated.
I obtained a magnificent pair of Red-fronted Parrakeets in June 1967.
They are much bigger than I expected, the cock being larger than an
average sized Rosella Parrakeet and the hen not much smaller. Their
general colour is a lovely deep shade of green. The forehead, crown and
a stripe from the forehead extending to a patch behind the eye are crimson.
There is also a patch of the same colour on each side of the rump. The
primaries are violet-blue. The upper and lower mandibles are bluish-
grey, darker at the tips. They have long sturdy legs and feet which they
use with great dexterity for scratching, holding and running. They are
extremely active and have a direct and rapid flight. They look partic-
ularly attractive when, with their tails spread like a fan, they swoop up
from the ground to alight on a perch.

82 J. R. HODGES--THE RED-FRONTED NEW ZEALAND PARRAKEET
After a short quarantine period the pair were placed in one of the out-
door aviaries of a friend with whom I share my small collection of parra-
keets. The aviary is a conventional one consisting of an enclosed shelter
a covered and an open flight. The length of the flight is only eight fee
and I felt that the aviary, which was intended for Grass Parrakeets, was
too small. However, the Cyanoramphus parrakeets are constantly on th&amp;lt;
move and are so active that they appear to get adequate exercise in y
comparatively confined space.
Since the birds were recently imported and had been placed outsid&amp;lt;
only late in the summer it was intended not to allow them to breed until th(
following year. However, they had other ideas and the hen began to lai
numerous eggs on the floor of the aviary shelter. A hastily constructec
nest-box about i ft. high x 9 in. wide x 9 in. deep was hung in the oper
flight. This was adopted immediately and the hen laid ten eggs, usually
on alternate days, on a few handfuls of rotten wood in the bottom of the
box. Incubation commenced after the third egg had been laid and si?
chicks were hatched about three weeks later. The chicks which wen
covered with grey down grew rapidly. All six were fully reared and the}
left the nest about six weeks after hatching. Both parents fed the young-
sters in the nest-box and after they had learnt to fly and although th&amp;lt;
young were capable of looking after themselves within a fortnight 0
leaving the nest, the parents continued to feed them occasionally foi
several weeks more. The family group was left together for a couple 0
months without the youngsters coming to any harm. They became ven
tame and steady and were, from their shape of head and breadth of beak
quite obviously three cocks and three hens.
In their natural habitat Red-fronted Parrakeets are known to feed or
the seeds, flowers and leaves of many wild plants. They also eat smal
grubs and insects. In captivity they appear to do well on a mixture 0
canary, millet, white and small striped sunflower seeds to which has beer
added a little hemp. They are very fond of fruit and green food and our:
are given apples and green food (if available) every day. They particular!;
like fresh turves of which they eat the stalks and roots of grass and pre
sumably all the insects they can find. One turf keeps them fully occupiec
until it is completely demolished.
When the pair were feeding their chicks they ate enormous quantities 0
plain canary seed but completely ignored millet sprays and the mille
in their seed mixture. They also ate soaked sunflower seeds, one larg&amp;lt;
slice of white bread soaked in milk daily and considerable amounts o
groundsel of which they consumed the leaves, stalks and flowers and whicl
they preferred to any other form of green food.
The Red-fronted Parrakeet is a delightful aviary inhabitant. Ii
addition to its beauty and attractive mannerisms it is hardy, easy to keep
easy to breed and extremely intelligent. On one occasion the feeding
hatch of the aviary of the adult pair was accidently left open. Withii

seconds both the male and the female were apparently enjoying their new-
found freedom and exploring the neighbourhood. After about half an
hour's exercise during which they came off worse in an altercation with
the local Blackbirds, they flew back to the garden. They found their
aviary with no difficulty, even though it is one in a group of identical
compartments, and returned sedately through the feeding hatch.
Perhaps their over-anxiety to reproduce themselves can be a dis-
advantage as we discovered recently. The adult hen came into breeding
condition again early in January of this year, laid several eggs without
apparent difficulty but was picked up dead one morning after the tempera-
ture had fallen during the night to 20 *F. Post-mortem examination
showed, as was expected, that death was caused by egg binding. It is
easy to be wise after the event but the female should have been taken in for
the remainder of the winter when it became so anxious to nest in the
worst possible weather conditions. Another tragedy occurred with the
sudden development of paralysis of the legs and wings of one of the young
cocks. This bird, which weighed no gm., died within 24 hours, but the
cause of death was not apparent at autopsy. The other youngsters are
now six months old and hardly distinguishable from their parents.
There were, in this country, other breeding successes with this species
in 1967. Mr. A. V. Marques raised several and two more were reared in
Lady Baillie's aviaries. Other successful breedings have probably
occurred and it may not be long before this species is more readily obtain-
able. It certainly makes a charming addition to any parrakeet collection.

PAINTED QUAILS AND INTERSPECIFIC
ALLOPREENING

By C. J. O. Harrison (Perivale, Middlesex, England)
In a recent note J. Trollope (1968) has described interspecific allopreen-
ing ( = " mutual" preening) between Painted Quails (Excalfactoria
chinensis ) and other species of birds. He examined the possibility that
pattern might provide the stimulus for the behaviour but concluded that
it did not, and thought that the clumping together which also occurred
was not due to a need for warmth.
The probable explanation for this type of behaviour has been given by
D. Morris (1956) in a paper on feather postures. Morris was intrigued
by the persistence with which Java Sparrows (Padda oryzivora) would
clump with, and allopreen, resting Barbary Doves ( Streptopelia
roseogrisea ), a fact also noted by D. Goodwin (1952). After examining
the evidence Morris came to the conclusion that the stimulus which
elicited clumping and allopreening behaviour from birds in general was
the sight of a bird in a fluffed and immobile posture. The doves, by
adopting such a posture when resting, and by virtue of the fact that their

size made them a much more obvious signal, provided a supernormal
stimulus and were preened by some of the Java Sparrows in preference to
members of their own species.
In aviaries the Painted Quail provides just the same kind of supernormal
stimulus for smaller birds, particularly solitary ones which are accustomed
to reciprocal allopreening as a part of their normal social behaviour, but
which lack suitable mates and are therefore more likely to respond to
such a stimulus. For this type of association to occur the second in-
dividual should be of another species in which allopreening naturally
occurs and, as far as is known (Harrison 1965), the Painted Quail is the
only member of the Phasianidae that regularly shows this behaviour.
Since Morris found that Java Sparrows would also try to clump with much
larger pigeons, the fact that Trollope's birds ignored the larger Quail
suggests that they had learned to do so after receiving an adverse response
from a member of a species that would not normally recognise this
attention. It is possible, however, that the supernormal visual signal to
which a bird will react has an optimum size in relation to the size of the
bird responding to it, and that Harlequin Quail, (Coturnix delagorgei) and
Rain Quail (C. coromandelica ) are too large in relation to waxbills.
The Painted Quail not only permits other birds to preen it but will also
preen in return. My own records of interspecific preening by this
species refer to a solitary male in an aviary at the London Zoo which was
seen to preen the head of a resting Rain Quail that appeared too drowsy
to protest; and also to preen the throat of a solitary White-eared Bulbul
(Pycnonotus leucogenys). The last individual had also been observed
soliciting preening from various other birds in the aviary without success.

The Queen Carola's Parotia (Parotid carolae [Meyer]) is a Bird-of-
Paradise that lives in Central New Guinea from Weyland to Sepik Moun-
tains, from 4,000 to 6,000 ft. (Rand and Gilliard 1967). The male is
predominately velvety-black with an area of white and buff on the flanks.
These lighter areas are, however, not easily seen unless the bird is in
flight or displaying. The feathering about the head, throat and chest is
both colourful and intricate and is best described by the illustrations.

parts, with pale ochaceous underparts barred with black. A broad
greyish-white stripe is conspicuous above and below the eye. When
directly behind the hen peculiar " ear tufts " were noticed. These are
elongated feathers behind the eye which are erected now and then.
A male and female were observed for two full days the ist and 2nd of
October 1967 at Chester Zoo, Cheshire. The birds were in an indoor
aviary approximately 7 ft. x 14 ft. x 8 ft., the rear third of which formed
the shelter. The floor of both shelter and flight was covered with a thick
carpet of peat, there were ample perches and foliage. The house was
heated and no artificial light was used.
I started my observations at about 10 a.m. At this time both birds
were preening themselves, occasionally flying down to feed. After
feeding intense bill wiping was performed and preening continued.
Both birds were seen to clean their feet and toes by running the mandibles
either side of them and picking between the toes. Scratching of the nape
and ear-coverts was performed by the " overwing method " but the male
was seen to scratch the throat directly.
Shortly after midday the cock began singing. First notes to be heard
were soft twitterings and clucking uttered when he was close to the female.
These calls were soon interrupted by an extremely loud and resounding
" Kuck Kurrk " repeated two or three times. During this call the bill
was lifted upward and the neck stretched, (Fig. 2) the crest was slightly
erected.
Fig. 2.--During the call the bill is lifted upward and the neck stretched.
At approximately 1 p.m. the male started displaying, beginning with
rather simple performances which became progressively complicated. I
shall describe the displays in the sequence in which they appeared, a
similar pattern being observed on both days. All displays took place
with both birds on specific horizontal perches the male 5 ft. from the
ground, the female 18 in. above him at " 2 o'clock ".
The first display was performed twice, lasting about 15 seconds on each
occasion. The male flew to his display perch, turned away from the hen
and crouched, displaying the white flank plumes by lifting them over the

primaries. After this display several minutes passed, both birds remaining
on their perches and preening. The male then performed a second type
of display, repeated at short intervals. Hopping up opposite the female
and " sideways facing " changing from one position to the other very
rapidly the feet leaving the perch each time the position was changed.
(Fig. 3 ).
Fig. 3. --Sideways facing display.
Approximately ten minutes of preening followed the second display
and then the male appeared to prepare himself on his perch below the
female, watching her intently and making slight intention movements.
Suddenly he broke into another display. Head up and back toward the
female he swayed rhythmically from side to side and fluttered his wings
only slightly but very rapidly (Fig. 4). During this performance the
silver crests were parted and the golden-bronze feathers erected between
them, lowered again and the outside crests closed. This movement of
the head feathers was continuously and rapidly repeated, flashing silver,
gold, silver, gold, in quick succession.

Another short preening period followed and then display, somewhat
similar to the last, was given. Back once again to the hen the cock
bobbed vigorously up and down, stretching the body upward with stiff
previous display, but they were occasionally opened to their full extent
at the stretching position. (Fig. 5). During this performance, as in the
last, the crests were moved as previously described.
Fig. 5.--$ = Position from which female observed display.
Almost ten minutes of intense preening by the male then took place,
both birds remaining on their perches. The male then performed a very
quick " intention bob " and broke into what I assume to be typical high
intensity display.
The pre-display bob was a quick jerk, the bill pointing downward and
the tail flicked upward the wings were flicked very slightly and the flank
plumes were brought out. The bird then raised himself to an upright
stance and put all his display feathering to use. The elongated breast
and flank feathers were raised, over the wings, to form a complete skirt
meeting over the centre of the back. Crest feathering was in continuous
movement as in previous displays, but the six wires were raised, separated
and held in front of the bird (Fig. 6). The throat feathers were flickering
continuously, these and the crests being the only parts to move once the
display posture was attained. This display lasted 90 seconds, during which
time the birds did not move on their perches. The display ended as
suddenly as it started, with the wires, crests and skirt all flicked back to
the normal positions.
Once again a period of preening, by the male, followed, but this time
he continuously moved the crest as in the displays. The last described

display was once again performed this time lasting only 20 seconds at the
end of which the female flew down beside the male, hung upside down,
looked at him and fluttered to the ground.
This short display was followed by fifteen minutes of disturbance
between the birds. The male would prepare himself for display below
the hen, the hen fly off her perch and the cock chase her about until she
returned to it. Then the male displayed once again. This by the
performance was very short lasting only 9 or 10 seconds, but was observed,
female from between her legs (Fig. 7).

The final display I witnessed took place at about 5 p.m., six minutes
ifter the preceding one. This was a very long and intense display,
almost five minutes) the first half of which was watched by the hen from

he " pre-display bob " then the display. This time the male moved
vhilst in full display side-stepping along his perch and up the adjoining
&amp;gt;ranch, and back again, covering some 2^--3 ft. in all. When back at the

esounding call.

It is worthy of note that what was observed was a series of displays
becoming progressively more intricate as the afternoon continued. I can
find no detailed account of this species displaying in the wild. However
there are several accounts of the other members of this genus, but only
displays similar to the final one (Fig. 6) were seen performed to the female.
It is possible that in the wild, the preceding displays that I observed
are either territorial, or pre-breeding season displays.
It is generally stated that the parotias clear a display area and perform on
the forest floor, only occasionally displaying on a perch. However the
cock bird observed rarely alighted on the ground and certainly did not
remove debris. In contrast the male Lawe's Six-wired Parotia ( P. lawesi)
in the adjoining aviary was continuously clearing an area of tiny particles.
As my observations suggest that this species displays above ground,
not on it, it seems pertinent to mention here the only apparent evidence
to the contrary. Gilliard (1961) was shown what he assumed to be the
" bower " of this species. He did not see the bird at the discovered
bower but observed an adult male which flew into the area in response to
the distress calls of a Cuckoo-Shrike. Later, however, he saw this bird
displaying on the ground beneath a bush in an aviary at Honolulu, where
he had sent it. Thus the question of whether this bird clears a display
place and displays on the ground in a wild state is still open. It is possible
that either the male I observed, or Gilliard's injured specimen, might have
chosen an unnatural or unusual display level owing to some adverse
factor(s) of their captivity.

The Indus is one of the great rivers of India, rising in the Himalayas
t flows over the great alluvial plains of Upper India, over the desert sands
)f Sind until it reaches the Sukkur Gorge. Here its waters are held, but
lot impounded, by the Sukkur Barrage and thence, led by great canals
vhich flow to left and right, by ever lessening channels until the life-giving
waters reach the cultivated fields so that verily the desert blossoms like
:he rose. Along its length the water attracts the birds so that for the
flrd-lover the scene is one of ever changing interest. The great Black
md White Kingfisher is ever conspicuous as with fast-beating wings it
lovers over the water until it dives and retrieves its fish. The attractive
ittle sandpipers run ever before one, teal fly suddenly from the reed beds
md turtles bask in the sun upon small floating logs.
When in the Monsoon, say from June to October, the great river is in
lood; its waters, swollen by the heavy monsoon rains and the melting
dimalayan snows; if the canal embankments hold, the waters spread over
he desert sands and receding leave great lakes of shallow water which we
'all dhands. Then the Mohanos, a caste of fine men and women, the
ishermen of the rivers, erect their large reed huts by the edges of the
lhands, now full of tiny fish which they feed to the white Egrets which
hey have domesticated, much as the South African farmers have domesti-
:ated the Ostrich, and for much the same purpose, the harvest of the
flumes. The Mohanos, like many other fishermen, are poor and the sale
&amp;gt;f the plumes enabled them to add materially to their meagre incomes
md helped to mitigate the rigours of their hard lives.
There was no cruelty in this. The procedure was as follows. In the
arge reed huts which served as spacious cages or pens the ground was
:overed with rice straw gathered from the neighbouring irrigated fields,
rhe hen egrets would be placed in these pens and in very close company
hey would make their simple nests of straw on the ground and lay their
ggs. The cocks were kept in sufficient numbers, outside the harem, to
ertilize the eggs. When hatched, the young birds would be taken and
eared by hand and in the following spring the nuptial plumes would be
gathered from these birds. So tame were the birds that on the beating
&apos;f an old enamel basin they would come running like so much poultry
o be fed. There is no cruelty in this. At the base of the neck whence
ome these lovely plumes there is a small round patch of soft feathers.
l hese were plucked. The lovely nuptial plumes would come where these
oft feathers had been growing and I was told that if the birds were well
ed there could be two or three pluckings a year. One crop of nuptial
flumes would succeed another. The plumes must be ripe before plucking
nd I was told that if there was one drop of blood the plucking would be
\0x25A0ostponed. I was shown one bird which I was told was ten years old.

I could well believe it. This harmless and indeed beneficient trade was
now threatened.
It was a far cry from the reed huts by the Indus to the forests and
mountains of New Guinea and the forests and rivers of South America
but soon all were to be linked in a common fate, the innocent with the
guilty, the just with the unjust. For a time I had been hearing what they
call in India a " thick rumour " that the keeping of Egrets for the gathering
of their plumes was to be forbidden. It was indeed true but only
indirectly. I write of many years ago, in the years 1916--17 when as a
young district officer I had been posted to Upper Sind. At that time the
motor car had not invaded our remote country districts. Our proper
transport was the camel and the horse. Even now I remember how I
took my favourite riding camel, a fast and elegant beast, so light fawn as
to be near white. We called her Rebecca. I will not tell you why and
we made a great fuss of her and fed her on molasses and on rai, the yellow
mustard which was grown in great quantities as oil seed and the beauty of
its yellow flowers used in the spring to light up the whole countryside,
while from the cover of the young green wheat the migrant Quail on their
passage to the far north-west would repeatedly call. Such is the wonder
of migration. I did not take my driver with me for, good fellow as he
was, when he perspired there was a strong smell of the great unwashed.
Indeed, sometimes I used to think I would steal a few hairs from the
black curls at the nape of his neck and pop them in a test tube and when I
was homesick for Sind I would take out the cork and sniff. But I never did.
I was determined if I could, to save tame and farm-bred birds and the
small profit they yielded to our hard pressed Mohanos. So early one
morning I rode to one of the farms and photographed the hen birds sitting
on their eggs, the young being reared by hand, and the reed huts standing
by the flood waters of the Indus. It would, I thought, be possible to
distinguish the plumes of the tame and farm-bred birds and the plumes of
the wild birds of the forests of South America slaughtered so mercilessly.
It was my idea that the farms might be licensed as also the exporters and
importers. I sent copies of the photographs to the proper authorities but
all in vain. It may be difficult after the passage of all these years to
appreciate the scandalous proportions of this iniquitous traffic in bird skins
and feathers. Thousands of skins of the lovely Birds of Paradise were
exported and the birds brought close to extinction for the profit of the
trader and for the adornment of one of the most extraordinary of human
inventions--the woman's hat. I heard that those in authority, and they
may well have been right, were of the opinion to license our farms was
to open a loophole for the evasion of the ban. So the importation of
plumes was forbidden and the greater preservation and domestication of
one of our most lovely birds was by so much impeded and the Mohanos
lost the means of mitigating the harshness of their lives.
I have often been impressed by the close association of the Indian (now

also the Pakistani) with animal and bird life. Many a time as I have been
travelling in one of the flat bottomed boats along a canal the boatman
would draw out from under the wooden seat a tame pond heron which he
would feed with a few small fish he had brought for that purpose. On
the great river boats which were moored to the banks of the Indus at
Sukkur, I have seen the Grey Heron and the larger White Egret tethered
by the leg to a pole projecting from the sides of the boat, catching small
fish, as the river flowed by. In the well of one of these large boats I
would see at times a number of tethered otters quietly resting which would
later help the fishermen to take the fish driven by them into the nets,
stretched from one side to the other of one of the narrower canals. It
would never occur to anyone to chase and kill for sport one of these active
and intelligent animals. I have thought that there existed in this far
country a community of life between animal and man which civilization
in other countries has destroyed. We should indeed, I suppose, be
grateful that the elite of our young manhood does not ride forth on
Sundays on bicycles, clad in their most colourful garments, and suitably
or unsuitably armed, to do battle with Thrushes, Skylarks and Gold-
finches and other small song birds, whose gentle bodies after appropriate
preparation, they will devour. I have read, though I do not believe all
I read, even when it confirms my own prejudices, that the lovely little
Ortolan is netted and fattened and devoured by gourmets, who covering
their heads with table napkins (not the other variety) to keep in the
delicate aroma, devour these tender morsels, so exquisitely and expertly
prepared with wine. On the other hand the ceremonies of the 12th of
August may seem to some people quite remarkable.
The domestication of animals and birds has been a matter of great
antiquity and importance in the history of man. I find it a strange and
humbling thought that many of us rely for nourishment and support on
the mammalian products of the cow and the ovarian products of the hen
and of the slaughter house. The Canary and the Budgerigar comparatively
recently domesticated have given to many kind-hearted persons, surely a
sub-species of Homo sapiens , the great predator, to be encouraged, many
hours of simple and kindly pleasure. " The man who keeps Canaries is a
kindly sort of man ". Is there any reason why the domestication of
song birds under proper conditions should not be encouraged and succeed?
I have a much treasured book by a French Historian, Jules Michelet.
It is called simply " The Bird " and was published in 1895 in London by
Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons of Paternoster Row. It is for me, alas, dated by
a label appropriately decorated, on the inside cover, with a quaint citation
reciting that it is a prize awarded in June, 1901, " for good conduct,
diligence and attention to lessons ". Thus have the years fled, but on
page 307 of the book occurs a passage which for the elegance of its style
and thought, deserves repetition, "To recreate all the conditions of abode,
food, vegetable environment and the harmonies of every kind which shall

deceive the exile into forgetfulness of his country is not only a scientific
question but a task of ingenious invention. To determine the limit of
slavery, of freedom, of alliance and collaboration with ourselves, proper
for each individual creature, is one of the gravest subjects which can
occupy us. A new art is this nor shall you succeed in this without a moral
gravity, a refinement of appreciation which at present are scarcely under-
stood and shall exist, perhaps only, when Woman undertakes those
scientific studies from which she has hitherto been excluded. This art
suppose a tenderness unlimited in justice and wisdom ". Dated and
quaint this may be but it contains much truth. Witness the recent breed-
ing of a Humming Bird by one of our members of the requisite sex.
Indeed over the years I have found birds thrive best when they are
tame and cared for with the tenderness which is a compensation for their
captivity. I have written about the Grey Partridge or Francolin of India,
which when reared from a chick, often by a shepherd boy, will outvie in
confidence and tameness the domestic hen and will in its proper season
sit quietly on her nest in the corner of a room in the mudhouse where the
gardener takes his meals with his family; and the contentment of the
garden reigns all around. Indeed many birds, even if not so apt for
domestication as the Zebra finch or the Sharp-tailed or Striated Munia
from which that classic example of domestication from the Far East, the
Bengaleese, is descended, will thrive if not kept in too large a cage (and
the old fanciers knew much about this) away from draughts and properly
fed and in a proper temperature, which, if in these islands, will be the
temperature at which we humans feel comfortable; and with access to the
life-giving rays of the early morning sun. I have found in India and
indeed in this country, small finches thrive best in all-wire cages. An
Indian friend and I made many cages in the fashion of bamboo cages but
of wood and wire. Packing cases and rolls of galvanized wire were our
raw material and with these we made cages in which we bred Red Avadavats
and Green Avadavats and St. Helena Waxbills and others, ejusdem generis.
We were at a disadvantage with the native craftsman, and I use this
epithet with the greatest admiration and respect, because we could not
use our toes as fingers.

was offered, from which the bird fed only with mild interest. Later
maggots and live tubifex worms were fed in the water and the shore birc
then began to feed in ernest. The immediate feeding of live food is, ii
my view, an essential part of the acclimating of wild adult shore birds
In the following days, the ever-popular meal worm was added to th&amp;lt;
diet for protein, and was readily accepted, and subsequent examinatioi
showed the bird to be fattening up nicely. It began to bathe in the watei
pan and take dust baths, and slowly regained limited use of the injurec
wing. The broken member was not touched, as it remained in a neai
natural position, even when the bird was captured.
The Dunlin appears to be a rather tame, confiding shore bird, and a:
such would lend itself to captive propagation, should the need for thes&amp;lt;
studies arise. They have, in the United States, suffered great losses a
the hands of market gunners in the past, but are recovering in moderati
numbers. I am sure the bird is not often seen in captivity, even in zoos
so much research is to be done regarding their habits. The most of
displayed action on the part of this individual was a frequent pivoting am
a seeming displacement action of feeding on bill stabbing motions.
On the 2nd of February the bird was consigned to the Philadelphia Zoo
8 days after its' capture. I submit this information in the event it ma;
assist anyone picking up a similar member of this family in distress

MEYER'S PARROT

By V. Dilwyn Jones (Llandrindod Wells, Wales)
For a number of years I have been keenly interested in the smal
parrots and from time to time I have kept and tried to breed Senegal
(Poecephalus senegalus ), Meyer's ( Poecephalus meyeri) and Ruppell'
(Poecephalus ruppelli).
My Senegals laid on several occasions but the eggs were never fertil
and ultimately, when my acclimatized hen died, I gave them up.
I had a very nice pair of Ruppell's, but both died during a very har&amp;lt;
winter and I have never been able to replace them.
At the same time, I had a reputed pair of Meyer's, but nearly two year
passed without any result. The birds seemed quite friendly, but th
one which I then thought was a hen (but which I now think may have beei
an immature cock bird) died and again I gave up hope of breeding results
By a fortunate coincidence, within a couple of weeks I saw a Meyer' 1
hen advertised and I purchased her, although when she arrived I wa
very disappointed. She was a rather miserable specimen and a mor
than usual clumsy flier, but the red iris was quite distinctive and I there
fore decided to put the birds together in one of my smallest aviaries

This was in 1962, but by the Spring of 1964 the hen had very greatly
mproved and when I saw my original cock bird feeding her I felt
leartened, as this indicated that at least I had a true pair.
By this time the birds were in a small outside unheated aviary, about
welve feet by four feet and six feet high, built at the snug and sunny
:orner of the north and west walls of my garden. The nesting-log was a
)seudo tree trunk, three feet six inches high and sixteen inches in diameter,
rhe hen went to nest shortly afterwards and laid four eggs, but all were
nfertile.
In 1965 she laid four eggs again and this time two young were hatched,
)ut both died before leaving the nesting-log.
In the late Spring of 1966, the hen went to nest again, but for fear of
ipsetting her I did not risk a " peep " for some weeks, and when I did
00k into the log there were three chicks and one infertile egg. I had a
juick " peep " from time to time and all the youngsters seemed to be
&amp;gt;rogressing well.
They came out of the nesting-log at intervals of about three or four
lays and were flying (albeit clumsily) with their parents until the Spring
)f 1967, when I placed them together in the small aviary where they still
ire--being, I am fairly sure, two cocks and a hen.
When they emerge, the youngsters are of a very attractive green brown
:olour with plain dark brown heads. The shoulder patches are much
mailer than in adult birds.
Incidentally, it seems very hard to sex young Meyer's in their baby
flumage and it seems to me that they do not attain full maturity until
t least two years old. The youngest of the three has only now the
beginnings of head markings.
In 1967, I had an early hatch of three more youngsters (which are still
loing well) and the hen went to nest again in September of that year.
Three more youngsters were hatched, but all of these died during the
&amp;gt;ast winter, which has been very severe here--we are about seven hundred
nd fifty feet above sea level.
I am now left with eight of these very nice little parrots--my original
*air, two cocks and one hen bred in 1966 and three of my first 1967 clutch,
*elieved to be two cocks and a hen.
I am keeping one of the 1967 cock (?) birds in a roomy cage in my bird
00m, but I very much doubt whether it will make a good pet.
The incubation period seems to be about a month, but the chicks
emain in the nesting log for about six or seven weeks.
My Meyer's are fed on sunflower, hemp, canary, melon rind, sweet
pple, monkey nuts and green food of various kinds, including dandelion,
pinach etc. They are also very fond of the berries of Mountain Ash and
lawthorn.
When there were chicks in the log, I gave the parents soaked bread
squeezed nearly dry) sprinkled with Bemax.

Malaysian wreathed Hornbills (Aceros u. undulcitus): males--black with
chestnut head and crest, blue-gray bare-skin throat patch, white tail,
wrinkled casque; females are all black with white tails.
Of the 19 specimens of Malaysian Wreathed Hornbills I have obtained
while collecting for zoos, eight were wild-caught adults and 11 were
obtained as nestlings and hand-raised. Without exception, the hand-
raised specimens were consistently gentle birds even into adulthood;
however, all but two (both males) of the wild-caught adult birds were
extremely aggressive. Four of the wild-caught adults were released
when they refused to eat for five consecutive days, and two died from
undetermined causes within 20 days of their capture. All of the nestlings
were reared and (to the best of my knowledge) are still alive.
Specimens were collected in Malaysia (the states of Sabah, Selangor,
Kedah, and Melaka) and Sumatra. They are not particularly common in
any of these areas, but are more frequently seen than the similar Blyth's
Wreathed Hornbill ( Aceros plicatus subruficollis). One pair (male and
female) of the fairly rare Bushy-crested Hornbill ( Anorrhinus galeritus
carinatus ) was obtained from a young Malay who had shot the parents
for eating, and hand-raised the young birds as pets. (At least this was his
story). They were obtained in the north-western part of the Malaysian
state of Johore.
The hand-raised Wreathed Hornbills generally retained their desire
for being hand-fed until they attained the average age of seven months.
At this time they were mature appearing birds that would incessantly
gape for feeding. When they were housed more than one per enclosure,
they would line up on a perch and noisily wait to be fed. They did not
appear to take the same order each feeding, but each waited his turn.
By the time they were starting to eat on their own, they could consume
two mice, one or two bananas, and a half-pound of lumpy insectivorous
bird mixture each feeding. If mice or baby chicks were put in the cage,
the hornbills would sit on their perch watching and gaping, never attempt-
ing to go down and pick them up. Once a single bird had ventured down
to pick up its own food, the others would invariably start doing the same
within three to five days.
In my contact with these hand-raised birds I never had one deliberately
attack me, but in their eagerness to eat they would frequently (mistakenly?)
grasp my fingers. Their first reaction seemed to be to jerk, twist, and
make every effort to get that " stubborn extra tidbit " loose.

A disconcerting habit they developed was to scrap over who would ride
on their feeder's shoulder around the cage while he was cleaning. This
same process was followed no matter who cared for them. They
appeared to have no favourites and to exhibit no fear of any human.
The two adult male wild-caught specimens that readily adapted to
captivity were neither friendly nor aggressive. They approached their
caretaker with caution, but not with apparent fear or aggression. Their
curiosity was extraordinary, and they would readily stick their heads into
any pail or container in the enclosure apparently to see what it offered.
The last specimen I obtained was an adult male that had been hand-
raised as a pet by an elderly Chinese woman near Alor Star (Malaysia).
She also hand-raised numerous Hoopoes (Upopa e. epops ) for several
animal collectors. This male was by far the most handsome of all the
specimens collected. (It is now at the Buffalo Zoo). At the same time
that this single specimen was obtained two half-feathered Great Hornbills
(Buceros bicornis) were acquired. They required constant attention and
feeding. The male Wreathed was housed with the two young Great
Hornbills and immediately started to feed the two young hornbills. When
food was placed in the enclosure, the adult Wreathed would feed the two
young Great Hornbills until they stopped gaping before he would swallow
any food himself.
The two Great Hornbills, which are now at the Oklahoma City Zoo,
were fed by the Wreathed Hornbill for over six months on my farm in the
United States before the adopted parent gradually changed them over to
eating on their own. Both young birds were in full adult plumage and
were capable of flying quite well before they ever picked up food on their
own. Young Great Hornbills have been observed in the field by Negri
Sembilan Game Warden Dara Singh, eating by themselves at what
appeared to be a much younger age than these captive specimens.
Wild-caught adult Wreathed Hornbills observed at five zoos in Asia
all displayed severe aggression to their keepers. Two captive-raised
females in the Melaka Zoo were docile and appeared to seek human as
well as other bird company. They were even housed with a pair of small
Philippine Tarictic Hornbills (Penelopides panini) and displayed no
aggression, apparently acting as a calming factor on the smaller hornbills.

SUMMARY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.8861905" page_id="58089080"  page_num="99" year="" vol="">
Captive-raised Malaysian Wreathed Hornbills displayed little to no aggression
towards humans. This applied to both males and females housed singly or
collectively. Wild-caught adult birds were aggressive and almost impossible to
acclimate. Two of eight wild-caught adult birds (both males) adapted readily to
captive life and displayed little aggression.

One Black-footed Penguin, two Cereopsis Geese and one Javan Fish-
Owl have been bred in the Gardens. Only one egg was laid by the
fish-owl and so far as is known one has constituted the clutch on previous
occasions, so this may be the normal clutch. This pair regularly nests
very early in the year and may, of course, nest again as happened last year,
though in that instance the first chick died at an early age. Other owls
incubating eggs are the Great, Kenya, Spotted and Magellan Eagle-Owls,
and perhaps the Barn Owls.
Pigmy Falcons failed to hatch anything from the first clutch; it is not
mown how many eggs were laid, but, as before, only one was found in the
nest. These birds may be nesting again in a hollow tree trunk as before.
Three species new to the collection have been received; these are a
Luzon Hornbill, Buceros hydrocorax hydrocorax, two Acorn Woodpeckers,
Melanerpes forinicivorus , that were bred by the brothers Callegari in their
iviaries at Ravenna and a Rustic Bunting, Emberiza rustica , that was
presented together with a Yellow-throated Bunting, E. elegans , by Mr.
U L. Restall.
There are some seven or eight races of Melanerpes formicivorus ranging
rom south-western parts of North America, through Central America to
)arts of Colombia, the three occurring in the United States being known
5 the California or Acorn, Mearns's and Ant-eating Woodpeckers and it
s not known to which of the races the Ravenna birds belong, for they are
till in the immature plumage.
Another presentation is a specimen of Kakatoe sulphurea that is unlike
ither of the other two races ( sulphurea and parvula ) that are already here,
or it is larger and the crest straighter. Possibly it is K.s. abbotti , the race
uhabiting the island of Solombo Besar in the Java Sea.

A pair of Sacred Ibises occupied one of last year's nests and two eggs
which later disappeared, were laid. In the spring and summer the flanks
of these ibises become a brownish-yellow and I believe that this is due to
the birds anointing these areas with oil from the preen gland, for this oil
is of exactly the same colour. In winter the flank feathers are white.

Philip Wayre showed his colour film " Pheasants to Formosa ".
This film which was first shown in colour on BBC 2 on 26th September,
1967, tells the story of the return to Taiwan of some Swinhoe's Pheasants
bred by the Ornamental Pheasant Trust and released in their native land
to reinforce the wild population which is threatened with extinction.
The film also covers Philip and Pat Wayre's journey into the remote
interior of the island in search of wildlife, with particular reference to rare
species of birds and mammals believed to be threatened with extinction.
They spent some time with the aborigines in the Central Mountain Range
and are believed to have been the only Europeans to have seen Swinhoe s
Pheasant alive in the wild. A full report on their observations of the
wildlife of the island with suggestions for its conservation is being sent to
I. U.C.N. and to the authorities in Taiwan.

A correspondent in " American Cage-bird Magazine ", November,
1967, 22, asks: " What is the best way to put a bird to sleep? " The
answer given is: " The best way for the average fancier, with no access
to a medical lab., is the way I do it. I put the bird in a paper bag, start
the car up and then hold the bag to the exhaust pipe. It is all over in
seconds. I then bury the bird, bag and all, if I can put a shovel in the
ground. This way I do not even have to see the bird." This is a problem
that must from time to time face innumerable bird-keepers. All do not
have access to chloroform; in its absence what really is the best means
of euthanasia?

Dr. Geoffrey McLachlan Tygerberg Zoo Park, Durbanville, South
Africa, writes: " Pressure of work developing the major exhibits of the
Zoo (Chimpanzees, Rhinoceroses, Lions, Tigers, etc.) has meant that
birds have so far been more or less neglected. We have, however, a fair
collection of ducks on view. We were successful in breeding the
Knob-billed Duck, Sarkidiornis melanotos, which hatched five eggs, but
only one young one survived.
More successful was the hybridization of the Red-billed Teal, Anas
erythrorhyncha and the Cape Teal, Anas capensis. Five young were
hatched and reared to maturity. Unfortunately, they flew off before
being pinioned. In colour they were exactly intermediate between the
adults; the cap of the Red-billed being somewhat paler in the young.
Another female failed to hatch her clutch."

In the January-February number of the Magazine, Franco Cuneo
recorded the successful rearing of a King Vulture, Sarcoramphus papa ,
hatched in the Naples Zoological Gardens, in 1966.
Dr. Heinz Heck, Director, Catskill Game Farm, New York, in recent
correspondence, says that a young one successfully reared there in i960
is flourishing; only last year, this bird lost its remaining dark, juvenile
feathers.
An egg was laid on 16th March and hatched on nth May. Another
young one was hatched on 31st March, 1961, but disappeared on 13th
April, apparently eaten by its parents. The incubation period was 56
days in i960 and 58 days in 1961.
This pair of King Vultures has laid on numerous occasions, but the
eggs either disappeared or were destroyed, presumably because they were
not fertile. (See D. Zoolog . Garten (NF), 1963, 295-297).

Curt af Enehjelm, Director, Hogholmens Djurgard, Helsingfors,
writes of 1967: " I had one of the worst breeding seasons I can remember,
due to the loss of some of my best breeding pairs, pairs split up through
death, clear eggs, etc. I suspect that oil was partly to blame. I have
been using sea sand and possibly there has been some oil in it.

Late in the autumn, 1966, I bred two Black-cheeked Waxbills, Estrilda
erythronotos, both are still doing well. I believe this to be a very rare
breeding in Europe, although it has been bred several times in South
Africa.
I am working on the genetics of the two Parson Finch sub-species,
Poephila c. cincta and P. c. atropygialis. I have a number of pure-bred
and crosses " both-ways I am sure the heredity rules should be the
same as with Bicheno's Finch, Stizoptera b. bichenovii and S. b. annulosa ,
where the white back is dominant over the black, but I have got some
unexpected " exceptions " so I must continue my experiments.
Regarding the owls in 1967. I bred only two Snowy, two Virginian
Eagle-Owls and, of course, Kenya Eagle-Owls, Bubo cape?isis macinderi .
The last are a very hard-working pair. They started sitting 13th Decem-
ber, 1965, three eggs, one chick hatched 16th January, 1966; another
chick was hatched on 23rd August, 1966. They again started sitting on
13th October, 1966, two eggs; two young were hatched on 28th and

I have always admired the Loriidae. Some forty-five years ago I had
quite an extensive collection, but it came to a tragic and untimely end.
In those days blue flame burners and the excellent blue, pink and green
paraffins were unknown. We had to make do with heaters advertised
" as used by orchid growers ". Provided burners were decarbonized
daily they did not smell too much, but the paraffin was noisome in the
extreme and the very idea of using such would scare present day users
of this form of heat. This particular type of heater consisted, in the main,
of a flat wick, about five inches wide, surrounded by asbestos. The
heating element was mounted above two tanks, the lower containing
paraffin and the upper water (to feed the asbestos and keep it moist). By
some inexplicable mischance the aviary attendant filled both tanks
with paraffin, with the result that the heater smoked very badly indeed.
By next morning several of the lories were already dead and the remainder
covered with thick, oily soot. Every possible means was mobilized to
clean them, but all efforts were unavailing and they all eventually suc-
cumbed. After that extremely unfortunate experience I never had
another lory or lorikeet.
This note is prompted by the advertisement of a dealer in West
Germany. During the past two or three years a couple of our members,
Jack Rawlings and Bill Brown, have been very successful in breeding
lorikeets--three " firsts ". From this one might think that their breed-
ing was fairly easy, but I am quite sure it is not as easy as the advertise-
ment would lead one to believe. The following eight species of lories
and lorikeets are advertised as " bred in West Germany": Violet-necked,
Ornate, Swainson's and Mitchell's Lorikeets; and Red, Purple-capped,
Yellow-backed and Chattering Lories.

From time to time Charles Lucas, President, Avicultural Society of
Australia, sends me a news-letter. In one received early in January he
writes: " I have had quite a successful season with my parrots but not
much luck with the finches. Our difficulties during the breeding season
were greatly increased owing to the fact that we have had here in Victoria
probably the worst drought in our experience. The result was that
seeding grasses were only available for a matter of a few weeks when,
owing to the heat and lack of water, they all dried up. We were compelled
to go back to the good old stand-by of lettuce leaves for green feed.
I had six pairs of Princess paired off and five of these pairs produced
a total of fourteen young, which is the best result I have had with them
for some years. My old pair of Crimson-wings went to nest as usual
and produced three nice young ones, but the Smokers and Barrabands
did not do a thing and there were few Neophemas. I have a young
Elegant from one nest which is a bright canary yellow on the back and
partly into the wing-feathers. It is a very strong and healthy young bird,
so I may be able to make something of it by crossing it back to one of
the parents.
A few years ago we had the good fortune to get in from overseas a
number of Red-faced Parrot Finches. We, of course, had to pay a high
price for them but they proved excellent breeders for a few years.
They then began to lose their stamina. About two years ago I had twenty-
six in my finch aviary, but they have gradually dwindled until today I
have only about six left and they are unfortunately not breeding, so the
indications are that I will soon be without any of these most attractive
birds: other aviculturists have had the same experience."

This is the fourth edition of this well-known work, revised and brought
up to date, and is printed in the United States as a Dover publication.
Accordingly mention is made of many American birds and several photo-

of the misunderstanding that may arise with popular names, for across the
Atlantic the same bird may have a different name and different birds have
the same name.
There could be no more attractive introduction to the subject of bird
behaviour than this well--chosen summary of some of the more interesting

PIGEONS AND DOVES OF THE WORLD. By Derek Goodwin.

A general book on the Columbidae, a family of birds which constitutes
alone the order Columbiformes, was sorely needed. There are very
numerous species, distributed all over the world, wherever suitable
conditions exist, and they have always been popular with man, often,
unfortunately, because they are edible; but they also have captivated his
imagination. The dove is famous as a symbol of peace, a regrettable
mistake, as they are among the most pugnacious and quarrelsome of
birds. Some species have even been domesticated: the Rock Pigeon and
the Ring-doves--others are being continually bred in captivity, such as
the Diamond Dove, while yet others have been acclimatized in parts
of the world where they did not exist before. Mr. Goodwin's book is
therefore most welcome, and I hasten to say that, within the limits of its
446 pages, it is excellent.
There are hundreds of species of Pigeons and Doves, and to deal in
detail with each of them and its subspecies would necessitate eight or ten
large volumes. However essential information can be found in this one
quarto.
The same can be said for the illustrations. There are three coloured
plates representing a number of striking species, sexual and age differences
it would have been marvellous to have every form shown in colour--
Dut again it is practically impossible to accomplish it. There are, however,
many line drawings and maps which fill our requirements sufficiently.
They are done by Robert Gillmor, some after sketches by Mr. Goodwin
fimself from living specimens, and they are quite adequate and useful.
The author s systematic treatment of the Columbiformes appears to
ne very satisfactory. He has wisely lumped a number of unnecessary
genera. Perhaps a few of the species he recognizes could be described as
&amp;gt;ub-species if more accurate data on the distribution were available. It
s to be deplored that a complete list and more details of sub-species
:ould not be provided, but lack of room did not allow it; some very well-
mown and sharply characterized ones, such as Streptopelia bitorquata
iussumien , of the Philippines, are not even mentioned. Also, biblio-
graphy has been omitted and references are reduced to the original
lescription, following the specific name, and to a very few references at
he end of the article. As far as aviculturists are concerned, it is regret-
able that there is no mention of captivity records. Mr. Goodwin is very
lever at keeping and rearing birds, and the observation of his caged

pigeons and doves has taught him a great deal as it has many other
ornithologists.
As I have said before, all the above regrets, which are not criticisms,
are due to the fact that one cannot state everything pertaining to a large
group of birds within less than 500 pages.
There are very few faults to be found in the text. All I could locate is
that the map of Tver on vernans does not show the distributional area of
this Green Pigeon in Southern Indo-China; that Ducula pacified breeds
in the Loyalty Islands and occasionally in New Caledonia, and that
Gallicolumba criniger always lays only one egg in a clutch, a puzzling
characteristic as the closely allied Bleeding-heart ( G . luzonica ) always lays
two.
After a highly sensible introduction, one finds excellent general chapters
on nomenclature, adaptation, coloration, plumage sequences, clutch and
egg colour, feeding habits, drinking, bathing, sunning, preening and
comfort movements, voice and other sounds signals, display and social
behaviour (this is a long and very interesting study), pairs formation and
relationship, nesting and parental care, escape and other anti-predator
movements.
The bulk of the volume consists of the listing of genera and species.
There is a full discussion of their positions for every genus. Then each
species is well described; field characters, distribution, feeding and
general habits, nesting, voice and displays, are given in an accurate and
fairly extensive way, as long as they are known. It is a good resume of
whatever is known at present. As I have said before, Mr. Goodwin s
nomenclature and classification does in my opinion represent an excellent
way of treating this large and well characterized order, and I hope it will
be accepted by the majority of ornithologists. He must be highly con-
gratulated for having achieved such a remarkable and condensed piece
of work.

This book makes the first major attempt to describe bird songs in
musical terms and includes a detailed description of the songs of 127
species occurring in the U.S.A. It is pointed out that success in identify-
ing birds' songs depends more upon the ability of the ear to discriminate
differences of rhythm than upon differences of tone, although some
authors entertain a contrary opinion. Modulation and fine shades ol
" colour " together with melodious phrasing are said to take the place of
rhythm, but this may be a confusion of mechanical time with the rhythm
or metre.

A diagram is provided of the drum beat as the most obvious explanation
of a rhythmic beat. It is stated that any child would know what was being
represented if this was tapped out on a table, but the reviewer fails to
understand what it means! The author goes into considerable detail to
explain a musical key and on page xxxii (not xxii as erroneously stated in
the text) gives a diagram of note values, etc. The diagram on page xxxiv
shows the pitch of 21 bird songs relatively with the keyboard, and another
diagram shows the pitch of 15 bird songs relatively to the keyboard.
Then follows a description of the musical scales of the Thrushes, including
the most melodious of bird songs.
After this introductory chapter the author deals with the songs of 127
species of birds occurring in the U.S.A., in each case giving the musical
notation of the song, and descriptions of the syllables. Even Owls are
included in the list of songsters although the Screech Owl is not on the
" prohibitive " list of songbirds recognized by the State laws. In
addition to descriptions of the songs of the birds considered, the book
includes black and white illustrations of them and also six maps relating
to the migrations of birds. The text illustrations of this interesting
treatise are excellent but the half-tone plates of the birds themselves
might well have been omitted.

EGG EATING IN THE BUDGERIGAR (Melopsittacus undulatus)

Recently in our laboratory, budgerigars were observed to devour an egg laid in
:he open section of the cage by a budgerigar hen. The hen had been evicted from
1 nest box prior to this by a dominant hen.
All budgerigars in the cage ate the egg (including the hen which laid it).
An egg which has been abandoned has little or no hope of survival as the young
)ird must be fed by the parent for some weeks after hatching. If the abandoned
igg was not eaten, its high nutrient value would be lost to the colony, and in the
&amp;gt;pen arid areas to which the species is endemic this would indeed be unfortunate.
It would seem that budgerigars may have evolved this nutrient-saving mechanism
n their natural environment where food is scarce, and what at first is apparently
:enseless cannibalism may be an ecological energy conserving action.
This hypothesis was based on a single observation, but I have never witnessed
lor heard reports of the eating of eggs in a nest box even when the hen was
emporarily absent. Other evidence now at hand supports this view, but is as yet
nconclusive.
To test this hypothesis we will have to observe the budgerigar in its natural state.
Meanwhile I would like to hear from breeders and fanciers who have observed
ither:
Eggs abandoned in the open cage (stating whether eaten or uneaten), or eggs
aten in the nest-box.

I had the pleasure of visiting the State breeding farm for Nene Geese on Hawaii,
at Pohakuloa, on 29th February, 1968. There are 24 pairs of breeding birds, each
one placed in a good sized grassy pen, covered with wire-netting. The results for
1968 are excellent; just over 100 young birds have been reared this season and
20 to 30 more are expected. After experimenting with muscovy ducks and
broody hens as foster mothers, also with incubators with greater or lesser
success, Mr. Ah. Fat Lee, who is in charge of the project, made a new experiment
in 1967. He has let each pair hatch their first clutch of eggs, then immediately
removed the goslings, which have been reared in brooders. The geese lay again
and they are allowed to rear the second brood.
A certain number of wild broods have been observed on the high volcanoes of
Hawaii, some on Maui--But it is not easy to count them accurately.
Mr. Lee should be warmly congratulated for his very successful handling of
the Nene.

In 1965 I brought some Blue-crowned Hanging Parrakeets, and they proved to
be three males and two females. In 1966 one pair had three clutches, the other
pair two, unfortunately infertile except one egg, where the chick was dead at an
early stage. In the autumn of 1966 one of the females, after moulting, showed the
red gular patch of the male, but a little darker in colour. In 1967 there was only
one egg, infertile, but in the autumn the second hen got a red gular patch. This
hen died in January 1968.
On 10 January, 1968, I discovered three eggs in a box, and a few days later there
was at least one chick; the hen was in the box when I checked.
I would be very pleased to know if any of the readers of the Avicultural
Magazine have seen a similar case of male colouring in the female of this species.

DEFINITION OF THE WORD " AVICULTURE "
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9931108" page_id="58089091"  page_num="110" year="" vol="">
It has taken us a while to get to writing to you in appreciation for the definition
of the word " aviculture " on page 178 of the September-October 1967 issue of
Avicultural Magazine.
When we started to become so very much involved in birds some 10 years ago
(this may not seem a long time to folk who have known and loved birds much, much
longer--like 30 years or more!) we wanted a name for ourselves that would explain
our hobby?
In one of our bird books we found the word aviculture and we believed this
meant us. In reading what A. A. Prestwich wrote, we were assured we were right
in taking this name.
We joined a bird club hoping to learn more about birds but the members were
bird-fanciers interested only in showing their birds and coming home with all the
trophies their arms could hold. We have kept our membership in this club just
for the contacts it gives us with bird folk, hoping always that somewhere, sometime
we will meet other aviculturists.

AVICULTURAL CONSERVATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99568198245614" page_id="58089092"  page_num="111" year="" vol="">
I find interesting the suggestion by Mr. E. Marshall Boehm (Avicultural
Magazine Vol. 73, No. 4) of establishing a world avicultural centre for the con-
servation of rare species, but question if the idea is feasible.
The Red Book, compiled by the International Council for Bird Preservation and
issued in conjunction with the International Union for Conservation of Nature,
lists the many species of birds which are considered to be in danger of becoming
extinct. Obviously some of these forms are at present beyond avicultural
assistance but perhaps one hundred species, or more, could be and in some cases
are being bred in confinement.
To house say six breeding pairs (a safety minimum) of one hundred rare species
and provide aviaries for acclimatization and young stock requirements would
really be a formidable project in view of the very limited funds available for the
conservation of Wild Life.
Thinking further of expense, a considerable scientific staff and skilled keepers
would be needed together with full research facilities and the establishing of a
complete dietary programme (bearing in mind the eventual re-introduction of
captive bred stock to the wild state) which would impose a strain on any foundation.
Unhappily it would not be possible, in my view, to offset the expenditure by
allowing the general public access to the centre for the disturbance caused thereby
would diminish the number of birds bred.
The risks of infection, fire, theft and acts of God to a single bank of rare avifauna
are too terrible to contemplate.
Perhaps as an aviculturist in a minute way, I think small but I doubt if a com-
plete programme involving acclimatization, general health, correct nutritional needs
for both breeding and re-establishment in the wild, could be organized for each
equally important species all at the same time.
If all countries had both the will to save its natural fauna and flora and the
resources of wealth and local experts the problem of conservation would in most
cases be largely concerned with maintaining a healthy balance.
In the topical case, competant aviculturists, registered with the appropriate
Government department, would be entrusted with pairs of the endangered species.
Numbers would build up in captivity and ornithologists would study the cause of
the species decline in the wild and erradicate or modify it. Suitable aviaries
would then be established in the right ecological sites for the important re-establish-
ment in the wild of the captive bred stock.
Alas in many (most?) countries this dream is unlikely to be realized. The
nearest to this utopia one can at present hope to reach is for all aviculturists, of
proven ability and who are interested in conservation work, to be registered with
Fauna conservation groups. The latter will surely not squander for ever the
opportunity of at least giving Aviculture the chance to prove its real value in
conservation work (greater longevity in adult breeding stock and greater survival
percentage in young reared in captive stock must mean swifter population growth).
Aviculture must improve its image and it should be the principal duty of the
Avicultural Society to do this. Greater encouragement should be given to the
establishment of aviary bred strains of Foreign and native species.
A register of species on the Red List kept by members and more important the
numbers of young bred from these species should be published in the Magazine
each year. This list should be submitted to leading ornithological and con-
servation journals with the request of publication.
Finally, many of our members no doubt contribute to the World Wildlife Fund;
could not these contributions be channelled via the Avicultural Society with the
particular request that rare avian species benefit?
I'm afraid I have used Mr. Marshall Boehm's idea to ride once again my hobby
horse of " Aviculture and Conservation " but I am sure that no one is more
equipped, if given the opportunity of breeding a rare species in confinement than
:he owners of the Edward Marshall Boehm Aviaries.

Readers may be interested to know of the consistent success we have had in
breeding Spreo Starlings in the Carnegie Dunfermline Trust's aviaries. From
the avicultural point the aviaries are very far from ideal. The birds get quite a
considerable amount of disturbance, as the public has a passage-way through the
shelter portion, even dogs are allowed. It is quite exasperating to see parent birds,
on the point of feeding with live food, suddenly freeze, owing to a dog appearing
in front of their cage: or, perhaps, a party of school-children screaming, shouting,
waving flags, etc., enter the shelter part of the aviary.
The first Spreo, believed to be a cock, was purchased in 1948. In 1952 three
more, which proved to be a cock and two hens, were purchased. In 1954, one
young one was bred, and further young were bred each year up to 1964. I never
managed to rear more than one or two young in a nest. Most of the trouble was
that 50%~75% of the young were lost a few weeks after leaving the nest, due to
gape-worms. One year I kept the parent birds shut in the shelter-shed, thinking
that gapes would'nt trouble them as the floor is concrete, but the young were
troubled just the same as before.
Mr. Tom Spence purchased a pair of Spreos from Foxwarren Park when the
collection was dispersed in 1955, and for several years successfully bred some
young ones. Almost four or five years ago I exchanged with him an aviary-bred
hen for an aviary-bred cock. In 1965 and 1966 I did'nt breed any young, having
lost the two hens I purchased in 1952. I tried putting together some of my others,
but it is often very difficult to know when one has a pair.
In 1967, from the cock I got from Tom Spence and a hen I bred in 1963, I
managed to rear a nest of three. I expected to lose one or two with gapes, but this
time, although they appeared to be affected, they all survived. Previously, the
young when troubled with gapes coughed and gasped in a distressing manner,
whereas on this occasion there was no gasping, only a great deal of coughing.
From time to time I have lost a few birds, due to accidents, fighting, escaping,
and unknown causes, but at present I have nine Spreos, all aviary-bred and, apart
from the cock (aviary-bred) I got from Tom Spence, I have never introduced any
others since I first started breeding them in 1954. I find that with our aviary-bred
birds, hens seem to be greatly in a minority.
I feel sure that had I been able to give the breeding pairs more privacy and
separate accommodation the results would have been very much better.

I have just had the misfortune to lose my Blue-cheeked Red-tailed Amazon
Parrot on 15th January, 1968, through old age and ill health, it lived for 10 years
with me and 2 or 3 years with its previous owner. I wish to thank Mr. Allen
Silver for helping me over it's feeding problems also it's periods of ill health, it
often used to fall off it's perch but it always recovered, till this last time. I have
just heard from Dr. Dean Amadon who is the Lamont Curator of birds in the
American Museum of Natural History, New York, U.S.A. There is a possibility
that it is rare owing to it's habitat being in the part of Brazil which is much cut
over and settled also, it is shy, but it is now regarded as conspecific with Amazona
duresiana Shaw which ranges all the way to the Guianas. I have never seen
another living specimen except my own bird though it has been kept in the
London Zoo along time ago, I have travelled over a great part of the world.

'STIMULITE' NECTAR FOOD is a COMPLETE NUTRI-
TIONAL food in highly concentrated form. It is highly
beneficial to all livestock, whether it be Humming Birds,
Sun Birds or other Nectarines, Insectivorous Birds, Fruit-
eaters, Canaries, Finches, Parrakeets, Parrots, or any kind
of animal. This supreme food should be available to
them at all times.
Recently there has been some advocacy of a sugar and protein diet for
Humming Birds, such a diet is very deficient in nutritional value.
PROTEIN is produced within the body by METABOLISM from the
nutrients in the food consumed. A diet, to be fully nutritional, has to
contain all the essential vitamins. A, D, E, C, and the full vitamin B
Complex, Bl, B2, B6, B12 (known as the animal-protein factor), the full
context contains Thiamin, Riboflavine, Nicotinic Acid, Pantothenic Acid,
Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Inositol, Choline and Biotin. Only a food
containing all of these can be termed COMPLETE.
Metabolism can only convert the food into protein if the food also
contains the following amino acids : Arginine, Histidine, Lysine,
Trypotophane, Phenylalanine, Methionine, Leucine, Isoleucine and
Valine. All these factors are necessary for a fully nutritional food, they
are not heresay, but SCIENTIFIC FACTS which can be verified.

present distribution of birds in the county. It is the first comprehensive
book on the subject to appear since 1869 and contains the first list of
Somerset birds to be compiled since 1901. The authors, both of whom
are members of the Editorial Committee (Ornithological Section) of
the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society, have written
the book principally to provide members of ornithological societies
with a badly needed work of reference as well as a readable and
informative guide of great general interest.
Somerset is particularly rich in its variety of bird-habitats and there is
much of interest to be found in the recent man-made changes in the
environment--the construction of reservoirs, the boom in tourism, and
agricultural development. A study of the effects of these changes has an
importance which is not limited to ornithologists within the county,
and the value of the analysis contained in this book has been enhanced
by the full use which the authors have made of the unusually large
amount of published data available since regular reports first appeared
in 1910.
All the different bird-habitats of the county's many physical regions are
described with the aid of photographs, and a list of all species known to
have occurred in Somerset since 1750 is given, with detailed notes on
their past and present distribution.
For the practising ornithologist a list of local natural history societies is
included, as well as a short history of ornithology in the county, a
select bibliography, and suggestions for further study.

With a Foreword by H R H The Duke of Edinburgh
The Galapagos, Pacific islands which lie six hundred miles west of
Ecuador, have always drawn naturalists by their abundant and largely
undisturbed wildlife, above all by their sea birds. Among the first and
most famous to describe them was Charles Darwin. Bryan Nelson, a
young ornithologist, and his wife spent a year on two uninhabited
islands of the group studying the wildlife. In this book Bryan Nelson
describes that year of almost undisturbed solitude (among their very
few visitors was the Royal Yacht Britannia with hrh The Duke of
Edinburgh on board) and their detailed investigations into the life
history and behaviour of the Pacific sea birds: white boobies, blue-foots
and red-foots, gulls, frigates and albatrosses, and the amazing colonies
of piqueros and guanay cormorants on the Peruvian Guano Islands.
This book makes a very real contribution to the study of bird behaviour
and cannot fail to interest both serious and amateur naturalists, indeed
all who have been fascinated by the discoveries of behavioural science.
Twenty-four pages of photographs and more than seventy drawings
illustrate the book.

This review of the progressive destruction of nature, particularly of
animal life, surveys the dismal history of the elimination of species and
examines some of the means at our disposal for preventing further
losses.
The author does not depend on mere appeal to sentiment. His
arguments are substantiated by factual evidence which clearly indicates
the need for corrective action. The examples given are presented with
the same basic reasoning: when man continues to destroy nature, he
saws off the very branch on which he sits since the rational protection
of nature is at the same time the protection of mankind.

(*Spreo superhus)
By Robin Restall (Copenhagen, Denmark)
The Spreo Starling was first imported into Britain as recently as 1923,
and Delacour (1925) probably writing in 1924 said of it, " . . . has just
been imported from East Africa; it is a gorgeous bird with bright greenish-
blue upperparts, orange-chestnut underparts, and a white bar across the
chest ". Even while he wrote, Alfred Ezra was busy in Surrey breeding
Spreo Starlings, and during 1924 his pair reared two broods, each of two
birds. (Ezra, 1924). He was subsequently awarded a first breeding
medal by the Avicultural Society.
However, Spreos were also bred at the Zoo in the same year, and other
successes were also recorded. So by the time that Delacour's words
appeared in print, they had a certain historical ring to them. By 1936,
D. H. Risdon was describing them as one of the easiest foreign softbills
to breed. I will leave to others to comment on the anachronistic nature
of my notes herewith, based on repeated unsuccessful breeding attempts
of Spreos I kept in 1966! But I do feel that if reports from members are
exclusively concerned with successful breedings--as most of them are--
then the literature must by sheer definition be incomplete and onesided.
For the reader who is not familiar with the natural history of the species,
I would like to preface my notes with some brief remarks:
Distribution
Restricted to East Africa, it ranges from central Ethiopia to the Somali
Republic, Southern Sudan, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania (Praed and
Grant, i960).
Habitat
It is a common species, widely distributed and fairly ubiquitous in
habitat. It seems to be primarily a bird of Savannah and scrub.
Food
Fairly omnivorous, feeding mainly on small fruits and insect life.

A gregarious and tame bird, not particularly put off by man. It
feeds on the ground in small parties, and is obviously easy to trap at the
waterholes.
Nest and eggs
The nest is either a spherical ball of grass surrounded with thorny
twigs and lined with feathers, placed low in a thorn tree, or it may be in a
hole or an adapted suitable nest from another species (Praed and Grant).
The eggs are clean, greeny-blue, and usually there are four of them. I
have rarely been without Spreos over the past seven or eight years.
Most of the pairs I have had have been both cocks, and I have had several
odd cocks. In 1966, I received a very good pair, in breeding condition,
that had made several attempts to breed the previous year. Their
previous owner had been bitten by the parrot-like bug and was casting
softbills to the winds left, right and centre for the sake of various parrakeets.
The following notes, and illustrations are based on the entries concerning
this pair in my aviaries diary from 8th April, 1966, through to September
of the same year. Certain comments though are qualified by other
experiences with this species.
Arrival and early tiesting behaviour
On the morning of 8th April, at 11.30, the Spreos were placed in an
outside flight, 12 ft. long x 3 ft. wide, (with a small shelter 3 ft. x 3 x
3 ft. in the birdroom attached). The flight, which had previously
housed Redrumps was occupied by a pair of Red-crested Black Tanagers
(Tachyphonus coronatus) and a cock Blue-grey Tanager ( Thraupis virens).
The Spreos had spent the winter in a cage and were obviously terribly
excited, leaping about and flying to and fro screaming and screeching.
By 5 o'clock that afternoon the Spreos were carrying straw around in
their bills, and harrying the Tanagers seriously. They were removed.
I could not identify the sexes on sight then, but it became clear subse-
quently that it was the hen who was carrying the straw, and the cock who
was doing the harrying. By dusk that evening the floor of the house
chamber was strewn with dead leaves, twiglets and straw. On the
morning of the 10th, I hung up an old Cockateil nesting-box (measuring
about 9 in. x 8 in. x 12 in.) with a well-chewed entrance hole in the flight.
This caused much excitement and the birds started nest building
immediately . The floor of the flight was thick with grass, but I added
handfuls of thin bendy twigs, wood wool and straw. I am too cynical
by now to believe that any birds of mine are serious when they start nest
building, so I affected a calm lack of concern with their hysterics, and
left them alone for a week.

Identifying the sexes
It is perhaps apposite here to explain the difference between the sexes
of this pair (and most pairs of Spreos, I think), because the notes that
follow hinge on this factor. The male differed in being bolder looking,
more retiring in my presence, less tame and, visually, by having a notice-
ably wider breast bar. This is shown in Figure i.
The nest construction
By 17th April, I looked into the nest-box (half expecting to see a brood
)f lusty chicks!) but found the nest half-built (Fig. 2 a). The cavity on
)ne side was shaping up nicely, although the base was still the wood of the
aox floor. There was a slight overlap at the top of the cavity. I recorded
urprise at the amount of material that the birds had used to produce
uch unspectacular results, so I gave much more.

11 6 R. RESTALL--THE SUPERB SPREO STARLING
A few days later I noticed the hen repeatedly sitting half in the box
with her tail outside, and made a sketch (Fig. 3). I thought she was
working on building the roof over the nest cavity, although there was
never any sign of movement. On the 21st, I listed the material which
had been given to the Spreos so far and this was:
thin twigs, scraps of wood wool, bits of spring, straw, a few odd
feathers, dead leaves, feathers, teased-out sisal string, carpet pickings
and fluff, a proprietary packet of canary nesting material, fluff from the
filter of the tumble-dryer, and a mass of long dogs hair.
On the 23rd, I examined the nest in some detail and was astounded at
its construction. There was a firm platform (the roof of the nesting
chamber) immediately below the entrance hole, then a short but distinct
tunnel twisted down and round into the nest cavity depression. It was
rather like a contorted retort. Ail of the material except the last in the
list above had been used, but in addition every nook and cranny had
been stuffed with grass to present a very warm and cosy snuggery. The
dogs hair had been used exclusively as a lining for the entire chamber and
had been so arranged as to present a smooth, silky surface (Fig. 2 b).
For the past week or so I had been watching these two very carefully
indeed and I am convinced that only the hen does any nest building at all.
Certainly the cock will pick up bits of material, but only so that he can
have something in his beak to sing about. It is soon dropped, or occa-
sionally passed to the hen. The hen collects as much as her bill will
hold before going to the box. However, on one occasion--a week later--
I did see the cock take a bit of straw into the nest. He was very reluctant
and shy. It was as if he was frightened rather than not knowing what to do.

<bodyText confidence="0.963189136363636" page_id="58089116"  page_num="117" year="" vol="">
My friend, Derek Goodwin, was visiting me on the 29th, and noticed
:he hen soliciting to the cock, but no copulation was seen. A couple of
Jays later I noticed a similar sequence. I am afraid I have no detailed
notes of this at all, the hen bird simply leaned forward slightly, raised her
tail slightly and drooped her wings a little in a fluttering movement.
The whole thing was almost momentary.
Eggs and brooding
My entry for the 7th May reads, " Five very warm eggs. Turquoise.
Almost certainly being brooded. Could kick myself for not getting
laying dates." On the 17th I found the eggs stone cold, each contained
a well developed chick around 11 days old. In my rush to feed and
check the aviaries on the previous morning, I had shut the adults into
their shelter to avoid their predictable displays of distress while I inspec-
ted the eggs and changed the water in the trough. I forgot to let them
out in the flight again! Mistakes like that are only made once, and I
blush to recall it now. By the 20th the hen was actively working on the
nest again, reinforcing the structure with much fine grass. On the 23rd
an egg was laid, on the 25th a second, and a third on the 26th. Two of
them hatched on Monday the 6th June, the third chick appeared on Wed-
nesday, the 8th, which is a difficult sum to work out, but anyway it gives
mean incubation of 12 days, with a possible variation of 11-14 days.
Later broods invariably hatched on a twelve/thirteen day basis.

I had scrupulously avoided entering the flight, and had only realised
that hatching had begun by noticing bits of eggshell on the ground at the
farthest possible point away from the nest. This proved to be the rule,
whatever aviary the birds were subsequently housed in.
One interesting point of behaviour is that the hen would frequently
get herself wet, in fact nearly soaking on all her underparts before entering
the nest to brood. Throughout the two years that I had this pair the
hen alone appeared to brood. She always had a good stretch (Fig. 4 )
after a spell in the nest.
Nestling period
From the start the parents appeared to be devoted and sound at their
job. The hen was much bolder at the feeding bowl than the cock, and,
in fact, did about 90% of the feeding. I very much wanted to release the
birds to forage for themselves at liberty. The risk of losing the male was
obvious, but I was sure I would keep the hen. However, I was dissuaded
by others, which I will always regret.
On the morning of the fourth day (the third chick was two days old)
all three were strong and begging vigorously. On the sixth day I made

the sketch for Figure 5. On the seventh day I examined each chick, and
they were clearly of different sizes. Their appetites were enormous, and
quite insatiable. The three chicks could always be found lying in an
arrowhead formation with all three beaks pointing in the same direction,
towards the tunnel. One day at around this time a grey squirrel was
playing around the aviaries and foraging in the thick grass around the
wire netting. Both Spreos clung to the wire alongside the animal and
seemed hypnotized by its presence. They alternately sung, whistled and
shrieked at it.
By the 8th day my mealworms had run out, and as every breeder will
know, the German breeders always go on strike or get diseased or some-

thing right in the middle of the season. (Thank heaven Mr. Coombes
is now breeding them in England!) So for a few days the birds were
restricted to maggots by the pint, and what else I could provide. My
office work suddenly became much greater and I had to rely on the
foraging abilities of the local children, but even 2d. each failed to produce
more than a dozen spiders and grasshoppers. The next morning the
smallest of the three young birds was found dead on the ground beneath
the nest.
On the morning of the 10th day, I had to fly to Scotland, not returning
until the evening of the 12th. Not surprisingly, the entire stock of
maggots had been consumed and none were left. The next smallest
chick was also dead on the ground.
On the 14th day I took the remaining youngster from the nest and drew
it (Figs. 6 and 7). It seemed a fine, happy and healthy bird, with no sign
of rickets, malnutrition, or any deficiency or abnormality. By this time,
I was lucky to spend more than ten minutes a day with all my birds due
to pressure of work, and was having to rely on mealworms and maggots for
live food. It became apparent that less live food was being taken, and the
hen would come and inspect the bowl, select just a few mealworms and
then fly off to the box. The cock was not even interested in mealworms
(Fig. 8).
I renewed my bribes to the local children, and at 3 d. each found three
spiders! On the 17th day, the last youngster was found dead.
Nest sanitation
On one occasion I saw one of the adults fly from the nest with a faece
in its beak. It flew to a large stone at the end of the flight, stepped to
the ground and proceeded to tuck the bright white thing in amongst the
long grass at what turned out to be exactly the farthest point from the
nest. The nest was kept scrupulously clean always.

In my experience, with this pair of Spreos--seven unsuccessful attempts
in all, over two years--feeding w^as the critical factor. The parents
quickly became bored with mealworms and maggots, only fed the latter
in the absence of mealworms, and never gave the youngsters (up to 3 weeks
old anyway) anything but live food. All three young of the fourth
brood (the third to hatch) died suffering from malnutrition gained from
a diet consisting entirely of maggots and mealworms. By then it was
impossible to find live insects in significant quantities.
The basic diet, and the one preferred by the Spreos even now, is
mealworms, maggots--fresh and fat, and maggot pupae--fresh and red,
diced pears, diced soft apple and fresh Sluis universal soft food. While
breeding the Universal was enriched with the protein-rich Befkin. The
water in the shelter contained stimulite, while in the flight the shallow
trough contained rainwater. During the first week of the above saga,
I noted that I fed them with mealworms, and maggots and whatever live
food I could get. The hen always took the mealworm pupae in preference
to the larvae. She usually took just as many as she could carry (Fig. 9).
On one day the tally went: 5 spiders, 15 woodlice, 8 beetles, 1 millipede,
1 earwig. And on another day my notes read: " Fed about 150 small
caterpillars collected from a Euonymus japonica bush, 30 ant pupae and
big fat butterfly chrysalis. All went very quickly. The first lot of half
the caterpillars w r ent in one beakful!! So did all the ant pupae. Hen
took them all, but cock did not even take one for himself. After all had
gone she then took some fresh mealworms. Very depressing. How am
I going to keep up this rate--and what about the other birds? " The
other birds made do with maggots.

When the Spreos were first introduced into their first aviary with the
three tanagers they certainly chased them a lot. Later on in the season
I moved them into a larger planted flight, 12 ft. x 9 ft. (with a 9 ft. x 3 ft. x
3 ft. shelter) which they shared with the tanagers and some American
buntings, a pair of canaries and a few other odd birds. There was a
box screwed to the wall which I could not be bothered to remove, thinking

the Spreos were out of condition having had three broods (two of which
hatched and were reared to 21 days). However, they built a nest in this
which I only discovered after some weeks. It was a wider box, and the
nest chamber was rather more complicated as a result (see Fig. 2 c).
Nothing really came of this nest; two eggs were laid and hatched but
with a reduced fervour and enthusiasm, and despite lavish supplies of
mealworms and maggots, which were fed on high protein baby foods,
dusted with PYM, etc., the young died with rickets in a fortnight. How-
ever, shortly afterwards the hen started patching the nest up for a fifth
brood. The cock must have come back into condition for he became
more vociferous, and slaughtered a male Lazuli Bunting ( Passerina cyana).
It happened literally while my back was turned a few seconds during a bird
watching spell. All the Spreos I have kept have been mixed with other
species for most of the time; the above incident was the only death but
not the only example of unreliability.
In my experience single birds, or pairs of the same sex, are safe with
anything, even Quail F&apos;inches and other estrildines. A true pair are best
kept alone or with birds significantly larger than them unless the owner is
prepared to run the risk of damage. I have one odd Spreo cock at the
moment, and he is in a large aviary (17 ft. x 12 ft. flight, 9 ft. x 12 ft.
shelter) with a few other odd birds including a pair of Chinese Crested
Mynahs ( Acridotheres cristatellus) which are the same size as the Hill
Mynah ( Gracula religiosa ). But when the food searching in the under-
growth or dead leaves seems to be going well the Spreo will see them off
just as a Blackbird sees off a sparrow from wanted food.
Diagnostic markings
The Spreo is distinguished by its snow-white vent and under tail-
coverts, and this area is frequently displayed after flight. The bird will

alight on a perch after a long flight and cock its tail up in the air the instant
after alighting--rather in the manner that a Blackbird will. The move-
ment is as slow, and seems quite deliberate. It is particularly noticeable
when a pair are together, but a single bird seems to do it much less
frequently, and the movement is refined and much less accented when
the bird is alarmed or apprehensive.
Song
The male Spreo will sing at great length, a loosely-strung series of
warbles, whistles and odd notes. The one I have at present has snatches
of Robin and Blackbird in his song, and some snatches of the canary's
trill. The natural song is actually more pleasant and is less incoherent.
Females appear to sing, but less often, and usually for the best reason the
male appears to have and that is when the crop is full and the sun is
shining. The bird settles down comfortably and warbles forth. I have
never seen the courtship display described by other writers.
Summary and conclusions
Superb Spreo Starlings are as willing to breed as their reputation
would have one believe. It is not easy to obtain a true pair as dealers
supply by the " each " method, and are not prepared to back their hunch
by an exchange or money back guarantee. Success is related primarily
to feeding, which must have variety in addition to quantity and quality.
The hen assumes most of the parental responsibilities, building the nest
and feeding the young. In the event of trouble no doubt she could be
relied upon to rear the young alone. It is suggested that the male could
be caged alongside the flight containing the nest, and the hen given liberty
to forage abroad for live food " on the hoof ". It is the author's intention
to try this on his return to the United Kingdom, in due course. Breeding
pairs are of uncertain temper and it is likely that the cock is the aggressive
one acting from a territory-defence stimulus rather than either or both
birds acting from a save-all-the-food-for-ourselves position. When not
breeding they are tractable, and odd birds, or numbers of the same sex,
are safe in mixed collections.

By A. H. Isenberg (Portola Valley, Calif., U.S.A.)
Seven years ago I had pairs of Hartlaub's and Knysna Touracos, then
about 1962 one of each pair died apparently in perfect condition. The
remaining two birds were in adjoining aviaries and I noticed much
" billing " between them a few days later. Upon allowing Hartlaub's in
with Knysna the two birds became very friendly and within a week were
building a nest. This aviary is about 10 ft. by 20 ft. and 8 ft. high plus
a shelter which extends approximately 5 ft. into a greenhouse. In this
shelter I fastened a flat-bottom basket some 6b ft. from the ground and this
the birds took to the next day adding only a few twigs. Soon one egg was
laid and in two days the second. Incubation was approximately 22 days
as best I could estimate as the adults sat very tightly. The young hatched
at two-day intervals and were rather grotesque little black " Dodo-like "
creatures with a little dark down. Both parents incubated, and tenderly
cared for their offspring, sitting very tightly to excess it seemed.
One young was perfect, but the other succumbed in five days with both
legs broken at the hips and the bird quite flattened out. The good one
also died a few days after leaving the nest.
During the next two years the pair had over 20 eggs, most of which
hatched, but the young always had their legs broken at the hip thus
becoming useless and dying time after time.
The pair was moved into a very large aviary (60 x40 x12 ft.) well
planted, but again the birds selected a basket in the large shelter room
about 10 ft. off the ground. Here again more of the same tragedy.
I thought the parents sat too long and too tightly on the young. After
the third failure here in 1965 I was fortunate in taking two young at
10 and 12 days old and rushed them over to the Eric Kinseys where
Mrs. Kinsey applied her most expert skill of rearing birds and did a
simply marvellous job of bringing these two Touracos to maturity. The
first hand-reared Touracos I have seen and both birds remained delight-
fully tame. Nestling Touracos are very " flabby ", absolutely limber and
feel rather boneless but yet quite heavy.
Two more attempts were made that year but with the same tragic
results.
The two young, after almost two years, are still very tame and when I
enter the aviary and in a high pitched voice say " Papayapapaya " they
become very excited and try coming through the wire to get their favourite
fruit. The two birds started fighting and had to be separated and I think
they are males.
In 1966 the adults were again moved into another large aviary
(60 x 20 x 10 ft.) without a heated shelter and here they were forced to

build their own nest which they did in short order. Touracos build a
rather loose nest of twigs similar to doves but somewhat larger.
In this aviary more young were hatched with the same tragic end
except for one young which they reared very well from the third nesting.
The same nest was used for these several broods. This was at last the
success I had hoped for.
In 1967 only two attempts were made and none hatched. Only two
eggs are laid for each nesting. The adults are still together and they
nested almost throughout the year even in December, January and
February, our coldest season, with temperature down to 28* F. at times
during night and early morning. Thousands of mealworms were taken
by the adults, especially by the male Hartlaub, which were fed to the young
by regurgitation. Some rainworms were also taken and the Hartlaub's
was seen many times on the ground searching for insects. The eggs and
young were rarely exposed as the parents would exchange duty immediately.
The birds had access to fruits at all times, grapes, apple, etc. The adults
also ate much of my hard-boiled egg mixture which consists of one part
each of bran and toasted wheat germ and three parts of hard-boiled egg
which is put through a coarse sieve and then gently mixed with the bran
and wheat germ. Pound cake is also relished and some soaked currants
and raisins; greens are also taken such as lettuce and grass. Blueberries
and papaya are a great treat.
The fully adult offspring of this hybrid look more like Hartlaub's than
Knysna, the crest being quite taller than Hartlaub's with white tips.
They also have the white spot above the bill as in Hartlaub's and the white
streak under the eye; the whole bird is greener and altogether if anything a
prettier bird than Hartlaub's.
I have not heard of this hybrid before and would be interested to know
how many other Touraco hybrids have occurred.

By A. A. Prestwich (Edenbridge, England)
The opening paragraph of the preface to Walter Scheithauer's Humming-
birds (reviewed by " E. H." in the Magazine, 1968, p. 33) states: " The
first live humming bird to arrive in Europe was a Sparkling Violet-ear
(Colibri coruscans) which was exhibited in 1905 at the Zoological Gardens
in Regent's Park, London. For fourteen days it created a sensation and
the many visitors who saw it were filled with astonishment and wonder.
Then it died. It had presented more problems to science than any other
known bird. Practically nothing was understood about its care and
management; the correct food was certainly not known. Under these
circumstances it was not possible to keep this exceptionally beautiful bird
alive ". This statement needs correcting in that while a humming bird
was exhibited to the public in 1905, probably for the first time, it was not
the first to reach England alive. The following are the available reports,
in the main genuine, but two perhaps somewhat imaginary.
E. A. Porter (1906) tells us: " In the Library of the Zoological Society are
the original drawings by Hayes, with a manuscript title page as follows:
' Rare and Curious Birds accurately drawn and beautifully coloured from
specimens in the Menagerie at Osterly Park,' the size is folio and it is
dated 1782, although some of the drawings bear earlier dates than this,
and in it are figured three species of Humming Birds. The volume also
contains a few other birds not figured in his work of 1794."
William Hayes (1729-1799) was a zoological artist blessed with a very
large family, no less than twenty-one children. His drawings from the
Osterley Park Menagerie were made with the co-operation of his family--
seven of his children being involved in the project.
The Osterley Park Menagerie, Middlesex, was quite extensive. It was
owned by Robert Child, of banking fame. Hayes drew in the main from
living models, but one cannot help wondering whether one of his numerous
assistants did in fact produce the humming bird plate from skins.
The following account will surely be read with a mixture of amusement
and reserve. John Latham (1822), writing under the heading Mango
Humming-bird, says: " The circumstance of keeping Humming-Birds
alive in their own climate, by means of sugar and water, is well authenti-
cated, and the following fact is also well attested. A young Gentleman,
a few days before he sailed from Jamaica for England, met with a female
Humming-Bird sitting on the nest and eggs, and cutting off the twig,
he brought all together on board. The bird became sufficiently tame,
so as to suffer herself to be fed with honey and water during the passage,
and hatched two young ones. The mother, however, did not long survive,
but the young were brought to England, and continued for some time in
the possession of Lady Hamond. The late Sir H. Englefield, Bart, and
Hans Sloane Stanley, Esq. both witnesses of the circumstance, informed

ne, that these little creatures readily took honey from the lips of Lady H.
vith their bills; one of them did not live long, but the other survived at
east two months from the time of their arrival. I am not positive of its
&amp;gt;eing the precise species I have arranged it under, but am inclined to
hink so, from the description of the parent bird, and especially as it
s the most common one found in that Island."
When we come to John Gould we are on firm ground. In 1857 he
mported a Ruby-throated. Gould (1861) says he " succeeded in bringing
living pair within the confines of the British Islands, and a single indi-
idual to London, where it lived two days ..."
In P.Z.S. (1857) there is a note to the effect that Mr. Gould gave details
*f his observations on Trochilus in the United States. " When captured
t so speedily becomes tame that it will feed from the hand or mouth within
alf an hour. Successful in keeping one alive during a long railway journey,
a a gauze bag attached to his breast button, for three days, during which
t readily fed from a small bottle filled with a syrup of brown sugar and
rater, Mr. Gould determined to attempt the bringing of some living
xamples to England, in which he succeeded, but unhappily they did not
ang survive their arrival in London, and died on the second day: had they
ived, it was his intention to have sent them to the Society's Gardens,
/here they would doubtless have been objects of great attraction ".
An account by Gould is reproduced in Cassell&apos;s Book of Birds (1869-
873): "A Trochilus colibris captured for me by some friends pumped
he fluid from a little bottle whenever offered it, and in this manner it
ved with me a constant companion for several days, travelling in a
:ttle, thin gauze bag, distended with whalebone, and suspended to a
&apos;Utton of my coat. It was only necessary for me to take the bottle in my
and to induce it to thrust its spiny bill through the gauze, protrude its
mgthened tongue down the neck of the bottle, and pump up the fluid till
; was satiated; it would then fly to the bottom of its little home, preen its
ail and wing feathers, and seem quite content.
" The specimens I brought alive to this country were as docile and
sarless as a great moth under similar treatment. The little cage in
/hich they lived was twelve inches long, seven wide, and eight high. In
his was placed a diminutive twig, and suspended to the side a glass phial,
/hich I daily supplied with saccharine matter in the form of sugar or
oney and water, with the addition of the yolk of an unboiled egg. Upon
his food they appeared to thrive and be happy during the voyage along
he seaboard of America and across the Atlantic, until they arrived within
he influence of the climate of Europe. The vessel in which I made the
assage took a northern course, which carried us over the banks of New-
Dundland, and although the cold was rather severe during part of the time,
he only effect it appeared to have upon my little pets was to induce a
ind of torpidity, from which they were rapidly aroused by placing them
1 the sunshine, in the bosom, or near a fire. 1 do assure my readers that

128 A. A. PRESTYVICH--EARLY IMPORTATIONS OF HUMMING BIRDS
I have seen these little creatures cold, stiff, and to all appearances dead, and
that from this state they were readily restored by a little attention and
removal into light and heat, when they would ' peck up ', flutter their
tiny wings, and feast away as if in the best state of health
David Seth-Smith (1906) writes: " . . . another record is reported by
Mr. Pocock in the Field of December 9th, 18&amp;quot;. He writes: ' Since the
question of the importation of Humming Birds is under discussion it
seems a pity not to record the fact that in July, 1894, eleven specimens of
Trochilus cornutus, which I presume to be the Heliactin cornuta of Sclater
and Salvin's list, were brought over on the s.s. Nile and bought by Mr.
Arthur W. Arrowsmith, who sold them to the late Mr. Erskine Allon, of
Gray's Inn ".
Before proceeding to deal with Major Pam's several importations,
1905--1907, it might be as well to mention two or three other reports of
about that time.
David Seth-Smith (1906), following a report by the Rev. Hubert D.
Astley, had some correspondence with Miss Alary Cholmondeley regarding
a number of Humming Birds kept alive by her uncle Air. Cholmondeley,
of Condover, Shropshire, "many years ago". Miss Cholmondeley did
not herself see the birds which she says her uncle imported in large num-
bers, but her father, the Rev. R. H. Cholmondeley, and one of her sisters
remembered seeing them alive. Miss Cholmondeley wrote: " We believe
them to have been genuine Humming Birds--on this point we have never
had any doubt. They mostly either died on the journey or soon after
arrival. The great difficulty was the food. I have heard my uncle
speak of that difficulty, but not of how he solved it. But as, in spite of
repeated trials the birds always died, I fear he did not solve it."
The Rev. H. D. Astley (1906) also reported: " When paying a visit in
March [1906] to Professor Giacinto Alartorelli, the head of the Natural
History Museum of Alilan ... he told me that some few years ago several
Humming Birds were kept in Alilan in captivity for several months, and
that they used to hover fearlessly round anyone's face and feed from the
hand. Professor Alartorelli himself saw them, and described it as the
most lovely sight imaginable, adding that the beautiful little creatures
remained in perfect health for some considerable time ".
Publication of the foregoing induced Giulie Tommasi Baldelli (1906),
of Florence, Italy, to describe the visit of a lady a month or two previous.
He writes: " . . . her first exclamation was " How can you say that
Humming Birds cannot live in captivity? I have kept them for some
time." Naturally I plied her with questions and she told me that when
she lived in the Argentine Republic she found a nest of unfledged Hum-
ming Birds and placed it in a trap-cage. The mother fluttered round it
in despair till she found the entrance to it, when she soon settled on the
nest and was captured with her young. They were fed on sugar melted

ingenious device for cultivating small midges for them. She kept a
barrel of fruit in the room, and as the fruit fermented with the heat of the
room it gave birth to numberless midges, which the birds devoured.
The young ones flourished and grew till they could not be distinguished
from the parent bird, and lived happily for several months. She succeeded
in bringing them over to Milan, where they lived for two months more and
were quite tame. She showed me a series of photographs of the lovely
tiny creatures perched on her finger or hovering over a flower, and told
me how she had nursed them and how fearless and tame they were.
They could not stand the motion of a carriage, and she had to walk from
the ship to the Hotel, holding them in the hollow of her hand ". Baldelli
ends on a prophetic note: " Who knows but that in a few years time
Humming Birds may be not only brought over, but bred and reared in
Europe? "
Possibly just a few of our members will remember the excitement that
must have been caused by the series of importations by Captain (late Major)
Albert Pam, in 1905-1907. The arrival of a living Humming Bird at
the Zoological Gardens was an event of great avicultural interest and
importance. The bird, a Bolivian Violet-eared Petasophora iolata,
arrived at the Gardens on 25th November, 1905. David Seth-Smith
(1906) has told us: " During the train journey from Southampton every
effort was made to keep the bird warm, by placing foot-warmers, etc. round
the cage, but in spite of all care, on arrival it was in a state of collapse
from the cold; but it immediately recovered when placed in a warm place
by the hot-water pipes in the Insect House. At a meeting of the Zoological
Society on November 28th, Captain Pam gave an interesting account of
his attempt to import living Humming Birds. They are caught by the
Natives with limed twigs, and many attempts have been made to keep them
in captivity in Venezuela, but with very limited success. Capt. Pam
fed his Humming Birds on sugar and water to which was added a certain
amount of extract of meat as a substitute for insects; and this treatment
succeeded well. He started from Venezuela with some half-dozen of
these birds, all of which had lived with him for some time before starting.
On arrival at Southampton one only survived. This bird lived for a
fortnight in the Insect House, but in spite of every attention, succumbed
during the recent damp, foggy weather ".
During June, 1906, Captain Pam brought home four more Humming
Birds, all of which died within a day or two of their arrival at the Zoological
Gardens.
On 27th May, 1907, the brothers Albert and Hugo Pam succeeded in
landing twenty Humming Birds which were deposited at the Zoological
Gardens. The last to survive, a Prevost's Mango, died on 3rd July. The
Pams (1907) state that " this bird was caught about a fortnight before it
left Venezuela, and the voyage took sixteen days, we can roughly state
that it was in captivity for about nine weeks." Thirty-three birds had

In the Light of its Natural Background.
By Professor Carl Naether (Encino, California, U.S.A.)
In keeping wild doves for avicultural purposes, there is too frequently
strong temptation to take them more or less for granted--captive birds,
f possible to be bred successfully--and little more. Whether from lack
&amp;gt;f interest or effort, or both, their keeper makes in many cases little or no
ttempt to acquaint himself with his birds' behaviour in their native
taunts. He fails to realize that even a limited grasp of dependable
&amp;gt;ackground information would render their keeping to him personally,
nore interesting, more meaningful, and often also more resultful so far
s breeding is concerned. Such basic background data are usually
vailable in ornithological literature, past and present. I am tempted to
ssert that obtaining and using such information is requisite for an
ntelligent and enjoyable maintenance of wild doves (and other birds)
n captivity.
As an illustration, let us now consider some more or less essential and
nteresting aspects in the natural life of the Western White-winged Dove,
vhich is, largely owing to its prolificness, seen frequently in aviaries,
rhis prolificness, combined with an unastonishing, somewhat plain, appear-
nce has prompted many a keeper to characterize this species as dull and
ommonplace, hence hardly worth cultivating.
But there is a good deal in the behaviour of the Western White-winged
)ove, as revealed by its life in the wild, which if known to its keeper is
ikely to make him or her more appreciative of its overall qualities as a
lesirable aviary bird, one to be observed and perhaps even treasured,
iuch information is bound to enhance the daily satisfaction of keeping this
tandsome dove and greatly to enrich the owner's experience. Moreover,
ts use will lift the species out of its often unjustly assumed commonplace-
less, lending it the delightful individuality which it exhibits.
So far as size goes, the White-winged Dove, 11-12J in. long, is similar
0 our Mourning Dove (Zenaidura macroura marginella ), but somewhat
leavier. This chiefly olive-brown bird with the bluish-grey rump, the
inaceous purple top of head and neck, has what no other dove has, a
arge, conspicuous white patch on the wing. Its rounded tail has a wide,
vhite band at the tip. Like the Mourning Dove, the White-wing has
&amp;gt;rown dashes near the ears and on the sides of the neck. The glimmering
rridescence of the neck and the distinctive black-and-white tail-band lend
his dove a beauty all its own. Young white-wings in juvenal plumage,
vhile in general resembling their elders, are paler, with back and breast
;reyer, and throat and sides of the head whiter.

The White-wing takes wing rather noisily, somewhat like a domestic
pigeon. Once airborne, however, its flight becomes soundless. Male
birds have often been observed, as in the Arizona desert where this species
is plentiful, to join in spectacular display flights. Thus, a sizeable flock
leaving the tops of the mesquite trees, one of their favourite roosts, will
rise forty to fifty feet above the desert floor, then suddenly set their wings
and scale around in a wide circle, somewhat in the manner of starlings and
domestic pigeons. Quickly they will return to the mesquites, there to
emphasize their presence by singing. The Mexicans call the White-wing
Dove Paloma cantador , the Singing Dove, and they have been known to
cage it for its musical voice. Usually the dove sings with closed eyes,
revealing a blue eye-lid, and with closed beak, in other words through the
nose! The White-wing's song has been interpreted variously, and has
been praised as being sonorous, pleasing, and musical. Some of the
notes have been translated as " Who cooks for you? ", " Cooks for two ",
and " Cook-kara-coo ". No two observers interpret the song or songs
alike. While singing, the male will throw his wings upward and forward
above the head, at the same time spreading his tail slightly. He has two
more or less distinct songs: one rather harsh, the other soft and musical,
and longer. Male White-wings do not sing in unison, but the final effect
of a large congregation voicing their joie de vivre is a single sound.
Alexander Wetmore, keen observer of this species, comments in part as
follows on the song: ''Although males did not coo in unison, the effect
provided by hundreds of them calling at the same time was remarkable.
Save for one or two birds nearby, their notes seemed to come from a
distance, and were so blended that it was difficult to pick out individual
songs. In a large colony, the volume of sound was so profound that it
carried readily for a distance of a mile, and yet the tone produced was so
soft that it was not deafening when near at hand. On the contrary, the
whole formed an undertone, continuous, and to my ear not unpleasing.
The effect, as a whole, was most remarkable, and once experienced,
lingers long in one's memory."
The natural food of the White-wing Dove consists of berries, waste
grain, weed seeds, mesquite beans, and some insects. Its favourite food
in the Arizona desert with its wild, coarse splendours and lurking thirst,
hunger, and other enemies, is the juicy, scarlet-skinned fruit which the
Indians call pitahaya. Moreover, in season the purple drupes of the
spiny shrub Condalia spathulata , as well as the fruits of the giant cactus
saguaro , which lifts its enormous branches more than thirty feet into the
sun-drenched desert air, are very much to the White-wing's liking.
Fields of barley and wheat, recently cut, attract this bird in immense
numbers, especially where the stubble was cut high, thus providing
shelter for the foraging doves. While feeding, they are alert to the
slightest movement round about. Comments Dr. Wetmore, well-known
authority: "At times I crawled up under the shelter of woods to watch

the White-wings at close range. If one of the feeding birds happened
to notice some slight motion, the heads of all were up in an instant and all
remained stockstill, while in a minute or so, they flew off hastily in sudden
alarm . . . When wheat was not threshed shortly after it was cut, these
doves often caused serious damage to the grain in the shock. This was
particularly true in the case of isolated fields that remained after the
surrounding crops had been harvested and removed. For this reason
the White-wings were in bad repute among many ranchers." For a time
their destruction by hunters and ranchers assumed such proportions as to
threaten extinction of this splendid species. Fortunately, it was saved
from this unhappy fate by the enactment of the Federal Migratory Bird
Law, which regulates the hunting season and otherwise protects this
dove. Being migratory, the White-wing is today kept by aviculturists
by special permit.
In nature, the White-wing Dove nests in shrubs and trees at an average
height of ten feet, exceptional cases ranging from four to twenty-five feet.
It prefers mesquite wherever available, but will use willow and even
:ottonwood trees. A brooding White-wing is extremely cautious, seldom
tolerating a man's approach as close as fifteen feet before taking sudden
light. Grass, weed stems and sticks, and straws provide the nest materials.
Two eggs, varying in colour from a rich, creamy buff to a pale, creamy
white, or almost all-white, are incubated approximately eighteen days,
30 th parents apparently taking part in the incubation. The nestlings,
ilmost black and covered with long, straggling down, are fed by regurgita-
tion. At the age of only four days, they receive in addition to the pigeon
' milk " solid, undigested seeds. Usually they will leave the nest when
hey are between three and four weeks old, perching for several days in
he thin shade of the mesquites, then gradually running about on the
&amp;gt;andy desert floor. They seem not to suffer from an often heavy infesta-
ion of ticks, which are rarely found on mature birds.
Once the young are well-grown, they will congregate with their elders
n large flocks; seven hundred and more have been observed in a single
light, flying from the feeding grounds to the waterholes. At a steady
)ace they will make a 60-mile flight daily. It is claimed that no bird
:xcept the Jacksnipe has so zigzagging a flight as the White-wing Dove,
which therefore is difficult to shoot.
In captivity, once accustomed to its keeper and surroundings, the
Vhite-wing Dove, when treated with patience and consideration, will
)reed quite readily. A variety of wild-grass seeds, as well as milo and
nillet, with the addition of the usual bird grit, will keep this lively bird
n good health and breeding condition. It has been crossed successfully
vith other doves.

By David Reid-Henry (Woodford, London, England)
Cliche though the title be, it has not been given without reason. How
it has come to be applied to the Crowned Hawk-Eagle Stephanoaetus
coronatus in the first instance, or by whom, is probably not precisely
known; but it is said to be a name certain African tribes have given to it.
The Leopard is a sinister beast who hunts by stealth the monkeys and
other animals on which it feeds and this species of eagle has a similar
.
reputation.
It is a bird that lives in well-wooded country, even heavy rain forest;
but is seldom found in open savannah. There are other African eagles to
be found in this latter but these would not make their homes in such heavy
bush or forest as the Crowned Eagle might choose. On the other hand
it is quite easy to find country where any species can, and does establish
itself. In Kenya Mr. Leslie Brown has ideal opportunities to study
several types of eagles, large and small as well as Peregrine Falcons all
within moderately easy reach of each other. His book on eagles, and
his writings on the Crowned Eagle in The Ibis make very interesting
reading, for his careful observations have given him a wide knowledge
of intimate details about the life of these birds.
It can be safely said that the species is to be found in any part of Africa
where the habitat is right. One must not expect to meet it in arid places
or where intensive civilisation has taken control, but broadly speaking one
can say that where there are monkeys of a tree-living type, there one may
well find the Crowned Eagle not too far away. This is not to say of course
that the eagles must have monkeys, but it is a fact that monkeys and these
eagles prefer the same sort of country. Leslie Brown tells us that the
individuals with whom he is particularly familiar prefer suni--a small
type of antelope--as their principal quarry. On the other hand the ones
the writer has had under observation definitely kill more monkeys than
anything else, as far as one can see from remains at the nest.
The hunting behaviour of this bird in general terms is very similar to
that of a Goshawk. That is to say the bird will have a territory in which
there will be a number of favourite " stands " from which it can cover a
good deal of ground by observation. On each of these perches the eagle
will spend time watching for movement. If there is nothing of interest
in sight after a period of patient, silent scrutiny it will fly on to another
stand and try again, and so the round of its territory will be covered.
At some point there will be a sign for which the bird has waited, and the
turning of a dead leaf on the forest floor will show the patient watcher
that the prey for which it is looking is stirring underneath, unaware of the
murderous predator's presence.

The eagle, if an old or incapacitated bird, or if it is inordinately hungry
will not always wait to identify the cause of the movement and will launch
its attack unwisely. I suspect that possibly quite a number of them meet
their end by attacking such a thing as the tip of a leopard's tail, or other
animal which can well prove too much for the bird. Eagles and other
predatory creatures do not as a rule die of old age: they die of accident,
poison, shot, trap, or are victims of their own indiscretions. For example,
the Martial Eagle, which is similar in size and strength to the Crowned
Eagle--although with a much greater wingspan, will sometimes interfere
with lions on a kill and " mob " the killer. The lion will not put up
with these attentions for very long and will spring into the air and strike
at its tormentor. If the eagle has misjudged its stoop and happens to
fall foul of one of those slashing blows it may fly away but in all probability
it will soon succumb to the injuries received and die. There is seldom
room for repentance of folly or mistake in Nature's book of rules.
A troop of monkeys in a tree are ever on the watch for the approach of
an enemy. So the eagle early learns the value of strategy in its use of
cover when flying to outwit the vigilance of its prey.
There was an occasion in Rhodesia when my own Crowned Eagle was
carried forth for what I hoped would be a day's sport early on in her career.
I and my three companions climbed one of those peculiar piles of vast
rounded boulders known as " kopjes " which are a feature of that splendid
country. We hoped to see some monkeys to give the eagle a good trial
over the kind of country where she might easily be hunting if she were a
wild bird. Sure enough a troop appeared on the other side of a vlei
in the tree-tops about a quarter of a mile away. Tiara saw them as soon
as she was unhooded and started from my fist in fine style. How r ever, at
the first beat of her wings the monkeys hurriedly scrambled down the
trees and vanished from our sight. Tiara arrived on the scene a few
seconds too late and pitched on a dead bough which stood convenient to
her and we could see her clearly looking about her in a puzzled fashion.
She was at this time completely without experience.
I left her in her tree while we hastened down the kopje and ran as well
as we could across the intervening vlei to the kopje on which the trees
grew where the monkeys had lately been disporting themselves. I could
see Tiara still on her stand but there was neither sight nor sound of her
intended quarry. All had decamped, but where had they gone? This
clump of trees was somewhat isolated and their nearest neighbours were
a hundred yards away. I think those monkeys were probably all hiding
either in the rocks, or perhaps a hollow tree of which they had fore-
knowledge. Certainly they were " not at home ", so I called Tiara down
to the fist and carried on with our walk.
The passing of time showed her that she had to be much more subtle
in her approach to living wild things and she learned the importance of
" using the ground " to get the advantage of surprise in her attack.

One might ask how it is that she was so easily outwitted. The answer
lies in the fact that human training of a bird of prey falls very far short of
the training she would receive in the wild state from her parents. For one
thing, the adult birds keep on feeding their offspring for a much longer
period than would Golden Eagles and the young bird is not driven away
from the nest area possibly for as long as a year or more. A lot depends
on the readiness of a good food supply. If food becomes short for any
reason the young will not be fed by the parents as they feel the pinch
increasingly themselves. Consequently the young bird is earlier induced
to wander afield and forage for itself, thus speeding its own independence.
If food is plentiful the young tend to keep reliance on their parents.
This matter of food availability controls the breeding to the extent that if
prey is not easy to find, the adults will often not receive sufficient stimulus
to set about home-building at all.
If, however, nesting is completed and eggs are laid, usually only one of
two eaglets will survive for very long. The reason for this is that the
stronger will eat the weaker as soon as it is capable of carrying out the
necessary murder. Or, sometimes the parents themselves will kill one
chick in order to feed the other! Or one will die because the other is
more importunate in its demands for food than the first, and as this one
gets weaker from lack of sustenance, so it is more likely to get ignored at
feeding time. Nature does not concern herself with the weak or ailing:
she is only interested in the survival of the strong.
" To him that hath, shall be given more, so that he shall have abundance;
but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that he hath." The
inexorable law of life in the wild!
Crowned Eagles build a nest of branches and sticks high up in a big
tree. At first it may measure only about four feet in diameter but every
time it is used other material is added until the size reaches enormous
proportions over the years. It may not always be the home of Crowned
Eagles: in some years it may be borrowed by someone else and adapted
to serve their own family requirements. Certain well-known nests or
eyries have been regularly occupied for very many years by generations
of eagles of different kinds.
The nests with which I am acquainted are all situated in big trees
growing out of the banks of streams and are sited so that they are sheltered
from strong sunlight but overlook a wide area of country of fairly well-
wooded character. The immediate neighbourhood consists of riverine
vegetation: tall mountain acacia, brachystegia, various figs and a good thick
undergrowth of tangled thorn and long grass. Huge lianas twist and turn
about the forest floor and stretch up their tendrils into the foliage above
where they are used by all the arboreal people who might find them of use
as swings, perches or for any of a thousand purposes to suit their whim.
But I have never seen any of these lianas in the trees holding a Crowned
Eagle's nest. Moreover, all these trees are difficult to climb, and I wonder

if this is a feature taken into account when the nest site is decided. I do
not know. But I feel the density of foliage in the tree is of some
importance. None are thickly shaded, but all are covered well enough to
prevent the full glare of the sun from reaching the nest. Even in my
garden in England where Tiara lives on a ring perch I have to provide
shade in the summer from what passes for sunlight, or she very soon
show&apos;s signs of getting restive and uncomfortable.
In the wild state much of the heat of the day is spent sitting in a shady
tree and looking at the landscape. As appetite makes itself felt the eagle
turns its attention to the task of finding a meal. When conditions are
right and the first breeding urges stir, the pair will spend much time
soaring at a vast height together in the cool air. They indulge in much
aerial play by stooping at each other and rising again on a thermal current.
This behaviour may go on for several weeks before any serious attention is
paid to nesting. Then a few repairs are made to the nest and some new
green leaves brought to the site and the male starts presenting the female
with food at the nest. If all goes well, mating will take place and serious
family affairs proceed. If for any reason the sequence of events is
seriously disrupted it is likely that no breeding w&apos;ill take place until much
later in the year or even not at all.
But let us get acquainted with this very magnificent bird. In size it can
be compared with a Golden Eagle, but this statement has to be qualified.
The Golden Eagle's wing is longer, but it is much less broad. Its tail is
much shorter and its feet are not as powerful as those of the Crowned
Eagle. In weight the two are probably very similar, but in character,
mode of life and behaviour they are very different. The Crowned Eagle
is really best likened to an enormously overgrown Goshawk. All its
behaviour is like that of a Gos: it hunts and kills in just the same way and
it has the nervous temperament of a Gos. Unlike the Golden Eagle the
young bird is very different in appearance from the adult and in its first
year it is a very beautiful bird indeed.
The head is creamy white with a few&apos; dusky feathers on top; and pro-
truding from the crown and nape is a pronounced crest of broad, not
over-long feathers each with a black spot near the end. This crest is
raised at the slightest disturbance and becomes a lovely tiara when fully
spread. It serves as a means of any emotional expression whether excite-
ment, anger, fear or threat and is frequently accompanied by an extreme
belligerence in demeanour.
The mantle, scapulars, w&apos;ings and tail are a beautiful grey with each
feather tipped with w&apos;hite and with a black subterminal patch. I he tail
has five black bars and the primaries and secondaries also are similarly
marked.
The breast is creamy white with the centre of each feather warm buff.
This colour becomes stronger under the wings w&apos;here the smaller coverts are
orange-chestnut. The larger underwing coverts are white with a black spot

in the terminal centre of each and the underside of the flight feathers
have a silvery quality between the black bars. The belly and undertail
coverts are creamy white with a few small dark markings, especially on the
flanks. The " trousers " are white with heavier dark markings.
The adult plumage compared with the glory of the first year bird is very
disappointing! It is acquired fully after three moults when the bird
is in its fourth year. The head is now dark brown, with the crest white
at the base and tip but otherwise appearing mainly black when not erect.
Then it is distinctly black and white. The sides of the head and throat
appear greyish dark brown. This deepens in colour until the breast and
back and all the wing-coverts on the upper side are glossy black. The
tail is still grey but the bars are now only four and much broader. The
primaries and secondaries are now mostly grey with black ends.
The belly is closely, heavily barred black and white with a suggestion
of rufous colouring on the pale parts. The feathers of the heavily
muscled, powerful legs are now closely spotted and barred with black and
white. Under the wings the coverts are now much deeper rufous in
colour, and the flight feathers are less heavily barred on their white
ground with black than are those of the juvenile. The bill is not long,
but strongly curved and black in colour. The eyes are pale greenish-ivory
colour and the gape and feet are rich bright yellow. Cere is black not yellow.
The toes are short and immensely powerful with fearsome talons that
perfectly set the bird off for the killer it is.
This, then, is a somewhat sketchy portrait of the lady I take up on my
fist every day. She is now nine years old and has been with me since the
February day in 1961 when I picked her up from underneath a bush.
She had thought to hide from unknown, discordant noises, and disturbing
happenings that had suddenly surrounded her lofty home in the great tree
by a dried up stream.
For some ten days previously strange things had occurred. She was
at an age when eagles take a keen interest in their environment. The
great birds she knew as her parents no longer spent much time in the
eyrie-tree, but she could see them as they circled in the air at a great height
and once or twice a day they came in and dropped the mangled corpse
of a monkey or a rock hyrax on the well-trodden platform of the nest
before taking to the air again. If their visit was in the evening they would
not fly far, but would go to one of their favourite look-out points across
the valley and spend a leisurely half-hour preening before retiring to their
roosting places.
But if they came at all in the morning it would be early, and then they
would fly away to spend the day either sitting in a leafy tree or soaring
together, watching the disturbing things that were happening in the
vicinity of their nest far below.
The eaglet also watched. Men were moving about near the tree and a
strange unwelcome shape began to rear its height not far away. However,

at this age eagles are philosophical birds and as matters appeared to settle
down again and the unwelcome noises stopped, so she ceased to feel any
alarm and returned to her routine of exercising her young, but nearly
full-grown wings. Much of her time was spent just gazing about her, or
in preening, or in ridiculous attempts to catch the hordes of flies that
covered the rotting carcase of a monkey brought the morning of the
previous day. Occasionally she would leave the nest and settle for a
while on a convenient branch in a nearby tree. Then she would indulge
in a fine exhilarating period of furious wing-flapping. This would be
followed by a time of sleep in the heat of the day and only the buzzing of
the insect hordes gave her any annoyance. So she passed her time and
continued to grow in strength and beauty.
The man who had built a pylon hide near the nest in order to photo-
graph the birds was puzzled because in several days of regular work in
his hide he had not had so much as a glimpse of the parent birds. He
badly wanted to see them because he was unable to identify the nestling,
and he felt that a good photograph of the adults would help to establish
the species. He himself was a keen photographer, but laid no claim to
ornithological knowledge.
At this time I w r as fortunate enough to enjoy the hospitality of the Queen
Victoria Museum and was living in a flat within the building. People
came to see me, and word got round of my interest in birds of prey and
falconry. Thus it transpired that a Mr. Nicholl of South Africa who was
taking a holiday in Rhodesia dropped in one day to tell me of a large nest
he had found and was trying to photograph.
" But ", he went on, " in about ten days of work in my pylon hide I
have not seen the adult birds at all! What do you make of it? "
Now it is a deplorable fact that birds of prey are regarded generally as
harmful by those who know little about them, and I had listened to many
sad tales of beautiful birds like a Honey Buzzard, who was shot at once
because " ... it was after our farm stock." A Honey Buzzard!--a bird
which eats wasps' grubs and scarcely ever kills anything bigger than a
mouse! (Incidentally this was only the second or third record of this
bird in Rhodesia.)
So, I concluded that whatever the species of Mr. Nicholl's birds, there
was a possibility of its being a case of " parents shot or trapped; youngster
starving in the nest."
I told my visitor that I would come out and collect the young bird as
soon as I could arrange transport. I was assured it would not be
easy as the tree was enormous and, in his opinion, unclimbable. But I had
heard this before about cliffs and trees and felt quite confident we could
get up without too much trouble.
A day or so later I managed to borrow a friend and his motor car to come
and help with the project. We travelled north a long way and through the
" bush " to a farm where the nest was. A walk of about half-a-mile

from the farmer's house brought us to the dried up stream which drained
from the thickly wooded hills above. Then we came out to a grassy
valley floor, and there across the stream-bed stood the tree. A mighty
tree it was too! At the base, which as I have said grew from the bank of
the stream, the thickness of the bole was about eight or nine feet and
smooth. The first branches were at about sixty-five feet from the
ground and there in the crutch of these great limbs was a cartload of
branches and sticks. Protruding over the edge was a grey and black tail,
all we could see of the occupant of this arboreal castle.
I had purchased a rope and a ball of string that morning, and the idea
was that I would tie the string to a stone and throw this over one of the
branches. Then the end of the rope could be attached to the other end
of the string and hauled over the branch to provide a means of climbing
up the tree. This was a splendid idea--and utterly useless! Because the
grass was so long the string would not run and the stone could not be
thrown over the branch! A conference followed, and it was decided to
try other methods, but before we evolved a satisfactory plan of assault on
the fortress, the eaglet, now thoroughly alarmed, decided to leave the
scene of her own accord. She spread her broad wings and sailed away
across the valley to pitch on the ground under a thorn bush. Fortunately
Mr. Nicholl had seen her leave and shouted the news. We were able to
mark the exact spot where she pitched and walk up cautiously to her
hiding place. She made no attempt to defend her virginity other than to
open her beak and gape at me as I slipped a hand underneath her wing
and took a firm hold upon her legs. (It is a rule you may ignore at your
peril, that when handling a bird of prey that is unused to human usage,
it is well to get hold of the legs, well above the ankles. Confined thus she
cannot do any serious harm to the handler, and, what is far more important ,
she cannot seriously damage herself!)
It is an interesting thing about this species that the young do not
apparently try to strike out at intruders as would a nest of Goshawks or
Golden Eagles at a similar age. I found exactly the same behaviour in
another young bird of the same species some months later at a different
eyrie. Neither made any attempt to defend itself, but both flew away
when first disturbed and hid in long grass on the ground.
So my sensible precautions against those formidable feet being un-
necessarv I wrapped her in a sack and conveyed her back to the farm-house.
There some temporary jesses w r ere fitted on her legs and w r e prepared for
the long drive back to Salisbury.
Tiara soon named herself by raising her beautiful crest on the slightest
pretext. I was given facilities to keep her in a small secluded yard where
she could hear all that went on in the Museum grounds but was free from
interference. I obtained an old broken bed on top of which I piled a
nest of sticks and green leaves. Here she would sleep lying down, for

although she was all but full-grown she had not developed the art of
roosting on a perch.
Normally with a young bird of prey one would not attempt to start any
training until all the feathers are fully grown and, as we say, " hard-
penned." But to my astonishment on the morning after her first night
she jumped to my fist without any of the normal inducements of proffered
food, and stood on the glove like a veteran trained hawk! Nothing like
this had ever happened to me before in many years of experience in
handling hawks and eagles both young and wild-caught. I had brought
her some meat in my satchel, intending to tie it down on the " nest " for
her to investigate at her leisure, but now I produced it from the bag and
offered it to her on my fist. She fed well and with no hestitation. I felt
her breast-bone to see if she was thin and therefore inordinately hungry;
but no, she was full of flesh and had obviously been very well fed by her
parents. Here I must say the idea of her parents having been shot or
otherwise having come to grief was dispelled as soon as I had seen Tiara
properly after her capture. These eagles are very secretive in their habits,
and when their offspring becomes capable of tearing up food for itself,
they do not spend over much time at the nest. They deliver the goods and
decamp although they may be in the vicinity most of the time. I had
seen them soaring at a height while we were engaged in the taking of the
eaglet. My friend Mr. Nicholl had undoubtedly been watched carefully
by the eagles while he was building his hide and they knew whether he
was there or not, and chose the times of his absence to swoop in to the
nest, drop a monkey and leave. This is the reason for his not having
seen them during his ten days in the hide.
So I now possessed a young Crowned Hawk-Eagle very nearly full
grown and showing the most amazing readiness to co-operate with me.
I gave her five weeks to complete the growth of her feathers, with as
much good food as she wanted to eat, and then her serious training was
begun. It must be understood that she was intended to be used for falconry.
She was not to be a pet or something to be produced at exhibitions or
shows; she was to be taught how to live the normal life as far as possible
of a wild eagle. The shows, television appearances, lectures, etc., have
come into her life inevitably, but she is today fully competent to be taken
out and released in the wilds where she would have to look to her own
needs and safety. She is a killer who knows her own ability, and I have
carefully tended her over the years to make certain of her good health, and
welfare.
The only disappointment I have suffered lies in the fact that Britain is
becoming increasingly difficult as a country in which to fly a large eagle
regularly at wild quarry. Her opportunities are all too few, and the day
may well come when I shall have to take her back home, cut her jesses off
and whistle her down the wind. There has to be an end of all good things
and I simply trust the end need not be yet.

By Owen D. Long (Salisbury, Rhodesia)
There are probably as many ideas and diets for feeding birds of prey
as there are species, and whilst I do not train birds for falconry, and have
no argument with the food used by those who do, an article in a recent
issue of a bird magazine about a Kestrel being fed on minced meat leads
me to think that it is time something was said on this subject.
I have not had a vast number of years experience of rearing raptors,
but during the last five or six years I have cared for some 40 or so of these
birds, ranging in size from a Secretary-Bird, down to a Little Banded
Goshawk. All of these birds have been found in need of attention, some
with broken wings or legs, and some that have had rough treatment of
one sort or another. Some died as a direct result of their injuries, but
none has done so from malnutrition (with the one exception mentioned
later).
At this moment I have a Wahlberg's Eagle which was reared on minced
meat from the time it was taken from its nest by a misguided schoolboy.
It was then, so the story goes, only four or five days old, and finally when
I was asked if I could do something about it, it was about three months
old, and I was presented with a bundle of feathers that looked as much
like a bird as an egg does.
On enquiring as to when it had last eaten, I was told that it had taken
no food for at least three days. This seemed most odd, for its crop was
full, but upon opening its beak, the stench that came out was frightful.
I managed to get a finger down its throat and pulled out two golf-ball
size masses of putrifying minced meat. At this age the bird could not
stand, and was disinclined to move at all, so it was put into an open box
and fed about six times a day on fresh ox heart. I was tempted to put
it out of its misery, but decided to experiment with vitamins and minerals,
etc., just to see what could be done.
In this part of the world we are fortunate in having an excellent source
of minerals and vitamins for animal consumption. VETEREX is a
multi-vitamin and trace element complex, suitable for all birds and animals.
I cannot speak for the animals, but as far as the birds are concerned,
it is for me, indispensable. I would at this point like to make the usual
comment that I have no connection with the manufacturers of this concen-
trate. I am sure that equally effective products are made elsewhere, but
for comparison I give the listed components that make this " muti
so efficient.
All my hawks, etc., are fed on raw ox-heart from which all traces of fat
have been removed. This, together with the Veterex keeps them in near
perfect condition, and I am sometimes fortunate enough to see those
that I have been able to release, after a period of several months, looking

none the worse for their enforced captivity. The Veterex is diluted with
water (about one part Veterex to ten/fifteen parts of water), and the
solution is injected into the meat.
Subjected to this somewhat monotonous diet, my Wahlberg started to
?ain weight and strength, and after a month it was able to shuffle around
its enclosure, but was obviously going to be permanently grounded with a
severe dose of rickets in one wing. However, she is now three years old,
md can easily jump on to her perch, and from there, in zero wind con-
ditions can manage to fly fifteen feet or so, but alas, always in a downward
direction.
Finding that ox heart made such an efficient foodstuff, I decided to
see what would happen when fed to other birds. I would point out here
hat I run, in a small way, a hospital for any bird that is found injured or
n need of attention, and in consequence I have the opportunity to
ixperiment with ox-heart on a variety of species. Needless to say, the
seed eaters are not included, but any bird which is known to include
' meat " in its diet, and which comes my way, is induced to try out
ix-heart. Indeed, one Hoopoe would eat nothing else, so much so that
when there was a temporary shortage of ox-heart a few months ago, I
:ould find nothing that it would eat, including its natural food, and I am
sorry to relate that it died of starvation. In this case, even forced feeding
mded in failure, for everything so fed was regurgitated in a matter of
minutes. Shrikes, Babblers, Bulbuls, and many others who are known
:o include meat in their diet have been successfully fed on ox-heart and
&apos;eleased when mended.
Gold, Silver and Ring-neck Pheasants also appear to flourish when fed
i little finely grated ox-heart, and since trying out this food, the proportion
)f fertile eggs has gone up, and in consequence more chicks have been
*eared. This might, of course, be partly due to the Veterex which is
ilso included with the meat. As a basic food for some meat eaters, I
relieve that only a natural diet can compete with ox-heart, and as an
idditional item for other birds, I am sure it has many advantages.
One other point that may be made here is that the only casting which
ny hawks get is in the form of grass that is eaten along with the meat.
Vo casting is given at all, neither fur nor feather. On this diet alone they
noult successfully, with no hunger traces in their feathers, and the only
ndication that I can see in any of my birds is that the cere and sometimes
he feet lose a little colour, and though this may indicate that they are not
exactly ioo%, they never complain.

BREEDING THE RED-BILLED HORNBILL

A pair of Red-billed Hornbills was imported from East Africa in th
spring of 1966. After being housed in a large glass-fronted plante
compartment for a few weeks they were transferred to the free flight are;
which they have shared since then with other hornbill species, toucan?
fruit pigeons and other large softbills. Nesting activity was first notice
towards the end of 1966, when attempts were made to plaster-up th
entrance holes of several of the larger nest-boxes provided for the toucar
and larger hornbills. As these attempts were unsuccessful they finall
selected a small plywood box about one foot square, which had a sing
small entrance hole near the top. This box was situated about fiftee
feet from the ground, just below the false roof of wire netting. The he
remained sealed inside this box for a total of seventeen weeks durir
which time the cock bird fed her untiringly. On this occasion the s

<bodyText confidence="0.999786222222222" page_id="58089148"  page_num="145" year="" vol="">
eggs proved to be clear. A most interesting feature was the use of
considerable amounts of nesting material such as palm fronds, leaves,
feathers, grass, etc., resulting in a well-formed nest inside the box, which
left a space of only 8 inches by 7 inches by four inches high for the hen.
The nest was completely free of droppings, but it was discovered that
another clutch of eggs had been laid nearer to the bottom of the nest-box
and had been well covered with nesting material before the second, incuba-
ted, clutch had been laid. It is likely, therefore, that the filling of the
nest-box with material to a depth far greater than would be necessary
for the hen to reach the hole with her bill is perhaps not normal practice.
On leaving the nest the hen bird was fully feathered and could fly
immediately.
Within several days of leaving the box attempts were again made to seal
the entrance holes of the larger toucan nest-boxes. They were again
unsuccessful and the birds eventually settled for a heavy wooden box
about two feet high by one foot square which had been suspended in
the apex of the roof, about twenty feet above floor level. Both birds
shared the task of sealing the entrance hole with the soil and peat mixture
which they gathered from the floor of the free flight. They were not
observed to use the clay which was provided for them. The material
removed from the box after their first attempt at nesting revealed that the
rock-hard dried mud contained numerous small pieces of grass and palm
fibre. Droppings were not observed to be used in the basic sealing of
the entrance hole to the stage where the hen could just squeeze in.
It was thought that egg-laying was completed prior to the hen being
sealed into the box for incubating the clutch, as for several days beforehand
she had entered the box for a short time daily. The final sealing of the
hole was completed by the hen from the inside, until a narrow slit
approximately two inches high by half an inch wide remained open. The
cock bird was again most conscientious, feeding the hen with the choicest
foods before he ate. The insectile and minced beef mixture used widely
in the Winged World and insects were favoured, fruit being fed very
sparingly. Droppings were ejected through the entrance hole.
From the strange behaviour of both the cock bird and the hen inside
the box, it was assumed that the eggs hatched thirty-four days after the
hen was sealed in. This was further confirmed by the increased demand
thereafter for live food.
The provision of ample live food was simplified due to the tameness of
the cock bird, and the attention of two members of the Winged World staff,
head-keeper Bryan Ward and Trevor Gibson. Several times daily the
cock hornbill flew down to a favourite perch to be hand-fed, and made
literally dozens of trips to the nest-box on each occasion. Locusts,
mealworms and crickets were fed in this manner, and the maggots provided
ad lib were not observed to be taken up to the nest in any quantity. After
several days the insectile and beef mixture was taken up also. The

normal method of feeding the hen was for the cock to insert the fooc
item just inside the entrance slit. Any rejected food was quickly pushec
out again.
The hen emerged after seventy-two days in the box, which was thirty
eight days after we believed the eggs had hatched. This time also sh&amp;lt;
was in perfect condition and could fly immediately. The enlarged hob
was quickly resealed from the outside by the parents, although the younj
were also observed to be assisting from inside the box. For six days botl
parent birds took food to the young, which chipped away the hardene(
mud and emerged on the seventh day. There were only two youngster
and these were fully feathered and resembled the parents in every respec
other than in bill size, as these were shorter than that of the adult hen
They could fly well immediately upon leaving the nest and flew directb
to a branch some yards away. They were not seen to feed themselves fo:
some days after leaving the nest, but by the time they were five weeks ol(
they were completely independent of the parent birds.
The hen entered the nest-box again approximately six weeks after th&amp;lt;
young had left it, and has been sealed in since that time--a period o
seventy-two days. From the noises emanating from the box it seem:
likely that there are at least four young on this occasion.
It is interesting to note that from the time the hen entered the nest-bo^
to incubate her first clutch of eggs until the present day, she has been ii
" solitary " for a period of two hundred and sixty-three days out of a tota
of three hundred and ninety-three. During this time the only fluid:
she received were derived from the moisture content of her solid foot

Judging from the number of inquiries I receive from domestic pigeoi
keepers, there is a keen demand for a green domestic breed, either all-greei
or partially green. These men have seen the lovely green fruit pigeon
in zoos and in fanciers' aviaries, and also the Indian Greenwing Dove
so frequently kept nowadays. However, they do not realize the practicall;
insurmountable difficulties in producing such a hybrid. Not knowinj
the character and the habits of the Indian Greenwing or the variou
Green Fruit Pigeons, they very naively jump to the conclusion that sine
these foreigners are also called pigeons, they must of necessity " be willinj
and able " to cross with suitable domestic varieties. The main troubl
with these so-called fanciers is that they make no attempt to obtain factua
and authentic information explaining the real nature and behaviour 0
wild doves and pigeons, whether seed eaters or fruit eaters. Some 0

them are convinced that there is a fortune in producing a green or partially
green domestic pigeon, one that will prove fertile! I have endeavoured
to explain to them, as best I could, the unbridgeable difficulties attending
the mating of Indian Greenwings or Green Fruit Pigeons with domestic
breeders, but to little avail.
Now come inquiries demanding to know if by means of insemination
fertile hybrids between green wild doves and domestic pigeons can be
produced; and if so, what the exact procedures leading to possible success
should be. I do not know of any experiments undertaken in this field,
and would thank any member of the Society who knows of such successful
information to let the Editor, or me, know the details. Personally, I
very much doubt the feasibility of such experiments; however, we hear
at times of " queer " hybrids having been produced, and if such a hybrid
happens at this time to be " in hiding " in some zoo or private aviary,

In March, 1968, three European Eagle-Owls hatched and were
successfully reared by the well-experienced breeding pair which we are
keeping since many years in our Zoo. Several of the young bred here
were given to the German Society for Protection of Nature which is trying
to re-introduce the Eagle-Owl in some parts of Bavaria. So far, these
experiences have been very successful, and the authorities interested in
this matter are preparing to release Eagle-Owls also in other parts of
Germany.
A remarkable addition to our collection of Ostriches, consisting of
Rheas, Emus, One-Wattled and Helmeted Cassowaries, and African
Ostriches were three fine specimens of the rare Darwin's Rhea (Pterocnetnia
pennata ), hatched in captivity. This species which was kept in our Zoo
already in pre-war times is slightly smaller than their common relative,
its plumage is light brown spotted with white and its head appears to be
more " childish " that that of the Rhea.
So far, breeding activity in our Pelican group started only in summer
when the birds had left their winter quarters and were released on a pond.
This year, however, they began laying their eggs already at the end of
January in a part of the Antelope House where they had been spending
the cold months. Unfortunately, most of the eggs broke--due to fighting
of the birds, and one egg of the White Pelican put into an incubator proved
to contain an embryo which died a few days before hatching.

During the past few months many choice specimens have been added
to the collection, the most impressive being the group of eleven Blue-
collared Bee-eaters which were obtained from Mr. Guy Detry of Wavre,
Belgium. Several of these birds had been in his collection for a con-
siderable time and they quickly settled down at the Winged World.
Three species of Cotinga--the Scaly-breasted, Cherry-throated and
Orange-breasted, and the rarely seen White-headed Touraco have been
purchased.
Other species which have been acquired are pairs of Goulds Heavenly
Sylph Hummingbirds, Rufous-bellied Bulbuls, Red-headed Thrushes and
Lesser Green Broadbills; and a Whiskered Tanager, Moss-backed Tanager
and Streaked Spiderhunter. A small consignment of birds imported
from East Africa contained an immature cock Purple-throated Cuckoo
Shrike, and pairs of Temminck's Coursers, Gold-rumped Tinker Barbets
and Blacksmith Plovers.
Breeding has now commenced in earnest, and although the final
results so far have not been too successful they are still encouraging and
herald a promising future. Community aviaries do not of course provide
the most suitable conditions for breeding birds due to territorial disputes
and the need to frequently move birds to obtain compatible groups.
Also, many species have definite aggressive tendencies towards nestlings,
should breeding have reached that stage; and the provision of sufficient
live food when there is so much competition for it is always a problem.
In view of these problems we do not expect to achieve fantastic breeding
results.
The list of species which have commenced breeding, but have been
thwarted, already contains some interesting names however, particularly
as the Winged World was completed only two years ago. Needless to
say, in instances where the cause of the loss of young or eggs was known
remedial action has been taken. In the past twelve months pairs of White-
capped Redstarts and Black-spotted Barbets have each hatched two
clutches but failed to rear them. Southern Tree-Pies and Thailand
Hoopoes became egg-bound after laying two eggs each, but the Hoopoes
are sitting again. Roulrouls and Sun Bitterns lost their eggs to marauders,
but the Roulrouls have since produced more eggs which have been removed
for incubation. Violet Euphonias and Rothschild's Grackles have also
had two clutches but failed to rear them, and a Brown-throated Barbet
became ill with an eye infection whilst incubating five eggs.
On the credit side we have bred the Red-billed Hornbill and have a
second clutch almost ready to leave the nest, and the Green Wood-Hoopoes
have reared four young. Yellow-breasted Fruit Pigeons and the Andaman
Grackles are incubating eggs and the Sulphur-breasted Toucans are
showing great interest in a nest-box.

A Magellan Eagle-Owl, Bubo virginianus nacurutu , has been bred
in the Gardens, the parents being a bird received in 1948 and one collected
by Mr. David Attenborough on the B.B.C.'s Zoo Quest to Paraguay during
1958. This appears to be the first breeding in the British Isles of the
most southerly race of B. virginianus&apos;. in 1928 the northern B. v. virginianus ,
the Great Horned or Virginian Eagle-Owl was bred at Wargrave and the
Medal was awarded for this first success. Other owls bred are three
Kenya and one Spotted Eagle-Owls, and two Barn Owls. Great Eagle-
Owls, after one infertile clutch, now have young and a West African
Wood-Owl is incubating eggs.
Cormorants have bred again after four barren years and appear to have
two chicks. A pair of Rooks nested and hatched three chicks which
survived for only two or three days. Pigmy Falcons have nested yet
again, but so far as is known none of the eggs hatched. The Princess
Stephanie's Bird of Paradise which hatched two young ones last summer is
now incubating an egg after two failures, the egg in each case being broken.
There has been nest-building in Rufous, White-throated and Necklaced
Laughing-Thrushes, but nothing further so far.
A Spotted Morning Warbler, Cichladusa guttata , presented by G. H.
and J. R. Newmark represents a genus new to the collection. The
Morning Warblers are so named from their habit of being among the
earliest as well as the finest of the African songsters. C. guttata is said
to mimic the calls and songs of other birds and to sing for much of the
day and even at night. It is often about houses, becoming quite tame and
sometimes building its nest, mostly composed of mud, on rafters and
ledges of buildings.
A new subspecies is a Malayan Black-crested Bulbul, Pycnonotus
melanicterus caecilii y presented together with a pair of Javan Fruitsuckers,
Chloropsis sonnerati and a Formosan Blue Pie, Urocissa caerulea , by Dr.
K. C. Searle. A Long-tailed or Streamer-tailed Humming Bird (female)
has been presented by Mr. L. W. Hill and this makes a pair from which
hopes of breeding are entertained, for it is this species that first bred at the
Cleveland Zoo and later was so nearly successful in rearing a chick at
Capt. R. S. de Quincey's collection.
A Yellow-backed Lory, a Kingfisher, two Black-crowned Waxbills,
Estrilda n. nonnula , a Collared, two Violet-backed and a Beautiful Sunbird
are other arrivals of particular interest.

The Pygmy Parrots of the genus Micropsitta (olim Nasiterna) are
regarded as being the smallest parrots in the world. But which of the
six species and 13 subspecies listed by Peters is actually the smallest?
Salvadori, The Catalogue of Birds in the British Museum , vol. XX, gives
the measurements of nine species. The total length ranges from 3-1 in.
{pygmaea ) to 4*3 in. ( finschi ). Canon H. B. Tristram (Ibis, 1891, p. 608)
gives the total length of a single female nanina as 2-8 in. Unless this is a
quite exceptional specimen it would appear to be the smallest member of
this diminutive genus. It is hoped that members having access to
museum specimens will examine them and make known the results.

In the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland Annual Report , 1967, p. 19,
there is a very interesting note: " Some years ago a consignment of Gentoo
Penguins bred in Edinburgh was sent to St. Louis Zoological Park, Missouri,
U.S.A., and the following account of a most unusual mating has been
received from its Zoological Board of Control. One of the Edinburgh
Gentoos proved to be a female, and in 1964 this bird mated with a male
Adelie Penguin, though the single egg was infertile. The same pair of
birds mated again in 1966, when two eggs were laid, one of which was
infertile; but the other, laid on 20th April, hatched on 25th May and the
chick was successfully reared, an interesting and no doubt unique record
of a cross between the more northerly Gentoo Penguin and the Adelie of
the true Polar regions ".

In 1957 the Council authorized a car badge. Sales were apparently
quite good but the Society derived little benefit. The Member in charge
of sales stole silently away, taking with him the proceeds and stock. The
Society had the very doubtful pleasure of paying for the production, and
some Members never received the badges for which they had paid.
With this in mind one is perhaps a little chary of a second attempt.
Some replies to the recent Questionnaire do, however, tend to show that
there is a demand for a badge.
Design-minded Members are therefore asked to submit suggestions to
be laid before the Council in due course.
An interesting sidelight is shown in a recent note from Kumar Shri
Dharmakumarsinhji of Bhavnagar. He writes: " I have now lost two of
the Society's car badges, both being stolen by removal from amongst other
car badges which were untouched. This shows how popular and
impressive the Society's badges must be in this part of India. I doubt
whether the Bird of Paradise is recognised as such, but obviously the
design and colour of the badge are attractive ".

During the many years in which I maintained an extensive collection
of birds I never succeeded in breeding a Gouldian. This very attractive
finch, whether black-, red-, or yellow-headed is somewhat unpredictable
in its nesting behaviour. Many (or rather most, in my experience) never
show any sign of wishing to breed, but when they do start they are
seemingly often quite prolific.
In Great Britain the first to record success was Reginald Phillipps,
three young reared by a pair of red-headed, in 1891. Since then there
have, of course, been many records, but the majority are of just a few
in number. But Bernard Thomasset had 17 fully reared by a single pair
in 1915; the same hen had brought up 13 in the previous year. In more
recent years Herbert Whitley at Paignton and P. W. Teague in Hereford
bred them freely--the first in large and perfect aviaries, the latter under
less ideal conditions. Ralph Frayne succeeded in establishing a strain of
home-bred birds. It was his aim eventually to breed 100 in a year.
Whether he succeeded I do not know, but in 1935 he reported that he had
45 youngsters flying, with the expectation of more. Gouldians have been
regularly bred at Keston and Edward Boosey once reported that a
spectacular brood of nine young in a single nest had all been successfully
reared.

hatched, two thrown out of the nest and mutilated, one fully fledged
young cock abandoned. Hand-feeding was tried but it was too far gone
and died next day. A second pair, four eggs, two hatched, died after a
few days. Lesser Niltava Niltava macgrigoriae, three eggs, three hatched.
All three very fine chicks were gently deposited at the far end of the
flight on 8th May. Considerable difficulty was experienced in providing
sufficient small, live food, and they died just before two large jars of moth
larvae were obtained. Golden Bush Robin Erithacus chrysaeus, two eggs,
one of which was soft-shelled. The young one was very small and in a

It was, however, reared to be independent of its parents, but died a few
days later. Red-flanked Bush Robin Erithacus cyanurus, from the
egg-shells in the flight it appears that one or two young were hatched
about 10th June.

Visitors to Foxwarren Park during 1925-1938 were greatly privileged,
had they but known it, to see some of the last survivors of what is now
generally believed to be an extinct species--the Indian Pink-headed Duck
Rhodonessa caryophyllacea.
Our late President Mr. Alfred Ezra, through the good offices of his
brother Sir David Ezra, of Calcutta, received five living specimens, three
drakes and two ducks, in July, 1925. One drake died as the result of an
accident and another, a month after arrival, of some affection of the eye.
In 1929 ten more ducks arrived, most of which were retained at Foxwarren
Park. By 1938 there was but a sole survivor. In 1941 Mr. Ezra recorded:
" At one time I had as many as ten of these birds, and some of them lived
over ten years" (Avicultural Magazine, 1941, p. 141). There was a
pair at Cleres in 1925, and a further two pairs reached there in 1929.
This duck has not been reliably reported in the wild since 1935, apart
from a correspondent in the August, 1966, number of the Journal of
the Bombay Natural History Society , who claims to have shot one of a
flock of six on 27th January, 1947, in Bihar; and to have seen five to eight
of them in 1948-49 on Lake Manroopa. An extensive two-year search
has just been concluded in Burma. No trace of this duck was found and
it must be regarded as definitely extinct there.

the cover of bushes and undergrowth. " Fred's " appetite is prodigious
and truly omnivorous, nothing comes amiss--whether it be small seeds in
the dove and pheasant mixture, fragments of poultry layer pellets, soaked
hound meal, even tinned dog food--just about anything. It is generally
recognised that many birds are highly imitative in their feeding habits and
will soon learn to take unfamiliar foods if they see other birds doing so
first. With " Fred " as a guide the feeding-habits of the whole area could
be changed considerably! What, we wonder, will happen if in due

by a whole bevy of " Freds " and " Fredas ", all vying with each other as
scolds and " bossy-boots "? But, as yet, there is no indication of " Fred "
even considering taking on domestic duties--rather for him the life of an
avian sybarite. We have long since grown used to his scoldings and will
sadly miss him if, and when, he leaves us, even if only temporarily.

DUCKS, GEESE and SWANS. By John Welman. Instructions to
Young Ornithologists. VII. London: Museum Press, 1968. Price
205 .
On 124 pages, illustrated with schematic line drawings and 16 excellent
photographs, Mr. Welman, who writes well and wittily, has condensed
most of our present knowledge of the birds of the family Anatidae. All
species are mentioned, concisely described and the distribution is given.
It is all accurate, following the modern taxonomy and nomenclature
generally accepted today, and very suitable for young students of birds.
The author is a field naturalist and has observed waterfowl in Europe
and in Africa. He therefore has personal experience and ideas of his
own, which make interesting reading, particularly in the chapters on
general matters, especially on migrations and on " ways of life " to be
found in the middle of the book, between two descriptive parts, the first
of European species, the second of those of the rest of the world.
The first two chapters are devoted to generalities (" In Explanation ")
and family characters (" Birds of Distinction ").
Mr. Welman believes that waterfowl possess a sense of direction, not
yet known, to assist them in their flights to and from the breeding grounds,
and he is sceptical about the influence of the sun and stars on their travels.
He also thinks that birds in confinement, do not show completely their
behavioural peculiarities; he is therefore not in favour of captive collec-
tions. With such an opinion I happen to disagree as the greatest part of

our knowledge of the comportment of the Anatidae has been gained from
the observation of captive birds as proved by the classic studies of Konrad
Lorenz and others. In his great love for the ducks Mr. Welman has,
I am afraid, slight delusions in their goodness and their life habits!
There are very few mistakes in this excellent book. The only one I must
mention is on pp. 102-103, where the texts relating to the African Black
Duck and the African Yellowbill have been transposed. Altogether a
very good book for beginners. J. D.

AVIARY BIRDS. By Rosemary Low. London: Arco Publications,
1968. Price 36s.
This book seems intended as a fairly comprehensive guide to bird-
keeping for the beginner and it seems to me to be a good one. No book
dealing with so many different species can deal with them all in full detail,
but if anyone has bought a pair of birds on the impulse has also bought
this book, and consults it quickly, they will be more likely to thrive than
die. Although the title might not suggest it there is also considerable
emphasis and information on showing.
In her preface the author rightly stresses the desirability of building up
breeding stocks of both British and foreign species in captivity, although,
in my opinion, she overestimates both the threats to such of our native
species as can be bred readily in captivity and the abilities of aviculturists
to perpetuate them should they become rare or extinct in the wild. This
is followed by chapters on Feeding; Care and Treatment of Sick Birds;
British Birds; Foreign Seed-eaters; Foreign Soft-bills; Budgerigars;
Canaries; Bengalese and Zebra Finches; Mixed Collections and Ground
Species; and Exhibiting.
Under each of the " bird " headings listed above a general introduction
is followed by a list of species, each of which is individually described and
advice on its care given. It is clear that all possible species could not be
included in a book of this size and some people, particularly lovers of
foreign cardueline finches, may be disappointed at not finding many of
their favourites. I thought, however, that the author had made excellent
choice of a large number of better-known, more easily obtained and/or
more attractive species.
There are a few errors, the Red-eared Waxbill is not, for example,
" distributed widely over the African continent ", but most of those I
discovered are not of a kind likely to affect the book's value to the bird-
keeper. I would, however, take issue with the suggestion on page 68 that
its degree of tameness is the factor which decides whether a bird of the
crow kind (or any other kind for that matter) can safely be allowed to fly
at liberty. Other things being equal, absolutely tame birds are not more
likely to return than others that are not so tame; if anything they are more

likely to come to grief at human hands or make themselves a nuisance by
attacking people who annoy them! In a few points the author disagrees
with others, as when she recommends giving niger only in small quantities
to Goldfinches, whereas Nicolai, in his works on bird-keeping, is emphatic
that this species, and foreign cardueline finches with similar feeding
habits such as the Hooded Siskin, should be given niger ad lib.
The author's love of birds and willingness to take trouble with them
is very apparent. Indeed although (albeit in entire ignorance of medi-
cine) I feel doubtful of some of her recommended remedies; were I
stricken down, I should feel much happier being fed with syrup of buck-
thorn and painted with tincture of iodine (weak, of course) by her tender
hands than I should in some modern hospital with all the Marvels of

I read C. J. O. Harrison's notes on interspecific allopreening with interest. An
aspect I find puzzling is if Excalfactoria chinensis is the optimum size, why hens,
or at least the single hens I've kept with estrildines as " test cases ", arouse no
response as cocks seem to do? If this aspect is considered, it would seem a
possibility that optimum size plus plumage pattern (which to me did not seem valid)
could be the answer to this interaction.

'STIMULITE' NECTAR FOOD is a COMPLETE NUTRI-
TIONAL food in highly concentrated form. It is highly
beneficial to all livestock, whether it be Humming Birds,
Sun Birds or other Nectarines, Insectivorous Birds, Fruit-
eaters, Canaries, Finches, Parrakeets, Parrots, or any kind
of animal. This supreme food should be available to
them at all times.
Recently there has been some advocacy of a sugar and protein diet for
Humming Birds, such a diet is very deficient in nutritional value.
PROTEIN is produced within the body by METABOLISM from the
nutrients in the food consumed. A diet, to be fully nutritional, has to
contain all the essential vitamins, A, D, E, C, and the full vitamin B
Complex, Bl, B2, B6, B12 (known as the animal-protein factor), the full
context contains Thiamin, Riboflavine, Nicotinic Acid, Pantothenic Acid,
Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Inositol, Choline and Biotin. Only a food
containing all of these can be termed COMPLETE.
Metabolism can only convert the food into protein if the food also
contains the following amino acids : Arginine, Histidine, Lysine,
Trypotophane, Phenylalanine, Methionine, Leucine, Isoleucine and
Valine. All these factors are necessary for a fully nutritional food, they
are not heresay, but SCIENTIFIC FACTS which can be verified.

(Serinus pusillus)
By Zdenek Veger (Zoological Garden, Prague, Czechoslovakia)
Lately, I have read several inquiries about this exceptionally lovely
bird, which has not been seen on the market for many years. There are
plenty of breeders who would like to have it and others who would like to
try to cross it with canaries in order to produce some of its wonderful
colours in a new hybrid. The Golden-fronted Finch is a relative of the
canary--which promises good fertility for cross-breeding. These
ambitious plans, of course, have to overcome many obstacles about which
I will inform the reader as I very often try to keep this bird myself.
First of all, general information. This bird is quite plentiful in the
mountain areas of the Caucasus and Central Asia (Turkmenia, Tadschiki-
stan, Kazachstan), in the mountain regions of Asia Minor, Iran, Afghani-
stan, Kashmir and Tibet.
Compared to all other species of Serins, it is unusually coloured. The
head, throat, breast and back part of the throat are black and on the crown
a brilliant red " cap ". The back is cinnamon with black stripes, the
rump orange, belly grey-yellow with dark patches on the flanks. Wing
and tail feathers are black-brown, edged with yellow. The beak and legs
are black.
The female has a reddish eyebrow and the rump is of an orange shade.
The rest of the plumage is rather dull. Up to one year of age its brow is
not red. On closer inspection we see the differences of an adult female
and a young male as not too striking. The young are cinnamon-headed.
The length of the male is about 128 mm., the female 125 mm.; the
wing of the male 74*6 mm., the female 71-4 mm.; and the tail is about
58-60 mm.
Mrs. Lukina of Leningrad described minutely the life-habits of these
birds. The Golden-fronted Finch mostly inhabits the middle range of
mountain regions, from where in winter it descends to the lower hill
areas of milder climate, with better prospects of finding food. Here the
birds live in flocks of about 20-30 individuals, sometimes in mixed
societies of Redpolls, Linnets and Goldfinches, of 200-300 birds, till
the onset of spring. As soon as the thaw on the south slopes sets in the
Golden-fronted Finches return to higher regions. Here they live in areas
with alternating thin birch and pine forests and mountain pastures grown

with rhododendrons. In May the pairs begin to nest close to one another.
The males, according to Beme, sing all day long, sitting on the top of a
hill, a birch or a boulder exactly as our Serins do, with their wings
drooping, turning in all directions.
Caban in Kazachstan used to observe these birds nesting, even in dense
forest growth as high as 2,000 m. above sea-level, on the ends of the pine
branches half-way up the tree, about 12-15 m. above ground. Many oi
these birds ascend in the summer period above the upper range of the
forest, to 2,700-2,800 m. above sea-level, where they build their nests in
rock fissures or in dwarf pine bushes.
The tiny neat nest is made of grass, moss, thin roots and hairs. There
are 4-5 blue-white, cinnamon-speckled eggs, hatched by the female only,
the young being fed by both the parents. They nest twice a year and
then gather up again in flocks. Their food is mostly seeds of mountain
grass, birch trees and alders. While feeding the young they pick up small
insects.
The Golden-fronted Finch as it is, very easily gets accustomed to new
surroundings in the cage as well as to substitute food. Their behaviour
may be looked upon as identical with that of Serins. When fed on
birch seed, lettuce seed, poppy, niger, germed seeds, vegetables and fresh
ant pupae, they appear quite comfortable--but not for long.

I kept quite a number of Golden-fronted Finches in full health and singing
for more than a year, but up to now have not succeeded in keeping them any
longer. According to Lukina, the Golden-fronted Finches caught in the first
winter months died in spite of all care, mostly in March or April the next
year, due to absence of vitamin Bi. When administering 1% solution of
thiamin twice a week the symptoms of avitaminose decreased, but the
birds suffered from intestinal upsets.
I am sure that the cause of these failures is insufficient knowledge of
biology, mostly of the food regime of these birds in the wild. The fact
that most birds die in spring (that is, in the period when they go back to
high mountain regions) seems to indicate that they lack the mountain
climate or some of the food components therefrom. I think, however,
that the expert breeder will suceed in overcoming these difficulties.
Then at last, perhaps, we shall be able to enjoy the keeping of this lovely
bird of charming disposition in captivity.

HAND-REARING THE THAILAND HOOPOE
(Upupa epops longirostris )
By Wes Benson (Curator of Education, Consulting Bird Curator,
Oklahoma City Zoo, U.S.A.)

<bodyText confidence="0.969031333333333" page_id="58089176"  page_num="159" year="" vol="">
As with most insectivorous birds, the hoopoe of South-east Asia
(Upupa epops longirostris*) has presented many problems for both pro-
fessional and amateur aviculturists. Wild-caught adult birds are almost
impossible to get over to a captive diet of any type. Thus, the taking
and hand-rearing of nestlings seems to be the only real answer for success.
Taking nestlings from the parents can be justified provided it is done on
a very small scale and the process used for rearing the chicks is proven to
be at least 90% successful. It can only be considered as a crime by
ornithologists and naturalists if nestlings are continuously taken and rearing
is unsuccessful. Zoos and private collectors must constantly be aware of
their responsibilities to the broad conservation of all species. Robbing
nests for one's personal pleasure and not properly rearing the birds is a
practice frequently maligned by many naturalists--and justifiably so.
Several U.S. and European zoos had requested me to collect and accli-
mate hoopoes for them while I was collecting animals in southern Thailand
near Songkhla. Since the purpose of the zoos was to make an effort to
breed these beautiful birds in captivity, the conservation possibilities
seemed to be worth the risk of removing a few chicks from the wild

An interpreter and I collected 23 chicks from holes in the banks of two
small rivers near our camp. The chicks were approximately one and a
half to two weeks of age and had begun to develop primaries. They
were immediately placed in a box measuring 2 ft. square and 18 in. high.
Loose fabric was placed in the box for the birds; this could be removed
two or three times a day to facilitate cleaning. A thin (cheesecloth-like)
material was placed over the box to keep it reasonably dark.
The box containing the chicks was placed in a draught-free room that was
not excessively hot. Feeding was done every three hours for the first 10
days and then every five hours for the next two weeks, after which the
chicks w 7 ere fed three times a day until they had reached two months of
age. After two months they were fed twice a day until full weaning.
The following diet was given each feeding until the hatchlings stopped
gaping:
fresh, raw ground beef or goat meat;
calcium powder (Tri-basic Calcium Merck was used), 1 tsp./lb.
meat;
cod liver oil or suitable source of vitamin D, 4 drps./lb. meat;
ground, hard-boiled egg (including shell), 1 egg/lb. meat.
Enough water was added to make the mixture the consistency of a very
thick soup. The water was eliminated after the first two weeks when the
birds were capable of drinking water in small but adequate amounts.
They were weaned to a high-protein, insectivore diet by using a few
live maggots on top of the food. Mealworms are not available in South-
east Asia, and cultures brought in do not seem to survive. Cleaned
maggots, however, were found to do quite well.
Birds reared in this fashion are now on exhibit at over 15 U.S. zoos, and
five exhibits have successfully reproduced in captivity.
For adult hoopoes, a dirt, sand, or peat floor covering has been found
best. Hoopoes apparently do not do very well on concrete or hard
surfaces. Hand-reared specimens follow the normal pattern of taking
dirt baths and continually prodding in the earth. This is to be encouraged,
and the introduction of a small number of mealworms in the dirt on the
floor will keep them prodding.
Out of a total of 78 nestlings collected, 74 survived to adulthood, and
several have now reached the age of five years in captivity. Nesting has
been observed in the second and third years of captive specimens, and one
pair nested four consecutive years, starting with their second summer.
Much of the work of hand-rearing the nestlings was accomplished by
an elderly Chinese woman who also aided me in hand-rearing three
species of kingfishers: Pelargopsis amauroptera , Halcyon smyrnensis fusca
and Halcyon chloris humil. Her home, which was on low stilts, was full
of boxes brimming with fledglings of various species. Her work, although
inglorious, has been a great aid to many zoos.

THE CHINESE CRESTED MYNAH
(Acridotheres cristatellus)
By Robin L. Restall (Copenhagen, Denmark)
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.984323846153846" page_id="58089178"  page_num="161" year="" vol="">
Earlier this year I had the opportunity of taking charge of a pair of
Chinese Crested Mynahs. Mr. Yealland kindly offered them to me in
exchange for some birds I had given to him, but in view of my planned
move to Denmark they were accepted strictly as a loan. Although I had
hoped to make some useful behavioural notes, in fact the demands on my
time over the few intervening months between the birds' arrival and my
departure were so many and from so many quarters that, in fact, my
ambition was not realized. However, I collected the following notes,
which were written while I still had the birds, and I hope are of interest
to members.
The Mynahs turned out to be an excellent pair, in sound condition and
full of bounce. Their travelling cage was put in the back of the car
where my two children could watch from the back seat. By the time I
had arrived home I had a fair idea of their vocabulary, for they chattered
away regularly and cheerfully. The best way to describe their noise is to
say that they sounded exactly like a cage full of Budgerigars with a pair of
Cockatiels added! Over the last couple of months it has become clear
that they were being considerate for my ear drums, and have since demon-
strated that they are capable of calling quite loudly. Their song has
developed somewhat too, although they are not as musical as the Spreo
Starling with whom they share their quarters.
Description
Although they are currently placed in the same genus as the Common
Mynah {Acridotheres tristis) they do seem to be very similar to the Hill
Mynahs in many ways, most strongly visually, being black all over with
white wing patches. They are quite large too, about the size of Jackdaws.
They are placed in the genus Aethiospar by early writers, the difference
being that Acridotheres had bare skin on their faces while Aethiospar were
fully feathered or tufted, but the two genera are now regarded as
synonymous.
The sexes appear to be more or less identical, and if my two are a pair
then I cannot yet discern any visual difference. The eyes are orange,
the bill is pale yellow, and the legs are a dull dark yellow. The feathers
of the crown, nape and sides of the head are narrow and lanceolate, but
they are not noticeably long as in the case of several allied species. The
feathers of the forehead and forecrown are twisted and brought forward
into a parody of a crest which my sketch shows much more clearly than
words can do. In fact, a better name for the species would be Tufted
Mynah, especially as some species have much better developed true

Underneath, the bird is a dark grey-black, virtually pure black, anc
there is a little dull white tipping to the undertail coverts. The tai
feathers are tipped with white, except the central pair. Immature birds
are duller and browner than adults, and the crest is less well developed
On the ground the bird looks just like a dull black Mynah, devoid o:
wattles or other points of interest--although the crest does give an interest*
ing profile to the head--and in the wild I imagine it would be very eas}
to pass it by in favour of almost any other species. However, when i
flies the white wing patch becomes very noticeable, and the bird is quit(
striking. When flying directly at the observer, they are reminiscent of s
black Mosquito plane, with white propellers, and from almost any angk
remind me of a black Spitfire with white roundels.
Distribution and Races
The Chinese Crested Mynah is a bird of southern China, ranging fron
southern Yunnan to the Yangtse. It is also found in eastern Burma
Luzon (from escapes or introduction), and it has been introduced intc
Vancouver. In a conversation with Mr. Herbert Murray recently hi
mentioned that he was familiar with the species, having seen some example:
from Formosa some years ago. This is a sub-species in fact ( A . c
formosanus ), which is distinguished by having a more developed crest

R. L. RESTALL--THE CHINESE CRESTED MYNAH 1 63
It would probably be listed as the Formosan Crested Mynah (after-
thought: wouldn't Taiwan be the correct nomenclature now?). A third
race, called the Little Crested Mynah by some (they must be looking
through the wrong end of the binoculars), is found in Hainan and is
known as A. c. brevipennis. It has a smaller and more slender bill, and
a shorter wing. It is not significantly smaller in body size. As far as I
can make out, the behaviour of the three races is the same.
Those readers who may have some of the pre-war bird literature on
China may find reference to A. c. grandis which is very similar, but is
separated as an independent species by modern systematists; Peters'
Checklist (Vol. XV, 1962) shows it as such. I will deal with this bird at
the end of the article.
Habitat and Habits
According to La Touche (1925)? who studied them in the wild, and who
kept many examples as pets, the Crested Mynah is the characteristic
bird of the cultivated plains and lowlands of southern China. It is as
familiar a bird on the ploughed fields and tilled soil as Rooks and Black-
headed Gulls are in Britain, following the ploughman to devour leather-
jackets, etc. When the plains and plateaux are being ploughed these
Mynahs gather in considerable numbers to take the spoils of the land.
They are also devotees of the pasture land, when they will walk about in
the long grass around the cattle and grab any insect that may be disturbed
by the movements of the animals. They can frequently be seen perching
on the backs of the cattle, from which vantage point, no doubt, they can
get a better view of the field. It has been suggested that they may also
take ticks and other parasites from the backs of the animals, but I am sure
that any symbiosis that may exist is more of a fortuitous one, where the
mynahs share the same grazing ground, rather than a proper one of the
same kind of relationship that Oxpeckers have with herbivores.
Just now I likened A. cristatellus to the British Rook in its attachment
to the farmer; well it does, in fact, consort with Rooks and Jackdaws,
and also Starlings. At dusk fall, especially during the autumn and winter
months, it roosts with these birds. One can easily imagine an oriental
starling roost, with scores of these noisy birds crowding the upper reaches
of a large stand of bamboo, and sprinkled throughout would be the much
larger Crested Mynah adding its own cries and warbles to the chorus.
The thought of a Chinese Rookery, with the same admixture, seems
equally exotic.
Friendly as the Crested Mynah is to the ploughman, and even though
he can frequently be seen walking around villages and back doorsteps,
he is a wary and shy bird. If this seems anomalous, one has only to think
of the House Sparrow which is at once tame and shy. However, if
taken from the nest and hand-reared, it can become very tame and com-
panionable. It is a favourite cage bird in China, and the Chinese take

large numbers every season to be hand-reared and kept as pets. La
Touche, who kept many, said that they become docile and easy to teach,
and also become good talkers. Some writers have suggested that learning
to speak Chinese is a dubious quality, and I am sure that if the owner
were a non-Chinese speaking person he might regard it as being of
academic value only. I expect a young bird could easily master European
sounds.
Local Names
One local name for the bird is " Dollar wing ", deriving from the
outstanding wing spots, but the Chinese call them " Pako ". This
means " Eight brethren ", as they are said to fly in flocks of eight. These
are probably family groups.
Food
Like so many Starlings, the Crested Mynah is more or less omnivorous.
In the fields it devours worms, beetles, slugs, grubs, etc., and is no doubt
an extremely beneficial species, and it refrains from attacking the crops.
In the gardens, however, it is thought to take some fruit and vegetables.
Its diet is no doubt seasonal. The Caldwells concluded that in their
opinion it was a beneficial species to man. The Chinese bird fanciers
rear their young Crested Mynahs on bean curd (Ton-fu), but La Touche
was of the opinion that the best diet was bread and milk plus minced raw
meat.
When I received my pair, they were being fed on the Society's own
home-made softbill mixture together with chopped fruit and minced raw
meat. I have offered a variety of fruits, mostly in separate bowls, but
increasingly mixed in with the soft food. In order--roughly--of pre-
ference the fruits go: grapes, pear, sultanas, raisins, apple, banana,
orange and currants. The dried fruit is soaked for a while beforehand,
and it is interesting that, while the big juicy sultanas go quickly (California
Seedless Raisins are a real treat), so the currants are left until last. Soft
food is supplied in the joint form of Sluis Mynah Food, to which I some-
times add raisins to soak up any excess moisture, and one of the " Uni-
versal " grades of soft food. Both of the main brands tend to dry out
fairly quickly, especially if one buys in economic quantities, and I
moisturize this by mixing it with a little water in which some honey has
been dissolved. Sluis Universal mixed with minced beef and pre-soaked
raisins is positively devoured.
Mealworms are given daily, and a handful is placed in a bowl on the
feeding shelf. At least a handful is also scattered around the aviary,
both in the sawdust in the house where the quail scratch for them, and in
drifts of dead leaves among the shrubs. The birds are all forced to hunt
for their favourite food, and so one of their basic drives--that of seeking
food--is gratified. I believe that this is an essential consideration when

keeping wild birds, and certainly my birds seem to be very happy with
their current lot. They spend more time food-seeking and less time
getting on each other's nerves, pecking at growing shoots, etc. I regularly
turn the compost heap and take up a few dozen healthy red worms which
are mixed in with half-rotted leaves and scattered in the aviary shrubbery.
Other live food is supplied as available.
Nest
As with the Common Mynah, the Crested Mynah's nest is a collection
of rubbish--scraps of paper and cloth and tinfoil from around human
areas, and green leaves, twigs, the inevitable snake slough and anything
else which can be utilized. The criterion for selecting material seems to
be, " What any other, self-respecting species would ignore "! The nest
is placed, in a hole, inside a hollow tree, in a cavity in a house or a pagoda
under the eaves. The abandoned nests of magpies or kingfishers are
favourite sites, for which vying pairs will squabble and fight in a hilariously
noisy rough and tumble.
Fig. 3.--Nest-box with nest built by Crested Mynah.
In my aviary I noticed no nest-building intention behaviour which
was not surprising as there was no supply of nesting material nor any
nest-boxes. However, one day I cut all the grass of the lawn in the
aviary, and distributed the considerable amount of long grass collected in
a few piles amongst the bushy shrubs along the rear wall of the flight.
A few days later I noticed that a fair amount of the grass was strewn about
inside the house, and a small limp pile was placed on the top of a pillar by
a doorjamb. I realized that if they nested they would have to be returned
to the zoo before rearing any young, but still placed an old cockatiel box
in the house in the hope of recording any interesting behaviour.

<bodyText confidence="0.98001344117647" page_id="58089184"  page_num="167" year="" vol="">
A nest was rapidly built and after a few days completed. I had added
bamboo leaves, scraps of paper and iris leaves, but only grass was utilized,
and a fantastic amount was used in filling up the box. The nest was a
simple cup (see illustration) which enabled the bird inside to see out by
simply raising its head, or remain unseen if it sat tight, the bowl was that
near the level of the hole. I never saw either bird carrying grass, but one
of them (always the same one, for they had very different characters and
could be recognized by their behaviour) would sometimes hide in the box
if I stayed in the flight. No eggs were laid.
Eggs
The eggs number four, five or six (they ought to be six always to bear
out the " Eight Brothers " theory) and are a pale greenish-blue, smooth
and glossy. Nesting begins in April and most pairs are double-brooded.
Breeding
It has been bred in confinement, and in Hopkinson's Record of Birds
Bred in Captivity is the following passage:
" Butler (AGB, ii, 46): ' Russ states that Wiener bred sp. successfully
in 1875; but if he did, he has not mentioned the fact anywhere that
I am aware of. ' Neunzig, however, without any note of doubt says
' bred in 1875 by Wiener in London
Having whetted the reader's appetite, I am afraid I have no record at all
of a breeding, successful or otherwise, so I cannot offer any useful
historical information, other than the above quote from Hopkinson.
Fairly obviously, though, the species would take to a nest-box of the
kind that one would supply to other species of Starling and Mynah--that
is to say, an upright oblong box, measuring about 14 in. x 10 in. x 8 in.
from front to back. This would be adequate. However, it would need
a lot of nesting material and a couple of handfuls of straw would hardly
be a beginning. When rearing young, the adults would need large and
regular supplies of different live foods--mealworms and maggots are in
free supply now, but wild caught food ranging from leatherjackets obtained
by leaving soaking sacks on the lawn or meadow, to spiders, caterpillars,
and, of course, grasshoppers. In my experience, with birds of this kind,
the main obstacle to successful rearing is adequate food supply.

Spreo was excited, too, and after hopping around excitedly, joined in,
but could not stand the pace and retired after a minute or two. It lasted
about five minutes, I would say, and was followed by some gentle chasing
of one bird by the other.
General Notes
They are peaceable birds, mixing amiably with birds more or less of
their own size. It would be senseless to add them to a mixed collection
containing small birds such as waxbills, for apart from the possibility
that the Mynahs might take a fancy to one (unlikely) or take eggs or callow
young (quite likely), these birds fly around a great deal and are very
active. This would keep any small bird in a state of nervous tension and
would not do any good at all. At the time of writing, my Chinese Crested
Mynahs are sharing an enclosure with a house measuring 11 ft. x 9 ft. x 7 ft.
high at the peak, and a planted flight of 17 ft. x 11 ft. x 6 ft. high. This
is shared with a pair of California Quail, a male Spreo Starling, a pair of
Silver-eared Mesias, a hen Thai Glossy Starling and a pair of Roller
Canaries. Until a short while ago, there were also some Siberian
buntings. All are happy and co-habit without complication.
I do not know if the Mynahs are a true pair, and I will not be putting
up nest-boxes as I am about to move to Denmark for a couple of years,
and so will have to wrap up my bird-keeping activities in England.
I do not trust any birds when breeding, and am usually very watchful.
In the above collection the supplies of live food would have to be enough
to keep the other birds happy, as well as rear the Mynah young, if I were
to leave them all together safely. The biggest danger would be for any
newly hatched Quail chicks, which would probably be used to feed the
newly hatched Mynah chicks. Preserving such an artificial balance of
nature would not be to my taste.
That they are tough and hardy birds is certain, for mine have been
outside without heat for most of the winter. It is useful to remember
that winter in most parts of China is not very bright and warm, and in
many areas is positively unfriendly.
I do not regard it as a cage bird, but then I do not really regard the Hill
Mynahs as a cage bird either, and yet most people keep them in cages.
In China all the Crested Mynahs are kept in cages and they do become
tame and devoted to their owners. Perhaps, like most birds of prey and
parrots, they do not need free flight exercise to keep fit and healthy.
The Thai Crested Mynah
The Siamese or Thai Crested Mynah (A. grandis) ranges through
Malaysia, Thailand and the southern part of Viet-nam. It is slightly
smaller than the Chinese Crested Mynah, being as big as one of the smaller
Hill Mynahs. In appearance, it is very similar to A. cristatellus , being

black with white markings on the wings and tail. The beak and feet are a
stronger yellow than on A. cristatellus, and the crest is much better
developed. Another distinguishing feature is that the eyes are bright
reddish brown. Deignan says that it is abundant and is a permanent
resident in suitable territory in the northern lowlands of Thailand. It
would appear to be very similar in habit to the Chinese bird; wherever
man has pushed the jungle back and either put the land to the plough or
pasture, then the Crested Mynah will be found. As in China, it can
usually be seen on the backs of cattle or around their feet catching insects
disturbed in the grass. After the harvest, these Mynahs can be seen
gleaning the rice from the dry fields. I have not found any reference to
this in the Chinese literature and my birds appear not to take seed--no
doubt, they would if the succulent food was withheld.
During the rainy periods Deignan says it is a regular visitor to the
lawns of parks and gardens, feeding on the earthworms that have come to
the surface. It is a tame and fearless bird that will walk within a yard of
an observer, but when pursued will avoid capture by hopping, resorting
to the wing only when compelled to.
Obviously the differences between A. grandis and A. cristatellus are
marginal. I do not know if it has been bred in confinement at all; it
probably has, but I am not aware of any record in the U.K. I imagine
it would not present any difficulty, providing the keeper could maintain
adequate supplies of suitable food. I suggest that in all treatment it
should be prescribed for as the Chinese Crested Mynah.

By William H. Timmis (Curator of Birds and Mammals)
The Superb Bird of Paradise ( Lophorina superba ) is found over a wide
range of the mid-mountain forests and forest edges throughout New
Guinea, from 3,200 to 7,250 ft.
Eight sub-species are known, mostly distinguished by the females:
L. s. superba , L. s. niedda, L. s. feminina , L. s. pseudoparatia , L. s. latipennis ,
L. s. connectens , L. s. minor and L. s. sphinx. The species to which this
breeding refers is Lophorina superba feminina , from the Weyland and Snow
Mountains to Hindenburg, Victor Emanuel, Giluwe, Hagen, Kubor and
Bismark Mountains.
The adult male is a black bird with patches of iridescence, an elongated
cape on hind-neck and a shield on fore-breast; the upperparts are black
except for crown which is iridescent blue-green, violet gloss on central
tail feathers and bronzy gloss on dorsal cape which has lateral plumes up
to 130 mm. long, iris blackish; the bill is black, feet blackish-blue, inside
of mouth pale yellow.
The female has no ornamental plumes, the upperparts are greyish-
brown, crown dark brown with white flecks, an irregular whitish streak
from lores over eye to side of head and nape, a broad dark brown streak
through the eye, wings and tail are dull brown, wings have a broad
chestnut edge, the underparts greyish tinged with buff and with narrow
blackish-brown bars, iris dark brown, bill black, feet black.
Our pair of Superbs arrived in December 1966, along with several
other species of Birds of Paradise, as a gift from Sir Edward Hallstrom.
They were placed in aviaries inside the large Tropical House for the
winter and arrangements were made to plant and set up several outside
aviaries in order to attempt breeding.
On the 19th May 1967 the pair of Superbs were placed in an aviary
which measures some 8 ft. wide and 20 ft. long with an inside area about
8 ft. cube. At first the birds spent a great deal of time outside in all
weathers, especially the rain. They showed no signs of nesting until
early March 1968 when the male was observed feeding the hen and dis-
playing to her. The display took place in the top of a large fir branch;
he crouched low on his perch partially spreading his wings and expanded
his breast plate to its fullest extent. The cape was erected so that it
stood above the head like an enormous ruff; the long lateral feathers
practically met in front; he then danced very vaguely, and at regular
intervals gave a series of harsh screams with the mouth wide open, showing
bright yellow lining. In the Arfak mountains the Superb is known by
the native name of Niedda which is the perfect description of the harsh
cry.

W. H. TIMMIS--BREEDING OF THE SUPERB BIRD OF PARADISE 171
On the 19th March 1968 the female was observed carrying nesting
material into the top of the fir tree just a few inches from the roof netting.
The bird keepers were instructed to collect dry grasses and root fibres, etc.,
and an old blackbirds' nest was broken up and placed on the aviary floor.
On the 28th March the female was sitting on the nest all day and on the
30th one egg was laid. The nest itself was a deep firm cup composed
chiefly of dry grass and root fibres which had been bent and woven around
so as to make a rather neat structure. It rested on several small forking
branches, but on one side some of the stems forming the nest had been
carried around a small branch to anchor it more firmly in the bottom of
the nest. After the first layer of stems a considerable number of small
dead leaves had been laid flat and on top of this the hen had placed a
considerable quantity of dead fir needles. The male was not observed
helping in any way with the nest building.
The egg was brownish-buff in colour with spots, dots and longitudinal
markings of brown, reddish-brown and secondary greys. The egg is very
large in comparison with the size of the bird.
The female incubated until the 17th April, when egg-shell was found
under the nest and a chick was observed in the nest. Throughout the
incubation period the male spent most of his time perched directly
beneath the nest and when the female came off to feed and bathe he emitted
his harsh cry until she returned to the nest. On two occasions he was
observed offering mealworms to the female as she came off the nest prior
to the hatching of the egg. Large numbers of locust hoppers were
placed in the aviary along with wood lice and numerous other insects.
On the 21 st April the chick was found dead and had been killed by the
male; both legs had been ripped off and the abdomen had been damaged
severely. The chick was without a trace of down; its skin was blackish
flesh, paler below; bill greyish flesh, gape white, inside of mouth flesh,
feet greyish flesh.
It was decided that if the female made another attempt to nest, the male
would be removed as soon as an egg was laid. I should think that in the
wild the male Superbs have a common calling place in a definite tree where
they make their mating calls and displays. The females probably come
to these calling places only when they wish to be mated. After pairing,
the females withdraw and build their nests alone, lay eggs and feed their
young without any help from the male; he probably mates several females
during the breeding season.
On the 23 rd April our hen started to build a new nest on top of the old
one; on the 29th one egg was laid and the male was separated immediately.
This egg was hatched on the 18th May and once again large quantities of
locust hoppers and insects were offered, along with the normal diet. The
development of the chick was very much like that of a Starling; eyes were
open at six days old. At eight days quills were showing down the centre

of the back and quills on the wings had begun to open. On the 10th
day the head, back and wings were feathered.
The chick came off the nest for about 20 minutes on the 5th June and
was off the nest all morning on the 6th. On the 7th it was off the nest all
day returning at night. On the 10th it was making short flights from
three to five feet and by the 12th was able to fly rather clumsily the full
length of the aviary. The chick resembles the female in colouration,
except that the breast and lower parts are almost black with slight whitish
flecks. So far as I am aware this is the first time that this particular
species of Bird of Paradise has been bred in captivity.
As described by William H. Timmis, the Superb Bird of Paradise
(Lophorina superba ) has been bred at Chester Zoo. It is believed that this
may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at
once with the Hon. Secretary.

BREEDING OF THE WHITE-NAPED HONEY-
EATER (Melithreptus lunatus) IN THE SAN DIEGO
ZOOLOGICAL GARDEN
By Kenton C. Lint (Curator of Birds, San Diego Zoological Garden,
San Diego, California, U.S.A.)
The Honeyeater family (Meliphagidae) is one of the dominant and most
characteristic families of Australia, New Zealand and the islands of the
South-west Pacific.

Brush-like tongues designed to sweep nectar from flowers characterize
the honeyeaters. Most of the 160 species are small birds--only a few
exceeding a jay in size. All have slender pointed bills and long extensible
tongues. Many are drably coloured in greenish-browns, greys and yellows.
All have ten primaries and rather pointed wings. The tail may be short
or long, as this group is so varied. The legs are short and strong. They
live in the forests and brushland and feed, as their name implies, on flower
nectar and insects.
The honeyeater's special form of food gathering, with the bird's
plumage constantly brushing on flowers, makes them " avian pollinators ".
They are thought to have evolved with the great eucalyptus forests of
Australia which, with other flowering trees, provide their food.
The White-naped Honeyeater, Mel-i-threp-tus-(G K, meli, honey;
Threptos , nourished): lu-na-tus-( L, lunatus , moon-shaped=markings),
also called the Lunuated Honeyeater and Blackcap, is usually seen in
small flocks throughout the coastal districts, timbered mountain ranges

and open forest country inland. I observed individuals in Queensland
and Victoria, but they also range to Western Australia and the Kent
Group (Bass Strait) in certain seasons. They are small birds 54 in. in
length. The sexes are identical in colour, green above, white below,
with black heads and a white crescent band on the nape, giving them their
name.
We received four White-naped Honeyeaters on 9th September 1966 in
an exchange with the Melbourne Zoological Gardens, Australia, through
the co-operation of its fine director J. H. Sullivan. After the necessary
quarantine and observation period at our zoo hospital, the birds were
placed on exhibit in the Hummingbird Aviary. There the birds could
feed on the nectar formula of the hummingbirds and could also share the
Drosophila (fruit flies) and mealworms (Tenebrio molitor ), supplemental
insectivorous food of the tanagers, honey-creepers and bush-robins.
There the activities of the group afforded an excellent opportunity to
study them and to collect data on any nestling activities.
We believe honeyeaters do not mature until two to three years of age.
In our experience, this group showed no interest in nesting until this year.
Ernest Morrow, Bird Keeper in the Hummingbird Aviary, was en-
couraged to work with the honeyeaters, particularly to stimulate nesting
activities. Small welded wire containers holding coloured yarn, wool
fibre, dog hair, horse hair, grasses, fern fronds, feathers, cotton and
spider webs for nesting materials, were placed in several locations in the
aviary.
Their nesting habits are typical of most of the family in that they build
an open cup-shaped nest and lay two to three eggs.
On nth April 1968 we observed one pair of birds carrying grass fibres
and pieces of cotton to one of the hanging baskets of fuchsias in the aviary.
This beautiful fuchsia (Fuchsia autumnal ), with bronze, orange, yellow
and green leaves and small single red flowers, was selected with care as a
nesting site. Both male and female honeyeaters work in building the
nest. First a frame was woven of grass and plant fibres from one of the
wood branches. In two weeks this cotton and grass fibre nest was
completed. It measured 7 in. in length and 4 in. in diameter. It was
built 6 ft. above one of the ornamental foot bridges at the east end of the
aviary. This location was ideal for close observation.
Two eggs were laid, white in colour, spotted with reddish-brown at the
largest end. The first egg was laid on 2nd May with the second the
following day. The female proved to be a very stable individual, in-
cubating the eggs closely. Incubation began with the laying of the first
egg and was carried out entirely by the female. The male guarded the
nest and carried food to the female so she would not be forced to leave the
nest and eggs unattended. We were somewhat worried with the location
of the nest as it was vulnerable to the other miscellaneous birds living in
the same aviary.

One egg hatched on 15th May and the second egg did not hatch. The
first egg shell was immediately removed from the nest and dropped to the
ground. An incubation period of 13 days was recorded for the hatching
of our first Honeyeater chick.
The young, when hatched, are nidicolous , as is said of birds whose
young remain in the nest for some time after hatching. A white sparse
down covers the nestling.
Honeyeater nestlings are fed only small insects and nectar during the
first few weeks of their lives. Later they will welcome mealworms,
blueberries, raisins, currants, cotoneaster, pyracantha berries, diced
apple, banana, egg yolk, bread and milk, the staple diet of frugivorous and
insectivorous birds. Live food in the form of fruit flies ( Drosophila
melanogaster ) were seen to be fed for the first six days. We observed
both male and female feeding the nestling after capturing and swallowing
10 to 12 drosophila before returning to the nest.
When the containers were placed in the aviary with live Drosophila the
parent honeyeaters would come to the containers and catch the fruit flies
as they crawled along the sides of the container to reach the top before
flying. Twenty fruit flies per feeding appeared to make a meal for the
nestling. We provided fruit flies three times daily for the parents, at
9 a.m., 1 p.m., and 6 p.m.
The chick grew rapidly and as we wished to record the age at which the
eyes first opened we carefully watched the growth process. The eyes
began opening on the seventh day and were completely open on the follow-
ing day.
Mealworms ( Tenehrio molitor ) were accepted by the nestling from the
parent birds at the age of seven days. Two mealworms, one from each
parent, were eagerly swallowed by the chick with the Drosophila at the
regular feeding times.
No other food was taken by the nestling until the twelfth day. A
small amount of bread and milk was carried from one of the feeding pans
by the male bird and accepted by the nestling on this day. Later,
blueberries, soaked raisins and diced banana were fed to the nestling as
he grew in size.
We are pleased that the White-naped Honeyeater has successfully bred
in captivity in the Zoological Gardens of San Diego. We realize the data
collected is fragmentary in the interesting family Meliphagidae, but hope
we have stimulated interest in this unusual group of birds. There is a
definite need for more detailed observations of both wild and aviary birds
in this interesting family of Australian birds.

By A. A. Prestwich (Edenbridge, Kent, England)
The Great Eagle-Owl is a favourite exhibit in Zoological Gardens and
;here can be but few in Europe that have not had it on display at one time
3r another. And many have successfully bred it, too.
The subjoined table does not profess to be complete, not all zoos
aublish their breeding results. It does, however, give some indication
rf the frequency of the breeding of this species. It will be seen that
during the period 1959-1967 success was recorded by no less than 30
zoos. It would seem that given the right accommodation a pair wishful
to breed will do so, despite the presence of the public.

It is not, however, the present intention to deal with successes obtained
mainly in zoos, but to give a chronological and narrative account of events
in the aviaries of private aviculturists in Great Britain, with but passing
mention of zoos.
Before passing on, mention should be made of the chief sources of
increase at the present time in this country. The Zoological Society of

recorded many successful events. Nowadays young are reared almost
annually, with monotonous regularity. The Chester Zoo is also very
successful: the same pair have reared young every year since 1962, 25
young in seven years. The Norfolk Wildlife Park, co-operating with
the Swedish authorities at Skansen in their endeavour to re-establish this
species in the wild in Sweden, has sent six pairs of young owls to Sweden
since 1964. And mention should perhaps be made of the breeding
pair at Dudley Zoo that reared young regularly up to 1958 and possibly
later.
Bubo bubo bubo. Could any scientific name be more euphonious?
But what does Bubo mean? The name has long been in use. Pliny
used it nearly two thousand years ago when he wrote, rather unkindly:
" The Bubo is a fatal bird, of evil omen beyond other sorts, especially
at public auguries; it lives in desert places, and not merely those that
are unpeopled, but those also hard of access: monster of the night it
utters not a song, but only a groan. It never flies where it intends,
but is borne off aslant."
Bubo is a word in general use medically, but it has an alternative meaning
more appropriately applied to this owl, " to cry like a bittern ".
Edward Fountaine bred Eagle-Owls at Easton, Norfolk, for some
twenty-five years. Fountaine gave a full account of the period 1849-1859.
The female had been in confinement twenty years before Fountaine
procured her, but the male was said to be only one year old. They were
housed in a large cage, about 8 ft. square and about the same height.

understood how to take them out of the shell. I could have saved the
young bird this year if I had been at home. I found on one occasion a
young bird egg-bound, which it took me three days to take from the shell.
This bird lived and was brought up."
A little later Fountaine wrote: " A pair of Eagle Owls bred by me in
confinement have lately laid three eggs and hatched one young bird.
This is the first instance that any of the eggs of my birds, produced by
individuals bred themselves in confinement, have proved fertile. The
female which laid these eggs is ten years old, the cock about half that
age." In the account previously quoted he had written: " Three pairs
of the Owls which I brought up in confinement have at different times
laid eggs and sat on them, but the eggs have never proved good."
From i860 to 1864 the story is continued by Henry Stevenson in his
Birds of Norfolk. After dealing with the earlier successes, he writes:
" In i860, a pair of young birds brought up one nestling, but there were
none from the old pair. In 1861, two young ones were brought up by
the old pair only. In 1862, an old blind female, presented to Mr.
Fountaine some time ago, paired off with a male hatched in 1850, and two
young birds were brought up. In the same year a young pair also had
one nestling, but which was instantly devoured by its unnatural parent,
in consequence, says Mr. Fountaine, ' of my putting a hen's egg under her
to keep her on the nest until she was inclined to sit, and as I forgot to take
away the hen's egg she hatched it and ate it, and served her own young
one the same No young that year from the original pair. In 1863
the blind bird laid, but her eggs proved of no use. The old pair brought
up one nestling, and the young pair also had one young one, but the hen
bird pulled its head off when about two weeks old, in consequence, it is
supposed, of her being alarmed one night by the light of a lantern. In
1864, another young pair nested towards the end of February, and laid
three eggs, but from the severity of the weather and high winds all the
time there was not sufficient warmth to hatch them. Neither the original
pair, nor the blind female, did anything this year, but another young pair
had three good eggs, which should have been hatched in the end of April,
but, in Mr. Fountaine's absence, these were unfortunately taken away
under the impression they were bad. In spite of all these disappointments,
however, Mr. Fountaine has now in his possession twenty-six of these
noble birds, and has given away thirteen others at different times. They
* A somewhat similar incident is described in the Bull. B.O.C., xxxiii, vol. v,
p. xxi, and Ibis , 1896: 261: " Mr H. M. Wallis exhibited three eggs laid by a
Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetus), which had been about thirty years in confinement,
and began to lay eggs about fifteen years ago. The eggs having been taken and
those of a Domestic Fowl substituted, the Eagle hatched three of the latter and
reared three fine birds, feeding them principally on the flesh of rats. One of these
fowls, a cockerel, was slain by his foster-mother, but the others had thriven. A
photograph was exhibited, showing the Eagle and the fowls."

are fed on rats, rabbits, and small birds. A young pair of these owls
in Mr. Gurney's aviary at Catton, the offspring of Mr. Fountaine's old
pair, also hatched for the first time in i860, when they brought up two
young ones; in 1861, two more, and in 1862, three young ones. In 1863,
three were hatched and two brought up; and, in 1864, two were reared
and presented to Mr. Fountaine, to supply his losses." According to
J. H. Gurney, Fountaine was still breeding them in 1875.
E. G. B. Meade-Waldo writes: " Our first nest this year [1899] was
that of the old Eagle Owls, who hatched two young ones on April 3rd--
this is fully a month later than usual. Both young were reared: which
make ninety-seven reared during my lifetime. Hardly any eggs have
been laid but what have been hatched, and no young one has ever died,
with the exception of one that was choked; the old pair going on year after
year having their two or three young as regular as clockwork." J. H.
Gurney (1899) sa Y s Meade-Waldo's owls " have bred regularly since
1864, namely 32 years, having in that time reared no less than 93 young
ones ", by which time the old parents were 68 and 53 years old.
Major S. S. Flower says: " Meade-Waldo told me that the female,
mentioned by Gurney in 1899 as being still alive at the age of 68 years,
died at that age, and that two, presented to the London Z.G., 20.3.1927,
had both been bred in the Meade-Waldo aviaries, one in 1882, the other
in 1899, parents in each case being the old pair that had belonged to
Meade-Waldo's father."
An early report is in The Field , 4th May, 1872, p. 398, where we read:
" At a meeting of the Croydon Microscopical Club, held on the 17th ult.,
a paper was read by Mr. N. L. Austen, F.L.S., on the nesting of the
Eagle Owl at Croydon." In 1871 two young, a male and a female, were
fully reared. The young female " choked herself in November last with
a rabbit-bone while feeding ". The parents nested unsuccessfully in
early spring, 1872.
J. L. Bonhote (1910) writes: " the only young one I have reared is
seven years old and still alive and well. . . The old pair . . . persistently
refuse to feed their young. In 1904 she had three nests and hatched
eight young."
Miss E. F. Chawner reared one young one in 1913 from birds bred by
Meade-Waldo. The young one passed into the possession of Sir G.
Tyrwhitt-Drake. For the five years previous the hen had laid two clutches
and incubated them without result. A later young one is mentioned,
but there is no confirmation of its being reared. In 1915, however,
another young one was fully reared.
Miss Chawner, recording the results for 1928 in the Spedan Lewis
Owlery, writes: " Three eggs laid and all hatched; the third nearly a
week after the others. All went well for six weeks and a plentiful supply
of rabbit was given twice daily. But just as the nestlings had begun to
feather and were using their wings they all ' went light ' and died in a

because a pair of adults and their three 1929 young are listed in the
Spedan Lewis Sale Catalogue.
Herbert Whitley had a successful breeding pair, 1929, three; 1930,
two; 1931, " The hen is sitting on half-grown young."
A. F. Moody says the species " appears to be a free breeder, very hardy,
and long-lived in captivity "; that a pair was bred at Lilford in 1931, and
that they " reared their young " in 1932.
J. F. M. Floyd gives a graphic account of his success with this owl.
In 1938 or 1939(F) three young were hatched and reared. They were
possibly a female and two males: the former eventually decapitated the
latter. The following year three more were hatched, but disappeared in
the downy stage.
Reference have been kept to a minimum. Much of the foregoing has
previously been published in the special Birds of Prey number of the
Magazine, May--June 1949, and " Records of Birds of Prey Bred in
Captivity ", 1955, and full references may be found there.

HILL MYNAHS BREEDING IN ARTIFICIAL
NESTS IN THE GARO HILLS DISTRICT OF
ASSAM, INDIA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99922305" page_id="58089199"  page_num="180" year="" vol="">
By B. C. R. Bertram (Cambridge, England)
The Indian Hill Mynah or Grackle (Gracula religiosa ) is a wary arboreal
bird in the wild state in its evergreen forest habitats in south-west and
north-east India. It is widely known for its prowess as a talking bird
when in captivity, for it surpasses even the parrots in the accuracy of its
imitations. A Hill Mynah will learn to talk well only if it has been taken
from the nest while young, and since they are wary birds and nest usually
in inaccessible holes in trees, the taking of their young is often a difficult
problem. The difficulty is reduced in the Garo Hills District of Assam
where the Hill Mynahs are persuaded to breed in artificial nests. Such
a nest consists of a framework of split bamboo about 5 ft. long and 1 ft.
wide at the middle, tapering towards each end; this is thickly covered on
the outside with thatching straw tied tightly down onto the framework.
A hole is cut about two-thirds of the way from the slightly thicker lower
end of the nest, which is then attached to the branches of a tree at an angle
of about 45 0 , with the hole at the higher end and facing downwards. The
trees chosen are usually tall, and are situated in or at the edge of clearings
in the forest, or at the edge of a small village; the artificial nests are placed
at or near the tops of the trees. A Garo may have four or five of these
nests, in different trees, and by observation he can tell when there are
young birds in the nest. Usually he does not want to run the risk of
their fledging and escaping, and so he takes the young from the nest
earlier than is desirable, feeds them on a barely adequate diet of moistened
gram-powder made into large plugs and pushed into the gaping throat,
and then sells them at the weekly village market at prices usually between
1 os. and #1. Dealers then take them on via Goalpara to Calcutta.
The practice of putting up these artificial nests in the Garo Hills is an
old one, certainly much older than the recent huge demand for young Hill
Mynahs for export. It is not done in other parts of India for the catching
of Hill Mynahs; possibly it arose as a simple way of catching birds,
indiscriminately of species, in order to eat them. As do the hill people of
Orissa and Nepal, the Garos also catch the young of any Hill Mynahs they
find nesting naturally in holes in trees, but the majority of young Hill
Mynahs leaving Assam for a life in captivity have probably been hatched
in these artificial basket nests. The advantages to the Garo are obvious:
he has a good source of revenue, collected with little difficulty since the
nests are reasonably accessible (to a Garo!); he can observe the nests
easily and can take the young before they fledge; and having the nests
often near his hut he can prevent the young birds from being taken by his
neighbour--it is obvious to whom they belong. But what makes the Hill

Mynahs, which usually nest only in tree holes, make use of bamboo-and-
?rass baskets is difficult to understand; obviously there may be many
possible reasons for it. But since birds which nest in these baskets
rarely succeed in rearing any young, there must be very strong selection
pressure against the habit; perhaps in a couple of decades they will scarcely
do so any more.
A few thousand young Hill Mynahs are taken out of Assam each year,
largely for export. This represents quite a large drain, but it is less
serious than it would appear for two reasons: first, that if the young birds
are taken from the nest, the parents usually nest again, and second, that
the taking of young Hill Mynahs from Assam is at present largely confined
to the Garo Hills District only. Control measures would be easy to
apply in theory, but are probably not yet necessary; they may well become
necessary if the trade in these birds continues to expand.

SUCCESSFUL BREEDING OF CASSOWARIES AT
THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK,
EDINBURGH
By G. D. Fisher (Director-Secretary)
The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland's present pair of Cassowaries

(Casuarius casuarius) arrived in 1963, when the birds were still in immature
plumage and approximately 18 months old.
They first mated in 1965, when five eggs, subsequently proved to be
fertile, were destroyed after five weeks of incubation due to an unfortunate
fight between the parents. Inquiries had revealed a difference of opinion
as to whether Cassowaries mated only once before the laying of a clutch,
or whether copulation was necessary between the laying of each egg, and
assuming the former as well as to prevent the possibility of further
accident the birds were separated after the first egg had been laid in 1966.
Two other eggs were laid at six-day intervals, which were then given to
the male who undertakes the entire duties of incubation and tending of the
chicks, but eventually only one egg hatched, the other two being infertile.
It is regretted that the first egg had not been marked for identification,
but it is confidently assumed that it was the first to be laid, following
mating by the parents, and that it is essential for Cassowaries to copulate
between the laying of each egg. The male showed no interest in this
solitary chick, and although hand-feeding was continually tried it died in
four days.
During 1965 and 1966 it had been noted that the smaller male bird was
inclined to scrape and scatter the nesting material placed in one corner of
his half of the hut, so in preparation for 1967 breeding the floor was covered
with a 5 in. layer of peat-moss; also, to facilitate feeding with least

disturbance, the bottom of the gate in the weldmesh partition was raised
4 in. from the floor, enabling food and water trays to be slipped underneath.
To ensure fertilization of all the eggs in 1967, but to reduce the risk of
accident to a minimum, it was decided to separate the birds when the full
clutch had been deposited, but in the end this was not done until the
second chick had hatched.
The Cassowaries started mating in mid-March 1967, approximately the
same time as in the two previous years, continuing for two weeks during
which numerous acts of copulation were observed. Then on 13th April
the female laid her first egg on the peat moss in a corner of the male's
compartment of the hut, and this was immediately accepted and brooded
by her mate. The second egg was laid on 18th April, and the third and
final egg on 22nd April. Mating was again observed between the laying
of these eggs. Though continuing to sit closely, the male frequently
cohabited with the female, feeding alongside her and even accompanying
her on brief visits into the enclosure. It would appear, therefore, that the
fight of 1965 occurred due to the female having become frightened, and
irritating the brooding male by racing into the hut.
The first chick hatched on 5th June, and it was observed that its first
meal consisted of portions of the shell from which it emerged, this being
broken into small fragments by the male. The second chick hatched on
6th June, and at this stage the partition gate separating the parent birds
was closed. The third chick hatched on 8th June but was accidentally
crushed by the male as it emerged from the shell,
therefore, were as follows:

In comparison with the above times it is interesting to note that the five
eggs of 1965 were laid at six-day intervals, and that the incubation period
of the chick hatched in 1966 was eight weeks.
During the first six days the chicks were disappointing feeders, and the
male bird was not taking his usual meals. The start of more serious
feeding was, perhaps, due to a chance act on the part of the keeper. It
had been thought advisable to break down the various ingredients of the
diet into small particles, but although the male examined these, with the
two chicks running round his bill, there was no serious attempt at inducing
them to feed. One day, however, while crumbling wholemeal bread,
the keeper accidentally tossed a large piece of loaf into the paddock. The
male immediately became excited, broke it down with his bill, and called
to the chicks as he dropped the crumbs in front of them. Both chicks
then began feeding voraciously. Other ingredients of the diet (tomatoes,
bananas, etc.) were then offered in larger portions, and each was accepted

G. D. FISHER--SUCCESSFUL BREEDING OF CASSOWARIES 1 83
by the chicks after it had been broken down by the parent. Once feeding
freely, however, both male and chicks accepted food as it was offered,
and a finely chopped mixture was prepared including wholemeal bread,
bananas, pears, apples, grapes, tomatoes, carrots, chick crumbs, grass meal,
bone meal, horse meat and calcium; in addition the chicks accepted grit,
chiefly limestone and medium oyster shell. When finely chopped, the
fruit juices formed the dry ingredients into a stiff paste which the male
broke and scattered, but the chicks quickly learned to take it for them-
selves. For the first two weeks the male bird and chicks consumed only
4 lb. of the mixture daily; by the time the chicks were three weeks old,
however, they and the male were taking 16 lb. daily, and this had increased
to 25 lb. when the chicks were five weeks old. By comparison, at this
time, the female Cassowary was eating 12 lb. per day of a simpler diet.
The paddock supplied a certain amount of natural food. The chicks
were seen chasing and capturing insects, and the male plucked and offered
them grass which frequently seemed to pass through them without being
digested. That their digestion was remarkable, however, was demonstrated
when the male was observed to kill an immature starling which had flown
into the paddock. This he tore to pieces and offered to the chicks.
Considerable anxiety was experienced as one chick was seen endeavouring
to swallow an entire wing, starting with the base, and wandering round the
paddock, gulping, with the primary feathers protruding from its bill; but
everything eventually disappeared, nor were there any injurious after-
effects though the chick at the time was only three weeks old. This
experience prompted the offering of dead mice which were, and still are,
accepted.
All this while the female showed no signs of irritation at being isolated,
nor did she exhibit any interest in the chicks when they approached the
foot of the chainlink fencing dividing the paddocks. This lack of interest
was remarkably demonstrated shortly after the chicks first ventured out-
of-doors, when they both slipped through the 3 in. diamond mesh into the
passage-way leading from the female's half of the hut to her enclosure. It
was a possibility which had not been foreseen, and the writer, who was
present at the time, watched the female step carefully over the chicks
without evincing further interest in them. The male bird, however,
became frantic, and when the writer entered the passage-way, and passed
him one chick after another through the mesh, it was doubtless his relief
at their return that prevented the ferocious attack on the fence with
which he invariably opposed the approach, not only of strangers, but of
the keeper in charge. The writer had no sooner left the passage-way,
and was speaking to some onlookers as he re-locked the gate, than the
chicks re-entered the passage, crossed it, and then slipped through the
outer fence to the public path. The visitors were amused as they watched
the chicks being picked up, carried across the passage-way, and again
presented to the male bird who this time led them out into the paddock.

It was an unanticipated event which might have had serious consequences
under other conditions, and the Park's Works Department was hurriedly
summoned to prevent its repetition by fixing a skirting of fine-gauge
netting round the foot of the chicks' paddock fencing.
As the small paddock eventually became fouled, and no longer offered a
supply of fresh grass, it was extended by taking in a portion of the main
Cassowary enclosure. The nursery paddock was then cleaned and sanded,
and in this domain the two chicks have grown up into sturdy young
immature Cassowaries. When first hatched they were clad in attractively
camouflaged down of sepia and gold stripes; then the dark brown gradually
faded till the chicks had assumed a uniform honey colour; and this is
slowly darkening till, if all continues well, it will assume the rich deep
brown plumage in which their parents were clad when they first came to
the Park. The Cassowary chicks represent the most interesting birth in
the Park since the first King Penguin to be reared in captivity was hatched
in 1919.
As described by G. D. Fisher, the Cassowary (Casuarius casuarius) has
been bred at the Scottish National Zoological Park. It is believed that
this may be a first success.

Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at once

It was in the spring of 1967, just one year after the Winged World was
opened, that the opportunity arose to obtain a pair of Green Wood
Hoopoes (Phoeniculus purpureus) from Messrs. David Roberts Wildlife in
East Africa. We assumed from the outset that the birds were a true pair
as there was a definite difference in size, the cock bird being slightly
larger and having a longer bill. The hen appeared to be immature as
her bill was still basically black, but this changed to the adult red colouring
soon after arrival.
They were housed in a glass-fronted planted aviary in company with a
White-headed Wood Hoopoe and many other softbills including Red-
fronted Barbets, Blue-winged Pittas, Grey-hooded Kingfishers and Snowy-
headed and White-browed Robin Chats. They never showed any signs
of aggression towards these birds, and in fact seemed to enjoy the company
of the other Wood Hoopoe.

Several large rotten tree-trunks were provided for them, and within
these nesting cavities had been chiselled out from the back and then
covered, leaving only a small access hole visible in the front of the trunk.
Like all the barbets and tits for which this had been done elsewhere,
however, they scorned these " natural " nest holes and settled for a small
plywood box approximately 10 in. square, which had been suspended
from the roof of the compartment. Although the tree trunks were not
used for nesting the Wood Hoopoes certainly made good use of them,
clambering around searching the crevices for insects, using their tails in
the manner of the Woodpeckers.
They used the nest-box regularly for roosting in, and until they had
settled down, which took several weeks, they sought refuge in it whenever
their compartment was entered. Their diet consisted of our home-made
insectile mixture which is mixed with raw minced beef and is the standard
fare for practically all our frugivorous, omnivorous and insectivorous
species. They also received maggots, mealworms, crickets and blowflies,
and also raw shrimps which were provided for the Kingfishers.
As far as we could tell only the hen incubated the eggs, and she com-
menced sitting on 8th April of this year. Due to the position of the nest-
box and the smallness of the entrance hole it was impossible to see inside
without disturbing the birds. After 17 days it was apparent that some
eggs had hatched, as the hen appeared more frequently and both birds
began regular trips to the box with live food. Maggots, mealworms,
crickets and a few small locusts were fed for the first week and the raw
meat mixture was included thereafter.
Sixteen days later fully fledged chicks began appearing at the entrance
hole and ventured out two days later. There were four chicks and they
were about half the size of the adults. They had short, straight black
bills and lacked the glossiness and long tails of the parent birds, but
otherwise were similarly coloured except for having a definite brownish
throat. They were fed by both parent birds for just over three weeks, by
which time they seemed to be completely independent.
As described by Clive Roots, the Green Wood Hoopoe (Phoeniculus
purpureus) has been bred at Winged World, Heysham. It is believed
that this may be a first success.

By Clive Roots (Winged World, Heysham, Lancs., England)
We regularly read about the problems arising from feeding maggots
and mealworms to soft-billed birds. Problems which occur when these
larvae form the sole items of diet of nestlings, at least for the first week or
so; and of Bee-eaters and other exacting hawking species which are loathe
to accept inanimate foods. Almost as frequently we hear of attempts to
" improve " the quality of both maggots and mealworms by the addition
of certain items to their diet, or by dusting them with a supplement
before they are fed, without really knowing what food components are
lacking and need to be increased.
In an effort to throw some light upon this very important aspect of
aviculture, rather than rely upon assumption, samples of maggots and
mealworms have been submitted for analysis, and the results have proved
very interesting to say the least. In order to fully appreciate the notes
which follow, the results of the analyses will be given first. Only freshly
killed insects were analysed.

From these analyses it will be seen that the calcium and phosphorus
content of both forms of larvae is minute, and is certainly insufficient to
rear young birds. It is known that an adult bird can mobilize 25% of the
calcium required for egg-shell deposition from its body, and whilst it
would probably survive for a number of years upon a diet so low in calcium
and phosphorus, it is doubtful if such an intake would contribute sufficient
for the bird to be able to produce eggs. We know that Softbills seldom
become egg-bound, yet there have been two instances recently at the
Winged World when a Thailand Hoopoe became egg-bound after laying
two perfect eggs in each clutch. All other conditions were perfect and
were not thought to have contributed to that ailment. Due to the fact
that these birds were in a community aviary where maggots and mealworms
were available all day for the more exacting species, the Hoopoes had
concentrated their attentions upon these and had ignored the insectile
mixture which would have provided a balanced diet. Needless to say this
pair have now been moved to quarters where they can receive a more

)alanced diet, and the indications are that we may be more successful in
he future.
The relative lack of calcium and phosphorus in these larvae could have
jeen foreseen anyway of course, as they do not possess the skeletal system
which contains the majority of the ash content of the vertebrate body.
The skeletal deformities and other symptoms which nestling insectivorous
firds often show in captivity are certainly due to the lack of calcium and
phosphorus in their diet, and possibly to the fact that the small quantities
pf each are present in the wrong ratio, as much more calcium than
phosphorus is required to build bones. The vitamin requirements,
where the formation of bones is concerned, will be discussed later, as also
will the means of administering supplements to purely insect feeders.
The deficiency symptoms shown by nestlings which were reared or
almost reared upon these larvae alone have mainly been associated with
:he feet or legs, although perhaps it would be truer to say that it was most
pbvious there, as they were twisted, weak and useless. Beaks, too, have
bailed to harden and take their correct shape.
It will also be seen from the analyses that the fat content of mealworms
is higher than that of maggots. The same applies to the protein and
:arbohydrate content. Rather than compare the content of each of these
food nutrients separately, but as a total calorific content, it is necessary to
understand a little about the calorie values of foodstuffs. This is an
aspect of nutrition which to date seems to have been applied only to human,
and not to bird diets.
There are approximately four calories per gram of protein, just under
four in every gram of carbohydrate, and over double the quantity, just
over nine calories, in each gram of fat. When the composition of a diet
is known it is a simple matter to multiply the percentage of protein in
every ioo grams of food by four, and so on. On this basis the calory
content of mealworms is 204 and maggots 150 per 100 grams (approxi-
mately 4 oz.). Whilst not being the ideal ratio of fat and carbohydrate,
as birds can assimilate the latter easier, insectivorous species have survived
for several years upon maggots and mealworms alone. This life-span
would no doubt be extended if vitamins and mineral salts could somehow
be added to the diet.
Often we hear how " rich " mealworms are, and how sparingly they
should be fed, the inference being that this applies to all birds. Where
the insectivorous species are concerned the only thing rich about meal-
worms is the fantastic price they command. It is my contention that a
diet of a normal insectile mixture which has been moistened with fats or
oils, plus a few maggots daily, will provide a food intake far richer in fat,
and therefore more likely to cause obesity, than a diet of mealworms
alone.
Where frugivorous and omnivorous species are concerned it is a different
matter, of course, as they definitely require a lower intake of calories than

<bodyText confidence="0.998292288888889" page_id="58089211"  page_num="188" year="" vol="">
the insectivorous species. The addition of too many mealworms to a
diet already containing fruits rich in carbohydrate and fatty insectile
mixtures could just tip the scales in favour of obesity. Also, there is the
over-stimulating effect which mealworms have upon many species,
particularly amongst the omnivorous softbills.
The moisture content of these larvae is very high, being well over half
the content of the mealworm and almost three-quarters of the blowfly
maggot. It is not really surprising therefore that the Bee-eaters, and other
species which are not known to drink, can derive enough moisture from
their insect diet, which without doubt they do in captivity.
Unfortunately, analysing maggots and mealworms for their vitamin
content has not yet been undertaken, as this entails a far more costly
operation. At this stage it seems reasonable to assume that a deficiency
of vitamin D is also associated with the leg and feet deformities already
mentioned. Even if there were sufficient calcium and phosphorus in
the diet to form bones, this could not be done unless vitamin D was pre-
sent to assist in the metabolization of the minerals. In adult birds
vitamin D is manufactured by exposure of the skin to sunlight.
The vitamin which is definitely absent from both larvae, or at least
present in the most minute quantities, is vitamin A. We have heard of
cases of half-closed, watering eyes, followed by asthmatic breathing and
eventual blindness and death, of Bee-eaters fed for months solely upon
maggots and mealworms. Also of similar symptoms and losses amongst
newly imported Flycatchers, often so dependent upon live food for many
weeks. Frequently I have heard it said that this is " due to something in
the maggots, probably not cleaned properly ". On the contrary, it is not
something in the maggots, but something they are lacking. This has been
proved conclusively where the exacting East African Wattle-eyed and
Puff-backed Flycatchers are concerned. A few which were imported on a
diet of locusts and mealworms defied all attempts at meating off, and were
restricted to a diet of maggots and mealworms as they would not even
accept crickets and blowflies. Obviously they could not be released,
which is the normal procedure in the field with newly trapped birds
which will not accept inanimate foods. In a desperate attempt to save
the surviving members of the group a liberal dose of Abidec (rich in
vitamins A and D) was administered direct into the beak and within two
days the symptoms of watering eyes, dejection and heavy breathing,
had cleared up. The mistake was then made of adding the water soluble
Abidec to their drinking water, and soon afterwards it became necessary
to again adminster drops directly into their beaks. It soon became
obvious that these Flycatchers, like the Bee-eaters, did not drink, and we
have since added the vitamin A to the live food. We now use the oil
form of vitamin supplement, as this adheres to the larvae better, and since
commencing this treatment the symptoms mentioned earlier, which are
characteristic of vitamin A deficiency in other animals, have not recurred.

Several methods of administering supplements to birds which are
feeding solely upon maggots and mealworms have been tried, from all
accounts. Often though these appear to have been supplements which
were intended to increase the protein content of the diet rather than the
vitamin and mineral content. As we have seen from the analyses protein
is present in sufficient quantity, and it is the minerals which need to be
added, plus vitamin A. Adding all the other available vitamins can do no
harm either. The administering of baby or invalid foods to the larvae,
both internally and externally, is not really solving the problem, as the
food items which are needed will be reduced to infinitesimal quantities
due to the small amount of the foodstuff which is ingested anyway.
The answer lies in providing purely a vitamin and mineral supplement
in a highly concentrated form, but once again administering this is not a
simple matter. There appears to be no evidence that vitamins and
minerals can be stored or retained in the body tissues of maggots and meal-
worms. Therefore if these larvae are fed upon highly enriched foods,
the small amounts present in their gut when they are eaten is all that
birds will receive. Maggots are unsuitable for this method anyway, as
their foodstuffs will be in varying stages of fermentation or decomposition
if the temperature at which they are kept is high enough to stimulate
feeding. The maggots should then be cleaned before they are fed to the
birds, which of course defeats the object of the exercise. A supplement
can certainly be added to the mealworms food, but this must be in a
highly concentrated, finely powdered form.
Maggots are more suitable than mealworms if it is intended to add the
supplement externally to the larvae, as they remain alive for some time
even when liberally coated with honey and powdered with the supplement.
Mealworms, not being adapted for a semi-fluid existence, do not survive
such treatment and are then not as readily accepted. Where vitamins are
concerned the best method seems to be the addition of a few drops of
highly concentrated vitamin oil, which adheres to the larvae, and does
not dry out as rapidly as the water bound form. Minerals in very finely
powdered form stick quite well to these moistened larvae.
Alternatively the larva can be injected with liquid calcium, e.g. Collo-
cal-D, and liquid vitamins if a very fine needle is used. Naturally the
amounts injected are minute, but as the additives will be in highly con-
centrated form this should be sufficient to rear healthy youngsters, and
will certainly fill the requirements of adult non-breeding birds. In which
case such a messy and tiresome task will have been well worth while.

As mentioned in the article by W. H. Timmis, the most outstanding
hatching during the year was a Superb Bird of Paradise. We are pleased
to report that the youngster is doing extremely well.
Other breeding rarities are Kookaburra chicks, which are still in their
nesting log in one of the aviaries in the Temperate Bird House. These
youngsters are thriving and we hope that we will be successful in rearing
them to maturity. At the time of writing the chicks are three weeks old;
they are by no means properly feathered yet and are of a rather ugly
appearance.
The Geese have done particularly well this year with 4 Barnacles, 2
Emperors, 4 Bar-headed and 1 Canada Goose hatched. Other species
which were hatched were Silver Pheasants, Peacocks, Bob-White Quails, a
Turquoisine Parrakeet, Great Eagle-Owls and a single Sclater's Crested
Curassow chick.
A newly arrived Sulphur-breasted Toucan (Rhamphastos sulphuratus)
has been accommodated in one of the aviaries at the top of the ramp in
the Tropical House. A Red-billed and a Laminated Hill Toucan are at
liberty within the confines of the Tropical House, but the latest arrival
will remain in the aviary for the time being.
A pair of Red-billed Pintails (Anas erythrorhyncha ) have been accom-
modated on the Small Mammal House Pond. This is the first time that
this species, which closely resembles the Bahama Pintail, has been ex-
hibited at Chester Zoo. A pair of Mandarin Ducks arrived at the same
time and have also been released on the Mammal House Pond.
The Rockhopper Penguins have been transferred from the pool which
they shared with Jackass and Humboldt's Penguins to new quarters in the
Otter and Penguin area. They can now be viewed whilst swimming
underwater in specially designed glass-fronted viewing tanks. When
they leave the tank they develop enough speed to jump from the water
and land upright on the bank, just as they do in the wild state when they
jump from the sea on to a rocky foreshore. In addition to the viewing
tank which holds 1,000 gallons of water, accommodation comprises a
large open-air pool, rockwork caves and walks and a water slide from the
viewing tank to the main pool.

Four West African Wood-Owls (Ciccaba woodfordii nuchalis) live
agether in one of the compartments of the Owls' Aviary during summer,
ieing brought in for the winter, and this summer a pair of them nested,
naking a scrape in the peat moss on the shelter floor, and hatched one chick
diich is now flying and sitting on the perches among the others. The
wo non-breeding birds, so far as is known, paid no attention to the pro-
eedings, and the presumed father (for he seemed to take a proprietorial
nterest in the nest and was sometimes standing by it) is a tame bird that
lies to the wire front on being called. The young bird is of a pale
;reyish-buff on the head and under-side, faintly barred with darker
&amp;gt;rownish; darker on the back with pale whitish spots, much like the
idults but not so dark a brown. This appears to be the first breeding in
his country. The usual clutch size is said to be one egg, and so far as is
mown only one was laid on this occasion. In i960 two Wood-Owls
lested here, but as the egg was infertile they were given one from Snowy
Dwls which was hatched and the chick reared by them.
An Abyssinian Eagle-Owl has also been bred, but this may not be a
irst success, for there is some evidence that this race bred at Leckford (see
Prestwich (1955), Records of Birds of Prey Bred in Captivity , p. 24)-
Only one Great Eagle-Owl has been bred here this year; Barn Owls have
1 second brood after rearing two young in the first nest. Other breedings
include one Cattle Egret, five more Sonnerat's Jungle fowl, seven Cheer
Pheasants, two Great Black-backed, two Herring and three Silver Gulls,
four Grey-headed Gallinules and four Grey-backed Thrushes. Two
Sarus Cranes have been hatched and the Grey-backed Thrushes have
young--actually their third family, for the second brood did not survive.
All three families were hatched in the original nest built on a window
ledge, and this is also believed to be a first breeding in this country.
Princess Stephanie's Bird of Paradise, at the third attempt this year,
hatched a chick, but it lived for only two days. She is now incubating a
fourth egg.
Azure-winged Magpies (one is of one of the Japanese races and the other
the Iberian Cyanopica cyana cooki) nested and hatched chicks which did
not survive.
A Rufous Tinamou ( Rhynchotus rufescensf an Abdim's Stork, a Crested
Guineafowl {Guttera edouardi) and two Livingstone s Turacos are new
arrivals of particular interest. Mr. Robin Restall brought a male
Californian Quail and four chicks. Following the death of the mother
this bird continued the incubation of the eggs and cared for the chicks.
Parrakeets received in exchange from the Melbourne Zoological
Gardens are King, Rock Peplar, Pileated and Pennant's, together with
four Black Swans. A Banksian Cockatoo received in 1934 has died.

Dr. David Livingstone relates an unpleasant custom in relation to th&amp;lt;
Grey Parrot. In his diary, which was published as Last Journals of Davit
Livingstone in Central Africa (1874), he writes: " The Manyuema are th&amp;lt;
most bloody, callous savages I know. One puts a scarlet feather from "
Parrot's tail on the ground, and challenges those near to stick it in theii
hair; he who does so must kill a man or woman."

According to a census made last year by the London Natural Histor]
Society, for the British Trust for Ornithology, there was a marked increase
in the number of Wrens in the London area. In 413 acres of woodlanc
there were 130 pairs, an increase of 50 pairs on 1966; and the number ir
729 acres of farmland was nearly doubled.
The Bullfinch showed a rise in number, but the Chaffinch, Greenfinch
Goldfinch and Linnet all fell.
The three most numerous birds in woodland were Robin, Wren
Blackbird; and in farmland Blackbird, Robin, Dunnock.

"We would have been extremely amused if someone had suggested to
ts an auction of stuffed birds. There seemed to be so many of them that
heir value would not justify the venture.'' So said a spokesman at
iotheby's sale on 9th July. Included in the sale were more than a
mndred lots, mostly from the Roman Catholic seminary Ushaw College,
Durham. The highest price paid was #110 for a Snowy Owl mounted
n i860. A Bearded Tit, shot in London in 1794, was bought by the
Jlster Museum for .#32; a Great Bustard went to David Attenborough
or #42; and a Golden Eagle with outstretched wings fetched #14. The
otal realized was .#2,268. But lest anyone should think that stuffed birds

One of the most eagerly awaited events of the year is the return of th&amp;lt;
House Martins. It has always been a matter of disappointment anc
surprise that they fail to nest with us--that is until this year. In the days
when we were trying to induce our colony of Red-faced Lovebirds tc
breed we imported a dozen artificial House Martin nests from Germany
The Lovebirds totally ignored them and, now that they are hung unde;
the eaves of the stables, they have likewise failed to have any impressior
on the House Martins. On the other hand, they have proved verj
acceptable to the House Sparrows. But this year a pair of House Martins
did decide to nest, but in a rather inconvenient position--immediatel)
above the front door. This has meant that the door has had to remair
closed for several weeks. Fortunately, the majority of our visitors share
and understand our interest in birds, and are only too willing to co-
operate by using other entrances. The opportunity to study them al
such close quarters has been very rewarding. It is a pity, however, thal
they have made rather a mess. They are now preparing to nest a seconc
time.

morning appearance. As the day progressed his absence became more
noticeable and when he had not appeared by nightfall we thought thal
he must surely have fallen victim to a predator. Or was Fred really a
" she " and had gone to nest? Day followed day without any sign and we
had given him up for lost when, after nearly three weeks, he reappeared.
But how his appearance had changed! Gone was the sleek, well-groomed
bird we knew; now, in his stead, we had a very disreputable little character,
minus tail except for a single broken feather. His behaviour was exactly
as though he had never been absent. His appetite was really amazing,
and as he was seen to be cariying small caterpillars, the obvious conclusion
was that he had in fact been nesting and was now feeding young ones.
Despite careful observation we have failed to find the nest. Judging by
Fred's appearance it must have been built in a very cramped situation.
There can now be little doubt that Fred should really be referred to as
Freda, but I am pretty certain that we shall continue to call " it " Fred.

Last year Donald and Betty Risdon went on a fairly comprehensive
safari in East Africa; they have recently returned from a second. After
both, they said they were sure that members would have greatly enjoyed
such an experience. During February this year they spent five days on a
luxury, tented safari run by friends. They were delighted with this and
were able to spend a lot of time, either on foot or in the Land Rover,
taking photographs or just watching birds, elephants, giraffes, lions,
buffalos, various antelopes, hippos, etc., at very close range. Later,
Betty Risdon stayed on to join a rhino-catching trip with Carr Hartley and

is sons, west of the Serengeti. The Hartleys are mainly concerned
nth the catching of animals that are becoming rare, for the Island of
Lubondo, in Lake Victoria. They were unlucky with rhino on this trip
s they had been poached in that area, but they did catch Roan and Topi,
t has occurred to the Risdons that some members of the Society might
ike the opportunity of going on a safari during the winter months. They
sel that anyone who has not yet been to East Africa should take the chance
f seeing some of the birds and animals in the wild before it is too late--
lready there are wide expanses that are bare of game. They are prepared
o arrange such a trip if sufficient support is forthcoming. Their experi-
nce has been that far more is to be seen at the leisurely pace of a tented
afari than rushing through the parks in a mini-bus to get to the lodges on
ime. Carr Hartley is willing to take out a party when they are catching
uimals, but he will not be available in November and December.
The Risdons have many transparencies of their trips which they would
&amp;gt;e pleased to show to anyone at Rode. They have prepared a question-
iaire, but the choice of type of safari, cost and time away would be up to
.ny members who might be interested. The suggested number for a
afari would be between 15 and 21. Members should get in touch with
he Risdons at the Tropical Bird Gardens, Rode, near Bath.

This is the second edition of a Dover publication which first appeared
n 1967. That was a revised republication of the work originally published
in 1958 by the American Committee for International Wildlife Protection
as Special Publication No. 13. It is reprinted by special arrangement
with that Committee.
The difficulty of preparing a list of this nature is exemplified in the
present edition, for six species which were thought to be extinct in 195^
have subsequently been found to be still in existence. On the other hand
in the same period one species and four subspecies have almost certainly
become extinct. The author has taken great care in bringing the informa-
tion up to date but obviously the position is constantly changing. The
Foreword by Jean Delacour, President-Emeritus of the International
Council for Bird Preservation stresses the threat to the existence of many
forms of wild life, and especially birds, resulting from the increase in

human population and the development of toxic substances for use in the
control of animal pests. There is also the gradual diminution in the area
of undeveloped parts of the earth's surface which often serve as refuges for
birds and other forms of life. Mr. Greenway has been faced with a
difficult task in preparing the list of vanishing birds but has restricted it to
those which are considered definitely and immediately threatened. The
author confines his list of extinct forms to those which have disappeared
within the past 280 years, comprising 42 species and 44 subspecies
known by their representative types in museums and with well documented
histories. There is also a list of birds known only from recent osseous
remains and finally a number of hypothetical forms known only by
pictures and the descriptions of travellers of long ago.
The fifth and longest list contains the names of small populations
which because of special circumstances connected with human inter-
ference are considered to be in danger of extinction. Finally there are
notes on some rare birds probably not in immediate danger.
There is an interesting chapter on the geography of extinction with
the rather surprising information that there is no account of extinction of
any species of birds on the continent of Europe with the exception of
Ostriches and the Great Auk. The area-by-area survey of important lost
and disappearing birds serves as a warning about the steps to be taken to
prevent the total disappearance of threatened species.
The main part of the book, however, is devoted to a discussion of each
species and subspecies, with detailed information on nomenclature, last
sightings, range, description, habits and similar material, including 86
text-figures of birds and a coloured cover illustration of two Cyanoramphus
parrots and the Dodo (Raphus cucullatus ), by D. M. Reid Henry. There
is also a bibliography of 47 pages.
The book can be thoroughly recommended to all interested in
ornithology, and especially bird preservation. E. H.

'STIMULITE' NECTAR FOOD is a COMPLETE NUTRI-
TIONAL food in highly concentrated form. It is highly
beneficial to all livestock, whether it be Humming Birds,
Sun Birds or other Nectarines, Insectivorous Birds, Fruit-
eaters, Canaries, Finches, Parrakeets, Parrots, or any kind
of animal. This supreme food should be available to
them at all times.
Recently there has been some advocacy of a sugar and protein diet for
Humming Birds, such a diet is very deficient in nutritional value.
PROTEIN is produced within the body by METABOLISM from the
nutrients in the food consumed. A diet, to be fully nutritional, has to
contain all the essential vitamins, A, D, E, C, and the full vitamin B
Complex, Bl, B2, B6, B12 (known as the animal-protein factor), the full
context contains Thiamin, Riboflavine, Nicotinic Acid, Pantothenic Acid,
Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Inositol, Choline and Biotin. Only a food
containing all of these can be termed COMPLETE.
Metabolism can only convert the food into protein if the food also
contains the following amino acids : Arginine, Histidine, Lysine,
Trypotophane, Phenylalanine, Methionine, Leucine, Isoleucine and
Valine. All these factors are necessary for a fully nutritional food, they
are not hearsay, but SCIENTIFIC FACTS which can be verified.

by Bates &amp; Busenbark. 88/- Post Paid.
373 pages, 63 pages of coloured photographs of parrots plus 26 pages in
colour on budgerigars. This book must be considered to be the finest
reference work available to the parrot fancier today. The book not only
identifies and provides you with all the necessary data about the many
birds and related species, but it also guides you through all the stages
of parrot care, feeding and breeding, from the selection of the cage down to
commercial breeding. There are hundreds of black and white and true
colour photographs of almost all known varieties from the budgerigar
to the unusual and exotic parrots of Africa, S. America, Australia, the
Philippines, India and the Pacific Islands.
The authors discuss the special characteristics of each species and
advise on special requirements if these are needed.
The authors are America's foremost authorities on parrots and they
have at their Palos Verdes Bird Farm for more than twenty years reared
these birds and have bred many birds which previously had never been
bred in captivity.

THE BRONZE-WINGED MANNIKIN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979007" page_id="58089236"  page_num="213" year="" vol="">
{Spermestes cucullatus)
By C. J. O. Harrison (Perivale, Middlesex, England)
The Bronze-winged Mannikin, Spermestes cucullatus , is a small African
mannikin widely distributed over most of that continent south of the
Sahara. It occurs in large flocks and is imported as a cagebird in relatively
large numbers, its low price and relatively dull colouring making it of little
account to most aviculturists. The genus Spermestes has only four (or
three) species, the larger and big-billed Magpie Mannikin, Spermestes
fringilloideSy the black-backed Black and White Mannikin, S. poensis and
the chestnut-backed Rufous-backed Mannikin, S. nignceps , being the
other members of it. The last two, one in the central Congo Basin region
and the other in the east, are often regarded as two forms of a single species.
They are similar in size to the Bronze-winged Mannikin but prefer wood-
land or the vicinity of water rather than open grassland. All these species
are characterised by green or blue gloss on parts of the plumage but other-
wise seem to differ little from the typical mannikins ( Lonchura species)
with which they are often grouped by taxonomists, save that the Bronze-
winged Mannikin at least has a special posture during squabbles, raising
the wing that is furthest from the other bird high above its back like a
banner.
The Bronze-winged Mannikins are grassland birds, feeding on seed
taken from the grasses themselves or from the ground. They are highly
sociable, rarely seen alone, and usually occur in large flocks where grasses
or millet crops are ripe. In the wilds breeding is linked with the rainy
season and they may have several broods a year. This control of breeding
by the availability of water enables them to breed at almost any time of
year in captivity; and in the possession of this controlling factor they
resemble the Budgerigar and Zebra Finch which also show a prolonged
breeding season in aviaries. In spite of their strong sociable tendencies
these little mannikins are relatively aggressive, tending to squabble fre-
quently among themselves; and this may make them a nuisance if they are
kept with other birds such as smaller waxbills or less aggressive seed-eaters.
They nest readily, taking to a variety of sites. When not nesting they
build a communal roosting nest which as many as can will squeeze into at
nightfall. Desmond Morris, who made a detailed study of the behaviour
of this species ( Behaviour n (1957); 156-201), pointed out that unless a

they were liable to find that their nest had become a communal roost site by
dusk. Once a whole flock has paired up and started to nest the birds sleep
in their own nests. They may build very close to one another and at times
clustered nests have been recorded. They are not above utilising old
weaver bird nests in the wilds, a habit which they share with a number of
widely diverse African species, including starlings and lovebirds. They
also show the curious habit of nesting at times in close association with
wasps or hornets. This is usually cited as an example of recognition of
the protective value of the latter, but I sometimes wonder whether it might
not be that the wasps' nest, as a lump in a bush, suggests the beginnings of
a waxbill's nest and the likelihood that this is a potentially suitable site, and
so triggers off in the more sociable species the already present urge to build.
As in most of these species the young are unlike the adults, having a dull
brown plumage and a dark bill lacking the distinctive white of the lower
mandible of the adults. In the absence of such specific markings the
antagonism of the adults is not aroused and the young birds may move
about freely, usually sleeping at night in the parental nest. They mature
rapidly, and are ready to breed within a few months.

THE BREEDING OF RED LORIES AT PAIGNTON
ZOO
(Eos horned)

Our pair of Red Lories was received by the Zoo in December 1966 and
immediately placed in a cage in the Parrot House. This particular cage
was remarkably small for breeding quarters, measuring only 58m. high by
37m. deep by 67m. wide, and it came as a surprise to everybody when
first of all two eggs were laid and later two fine chicks reared.
The nest-box provided was of normal design for smaller Parrakeets and
Lories measuring i6in. high by ioin. wide by 6in. deep with the entrance
hole, which was 4jin. square, in the top left hand corner. This was
placed in the cage in the April of 1967 at the highest possible point.
Little or no interest was shown in the nest-box at all until September,
when both of the birds began to disappear into the box for hours upon end,
but it was not until December, however, that it became apparent that there
was something present in it. Upon inspection it was found to contain two
eggs, which were difficult to see distinctly because of the position of the
box in relation to the roof of the cage. Because of the small size of the
cage, and the great risk of disturbing the birds, the eggs were not checked
at all to find out the date of hatching.

The first sign we had that the eggs had possibly hatched was when the
Female was seen frequently coming out of the box to feed. This was at the
md of December 1967. By the end of the first week in January 1968 our
suspicions were confirmed when a shrill squeaking was heard coming from
:he box while the female was feeding. By this time the male was also
visiting the nest-box after having fed, presumably to feed the youngsters.
We did not know for sure until the 17th January that we did, in fact, have
:wo chicks, because the nest-box had not been checked since the middle of
December, for the aforementioned reasons. The diet provided for these
firds was not changed for the chicks as it was already a comprehensive
me. (Diet sheet is shown at the end of this article.)
The first youngster left the nest-box on the 19th February approxi-
mately seven weeks after hatching. At this time the second youngster had
itill to finish feathering on its breast, but this was soon completed and it,
n turn, left the box on the 3rd March, about nine weeks after hatching.
The young birds differed from their parents, being a much duller red,
laving black beaks instead of mellow orange ones and black wing flashes
nstead of blue. At the time of writing, which is seven months after
latching, the young birds have still not developed the blue wing flashes, or
he bright scarlet plumage, but their beaks have toned to the same colour
is their parents. Also at this time the four birds are still kept together,
lut preparations are now under way to remove the youngsters to an
idjacent cage.

(Certhia familiar is)
By F. Meaden (Cheshunt, Herts., England)
Three Treecreepers, Certhia familiaris, sexed on bill-length as a male
and two females, were given me by an old friend now deceased. They are
thought, originally, to have been rescued from a badly disturbed nest and
would now be in their fifth year. During the last winter they were kept in
a birdroom in a large cage which had the back and ends lined with natural
bark. The birdroom was warmed, the temperature ranging from 60 to
F. gradually being dropped to that which prevailed outdoors in March.
In April they were transferred to an outdoor flight 8ft. long x 4ft. wide
x 6ft. high. This adjoins the birdroom which shelters one side of it, the
roof overhanging the aviary by a distance of one foot. At the back of the
flight is a woven wattle fence, and the remainder of it is of wire. The
front has a feeding hatch about three feet from the ground, giving access to
a small shelf protected from the weather by a hood. Slabs of bark are
fixed against the inside of the flight along the birdroom side and at the end,
and along the top of the aviary about five inches below the birdroom over-
hang, a barked-covered shelf is fixed, projecting from the wall at an angle
of about 45 degrees.
The birds are fed on fresh daily supplies of Avi-vite, and finely chopped
green food; while twice daily grated cheese and maggots powdered with 8
yeast preparation are provided. The latter we obtain while small and
fatten on a special diet. A multivitamin concentrate is given once weekl)
on the maggots, and on this occasion the yeast is omitted. Greater Wax-
moth larvae are a favourite food and when available in quantity are giver
freely. One daily item of which these birds seem to partake as freely a;
anything else is " Farex " baby food mixed with milk.
In the flight, the birds selected individual roostsites in hollows in the
bark at widely separated points in the aviary. When not active they ofter
rested in the narrow space between the shelf and the roof, retiring then
also in bad weather. They shared the flight with one male and two femalt
Long-tailed Tits, Aegithalos caudatus, and a pair of Wrens, T. troglodytes
the three species being kept together because of their similar feeding
requirements. Nesting had not been anticipated in the aviary, but durinj
the latter part of April one of the females was seen carrying dry grass ant
fine hair to a site behind the high shelf at the end nearer the back of th
flight. There was no definite evidence of nesting, but the birds hat
various places where they could conceal themselves and tended to kee]
still and become more difficult to locate when not active.
On 18th and 19th of May, a female was seen carrying a wax-moth larv
to and fro, but not swallowing it. Although a watch was kept the bin
made no effort to visit the site while under observation and there was n
sound of young birds. On 25th May, nestlings were heard for the firs

ime from a distance, but when anyone approached the aviary the birds
mmediately became quiet, probably silenced by the parents, although no
varning had been heard. The secretiveness of the birds dashed any hopes
)f discovering what role the second female played in all this. Certainly
he other two were not aggressive towards her. On 2nd June, from midday
mwards, an intermittent watch was kept to try to establish if the second
emale was also feeding the young, but in fact the three adults rested in
lifferent parts of the flight and showed very little activity. There seemed
10 evidence of birds visiting the nest and nothing was heard of the young.
It was thought that they had died and so, at 8 p.m. the nest-site was
nvestigated.
To my surprise, several fully-feathered young scattered from it in all
lirections, running like spiders along the bark, while the parents dashed
iround calling loudly. The fouled nest contained three dried and
lattened young stuck to the nest-cup, and from the size of the feet I
estimated these to have died at 2-3 days old. The nest was lined with
;rass (no moss being used although this was available), the outer coarse
itructure being old dried fine strips of skin (bark) from honeysuckle
tranches growing in their flight, wood shavings (some about 4m. x |in. x
{ \in.), feathers, and a little fine white dog-hair and cotton wool.
The three young that had emerged were quite tame when handled, but
vhen in the flight were made more alarmed by the nervous behaviour of
he parents.
At this period, the Wrens had also built a nest in a low nest-box and laid,
ind the Long-tailed Tits were showing signs of activity. After about a
veek, it would appear that fighting broke out as a hen Wren and the two
len Tits were found dead, all within two days, severely pecked about the
lead.
It is not certain what had happened and the birds were not seen to
lisagree.
The Treecreepers had always been most amicable towards other birds,
)ut since this occurred when the young ones were moving a little uncertainly
ibout the flight, there is some reason to suspect that they might have been
nvolved.
It was felt to be necessary to catch up the other two odd male birds and
0 remove them. While this was being done, the young Treecreepers were
ilso caught up and separated from the adults for several hours, during
vhich time attempts were made to hand-feed them, after the usual initial
orcing and upon becoming hungry, they gaped readily. They were,
lowever, restored to the parents who continued to care for them, but this
nomentary association with human beings had a sequel when, after the
r oung had been out of the nest about a fortnight, the parents ceased to feed
hem. The young were well able to feed themselves now, but still
referred to beg, and when anyone approached the flight, the youngsters
vould run about like small mice on the wire just in front of the visitor's face

pushing their bills through and squeaking to be fed. At this period it was
found that they were very reluctant to descend for food even though the
parents did so, but would happily take it at a higher level, from a ledge or
when adhering to the wire. This is probably correlated with the fact that
in the wild, young Treecreepers newly emerged from the nest are less
agile on the wing than the adults and tend to keep well up in the trees where
they are out of harm's way and less likely to be grounded in a flight from
one tree to another.
All three young have been reared to maturity, although one of them
recently discovered a tiny aperture in the structure of the flight door and
opted for total independence.
As described, F. Meaden has bred the Treecreeper (Certhia familiaris).
It is believed that this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species in
Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at once
with the Hon. Secretary.

BREEDING THE CRIMSON-BACKED TANAGER
(Rhamphocelus dimidiatus )
By Herbert Murray (Brentwood, Essex, England)
The Crimson-Backed Tanager (Rhamphocelus dimidiatus is in my

opinion, one of the loveliest of all birds. It is a close relative of the Silver-
Beaked Tanager, (or Maroon Tanager as it is more generally known).
The coloration of the cock is a lovely dark crimson and black, and the hen
is similar but duller. The cock has a bright silver patch on his beak, and
the hen has a similar patch but much duller. These patches are not
visible in young birds.
Some years ago I imported a few of these birds from Colombia, and they
were in very beautiful condition when they arrived. I kept two for myself
which at the time I was pretty sure were a pair, but although they always
looked different I feel quite sure now were two cocks.
I kept these birds for some time, but they were rather spiteful and I got
rid of them. Last year Mr. L. R. Cousins of Manor Park told me that he
still had the pair that he had had from me. He was sure that they were a
true pair, but he could not get them to nest successfully, and would I like
to have another try? I agreed, and when the birds came down they were
very fit and were soon bosses of the large aviary into which they were put.
I suspect them of murder, but cannot be sure.
These birds are the swiftest thing that I have ever known, and they can
fly so fast that they appear to be a scarlet flash. They went to nest at once
and built a flimsy nest in gorse. The nest was built of dried strips of bark
pulled off perches. The eggs, two in number, were a very bright blue with

eddish brown markings. They hatched in 14 days, but the parents would
eed nothing other than mealworms, and after about a week the young
vere thrown out and the whole business started all over again. I suspect
jut cannot be sure that the young were alive when thrown out. I think
:he cock did this.
I had five nests from these birds in 1967, but did not succeed in rearing a
jingle young one. This was a great disappointment apart from being a
inancial disaster as the quantity of mealworms they consumed was
mmense.
After thinking over the matter during the winter I decided that in 1968
[ would try to breed them in a small individual aviary and so, when the
spring arrived, I put the birds in a summer aviary intending that, if the
birds bred I would separate the cock. The aviary was nice and secluded,
about 8ft. by 4ft. and about 7ft. high. The birds, however, like all my
birds, had different ideas, refused to build a nest, and laid their eggs off the
perches. So in desperation I put them back in their large flight--albeit
with some trepidation--and they went to nest at once, and in due course
one youngster flew. It was a nice strong little fellow, but he got caught in
one of the terrific rainstorms of the summer and disappeared.
By this time I was getting a bit tired of trying to breed these birds, but
they went to nest again, and again a young one flew. In spite of constant
danger from storms I managed to rear him and he is now quite self-suppor-
ting, although even after six weeks flying and with further young in the
nest the old birds will still sometimes feed him. Like all the other
Tanagers I have bred, there is no attempt to drive him away. The cock
bird is a lot quieter this year, and this seems to help a lot, but the parents
are so shy and active, that I have never seen the hen bird on the nest.
As I said before, these are most beautiful active, and self reliant birds
and the best way of breeding them would undoubtedly be the semi-freedom
principle, but here again it would not be easy to get them to nest in a small
aviary before giving them their liberty.
The only call I have ever heard them give is a very sparrow-like chirp.
They have a habit of stropping their beaks for a number of times before
feeding the young, but this is not done very regularly.
Careful observation of the behaviour of the young of the first brood to
the second brood shows that the younger birds are fed and looked after by
the birds from earlier broods even more carefully than by the parents.
The young are fed and preened, and any frightening of the young is
accompanied by protests from the earlier hatched birds.
In view of the intolerance of Tanagers for adult birds of the same race, it
is rather strange that they make no attempt to drive the young away, but I
make the following suggestion which may provide a possible answer.
Large Tanagers seem to have an extended breeding season, over here
usually from April until September, but these birds always have small
broods. The size of the average clutch is two eggs, and only occasionally
are three eggs found in a clutch.

S. B. KENDALL--AVIARY HYGIENE
As brood follows brood rapidly, and as the young are fed for a month to
six weeks after flying, this feeding behaviour of the older birds would
greatly assist the parents.
When the breeding season is over the young birds remain with their
parents for the winter, and indeed in their native haunts may easily flock
like finches do here. In the spring fighting starts for mates and territory,
and the birds usually have to be separated by February or March.
As described, Herbert Murray has bred the Crimson-backed Tanager
(Rhamphocelus dimidiatus). It is believed this may be a first success.

By S. B. Kendall (Chertsey, Surrey, England)
Our Secretary has asked me to supply a note on the after-treatment of
aviaries that have contained birds suffering from infectious or contagious
disease. An initial brief word on avoiding infection and limiting its spread
seems appropriate.
New birds are of course the danger and the more you buy the more risk
you run. The golden rule is to quarantine every new arrival, regardless of
its origin, and it is best for each to be confined in a separate cage. I use all-
wire cages made quite simply and cheaply of welded mesh, supported on
angle iron over a concrete floor covered with newspaper which can be
folded up each day and burnt. Feed and water the new arrivals after the
rest of your stock and don't interchange equipment. With established
stock remember that young birds are much more susceptible to disease
than are adults and that the best way of limiting trouble from disease is to
keep the family unit together as a group: the best way of promoting an
epidemic is to aggregate successive groups of young birds throughout the
season.
Measures to avoid infection, limit disease and to make premises safe after
disease will obviously vary greatly according to the circumstances and the
disease organisms that have caused the trouble. For example, a virus, as
recent experience with foot and mouth disease has shown, may readily be
transmitted from one set of premises to another, even by the wind. But
on the other hand most viruses under normal conditions are delicate organ-
isms which are readily destroyed by ordinary environmental conditions--
particularly direct sunshine. Infected animals may be excreting enormous
amounts of virus and this can be disseminated far and wide, but once the
source of infection (the live animal) has been removed the danger rapidly
decreases.

By contrast, some organisms spread only with difficulty, but may remain
alive for a very long time. Some may have complicated life-histories with
a dependence on a vector--an insect for example--which may need to be
of a particular species. If this is confined to the particular tropical
country from which the bird derives there is no danger at all of spread
from the individual or group of individuals involved in an outbreak of
disease soon after importation. Many parasites have specially resistant
stages of development. Thus the coccidia have resistant spores which
under average conditions will survive for weeks and which under ideal
conditions may survive very much longer. Sometimes the parasite adopts
more sophisticated means of ensuring survival. Thus Histomonas (the
" Blackhead " organism) which is extremely delicate, survives in the egg of
the caecal worm and this in turn (like the Gape-worm) can live and be
carried around by earth-worms.
Clearly the measures to be taken to control an outbreak of virus disease
in a pheasantry will be very different from those necessary to control
blackhead.
Some broad principles of disease control may nevertheless be suggested.
Aviaries with earth floors are really impossible to free from infective
agents except by destocking, the length of time for which they should
remain vacant varying greatly with the infective agent. Under experi-
mental conditions organisms with resistant stages can survive for a year or
more but there is usually a steep decline in viability after the first three
weeks or so particularly under dry conditions. Obviously a practical
compromise has to be accepted. A month's rest will do a great deal of
good and three months will make it essentially as safe as it ever was.
Most modern epidemiologists regard absolute freedom from infection as
unrealistic. With most diseases the object is to limit the amount of
infection rather than totally avoid it. In practice a system whereby birds
are wintered on concrete or other readily cleaned floors and summered on
grass has a lot to recommend it.
If serious disease has occurred in a grass flight the use of a flame-gun to
remove surface vegetation and general debris (Mind the wire!) gives the
soil a chance to dry out and dryness is death to most disease organisms.
Even the hottest flame has, however, a very superficial effect for soil has
excellent insulating properties. Flaming merely accelerates a natural
process. After the top soil has dried, turning it over and liming also
accelerate the natural processes which make it safe. Making an aviary
shelter or aviary with a solid floor safe for further stocking is much easier.
Remove all dirt and debris first and then use plenty of water and detergent.
Allow to dry out completely (a week or more) before restocking.
It will be noticed that so far I have said nothing about disinfectants.
Under some circumstances chemical substances may have a special use--
viruses are often very susceptible to changes in pH so washing soda in the
water is effective, hypochlorite (bleach) is a good general disinfectant and

ammonia solution has a specific effect against the spores of coccidia, but all
these substances are effective only when they can get in contact with the
organism, i.e. when surfaces are already clean. They may add to the effect
produced by ordinary cleaning but it is no more than this. Slopping
disinfectant about as a substitute for cleaning is strongly to be dis-
couraged. Use of disinfectants on earth floors is usually a waste of time.
Special considerations apply to ornithosis (psittacosis)--a subject which
tends to evoke an emotional response from parrot keepers. While serious
disease is comparatively rare it must be accepted that the organism can be
dangerous to man and it behoves us all to treat it with respect.
If ornithosis has been confirmed the implication is that professional
advice is available. It should be taken.
As regards the infected aviary, it is important to realize that there is
likely to be a heavy contamination with the infective organism, but that in
the absence of birds it will not last very long. Shut the doors and windows
of the aviary shelter and leave the aviary alone for a week or ten days. It
is possible to hasten the destruction of the organism by formalin fumigation
but time will produce the same result. After at least a week open every-
thing up, first spray some water about to settle the dust and then clean out,
avoiding personal contamination, including inhalation, as far as possible.
If a bird has died in a cage, put the cage in the garden on the compost heap,
hose it down and leave it outside to weather for a week before a proper
clean and polish.
With nearly all disease, dilution of the infective agent is the important
thing and this is accomplished by plenty of water and fresh air.
A final word about a gloomy subject--if birds did not have a considerable
natural resistance to their specific pathogens there would be very few left
alive. We can enormously help those that are in our care by sensible
stock management--good food, as much space as possible and protection
from unreasonable climatic stress.

The Sun-Bittern is a member of the order Gruiformes which contains
eleven varied living families, seven of which contain three species or less
and two families which are known to science only as fossils. Although the
members of the Order look unrelated externally (it includes such diversified
birds as cranes, hemipodes (quail-like birds), Limpkin (Ibis-like) and
Kagu (stork-like) but, on examination of internal structure, one finds
skeletal and muscular affinities. Their closest relatives outside the Order
appear to be the Galliformes (fowl-like birds) and Charadriiformes (shore-
birds, gulls and auks) and are thus classified between these two orders.

SUN-BITTERN DISPLAY

We have three specimens of this bird in the large aviary in the centre of
the Bird House at London Zoo at the present, as this aviary contains two
large ponds--a necessary thing as in the wild Sun-Bitterns like to walk
slowly in shallow water and feed like herons by staring into the w r ater and
suddenly thrusting the bill into it. Although the water in the aviary
contains no food (apart from the strips of meat the birds themselves take
from the food tin and dunk before consuming it), they appear to enjoy
wading. When displaying, the wings and tail are opened, the rear edges
of wings being raised thus revealing the full pattern and colour to the mate.
This attitude is also adopted when threatening other birds and is accom-
panied by a harsh rattling cry. The birds spend much time walking
sedately around the aviary, uttering a long-drawn whistle (which may be
very soft) which is sometimes followed by a rattle, though less harsh than
that used in aggression. They will also spend some time standing
motionless with head resting between shoulders, like a Heron. This bird
adopts a strange, erratic attitude in which it will run up and
down quickly while flicking wings and turning round and round, and I
have seen this take place for no apparent reason. I have often seen it
standing with just body swaying from side to side--probably for the same
reason that bitterns extend their necks and sway to render them less
conspicuous among the swaying reeds (although in the case of Sun-
Bitterns the neck is not always extended and the body is never held
vertically as bitterns do). In the wild they thrive on minnows, insects, etc.,
but in the Zoo we give them minced meat together with an insect mixture
and also maggots, mealworms, house flies and locusts.

The nest is situated in a tree or bush (though there are records of them
also nesting on the ground) and is a globular structure made of decaying
leaves, stems and green leaves in which two oval eggs are laid, these being
clay-coloured or buffish with darker spots and blotches.
During the year 1865 there was a long continuance of hot and dry
weather during the Summer and Autumn, and Mr. A. D. Bartlett, who was
the Superintendent of the Zoological Society's gardens at that time, wrote
in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society for 1866 that he felt this had
much to do with the influence on breeding and the tendency to breed of
animals that had not previously done so.
Bartlett noted that the pair of Sun-Bitterns that were purchased in
September 1862 had begun to show signs of breeding early in May, e.g.
carrying about bits of sticks, roots of grass, etc. and were consistently
walking round the pond searching for nesting materials; they also tried to
mix wet dirt with moss, etc., so they were supplied with wet clay and mud.
After a short time they settled to make a nest on the top of a tree 10 ft*
from the ground, on which was fixed an old straw nest. Both birds carried
up mud and clay mixed with straw, roots, etc. and the sides of the nest
were raised and plastered inside with mud. One morning a few fragments
of a broken egg were found below the tree which may have been from this
bird but as there was a Blue Waterhen in the same aviary it was probable
that it could have been from this species; so this bird was removed from the
aviary. In the early part of June the female had laid an egg in the nest
which resembled that of a Moorhen or Woodcock. Both birds incubated
the egg and the young bird took 27 days to hatch. It was a very attractive
chick being thickly covered with fine short tufts of down and bore resem-
blance to a young plover or snipe though the head and body was covered
with somewhat longer hair than is to be found in the aforementioned
species. The chick remained in the nest, being fed regularly by both
parents on small live fish as well as a few insects, etc. It had a rather
peculiar method of taking its food, for instead of gaping or calling like
most nestlings it would snap or peck the morsel from the parent's bill as
soon as it alighted upon the nest and swallowed it at once. At 21 days the
wings were sufficiently developed to enable it to fly to the ground, where it
was fed as before and never again returned to the nest. It grew very
quickly and within two months was indistinguishable from its parents.
Early in August the parents began repairing the nest, adding a fresh lining
of mud and clay, and at the end of August another egg was laid. I his
time the male appeared to do the incubation with much greater care than
the female, who continued to feed the now nearly full-grown young one;
the second youngster hatched on the 28th September. Both parents were
seen feeding the first more frequently than the second youngster so the
second young one was hand-reared by the Keeper though it was left in the
nest and they both reached maturity.

The eggs of this species differ remarkably from those of the true herons, in-
asmuch that they are spotted and blotched whereas heron's eggs are unmarked
except for damp stains caused by the vegetation; thus they resemble more
closely those of plovers and snipes, but the young differ in the fact that they
remain in the nest whereas in the plovers and snipes they run about as soon
as they are hatched, or a few hours afterwards.
It has also been bred in Bronx Park, Frankfurt and Rio de Janeiro.
It is an inhabitant of central and northern South America and there are
three races.

The founders of the present colony were purchased in 1957. The
exact number is not known to the writer, but probably consisted of three
pairs. They have always been housed in the same aviary and regularly
nested and produced young. Quite a number of birds have been sold and
a few have died, but by the Summer of 1967 the flock numbered approxi-
mately 40 birds with an unknown number of eggs and young in the nest.
After much consultation it was decided to try the experiment of releasing
the birds to form a free flying flock of homing parakeets. The one diffi-
culty which had been pointed out by various Zoo Directors was that free
flying Quaker Parrakeets had done great damage to fruit orchards in the
vicinity of the home nest. However, as Paignton Zoo is itself heavily
wooded and surrounded by forest areas we felt that any damage would be
local and so spread out among the thousands of trees and shrubs in
Paignton Zoo, Clennon Gorge, Primley Woods, etc. as to be hardly
noticed, and so in early August when many young birds were in the nest a
panel of wire mesh was removed from the top of their Aviary and the birds
allowed to escape at their leisure.
The Quakers took quite some time before they realised that the way was
open to the outside world and spent about an hour inspecting the hole and
peering in all directions before the first bird plucked up enough courage to
fly out. Other birds soon followed its example and by late afternoon
nearly all the adults had left the aviary for short flights, returning every
few minutes. From then on the birds began to fly farther and farther
afield, until now they are often seen up to two miles away.

210 MRS. P. SHEPHERD--NOTES ON BREEDING THE QUAKER PARRAKEET
The Quakers always fly in small flocks of six or eight birds together, and
it would seem that, because of this, native British birds are discouraged
from mobbing them, for not once has an incident of this sort been reported.
Before the birds were released a yearly event was the destruction in the
the Spring of the old nest before a new one was started. This, despite the
fact that plenty of fresh twigs were placed in the Aviary. This year, with
the birds able to choose just the material that they require, the pattern of
behaviour has changed, and work on enlarging the old nest and the
building of new ones has gone on without pause. There are now three
large nests in the Aviary and one outside in an overhanging tree. The
three nests inside the Aviary now all contain eggs and young birds.
One interesting feature of this Aviary is the way in which it has been
used by British wild birds, Goldfinches, Greenfinches, Blackbirds, Bull-
finches, finding it a convenient source of food, and a pair of Blue-tits have
just raised two young, presumably in one of the Parakeets nest holes.
We cannot be sure if we have suffered any losses, but as twenty to thirty
birds are often seen at one time in and around the Aviary, it would seem as
if losses, if any, have been very small.
From our point of view the experiment has been a great success and the
visitors enjoyment has been much enhanced by seeing these industrious
little birds hard at work bringing in their twigs from all parts of the Zoo.

In 1967 we brought two pairs of Quaker Parrakeets, Myiopsitta
monarchus, housing them in a large aviary partly roofed with translucent
corrugated plastic, and with a small roosting shelter. The birds never used
the latter but one pair used the entrance hole as a base for a nest. The
nest was cup-shaped and gradually built upwards and outwards to meet the
roof, after which twigs were woven into the roof netting and around the
sides to form a tunnel with an entrance that extended downwards slightly
to give a final length of about three feet. About halfway through building
we considered it advisable to support the structure with a piece of weld-
mesh underneath it. The second pair started a smaller nest alongside.
We live up in the Blackdown Hills where the winters can be quite severe,
but the birds stayed out all last winter, roosting in their nests, through
severe frost and snow (up to 12 inches), staying active and cheerful and
playing about happily in the snow. They were fed on 5 */ 5 * budgie seed
mixture and some sunflower seed. They were always provided with
large bundles of fresh cut birch and willow branches which they enjoy

eating, consuming both leaves and bark reducing them to nothing within
a matter of hours.
In May we unfortunately lost one hen, and in late May the other was not
to be seen and we hoped for the best. Both pairs had been seen mating
and we knew that it was a hen that had been lost. The other sat for about
three weeks. After about two and a half weeks we began supplying green-
food and apple ad. lib., (they ate perpetual spinach, lettuce, young dande-
lion, masses of chickweed, and at least one whole sweet apple per day).
We did not disturb them and the nest could only be inspected with the aid
of a small mirror on a stick by which means we thought we could see three
chicks, but were delighted about three weeks later to see seven green and
grey heads up the tunnel when the parents were out. The young left the
nest after about a further ten days. They would all play together, pulling
tails and chasing one another. The lone cock was a little aggressive
towards them but they were protected by the parents and learned to avoid
him and his nest. We have long-suffering neighbours, but in view of the
noisiness of the birds we decided to dispose of all but one of the young
which we hope will be a hen.

By T. S. Thomson (Hoole, Chester, England)
Numerically results were well below average, exceptionally heavy rain
causing some losses of newly-hatched young, while vandalism by boys
caused loss of liberty Budgerigars, and of eggs from aviaries, with some
mixing of birds. 31,000 sq. feet of aviary was in use with about 1,000
resting, breeding pairs having, on average, 200 sq. ft. per pair. Two
Emperor Geese were reared but fertile Chiloe Wigeon and Mandarin eggs
were stolen. Blue-eared, Elliott's, Swinhoe's, and Amherst Pheasants,
Red-legged Partridge and some Quail all produced young.
A Monal x Amherst hybrid was reared, the cock Monal gained access
to an Amherst trio when a door was blown open and the hybrid remained
an-noticed until the poults were a few weeks old. It was reared on turkey
crumbs. The hybrid is an interesting bird. It has the Monal sway when
running and also its father's digging action. The tail is short and fanned
cut in Monal fashion. It also has the Monal characteristic of standing in
an upright position ready to strike, and has the natural curiosity and fear-
less disposition of the breed. The bill is heavy and curved. There is a
circle of light green around the eye and the spangling is darker and finer
:han on the Amhersts hatched with it. There is no sign of a crest but
spur-points are visible about halfway up the yellowish legs. It cheeps
like a young Amherst.
Zebra Doves made several nests and reared two young in different nests.
White Barbary Doves reared two young. Yellow-billed Peru Doves, the
cen of which was one of two reared in 1967, had two nests but continually

left when anyone approached within 50 feet. Since hundreds of visitors
passed through a nearby aviary there was no chance of success and the
eggs were put under Barbary Doves but were crushed.
Cinnamon and lutino Greenfinches, Chaffinches, Bullfinches, and
Goldfinches bred, the last two from northern British x stock. Bramblings
had two nests, the young of the first being lost through parental neglect and
the second brood reared by fostering on Greenfinches.
Blue Tits were bred by controlled liberty methods, the parents being
allowed to find their own food. The large aviaries supplied adequate live
food for some species; no special provision being made for Hedge-
Sparrows which also bred, their aviary having an 80,000 cu. ft. capacity
and including 18 30 -year-old fruit trees pruned back to 12ft. high and
a mass of plum suckers that attract live food of various kinds. T. he
Hedge Sparrows take plate millet all the year round. Song I hrushes
reared a first round without extra live food, but it was offered when the
second round hatched since Starlings were feeding young in the same aviary.
A single 1967 Song Thrush built and laid two clutches, two eggs being
replaced by fertile ones and the young reared for ten days before being
thrown out of the nest. A pair of Blackbirds reared their first brood in an
aviary and after it was opened returned to raise another round in the open
unit.
A pair of Melba Finches, housed alone in a 50 ft. x 7 ft. aviary with
12 ft. shelter hatched young which disappeared at two days, and Pekin
Robins in a 40 ft. x 50 ft. aviary never progressed beyond carrying
material. Purple-headed Glossy Starlings, Cordon Bleus, Fire Finches,
Zebra Finches, and Indian Silverbills bred at liberty, the unique method
of liberation having a bearing on success. The established flock of
liberty Zebras more than doubled and there was an increase in the Silver-
bills. Of three pairs each of Cordon Bleus and Fire Finches a pair of each
brought home four and three young respectively, while a nest of young
Fire Finches was washed out in a storm. Three adult Cordon Bleus and
four Fire Finches went missing after a few weeks, as did one of two
Lavender Finches also liberated. The liberty system contributed to the
successful rearing of three Purple-headed Glossy Starlings. At three
months old the young have dark eyes and the plumage, unlike that of the
young of our native species, is glossy.
Two White-crested Jay-thrushes, at liberty all winter, but roosting in
their aviary, moved to the garden of a friend half a mile away where they
have spent the summer without returning, being fed there twice a day.
Approximately 150 birds are at controlled liberty, about half being
Budgerigars which have nested in the open garden for several years.
Observation on the reproduction of various British bird species under
various conditions and diets has added further data to that accumulated
over past years, with ample evidence that feeding is the critical factor in
the successful reproduction of most species.

(Bubo africanus)
By Owen D. Long (Salisbury, Rhodesia)
The first pair of these birds which came my way were found wandering
an the Salisbury Kopje in November, 1961 by two young Indian boys who
*ave them to D. M. Reid-Henry, who in turn gave them to me. I would
lave guessed their age to have been about four to five weeks. At this stage
Ley were fed mainly on rats and mice, of which there was an adequate
supply, but partly on ox heart and shin.
In the following August, I noticed that the female had suddenly gone
aroody, and not wishing to upset her I left her alone until I decided that
something should have happened, and when I put my hand under her I
found that she had been incubating a stone.
The following year, the original male made good his escape, and was
replaced by another, and in August the first two eggs were laid. These
proved to be fertile, but due to some disturbance (I think), as the eggs
shipped, so they were eaten. The same thing happened again in 1964 and
1965, and in these three years the female laid a total of thirteen eggs, all of
which were fertile.
Up to this time my neighbour had kept about 200 hens, and in con-
sequence had maintained a large rat population, so much so that I was able
to buy rats from the African who tended his chickens at a penny per animal,
and there was never a real shortage of food. However, in 1965 my
neighbour decided to give up his chickens, and although I had a bumper
crop of rats when the buildings were demolished they were the last I was to
see from this source. In consequence, for the last two years this pair of
Owls had has nothing but ox heart, with the exception of one rat, one
mouse, one dead kitten (killed by dogs) and a three week old guinea fowl
chick which found its way into their aviary.
The first egg was laid in 1966 on 30th July, and a further six followed,
all suffering the fate of previous clutches. The eighth egg this year had to
be removed surgically, due to lack of shell. What shell there was, was paper
thin and offered no resistance to the muscular efforts to eject it, and the
aid of the veterinary surgeon had to be sought.
It is normally agreed that in order to keep any bird in good condition it
must have food comparable with that which it finds in the wild, and with
birds of prey this is even more so in view of the apparent necessity to take
casting. It is said in some books on the subject that without this casting
the birds will deteriorate in condition, and presumably, eventually die,
and whilst I would not advocate that fur and feather are a thing of the past,
it is evident that in some cases at least, birds of prey can survive without it.
It seems that it is the fatty content of ordinary meat which does the damage,
and I therefore remove every possible trace of fat from the ox heart before
feeding it to the birds.

OWEN D. LONG--EXPERIENCES WITH SPOTTED EAGLE OWLS
It was therefore, with some satisfaction that on the ist August, this year
(1967), I was able to note that the first Owl egg was laid. Having nothing
better to offer, and remembering the last egg of 1966, I decided to sprinkle
all meat with shell grit, and although this was not much appreciated, it was
finally eaten, and on the 4th August, the second egg was laid. I have not
been able to find a reliable incubation period for this race, but I estimated
from the available date on Owls that it would be about 30 days. On 4th
September whilst putting food into the aviary I was delighted therefore to
witness the female feeding a chick which I would estimate to be 2 days old.
Whether this was the first or second egg, I am not quite sure, but I suspect
it was the second, because of the state of development of the chick, and
because upon inspection the shell of the egg which did not hatch was about
half the thickness that it should have been, and though it was fertile it
failed to hatch due to minute hair cracks which became visible upon
cleaning. Unfortunately no remains of the shell of the egg which did
hatch were found, but with the added shell grit, I am sure it must have
been thicker. This would therefore give an incubation period of 29 days
minimum and 31 days maximum. Ten days after the chick was first seen
it had increased in size to about three times its original. Sixteen days after
being first seen (21 Sept.), the chick was growing well, and in poor light
conditions it was noticed that some colour was becoming evident in the
region of its wings, but elsewhere the down was still sandy grey. It was
able to shuffle around the nesting cavity, but was not seen to stand other
than on its tarsi.
A week later it was standing up well and had a sharp look about it which
augured well for the future, however, on the following day it had dis-
appeared, and no trace of it has since been seen.
During the whole of its four week life it had nothing to eat other than ox
heart, doctored with Veterex and sprinkled with powdered bone meal.
Where it went to remains a mystery, though I have my own ideas on the
subject. On the tenth of October, the hen laid another egg, followed by a
partner two days later. These she incubated for ten days, and then for
some completely unknown reason, deserted. Both eggs were fertile.
Note:-- In 1968 the pattern has been repeated. The first clutch con-
tained three eggs, two of which disappeared after a fortnight, and the
remaining one hatched. This chick survived for five days, and was then,
presumably, eaten. The second clutch had only one egg, which was in-
cubated for a period of ten days, and was then deserted.
It would seem, therefore, from what has happened to date, that on 2
diet of oxheart, some Owls are quite capable of laying fertile eggs. How
much of this fertility is due to the Veterex remains a problem for further
investigation, as does the problem of why some eggs are eaten and others
not. Similarly I have been unable to ascertain whether the chick dies
and is then eaten or whether the parents kill it, but from observations
I have been able to make, the latter seems more probable.

mng birds, of which one subadult male soon died. The others showed
) to be 1 male, 3 females, in 1963 1 male and 1 female died, and then I
id to find some males. 1964 I succeeded in getting one, and in 1965
ree males. Unfortunately the 1964-male died in December 1965. In
)66 one female had two, the other three clutches of two or three eggs;
lly one was fertile and it did not hatch.
In autumn 1966 female number 1 in moult got a red throat-patch, not as
*eat as in the male and somewhat darker.
In 1967 there was only one infertile egg, and in the autumn female 2 got
&amp;gt;me red feathers on the throat. In January 1968 female 1 and a male died,
found them hanging dead in the twigs; they presumably died in their
eep.
On 10th of January I discovered three eggs in a birhen nestbox, you
in buy them for tits and other garden-birds. Interior measurements:
iight 22cm. diameter 10cm. and diameter of the entrance 6cm. On
muary 21st there was at least one chick; the female was in the box under
le inspection and the young seemingly three or four days old. Some days
ter I happened to see the female out of nest and on inspecting I found
iree young with a little dark down, light flesh-coloured skin, and
ale bills and legs. The chicks thrived, although I never saw the parents
eding them, but my experience with Loriculus vernalis, Vernal Hanging
arrakeet, is that the female alone feeds the young, and she herself is fed
y the male, with a white pastelike mass. It seems to be normal, as the
male always becomes bare round the bill and somewhat dingy, when the
ale is clean and full-feathered.
The young thrived, and I inspected the nest daily. As others besides
yself have found, the nest is very soiled, so you have to change the
isting material. Three times during the last part of the nesting period I
id to change the sawdust.
In the morning of the 20th of February I found the female dead in the
ater-basin, she apparently had fallen dead from the twigs as only one side
as wet. One of the young ones sat in a corner of the flight, and it was
burned to the nest. Now I several times this day inspected the chicks
&amp;gt; see, if the male would feed them, and fortunately he did. The following
vo days one young was out of nest and was returned to it, as I was afraid
le male would forget the two others in the nest if the young was allowed
1 be out of nest.
The 24th two young were out of nest, the third was dead in the box.
he young are light green with red rumps, pale flesh-coloured legs and
ale horn-coloured bill. The front-feathers shining pale green.

216 WILLIAM H. TIMMIS--BREEDING OF THE KOOKABURRA AT CHESTER ZOO
The 27th of March I found one young dead, presumably it had flown
against the wire and broken its neck.
The last chick is in good health and is now with the other inmates of the

(Dacelo novaeguineae)
By William H. Timmis (Curator of Birds and Mammals)
The Kookaburra ( Dacelo novaeguineae ) is an inhabitant of the sclerophyll
and savannah woodlands of the eastern section of Australia from west of
Adelaide to Cape York. Whilst it extends through the drier country in
the south where the range overlaps that of the Blue Winged Kookaburra
(D. leachii ), it is essentially an inhabitant of the coastal mountains.
In Cape York, D. novaeguineae is dominant in the hilly country of the
central range of the Peninsula, whilst D. leachii is the common species
elsewhere (drier areas). It has been suggested that the susceptibility of
D. novaeguineae to heat and drought possibly places it at a competitive
disadvantage with D. leachii in the north of the continent.
Dacelo novaeguineae was introduced to south-western Australia in 1896
and to Tasmania in 1905 in both of which the species is now well estab-
lished.
Chester Zoo received a Kookaburra in i960 and two more in 1965.
The first specimen proved to be a male and although the two received ir
1965 were sent to us as a pair, they proved to be two females. On 23rd
May, 1968, one egg was laid under three logs positioned in a small aviary in
our Temperate Bird House, a second egg was laid on 25th May and a third
on 27th May. Both male and female incubated the eggs for a period of 2 i
days (the birds did not commence to incubate until the last egg had beer
laid.) Only two eggs hatched and I assumed that the third was infertik
but three days after the first two hatchings, a third chick was observed ir
the nest although the egg was just a little distance from the nest. How^
ever, after four days the third chick disappeared, possibly having beer
mistaken for a mouse or food.
The young were blind for 15 days and the first chick left the nest at 3c
days, the second at 32 days. Both adults took part in brooding an&amp;lt;j
feeding the young and I was able to keep a record of the feeding schedule
The birds were fed twice a day at 8.00 a.m. and 4.30 p.m. From one t&amp;lt;
four days--four small fresh-killed mice cut into small pieces, 15 mediun
sized locusts, 12 mealworms and four ounces of chopped uncookec
horsemeat. From four to 12 days --10 fresh killed mice and small rats

The young were closely guarded by the adults for several weeks even
tough the chicks were able to look after themselves immediately upon
aving the nest. Feeding by both adults continued three or four times
day for about six weeks, after which the young gradually learned to seek

By Thomas R. M. Brosset (Gothenburg, Sweden)
Mr. Tage Larsson, Resterog, has given me the following few details of
e breeding of the Jendayax Nanday Conure. The male Jendaya and
ie female Nanday Conure were both acquired at the same time, probably
iring early spring, 1962. They went to nest the same year and reared
*me young (four, Mr. Larsson thinks) in a single nest: followed by
lother two broods of four and three young ones in 1963. For some
ason their nest-box was taken away in 1964 and later the pair and some
the hybrids were sold to Norrkoping C.B.S., which runs a Bird House
a park in the city, where the birds can still be seen. No further
*eeding attempt has been made. I quote and translate Mr. Larsson's
vn words: " They were the easiest birds to breed and I could have had
many young as I wanted " (. Burspraket , vol. 8, no. 2, p. 29, 1966).
Here are some of the more noteworthy breeding results in Sweden
iring 1967 (F = has been considered as a "first" breeding in Sweden):

Mr. Magnusson also had five chicks in a nest of a young pair of Princess
of Wales's Parrakeets, but unfortunately they were all killed by the
parents when about ten days old. Of course he hopes to breed them
successfully in 1968, as well as he hopes that his pairs of Blue-winged
Grass and Barraband's (new young male introduced to the old female
Parrakeets will go to nest and rear young ones, too. None of these
species are known to have been bred in Sweden before.
Mr. Forsberg's wife partly hand-reared a young Scaly-breasted Lorikeet
because it was plucked by its parents. This year, she has also hand-
reared a young Swainson's Blue M^ountain Lorikeet, and, when writing
this, a new half-grown Scaly-breasted Lorikeet is being reared by it:
parents. To prevent it from being plucked, it has been placed in a smal
cage, and is now fed quite well through the wire-netting. If reared t(
maturity by the parents, the breeding will no doubt be regarded as &amp;lt;
"first".
Mr. Forsberg's collection of parrot-like birds is very interesting an(
varied, and for the moment he keeps pairs of the following species, man
of which have been bred: Red-rump and Splendid Parrakeet, Fasten
Rosella, Swainson's, Forsten's, Scaly-breasted, Perfect, Ornate, an&amp;lt;
Chattering Lory, Festive Amazon Parrot, Jendaya Conure, White-winge*
Parrakeet, Moustache and Plum-headed Parrakeet, Cockatiel, Abyssmiai
and Peach-faced Lovebird. Also, he keeps a pet green-winged Macaw.
I paid a visit to Mr. Jan Hogberg, Sorunda, last Christmas,
female of his pair of Blue and Gold Macaw has died, but he has importe
some new Lories, Cockatoos, Hanging Parrots, and a pair of Everett
Blue-backed Parrots (if I am right). Two young Swainson's Lorikeet
were just about to leave the nest, and a pair of Senegal Parrots (not my ol
pair, but the other breeding pair he bought some years ago) had three c
four youngsters in the nest-box.
Mr. Einar Winroth, Vaxjo, phoned me the other day and said, he ha
to tell me that he had six one week old chicks Abyssinian Lovebird in or
nest. I never heard of more than four young per nest of that species.

MESIA x PEKIN ROBIN HYBRIDIZATION
By L. Hervouet (Ville d'Avray, France)
In the spring of 1966 I put one Mesia cock and two Pekin Robin hens in
a large planted aviary. In April I remarked that one of the hens was
paired with the Mesia cock: the two birds were almost inseparable, flying
about together, perching together and being very attentive to each other
which, in Leothrix language, signifies love . . .
During May and June the hen brought some coconut fibres and seemed
to want to nest, but the preparations went no further.
In 1967 as soon as the month of March came round, I replaced the three
birds in the aviary, firmly hoping for a rapid result. In the same aviary
there was a pair of Shamas. These birds started to nest in the early part of
April, but the trio, on the other hand, did not start nesting, although they
seemed to have excellent intentions (namely fetching fibres etc.).
At the beginning of July I removed the surplus hen and a few days later
a nest was built in a genista bush of about 4ft. high by the hen paired with
the Mesia. Three eggs were soon laid and sat upon and kept warm alterna-
tively by the cock and the hen. The birds were very tame and I was able
to take several photographs of them, without their leaving the nest. After
a period of thirteen days, two young birds were hatched (the third egg was
fertilised but did not hatch) and were perfectly well reared by the two
parents on ant eggs, mealworms and maggots. No other food was
accepted. In twelve days the two young ones had feathers and left the
nest; but they could not fly and, had the weather not been fine and warm,
I am afraid they would not have survived. The plumage of the young
hybrids was slate-grey with white down on the stomach; one had the same
pale orange-red beak as the hen, while the other had a more yellow one
(like the Mesia, but much paler). I am curious to know what the definite
colours will be. It is certainly a case of hybridization made very interesting
through the behaviour of the parents. I have seldom seen such a brave
and devoted pair of birds: they did not hesitate to attack the Shamas if they
approached the younger ones and, when the latter left the nest and I
approached to try (in vain) to put them back into the nest, the indignation
of the parents was concentrated on me: they flew around my head, alighting
very near my hands, making a great noise and having a menacing manner--
this attitude changed immediately when I retired and threw them some
mealworms.
The eggs much resemble those of the Canary, except that they are
perhaps a little larger. The nest is made of coconut fibres, in the form of a
cup and hangs from branches in bushes.

By Joseph Bell, Associate Curator of Birds (New York, U.S.A.)
The bird breeding program at the Bronx Zoo during 1968 has been
extremely interesting, varied in the experience offered to the bird-keeping
staff and rewarding in the numbers of good specimens reared and added to
the collection. In all, 209 birds of 40 species were reared. Worthy of
special note in this group were, 22 Greater Rheas Rhea americana, and 18
Darwin's Rhea Pterocnemia pennata , the first birds of this order to be
reared here. Also breeding and producing young here for the first time
were Australian Radjah Shelduck Tadorna radjah rufitergum , Hawaiian
Duck Anas platyrhynchos wyvilliana , Argentine Ruddy Duck Oxyura
vittata , American Ruddy Duck Oxyura jamaicensis, and Ruff or Fighting
Snipe Philomachus pugnax. A pair of Scarlet Ibis Eudocimus ruber , nested
again this year in the RIVERBANK display of the AQUATIC BIRDS
building and raised two chicks. In the TREETOPS exhibit of the same
building a colony of Boat-billed Herons Cochlearius cochlearius , has con-
tinued to thrive. Nine young boat-bills have left the nests so far this year
and six chicks and a number of eggs are being brooded at this writing.
Fourteen boat-bills were reared in this display during 1967.
Two White-faced Glossy Ibis Plegadis chihi , chicks that were hatched in
a nest in an outside enclosure during the summer, did not survive a heavy
rainstorm on the evening following hatching. The greatest disappoint-
ment of the breeding season was an egg incubated by a pair of 1 ufted
Puffins Lunda cirrhata , in a burrow in the SEA CLIFFS display in the
AQUATIC BIRDS building. After more than 30 days of brooding, the
egg was found in the exhibit's pool with a fully developed dead embryo.
Among the more interesting new specimens added to the collection
during 1968 were:

hese birds were imported from Kenya. From Mr. Charles Cordier who
s now working in Bolivia we received two fine specimens of the Mountain
^aracara ( Phalcoboenus megalopterus). This pretty species which has
lever been represented before in our Zoo occurs in the Andean Highlands
nd therefore seems to be rather resistant to low temperatures. As Mr.
Wordier wrote us, it had been rather difficult to catch these Caracaras
)ecause the Indians in the region of the Po-opo lake believe that they
&amp;gt;ring misfortune to them and therefore normally do not hunt the birds.
The mountain Caracara is unable to catch the wild Guinea-pigs which are
&amp;gt;lentiful in this region: instead of hunting by itself it prefers to attack
agles and to force them to let fall their prey. Our two birds settled down
ery quickly after their arrival. They are always active and seem to be
ery sociable with other birds of prey. They often take a sand bath,
specially in warm weather. The sexes are alike; young birds can be
listinguished from adults by their entirely brown juvenile plumage.
On June 16th, one Black Vulture was hatched in the incubator and hand-
eared by the head keeper of our bird house. The young bird has still its
avenile plumage but in size he had already reached that of his parents by
he end of August. This is the fifth Black Vulture to be hand-reared in
ur Zoo.

Unfortunately we again failed to raise the young Condor which hatched
on June ist, after an incubation period of 59 days. During the first
weeks the young developed very well but on July 9th suddenly it was
found dead. As the autopsy revealed, the parents had fed it with too
many hairs and so caused severe constipation. Nearly the same happened
last year: that time the young bird's stomach was overloaded with stones.
As the parents do not seem able to rear their young in the normal way, the
next chick will probably have to be hand-reared, like the Black Vultures.
In our Owl collection the African Spotted Owls (Bubo africanus) bred
for the first time and reared one young, and from our old breeding pair of
Snowy Owls we again got six young which were given to other Zoos.

At the sixth attempt (two during 1967 when chicks were hatched but did
not survive, and four this year when the first two eggs were broken and one
chick lived for only a few days), the Princess Stephanie's Bird of Paradise
has reared a chick to the stage of flying strongly, though not, as yet, feeding
itself.
We had actually given up hope of further nesting this year, but towards
the end of July after adding a little material to the original nest, the usual
clutch of one egg was laid, and as before, the male was removed, for he
chased the female whenever she came off. She is a diligent mother but
not good at nest-building, so we assisted by fixing a disused Song Thrush s
nest at the site and when the chick had become quite large and the nest
began to subside and tilt, we substituted a large mud nest built by
Struthideas.
We thought that the incubation period was longer than the usual twenty-
one days this time and the chick hatched on the 15th of August and left the
nest on the nth of September, a strong and apparently healthy specimen.
We have heard much recently on the diet of Humming Birds, but it had
not occurred to me that mice are a favourite food of Birds of Paradise or
at least of this Princess Stephanie's--until we saw one being eaten by it.
This mouse was taken away because it might have been diseased or affected
by an anti-coagulant, but thereafter we provided freshly-killed mice and
the bird skilfully removed all the flesh, leaving only the bones, the bowels
and the everted skin.
Another interesting hatching is that of the Tasmanian Waterhen,
Tribonyx mortieri. The parents are birds bred at Basel Zoo during 1967.
In the spring, we put the pair out on the Three-island Pond, where they
are virtually at liberty for they easily leap across the surrounding moat and
wander about the Gardens, when all is quiet. The nest was built in a

clump of plants near the moat within a few feet of the passing visitors and it
was well concealed, but sometimes it was possible to see the gleaming red
eye of the sitting bird peering out from among the leaves. Seven eggs were
laid and two blackish chicks were hatched and are so far thriving. The
Australian Tribonyx ventralis was bred here in 1869 and in 1871, but T.
mortieri , so far as I know, has not been bred in this country.
One Pochard, six Tufted Ducks, one Sacred Ibis, five Peafowl, two Barn
Owls and two more Grey-backed Thrushes have been bred. Rufous
Babblers built and incubated eggs and when they had given up, two eggs
similar in colour to those of Hedge-Sparrows were left in the nest.
A rarely exhibited species is the Great Blue Turaco, Corythaeola
cristata , of which two young birds and an adult were received from Uganda.
A female Hawaiian Goose has been sent on deposit from the Wildfowl
Trust and this makes a mate for the male received from the same source in
1961. Two Ornate Lorikeets have been presented by Mr. A. Booth and a
pair of Namaqua Doves deposited.
The following birds have died and the longevity records may be of
interest, though the ages of some were not known at the time of their
arrival: a Magellan Eagle-Owl received in 1948 and the father of the young
one bred this year, a White-faced Scops Owl received in 1950, a Magellan
Penguin bred here in 1951, a Cock of the Rock and a Golden Hangnest
collected as adults by Mr. David Attenborough on his Zoo Quest to
Guiana in 1955 and a Green Broadbill collected as an adult in Borneo by
Dr. K. C. Searle in 1959.

Longevity. An Asiatic or Siberian White Crane Megalornis leucogeranus
that arrived at the National Zoological Park, Washington, on 26th June,
1906, died on 22 nd March, 1968. It was thus in the Park 61 years, 8
months and 25 days. It was found in the Bird House with a compound
fracture of the left leg. The leg was set and put in plaster but a com-
bination of age and shock proved too much.

The smallest parrot. Colin Harrison has kindly examined the skins in
the British Museum (Natural History). He reports: "Allowing for the
fallibility of measuring the lengths of birds, especially when they have been
made into skins, I cannot find any significant differences in the size of the
various smaller species of Micropsitta. I think all one can say at present is
that, as a group, they are a little over 3 inches long. The tiny specimen of
M. nanina referred to by Sharpe in his checklist was, in fact, a very
immature bird."

Mother Carey's chickens is an old sailors' name for the Storm Petrel
Hydrobates pelagicus and any other small species of Petrel.
But whence the name?
Captain Philip Carteret, of His Majesty's Sloop Swallow , says that
during his voyage round the world they saw many petrels " to which sailors
have given the name of Mother Carey's chickens " (HawkswortKs Voyages ,
vol. 1. p. 318, ed. 1773)- From which it is evident that the name was in
current usage in 1767. It is now generally considered that the name
derives from " Mater Cara," the Divine Virgin, guardian of all seamen.

Mrs. Charles T. Johnson, Lompoc, California, has a small aviary,
containing some forty waxbills and small finches. Included in this
number were an Orange-cheeked Waxbill male and two Lavender Finch
females. The Orange-cheeked paired with one of the Lavenders and
three young hybrids were reared during May, 1967.
The female parent died in December and the Orange-cheeked im-
mediately paired with the second Lavender, and two youngsters were
reared in January, 1968.
Russ and Neunzig have recorded Orange-cheeked x St. Helena and
Orange-cheeked x Grey Waxbill, but I believe this is the first time the
present cross has been obtained.

Included were seven Congo Peacocks Afropavo congensis , the first living
specimens to be seen outside Africa. The seven consisted of five adult
males, one immature male, and one female. Three of the males and the
single female died during 1950. A fourth male died six years later, a fifth
in 1965, and the sole survivor in February this year--after almost nineteen
years in captivity. * * #
In the last number of the Magazine I mentioned that Mr. Charles Lucas
had completed twenty-one years as Editor, "Australian Aviculture.
Mention might perhaps be made of a few other long-serving Editors.
Mr. Wesley T. Page edited " Bird Notes " (F.B.C.) during its entire run of
twenty-three years, less the final number.
Mr. David Seth-Smith was Editor, sometimes solely, sometimes in
conjunction with others, of our Magazine for some twenty-three years.
Miss P. Barclay-Smith with thirty years to her credit, has surpassed the
foregoing. It is to be fervently hoped that she will eventually emulate Dr.

Caius Plinius (Secundus) the Elder (A.D. 23-79), said in his Historia
Naturalis , Lib. x, cap. xli: " Beyond all Psitaci repeat men's words, and
even talk connectedly. India sends this bird, which they call Psitace, with
the whole body green marked only by a scarlet ring upon the nape. It will
pronounce " Hail Emperor," and any words it hears; it is especially
sportive after wine. The hardness of the head is the same as of the beak.
And when the bird is being taught to speak, it is beaten with an iron rod,
else it feels not the strokes. When it flies down it receives its weight upon
its beak, and supports itself thereon; and thus lightens itself to remedy the
weakness of its feet." Hail mighty Caesar. We about to die salute thee!

W. L. Weatherly, Victoria, writes: " I am at the moment rearing four
Cape Barren goslings completely by hand. We are also rearing a number
with the parents. They are extraordinarily tough and easy to rear. We
removed two eggs from a clutch of six a week before hatching and placed
them in a supposedly self-regulating oven. The temperature, in^spite of
frequent checks and regulations, fluctuated between 106 0 and 80 b., and
the humidity never reached above 75 ** Both eggs hatched about a day and
a half premature, after I had " helped " them, a usually fatal process.
After that traumatic experience they were very weak and it took all my
skill to get them to feed. They are now well-grown; they had been
doubling their weight per week till one kilogram was reached it then took
ten days to increase to two kilos! From all this I have concluded that as
ova and as very young goslings, Cape Barrens are virtually indestructible.

Rutgers, edited by K. A. Norris. London: Blandford Press Ltd.,
1968. Price 21 s.
When reviewing Vols. 1 and 2 of the first (English) edition of this work
Avicultural Magazine 1966, 72 , no. 2, p. 66) I warmly recommended them
3 ut with the reservation that I did not agree with all the statements therein,
hat the terms " species " and " variety " were wrongly used as if they
vere synonymous and that a few (only) of the colour plates gave a faulty
mpression.
This volume deals with the passerine birds. Its author is obviously, as
1 stated previously, a bird-lover in the best sense of the word and one great
virtue of the book is that it does not give the impression that birds are " no
:rouble at all " to keep. Practically all of the species likely to be readily
obtainable, besides many that are not, are dealt with. There are 147
:oloured photographs depicting (unless I have miscounted) 146 different
species.
The least satisfactory photographs in the previous edition have been
replaced by better ones. The colour reproduction of many of the others
is better in this edition although it is worse in the Mountain Bluebird on
plate 143. Anyone who has had anything to do with getting coloured
illustrations into a book will, however, know the trials and tribulations
involved and that perfection is, as Cicero said of good government, "A
thing to be hoped for rather than a possibility." Perfection has not been

*.achieved with all these illustrations--though I think it has with the
Rainbow Bunting on plate 81--but they are mostly very good. The
commonest flaw is for russet and chestnut to appear too fiery and brilliant
(e.g. plates 94, 95, 68) but, as it can look a bit that way in the live bird in
certain lights, it is, perhaps, a fault on the right side.
There still appears some small confusion over species, races and
varieties. The latter word is, for example, used on page 144 in precisely
the same context in which " species " is correctly used on the previous page.
The races of the Avadavat and Golden-breasted Waxbill are treated as
races nomenclatorially but referred to as species (pp. 145 an( ^ I 54 )*
I am doubtful of the claim (p. 58) that hybrids have been produced
between the Canary and Chaffinch and, from my own experience of this
and other corvine species, I most emphatically do not believe that, when
Lanceolated Jays fail to breed successfully, the cock " is generally the
cause of all the trouble," a statement for which no evidence is given.
These strictures should not, however, deter anyone from buying this
book. It is an excellent work and would, in my opinion, be cheap at twice
the price.

BREEDERS OF GREAT EAGLE-OWLS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99137488" page_id="58089269"  page_num="228" year="" vol="">
A Sussex reader reminds me that Eagle-Owls were formerly kept and bred at
Arundel Castle. I did not include these birds in my summary of breeders because
they were very probably Virginian Eagle-Owls Bubo virginianus virgimanm
I do not think I can do better than quote William Borrer (The Birds ot Sussex,
page xvii) (1891): " Concerning the Owls formerly in the Keep of Arundel Castle,
which I believe were generally supposed to be Eagle Owls, and were mentioned as
such by Mr. Knox in O. R. p. 91, as they were for many years a great attraction to
visitors, a few words may be expected, though they have no claim to be called
Sussex birds. I may say that when I saw them many years ago I had no doubt that
they were the Virginian species, in which opinion I am confirmed by the following
notice in ' The Beauties of England and Wales,' vol xiv. p. 82, by F. Shoberl, where,
speaking of the Keep of Arundel Castle, he says: " The Owls which are kept here
were a present to the Duke from North America." This was published m 1813.
Mr. J. PI. Gurney kindly made enquiries for me of the present Duke, who most
courteously gave all the information in his power, stating that he believed it to be
the fact that the Owls were introduced into the Keep by Charles, the nth Duke,
who died in 1815, and that some were still remaining when he himself came to the
title in i860, but that during his minority they gradually disappeared from the
Castle, though two were remaining in a garden in the town up to the end 01 1009.
Mr Mostyn, the Duke's agent, kindly forwarded me a letter from an old man, tor
many years the custodian of the Owls, who states that they occasionally bred in the
Keep, producing but one egg in the season, and hatching it; but in 1859 one bird
laid three eggs, which produced three fine young, which grew to maturity. Une 01
the Owls, which had long been known as Loyd Thurlow, at last laid an egg, w c
was the subject of considerable amusement. Mr. Gurney had a cutting from the

death of this bird left seven birds in the Keep, one of which was 63 years old

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Council to any Member
who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of bird which
shall not, in the opinion of the Council, be known to have been previously bred in
captivity in Great Britain or Northern Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain
the Medal must send a detailed account for publication in the Magazine within
about eight weeks from the date of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence
of the facts as the Council may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases
where the young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly
independent of their parents. The question of awarding a Medal for the breeding
of local races or sub-species of species that have already been bred shall be at the
discretion of the Council. No Medal can be given for the breeding of hybrids.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford instruction
to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine before it is
published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of the young, and
be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the species.
These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal is
under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Council shall be final.

'STIMULITE' NECTAR FOOD is a COMPLETE NUTRI-
TIONAL food in highly concentrated form. It is highly
beneficial to alllivestock, whether it be Humming Birds,
Sun Birds or other Nectarines, Insectivorous Birds, Fruit-
eaters, Canaries, Finches, Parrakeets, Parrots, or any kind
of animal. This supreme food should be available to
them at all times.
Recently there has been some advocacy of a sugar and protein diet for
Humming Birds, such a diet is very deficient in nutritional value.
PROTEIN is produced within the body by METABOLISM from the
nutrients in the food consumed. A diet, to be fully nutritional, has to
contain all the essential vitamins. A, D, E, C, and the full vitamin B
Complex, Bl, B2, B6, B12 (known as the animal-protein factor), the full
context contains Thiamin, Riboflavine, Nicotinic Acid, Pantothenic Acid,
Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Inositol, Choline and Biotin. Only a food
containing all of these can be termed COMPLETE.
Metabolism can only convert the food into protein if the food also
contains the following amino acids : Arginine, Histidine, Lysine,
Trypotophane, Phenylalanine, Methionine, Leucine, Isoleucine and
Valine. All these factors are necessary for a fully nutritional food, they
are not hearsay, but SCIENTIFIC FACTS which can be verified.

(Chlorophonia flavirostris )
By Mrs. K. M. Scamell (Newdigate, Surrey, England)
This rare Chlorophonia is found in Ecuador with possibly a subspecies
i Colombia. However, in The Birds of Colombia , by Meyer de Schauen-
;e, P- 353, a hen from Colombia is described together with a cock from
cuador, as no male specimen appears to have been collected in the former
Duntry.
The descriptions given are as follows:
Length 4 in.
S Head, throat, chest and sides of body, back, wings and tail bright
green, upper back crossed by a broad yellow collar. Lower breast
and belly yellow, separated from the green of the breast by a
narrow chestnut band. Iris white, bill yellow or salmon, legs
salmon.
9 Bright grass green, centre of breast, abdomen and the under tail-
coverts bright yellow. Bill reddish brown, feet and legs reddish
yellow. Iris white.
We were fortunate in buying a cock bird from a London dealer last May
id, as can be seen from the coloured photograph, it corresponds with the
)ove description. Incidentally, the photograph was taken on one of
iose very wet days last June by a visitor from Sweden, a Mr. Thomas
. M. Brosset from Gothenburg. The bird is not unlike a miniature
irrot and has a penetrating whistle when it wants to attract attention,
irticularly if it is hungry. We had the greatest difficulty in weaning it
om the banana diet it came over on from Ecuador. It spent the summer
onths alone in a small aviary, but it feels the cold and we have now caged
in our conservatory where the minimum temperature is about 55 0 F.
has now (late November) almost completed its moult, and though I
itered it for the National Exhibition of Cage Birds at Alexandra Palace,
doubted if its feathering would be completed in time for the Show.
I feed this little bird on the same diet I give to about a dozen of the
ore delicate softbills such as Manakins and Festive Tanagers, and as I
ive now modified the recipe and method of preparation since I mentioned

give this briefly below:
For one day's requirements for 12 small birds, I use oz. each of
finely minced lean heart meat, tomato, pureed carrot, dried breadcrumbs
or rusks and minced Fdam cheese. I do all the mincing in a Moulinette
and stir in the breadcrumbs and cheese into the wet ingredients with a
fork, adding i\ teasponfuls of Gerval-Protein or Super Hydramin. I
then add 1 diced small sweet apple and 1 diced pear plus about a dozen
cut-up grapes. The whole batch is divided between the morning and
evening feeds, the latter being held in a domestic fridge until required.
No live food is given.

(Lorius roratus roratus)
By Mrs. N. Howard (Codsall Wood, Wolverhampton, England)
My pair of the Ceram race of the Eclectus Parrot (Lorius roratus roratus )
differ from the New Guinea or Red-sided race (L. r. pectoralis ), of which I
have two pairs, in aspects of both behaviour and appearance. The Ceram
birds are very shy and also very docile and can be handled safely. The
hen is brilliant red on head and neck, with a band of 2 to 3 in. of rich
lightish blue across the breast and continued round the back of the neck as
a collar. The wings, back and rest of the bird are a deep maroon. The
cock is rich green, less red on the sides than the Red-sided race, black
under the tail and with the whole body faintly washed with black.
The birds were given plain canary seed, paddy rice, sunflower seed,
millet spray, together with sweet ripe pears and grapes. In general the)
are rather different feeders to other Eclectus Parrots. The cock eats onl)
plain canary, the hen white sunflower and paddy rice, and both eat a large
amount of fruit. I would say they are 75% fruit-eaters.
They were housed in an aviary with a brick-built heated house and 2
long outside flight. A nest-box was given them, placed on a platforir
near the roof. It was roughly made of 1 in. wood, placed on its side ant
not upright, and was 2 ft. long, 13 in. high and 12 in. wide, with the
usual round hole.
I had this pair for six years. In 1966 the hen laid two clear eggs ir
January and again in May, but in September two chicks were hatched
but died at the age of six weeks. In 1967 the pattern was similar unti.
August, when one chick was hatched but died at eight weeks. In 196^
she again laid clear eggs in January and April. Very little notice was taker
after this until July when she was again sitting on two eggs. On 24th Jul)
one chick hatched, and the second the next day.

After the earlier failures I had little hopes of rearing them but decided to
Iter the feeding. Having a very large garden of fresh sweet garden peas I
ecided to give these in great quantities, after having tried all the other
reen food and found that they would not eat it. They took these, and
Iso had their usual amount of ripe pears and grapes and seed. The
hicks made very good progress, growing rapidly and feathering quickly,
dy trouble then began when the garden peas were finished. I knew
rom past experience that pomegranates were required. They were not
et available from our shops, but a large London store obtained a supply
3 r me and my troubles ended. The male chick was out of the nest at
even weeks, followed by the female in a few days, neither entering the nest
gain.
The nest-box was removed after a few days to make more room on the
latform for the chicks and the hen. The male bird was fully feathered,
nd with flight feathers, at eleven weeks. Both were feeding themselves
y this time. The food supplied was boiled Patna rice with milk and
agar added, half a pound of grapes, three pomegranates, one large ripe
ear, two millet sprays, two morning coffee sweet biscuits, and one cob of
weet corn. The cock chick is rather shy, but the hen chick is just the
averse. It was evident from very early on that the chicks were a pair,
le skin of the hen chick being a different colour from that of the cock, and
i first feather it is the same colour as the hen. At the time of writing they
re flying.
As described, Mrs. N. Howard has bred the Ceram Eclectus Parrot
Lorius roratus roratus). It is believed that this may be a first success,
.ny member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this subspecies
1 Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at once

<bodyText confidence="0.995415166666667" page_id="58089313"  page_num="4" year="" vol="">
By Alan Lendon (Adelaide, Australia)
This bird, which nowadays is generally considered to be a well-defined
race or subspecies of the well-known Pale-headed or Mealy Rosella, if
correctly designated Platycercus adscitus adscitus , as the original description
of the species by Latham in 1790 was from a bird considered by Gregory
Mathews to have been collected at Cooktown in northern Queensland.
Consequently, the better known race, originally described and depicted by
Lear in 1832, is correctly labelled P. a. palliceps. Subsequent descriptions
of the blue-cheeked bird as amathusiae by Bonaparte in 1850 and as
cyanogenys by Gould in 1855 are invalid, although reasonably appropriate,
The range of the species extends from the northern extremity of Cape
York Peninsula throughout most of eastern Queensland and across the
border into north-eastern New South Wales; on the western side of the
Great Dividing Range it comes south approximately as far as a line joining
Moree and Inverell, whilst on the coast it reaches the Clarence River
Whether there is a gradual and imperceptible transition from the northerr
race to the southern, or whether there is a gap in the distribution or &amp;lt;
sharply defined change as apparently occurs between the two races of th(
Eastern Rosella (P. eximius ), the writer has been unable to ascertain
Keast refers to an isolate in the Bowen area (lat. 20 *) but the source of this
statement has not been discovered. However, the blue-cheeked certainl)
comes as far south as Mareeba and probably to Cardwell (lat. 8*), whik
the southern race goes north at least to latitude 21 0 and probably further
Gould figured the Blue-cheeked in his Supplement to the Birds Oj
Australia (pi. 63), whilst a lovely plate by Roland Green in Mathews
Birds of Australia (Vol. 6, pi. 304, p. 338) depicts typical examples of botl
races. The Emu (Vol. XXX, pi. 14, p. 81) published a plate by Nevilk
Cayley showing both sexes of the common race and a male of the northern
It is worthy of note that, in northern New South Wales where th&amp;lt;
ranges of the Pale-headed (P. a. palliceps ) and the Golden-mantled (P
eximius cecilae ) Rosellas overlap, hybridization occurs to a considerabl&amp;lt;
degree.
The relationship between the two races is best described as similar t(
that between the Eastern Rosella (P. eximius eximius ) and its Golden
mantled subspecies (P. e. cecilae , formerly splendidus ). The Blue-cheeke(
differs from the southern form in at least four important respects. Firstly
the margins of the mantle feathers are a creamy yellow colour, peculiarly
suffused with pale blue, as opposed to the golden yellow of the bette
known race. Secondly, the cheek patches are, as the vernacular nam&amp;lt;
implies, almost entirely blue, rather than white with a blue lower border
Thirdly, the upper breast and sides of the neck are pale yellow to a variable
extent as against uniform blue. Finally, the rump is yellowish-blu&amp;lt;
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.991900111111111" page_id="58089314"  page_num="5" year="" vol="">
athcr than bluish-green. Seen side by side, males of the two races look
o be closely allied but different birds. Females of the blue-cheeked race
iave noticeably smaller bills and rounder heads and are appreciably
luller in most colours.
The first occasion that I saw this species in life was in February 1955,
vhen there were three adult birds in the collection of Sir Edward Hallstrom'
^.t that time he was uncertain of their identity and thought that they
ould have been hybrids between the Pale-headed and the Northern
losella [P. venustus ). Sir Edward successfully bred this variety on a
jreat many occasions thereafter, almost certainly the first recorded
ireeding anywhere.
The author acquired an immature pair of these birds early in 1965;
hey were in rough plumage and very timid, obviously recently trapped,
hey took some time to quieten down but eventually did so and moulted
ito fine plumage. It was not until they were moved to new aviaries in the
Adelaide Hills in 1966 that they showed any disposition to go to nest.
&amp;gt;aying was commenced in the spring, the male having previously been
xtremely attentive to the female, offering her regurgitated food almost
on-stop. It is estimated that between eight and ten eggs were laid in an
bliquely-hung log, but each was broken after two or three days. The log
\0x25A0 as then moved and suspended in a vertical position, whereupon five more
ggs were laid and incubated very closely by the female. Of this clutch,
nly one egg hatched after an incubation period of approximately twenty
ays; when the remaining eggs were removed, one was found to contain a
illy developed embryo, another a partially developed one and the other
no were infertile. Between four and five weeks after hatching, the young
ird left the nest; it appeared certainly a hen by the size and shape of the
ead and this subsequently proved to be correct. Its immature plumage
as merely a considerably duller version of the adult; it was observed to
ave a bath on the third day after leaving the nest and appeared independent
fits parents in about two weeks. Adult plumage was attained by a partial
loult at about the age of five to six months and it was shortly afterwards
iven to a friend who had an unmated male; however, it succeeded in
reaping, and if it has survived it is probably producing unattractive
yhrids mated to an Adelaide Rosella ( P . adelaidae) male!
In the spring of 1967* the old pair hatched three young which survived
&amp;gt;r about a fortnight and were then found dead one morning with full
\0x25A0ops; it is thought that the hen may have ceased brooding and a cold
ight ensued. A second clutch later the same season was deserted when
ie lid of the log somehow became detached; three eggs contained embryos
1 the point of hatching.
This subspecies has become quite common in local aviculture in recent
iars and has bred freely in the eastern states. The Adelaide Zoo has
&amp;quot;ed it successfully on several occasions, but I am not aware of any other
iccess in South Australia to date.

STARLING

<bodyText confidence="0.987912666666667" page_id="58089315"  page_num="6" year="" vol="">
(Lamprocolius purpureiceps)
By T. S. Thomson (Hoole, Cheshire, England)
I had kept Purple-headed Glossy Starlings (.Lamprocolius purpureiceps)
liberty in the past and they were an obvious selection for including ir
controlled liberty experiments involving several other species. Thre&amp;lt;
Starlings were purchased in the late summer of 1967 an d housed in ar
unheated aviary together with Zebra Finches, Silverbills, Firefinches
Cordon Bleus, Spice Birds, Tri-coloured Nuns, Orange Weavers anc
Red-eared Waxbills. No aggressiveness was noticed.
The aviary flight was 40 ft. x 12 ft. and the shelter 40 ft. x 7 ft-, th&amp;lt;
flight opening into a 70 ft. x 7* ft- compartment which was also cultivate!
as a vegetable garden. T he birds were given access to this latter breeding
compartment in February, all nest-boxes and nesting sites having beer
fixed therein, and a flock of 50 Budgerigars from an adjacent aviary wen
also released into this compartment.
I did not consider the Starlings to be tame. They did not take meal
worms from the hand as had some of their predecessors. The three kep
together through the winter but in early spring one bird tended to keej
apart on its own, and the first indication of any breeding inclination wa
an attack by one of the pair on the third bird, which was removed after
second attack occurred.
The cultivation of the garden necessitated spells of duty in this aviar
compartment and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the Gloss;
Starlings had a nest with two eggs, a third being added later. 1 he egg
were mottled all over and like a Blackbird's in colour, but more rounde&amp;lt;
in shape.
The hen Starling continually left the nest when the aviary was entered
I expected more eggs and did not realize that incubation was in progress
On most occasions when the hen returned to the nest she carried a piece 0
leaf, frequently dead brittle laurel leaf. This was used as a nest lining
Pear leaf in the green state was also used and this practice continued unt
the young were nearly a week old. The nest was built in a lovebird-size
nest-box, dried grasses forming a shallow cup-shaped cavity in about 6 ii
of this material. There may have been some grasses in the box before th
Starlings started building.
The Starlings ignored Zebra Finches nesting 6 ft. away and a Budgeriga
occupying a box 9 ft. from the Starlings' nest; no harrying of near neigb
bours was observed. Unlike the British Starlings nesting in an adjoinin
aviary, only the hen Glossy incubated the eggs.

T. S. THOMSON--BREEDING THE PURPLE-HEADED GLOSSY STARLING J
The Glossy Starlings had wintered with a staple diet of Haith's Softbill
Dod plus over-ripe apples, no live food being offered. Maggots are bred
n the premises from early spring and supplies were available to feed the
en on leaving the nest during the incubation period. About 20 maggots
time were taken. A pair of Blackbirds were rearing a family at this
eriod and it was found best to feed the maggots to the hen Glossy on her
wn.
The nest-box was occasionally inspected. The cock bird voiced his
bjection to such intrusions, especially after the young hatched, with
arsh cries and sometimes would make a pass at human intruders.
The first indication of eggs having hatched came when the hen carried a
ingle maggot to the nest. For the first few days only one maggot at a time
/as taken, this being first beaten on the perch by the hen. The young
/ere a few days old before the cock started feeding and from then on he did
ally 50% of the work. Two young hatched together and the third fully
day later. The latter never caught up with the two nestmates, there
eing a slight difference in size right up to fledging.
The young were five days old when the entire roof of the 70 ft. x 70 ft.
reeding compartment was removed. One advantage of liberating birds
rom such an extensive area is the fact that they are well equipped for free
ight. The timing of this operation is governed by the state of nesting of
le various species. Weather conditions also have a bearing on the
nnual liberation involving over 100 birds.
If there had been the slightest doubt about losing the Starlings on
beration, the cock bird could have been confined to an adjacent aviary,
^ith normal methods of release where an exit/entrance is made in the
viary netting, it might be prudent to either train the cock or hen first,
fis depending on the species.
Before liberation the Starlings used to search the vegetable garden,
nding various forms of live food to supplement the ever-present bowl of
laggots. At this time the home-produced supply of mealworms was at
low ebb, only a few per day being available. On liberation the Starlings
Don found craneflies in the lawn and foraged systematically in neigh-
ouring gardens. A local sports ground with acres of close-mown grass

A supply of mealworms was purchased, but with the young making
ood progress the parents were encouraged to forage for themselves,
lowever, they were given maggots and mealworms in the evenings, the
&amp;gt;rmer being ignored if sufficient mealworms were offered. About 50 to
00 per evening were taken in billfuls of 12 to 15 a time. Mealworms
ere arranged in the beak as regularly as the teeth of a comb. The
lealworms in larvae form were preferred to the pupae. The parents were
ctive late in the day. A few large brown moths were also found and on
ire occasions a medium-sized earthworm would be included in a beakful
f live food. The Starlings would swoop down from trees to take large

spiders thrown down on a concrete path. Various beetles, woodlice and
earwigs were also taken, but such offerings formed an insignificant
proportion of the amount of live food collected by the birds themselves.
They also sampled ripe strawberries and other fruits, but only live food
was fed to the young up to and immediately after fledging.
The parents usually alighted io to 20 ft. from the nest-box, and after
surveying the area made one or two bounds to the nest. Prior to fledging,
the young were fed at the entrance without the parents entering the box.
The young frequently called in the nest and flapped their wings in practice
for flight.
The two advanced young left the nest and followed their parents about.
The third youngster was heard to call for prolonged periods, and with the
cock Starling only making infrequent visits to the nest-box it was decided
to supplement his efforts by hand-feeding. The hungry young one
readily accepted mealworms but was not so keen on maggots. Bantam
eggs were hardboiled daily for young Pheasants, and the young Starling
consumed half an egg per day.
The eyes of the young were dark with no trace of the parents' brilliant
yellow. At the time of writing, the young are four months old, the irides
are gradually turning light grey. In the nest the wings and tail were
glossy while the head and body feathering was dull. At three months the
first glossy feathering appeared in the head and body.
Nest sanitation was first class compared with the native species. The
hen Starling regularly deposited the faeces on top of a liberty Budgerigar
nest-box about 100 ft. from the nest.
A month after fledging, the two young, now self-supporting but still
flying with the parents, were caught up. They were wild compared with
the part hand-reared young one, which is now very tame. During their
month of free flying the young rarely entered the aviary proper with their
parents. Softbill food, with mealworms and maggots mixed in, was
placed in the shelter in an effort to accustom the young to aviary conditions.
All roosted somewhere beyond the garden, and with Tawny Owls always
active, and the need to " domesticate " the young, the confinement to
the aviary could not be prolonged. This no doubt ruled out any hope of a
second round. The " catching up " and " domestication " of birds
bred at liberty is an essential part of the controlled liberty cycle.
Our native species of Starling has been bred by me for eleven years by a
combination of the liberty system and normal aviary conditions, the main
object being to study the stamina of the species after breeding for several
generations from aviary-bred stock. Future plans must now include the
building up of a strain of the Purple-headed Glossy Starling on the lines
practised with the British species. The controlled liberty system offers
possibilities of establishing strains of various foreign species.

(Rollulus roulroul)
By Kerry Muller (Washington, D.C., U.S.A.)
On 12th August 1965 we received two female Crested Green Wood
Partridges (Rollulus roulroul), commonly called " Roulrouls ", for the
collection at the National Zoo. We were delighted to acquire these, as
they are rather uncommon and valuable in captivity and one of the most
beautiful of all the game birds. The male has a red fan crest, red legs,
dark chestnut wings, black body plumage and a white fore-crown, while
the female, with her bright green head and body and light chestnut wings,
is equally attractive. Both sexes have a bare red patch surrounding the
eyes.
Having received the two females we made every effort to obtain a male,
and in July 1966 we finally obtained a fine wild-caught male from Malaya.
At first he was very wild and shy; however, he soon settled down with one
of the females, ignoring the other completely.
These birds were housed in an L-shaped indoor exhibit that is approxi-
mately 10 x 20 x 8 ft. high. Within the cage or aviary is a small shallow
pool and the aviary itself is heavily planted with bamboo and semi-tropical
plants. Housed with the Roulrouls were several other Malaysian birds,
including Bulbuls, Babblers, a Shama Thrush, Fairy Bluebirds, a male
Black-breasted Rain Quail and a Hooded Pitta.
After the birds had paired they exhibited an increased activity, searching
the plantings and aviary floor for small twigs that they moved from place
to place. At this time the female began laying eggs indiscriminately about
the aviary, and these were removed and placed in our electric incubator.
To aid the female in her nesting activities we added pine needles to the
floor. These are obtained by the bale and are used for mulch in various
aviaries. The needles were readily accepted, and she soon had constructed
a substantial nest that was shaped roughly like a hemisphere, with an
entrance hole on one side just wide enough to admit the hen. When the
hen is sitting she is very difficult to observe, as she often partially blocks
the entrance hole with pine needles. Also, when she leaves the nest she
covers the eggs with pine needles and feathers. One rather spherical
white egg is deposited daily, the average clutch ranging from 4 to 6 eggs.
The eggs that were placed in the incubator (at a temperature of 99*5* F.
and a relative humidity of 85*) hatched in 22 days, and all the young
emerged strong and active.
When the Roulrouls began manifesting nesting activity I started searching
the available literature at my disposal for information dealing with raising
Roulrouls in captivity, and was unable to find any account on this subject;

therefore, I was forced to develop my own methods, which I will pass on
to the reader in case he (or she) finds himself in a similar situation.
When the parents hatch their own eggs and are allowed to raise the
young, they do an outstanding job. We have never lost a young bird left
with the parents. After hatching, the male assumes an equal role in
domestic duties and usually half the young will be under his care. The
parents are very solicitous of the young and are constantly offering them
bits of food in their beaks. The young instinctively look for food from
their parents' beaks and do not normally seek food from the ground until
the fifth day.
The parents are very courageous in the defence of their young, par-
ticularly the male, and any other bird approaching within 3 feet will be
immediately driven off.
All young Roulrouls are fed the following twice daily: Game Bird
Startena (Purina) mixed with A &amp; D feeding oil, " mockingbird mix ",
ground cooked egg, chopped greens, finch seed mix and mealworms.
The primary diet for the first five days is mealworms, then they begin to
consume egg and Game Bird Startena. In addition, the adults get a
small amount of chopped fruit, bread-and-milk mix and ground raw meat.
In contrast to the success we have had in raising young Roulrouls left
with their parents, we have found that the road to hand-raising them is
beset with several difficulties. The young are removed from the incubator
when they are completely dry and placed in a 3 ft. square brooder by
themselves. We have found we must try and imprint the newly-hatched
Roulrouls to our hand, as they must be hand fed for the first five days and
will not pick up food normally from the ground. If they are put with
other species of baby game birds, such as pheasants or chickens, they will
invariably try to feed from the bills of the other young birds and con-
sequently starve to death. This would probably be true also of a foster
parent such as a bantam hen.
We have found that several young hatched together do much better than
a single chick, as there is some competition to see which one will get the
food first when proffered by the fingers, and this tends to stimulate feeding
within the group. It is very difficult to hand-raise a single bird; they just
seem to fade away. When we tried to put newly-hatched young with
those already hatched a week or more, the older birds would often pick
on the younger ones.
We had very good luck in introducing newly-hatched young to parent
birds who had hatched young themselves within a 36-hour period of the
incubator-hatched ones. The incubator-hatched young, not yet im-
printed, blended perfectly into the family group within 30 minutes. All
parent birds accepted incubator-hatched young readily.
As soon as the incubator young had settled into the brooder and began
feeding from the hand, we began offering them bits of Game Bird Startena
and ground cooked egg, as well as mealworms. On the fifth day they

should begin eating the food mixture from the feed pan, and the quantity
of mealworms must be curtailed sharply, for the birds are very susceptible
to dietary upsets at this age as well as from 9 to 14 days. This does not
seem to hold true for young reared by the parents, who perhaps induce
them to eat a wider variety of food as well as to get a great deal more
exercise.
We initially start the brooder young at 90* F., and after a week lower the
temperature to 8o* F. At two weeks it is lowered to 75 0 F. They should
not be kept at a lower temperature until grown, and even the adults prefer
75 0 F. or above.
When first hatched the young are surprisingly large in relation to the
egg. This is due, in part, to a good covering of down with which they
are well endowed.
In colour they are a combination of black and dark brown with flesh-
coloured beak and legs. The eyes are black. A complete description is
as follows: Median line of forehead and crown, superciliary line, lores, eye
ring, front of eyeline, sides of nape, rump, sides of breast and shoulders are
black. Sides of crown, auricular area, back of eyeline, rear of nape and
back are dark brown. Throat, belly and vent are lighter brown, shading
to dark on the sides.
At five days the primaries are beginning to show; by seven days they are
well grown and the secondaries and wing coverts are showing. These have
a chestnut distal half and a darker brown base, which gives the appearance
of barring when the wings are closed.
When the chicks are two weeks old they begin to assume their first
plumage. This closely resembles the female, with the exception of the
lower breast and belly that are a dull black with greenish tones.
At this age the two sexes can be differentiated by the colour of the
wings: The female's wings are a light chestnut brown; in the males, the
brown is a darker shade. The young partridges retain this colouring
through the age of about 12 weeks and then begin to attain the adult
plumage. At this time they should be removed from their parents, as the
adult male will often try to kill the young cocks.
The first year, we hatched 25 young and raised 17 to maturity. This
season we have hatched 24 young and raised 22 to maturity. The sex
ratio has been almost even.
I hope to see this beautiful species become well established in captivity.
There can be no more beautiful and pleasing game bird in any collection,
and with the ever-increasing human population expanding into the remain-
ing wild areas of the world, the time is rapidly approaching when these
birds and many others will no longer be available to aviculturists from the
wild. Upon the aviculturists falls the task of either successfully establish-
ing and maintaining the species or losing them for the aviculturists of the
future.

During the three years that I have lived in Hawaii I have hand-raised
seven species of passerine birds: House-Finch ( Carpodacus mexicanus
frontalis ), House-Sparrow ( Passer domesticus ), Ricebird ( Lonchura
punctulata ), White-eye ( Zosterops palpebrosus japonicus), Common Myna
( Acridotheres tristis ), Brazilian Cardinal ( Paroaria cucullata ), and Hawaii
'Amakihi ( Loxops v. virens). All but the last named are species that have
been introduced into the Hawaiian Islands. The 'Amakihi is a bird found
only in the Hawaiian Islands, belonging to the endemic family of Hawaiian
Honeycreepers (Drepanididae).
An excellent discussion of the advantages of working with hand-raised
birds and suggestions for the diets and aviary maintenance of insectivorous
birds in captivity are provided by Berger {The Jack Pine Warbler, 44:
^ 5 ~ 7 2 " 1966). It was under Dr. A. J. Berger's supervision and through
his constant encouragement that the following experience was gained.
Obtaining and Handling the Birds
The campus of the University of Hawaii provides an excellent habitat for
the breeding activities of many of Hawaii's introduced birds. The six
species of introduced birds that I hand-raised were all from nests on cam-
pus. The Hawaii 'Amakihi were collected by Dr. Berger from two nests
taken in his study area on the slopes of Mauna Kea on the island of Hawaii.
" The optimum age for most passerines would seem to be the age at
which the feathers are beginning to unsheathe and before the fear reaction
develops " (Berger, op. cit.). The optimum age will, of course, vary with
the species. I collected House-Finches, House-Sparrows, Ricebirds and
White-eyes that were half-feathered. These birds gaped readily and
showed no fear reaction. Mynas and Brazilian Cardinals that were half-
feathered, however, had already developed the fear reaction and would not
gape. Because Mynas are common on campus, I have had the oppor-
tunity to do more work with them. If the fear reaction has developed in
the nestling Myna, the bird will just sit there and starve. I tried various
means to elicit the gaping response, including simulated figures of the
adult birds. I found nothing to overcome this fear reaction in the Myna.
1 he Brazilian Cardinal also develops the fear reaction before it is half-
feathered, and is best taken from the nest when the feathers are just
beginning to unsheathe. The 'Amakihi that I hand-raised were about
half-feathered when collected and gaped readily.

A good test before collecting is to tap on the nest lightly with your
finger and make a " squeak ". If the birds gape readily, then you are in
luck: if they crouch down in the nest, then, if possible, select a nest with
younger nestlings. I have tried force-feeding Mynas, and it is a tiresome
and often unrewarding experience. Some birds will gape after being
force-fed once, but more often the force-feeding must be continued.
I found it best to collect the nest itself, or, if hand-raising only a few of
the nestlings, to place them in an old nest. The young settle down in the
nest, can be fed easily, maintain good nest sanitation, and remain in the
nest until approximately normal fledging time.
I put the nest and the young nestlings into a small box that could be
covered at night. With the box on my desk, I could go about my other
work while caring for the birds. Because I was attending lectures and
teaching laboratories, it usually was necessary for me to carry the nestlings
with me so that they could be fed when hungry. I carried the nestlings in
a plastic lunch-bucket which also contained feeding forceps and a small
container of prepared diet. The lunch-bucket could be closed after
feeding and the nestlings would then settle down in the nest.
I agree with Berger (op. cit.) that the birds should be fed on a demand
schedule. When a bird is hungry it will give a food call and gape. The
demand schedule must be learned for each species. Some birds, as the
White-eyes, will eat only a little at a time but must be fed often. My
White-eyes demanded food every 8 to 10 minutes during part of the
nestling period. Other birds, as the Myna, may eat more at a time and
go longer between feedings. My Mynas demanded food only once
every two hours. The food must be placed deep in the bird's throat to
trigger the swallowing reflex. Older nestlings and fledglings may grab
the food from the feeding forceps.
The birds may be conditioned to a specific whistle, " squeak ", or other
noise to induce gaping. The birds early learn to recognize the person
who is feeding them.
After one or more of the young birds fledged, I placed their nest in a
small cage supplied with perches and adequate room for the birds to take
short flights (some of the birds returned to the nest at night). The small
cage enabled me to reach the birds easily for hand-feeding. I placed
small feeding cups near the perches, and hand-fed the fledglings from the
feeding cups. As the fledglings developed they would fly to the feeding
cups and peck at the food. When the birds became independent they
were transferred into an aviary.
Even after the birds have become completely independent they show a
definite responsiveness to their foster parent. The fear characteristic of
most wild birds that have been caught as adults and caged is lacking in
hand-raised birds. The hand-reared birds go about their normal
activities in close proximity to the observer. Herein lies the joy of hand-
rearing.

Very little has been published on diets for hand-raising nestling
passerine birds in captivity or for keeping the adult birds alive and healthy.
I feel that too often the diets used are limited to hamburger or bread
soaked in milk. The following table is the result of considerable experi-
mentation with various foodstuffs. These diets have been successful for
us and we have experienced very low mortality rates.

(Forpus coelestis x F. cyanopygius)
By P. Haddock (Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, England)
I introduced a male Lesson's Parrotlet (Forpus coelestis ) and female
Turquoise-rumped Parrotlet (F. cyanopygius) into a small aviary 8 ft. x
z\ ft. x 6 ft. with a small adjoining shelter, which already housed
two pair of Budgerigars. The aviary was situated in a backyard, since at
the moment I have no garden. The Parrotlets appeared to ignore the
Budgerigars. In the aviary shelter I had placed three Budgerigar nest-
boxes, one placed on end with a layer of peat covering the bottom. After
some eight weeks the cock Parrotlet started occasionally feeding the hen,

and mating on the perches was observed twice. Both the Parrotlets
refused to allow the Budgerigar hens to enter any nest-boxes to lay, and I
removed all the Budgerigars.
The hen Parrotlet laid four eggs and started incubation on approxi-
mately 27th July. I did not see the hen again for three weeks, the only
proof of her existence being the cock entering and leaving the box when
feeding her, and the droppings present on the plants in the flight. At the
end of this period, still not having seen the hen nor heard any chicks, I
looked into the nest-box and saw four chicks. The chicks progressed
slowly, and the hen was now seen occasionally on hot days. After
approximately six weeks three fledglings left the nest (two hens and a cock),
one young dying just before fledging.
The young were wild and frightened at first, but are now settling down.
Three days after the young had left the nest the hen died. I have no idea
what was wrong with her. The young went into the nest-boxes to roost
at night. I wonder whether the behaviour of the Budgerigars which were
present at first may have stimulated the Parrotlets to begin nesting?

(Muscicapa striata)
By D. Blacktopp (Cheshunt, Herts., England)
This species was bred in an aviary more by accident than design, and I
have therefore only a little information on it. The following notes might,
however, be helpful to other aviculturists.
On 2nd September 1967 two young Spotted Flycatchers [Muscicapa
striata ) were brought to me by a park-keeper, having been found in a nest
when a tree was felled. I hand-reared them, and during the winter kept
them in a birdroom where the temperature was maintained at about 50* F.
by a paraffin heater and a tubular electric heater. The fighting was
controlled by a time-switch to provide light extending the day from 06.00
to 21.00 hrs., and a dull red bulb remained alight throughout the night.
The flycatchers shared the flight with a pair of Common Redstarts
(Phoenicurus phoenicurus).
In April 1968 the flycatchers were put into an outside aviary which they
shared with a pair of Blue-headed Wagtails (Motacilla f. flava). The
aviary was one of a row and measured 12 ft. from front to back, 3 ft. in
width and 6 ft. 2 in. in height. The rear end and 3 ft. of the sides and
6 ft. of the roof were covered in to form a shelter. This was, however,
rather dark inside when the vegetation had grown, and it was difficult to

see what was happening in it. The vegetation included ivy, honeysuckle,
bamboo and various low bushes, and the front and top were partly over-
grown by a Russian Vine, giving additional cover but partly obscuring the
view.
In order not to disturb the birds too much they were fed through a
feeding hatch in the front of the aviary, the hatch being of sheet metal, and
the food being placed on a small shelf behind it, sheltered by a transparent
plastic hood. The birds were fed on gentles, " Farex " baby food mixed
with milk, "Avivite " soft food, and grated cheese. At intervals they were
given a few mealworms. "Abidec " multivitamin drops and " P.Y.M. "
yeast preparation were regularly added to the food. A variety of nest-
sites were put up in the aviary, both in the shelter and open flight, mainly
for the benefit of the wagtails since I did not expect the flycatchers to
breed.
In May a certain amount of squabbling and bill-snapping was noticed.
During a period of a week or more the cock was seen to carry a particular
piece of twig about with him; and at the same period he began to spend
most of his time at the front of the aviary while the hen kept to the back.
Subsequently this became the normal pattern and as a result the absence
of the hen during incubation was not immediately apparent.
I did not normally enter the aviary, and as long as both the birds were
present and fit I left well alone. My fiancee had undertaken most of the
feeding of the birds, and during August she told me that the flycatchers
were fighting more than usual. On the evening of 7th August I looked in
and found to my surprise that two fledged and apparently independent
young were being chivvied by the cock. Since the fighting continued I
took a chance and removed them to the birdroom, and while in the aviary
made a search and found that the nest had been made in an open-fronted
box fixed at the very back of the shelter. The nest was composed of a
little fine moss, and feathers shed by the wagtails.
The two young seemed a little more nervous than the hand-reared
parents but settled down to feed independently. At the time of writing
both are doing well.
As described above D. Blacktopp has bred the Spotted Flycatcher
(Muscicapa striata). It is believed it may be the first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at
once with the Hon Secretary.

By Herbert Murray (Brentwood, Essex, England)
The larger tanagers are easy to keep in aviaries, are reasonably hardy,
and taken on the whole are easy birds to get to go to nest, although the final
result is not always as good as one would expect. I have now managed to
breed three species of these larger tanagers, have had partial success with a
fourth species and have in addition bred one of the smaller species. In
1968 I bred for the first time the Crimson-backed Tanager (. Rhamphocelus
dimidiatus ), which as a possible first breeding has been reported more
fully elsewhere in this journal. The other species previously reared were
the White-shouldered Black Tanager ( Tachyphonus luctuosus), the Ornate
Tanager ( Thraupis ornata ), the Rufous-crowned Tanager ( Tangara
cay and), and the partial success was with the Golden-backed Tanager ( T .
chrysotis). The following notes on these might be of interest.
It will be seen from the above that tanagers are probably as easy as any
of the softbills to rear, but there is a great deal of difference in the way the
various species behave.
The White-winged Black Tanager has been bred several times, and is
relatively easy. I bred these birds to the third generation without loss of
vigour, but they became increasingly territorially-minded and murderous
as they became more domesticated. As they are powerful birds and very
swift they can cause a lot of damage in a mixed collection. The hens are
fearless of man, and many broods are reared in a year if the birds get the
chance. The usual brood is two young, and the great advantage of these
birds for aviary breeding is that although they feed their young with
mealworms given whole, they will also feed their usual soft food and this is
a great help as it varies the diet. When the young of the first brood are
self-supporting the parents do not drive them away, but all the birds both
old and young stay together. These tanagers are very fond of blowflies.
The nest is a rather flimsy affair usually placed in gorse, and the hens are
so steady that they never leave the nest when anyone approaches.
The Ornate Tanager I have bred to the second generation, and here the
rearing and general behaviour of the birds is the same as that of the White-
winged Black Tanager. The only real difference that I have seen has been
in the fact that my birds built in parakeet boxes. The Golden-backed
Tanager is a very lovely bird, and this is a species that I have not managed
to rear to maturity, mainly, I think, because the parents would only feed
live food to the young.
Another interesting breeding I have managed to achieve this year is
the Yellow-winged Sugar Bird ( Cyanerpes cyaneus). This bird has been
bred a number of times previously, but the breeding took place where I
could observe the birds quite closely and the following notes may perhaps
be of interest. This breeding also took place in a communal aviary, and

as the cock came up to full breeding condition he became very aggressive
and was soon in charge of the planted subtropical aviary. He was very
fast and no bird disputed his power. A neat, rather deep, nest was built in
a tall-growing fuchsia, and in time two young hatched. The mother
worked very hard to feed these youngsters, but the cock was much more
interested in showing off and fighting anything that came along. One
could be very anthropomorphic here, but I will not labour the point.
The length of the beak of the young when small was about the same as
in any soft-billed bird, and when the young flew the beak was only about
half the length of the adult bird, but the beak grew rapidly and was soon as
long as in the adult bird. The coloration of the young is similar to the
adult hen, but with rather a grey tinge. Unfortunately one of the young
birds has a twisted beak, but it seems to be able to feed itself without any
bother. The other young bird is quite normal. A further round of
young are due to fly as these notes are being written, but the nest is not
easy to observe, and as it just rests on the plant, and as far as I can see is
not attached in any way, one cannot pull the plants about much. Both
nests were built about 3 ft. from the ground, but I think this is only
coincidence as I have had a nest built previously much higher, but here
the eggs did not hatch. As with tanagers, the young birds are not driven
away when new young are in the nest, but continue to fly about with their
parents.
The young Sugar Birds were fed mainly on small flies, and it intrigued
me very much to see how the hen held these. She would catch a beakful,
about six to ten insects, and these would be stowed away neatly as they were
captured, the body of the fly being held in the middle of the beak and the
wings projecting out of the sides, giving a sort of frill effect. The insects
were not bunched together at all, but were spaced evenly up the beak.
This sounds easy to do, but how does the bird do it? If one supposes that
she is holding five flies which fill the beak to half its length, how does she
insert the sixth fly in its place as presumably the first five are being held
against the upper mandible by the tongue? It is a pretty problem and I
do not know how she does it, but she certainly does. These birds will also
feed their normal soft food to the youngsters, which is a big help. It is
usually the cock bird that does this, presumably because it is so much less
work than hunting. I first saw the young being fed with soft food when
about three days old, but such feeding was irregular and probably depended
on the number of flies available.
Once the young Sugar Birds can fly they are fed a lot of banana. This is
picked off the fruit in reasonably large lumps, and stuffed into the young
bird. Sugar Birds are amusing to breed, and have been bred a fair number
of times, but I think if the birds were in a small aviary it would be necessary
to have some good cultures of fruit flies going.
My biggest disappointment this year has been with the Purple-bellied
Parrot (Triclaria cyanogaster or T. malachitacia). I have two pairs of

these rare and lovely birds which I imported from Brazil about four years
ago. In many ways these birds differ from any other South American
Parrot I have ever kept.
They were tricky to get on to normal food when first imported, but it
did not take them long to settle down to a normal diet. I tried to breed
these birds in small aviaries in the summer of 1967, but had no success. I
decided that this year I would really try to get them to breed. It has
always been my experience that birds in individual aviaries spend all the
summer trying to get at the nest-box in the next compartment, so for the
whole of last winter I left them in a large aviary 48 ft. x 17 ft. containing
a number of nest-boxes in different sites. There was a heated shelter in
this aviary 8 ft. x 17 ft. The birds spent a great part of the daylight
hours in the flight, going in and out of a nest-box that seemed to attract
them, but suddenly in February they went to nest in a box in the shelter.
This was a relief, since although the birds seemed hardy I did not want
the hen to nest outside at that time of the year.
To my great satisfaction I heard a young bird in the nest after the hen
had been sitting for about three weeks, but then the question arose, on
what do these birds feed their young? Nothing seems to be known about
their habits and feeding in the wild, and birds which come from rain forests
in Brazil would certainly feed their young on something other than
monkey nuts and seed. Soft food and live food they would not touch,
although I have seen them catch flies on the wing with the same circular
flight as that of a Spotted Flycatcher. Fruit, which they would never
touch if put into a feeding pot, they would sometimes eat if hung on a
perch, but in my opinion a great deal of the natural food of these birds is
obtained from leaves and bark. When I heard young the question became
acute. Bark I could manage, but normal green food at that time was out of
the question, so I let them into my subtropical aviary knowing that they
would find some fresh growth there. They liked this very much, but did
not completely destroy everything. I ceased to hear the young after about
1 week, but the cock went regularly to the box, and, as I thought, got on
with feeding the young, but when I finally looked in the box about six
weeks later there was one dead youngster that had died at about a week old.
This was most disappointing, but I have had previous experience of birds
^oing all through the breeding cycle if young are lost.
As nothing much seems to be known about these birds, the following
lotes may be of interest. When first imported--probably they were
/oung birds although they were already in adult plumage--they seemed
0 need a lot of green bark and leaves. They will also eat the algae
growing on wood, and will catch flies. They take a lot of nectar. Seeds
md monkey nuts are eaten but not much fruit, but they will eat hawthorn
)erries, blackberries, elderberries and grapes. These birds play together
ike lorikeets, and seem indifferent to man rather than friendly. Where
)erries contain stones, as in hawthorn, only the pulp is eaten. Other soft
)erries seem to be eaten whole.
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.999188046511628" page_id="58089329"  page_num="20" year="" vol="">
When fully adult and paired their previous tolerant and friendly
acceptance of other parrot-like birds, or birds of any size above finches,
ceases and they become very savage. The smaller fry in an aviary they
ignore.
Their flight is very swift and much more like that of an Australian
Parakeet than a South American Parrot. Where a Pionus or Amazon
Parrot flies swiftly but heavily, these birds fly much more lightly, and I
have seen them fly like a shrike with long glides with only the tips of the
wings moving, but the speed and accuracy of the flight of these parrots is
superb. When first imported they flew everywhere, and seldom walked or
crawled in the way of a typical parrot, but I have noticed recently that
they crawl much more than they used to. The call is quite distinctive,
difficult to describe, but is quite musical and unparrot-like.
As soon as the hen decides to sit, she gives up feeding herself, and once
she really starts brooding she hardly leaves the nest. About a fortnight
after hatching she does come out of the box for a time, but never goes more
than a few feet away. She sits on guard, usually about 6 ft. from the nest,
while the cock bird does the foraging. As far as I could see she made no
attempt to feed herself or search for food until the young would have been
about a month old had they lived. There was no sign of a second brood.
The other pair made no attempt to nest. The birds have completed a
moult which takes a long time, and the cock of the second pair has grown
a number of odd gold feathers which gives him a mottled effect. The
coloration of these birds is a deep mossy green similar to a cock Eclectus,
the wings and tail are bluish, and the cock has a large purple patch on his
lower stomach. The beak is distinctive, being large, heavily hooked, and
nearly white in colour.
Like all birds coming from really dense forest, Purple-bellied Parrots
spend a lot of time motionless and with the head held forward and the
shoulders humped. Most parrots when dosing, rest their heads on their
back, always with one eye showing, but these parrots never seem to do so,
but sit looking rather like hawks. One gets the impression that they
may be partly insectivorous in the wild, but I have no real proof of this
except that I have definitely seen them catch flies, but their speedy and
beautiful flight would certainly tie in with this. Most of these parrots
imported in recent years seem to have died fairly quickly, and in view of
the export restrictions from Brazil it looks unlikely that any more will be
imported, so I most sincerely hope that I shall at last be successful in
rearing them.
Golden-breasted Buntings {Embenza flaviventris) laid but did not hatch,
but taking the year overall it has been the poorest breeding season I have
had. Never have the birds looked so fit and in such bounding health, and
never have they produced fewer young.

By J. Delacour
Although the weather was cold and wet most of the spring and summer,
the last breeding season can be considered as fairly satisfactory. Dr. P.
Ciarpaglini has now settled down at Cleres and he has been able to re-
organize many things which had been perforce neglected during the long
illness of the late Frank Fooks. His great skill and experience as a bird
veterinarian has resulted in the saving of many young birds which could
not have survived otherwise. In a park heavily stocked with birds,
brought over from all parts of the world during half a century, practically
all parasites, bacteria, viruses and other disease-causing organisms
flourish, and it certainly is the case with us. Appropriate treatment is
thus essential from the beginning if chicks are likely to live.
We were lucky again with Emus, seven of which were hatched in
April and easily reared. Later on, two dozen Rheas were raised, half of
them white. Ostrich eggs proved infertile.
Over 400 waterfowl were successfully reared. There were Black-
necked Swans (9), and Emperor, Grey-Lag and Bar-headed Geese. A
pair of Pacific Black Brants, adult-caught in Eastern Siberia three years
ago, unexpectedly laid four eggs. The young were rapidly reared by the
parents, who had incubated their clutch in the middle of a lawn on which
thousands of visitors walk; but the gander kept them at a distance and no
one disturbed the nest. The young are delightfully tame. A pair of
Red-breasted Geese nested, but the eggs were stolen by vermin.
Magellan, Ruddy-headed, Ashy-headed and Andean Sheldgeese bred
normally; a pair of the latter had a brood of eleven. There were a
good many Common, Ruddy, South African and Paradise Shelducks, and
two Magellan Crested Ducks. Also Fulvous Whistling Ducks (40).
Large numbers of ducks were reared, of the following species: Greenland,

years, laid for the first time and hatched eight ducklings, one of which only
was reared, due to accidents. It was the more unexpected that the old
female has partly assumed a masculine plumage the last three years,
having a black head and white cheeks.
It is interesting to report that a pair of Cape Teal laid four times
between March and September, each time successfully. It confirms
that some southern hemisphere species may have a very long breeding
season.

We now have suitable pairs of many species of waterfowl which do not
figure in this list, particularly a pair of Trumpeter Swans sent by the U.S.
Government. We hope to have much to report next year.
A pair of Tasmanian Water Hens, at liberty in the park, reared five
young in April. They had two more broods during the summer, but they
inexplicably failed to rear them.
Gough Island Moorhens, in an aviary, hatched several chicks, but
reared only one.
A pair of Andean Giant Coots ( Fulica gigantea ), reputedly flightless,
did fly away from the lake in October, probably following migrating
in the company of Common Coots.
Many Peafowl were reared, but the Brush Turkeys met with an accident.
The male that had produced eight young in 1967 was hurt in fights with
Peacocks and died in June, with the result that only one chick came out of
the mound. We have now two males and four females well settled down
in two different parts of the park, and a young male in reserve.
Many Pheasants were raised: Blue Eared, Cheer, Hume's, Malay and
Siamese Firebacks, Tonkin Red, Sonnerat's and Ceylonese Junglefowls,
Grey Peacock Pheasants (eight from one pair), Edwards', etc., and many
Chinese Quails.
We keep few Parrakeets, but three Crimson-wings, eight Bourke's and
many Lovebirds were reared.
Young doves were not as numerous as we had expected, probably due to
the inclement weather. We, however, reared a fair number of Wonga-
wongas, Longtailed (Macropygia rnichall), Brush and Common Bronze-
wings, Green-wings, Australian Crested, Grey-headed ( Geotrygon
caniceps ), Peaceful, and other small species: Columbina cruziana and
passerina, and Metriopelia caeciliae. An old pair of Blue-headed Doves
(Turtur brehmeri) for the first time produced young ones. For the last ten
years, they had been tried in various outdoor aviaries and greenhouses, but
they never nested. They were finally placed in a large indoor flight also
inhabited by various passerine birds, and they soon started nesting.
Squabs were hatched, but they never survive long if left to the parents.
We had to take them out when ten days old and hand-rear them.
During 1968 we have acquired new birds and made up pairs of many
species of which we only possess odd specimens. We are also improving
our breeding accommodation and we hope therefore to have greater success
to report in 1969.

On 5th July 1968 I observed a pair of Lesser Snow Geese eat one of
their own eggs at an island nesting colony of Ross's Geese ( Anser rossii)
and Lesser Snow Geese at Karrak Lake (67* 15&apos; N, ioo* 15&apos; W), in the
Canadian Arctic. The egg had been 2 ft. out of the nest for six days. I
broke the egg accidentally while checking the remainder of the clutch
(four eggs). The Snow Goose pair returned to the nest site immediately
after my departure. The female went to the broken egg and began eating
the contents. A few seconds later the male joined her and within two
minutes the yolk and albumen had gone. The female then returned to her
nest and started incubating. The male stood nearby within the nest
territory.
In six summers of research at Ross's and Lesser Snow Goose nesting
colonies, this was the first time that I observed wild geese eating their own
eggs (see Ryder 1964, 1967, 1969). It would, however, seem to have a
definite selective advantage in Arctic nesting geese. Firstly, the yellow
coloured yolk could possibly attract predators such as the Glaucous Gull
(Larus hyperboreus), Herring Gull (L. argentatus ), Parasitic Skua ( Ster -
corarius parasiticus) and Long-tailed Skua (-S&apos;, longicaudus ) to the rest of
the clutch. Eating the egg contents would thus eliminate or at least
decrease the chances of predation. It remains enigmatic why the geese
did not dispose of the egg shell after eating its contents. Surely the broken
shell acts as an attractant to predators. Secondly, the Snow Geese could
have eaten the egg contents simply because they were hungry. Arctic
nesting geese lose considerable body weight during the nesting season.
Breeding female Ross's Geese lose up to 800 grams (44% of the average
body weight) during egg laying and incubation (Ryder 1967). I tend
to agree with Bergin (1968) who postulates that Budgerigars ( Melopsittacus
undulatus) may have evolved egg-eating as a nutrient saving mechanism
in the natural environment where food is scarce. Although food is not
scarce on the mainland tundra during the nesting season, it is lacking at
the island nest site where the geese spend most of their time (Ryder 1969).
I find it difficult to explain why the geese do not break more abandoned
eggs if the contents serve as an obvious reserve food source which, in this
case, was recognized and readily accepted.
The ideas expressed are based on only one observation, but I think the
egg-eating phenomenon in wild and domestic birds has rather important
ecological and evolutionary implications which require further study.
Aviculturists have an excellent opportunity to observe and document
such " abnormal " behaviour under controlled conditions.

BREEDING OF THE VULTURINE GUINEA-FOWL
(Acryllium vulturinum )
AT DAWS HALL WILDFOWL FARM

</table>

when I shot about a dozen of these beautiful birds in Northern Kenya
about ten years ago.
In 1964, on my return to this country, I started to keep ornamental
waterfowl and pheasants, and was determined at the first available oppor-
tunity to include species of guinea-fowl in the collection. Four \ ulturine
Guinea-Fowl duly arrived by air from Nairobi in the summer of 1966.
They were housed in an aviary 8 yd. by 9 yd. with a small shelter in one
corner, and fed on a mixed diet of corn and turkey growers pellets. Like
all birds of the family Phasianidae, they like nothing better than live
insects, and were given a quantity of blowfly maggots once or twice a week.
I was surprised, considering the barren thorn scrub which is their natural
habitat, at the amount of grass that they consumed, but there is no doubt
that this forms an integral part of their diet.
During winter nights or when snow was on the ground, they were shut
up in their shelter and were given an infra-red lamp when the weather was
particularly cold. One bird lost condition and died during that winter,
leaving two cocks and a hen for the following year.
On 1 st December 1967 one egg was found lying in the pen. This
proved to be infertile. In 1968 one male became noticeably aggressive
towards the other, and the hen started laying on 1st August. This egg
was immediately lifted, and a chicken's egg of similar appearance put in
its place, but the latter was eaten by the guinea-fowl. A second egg was
laid in a different place four days later and exactly the same thing happened.
When the third egg was laid, two days later, a dummy egg was used as a

substitute, but the hen promptly deserted this prospective nest and laid
her subsequent eggs in different places. Thereafter the eggs were lifted
when dropped and no attempt made to replace them. Altogether, 18
eggs were laid, in three haphazard clutches, the last one on 1st October,
after which the birds moulted. The eggs were creamy-white and pointed,
size 50 x 36 mm.
The eggs were placed under broody hens, and transferred to an electric
incubator as soon as they began to chip. Hatching results were as

There was an electrical failure during the night that the last two chicks
hatched, and unfortunately both were dead by the morning. The
remaining eight chicks were reared without any problem, and at the time
of writing the oldest is 12 weeks and the youngest 5 weeks.
Each batch of guinea-fowl was ready to come out of the incubator 24
hours after hatching, and were transferred to a brooder heated by a bright-
emitter infra-red lamp, together with one or two bantam chicks that had
been hatched at the same time. It was thought that the bantam chicks
would exercise a quiet restraint on their companions and encourage them
to feed. They did have a quietening effect on the guinea-fowl, but in
each case the guinea-fowl started feeding of their own accord within
seconds of being put in the brooder. They were given small maggots,
turkey starter crumbs and duckweed (Lemna miner). At four weeks they
were put on turkey growers pellets, and corn was introduced to their diet
at six weeks.
Vulturine chicks are yellowish-buff, with finely marked dark brown
pencilling on the head and nape, as can be seen in the photograph. The
bill and legs are flesh-coloured. Almost from birth they emit, when
frightened, a miniature edition of the " churring " warning call of the
adult. Blue feathers appear on the breast at 8 weeks, but the down on the
head is not replaced by baldness until they are over 16 weeks old.
The first breeding of Vulturine Guinea-Fowl in this country was by
J. C. Parr in 1884. Since then, to the best of my knowledge, the only
other successful breeder has been W. R. Partridge, in Worcestershire, who
reared more than 30 between 1962--64. Unfortunately, he lost more than
half of his first clutch from gape-worms and blackhead, and subsequently
experienced leg weakness at 10--16 weeks. This was apparently partially
rectified by including limestone grit and cod-liver oil in the diet. As my
chicks have had both from an early age, I hope to avoid this trouble.

A. J. CLARE--BREEDING THE YELLOW-BACKED LORY
A number of interesting points emerge from Partridge's breeding
records, viz.:
He has had eggs as early as May.
He, too, has experienced egg-eating by the birds.
The incubation period he records is 27-28 days, four days longer than
mine.
On at least two occasions the hen guinea-fowl successfully hatched and
reared her own young. Not only did the cock bird frequently brood
the chicks during the day, but it was for him only that the young
birds fed for the first few days.
Considering the very large numbers of Vulturine Guinea-Fowl kept in
zoos and private collections in this country, it is surprising that so few
breeding records have been achieved. There must obviously be certain
basic requirements to their breeding in captivity, and from my very

limited experience I tentatively put forward three factors:
(1) They must be given a sizeable pen, not less than 50 square yards,
and preferably much larger. (Partridge has had good results in a
J-acre orchard.)
(2) Plenty of grass is essential, and the addition of live insects to their
diet is important.
(3) Their feet are extremely susceptible to frost, and they must be
given adequate protection in the winter.

I purchased a pair of Yellow-backed Lories in the spring of 1967. They
were placed in an aviary 16 ft. x 6 ft. x 4 ft. wide. They settled down
very well and became very tame, coming to the wire for titbits of apples,
bananas, etc. Food was placed in a shelter attached to the end of the
aviary, which also had a large nest-box in which they slept. They wintered
very well, with no ill effects, and showed no discomfort at the cold and
damp of their first English winter.
In March 1968 I added a large hollow log, approx. 2 ft. 6 in. round,
20 in. deep, inside which was 4 in. of peat, sawdust and shavings. They
took to the log immediately, going in and out all the time and deserting
their earlier nest-box. Eventually I discovered two eggs, white, and
resembling pigeon's eggs. Both birds seemed to share incubation. The
laying date was not known, but the eggs were found on 14th May; and

on 27th June two chicks were discovered. It was too dark to distinguish
much in the log. Both adult birds were very excited and would display
all the time by the entrance to the nest-log. I was informed that to rear
Lories plenty of mealworms, maggots, fruit and seed were necessary.
These I supplied, but the parent birds left it all and continued to feed the
chicks on a mixture which I make for them from Complan, Farlene,
Robinson's Baby-rice, sugar, condensed milk, and Bovril. I feed my
twelve pairs of Lories and Lorikeets on this mixture and none of these
birds will now take fruit or seed.
By the 1 ith July the chicks had grown quite a bit, and although the eyes
were not open feather quills covered the body. If, as I have read, the
chicks are naked for the first three weeks, then these young might be about
five weeks old. On ist August the young had their eyes open, quills
opening to deep red feathers, and the body more covered in red down.
The bills were black. On 16th August yellow feathering was showing on
the back. The parent birds remained very tame and were not bothered
by my looking at the chicks. On 3rd September the young were peering
out of the entrance hole and on 16th September left the nest, full feathered
and very strong in wings and body.

If thirty-odd years of keeping birds have taught me anything, it is that
each and every bird, regardless of species, is an individual. This fact
becomes especially noticeable when one keeps a number of birds belonging
to the same species. Close observation soon reveals conspicuous differ-
ences of behaviour on the part of this or that member of the group. And
as one gets to know the various members better and better, one begins to
appreciate, as well as to respect, their distinctive traits more and more.
Being an individual and being also dependent for all his daily needs on
his keeper, a bird in cage or aviary deserves understanding treatment.
Such keeping calls for supplying him, first of all, with his fundamental
needs. To learn exactly what these needs are, the keeper should gather as
much factual information concerning the bird's native surroundings, food,
shelter, breeding and other essential aspects of his natural behaviour as he
can. Most public libraries are well stocked with good books and maga-
zines on birds of all kinds; there can, therefore, be little excuse for any
bird-keeper pleading ignorance of this subject. Moreover, visiting fellow
fanciers--actually seeing how they care for their charges and talking with
them--usually yields important and practical suggestions for the care of
one's own feathered flock. However, these suggestions should be applied

PROF. CARL NAETHER--UNDERSTANDING BIRDS IN CAPTIVITY
cautiously and gradually, since the conditions under which fanciers keep
birds vary decidedly.
Ordinarily, two groups of birds are kept in confinement--those imported
after their capture in the wilds of foreign countries and exported, and those
raised in captivity. Since the numbers of the latter do not usually meet the
ever-increasing demands by aviculturists, wild birds are being constantly
imported to make up the difference. By nature very shy and fearful of
man, their enemy, wild birds must receive humane treatment from the
very beginning of their keeping if they are to adjust themselves to life in
captivity. At all times they must be handled with gentleness and with
patience. Especially frightening to any bird, particularly a wild one, is
to be caught up with a net, having first been chased from pillar to post.
If an aviary bird is to be caught, it is best to catch him in a trap that is
suitably baited. The caught bird should be held in the right hand by
simply placing one's forefinger gently but firmly around his neck and
against one's thumb. Under no condition should a bird ever be held by
the wings or any part of his body be squeezed tightly, since it is so easy to
injure birds, especially smaller ones. Most birds dislike being held by
human hands. Since the experience shocks them, they should be sub-
jected to it only when absolutely necessary. It is always best to leave
captive birds alone (except, of course, those especially trained) just as
much as possible so that they may live as contentedly as their confinement
permits.
Before one places a bird in either cage or aviary for the first time, his
new home should be in complete readiness, with everything needful for
his welfare provided, so that he will not have to be disturbed for some time.
Since he is already made nervous by being placed in new surroundings,
frequent fussing with him will only aggravate his condition. He should
be left alone--be given ample time to accustom himself to his strange
environment.
When attending to the wants of birds in aviaries, one should move about
slowly and deliberately. Any sudden movements frighten birds, and it
takes them some time to overcome fright. It is best always to follow a set
routine, which they will soon come to recognize and to expect. This
applies especially to feeding, which to this writer is the most delightful
daily chore of his hobby, since it brings him into fairly close contact with
his feathered friends. I make it a point to wear clothes of the same colour
whenever I go into my aviaries and to go about my tasks leisurely. My
birds recognize me on sight the moment I enter their abode, some of them
flying to my hand for titbits, others darting to the feed-dishes soon after I
leave.
Feeding time is a most propitious time for taming birds, for in their
eagerness to be fed they seem to forget their shyness of man. If you wish
to induce a bird to take food from your hand, then you should stand very
still, holding the food in your outstretched hand, and wait patiently for the

bird to approach. Depending on the kinds of birds you keep and the way
in which you treat them, more or less time will elapse before one or more
of them will come near you. It is very important that you let the bird
come to you, that ordinarily you do not go to him. Often repeated, this
simple procedure will soon be taken advantage of by the birds as an
opportunity to get titbits without fear of harm, with the result that in time
more and more birds will become reasonably tame and confiding. Many
bird enthusiasts, especially those keeping softbills, call to their birds at
feeding time, using the same phrase or phrases each time, and rewarding
those that obey the call with mealworms or other titbits. Once thoroughly
used to the call, they will come readily, even if they do not get something to
eat every time.
To learn to understand birds in captivity it is best to start with only a
few, unless, of course, one has had previous experience with them. A
pair of the handsome Pekin Robins, whose essential requirements are
comparatively simple, kept in a roomy cage or small aviary, will furnish
any amateur bird fancier with a delightful beginning and study. And if
perchance induced to breed, their family affairs, in particular their nest-
building and rearing of young to maturity, will provide a rich source of
unusual and often amusing enlightenment for both young and old. It
means having a small but lively and characteristic touch of nature right in
the home. Such a beginning serves as an excellent introduction to the
secrets of satisfactory bird-keeping, and one requiring but little expendi-
ture of effort, time and money.
Having gained valuable experience from this simple beginning, the bird-
keeper, if he be still enthusiastic over his project, can now enlarge it by
attempting to breed other species, whose needs, while often somewhat
different, are yet in many respects similar. Or, he may like a given species
so much as to want to study its habits more thoroughly over a period of
years. Which calls to mind a good friend who is so carried away with the
charm and the beauty of song of the European Blackbird that he has
indulged in breeding this lovely songster for many years, and with increas-
ing success and satisfaction. This pleasant concentration has yielded
him such a wealth of practical knowledge of the bird s behaviour and
requirements in captivity as to establish him an authority on the keeping
and breeding of European Blackbirds.
In this connection, I would recommend always a gradual and considerate
start with insectivorous and frugivorous birds, such as robins, thrushes,
flycatchers, tanagers, honeycreepers, and the like. These birds, which,
incidentally, have been my special pleasure for over 30 years, are much
easier to tame than most seedeaters. Theirs is an intriguing individuality,
manifesting itself in every important aspect of their behaviour. In fact,
some specimens show so much individuality that they become very
pleasing personalities, easily recognizable by their unique actions. Over
the years it has been my privilege to keep three Shama Thrushes, those

PROF. CARL NAETHER--UNDERSTANDING BIRDS IN CAPTIVITY
vivacious, excitable birds from far-off India, whose musical ability in
some instances rivals that of our best-singing mocking-birds. The last
Shama I had for well over io years. All three were tame and would readily
take mealworms from the hand. If any of them were caught up and
handled, they would shriek defiance. The first two I kept in a large cage
indoors, giving them the liberty of the room once a day; the third I kept
outdoors summer and winter. " Bobby ", the first one, a truly magni-
ficent bird with glossy plumage and beautiful long tail, began very soon
after arrival to imitate the barking of our cocker spaniel, as well as the
sounds of birds singing in the neighbourhood. Given the freedom of the
room, he would suddenly swoop down on the dog, trying to attack him.
Resenting this show of aggressiveness, the cocker would snap at the Shama.
The two never became friends. The second Shama, whom we called
" Mister ", not as fine a songster as the first one, paid practically no
attention to the cocker pups we had at the time, except to mimic their
barking almost perfectly. If in their playfulness they approached the high
stand on which the bird's cage rested closely, " Mister " would begin to
scold, the while whipping his long tail vigorously up and down. Let
loose in the room, he made no attempt to fly at the dogs who eyed him
curiously. Seemingly, they hardly existed for him. My third Shama
Thrush, whom we simply called " Shama ", I kept with a pair of Mountain
Witch Doves in an outdoor pen, where he enjoyed life for io years. An
accomplished mimic, his repertoire included the cackling of hens, the
barking of dogs, and some of the finest notes from an Indian Starling's
short melody. Whenever I went into his aviary, he would come near me,
all the while whistling and frolicking in lively fashion, as if displaying to a
prospective mate.
To birds accustomed to flying about at will in meadow, field or forest,
crowding is the worst punishment which any keeper can inflict on them.
Aside from being wholly unnatural, such treatment puts captive birds
constantly on the defence, since they have nowhere to escape and to relax.
Moreover, birds which are crowded together for any length of time,
whether in cage or aviary, soon develop strong tendencies to bully their
fellows and will often attack and even injure them seriously. Crowded
birds do not--cannot--act naturally. Assuredly, under such abnormal
conditions they will neither sing nor breed--two abilities which evidence
well-being and contentment.
Sympathetic treatment of birds in confinement demands roomy,
comfortable cages or aviaries in which they can at any time get quickly
out of the way of others of their kind and stay out of the way. Many of
today's manufactured cages, while ornamental, are in size and in other
practical avian requirements unsuited to house birds. It is surely no
exaggeration to assert that during the last 50 years American bird-cages
have been but little improved--a very good reason why genuine birdlovers

Duild their own cages and aviaries, often patterning them after English
md German models.
Kind and thoughtful treatment of captive birds demands also that if
members of different species are to be kept in the same enclosure they
must be congenial; otherwise, continued bickering and fighting will
prevent the occupants from acting naturally and from showing their best
in song, in plumage and in breeding. Certain species of softbills, being
gentle by nature, get along nicely with fellow occupants; other species,
being aggressive by nature and often known as troublemakers, cannot be
placed in mixed collections without running the risk not merely of
destroying the sociality of the whole group, but of causing vicious fighting
with consequent loss of life. In most cases, only judicious experiment
and very careful observation for several weeks can disclose which species
of birds may be kept together safely and harmoniously. In an aviary
6 ft. long, 6 ft. high and 10 ft. deep, planted with honeysuckle and leafy
shrubs, I have accommodated a mixed collection of softbills, including
honeycreepers, silver-eared mesias, blue-winged sivas, yuhinas, banana
quits, various tanagers, spectacled and other thrushes, and orioles, almost
all males and all living together peaceably and quite contentedly. It is
clear that if I had kept these birds not for singing and beauty of plumage
but for breeding, I would have been able to keep but very few pairs in the
same aviary, since at the beginning of nesting time the males would have
fought for their respective breeding territories.
Beginners especially have a stong tendency to overestimate the capacity
of their aviaries, adding more and more birds to their collections so that
very soon crowded conditions will prevail, making life for most occupants
miserable. Strangley enough, occasionally I have seen careless " pack-
ing " of birds into too much limited space in prominent zoos in this
country, whose facilities for keeping them should be models of modern
and thoroughly humane enclosures.
In all aviculture, it is well to remember that as natural, living entities,
birds are fully entitled to the very best possible treatment which we can
provide for them in confinement, and that ignorance and neglect of their
basic daily needs are to be avoided at all costs.

The Roadrunner ( Geococcyx californiana ) of south-western parts of
North America had never been represented in the collection until a pair,
bred at the San Diego Zoo and presented by the San Diego Zoo authorities,
arrived early in October. This cuckoo, as its name implies, is a swift
runner that may sometimes be seen along roads. Chaparral Cock is
another name and this derives from the type of country favoured by the
birds, for low-growing evergreen oak and other low vegetation is known as
chaparral. Reptiles are a favourite food of the Roadrunner, so much so
that it is often depicted with a lizard grasped in its beak: small mammals
and probably nestling birds, beetles, etc., are also eaten. It is said that the
Roadrunner is so swift and agile that it can outmanoeuvre a dog, and
Dresser wrote in 1865 that " when tamed, as these birds often are, they
become expert mousers, but are so mischievous as hardly to be suffered in
the house ". There are two species in this genus, the other, G. velox,
occurring in Mexico and parts of Central America.
A Black-billed Humming Bird (Chlorostilbon gibsoni melanorhynchus ),
presented by Mr. W. H. Brown, is another new species. It is also known
as the Green-fly and is certainly one of the smallest of the family. A
Little Bunting (Emberiza pusilla), presented by Mr. J. Trollope, is also a
new species. This is a rare vagrant to England, " about eleven "
being recorded in the 1946 edition of The Handbook of British Birds.
Two Grey Francolins ( Francolinus pondicerianus) from Mr. W. A.
Newlands, a pair of Pheasant-tailed Jacanas from Dr. K. C. Searle and
two Black-crested Finches (or Pigmy Cardinals) from Mrs. V. Whitaker
Carr are other presentations of particular interest and are species that have
not been in the collection for some considerable time. A pair of Brown-
necked Parrots ( Poicephalus robustus suahelicus), a pair of Green Broadbills
and two pairs of Fairy Bluebirds are other accessions of note.

To the Magazine, i960, January-February number, I contributed " On
Mandarin Duck Hybrids a summary of records of crosses in which the
Mandarin is reputed to have been one of the ducks involved. At that
time it was agreed by many of the foremost authorities that the Mandarin
possesses a number of chromosomes differing from that of all other
Anatidae. This fact was said to make hybridization extremely unlikely,
if not actually impossible.

Since then Paul A. Johnsgard has taken considerable pains to review
the literature, examine museum skins and locate living examples of
" possibles He makes known his findings in Bull. B.O.C ., 1968,
140-148. From these it appears that the Mandarin has crossed success-
fully, both ways, with the Carolina or Wood Duck, and with a male Laysan
Teal--all these hybrids relate to the U.S.A.

In the Magazine, 1968, 222-223, John Yealland reported the breeding
of the Tasmanian Waterhen Tribonyx mortieri at the London Zoological
Gardens. I thought this might be a first breeding but it appears that
success was obtained, albeit unknowingly, at the Bristol Zoo during 1967.
Curator G. R. Greed writes: " We imported six of these birds from
Basel Zoo in March, 1967. One of them died a few weeks later. Of the
remainder, one pair was kept in our Gardens in Clifton and bred, but the
youngsters were eaten by Sacred Ibis. The other three birds were
transferred to our Crane Sanctuary (on our country estate, near Bristol).
An abandoned nest was found and when we made a check in December,
1967 there were four birds. Therefore, we presume that one was hatched,
but because of the conditions we did not see it until it was fully grown.
As the birds were virtually free-range and not kept in the Zoo, we did not
report the breeding. Incidentally, in our Crane Sanctuary we have
five selected pairs--two Sarus, two Manchurian and one White-naped.
We succeeded in getting four pairs to nest and eleven eggs were laid.
Unfortunately only the Sarus proved fertile."

W. H. Collard, Director, Natal Zoological Gardens, South Africa,
writes: " During one of my visits to England I purchased a pair of Rufous-
necked Weavers, but despite many near-misses we were unable to breed
from them. Recently one of the keepers allowed the hen to escape into
an adjoining aviary. Rather than bring her back we decided to introduce
the cock bird into the fresh aviary. To our pleasant surprise, just over
a month later, we noticed a fledgling on the perch. And this after twelve
years, as they were purchased in 1956. Another interesting breeding is
that of two hybrid lorikeets. The male parent was a Forsten's and the
female a Scaly-breasted x Forsten's. The hybrid female (seen by Mr.
Yealland during his recent visit to our Gardens) is very much like a
Scaly-breasted, except for some orange flecks on the breast and a slight
resemblance of the Forsten's collar. The two young ones are green, but
with much brighter breasts than their female parent, and light blue heads,
very similar to an Edwards' Lorikeet.

" Other hatchings have been three Black Crakes, six Silver Pheasants,
two Mallards, five Carolina Ducks, five Plum-headed Parrakeets, three
Superb Starlings, and some Masked, Rosy-faced and Fischer's Lovebirds."

We were able only to establish that the smallest parrot is any one of
several species of Micropsitta , measuring a little over 3 in. in length
(1968, 225).
It is perhaps a little unfair to ask museum workers to decide which is the
largest parrot. In the skinning process several inches could unintentionally
be added to the length of the larger parrots. Also it does rather depend on
what one means by the largest. If the size is to be judged by total length
then it must surely be the Red and Yellow or Scarlet IVIacaw Ara macao
which measures about 36 in* Followed by the Red and Blue Ara
chloroptera and the Hyacinthinus Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus, both of
which measure some 34 iti, but if size is to be based on actual body size
then possibly one of the five races of the Great Black Cockatoo Probosciger
aterrbnus would take pride of place. Incidentally, these cockatoos
measure 29-31 in. overall, so they rank quite high in this respect.
Colin Harrison has measured a number of museum specimens and says
that if one subtracts the tail measurements one gets the following lengths
for body and head:
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.4817706" page_id="58089347"  page_num="36" year="" vol="">
P. aternmus , 19-21 in.
A. hyacinthinus , 14 in.
A. macac , 13 in.
A. chloroptera , 13 in.
Possibly total live weight might be the best criterion.

THE BOOK OF BIRD-WATCHING. By R. M. Lockley. London:

It is interesting to note that bird-watching has now become established
as an outdoor sport or occupation for young people and the present volume
is one of a series, each written by an expert in his field. No one better
could have been chosen for bird-watching than R. M. Lockley who has
devoted his whole life to the subject and established the first British Bird
Observatory in 1933 on the Welsh island of Skokholm. I he present
work contains chapters on how to make useful notes and permanent
records, on counting birds and how to identify each species by its appear-
ance, flight, voice and habits. The author describes in simple language
the psychology of a bird's mind, bird song, the nesting season, territorial
behaviour, migration and navigation, and his book should appeal to begin-
ners of any age. There are 29 illustrations and a cover design by
Behram Kaparia. E. H.

'STIMULITE' NECTAR FOOD is a COMPLETE NUTRI-
TIONAL food in highly concentrated form. It is highly
beneficial to all livestock, whether it be Humming Birds,
Sun Birds or other Nectarines, Insectivorous Birds, Fruit-
eaters, Canaries, Finches, Parrakeets, Parrots, or any kind
of animal. This supreme food should be available to
them at all times.
Recently there has been some advocacy of a sugar and protein diet for
Humming Birds, such a diet is very deficient in nutritional value.
PROTEIN is produced within the body by METABOLISM from the
nutrients in the food consumed. A diet, to be fully nutritional, has to
contain all the essential vitamins. A, D, E, C, and the full vitamin B
Complex, Bl, B 2 , B6, B 12 (known as the animal-protein factor), the full
context contains Thiamin, Riboflavine, Nicotinic Acid, Pantothenic Acid,
Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Inositol, Choline and Biotin. Only a food
containing all of these can be termed COMPLETE.
Metabolism can only convert the food into protein if the food also
contains the following amino acids : Arginine, Histidine, Lysine,
Trypotophane, Phenylalanine, Methionine, Leucine, Isoleucine and
Valine. All these factors are necessary for a fully nutritional food, they
are not hearsay, but SCIENTIFIC FACTS which can be verified.

(Balearica pavonina)
By Dr. H. W. Clarke and Dr. L. Amadei (Ravenna, Italy)
In 1953 my good friend, Dr. Luigi Amadei of Ravenna, bought from
. Busacchi of Bologna, a well-known importer of exotic animals, a pair
Black-necked Crowned Cranes [Balearica pavorina). The male bird,
)wever, died of paralysis some five years later, and was replaced by
lother male of the same species, considerably more handsome and better
jveloped, which had been in the possession of a private collector in
plogna for almost ten years.
I now record the words of Dr. Amadei, who has very kindly agreed, at
y request, to give some particulars on the breeding he obtained together
ith some previous observations.
: " In 1967 I noticed that the male of my pair of Crowned Cranes was
turting the female, and according to what my housekeeper told me, had
tually fertilized her.
" Later, during that summer, the female laid three eggs, which were
t upon by the male and female birds alternately, in a nest roughly
instructed on the ground with boughs and dry leaves, by some wire
;tting separating one of my chicken-runs and a privet hedge. After
&amp;gt;out a fortnight, the eggs were inspected and unfortunately turned out
be infertile.
" This year f 1968) I did not notice any signs of courtship or fertilization,
owever, the female laid, in the old nest, a first egg on 15th July, a second
1 17th July, and a third and last on 19th July. I must admit that I did
)t attach much importance to this brood, first of all because I had already
-en disappointed by the laying of the previous year, and then because the
ace where the Cranes had laid was continuously disturbed by workmen,
rries, etc., because in my country house--situated in the Municipality
Cotignola in the Province of Ravenna, where the two birds are kept--
pairs were being made to the walls and central heating installed. All
is, naturally, considerably disturbed the female while she was sitting on
e eggs and she went away from the nest several times. In spite of all

this, on 17th August, at an interval of some two hours, two chicks hatched;
the third egg had mysterously disappeared before the two chicks were
hatched. For all the investigations made, the mystery of its disappearance
was never cleared up.
"A few hours after hatching, the parent birds took the two chicks for a
walk in a meadow in front of my house; this meadow was where the paii
usually stayed.
" Right from the first, I noticed that one of the chicks was not growing
at all: it tottered and was neglected by the parent birds, perhaps becaust
it was less lively, and it was not fed as frequently as the other. This,
chick survived eight days only. The other one, on the other hand
developed normally and at the time of writing (20th October 1968) is
almost as tall as its mother. Many photographs of the young bird, at
various stages, were taken by my friend, Dr. H. W. Clarke of Rome. "
Habitat
The young bird grew up and developed in a meadow in front of th&amp;lt;
country house of Dr. Amadei; the meadow is partly planted with trees
firs, juniper, thuya and Pinus pinea. The rest of it is a natural meadov
with a few bushes here and there. The area of this meadow is ca. 1,00c
square metres; part of it is fenced off with wire netting, part is contiguous
with the house, and part with a boundary wall which separates the meadov
from the neighbouring property.

As this is a particularly important subject, which undoubtedly has had ;
favourable influence on the growth and development of the chick, I agaii
report the words of Dr. Amadei, who writes as follows:
" I was able to ascertain that the parent birds brought, even from thei
usual habitat, various insects for food (Diptera, Orthoptera, etc.). I believe
however, that the food consisted for the most part of small earthworms
In my opinion this food has had the greatest influence on the survival an&amp;lt;
subsequent growth of the chick. As usual with these birds, the food wa
not pushed down the young bird's throat, but offered to it, and it took am
swallowed it. As I had neither live nor frozen insects at my disposal,
had to supplement the food, in order to round off the nourishment of th
young bird adequately, with larvae of " meat flies " (which are for sale fo
the use of anglers): bread and milk, balanced animal food, minced ox hearl
small fish and a mixture of insect-eating birds.
" The morsels most acceptable to the young Crane in the first perio
were the larvae of meat flies and bread and milk, in addition, of course, t
the insects the parent birds got for it.
" When about 50 days old, the young bird started to feed also on cereak
especially green rice and grain. It is very fond of mole crickets an
grasshoppers, which however I have difficulty in getting.

" Today, when over two months old, the young bird has its body to a
;ood part covered with feathers, and the remiges and retrices are already
isible. At the back of the head a protuberance can be noted, announcing
he coming of the characteristic golden tuft of the Crowned Cranes."
After these interesting notes of Dr. Amadei, I have to add that a not
legligible part of the result obtained is due to him: the care, attention and
&amp;gt;assion Dr. Amadei lavishes on his Crowned Cranes are, I believe, more
inique than rare. And these birds of his--which I have often seen enter
ven their owner's house--have lost their wild state completely and seem
o know and love the man who cares for them so well.
I took a few photographs of the young bird when it reached the age of
o days. It enjoys perfect health.

Ruff, Philomachus pugnax , bred at the New York Zoological Park in
968, and observations were made on their growth rate. Ruff have bred
arely in captivity and this may have been the first time they have bred in
forth America.
In March 1968 ten adult birds, four ruffs and six reeves, which arrived
t the Zoo 12th April 1967* were placed in the " Lagoon " scene of the
aquatic Bird House. The Lagoon is 53 feet long and 24 feet wide, with
early one fourth of this area consisting of a large irregular pool. The
ubstrate is sand (fine beach sand or white quartz) except for the three foot
ide planter along the back and side walls which contains soil. Pittosporum
)bira is the major background plant. With a few Ficus nitida and
fontia Palm trees it helps hide the exhibit walls. Skylights over the
ntire exhibit supply all of the light that the exhibit receives. Other birds

D. F. BRUNING-BREEDING OF THE RUFF
The ruffs were fed twice a day, at 9.00 a.m. and 3.00 p.m. Feed consisted
of a mix for soft-billed birds, hard-boiled egg, chopped horsemeat,
chopped butterfish, Vitamycin and Caradee. No peculiarities of feeding
were observed. Cage temperature is maintained above 50* during the
winter and it varies upward during the spring and summer or on any
bright day as more heat comes through the skylights. Day length varies
seasonally due to natural lighting.
During May and June much breeding activity was observed and all four
ruffs displayed. No true " lek " formed although the males displayed
prominently and showed definite lek behaviour even though a true lek
was not possible due to the other birds in the exhibit.
On 26th June 1968 four newly hatched downy chicks were seen being
brooded by their mother. The nest had gone unobserved during incu-
bation because it was located within the thickest background plantings.
The display grounds were within the largest open area of the exhibit about
a third of the way from the left end of the exhibit and about midway
between the pool and the back wall. The nest was located nearly ten feet
away. The reeves all used the planted areas to hide in as did a couple of
subdominant ruffs.
A pair of Black-winged Stilt, Himantopus h. himantopus , which had just
lost two of their chicks, was observed trying to claim the four ruff chicks on
26th June. The reeve attempted to protect her chicks, but was unable to
withstand the stilts' attacks. For protection, the reeve and her chicks
were moved into a separate cage. The reeve accepted the new surround-
ings and started brooding the chicks almost immediately. A heat lamp was
placed above the birds in case the disturbed reeve failed to brood.
The chicks possessed extremely long legs and toes in proportion to the
rest of their bodies. The following measurements were taken from two
of the chicks and from the adult reeve on 28th June:

The chicks started eating small bits of fish and horsemeat, hard-boiled
egg and mealworms when they were two days old. When they were
eight days old and the reeve became aggressive toward them and had to be
removed from the cage. After the removal of the reeve the chicks
continued to grow rapidly. As they approached adult size it became
evident that three were ruffs and one was a reeve.

By Mrs. B. M. Marsault (Exmouth, Devon, England)
In 1968 a pair of Guillemots, Uria aalge , laid an egg at the Bird Hospital,
run by my husband and myself, at which seabirds were being rehabilitated.
The history of the two individuals concerned is briefly as follows:
COCK BIRD (from notes kept, 14th November 1964 to 27th August 1966.) |
14 th November 1964--Admitted, having been picked up at Budleigh J
Salterton, oiled all down from breast to tail and vent. In winter plumage.
Bird totally exhausted and unable to stand and very weak. Was force-fed
at first with difficulty. Washed in pure soap flakes solution and rinsed t
copiously.
15 th November --Bird fed all day by picking up small herring fillets
when thrown in front of him. Walking a few steps on the whole of the
foot before flopping forwards. Continued to walk like this for three days
before spending longer periods upright, started taking fish from forceps.
20 th November --Started walking on toes for short periods, feeding well. j
21 st November --Swam in the bath but became quickly waterlogged..
Fed well until 28th November when he was not interested in fish.!
Intestinal antiseptic given in capsules. Ate hardly anything for three days.;
Capsules continued.
2 iid December --Feeding better, taking herring fillets and sprats.
16 th December-- Started taking fish from a dish of sea water. Diet
supplemented with vitamins.
Progress continued uneventfully. It had a bath every other day. Fe
well, taking up to 28 sprats a day. Weight constant at 1 lb. 14 oz. to 1 lb.
15 oz. Very tame, his best friend w r as our Alsatian dog from whom he
hated to be parted. He became waterproof 18 months after admission
and moulted into summer plumage in July 1966 for first time.
April 1965--Several other oiled Guillemots arrived.
HEN BIRD (from notes kept 14th May 1966 to 29th August 1966).
Picked up oiled in Cornwall in January 1966 and transferred to the
Exeter R.S.P.C.A. clinic by road. The conditions here were appalling
Surviving birds were sent by road to another R.S.P.C.A. centre nead
Taunton. By May 1966 the original number of oiled birds sent fronr
Cornwall to Exeter and then Taunton, which had numbered 250, hac
dwindled to eight. The eight birds were taken to the coast in May foi
release, but two of them refused to go and were taken back to Tauntor
where one died within 24 hours and we were asked to take the iemainin^
bird which was admitted here on 14th May. The bird was in fairly goo(j
condition but not waterproof. It was hand fed. Weight in May 1 lb
9 oz. Extra vitamins given. Good progress. Weight in August 1 lb
njoz. Settled with other convalescent Guillemots and one Razorbill
Alca torda.
The birds were put out in the garden during the day but always brough
into the house at night until 1st September 1966 when they were installer

in a pen on the lawn, size 10 x 10 ft. with a small plastic children's paddling
pool containing fresh water. Covered sleeping quarters 10 x 5 ft. opened
off the pen, the door of which was shut every night. The birds are still in
this pen but the grass has been replaced by beach sand. Two enclosures
are now used. The depth of sand varies. One group of Guillemots and
Razorbills have deep sand in their outer run, and shallow sand in their
sleeping quarters; the other group live on shallow sand in both compart-
ments. Both enclosures have small freshwater pools.
The birds go into their sleeping quarters about an hour before nightfall,
of their own free will, and are frequently in there during the day. The
door is shut because the other enclosure is open to the sky, and cats or
other creatures could easily disturb or harm the birds. The wire-netting
covered frames which enclose the outer run are 4 ft. high and it is not
infrequent to find a Guillemot standing on top of this or walking about on
the thick plastic-covered roof of the sleeping quarters! Sometimes we
find one of them outside the pen, running up and down, trying to find a
way through the wire-netting. It never seems to occur to them to fly back
inside, but it is always evident that they are glad to be back with the others,
when we replace them.
The birds are now fed exclusively on sprats, which we buy directly from
the trawlers at Exmouth or Teignmouth. My husband then sorts and
packs them into plastic bags holding 3 lbs. (this saves waste) and then they
ire put into the freezer. Before using, we allow the fish to thaw naturally,
md they are given to the Guillemots and Razorbills in flat enamel dishes
lolding sea water. We allow on average 12 sprats per head per day, 6 in
:he morning and 6 in the evening. Sometimes they eat more; and they
nust be the right size, which is rather tedious, that is, not more than 4
inches long although they can be smaller. The dishes are left on the
ground and the birds help themselves. The other birds now in the pen
ire Guillemots--admitted April 1965, January 1966, April 1966, August
[966, February 1968; Razorbills--admitted January 1966, February 1968.
I have had some trouble with foot injuries and infections, but mostly
during the first eight weeks of treatment, before the birds are put out into
:he outdoor enclosures. The most important thing seems to be to provide
soft material for them to stand on, in the hope of preventing pressure sores
rom developing on the soles of their feet. We use thick plastic foam
sheeting, and the birds have frequent baths, which help to keep their feet
mpple. I have used various ointments to massage their feet, such as
deodorised cod liver oil cream. Sometimes I have had to keep a dressing
n place to prevent formation of a wound, or to protect a wound already
ormed. Trouble with overgrown beaks has only occurred with two birds.
)ne beak became very long and then broke or peeled off, but once I had to
&apos;ut the beak as it showed no sign of separating. Razorbills also shed a
ayer of their beaks, and I have seen the same thing with a shag and a
:ormorant. It seems as though a new beak is growing under the old one,

which is lifted up and then shed. If, however, the old beak is not shed
it continues to grow.
In May 1968 the cock and hen Guillemot in question were seen mating
on several occasions. At the same period a pair of Razorbills mated
frequently. These birds were Torrey Canyon victims. We had hopes
of a Razorbill egg, but in vain. A second pair of Guillemots also mated
fairly frequently, again without result. 1 he nesting data for the first pair
is as follows:
ist--2nd June --Hen bird appeared to be slightly off colour with slightly
ruffled feathers and eyes half shut some of the time.
3 rd June --Hen discovered with an egg about 3 p.m. and which had
certainly not been there before lunchtime. Hen looked rather exhausted
and all the other birds were very interested and gathered round the egg.
The cock bird was most attentive and brought fish to the hen. The egg
was laid in the sleeping quarters against one of the walls.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.95868425" page_id="58089407"  page_num="44" year="" vol="">
4 th June --Hen on egg apart from a short while morning and evening
when she left it to go into the pool and then preen her feathers. All birds
still very interested and the cock bird of another pair seen mating,
constantly chivvying the cock with the egg.
5 th June --Hen off egg morning and evening for a short while to bathe
preen and feed. Bird looked normal again. Others slightly less interested.
Cock still attentive.
6 th June --Hen off egg for about three hours from 10.30 to 1.30 p.m.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.880464727272727" page_id="58089407"  page_num="44" year="" vol="">
Meanwhile the cock fussed around the egg, sometimes with one foot on it,
looking as though he ought to do something about it. Hen back on egg
1.30 p.m. and remained for the rest of the day. Cock bird kept bringing
her offerings of fish, twigs, leaves, and feathers. These he brought from
anywhere in the outer or inner enclosure, and it was not a question of
simply moving something from one side of the egg to the other, but the
egg was nearly always surrounded by these offerings. W e do not think
that this had anything to do with nest building, but were brought as gifts.
This theory would seem to be supported by the fact that fish were brought
more often than leaves, twigs.
7th June --Hen on egg all morning, off for a short period in the afternoon
to bathe, preen and feed, then sitting for the rest of tne day.
%1hJune--As yesterday. Egg now surrounded by gifts brought by the cock.
9 th June --Hen off egg mid morning to bathe preen and feed and the
cock was very busy trying to arrange the egg under him, and he took a'
great deal of trouble to get it in the right place. He then sat on it for a
short while, but as soon as he left it the hen obviously encouraged him to
return, accompanied him back to the egg and supervised his reinstallatior
on the egg. A short while later the egg was seen to have been turneo
round and left in the direct sunlight and neither bird incubated it for a
short period. The hen then returned to sit for the rest of the day.
10 th June --Cock on the egg mid-morning for 15 to 20 minutes. During

the afternoon the cock was seen with a fish in his beak and trying to get
the hen to let him take over the incubation. He finally succeeded after
much growling and grunting. The hen, however, remained to see that
the cock was properly installed before she went off to bathe and preen
after which she returned and took over the egg once again.
11 th June Hen off egg for a short while at lunch time and the cock was
making vague efforts to sit on it but was too busy trying to give it a sprat
which he repeatedly dropped onto it, picked up and tried again and again.
The hen returned to sit until late afternoon when the egg was uncovered
for about three quarters of an hour.

MRS. E. L. MOON--KEEPING COCKATOOS AND COCKATIELS
lst July--Egg seen away from the usual site in sleeping quarters but was
brought back by the hen and incubated. Some while later egg was seen
again down the far end of the sleeping quarters and unattended and so
was picked up and found to be cracked # of the way round and completely
empty. Hen continued to look for the egg for several hours, then joined
the cock and other birds, went in the pool, preened and settled down to the
pre-egg routine. Several hours later the hen was seen ' incubating ' an
imaginary egg, in her usual position, for at least an hour.
yth i July _This morning we found at the nest site several fish and several
leaves, presumably brought by the cock, who has obviously not forgotten
the egg and is still bringing his gifts!

By Mrs. E. L. Moon (Miami, Florida, U.S.A.)
I was so kindly asked by your secretary for something for your magazine,
and I would like to air a few pet peeves at the makers of cages for these
birds. When I began raising my baby Cockatiels I felt there was no cage
on the market fit for them. The most important thing is horizontal wires
instead of vertical! With the ordinary parrot cage vertical wiring with
only one or two horizontal stay wires the birds get their heads out above
the stay wire and then cannot hold on to the vertical wires tight enough
with the feet to climb up and loosen the head. The owners come home
and find the bird hanging dead. If you only knew the number of letters
I have received on this, since I answered the Cockie Question and Answei
Column in "All Pets " you would not blame me for growling, and wishing
I could smash every one of such things. Then there are those tall rounci
ca g es --women buy them--so that the bird doesn t take up so much
house-room. One I have seen does have the wire going round it, but is
shaped like an ice-cream cone for all the wires to catch the droppings anc
no clean floor space for food. The other is like a vertical tube, some or
12 in. or 15 in. in diameter. Now what good does a bird get, even &amp;lt;
parakeet, from that? It cannot fly straight up such a thing--you migh
just as well have a little 12 in. x 12 in. canary cage. And in these als(
the food is so easily contaminated. I was recently sent a picture of on&amp;lt;
of my baby cockies on a cage, and it was one I had not seen, like a Chinesi
lantern. It did not look too comfortable, with the wires so close togethe
and not enough food containers.
So if I were a cage maker I would make a cage of five pieces, four side
and a top with a minimum of 2 ft. long, 2 ft. high, 18 in. wide. [I woul&amp;lt;
say that this was too small, see Avicultural Magazine, 72 , pp. y 12
Asst. Ed.] There should always be four cups for food and they shouU
be parrot-size--one for sunflower seed, one for small seed, one for watei
and one for soft food, and these should be fixed to the sides, otherwis

you have to set dishes on the floor of the cage to be dirtied on and a
nuisance to remove and clean. I do not like cups held in by plastic guards
since the bird can chew these and pull them up, spilling the food, but
plastic cups themselves are O.K. All four can be fitted across the front
of the cage making it easier to care for them. For the door it is nice to
have a drop door that forms an alighting platform. A swing in the cage is
O.K.., most cockatoos like it. I like the perches arranged so that they
are not over one another. 1 hree perches and a swing are enough. A
little dish may be hung inside for grit, it is no use wasting it on the floor.
I use paper on the floor, and always cut plently beforehand--to last a
week or ten days--and roll one out each day, rather than fold and fix daily.
But the main thing is the horizontal wires to save dear little lives.
For the big birds I use a perch. This can have a square base, or one
curved side, and fits into a corner but with castors for easy rolling. The
base is of three-quarter inch plywood with metal sides for 18 in. or so to
&apos;'top the birds climbing up, high enough so that the bill cannot reach the
op. A tree or a pole with a number of perches set at angles is fixed in the
-entre of the base with nice cedarwood shavings on the floor, very easy
:o clean and do not need it often. Food and water dishes on the floor.
This way you can walk up and pet your bird without pulling him out of a
loor and upsetting him. I usually cut all birds wings--not like an old
chicken but so that it looks pretty when closed but gives some chance
&amp;gt;f catching it if it gets out. I cut the outermost two primaries, leave the
lext three, then cut the remainder of the primaries and some secondaries
eaving the secondaries nearest to the body intact, and taking care not to
:ut the greater coverts which hide the cut bases.
I have nothing fancy and have made most of my cages, pens and nest-
x)xes myself. For the big birds I use mostly metal trash cans; with
)penings at both ends, the need for which I learned the hard way having a
ockatoo male drive " his hen to nest--and kill her there. I tried
vooden nail kegs--only to have a hole chewed in them and the eggs on
he floor when about ready to hatch. And I never use a tall nest-box,
aying the trash cans down instead of standing them upright as when a
&amp;gt;ig baby is all spread out on the bottom, especially where there is more
han one, a parent often jumps down and breaks a wing. The long cans
&amp;gt;n their sides give ample room for both parents and any number of babies
o walk about. The birds do not care if they are not pretty and I always
ay about their house and my own as well (I keep about 35 birds in my
&amp;gt;edroom) if visitors do not like it they need not stay so long--or come
*ack so soon.
I live for my birds--loved them all my life--so much that mother
sed to say if ever I had children and they had no feathers she feared I
'*uld not like them. Well I did raise two little girls, and am now past
eventy-four and great-grandmother of five, and I love them all! I cannot
" e very well today and had to be in bed most of the day so please forgive
ie notes--but I tried--anything for the birds.

AN AFTERNOON'S BIRDING IN RHODESIA

<bodyText confidence="0.9957555" page_id="58089411"  page_num="48" year="" vol="">
By D. M. Reid-Henry (Woodford Green, Essex, England)
Twenty miles or so to the north east of Salisbury just off the IVltokx
road there is a farm surrounded by rocky hills and bush. On this farm al
the usual Rhodesian crops are grown and the land is irrigated by wate
from a dam thrown across a stream to form a small lake of about six acre
in area.
It was in September or early in October i960 when I first visited thi
farm, and I returned several times at different seasons, for it was ai
enchanting place with a wealth of interest for a naturalist.
On the frowning rock kopjes that backed the homestead there was
resident Lanner falcon who had developed the bad habit of raiding th
farmer's domestic ducklings. He had tried to shoot her, and altnougi
she had then so far eluded him I feared the days of her depredations wer
numbered, and unless she mended her ways she would one day lose he
luck and her life.
The day I have in mind, I arrived after a drive from town with packe
lunch and tea and after calling on the farmer's family went down to th
dam a mile below the house.
The lake above the dam was not particularly interesting. There wer
occasional sand-pipers and small waders on its muddy surroundings and
Coot or two on the water. A Black Tern in its winter plumage beat il
seemingly lazy way to and fro over the lake surface seeking some mors&amp;lt;
of aquatic life to eat. The sun was hot and the air beginning to take 0
that oppressive character that precedes the coming of the rains. Ottei
used this lake as I deduced from the presence of a " slide ", but I do n(
think their comings had been noted or someone would have soon tried t
catch or shoot them. These animals are not very popular on priva 1
waters because they eat the fish and water creatures which attend to tf
mosquito problem.
On one side of this lake the land was somewhat marshy with a fe
young fig trees standing on the drier hillocks. Here the grass was coan
and gave good shelter to quails, francolins and, at this time of the ^e&amp;lt;
crakes and other skulking secretive birds. The other side, which w"&apos;
most conveniently reached by crossing via the dam-wall, was woodt
with a mixture of brachystegia bush, acaciae and various other fairly lari
trees. Of undergrowth there was little but the grass grew tall and yellowe
at the end of the dry season. Beyond this belt of woodland the groun
became rocky, and one had to begin scrambling up the sloping rock sic
of a granite hill which rose about two hundred feet on average above tl
farmland below. Brightly coloured lizards, disturbed from their baskii
in the sun on the naked rock scampered speedily away to the safety of
crevice, and far above in the rich blueness of the sky, a Black-breastc

iarrier-eagle circled on still wings watching the ground below for some
mwary snake to provide a meal by getting caught! On these granite
tills, or kopjes, vegetation is sparse, and somewhat of a different character
\0x25BAecause the soil is only deep enough in hollows and clefts to support the
row th of trees. Natural dents of shallow nature show a growth of mosses
nd where a small pool can form the grass may grow strongly in its
nvironment until the soil gives out on to bare rock again. Aloes put
heir roots down into cracks, and stunted low thorn bushes are to be found
round the bases of " candleabra trees ", or Euphorbia.
On one of the limbs of this bush I found a tangle of rubbish hung on a
horn. This would not have been noticed at all except that on my passing
lose by, a tiny bird flew out of the " rubbish " and investigation showed
to be the home of a Little purple-banded Sunbird Cinnyris bifasciatus.
But the most rewarding place on this farm from a bird-watching point
f view lay just below the dam wall. The wall itself was about fifty yards
&amp;gt;ng and made of banked earth reinforced with concrete slabs. The
uice gate let the water into a network of shallow streams and these met
bout fifty or sixty yards below to form again the single watercourse that
robably had been there before the dam was made. Here then was a
)ugh triangle of well-watered ground of a third or half an acre with a
ne array of big trees and a fairly thick undergrowth of bushes. At the
me of which I write, fortune arranged that a very popular fig tree was in
uit and the wealth of birds that came uninvited to the feast was an
ffculturists dream of delight. There were several Black-collared
arbets Lybnis torquatus , a pair of Amethyst Starlings Cinnyricinclus
ucogaster , a Broad-billed Roller Eurystomus glaucurus, a pair of Meyer's
arrots Poicephalus meyeri , (whose nest I found in a hollow tree two
undred yards away) as well as four species of sunbirds who were gorging
iemselves on a rich harvest of small caterpillars in the top canopy of a
11 mountain acacia tree. Two European rollers Cor arias garrulus were
i evidence shortly down the stream, and a newly arrived flock of European
ee-eaters Merops apiaster (of which the seeming majority were young
rds of the year) were desporting themselves from a dead tree that stood
vay from this small patch of dense bush. I could hear the " snick "
their beaks quite clearly as they arrested small insects passing by
eir look-out tree. A Striped Kingfisher Halcyon cheliculi was occupied
ith the murder of a large green grasshopper on a rock which stood out
the grass nearby, whilst the whimsical noises of a Purple-crested
ourie Gallirex porphyreocephalus were heard from time to time.
But the cream was still to come: a thin shrill piping was heard approach-
es from the lake, and then within fifteen yards of my head a tiny Malachite
ingfisher Corythornis cristatus perched with a small fish in its beak. It
is at once greeted by four young Kingfishers which I had not seen,
mded over its booty to the nearest of its brood, and flew away. The

young Kingfishers showed no alarm as I came closer, but remained per-
fectly silent and still and I watched them for some minutes before my
attention was turned elsewhere.
As I was retracing my way from this rewarding introduction I noticed a
Heuglin's Robin Cossypha heuglini slip away from the top of a dead tree
stump on which grew a profusion of moss and vegetation. Upon investi-
gation I found a nest with four gaping young within! I decided to leave
the place immediately because the bird would not return if I remained in
sight, and tempting though the discovery was, there was such a plethora
of interesting birds about I could well afford to take myself away. I
would return another day: such a place as this would richly repay manv
visits, and I had plenty of time to devote.
This day's outing came soon after my arrival in Rhodesia, and it was
not very long before I went to many other places every bit as pleasant and
interesting. As I have said, I did go back on several occasions during
the next eighteen months, and whilst my first thrills remain in my memory
very vividly, there were so many other trips to places where the scenery
was different and grander that it is hard to express an opinion as to whether
this early sortie was better or poorer than others from a birding viewpoint.
The whole country of Rhodesia offers such valuable returns for the
student of wild birds that one cannot easily state a preference for any one
area. What I find particularly pleasing is that everywhere one is con-
fronted with variety. Are you interested in sunbirds? go to Inyangt
in the Eastern highlands when the aloes are in bloom! Birds of prey?-
you will see them anywhere. Waterfowl?--any small farm dam will hav&amp;lt;
something to show, and when the traveller has used up all his time and &amp;lt;
sizeable lump of his resources, there will yet be other, possibly bette
places still to visit, and one can never know if next time one s experience
will outshine all that went before. Africa is never a bore!

recounted, nesting took place twice during 1967 when the first chick live
for 21 days and the second for 10 days. In 1968 the first two eggs wer
broken, the chick from the third nest lived for only a few days, and, whe
all hope had been abandoned for that season, the mother added a litt
material to the nest and at last succeeded in rearing a chick.

Ahat we observed except for the violent scenes and even murder. So far
rom killing her mate, our female was chased by him whenever she came
)ff the nest, so he was always removed as soon as the single egg was laid
ind incubation began. As already reported some nest reinforcement was
lecessary, but the mother was not at all discomposed by this. The chick,
1 fine strong bird, left the nest on the 27th day and was fed by the mother
or long after this. The food available to her was a substitute insectile
nixture, fruit, mealworms, maggots, locusts and, as already reported, her
avourite food--freshly killed mice, but so far as we could tell, for the food
ed by her to the chick was always regurgitated, mealworms were mostly
iffered to it. The mealworms were given in a dish containing the vitamin
md mineral supplement Vionate; bonemeal was also put onto the food, so
hat it is reasonably certain that the young one received some of these
terns.
This is the first of the Paradisaeidae to be bred in the Gardens.

The Grey-backed Thrush, Turdus dissimilis hortulorum , is a native of
astern Asia, breeding in north-eastern parts and wintering in south-eastern
Tina and parts of Indo-China. A second race lives in the area to the
outh-westward, including East Pakistan, Assam, Burma, northern Thai-
ind and parts of Indo-China. La Touche says that it is a bird of the
awer hills and plains and that its range in China is apparently restricted to
he maritime provinces; he also says, quite rightly, that it is a fine songster.
Dr. K. C. Searle sent a pair to us in December 1965 and one died during
he following autumn so he sent us a replacement in July 1967 and in the
pring of 1968 the first nest, composed largely of mud with some fine
rass built into it, was made about seven feet up on a window ledge.
Four chicks were reared by early June and they appeared to leave the
est early, urged to do so by the parents, we suspect, for immediately
nother clutch was laid in the same nest. These were hatched, but were
illed when a bird from the next aviary got into the thrushes' compart-
ment. The third clutch, also in the same nest, was then laid and two
hicks were fully reared. After this, we took away the nest, but a new
ne was soon built in the same place and eggs were laid but no chicks were
?ared.
The birds were fed on the substitute insectile mixture, together with
mealworms and cleaned maggots. The eggs are of a bluish-green colour
ith large reddish-brown spots and the six young birds proved to be one
male and five females.

In early November 1967, we received a pair of the Tasmanian Waterhen
or Native Hen (Tribonyx mortieri) which had been bred that year in the
Basel Zoo. They were put out on the Three-island Pond in the Spring
of 1968 and in August they nested, laying seven eggs of which two hatched
on the 5th September. ,
The nest was well hidden among plants growing close by the surrounding
moat and within a few feet of passing visitors. Moorhens live and breed
on the islands, but it is only occasionally that they are treated with any
hostility by their much larger and more powerful relatives; when the
chicks hatched the parents were rather more aggressive and sometimes
drove ducks as well as the Moorhens from the island; from which, to begin
with the chicks did not stray. The care of the chicks appeared to be
carried out in a casual way and not long after they hatched I saw, one
evening, both parents out in the middle of a nearby lawn as is their usual
habit, and I thought that the chicks must have died, but then, as if it had
just remembered something, one of the birds raced across the lawn and on
to the island where it re-appeared a few moments later with both chicks.
Evidently the young ones were sometimes left under the bushes, often
they were separated and as often as not away from the parents, though
just occasionally, and presumably at night, they were brooded.
Grass is a favourite food and as the adult waterhens are easily able to
cross the moat and to wander about the lawns and as in the rather wet
summer there was a plentiful growth of grass there was never any shortage.
In addition the birds can eat corn which is given to the waterfowl, biscuit-
meal and minced meat.
On the 6th October one chick died, but the other is now almost as large
as the parents. While the chicks were quite small a platform of vegetatior
was built by one or both parents at some distance from the nest and close
by the water's edge, but the birds were never seen to use it during the da)
though may have done so at night. The parents have nested, but un-
successfully, since their first attempt. Tribonyx mortieri has been bred or
a number of occasions at Basel, and if I remember rightly, a pair wit!
their family were wandering about the lawn in the Antwerp Zoo in th&amp;lt;
summer of 1964. Other European (and Australian) zoos have also beei
successful in breeding this species.

In April 1956 a tame West African Wood-owl (Ciccaba woodfordii
mchalis ) was received and ten years later three more from Liberia were
presented. All four have lived together ever since, being put into an
mtdoor aviary for the summer and brought into a slightly warmed place
or the winter.
In May 1968 one of the three birds made a scrape in a deep layer of peat
noss on the shelter floor and, so far as is known, only one egg was laid and
his duly hatched, though the precise incubation period is not known.
I he southern race is said to nest in the open hollow of a tree, or some
;imilar situation, and sometimes in an old nest of some large bird. We do
lot provide hollow logs or nesting-boxes for owls, for if we did the birds
vould roost in them and would never be seen, but in our experience even
he owls that nest in hollow trees will do so on the peat moss of the floor
ind, of course, the nest is screened by a sheet of hardboard as soon as
ncubation starts. Of the clutch size Mackworth-Praed and Grant say
)f the eastern and southern races " usually only one ", but Bannerman
,iays of the west African race " two would be the usual number laid ".
The tame bird, which is the smallest of the four, seems to have been the
ather, for it was sometimes standing by the nest. The remaining two
)irds, so far as is known, took no interest in the proceedings. The young
iird was of a pale buff-grey, browner on the back and with large whitish
pots on the outer scapulars; it was fully reared and is now in the San
)iego Zoo.
The main food of the birds is mice, but pieces of raw lean meat are

There are five races of Ciccaba woodfordii in forested parts of Africa and
n parts of Arabia and it is believed that this is the first breeding of the
pecies in this country.

In August 1948 a specimen of Magellan Eagle-Owl, Bubo virginianus
acurutu , was received from Paraguay and ten years later another was
ollected by Mr. David Attenborough on the B.B.C.'s Zoo Quest to
'araguay. On occasion in recent years the birds attempted to nest and a
ingle egg was laid each time, but was broken. This past year (1968),
owever, a successful nesting took place and a chick hatched and reared.

The nest was a scrape made in a deep layer of peat moss on the shelter
floor. A hardboard screen was fixed up as soon as the egg was laid and
incubation began, and no doubt this gave the mother a sense of seclusion
from the passing visitors.
Two (rarely three) eggs are said to be the clutch of the northern Great
Horned or Virginian Eagle-Owl ( B . v. virginianus) and it was this race
that was bred at Wargrave in 1928, the Society's medal being awarded for
this success.
Rats, mice and pieces of raw lean meat formed the diet, mice being the
main item. When the chick, which was hatched on about the 30th April,
was in its sub-adult plumage, it much resembled the parents; it appears
to be a female and since this breeding took place the father has died, his
age at the time of the arrival was not known. This appears to be the first
breeding in this country of the most southerly of the 16 races of Bubo
virginianus.

In the May-June issue of the Avicultural Magazine 1966, 72 , I have
already recorded the successful breeding of Red-faced Mousebirds ( Colius
indicus ) in my aviaries. I received them in 1961 and since 1962 they have
bred regularly. As part of a wider study I have also kept and bred Blue-
naped and Speckled Mousebirds ( Colius macrourus &amp; C. striatus) and to
date the three species have raised a total number of more than 100 young.
So I would like to give some additional notes to my earlier account.
The Blue-naped Mousebird ( Colius macrourus ) may be regarded as the
prettiest species of the group, as it is adorned with a patch of blue feathers
on the neck and the soft parts at the base of the bill and the naked skin
around the eyes are coloured red. Blue-naped Mousebirds also have the
longest feather crests of all colies and like to erect them to full height when
they are disturbed. Their range extends north of the Equatorial woods
in Africa from Senegal to Somaliland and south to Tanzania where they
are to be found in more open country and even in the towns as in Khartoum.
I obtained my Blue-naped Mousebirds from a bird dealer in the Nether-
lands and all ten specimens of the consignment were in good condition
when they arrived in Vienna in September 1961. Later on two of them
were transferred to the Zoo of Schonbrunn but the others were housed in
an indoor aviary similar to the one where my Red-faced Mousebirds had
already thrived for some time. I was very glad when I observed that the

DR. H. SCHIFTER--BREEDING BLUE-NAPED AND SPECKLED MOUSEBIRDS ^5
Blue-naped Colies soon formed four pairs and already in the following
spring made first breeding attempts. But they were not successful before
October 1962, when the first young of this species was reared. A second
ane died just before leaving the nest, but there were two more broods in
November and December 1962, and two Blue-naped Mousebirds were
latched and reared. In 19^3 3.11 pairs of this species bred with varying
mccess, the best raising 10 young from seven broods. In 1964 successful
breeding continued though the female of my best pair hurt its leg and died
n March 1964. The first breeding success from specimens already
latched in my aviaries also took place in 1964, when birds which were
hemselves reared only in January of the same year raised one young in
November. Because the number of my Blue-naped Mousebirds had
ncreased considerably I had to transfer a lot of specimens to various zoos
md aviculturists where some of them are still living.
Of the specimens I kept, one male died in February 1965 but now (in
September 1968), seven years after I received them, four specimens are still
hriving, though they are becoming old and already last year stopped all
seeding attempts. Nevertheless, both the old males still sometimes
)erform their curious display which consists of jumping up and down on a
&amp;gt;erch several times, often for a minute or longer, until the females approach
or copulation. These specimens have finally become quite tame and
&amp;gt;ne of the males, which is now living with my hand-reared Red-faced
dousebirds, likes to sit between them on their human friend's shoulder.
I also obtained the Speckled Mousebirds {Colius striatus ) in 1961. I
vas glad to see that my four specimens soon formed two pairs, which also
*red for the first time in 1962. Though the Speckled Mousebird is the
pecies of this family most frequently kept and was bred in Great Britain
s long ago as 1912 and 1914 (according to a note by Mr. Prestwich) and
ecently also in Denmark (see A. V. Nielsen in the German avicultural
)urnal Die gefiederte Welt, Vol. 84, i960), in England (Mrs. D. K. Draper
1 Foreign Birds, Vol. 24, 1958) and in the San Diego Zoo (Kenton C.
&apos;int in the Intern. Zoo Yearbook, Vol. 4, 1962) I was very glad that my
pecimens also bred because I then had the opportunity to compare the
reeding behaviour and the development of the young of both main
roups of the colies, the first represented by Coitus macrourus and C.
idtcus and the second represented by C. striatus. At first I housed my
peckled Mousebirds in an aviary together with various waxbills and quails
ut after a few months I built a new aviary measuring 3 m. in length, 2 m.
1 height and 1 -2 m. in depth where they settled very well and soon
lowed some interest in the nesting-sites I had fixed in the aviary.
In autumn 1962 both pairs bred successfully each producing four young
om two broods. After an interrupted brood one of the imported females
f this species died in March 1963, but the surviving male soon continued
reeding affairs with a young female, hatched in my aviary, and three
lung were reared in April 1963. There were four young in the nest

when I looked in it on the 7th of April, but the day afterwards the smallest
fledgling had been trampled by its older and stronger brethren. Another
breeding of this pair took place in June and two young were reared.
Successively two, three and two young respectively were hatched and
reared in July, September and November 1963. In 1964 this pair
continued to breed though I had to interrupt some broods to take embryos
from the eggs for further studies.
My second pair of the Speckled Coly bred again in 1963 also rearing
two young in January and one in February-March. After they had raised
another young in April, I observed some fighting between the two pairs
living together in an aviary and therefore I removed this pair to another
similar aviary. There the birds bred again having three more successful
broods in 1963, but each time rearing only one young. In the following
years breeding was again successful. Therefore I had to transfer some
specimens to various zoos and in the Zurich Zoo, Switzerland, they have
been very successful in breeding them. A note about this event appeared
in the Avicultural Magazine 1968, 74 , 2, (see page 65, recorded by
Christian R. Schmidt).
In 1965 I also had to transfer the remaining Speckled Mousebirds from
the Zoological Institute of the University of Vienna to my own quarters,
where I housed them in a glass-house, measuring 4 m. in length and 2 m.
in width, together w r ith the specimens of the other two species. There
the old birds bred again in 1966 and were thriving until the male of the
first pair died in August 1967, after exactly six years with me, and the female
of the second pair died after six and a half years in February 1968.
One specimen of the birds received in 1961 is still living and has even
bred with a younger female, but the eggs proved infertile this year. In
winter when they w ill be transferred to a heated shelter in my house I will
again separate the Speckled Mousebirds from the other species, but next
year I hope to put them together again. When housed together it is very
interesting to observe that the specimens of Red-faced and Speckled
Mousebirds never keep together, though there is some allopreenmg
between Blue-necked and Red-faced Colies. Because Red-faced and
Speckled Mousebirds sometimes even attack each other I prefer to sepa-
rate them in winter when there is not enough space available.
As I had done with the Red-faced Mousebird I also studied the breeding
behaviour and the development Qf the young in Blue-necked and Specklec
Colies. I was very glad to see that my results which had already beer
published in Vol. 94 1967 Zoologisches Jahrbuch , Abt. Syst. agree almosi
exactly with those of Mrs. M. K. Rowan, whose account on the Colies 0:
South Africa appeared in the Ostrich , Vol. 38 1967. I think, however
that the differences between the two main groups (the one being repre
sented by the Red-faced and Blue-naped Mousebirds, while the Speckle(
Mousebird and probably all the remaining species belong to the secoru
group) are sufficient to support even generic separation of Urocolius fron

Colius because the differences comprise not only morphological but also
)ehavioural aspects. I will deal elsewhere with these problems only
living here an abridged account of my results so far as they may be of
nterest for aviculture.
There are already some differences in nest-building, the Speckled Mouse-
birds using more grass and rootlets than Blue-naped and Red-faced
vlousebirds, which prefer twigs and which will breed in nesting-sites
ixed in the aviaries sometimes almost without any nesting material.
I he nest-building duties are shared between male and female, though the
nale is usually much more eager to bring nesting material to the nest
vhere the female will fix it. Later on lining (especially green leaves) will
&amp;gt;e brought to the nest, even during incubation until the young hatch.
The eggs of all three species are nearly similar in size but the eggs of
Colius macrourus more pointed and reddish-brown speckled like those
&amp;gt;f Colius indicus. The eggs of Coitus striatus are creamy-white, some-
imes being smeared or soiled after longer incubation, but always without
*lotches, and can therefore be easily distinguished. The clutch-size
bserved in my aviaries ranged from 2 to 6 in Colius striatus and from 1
in a young pair) to 4 in Coitus macrourus , the eggs usually being laid on
onsecutive days. I have no evidence that in these species two or more
emales have laid in the same nest as has been recorded from South Africa
y Rowan, but I have accidentally observed this in the Red-faced Mouse-
*ird when the aviary was somewhat overcrowded in 1964. In this year I
nee had six eggs in one basket and nearly always two adult birds were
rooding in the nest. The embryos which I had taken from these eggs
ere in quite different stages of development supporting the conclusion
iat two clutches were laid in the same nest. The only fledgling which I
-ft in the nest was then raised by three or four birds together. In other
roods also I have observed that more than the breeding bird took part in
taring the young. Moreover, in the Red-faced Mousebird I always had
lutches consisting of 2 or 3 eggs. On the contrary the six eggs of the
peckled Mousebird mentioned above were laid at regular intervals so that
am convinced that they were laid by one female only. Recently the old
lue-naped Mousebirds have had clutches consisting of single eggs only
hich, however, proved infertile.
As also recorded by Rowan mousebirds begin to brood immediately
ter the first egg of a clutch is laid. Both parents take part in incubation
ith several changes during the day, and the female sits on the nest during
ie night. I he eggs are never left unless the birds are greatly disturbed
id therefore it is not easy to control the nests regularly without irritating
ie birds. I here are no behavioural ceremonies when exchanging
icubation duties, but the males sometimes bring green leaves or other
isting material to the nest. As I have already stated in my account on
ie Red-faced Mousebird the incubation period is surprisingly brief and
1 an average is only 11 days in my Speckled and Blue-naped Mousebirds;

young sometimes even hatch after io |days. The mousebirds also usually
cease to brood after 12 or 13 days if no young are hatched though my tame
colies have sometimes even brooded up to three weeks. There was always
a high percentage of failure but as this is also recorded by Rowan in
natural surroundings in South Africa it need not be a consequence of the
conditions under which the mousebirds were kept in the aviaries. As I
have stated above for example many clutches consisting of two or three
eggs with only one young hatched.
As the mousebirds start to incubate as soon as the first egg of the
clutch is laid the young hatch at different times and the oldest nestling
may have grown to considerable size when the last one hatches. The
youngest may then be trampled by the older nestlings which has also been
recorded by Mrs. Rowan. This occurred in the above mentioned clutch
of six eggs of Colius striatus when four young hatched, but only three were
successfully reared. On the contrary, in another nest of the same species
a second young hatched five days after the first. Nevertheless both
young w r ere successfully reared though the older one left the nest some
days before the smaller nestling. I have never observed such enormous
intervals between the young of one clutch in the Blue-naped Mousebird.
This species is thus more like Colius indicus. ^
Newly-hatched mousebirds are " curious-looking creatures " as Van
Someren had already stated in the Ibis more than 50 years ago. The)
then weigh only P5~2 g. and have a total length of 33--35
young of the Speckled Mousebird are covered with sparse down, even or
the head and neck, w-hile those of the Blue-naped Coly are nearly naked
They thus very much resemble the nestlings of the Red-faced Mousebirc
which have only very little down and also entirely naked heads and necks
On the third and fourth day after hatching the primary quills and rectrice:
already start to appear and they grow quickly during the following days
Before the end of the first week most of the body feathers are ahead]
sprouting and even on the head the quills are appearing, beginning wit!
those in the middle of the head which later on will form the feather-crest
In the nestlings (of all species of mousebirds) a conspicuous patch of bar
skin is situated behind the crest and it is slightly differently shaped in th
various species. In the adult colies it is also present but is usually covere&amp;lt;
by the long crest-feathers and only visible w T hen the crest is stiongl
erected. The feather webs also begin to emerge from their sheaths oi
the sixth or seventh day after hatching and therefore the young are almos
totally covered w T hen they are just more than one week old. The eye.
which are closed in the first days, are narrowly opened on the fourth c
fifth day after hatching, but vision does not seem to be well establishe
before the beginning of the second week in the nestlings post-embryon&amp;lt;
life.
There are some morphological differences between Blue-naped an
Speckled Mousebird's nestlings which may be mentioned here. Fir:

the rump of the young Blue-naped Colies is grey as in the adult specimens,
and also in the young and old Red-faced Mousebirds. On the contrary,
in \oung Speckled Mousebirds a line of yellowish feathers appears on the
middle ol the rump on the sixth or seventh day after hatching, therefore
conspicuously contrasting with the brown feathers beside it. Laterally
these feathers are followed again by yellowish ones, thus forming a nice
pattern of stripes which has been also recorded by Rowan from South
African nestlings of Colitis stnatus. This pattern is best developed at the
beginning of the second week, later on the yellow feathers soon being
covered by the brown feathers beside them, and it totally disappears when
the nestlings are only two weeks old. This rump colour appears to be
usual in the young of all subspecies of Cohus striatus because Herbert
Friedmann has also recorded it for Kenyan Speckled Mousebirds in 1930.
surprisingly the adult White-backed Colies ( Colius colius ) have a quite
similar pattern on their backs.
T he development of the beak of the nestlings is also very interesting.
The young of the Speckled Mousebird have a yellowish-green upper
mandible and a blackish lower-one, unlike the adult specimens which have
.he upper mandible black (except for a bright spot on the culmen in
northern subspecies of Colius striatus ) and the lower one silvery grey.
The nestlings of the Blue-naped Mousebird have grey beaks only slightly
greenish tinged and with no difference in colour between lower and upper
mandible, thus resembling very much the beak of the young Red-faced
Mousebirds. Like them they have also bulbous swellings at the base of
he lower mandible which are somewhat similar to those in nestling wood-
peckers and honey-guides, d hese swellings are already present when the
voung hatch and they are fully developed at the end of the first week and
it the beginning of the second. Later on they are slowly reduced and have
ilmost disappeared after a month. The swellings are the same colour as
he beaks and are somewhat more prominent in the young Red-faced
^olies, but also well developed in the young Blue-naped Mousebirds
see plate 1). These swellings are, however, not the only difference
petween the nestlings of Colius macrourus or C. indicus and C. striatus
pecause the colour of the tongue and the gape is also different. Blue-
laped and Red-faced Mousebird nestlings have pink tongues and gapes,
v hile Speckled Mousebirds have black gapes and a yellow spot on the
ongue thus giving the mouth of this species quite a different appearance,
n all species I have observed the adult specimens have blackish gapes and
ongues. A conspicuous white egg-tooth is also present in the young of
&amp;gt;oth species dealt with here. In the nestlings of Blue-naped and Speckled
dousebirds the egg-tooth persists usually 8 to 10 days after hatching,
&apos; hile in the young of the Red-faced Mousebird I have seen it disappearing
( nly in the third week at the end of the nestling period.
The beak of the young Blue-naped Mousebird darkens, beginning at the
ip when the bird is about three weeks old, but remains whitish pink at the

base and only becomes red when the bird is at least two months old. A
similar colour change is to be seen in the young of the Red-faced Mouse-
bird (with the base sometimes also becoming black before brightening to
red) while the young of the Speckled Mousebird at the end of the first
month shows a slight darkening not only proceeding from the tip but also
from the base. In this state the young are easily identified by their
speckled beaks which do not show the colour distribution of the adults
before they are about three months old.
Though the young mousebirds grow rapidly they only reach half the
size of the adults when they leave the nest for the first time. In the
Speckled Mousebird this may occur on the ioth or nth day and only
slightly later in the Blue-naped Mousebird especially when the birds are
frightened and the adults utter alarm notes. Usually they stay somewhat
longer in the nest and leave it for the first time when they are about fourteen
days old. Then they hop and climb more than fly which they do not do
well before they are 16 or 17 days old. At this stage they also return to
the nest and stay there during the night always accompanied by one
parent bird, but they may sleep with the adult birds outside of the nest at
the end of the third week after hatching. Therefore it is difficult to give
an exact nestling period for mousebirds, but the span of 17! days given by-
Moreau, Skead and others (all cited by Rowan) agrees with my experiences
in captivity-bred specimens. I would say that Red-faced Mousebirds*:
generally have a slightly longer nestling period than Blue-naped ant
Speckled Mousebirds. As I have already stated the young are less thar
half the size of the adult birds when they leave the nest but are already
capable of flying. This is rather rare among birds, but seems to be a rule
in the colies. Full-size is only reached when the young birds are aboul
two months old, but even later they can be easily identified by the lack 0!
red on the beaks and the pale colour of the naked skin around the eyes (ir
Blue-naped and Red-faced Mousebirds) and by the speckled beaks anc
shorter feather crests in Coitus striatus.
The young colies are fed by the adults with regurgitated food (young 0
the Speckled Mousebird also take food from the beaks of the adult;
especially when they have already left the nest) and they do not feed b)
themselves until they are 5 to 6 weeks old. Only in the Speckled Mouse-
bird have I observed that the young were sometimes independent from tht
parents when they had only reached an age of about 4 weeks. Sometime:
the young were still fed when the adults had again started to incubate
Then the young even occasionally return to the nest to sit beside th&amp;lt;
brooding parent, but sometimes they may also visit nests of other pair;
and behave there in the same way unaffected by their hosts (which as fa
as I have seen have never fed the strange young). On the contrary olde
young from previous clutches may sometimes assist their parents n
rearing young of the next brood and may feed them even longer than thei
parents do.

Colies can also be kept together with their young when these are already
jrown up because close connection persists in these highly sociable birds.
So allo-preening continues between all members of a family group and they
vill also roost together in the tight clusters which are typical of these birds.
* have had the experience that the young neither disturb the breeding
iairs nor are they attacked by the adults. Sometimes I had twenty or
nore colies belonging to the same species in an aviary but there were no
erious disputes among them (when specimens of different species are kept
ogether some caution is necessary). On the contrary the young birds did
lot breed successfully as long as they were kept with their parents. So
llue-naped Mousebirds which I transferred in the aviary of the Speckled
holies bred there successfully for the first time in November 1964 and
ontinued breeding in 1965 at intervals of exactly two months (in the
*ther pairs the intervals were much more irregular and often much
horter). I had similar experiences concerning the remaining species.
\0x25A0 herefore I will conclude that mousebirds may breed exceptionally when
hey are only six months old but will usually only do this when they have
eached an age of about one year. Otherwise breeding activities may
ontinue over 5 or 6 years. A Red-faced Mousebird received in March
961, bred for the last time in September 1967 (one young being hatched
nd reared) and died in July 1968, while a male Speckled Coly also received
ill 1961 is still involved in breeding activities together with a five-year-
id female but now seems to produce only infertile eggs.
The following are some notes concerning the feeding of my colies,
he Blue-naped Mousebirds are fed in nearly the same way as the Red-
iced Colies which prefer bananas. Therefore they are always provided
/ith them in considerable quantities. In addition the Blue-naped Colies
Iso take pears, apples and especially lettuce. The Speckled Mousebirds,
owever, are not so fond of bananas and prefer other fruit such as oranges,
rapes, melons, soft apples and pears and they eat especially great quanti-
es of lettuce. Like the other mousebirds they are also regularly provided
ith white bread soaked in milk, a food they like very much. All my
Dlies are also given honey-water which is very useful for adding vitamin
lixtures such as Sanostol and Protovit. They prefer a softbill mixture
nly for feeding young but they refuse it when they are not involved in
reeding activities.
I had the best breeding results when the mousebirds were kept in large
ldoor aviaries with high temperatures usually ranging only from 20 to
D C. Now they only breed when they are housed in the glasshouse
Bring the summer months and in the winter are kept in smaller aviaries
mfortunately it is not possible to heat the above-mentioned glasshouse).
1 my birdroom I always have a temperature of 18 to 20*C. Colies
evertheless can stand lower temperatures without harm if it is dry.

cautious about housing them in outdoor aviaries in colder climates, when
the flights are not provided with sufficient shelters. In zoos the best
results have been achieved by keeping them in indoor aviaries where the}
thrive especially in the large planted flight aviaries which have beer
recently constructed in many zoos. Kept under good conditions colies wil
certainly prove satisfying and even charming aviary birds; an opinioi
which I can confirm without doubt after more than seven years experience

SOME EARLY SOUTH AFRICAN MEMBERS 01
THE AVICULTURAL SOCIETY

By F. Barnicoat (Johannesburg, South Africa)
In bird-fancying circles in South Africa the names of Frederick Meese
and Robert Cleugh are legendary. Both belonged to the Avicultura
Society in the thirties.
Meeser had made a fortune through promoting greyhound racing, bu
his real interest lay in bird keeping. His vast collection of parrot-like an-
softbilled birds, which included one of the leading studs of Budgerigars i
the country at that time, was beautifully housed in extensive aviaries in th
spacious grounds of his home. Merely the amount of fruit set out for th
birds used to stagger the lucky visitors to these aviaries.
From this establishment, too, came a delightful parrot story. Durin
the War a parrot from a captured German boat somehow got into th;
collection of birds. To all who approached it would loudly shout " He
Hitler! " The response this drew from people at that time might well b
imagined. Before long the loud " Heil Hitler! " was followed in a deepe
more gutteral tone by " B.Hitler "!
Frederick Meeser died about 1948 and his collection, valued at # 12,0c
or more was left in his will to the Johannesburg Zoo. A range of aviari(
was erected there in his memory, but the rare birds were not successful!
bred and very few survive now.
The other avicultural showpiece in Johannesburg was the aviaries &amp;lt;
Monty Kneen, a wealthy stockbroker, who often travelled to Sout
America and elsewhere more or less for the purpose of acquiring ra;
birds. In the very select suburb of Houghton he had his aviaries blaste
out of the solid rock of a north facing ridge.
Possibly even more absorbed in the hobby was Robert Cleugh. He ra
a prosperous fumigating business, but found time to maintain an amazir
collection of rare birds in a small suburban garden, practically every inch &amp;lt;
which was given over to aviaries. " President of the South African ar
Foreign Wild Bird Club " stands behind Robert Cleugh's name in tl
membership list of the Avicultural Society. He was a keen exhibit*

ad sharer of his avicultural experiences. In many ways he was the
ersonification of the South African and Foreign Wild Bird Club, which
id not survive him for very long. Meetings were usually held at his
ome where everything was geared to bird keeping activities. He had a
ne library of bird books in a prominent position in his dining room, and
t the bay window in a very large, fancy cage he kept a King Bird of
aradise, the only one ever to be privately owned in South Africa.
It is about a quarter of a century since I last visited Mr. Cleugh. He
as then quite an elderly man and I remember the various Jays and other
rge softbills he kept separately in large cages, but most of all he enthused
/er a pair of Red-headed Parrot Finches he had just received from Cape-
nvn. They were in an aviary all to themselves and he was hoping to breed
om them. I doubt if he did because his own life with its very long and
*ep association with aviculture was not destined to continue very much
nger.
I tried to locate the house again the other day. It is in a part of
)hannesburg no longer fashionable. No trace of the aviaries remained,
at in the small front garden was a fish pond with the remains of the
mcrete figure of an eagle perched on the side. There could be no
istake.
Present day fanciers, who often take our long tradition of shows, show
ge designs, schedules and the like for granted, owe much to the boundless
ithusiasm of this and other early South African aviculturists, some of
horn had brought what they knew about the hobby from Britain.
Having collected an almost complete set of Avicultural Magazines, I
as familiar with the very charming articles by C. N. Abrahams of Cape-
wn which were published in the late thirties and early forties, and so
hen I travelled the nine hundred odd miles to Capetown for the South
Mean National Bird Show in 1961 and saw that one of the foreign wild
rd judges was C. N. Abrahams, I decided to make a point of meeting
m. He had retired and had not kept birds for years, but, as he was
vered for his experience, his services as a judge were still sought. I
ould think so too, on perusing the list of birds in his aviaries recorded
the Avicultural Magazine of February 1938.
I found him a charming man, and he wanted me to meet his wife, whom
was bringing to the show on the Saturday afternoon if she could make
She was in very poor health but could just get about and managed to
me. So over a cup of tea they told me of their many delightful visits to
r. Cleugh in Johannesburg, and they brought out some old copies of
e Avicultural Magazine. These were precious possessions although
cy had long since ceased to be members of the Society. The little boy,
lose birthday present of three pairs of waxbills had been recorded as
ving triggered off the hobby, had not grown up to be interested in
eping birds; and bird watching, rather than bird keeping, had come to

be their hobby. Yet how thrilled they were to learn that David Seth
Smith was still alive and now, approaching ninety, was the honourec
president; and that Miss Knobel, whose gracious letters and encourage
W ere vivid in their recollections, was a vice-president and still si
actively associated with the Society. Mr. Abrahams had been harbou
master and recalled helping Walter Goodfellow get fruit for his collectioi
of birds as he passed through Capteown.
They had coloured slides of the famous Royal x Red-headed Parrot Find
hybrid (reported in the Avicultural Magazine of January-Februar
1945) and both its parents, taken many years afterwards of these bird
when stuffed and reposed in a glass cabinet in the South African M^useum
I was let into the secret that Mrs. Abrahams had really had most to d&amp;lt;
with the writing of the articles. I recalled the problems caused by th
Argentine ants, " the Japanese Army as they had referred to them becaus
of their small size, and the description of how carefully the aviaries had ha&amp;lt;
to be constructed to meet the difficult climatic conditions. ^.es
she said, " those aviaries were well built and are still standing. I ca
them his monuments, and sometimes when the South Easter is blowing
gale we hear a crash and I say, ' There goes another piece of your monu

A year or so later I was looking through the South African Nation;

CASSOWARY AND EMU AT CHESTER ZOO

In 1962 a Cassowary (Casuarius casuarius) arrived at the Zoo and in 19^
was positively identified as a hen, as she laid an egg. Unfortunatel)
mate could not be obtained for this bird.
The flightless birds at Chester Zoo are accommodated in spacious opt
paddocks at the rear of the Monkey House.
At the beginning of 1967 a young pair of Emus arrived and were plact
in the next paddock to the Cassowary. After a while the Emus start*
fighting, so were put in separate paddocks, a male being accommodate
in a pen adjoining that occupied by the female Cassowary.
The Emu and Cassowary certainly looked quite friendly through tl
wire mesh but it was a complete surprise to find the two birds together c
Tuesday, 5th November 1968. Upon investigation it was found that tl
Cassowary had simply kicked down the door separating the two enclosur
and had gone to visit her friend.
Keepers went inside the enclosure to separate the two species, as it w
thought that they could easily damage each other. As soon as they we
inside the Cassowary started to attack and being such a dangerous bi
they beat a very hasty retreat.

BIRD PELLETS--AN OPPORTUNITY FOR
AVICULTURAL STUDY

By David E. Hanson (Aberlour, Banffshire, Scotland)
Before the reader turns hastily to the next article, let it be said imme-
ately that there is nothing objectionable (or smelly) about a bird pellet!
he majority of readers will be quite familiar with the term " pellet ",
it it may be just as well to summarize the facts. A bird pellet is a
iherent, compacted mass consisting usually of the indigestible portions
1 the bird's food, and is ejected through the mouth.
A number of papers have been written on this subject, and many have
1 ncluded that pellet analysis does not provide a reliable indication of a
Ird's food. Despite this some fairly extensive food studies have been
inducted which make considerable use of pellet analysis, particularly in
le families of " hawks ", " owls ", " kingfishers ", " bee-eaters ",
&apos;waders " and " shrikes ".
For such analyses to be of the utmost value, it is necessary to know a
itle about the frequency of pellet ejection, pellet returns of food items,
This is most conveniently accomplished by studying birds in
iptivity, whilst of course the very nature of the bird's being in captivity
uy influence the factors which it is intended to investigate!
A number of studies have been completed, almost exclusively with the
)wls " and " hawks ". The results indicate that for the owls in
:neral, pellet analysis gives a fairly complete and accurate picture of the
rtebrate food, although quantitative assessment of invertebrate food is
licult if not impossible. Young birds are able to digest more of the
t nes in their food, it appears, than adults.
With the hawks, there is considerable disagreement amongst authors
yarding some species, although most concede that qualitative but not
antitative analysis is practicable. In general, hawks digest more of the
*eous material in their food than the owls, young birds more so than
ults.
Miss Hibbert-Ware's study of the pellets of the Common Heron Ardea
erea explains why it is that the pellets of this species do not give a
mplete picture of the vertebrate food, but H. C. White found that the
ilets of the Kingfisher Megaceryle alcyon provided a reliable indication

of the fish diet of that bird. He also found that young Kingfishers
digested more of the fish bones than did adults.
In these days of the increasing rarity of some of our most beautiful birds,
for example the Kingfisher Alcedo atthis , an investigation into food habits
could make greater use of pellet analysis, thereby lessening the need for
stomach analysis which in the absence of fresh natural corpses must
necessitate the further reduction of populations of these birds.
In addition to the possible " use " to which information regarding
pellets can be put, there is surely a case for collecting data " for its own
sake The writer has never been able to see a " use " for the wealth of
data on birds' eggs, or indeed for the numerous collections of eggs, but
he would not suggest that the studies were " useless ! Bird pellets
have been sadly neglected in the past, partly perhaps because of the
" unpleasant " nature which is often mistakenly ascribed to them, but
largely because of the difficulty of finding them in the wild. When one
considers the minute size and often friable nature of the pellets of the
smaller passerines, it is not difficult to see how easily they may be over-
looked. In addition to this the birds do not eject their pellets in con-
venient places or in the same place! In the wild, possibly the surest way
of obtaining information, short of witnessing the act of ejection, is to
investigate recently used nests. A recent search through the nest of the
Tree-creeper Certhia familiaris by G. P. Mawson has produced some good
examples of the pellets of this bird, and the writer has found pellets in the
nest of a Hedge-sparrow Prunella modularis. This sort of information is
interesting, but it does not indicate how frequently pellets are ejected,
nor the nature of the returns in relation to the food items.
It is here that the aviculturist has several decided advantages:
(i) he knows the nature of the food;
(ii) he can " find " a pellet with relative ease;
(iii) he knows approximately when each pellet is ejected, that is if the
bird is in a relatively small cage.
In the following list of families, in which there are species known tc
eject pellets, many are included on evidence of the habit in captive birds
In some instances there is doubt, or conflicting evidence, and such families

Despite an unchanged diet, the bird has to my knowledge ejected
d pellet since. Since writing this a few badly formed pellets were
iund, and it is possible that others broke up on ejection and were
distinguishable from the floor covering.
Cotitent of pellets. Of the vertebrate remains eaten by the bird, very
tie trace appeared in the pellets. Egg-shell was to a great extent digested.
The bulk of each pellet was taken up with sawdust--the material used
r covering the cage bottom (although the food was usually placed on
ates).
Grit was always available to the bird, but it was not often apparent in
e pellets.
The " pet food " containing a mixture of grain types usually appeared
one or more items per pellet.
Shape of pellets. Generally pointed at one end.
Size of pellets. Average of 14: 29-6 x 13-9 mm.
Length range: 15-40 (mode 35) mm.
Width range: 9-16 (mode 15) mm. (the mode being the most common
value).
An examination of the pellets of wild Rooks during the spring might
idicate that their diet is principally vegetarian. Very little trace of
;imal food appeared in the pellets of the captive Rook despite a diet
insisting of about 75% animal food.

Aviculture and the Introduction of Non-native Species
Within recent times some of the disastrous results of introducing specie
from one region of the earth to another have become so well-known tha
no one can now argue that such introductions could be done with impunit
and without careful study. The International Union for the Conservatioi
of Nature's Commission on Ecology has issued a statement within the las
few months drawing to the attention of various governments the legislation
and administrative measures needed to control this introduction of non
native species; but apart from the government of the United States whic !
has become a little apprehensive about bird importations, and the Austra
lian Government which has taken rather drastic action, few seem to hav
seriously considered the part that aviculturists may play in deliberate 0
inadvertent introductions.
There are several trends and occurrences in present-day avicultur
which may give cause for concern. One is the increase in the keeping c
birds at partial liberty. This is sometimes done in an attempt to breed
bird that has otherwise proved too difficult, or may merely be used i
order to give birds with cramped quarters greater liberty. Another is th
tendency for some aviculturists to release small flocks of some species
which are available cheaply from dealers, in the hope that they will sta
nearby. In both instances the people concerned can probably feel tha
they are presenting little danger to our native birds by so doing. Froi
past evidence it would seem that few foreign birds survive our winter:
although they may move around considerably, and Budgerigars hav
occurred with migrating birds on lightships! If, however, one specie

her encouragement, and the fact that nothing has " got away " so
in this part of the world does not mean that it never will,
he main danger here is that if such experiments become popular and
ely advocated in avicultural writing then aviculturists in other, more
mrable, climates may well be encouraged to emulate them, with
strous results.
.nother worrying thing that has occurred is requests to various bird-
)ing organisations from aviculturists abroad, in less well-developed
ntries, for numbers of individuals of our commoner native species
ch they intend to release in their own countries. This should never be
nitted. Some such requests have come from South America where the
:ad of agriculture and urban development is fast destroying native
Nation and where the native birds are being rapidly reduced. Where
I drastic changes are taking place there is inevitably a time-lag before
e, at least, of the native species adapt themselves to their new environ-
it. If, during this crucial period, foreign birds already adapted to the
lged environment are introduced they will fill the vacant niche and the
ve species will be robbed of an opportunity to adapt themselves; while
petition with the new invaders may in some cases be the final factor in
ging about their extermination.
his is not idle theory. It was changes of this kind which enabled the
ise-Sparrow and Starling to establish themselves widely in North
irica. In Australia the Spice Finch from Asia, brought in as a cage-
, has established itself in the north-east and is spreading and driving
the native grassfinches; while in some urban areas the Spotted Dove
Palm Dove occupy the places which should be filled by the smaller
it species of dove.
is up to the aviculturists themselves to show a responsible attitude in
matter. If we do not ensure that our birdkeeping is so organised that

1. All aviculturists should take extreme care when allowing birds

4 - No aviculturist should even contemplate supplying birds to persons

roduction without proper official sanction.

By J. J. Yealland
A pair of Pheasant-tailed Jacanas (Hydrophasianus chirugus) present*
by Dr. K. C. Searle are the first of this species to be in the collection sin
many years ago, the previous one or ones not being traceable among t]
record cards, but at some time between 1883 and 1927 the species was fii
exhibited here. Also sent by Dr. Searle during December were a pair
Silky Starlings and two Grey Starlings.
For several years there have been no Laughing Kingfishers (Kook
burras) in the Gardens, but this has now been remedied by the arrival
four young specimens from Taronga Park, Sydney.
A Crested Pigeon was hatched on the 17th January, an egg is beii
incubated by the breeding female Javan Fish-owl and Cereopsis Geese a
nesting--more than a month later than usual.
A Rook received in July 1946 has, because of its apparent senility, be
found a private home.

It is gratifying to read in Birds, the Magazine of the R.S.P.B., that the
iccessful breedings of the Osprey and Snowy Owl in 1967, were repeated
st year.
Three pairs of Ospreys nested. The pair at Loch Garten reared two,
lother pair three, but the third pair failed to hatch their eggs.
The pair of Snowy Owls on Fetlar nested, laid six eggs, all of which
itched, but only the three eldest chicks survived.
The Avocets on Havergate Island had a very successful breeding season,
ith 108 nesting pairs rearing 162 young; but at Minsmere seven pairs
ared only seven young--probably due to the depredation of rats.

After reading " Quetzal Quest " by Victor W. v. Hagen and Quail
awkins I w as determined, if ever the opportunity occurred, to possess a
ir of Resplendent Trogans. But the chance never came my way. The
n Hagens were the first to bring these gorgeous and almost mythical
I rds alive to Europe. The birds they brought over were exhibited in the
rd House, London Zoological Gardens, and I had to be content with
miring them there. My interest in these Trogans has been maintained
&amp;quot;wn the years and so I was the more pleased to find " The Quetzal:
IduIous bird of Maya Land in the National Geographic, January, 1969.

ring we had great hopes of a very successful breeding season as nearly all
our pairs laid eggs. But a few weeks later we were sadly disillusioned--
some nests only one or two eggs hatched, and many clutches were
ertile. Other breeders in our area had a similar experience. We
lieve that the explanation is that at the end of April, when most of the
ns laid, the temperature was as high as in summer (27-3o*C.). This
ised the cocks to lose vigour and so become uninterested in their hens.
1 account of this even established pairs that rear young every year failed,
irs that commenced breeding at the end of May did better and so, on the
ole we did fairly well. Rosella, eight in two nests; Mealy Rosella, ten
m three pairs; Stanley, three; Adelaide, five from three pairs--many
ertile eggs; Crimson-winged, three from two pairs; Rainbow Lorikeet,
13; White-eared Conure, three; Splendid, about twenty-five from three
rs. One of our four pairs of Pileated reared four young; the others had
i ertile eggs. Barnard's, three young from one pair, the second made no
-mpt; King, two lovely young ones. Recent arrivals are a pair of
een Rosellas and two pairs of Gouldians ".

'STIMULITE' NECTAR FOOD is a COMPLETE NUTRI-
TIONAL food in highly concentrated form. It is highly
beneficial to all livestock, whether it be Humming Birds,
Sun Birds or other Nectarines, Insectivorous Birds, Fruit-
eaters, Canaries, Finches, Parrakeets, Parrots, or any kind
of animal. This supreme food should be available to
them at all times.
Recently there has been some advocacy of a sugar and protein diet for
Humming Birds, such a diet is very deficient in nutritional value.
PROTEIN is produced within the body by METABOLISM from the
nutrients in the food consumed. A diet, to be fully nutritional, has to
contain all the essential vitamins, A, D, E, C, and the full vitamin B
Complex, Bl, B2, B6, B12 (known as the animal-protein factor), the full
context contains Thiamin, Riboflavine, Nicotinic Acid, Pantothenic Acid.
Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Inositol, Choline and Biotin. Only a food
containing all of these can be termed COMPLETE.
Metabolism can only convert the food into protein if the food also
contains the following amino acids : Arginine, Histidine, Lysine,
Trypotophane, Phenylalanine, Methionine, Leucine, Isoleucine and
Valine. All these factors are necessary for a fully nutritional food, they
are not hearsay, but SCIENTIFIC FACTS which can be verified.

There are two races of Nectarinia adelberti:
adelberti (Gervais), Sierra Leone to Ghana (Gold Coast).
eboensis Jardine, Togoland to south-eastern Nigeria,
vliss Chloe Talbot-Kelly has depicted a male and a female, life size, on a

The type of this species was obtained by Adelbert, supposedly in Sene-
and was described as Cinnyris adelberti by Gervais, in 1834. Shelley

Electors seem to be interested in little other than recording, in the past
&amp;lt; netimes not too reliably, the area in which their specimens were obtained,
s indeed very strange how often they make the excuse that any particular
&amp;gt;d was too far away, in too tall a tree or in too dense scrub, etc, or else it
v&amp;gt; too dark to allow observation. And yet they manage to collect it,
ner dead or alive!
L S. Webb introduced this and numerous other sunbirds, to aviculture,
brought some from the Gold Coast in 1937. The London Zoo Report
hat year lists it as new to the collection; and C. T. Maxwell exhibited
11; at the " Crystal Palace National Show " (Dorland Hall, Lower
^ent Street), in January the following year. There have, of course,
&amp;quot; n others since.
&amp;quot;he only really informative account is appropriately by Webb. It is
uth quoting extensively:
In company with Superb Sunbirds (Cinnyris superbus), Olive-bellied

\0x25A0 or three species of Anthreptes, as well as numbers of Bulbuls (Pycno-

sistible attraction to all nectar-feeding birds. During the months of

remained to feed on the flowers of bananas and paw-paws, etc. It is quil
likely that the former migrated to another district where the bombax wei

" Like most species of the genus Chalcomitra , it does not become
confidingly tame as some of the Anthveptes or Cinnyvis , but its striking an
unusual coloration and graceful movements combine to make it one (
the most desirable of the nectarinidae.
" Owing to their feeding habits, Buff-throated Sunbirds are exceeding
difficult to capture alive. Bombax trees grow to a great height and tl
lower half of the trunk is branchless, and so climbing them in the humi
enervating heat of the Gold Coast forest is an arduous proceeding. Til
crevices in the bark harbour colonies of vicious black ants which emeq
in thousands as one labours up the tree, and if one can survive this 01
slaught and reach the branches it is to discover that the fun has only ju:
commenced, for here large red ants that make their nests among the leav
advance from all directions i with intent to do bodily harm .
" Both these varieties will fight an intruder like maddened warriors ar
swarm over him in incredible numbers inflicting painful bites. Added
this, swarms of small flies, resembling minute bees in shape, are attract*
to one's eyes for the moisture, and hover in front of them with an annoyir
zigzag flight.
" The upper trunk and branches of bombax trees are studded wii
protuberances with sharp thorny tips so that it is almost impossible
climb them without getting one's arms badly torn .
The Nigerian eboensis differs from the Senegal by the darker chestn
(less rufous) of the breast and belly of the male and by a slightly pal
throat. The female appears to be lighter coloured on the underparts, tl
breast being pale yellowish-grey marked with pale brown.
Sir William Jardine (1843) says this sunbird was first obtained by Mj
Thomson, one of the surgeons to the Niger expedition. He names
Nectarinia eboensis , Thomson, Eboe Sun-bird.
According to Bannerman: " S. Marchant writes concerning the birds

THE SPECTACLED JAY-THRUSH
(Garrulax canorus)

The Spectacled Jay-Thrush is a favourite cagebird among Chinese
Eciers. It is so for two reasons. Firstly, for its exquisite song which
spares favourably with the best bird songs of other lands. In Singa-
ce and the Malaysian territories, as a songbird it ranks at par with the
oma and the Red-whiskered Bulbul (a native songbird which seems to
d a special attraction for the Malay bird fanciers). Secondly, for its
gnacity. Like the Magpie-Robin noted for its fighting qualities, the
1 cky Jay-Thrush is often trained as a fighting bird by gamblers and
ced against other birds in illegal contests where money changes hands
wagers.
depicted in art and extolled in literature, this Chinese songbird is
&amp;gt;orted in large numbers from maritime Fukien Province in South
.ina to Southeast Asia, Hongkong being the chief collecting and distri-
1 ing centre. It is strange that despite the presence of large numbers of
;ed specimens in Southeast Asia no local colonies have yet been estab-
ed by escaped birds in these regions.
V native of the vast sprawling hill forests of Szechuan Province, South-
ct China, it is now widespread in South China ranging into the northern
1 vinces in the summer season. There are no sub-species, although the

existence of an albino bird is mentioned in an old Chinese encyclopaedi
published some decades ago in Shanghai. For some quaint reasons
fanciers in Singapore group the bird into the " Canton " and the Shang
hai " types, the latter being purported to be of bigger size and mor
immaculate feathering.
The plumage colour is brown with a tinge of grey on the belly. Slightl
darker or lighter shades of brown occur in individuals. " Golden
brown is the most attractive. The distinctive feature is a bluish-white ey
rim extending backwards like an eyebrow, hence the Chinese rendering c
the name--" Huamei " which means painted eyebrows. About eigl
inches in total length, the bird has a fairly thick body and noticeabl
short rounded wings. In the wild state, it probably favours deep wooc
and forests, spending its time in the underbrush searching for insect
wild seeds and berries, constantly flicking and swishing its tail as it mov&amp;lt;
along in small foraging parties in the non-breeding season. I had tl
occasion to observe a bird of mine which escaped into the garden. Durir
the brief period before recapture, it skulked among the bushy hedges an
fence creepers or hopped rapidly up the branches of the Casuarina tree
It was very hard to spot even while perching on the swaying tip end of
branch. Constantly on the move, its calls added to its elusiveness,
caged specimen is restless and noisy. At times it performs seeming
endless hops up and down the cage.
The sexes are alike and difficult to differentiate. The female is general
smaller and lacks the song of the male. The female call is a series
monotones which are always answered by a male within hearing in a she
burst of song. There are no records of breeding as only cock birds a
kept as pets.
Of hardy constitution, the Spectacled Jay-Thrush is however prone
overgrown beak and claws. Large sized perches help towards keepu
the claws trim, the thick, rough-surfaced types with their natural contc
tions being favoured. Because of the excitable nature of the bird, fancit
are reluctant to handle their birds for clipping for fear of frightening t
birds. Cases are not uncommon where birds are reduced to nervousm
and frightened into total loss of song. The problem is solved by gluing
strip of fine quality sandpaper along the underside of the perch. If a bird
to be handled for some reason or other, it should be caught with little fi
to avoid fright and excessive dropping of feathers. As regards the ovt
grown upper mandible, it is taken care of by providing the bird witl
cuttlefish bone to peck with. There is also a tendency to develop hs
horny scales on the legs and toes. This unsightly condition is accentuat
by not bathing the bird regularly.
The staple food is " egg rice a traditional Chinese birdfood form
prepared by frying unpolished rice with beaten egg yolk to a degree
crispness so that it keeps fresh for long period without deteriorate
Raw food in the form of live skinks are fed to the bird. The insectivon

;3ect of the diet consists of king-size grasshoppers which abound in
agapore in the " lallang " areas and secondary forests and are offered for
i.e by professional collectors who go as far afield as southern Johore, a
ighbouring state to the north of Singapore. Grasshoppers are a song
mulant and are fed to the birds without restraint. Unlike mealworms,
:2y do not cause any ill effect. A generous supply of grasshoppers given
ily to the Spectacled Jay-Thrush will keep the bird in full song through-
:t the year except when in moult.
The Spectacled Jay-Thrush is a great bather and in Singapore where the
rather is hot, bathing should be a daily routine to be observed without
1 or the bird will soon loose its feather condition. Fanciers in the
fiurbs leave their caged birds overnight in the open to catch the morning
w which is good for the feathers. When bathing the bird, a cage with
] hallow bath-pan is required. Full spraying should be avoided whenever
:ssible as this excites the bird and fails to wet the feathers sufficiently,
le best time for bathing is in the afternoon hours in the heat of the day
aen the bird will take to its bath without undue delay and soak itself
oroughly provided the bathing-cage is placed in the sun and at a regular
ae.
The song of the Spectacled Jay-Thrush is loud, full-throated and
:isists of a variety of melodious phrases of about three to half a dozen
tes of varying scales repeated two or three times in rapid succession,
le style of delivery is not quite unlike that of the Mockingbird. A
rson who has not heard the song before is bound to be delighted by the
:iuty of the clear ringing notes.
The full song is heard in the morning and this gradually softens in pitch
id intensity towards noon when it is maintained in an undertone at inter-
s with sporadic bursts of song.
To enjoy the full beauty of the song, a fancier needs to take his bird for a
oil in the countryside in the early hours of dawn when it will render its
:5t and employ all that it has in its repertoire. The tones heard in the
*rning quietude among trees and blossoms take on a new depth never
xeived when the song is rendered in the confines of the living room.
\s in most cases of beginner fanciers, when the initial enthusiasm of
dkeeping wears off and the birds are neglected, abatement culminating
complete cessation of song sets in. I had a good songster, a one-time
:itest singer so to speak, in this condition. It sat on the perch with
ffTed bodyfeathers, oblivious to the world, only rousing itself to feed and
Ink. It perked up on the introduction of a new bird. It is at least
en years old now as I have kept it since February 1964. The feathers
ve somewhat lost their gloss and the tail feathers refuse to grow. I call

iety of notes. Although it has now reverted back to its old singing
pit, its notes have somehow lost their original timbre and power. Age

Like the Shamas and the Magpie-Robins, individual birds vary
singing capability and style. A good songster is able to give a superlati 1
rendering of all the typical Huamei refrains which are a delight to the es
The cock bird is an accomplished mimic and if kept with other songbiri
will incorporate their call notes in its song. My birds are able to imita
with remarkable likeness the calls of my neighbour's Red-Whisker&amp;lt;
Bulbuls and the staccato notes of my pet leafbird. If one whistles tl
opening bars of a song or play flute music on the amplifier, a cock w:
invariably respond and burst into a wild medley. Sudden darkening
the sky followed by rain has similar effect of inducing the bird to sing.
The cock Spectacled Jay-Thrush is extremely pugnacious and the sig
of another male specimen will induce it to display a series of challeni
postures--quivers its wings, fluffs its body feathers and utters low cat-li
mews, or stands erect on the perch performing slow Hula-like movemer
and utters chuckling notes as it dips its tail and nods its head in rhythm
unison, or ostentatiously jumps up and down the perch with much nois
Ever spoiling for fight, it makes successive attempts to dash across the cag
When excited, it moves restlessly or " freezes " into a posture as if me
merized. A cock bird will also start a duet with another in sight, pourii
out his song in an attempt to drown the voice of the other. If the bir
are not removed in time, the song intensity may eventually frighten o
bird into silence. It is therefore imperative that if two cock birds a
kept, they must be kept out of sight but within earshot of one anothc
This has the twofold effect of (i) stimulating the birds to sing by conta
and response calls and (2) preventing the nerve fright.
New birds of both sexes are imported into Singapore and at the first ne'
of their arrival the birdshops are clustered with fanciers each eager
bring home a good bird. The new birds are cheap and cost only
Singapore dollars each. They are put in special cages designed to conti
nervousness. These are hung in rows under bamboo poles for t
inspection of prospective buyers who will whistle the female call to pi
out the males. There is no doubt that a bird which responds in a she
burst of song is a male. In the selection of a potential singer, so
performance, tone quality and posture are the qualities to look for. T
eyebrow or " spectacle " must be thick and well-defined. It is believ
that the eyebrow serves as an indicator to the bird's singing capability,

brought home are put into an intensive course of nutritious food ai
grasshopper diet to pull them out of the shock of transhipment. Aftei
couple of months when the birds are more steady and are in full song, th
are offered for sale.
The taming process is a job usually undertaken by the professional a
the more enterprising fanciers. The bird is confined in a small rectangu
cage of deliberately low height, usually not more than eight in. high, wi
three closed sides and one barred front. The idea here is to give the bi

try little room to make wild dashes. When the bird is less flighty (it
kes about a month or so), it is transferred to a permanent cage described
1 the concluding paragraph. A piece of dark coloured cloth is stitched to
t to the cage top. If the bird is still nervous, the perch should be fixed
tar the top of the cage. The cage is hung high above head level,
his is important because the bird should not be allowed to get unduly
ervous or otherwise the undesirable " twirling of the neck " will occur,
his is a condition very similar to that which afflicts the Green Singing
inch and the Pekin Robin, but is unfortunately more pronounced,
aking the birds out for regular walks in the parks on weekends or taking
iem to coffee-shops where bird fanciers congregate are also part of the
\0x25A0ocess of taming. Taming is completed when the cloth cover may be
moved permanently with the bird showing no undue signs of nervous-
[sss.
I have no practical experience with regard to keeping this bird in a
trden aviary. My experience is limited to an hour's observation of a
lir kept in a school aviary in a mixed collection of birds consisting of
me Spotted Doves, Red-Whiskered Bulbuls, Hanging Parrots, Java
Darrows, Emerald Doves and pheasants. The aviary was spacious, some
) ft. long, 12 ft. wide and 8 ft. high, shielded from wind at one end.
he inmate cock Spectacled Jay-Thrush was an exceptionally big speci-
en and the hen was slightly bedraggled and her wing primaries showed
int traces of white. They were active birds and hopped from branch to
anch, frequently darting to the ground to forage for insects. While on
e ground, they moved in a series of fast well executed Kangaroo-like
)ps. Three or four times the cock covered the full length of the aviary
Dm end to end in less than half a dozen hops. This was indeed an exhi-
tion of fluid movement. The birds were not overtly aggressive though
ey had a tendency to drive the smaller birds from the water trays. Even
e larger sized doves fought shy of them. They did not appear to be
raid of the pheasants with which they fed side by side at the food trough,
hile on the ground, they would lift up their heads to look around. A
ssing cat set up an alarm call from the cock, which sent the hen flying up
a branch. Anting was indulged by both birds. At intervals the cock
ould hop up to a top branch and burst into a short song. The birds dis-
ayed a mixture of cockiness and curiosity reminiscent of Mynah birds,
^ery now and then, one bird would peep into a nest of mice outside the
iary on the top wire-netting, chiding incessantly, to be joined by the
&apos;her.
To the Chinese fanciers, part of the fun of bird-keeping is in owning a
rdcage. It is with this in mind that every Chinese birdcage is construc-
I with meticulous care. It is a masterpiece of art in itself and comes
incipally from China where cage-making has been refined to an exclusive
; l. Mainly made of a type of stout and flexible bamboo, the cage is light

headed Parrot (P. cryptoxanthus), the Orange-bellied Parrot (P. rujiventri
and the Senegal Parrot (P. senegalus). As a boy I received a pet Seneg
which I kept from 4th April 1924 to 26th October i960--more than 3
years.
On nth June 1955, at the instigation of the director, Dr. D. Hey, v
received from the Department of Nature Conservation, Stellenbos
South Africa, a pair of Cape Parrots; which were determined from Aust
Roberts' " The Birds of South Africa " (1948), as Poicephalus robust
robustus. The range of this parrot extends from Knysna to the Eastei
Transvaal, P. r. angolensis is found from the River Limpopo to Ango
while P. r. suahelicus inhabits the eastern part of Southern Rhodesia ar
the former Portuguese East Africa. The three subspecies differ in tl
size of the beak and in minor colour features. The South African Natu
Conservation Authorities estimate the Cape Parrot population to be in
precarious position and, in recognition of the breeding achievements
Basle Zoo, entrusted us with a pair, expressing the hope that the parrc
could be induced to breed.
On their arrival, the Cape Parrots were introduced into an aviary, 195
225 x 150 cm., shared by Brown Parrots, Senegals and, now and then, ev&amp;lt;

DR. E. M. LANG--SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE CAPE PARROT 85
iOm the aviary, the Cape Parrots finally began to reproduce. Practice
as shown us that, often enough, breeding activities do not occur until one
air of birds has gained the sole ownership of an aviary.
In the Cape Parrot the sexes are easily distinguishable. The female is
haracterized by a bright red forehead while the head of the male shows
ractically no red. The male possesses the more powerful beak of the two.
On 16th April 1964 the first chick hatched in a hollow tree trunk. A
est-box check on 12th May revealed a half-grown nestling and an addled
yg. On 29th June the young bird left the breeding place, to be observed,
few days later, climbing about in the aviary. The nestling period had
*sted approximately 74 days. The youngster made good progress and
as separated from its parents on 9th September. On 29th August 1966
was given, together with another juvenile from a later clutch, to the
an Diego Zoo, U.S.A.
On 26th October of the same year another chick hatched which lived for
lly 10 days.
Several times during the following year, 1965, eggs were laid, a number
-ing deposited on the aviary floor beside the nesting hollow. The keeper
ansferred them to the nest where they were incubated, somewhat
iphazardly, by the adults but nevertheless failed to hatch. Four eggs
ere removed in June as the birds had lost interest in brooding. In July
ie nest was visited again. Apparently further layings took place for, on
)th August, three chicks were present. The first fledged on 4th and the
st on 16th October. The nestling period, in this case, lasted for 55-67
lys. Each youngster had badly damaged head feathers, in fact, a large
irt of the crown was quite naked. Evidently the hen, in an over-
gerness to preen the chicks, bites their head quills right off. As soon as
e young birds can feed independently and are removed from the aviary,
e feathers generally grow normally. The hen practises the same
sconcerting habit on the cock with the result that his crown, too, is
nost bald.
In 1966 two clutches were laid, the first of which failed to hatch. Tw f o
died eggs w^ere removed in March. In May, however, the nest contained
0 further chicks. They fledged and, on 14th June, were separated from
e adults to allow their head feathers to recover as quickly as possible.
The following year there were two successful clutches. On 1st March
67 and 3rd September 1967 respectively, three chicks hatched which
re reared by the parents. The nestling period in the September clutch
ted from 7 2 ~79 days. One of the birds moved clumsily, being unable
use his left wing. I took him home and we fed him on a pre-chewed
ish consisting mainly of rusk and banana. He adapted to his new
roundings within a few days, allowed himself to be handled and supped
&amp;gt; food out of a spoon. The wing obviously gave him some pain but the
ury could not be exactly located. I suspected a torn muscle in the
ist. The wing has never been folded close to the body nor has the

power of flight improved, so he has stayed with us ever since as a pet, is
perfectly tame, climbs eagerly onto a proferred hand and makes friends
with everyone.
The young parrot (hatched 3rd September 1967) afforded an excelleni
opportunity to observe the change of plumage. At first he had a brick-rec
forehead like the other members of the clutch but showed no red colouring
elsewhere. The head and neck were a brownish olive-green, wings and
tail dark green, rump and breast a lighter green. In February 1968, the
tiny red forehead feathers began to fall out so that, by the middle of April
the red border had completely disappeared. On 14th April I observed
the appearance of red feathers above the ankle joint, the beginnings 0:
the red breeches worn by the adults of both sexes. On 19th June tht
first tiny red feathers under the front edge of the wing sprouted. Oui
Cape Parrot must be a male because in the females, as was observed in tht
tame bird's sisters, a bright red band on the forehead appears simul
taneously with the red breeches.
On 3rd April 1968 Keeper Marcus Ruf discovered a full clutch of thre&amp;lt;
eggs which had probably just been completed.
On 30th April two very small nestlings were present. The third egj
contained a dead foetus. After 65-68 days the youngsters--again witl
bald-bitten heads--left the nesting hollow. On 20th August they seemet
sufficiently independent to be separated from the adults.
Thus from seven clutches, 15 Cape Parrots have been reared in th.
Basle Zoo since 1964. The nestling period was established at betweei
54 and 79 days. The juveniles show a brick-red colouring on the forehea(
which disappears, at the age of about five months, to be replaced, in th&amp;lt;
females, by a bright red band.

Introduction
I bought a male and female Lagonostica rhodopareia jamesoni on the 8th
iptember 1963. The male was in beautiful condition but the female
oked very ill and I doubted my ability to save her, only too justifiably, as
e died the following day. Soon after this I obtained a female of the
irk western race (L. r. virata). In this form, which must be well on the
ay to becoming a good species, the sexes are nearly alike and the female,
though darker, shows as much red as a male of the eastern forms. I
ve described both forms elsewhere (Goodwin 1964) and explained how
ese two firefinches apparently " mistook " each other's sex. They did
&apos;t respond sexually to one another and the female paired to a male Dark
refinch [L. rubricata ) and later died egg-bound.
All my attempts to obtain a female jamesoni failed (and have, indeed,
ntinued to fail from that day to this, December 1968) but in May 1964 I
maged to get hold of another female virata. At this time I had no
irk Firefinches and, with no other congenors present, the jamesoni and
ata eventually paired, after an initial period of " misunderstanding "
lowed by several weeks in which they showed little sign of either
stile or sexual reactions. They frequently nested but on only one
~asion am I certain that a young one was hatched and then it vanished
thout trace on the second day.

On 20th February 1966 I put a Rosy-rumped Waxbill ( Estrilda
&amp;gt;dopyga) with a damaged wing into the bird room. The male Firefinch
once flew down to it and mounted it repeatedly for the next five or six
nutes. He showed no overt aggression and I am far from convinced that
*re is, as some think (Kunkel 1967), any aggressive motivation in this
laviour which is shown, at least in captivity, by all male firefinches
igonisticta ) to strange females of their own species. It seems to me to be
&apos;urely sexual response, (the human moralist might term it impurely
ual!) which, as the male has no feelings of affection or tenderness
* ards the stranger (these being reserved for his mate), can be expressed
ardless of her reactions. Ducks, as is well known, show comparable
laviour.
)n the 25th of February I put a new female Blue-headed Waxbill
aeginthus cyanocephalus) into the room. She alighted on the floor (all
se new birds were put through the " Judas hole " (see description in

otherwise disturbed and I could watch what happened) and a male Blue-
head at once flew down and mounted her. As in the classic case of Thetis
and Peleus this was " much against her will " but before she had time to
do anything about it the Jameson's Firefinch dashed down, fiercely attacked
the mounted cock Blue-head and, after he had dislodged him, spent the
next five minutes or so enthusiastically but not successfully attempting tc
follow his example. He behaved similarly to a female Cordon Lieu (L.
bengalus) that I put in about ten minutes later but not to any of the three
female Red-eared Waxbills {Estrilda troglodytes) that were let into the
room about half an hour afterwards. I must add at this point that there
had previously been other Blue-heads and Cordon Bleus of both sexes in
the room but, for the period the Firefinches had been in it, the onl&amp;gt;
Estrilda species had been a cock Rosy-rump (which had died some months
previously) and his hybrid Rosy-rump x Red-eared daughter who more
resembled a Rosy-rump (or, for that matter a firefinch) in the colour of her
upper parts as she had a largely red rump and a rosy flush on the ings.
The cock Jameson's Firefinch had not, to my knowledge, shown any sexual
interest in any of these birds that had shared the room with him but his
reaction to strange individuals showed that he was not now indifferent tc
their species.
After this episode with the new birds the Firefinch did not show an)
sexual interest (so far as I observed) in any birds other than his mate (the
hen virata) until after her death on 27th of May 1966. At this time ht
was moulting and although by no means ill did not appear to be quit(
his usual self ". On 26th of June I noticed with some surprise that he
was showing a definite interest in one of the male Blue-heads It ellov
Left. When this cock Blue-head gave his stem display, the male Firefincl
at once flew and perched near him, approached him with tail twistec
towards him in the usual estrildine manner, when sexually interested ir
another individual, and gave his greeting display (see Goodwin 1964)
When I first noticed this the association had evidently been going on some
little time as further watching on that day showed that the two often sa
together side by side, the Firefinch always going to the Blue-head no
vice versa, and once I saw the Blue-head briefly preen him. The Firefincl
was at this time still in full moult and had not sung or displayed since ^
few days after his mate had died. At this time the Blue-head was courting
a female. The Firefinch's prompt responses to his stem display anc
tendency to get between him and his beloved in a literal sense must hav&amp;lt;
been frustrating but he showed no aggression towards him, nor did th&amp;lt;
Firefinch and the hen Blue-head show any jealousy of each other. This
lack of sexual jealousy is a usual feature of interspecific attachments ii
waxbills and contrasts strongly with the vindictive jealousy of sexua
rivals shown in normal pairings.
On the tenth of July I noticed the Firefinch busily foraging about unde
some twigs on the floor. The Blue-head Yellow Left, high up on a perch

egan to display with a stem, breaking into song as the display got going,
s soon as he began to sing the Firefinch at once stopped his fossicking
)Out, looked up and flew to the Blue-head, giving intense greeting
isplay as he came up to him. Later I saw this on many occasions; the
irefinch took no notice whatsoever when other Blue-headed Waxbills
isplayed but as soon as he heard Yellow Left start to sing (if he had not
ready seen him begin to display) he flew at once to him. There can be
3 doubt that he recognized his mate's song just as a female Blue-head
pes.
Although remaining more or less faithful to the indifferent cock Blue-
;ad, as shown by frequently resting snuggled beside him and almost
ways responding, as above described, to his stem display, the Firefinch
d not restrict his sexual interest to him.
By the middle of March 1967 he had come into full breeding condition
id frequently gave the stem display himself. Often he did so very
lortly after the Blue-head cock had displayed and he had gone to him
id greeted him in the usual way. Sometimes both would display at the
me moment (this, when seen, was always shortly after the Blue-head had
splayed and been approached and greeted by the Firefinch) without
*parently noticing each other. The Firefinch frequently entered nest
uskets and gave his nest call, often after displaying, and he began to build
sts, or rather the rough outer shells of nests, in one site after another,
his behaviour has continued.
By April 1967 it was evident that the Firefinch was now very willing to
st the responsiveness of other individuals. From that time he frequently
splayed to both Blue-heads and Cordon-Bleus, usually to females but
metimes, in the case of Blue-heads, to males. Usually he would
rsistently follow and display to one individual for a time, but no doubt
dng to lack of response, he showed no consistent attraction for any one
rd. On 19th April I saw him, for the first time so far as I know, display
oeatedly to the Red-eared Waxbills. On the 22nd, ignoring both Red-
red W^axbills and the Uraeginthus species, he persistently displayed to
s hen Rosy-rumped Waxbill.
This sort of behaviour has continued. The male Firefinch steadfastly
nntained his responses to the male Blue-head Yellow Left, although
2se were, naturally, less evident when the latter was engaged in rearing
ung or incubating. He also displayed towards other individuals (Stem
splay) and nest-called and also showed other signs of both aggression and
vual interest towards both Estrilda and Uraeginthus species, more often
the latter. Although he built many unlined nests himself and showed
Tie interest in the nesting of " his " male Blue-head and the latter's
ite he did not, as I thought he might, show any inclination to incubate
lir e gg s or feed their young. Although he often took the stem or feather

he did not, so far as I saw, direct the Stem Display at this male Blue-head if
he (the Firefinch) had obtained the display symbol elsewhere. His be-
haviour towards this male Blue-head suggested that he was behaving in a
feminine or at any rate rather subordinate way towards him which ties up
with his having been moulting and consequently in a subdued state when
the attachment originally formed.
Although the Firefinch showed no sexual jealousy of " his " cock
Blue-head's mate, and never attempted to drive her away when both
were, for example, competing for position closest to the male Blue-head
when the latter displayed, I twice saw him show some aggression when the\
copulated. On April 27th 1967, I noticed the Blue-head pair were
copulating; the male was dislodged prematurely and at this moment the
Firefinch dashed up in what appeared to be the horizontal attacking posi-
tion but then froze in this crouched position a few inches from the Blue
heads. I had the impression that he would have attacked had the male
still been mounted when he reached them. On July 18th I again noticec
the Blue-head pair copulating when the cock was already mounted. Th&amp;lt;
Firefinch flew to them and froze facing them in a crouched posture abou
one foot away. He watched intently for a few seconds and then made 1
quick lunge forward but " stopped dead " about 6 in. from them. Thei
he darted forward again and the two Blue-heads fell off their perch,
think he had lunged at the female but not actually touched her and she ha&amp;lt;
fled, or tried to, capsizing them both. I think this behaviour was homo
logous with the interference with the copulation of conspecifics that i
shown, inter alia, by all the blue waxbills, and was not motivated by an
personal jealousy.
He remained thus attached to the indifferent but tolerant male Blue-hea&amp;gt;
Yellow Left until the latter died suddenly on 22nd April 1968. On Ma
7th, the Firefinch was seen responding eagerly (but fruitlessly) to th
display of another male Blue-head (Red Left) and, a little later, to
displaying male Cordon Bleu.
Since then he has not shown any definite " pairing to a particuk
individual. He clumps readily with Uraeginthus of either species an
sex but also often rests alone. He responds by approaching and giviri
his greeting display (or otherwise behaving as described in above accour
of his behaviour towards Yellow Left) to male Blue-heads, male Cordo
Bleus, female Blue-heads and female Cordon Bleus; apparently in the
order of preference. He gives his Stem Display, however, to both sex&amp;lt;
and, on the whole, I think rather more often to females than to males. I
the case of Cordon Bleus I am fairly certain that females are now (wintt
1968) preferentially displayed to. I have also had the impression, whic
may be wrong as I have done only short term watching of recent month
that his former preference for Blue-heads over Cordon Bleus has no
considerably waned. This may, however, be due to the fact that as, 1

- cent years, the Cordon Bleus have bred much more successfully than the
lue-heads they now outnumber them and also contain many more vigorous
)ung individuals among their number.
It has been v ery noticeable, however, that the Firefinch has become very
)t to go from one bird to another when alas, (as, is ever the case) he gets
d satisfactory response to his displays. For example: on 21st May 1968
j displayed very intensely to a female Cordon Bleu who let him come
ght up to her in his sidling jumps but showed no sexual interest or
sponse. He crouched lower and lower as he jumped, tilting his body
wards her, looking up to her and raising and fluttering his wings. The
ordon Bleu flew off; he followed her and began to display again, but
hen she flew a second time he turned to the Rosy-rumped Waxbill (the
me one that he had attempted to rape on her arrival over two years
eviously when she had been unable to fly) and displayed to her.
This Firefinch has shown himself in agreement with recent ornitho-
?ical opinion on the relationships of his family! Bereft of congenors he
sponded first, and still most frequently, to blue waxbills (Uraeginthus),
^ondly to Estrilda species, but has never shown the slightest sexual
terest in Avadavats or Gold-breasted Waxbills ( Amandava amandava
d A. subflava).
An interesting aspect of this cock Jameson's Firefinch's attachment to
s male Blue-headed Waxbill Yellow Left was that, from the first, he
owed a definite sexual reaction (the Greeting Display) when the Blue-
ad gave his Stem Display. So far as is known (Harrison 1956 and 1957,
)odwin 1964, Kunkel 1967a, p. 154) female firefinches, unlike females
the blue waxbills and typical waxbills ( Uraeginthus and Estrilda ), do
t give the Stem Display. Possibly, however, they may do so at times
ter all, some aviculturists have supposed, incorrectly, that the female
"rdon Bleu never gives this display) if the male is behaving inadequately,
if the female is more forward sexually. As female firefinches are
toriously more delicate in captivity than males (in strong contrast to
&apos;rdon Bleus) it probably rather seldom happens that an observant
culturist has a pair of any Lagonisticta species in which the female is
er and/or more forward in breeding condition than the male. I am not
refore, entirely convinced that female Lagonosticta never give the
&apos; m Display, because one has not yet been seen doing it.
[f they do not then we must assume that the cock Jameson's was showing
eminine response to the Blue-head's display. If on the other hand
lale firefinches do give the Stem Display in certain circumstances then
nay well supply an extra strong sexual stimulus to the male. In either
e the fact that this attachment formed when the Firefinch was moulting
1, probably, therefore in a rather sub-normal physical state is under-
adable.
Yhy this particular male Blue-head was the one the Firefinch fell in
e with (no inverted commas, waxbills do fall in love!) I have no idea but

it is fairly certain that, in this context, its sex was irrelevant. All available
observations suggest that male firefinches recognize another bird as &amp;lt;
male primarily by its having extensive areas of red or wine-colourec
plumage which, if worn by a firefinch, elicit aggression and sexual jealousy
from other males. If, therefore, a bird does not show such red or wine-
coloured plumage it will not usually (and probably not ever) elicit any o
the specific responses that a cock firefinch normally shows to males of hit
own (or allied and similarly coloured) species.
I can add little to my former notes (Goodwin 1964) on display and voici
of this species. As I then suspected " Stem Display " without the nes
symbol turned out to be low intensity display; at high intensity the bin
nearly always holds a piece of grass or feather in the usual way. Th&amp;lt;
rather crouched posture during the Stem Display is, however, characteristi
at all intensities, although I cannot say whether this is individual or specific
As in L. rubric at a, intermittent wing-fluttering may accompany the Ster
Display. A long, plaintive " feeeee " very like that of the female, ma
be uttered, as well or instead of the other calls previously described, b
the male during his Stem Display. It would be of interest to know if this
a typical call of the female, is only given in display when a conspecifi
female is not present.
The " feeee " call of the second hen virata was less long-drawn tha
that of the first. The nest-call of the male jamesoni is a soft, busk
" tchu-tchu-tchu-tchu-tchu . . .
On the Nesting of the jamesoni-virata pair
The nesting behaviour of the jamesoni male and the virata fema
seemed essentially similar to that of the Dark Firefinch (L. rubricate
which I described previously (Goodwin 1964). I only saw building t
the male and am not sure if the female even took in feathers for the nes
lining. I cannot now remember seeing her do so and I have no record i
my " Firefinch Notebook " of her doing so. The nests were like those "
rubric at a, with a very thick pad of feathers as lining. The female wou
readily lay, however, in a nest with few or no feathers, these were added j
and when they became available during incubation.
By day the male and female used to incubate for period of about /
minutes to an hour and a half with the male doing, perhaps, rather mo
than the female. I have several lists of times at which either was on tl
nest if anyone is particularly interested but, as these may well have bet
influenced by the rather artificial situation, it hardly seemed worth takii
up space to give them here. The hen always went on the nest an hour
more before dusk and stayed there until relieved by the male (or put off 1
me) next morning. The male always roosted well away from the nest.
When about to relieve ist mate, or when " thinking about " so doir
the bird would give the Alarm Call (" trrrrr, trrr-trr-trrt " by the mi

#Soni, " churrr, churrr-rrr " by the female virata) obviously here an
ression of conflict. Possibly the bird was often aware of my presence
dng through the Judas hole and this probably, and certainly in the case
he female, increased its hesitation to go to the nest. I never heard any
from the bird inside the nest although the one about to enter would
;n give Contact Calls. On all the occasions on which I saw change-over
relieving bird went into the nest before its mate came out. Often the
e brought a feather to the nest. I never saw the female try to snatch
om him as a hen blue waxbill often will in this situation,
rom the many clutches of eggs which were laid and they incubated
dfastly (there were also other clutches which were deserted because the
ale had had slight egg-binding) only one egg hatched. All other eggs
eared infertile when broken or possibly the embryos died at an
emely early stage. The one young one hatched on December 25th
5, the other three eggs appearing (when later broken) infertile. I
ized a young one had hatched at last when, first thing that morning, I
that the male was searching desperately about the room. Ants
as or any other really suitable natural food was out of the question at
time of year. I hastily put in some whiteworm culture and several
iefuls of earth and dead leaves from beneath the privet hedge in my
London garden.
he cock Firefinch began eagerly to search among all this debris but he
id very little to liking and ignored the whiteworms. To my horror he
I went to the millet tray and carefully selected the smallest grains he
d find, swallowing them whole without de-husking them. Dark and
eson's Firefinches and blue waxbills normally consume a lot of the
II panicum millet without removing the husk. I also, of course, put
gg food and milk sop without any hope that the Firefinches would
h it; nor did they, except with their feet when they hopped over it. I
k that if some seed like millet but much smaller were available this
it be a great help in waxbill breeding.

By W. Collard and D. Collard
(Natal Zoological Gardens, Amanzimtoti, Natal)
3 n the 20th August 1968 we acquired two Lilac-breasted Rollers
racias candata , and as the sexes of these birds are alike we naturally did
know whether they were a pair. It was with pleasure that some two
nths later they were observed feeding each other, and we now knew that
east they were of opposite sex. Eventually it was decided to hang up
Dllow log in their aviary. We did not hold out much hope, but at least
y would have the opportunity to nest.
)n observing the writer's actions our head keeper ventured the opinion
t they probably had eggs already, as he had noticed they were continually
1 nest put up for the Lorikeets sharing their aviary. This nest consisted
a tin measuring 10 in. x 10 in. by 15 in. deep, and lined with wood
h a round hole near the top. A ladder was immediately sent for and to
profound delight, the nest contained two almost round white eggs,
is was the 4th November and as we did not know the exact date on
ich they were laid we were unable to ascertain the incubation period.
)n the 17th, 13 days later, both eggs hatched and our task of finding
ugh live food commenced. We would mention that from the outset
hen was always very tame and ate from our hands. Both parents were
ellent feeders, the hen taking the cockroaches, mealworms and crickets
n our hand to the nest, whilst the cock was supplied by throwing these
; cts onto the top of the wire which he caught in flight as they fell
rngh.
\ T t always knew when the chicks had had enough, because the parents
ild eat the insects themselves.
bout a week after the hatching, a Blue-headed Parrot, also an inmate
tiis aviary, chewed a hole through the wire, but the only bird to escape
the Roller cock. While we were bemoaning our fate, he suddenly
eared on top of the aviary with an insect in his beak and trying to find
ay in. A trap cage was set with mealworms which he immediately
red much to our relief. At this stage we were supplying food about
or six times a day, no food could be left in the aviary for them to feed
leir leisure, as it was shared with, amongst others, a Colombian Jay and
e Cape Glossy Starlings, who would have made short work of the
cts.
n the 6th December, tragedy struck. It was noticed that the Rollers

The area around the nest was fumigated and the box itself thoroughly
cleaned out. The surviving chick was put back and the nest hung on the
wall again. Whilst all this was happening, the hen viciously attacked the
writer. We now started supplying the live food again, but neither parents
were interested in feeding the baby. Regretfully it was decided aftei
about an hour of endeavour to hand feed the youngster. The hen must
have read my thoughts, for she suddenly made her usual chucking noise
and looked up at the nest-box with an uneaten cockroach in her beak, and
with a sigh of relief, we watched her commence feeding duties again. The
cock bird eventually followed suit.
On the 22nd December, the chick left the nest fully coloured except thai
the lilac on the breast was duller, and the elongated outer tail feathers were
absent. The parents continued to feed for about another ten days with
the baby often joining the mother and feeding from the writer's hand. Ii

The pair of Little Owls in the Norfolk Wildlife Park were presentei
originally by children who had found them as nestlings which had appar
ently been abandoned. The female arrived in 1965 and the male in 1967
The aviary is in a sheltered corner of the Park and is of irregular shap
25 ft. in length, 9 ft. wide and 8 ft. high. A grass grown bank runs th
full length and an artificial burrow has been constructed running two fee
into the bank and ending in a chamber 12 in. by 9 in. in area. Thi
chamber can be cleaned out by means of a steel lid covered by a sod of turf
The entrance to the burrow is beneath an old tree stump close to an elde
bush while other shrubs and an apple tree have been planted in the aviary
The Owls are fed almost entirely on chopped up day old chicks and ea
an average of five chicks between them per day.
During May 1968 the female spent most of the time in the nest burro\
and was seldom seen. On the 20th of the month the chamber wa
inspected and found to contain three eggs. No further inspections wer
made at this time for fear of disturbing the birds, but by the middle 0
June food consumption had risen to eight chicks per day and so it wa

pened and had in it two fully fledged owlets. By the end of the month
ley were both seen regularly in the evenings although they would dive
awn the burrow the moment they noticed anyone approaching. How-
er they gradually become more confident and one or both sometimes
*mained sitting in the shrubs during the daytime.
At the end of September the young were removed to a separate aviary,
hey weighed 7J ozs. and 8J ozs. so are probably a pair. At the time-of
riting (December 1968) both are thriving and it is hoped they will breed

By C. J. O. Harrison (Perivale, Middlesex, England)
For students of bird behaviour, collections of birds in aviaries are of
nsiderable value, making it possible to study behaviour in greater detail
birds which may be less affected by the presence of the observer than
[Id ones, and to check for the occurrence of particular forms of behaviour
a range of species that might otherwise never be encountered alive by
ne person.
A few years ago when studying allopreening (or mutual preening as it is
metimes called) I found it necessary to rely heavily on observations of
1 iary birds in order to discover the extent to which it occurred in different
: nilies. There was evidence of it in thirty-nine different families (Harrison
65). Since then Sparks (1965) has observed it in two more families
ien watching birds at the London Zoo, and more recently I have recorded
im yet another family, the observations being again based on aviary birds.
1 the information below I have summarized both my own observations
d those of others in order to bring the original paper up to date.

FALCONIDAE. Sparks (1965) recorded allopreening by a pair of
1 d-thighed Falconets, Microhierax caerulescens , which performed this
ivity when clumping close together on a perch. He also recorded it
&amp;gt;m Forster's Milvago, Phalcoboenus australis , and from a pair of

irs of these species did not clump together; and that in the latter species

the eye and bare skin around the base of the bill.
TYTONIDAE. Information on this behaviour in owls as a whole
rather scanty. I have only one previous record. I have now seen it
an aviary in the London Zoo containing four Barn Owls, Tyto alb
offspring of another zoo pair which had reared two young in each of ti
two previous years. All four birds perched fairly close together, almost
contact. Shortly after they began to preen themselves late one afternoo
random allopreening occurred. The photograph (shows one of tl
birds which had been preening its nestmate on the left turning its attentk
to the bird on its right. The plumage was mostly allopreened around tl
edges of the facial discs and around the base of the bill.
PRIONOPIDAE. Sparks (op. cit.) records both clumping and all
preening in the Plumed Helmet-shrike, Prionops plumata , a pair of whk
were kept in a cage at the zoo.
PLOCEIDAE. Allopreening does not normally occur among tl
weavers, but Kunkel (1966) has recorded it in the two Sporopipes speck
the Speckle-fronted Weaver, Sporopipes frontalis , and the Scaly-crowm
Weaver, S. squamifrons. These birds may clump together when restii
and also roost communally when not in breeding pairs, cramming ther
selves into small domed nests. Among unpaired birds the allopreenii
tended to be random, but in the pairs it was normally the dominant bi
that did most of the preening, and at the nesting period this was norma!
the female. The preening was restricted to the head feathers. The
birds are often grouped with the sparrows, and thought to be nearer t
simple, ancestral type of weaver, possibly forming a link between t
weavers and the waxbill family.

It was found that allopreening was usually correlated with certa
factors in the environment or in the birds' normal pattern of behavioi
It was most frequently correlated with environmental factors whi
caused the birds to remain in close physical proximity or contact with ea
other, particularly when this occurred at the nest-site. Both the Re
thighed Falconet and the Barn Owl are species which nest in hollow trt
or cavities in which enforced close proximity could be a significant fact&amp;lt;
In the case of the Milvago and Caracara this factor would not apply, b
another which also appears to be a correlate of this behaviour and whi
may be relevant here is that many birds which maintain a persistent pa
bond over a long period also tend to show allopreening. In the case
the Helmet-shrikes a third correlate seems to be involved. These bir
resemble the babblers in their tendency to form close and highly social
groups which move about together, clump together when resting, and n&amp;lt;
as a sociable group; and such species, which experience physical proxim
to each other similar to that of birds on a restricted nest-site although fit

Dtives other than physical necessity, also tend to allopreen. The allo-
-eening factors of two weaver species would appear to show elements of
)th the socialibility of the babblers and the enforced proximity factor of
ie raptors.
Information on another species which appears to show correlation of
lopreening with a restricted nest-site, is given in a study of the Swallow-
iied Gull, Creagrus furcatus (Snow and Snow 1968), though not from
iptive birds. This species, which nests in the Galapagos, is peculiar,
nong other reasons, in that it tends to choose small clilf-ledges for nests
though other apparently usable and more extensive sites may appear to
i available. Possibly as a result of this it shares with the Kittiwake, Rissa
idactyla , many characters associated with adaptation to nesting on small
dges, and the Swallow-tailed Gull and the Kittiwake appear to be the
lly two gull species which allopreen.

In collecting observations I noted at times behaviour in species which
id not allopreen which nevertheless bore a strong resemblance to it and
)peared to be intermediate between pecking and preening behaviour,
his was observed in captive dunnocks, Prunella species, among others
iarrison 1966). More recently I have observed similar behaviour from
pair of hand-reared Skylarks, Alauda arvensis. These were separated
tiysically, but in sight of each other, for two weeks soon after they began
&amp;gt; feed themselves. Subsequently, when they were put together again,
ie bird already in possession of the enclosure approached the other in a
ither aggressive manner. The other bird became quite motionless and
ie first performed this very gentle pecking or touching, barely appearing
" do more than touch with the bill, around the eyes and on the crown of
ie motionless bird.
The only record I have of apparent allopreening in cranes is a record by
erek Goodwin (pers. comm.) of a captive Crowned Crane, Balearica
gulorum, pecking gently among the crest feathers of the lowered head of
lother individual; and I was able to observe precisely similar behaviour
ore recently by a pair at the London Zoo. This again appears to be
)rderline behaviour which does not clearly fall into one category or the

After losing these two chicks I increased the live food supply (me;

The pair then built a third nest in another bush three feet from t

In case some of the Society's new or older members missed Mr. C. J. O.
Harrison's article in Vol. 74, No. 1 Jan-Feb. 1968, on the reason why the
Council of the Avicultural Society felt that a census of the Rothschild's
Vlynah be taken among its Members, and a register of all known captive
Leucopsar rothschildi be made, it is because of the doubts felt about the
possible survival of this lovely bird in its limited natural habitat on the
Northern part of the Island of Bali, Indonesia.
Whilst the Council of the Avicultural Society realize that no-one has
iucceeded in maintaining a viable population of any " softbill " under
tviary conditions, and the difficulties are recognized, it is felt that taken in
ime and on a wide enough basis, it may be possible to establish this bird.
I have been greatly encouraged in this work, not only from the response
)f private members in this country, but also from abroad, and I would
ike to thank especially Mr. Kenton C. Lint, (Curator of Birds at San
ffiego Zoo, California), Mr. C. R. Schmidt, (Associate Assistant at Zurich
ffio) and Mrs. K. M. Scamell of Newdigate, Surrey, all consistent and
uccessful breeders of this species for the detailed information they have,
ent me. To Mr. Roger Van Oosten (Vice-President of Tacoma Zoologi-
al Society, Washington), my thanks for his interest in our project, which
e hopes the Society will make a permanent one, and that it may
onsider setting up a Stud Book on these birds.
I agree we should aim at starting a Stud Book at some future date, not, I
ope, too far distant, but I would not recommend the Council to adopt this
roject until it has been proved possible to maintain a breeding population of
iis Mynah in captivity. So far as I can see from the records at my disposal,
oung Rothschild's have yet to be bred from two aviary-bred parents.
tS soon as we receive proof that this has been accomplished I think the
me would have come to consider starting a Stud Book. In the meantime
would like to hear of as many Rothschild's Mynahs as possible being ringed
ith split rings, so they can be put on after leaving the nest, and so that
lere is some means of identifying individual birds and their movements
om one owner to another; also in preparation for the creating of a Stud
00k when thought fit, since then it will be necessary to be able to identify
1 individuals accurately.
If Aviculturists can maintain and increase the number of this species in
mfinement, then perhaps the improving climate of opinion for the role of
ptivity-breeding in conservation will be further advanced.

August 1967) 34 Zoos had between them a total of 129* of which 29 had
been bred in confinement. In Vol. 9, for 1969 (census compiled between
Feburary and June 1968), 36 Zoos had between them a total of 115" of
which 39 were captive bred, making a total of 52 when added to those bred
in private collections in this country.
I am greatly indebted to Mr. Joseph Lucas, Editor of the Internationa!
Zoo Year Book, for giving me permission to use information on the num-
bers of L. rothschildi in world Zoos, contained in Vols. 8 and 9, in order tc
make the following register, which locates the pairs and individual L.
rothschildi in captivity in Zoological Gardens and in private collections as
complete as possible. There are believed to be considerably more of these
birds in captivity, particularly in private collections, that have not so fai
been reported, and we shall be most grateful for any information about
them that would help to make this register more complete, as would alsc
any further information about the housing, breeding and feeding techniques
used by successful breeders that could be included in the next report.
Before finishing this article I must acknowledge the great amount 0;
work done and assistance given me by our member, Mr. David Spilsbury
in assembling the following register.

there was some degree of natural selection. In 1966 six
young in three nests were reared. In 1966 and 1967 the
two odd males died and this seemed to destroy the
community balance (one male, one adult female and three
young females) amongst the Mynahs. Breeding did not
begin until the young were removed. In 1967 only one

By C. J. O. Harrison (Perivale, Middlesex, England)
ASPEBA, the Association for the Study and Propagation of European
Birds in Aviaries, originated as an idea of Frank Meaden's. He had long
wanted to form an organization to try to bring together those who were
genuinely interested in keeping, breeding and studying our native birds in
aviaries. I had had relatively little to do with British birds but became
interested and helped to launch this association in 1965. At the prelimi-
nary discussion it was decided that Europe formed a more obvious and lest
parochial unit than Britain, and, in an attempt to define our aim, I must
admit to being guilty of the mnemonic title.
As a relative newcomer to this aspect of aviculture I was keen to know
what species could be bred and perpetuated in aviaries. Unfortunate!)
the desire to swell the list of birds allegedly bred and hence available for
exhibition seemed to have led in the past to some dubious claims of success-
ful breeding, and I had reached a stage of scepticism where I had come tc
doubt if anything much could be, or was, actually bred under aviary
conditions. I was therefore very interested to see what the breeding
results would be among our members. Aviculturists are notoriously bad
at putting pen to paper and we usually only had returns from some 16 to i#

season. This seems to be due mainly to the fact that a single brood of
such young are likely to require all the small insect and fine food available at
that period, and the breeder is also likely to concentrate on giving every
advantage to the pair that have shown such promise. It is not, however,
true that the pair on which most care is lavished will be the ones most
likely to breed. The second interesting fact that emerges is that with the
less frequently bred species most of the successes have been with birds
which were either hand-reared as young, or at least reared under aviary
conditions. This is the opposite view to that held by breeders of such
birds at the turn of the century who held that success was most likely with
freshly-trapped adults. I suspect, and hope, that this reflects our more
effective rearing and subsequent care of birds in aviaries compared with
earlier days.

figure for birds was 942. In our Tropical House some of the smaller
species were found to have increased in numbers, although no nests were
found. In such a vast building there are many hatchings which gc
undetected and if a flock of a relatively short-lived species maintains its
numbers they are obviously breeding to compensate for those which die.
Two very rare breedings were recorded: a Superb Bird of Paradise
(Lophorma superba feminina) and two Kookaburras (Dacelo gigas) and we
are pleased to report that these birds are thriving. Other species to be
reared during 1968 were: Sclater's Crested Curassow, Muscovy Duck

Bar-headed Geese, Great Eagle-Owl, Turquoisine and Barraband Parra-
keet, Silver and Golden Pheasant, Peacock, Bob-white Quail, Gloss)
Starling, Mute Swan, Sundervall's and Red-eared Waxbill.
We are very pleased that the young Curassow is a female as those bred ir
previous years were all males. The young bird developed the mottlec
black, white and brown plumage of the adult female as soon as she lost hei
down. Our male youngsters acquired black feathers after losing the
brown coloured down and were also readily identified by the bright yellov
cere, which is far smaller and less brightly coloured in female birds.
During the winter months few new arrivals are acquired for our Birc

An Australian Stone Curlew or Thicknee ( Burhinus magnirostris ) that
.as received in November 1945 and has recently died, was a bird that was
1 the Leckford Collection before 1939. It occasionally, even in recent
ears, laid an egg.
Among the early nesting birds are Grey-headed Gallinules, Javan Fish-
&amp;gt;wls, Kenya, Spotted and Great Eagle-Owls. The Javan Fish-Owl
atched a chick which did not survive, but perhaps, as before, a second
esting will take place. This pair has always nested very early in the year.
Arrivals of particular interest are a specimen of North African Little
&amp;gt;wl (Athene noctua glaux), six Red-headed Laughing Thrushes (Garrulax
ythrocephalus) a pair of Ultramarine or Brazilian Blue Grosbeaks, a
edwing found in Essex unable to fly due to loss of flight feathers of one
mg, and a Scarlet-backed Flowerpecker (Dicaeum c. cruentatum ) brought
om Singapore by our member Mr. Alan Booth.

lieved that seven made the " big jump ", each landing safely and full of

BREEDING THE WOODPIGEON

[ When bringing together records of native species in captivity I found that then
was little or no evidence of the breeding of the Woodpigeon, Columba palumbus
Derek Goodwin informed me that they had been bred by the Hon. Miriam Roths
child, to whom I wrote, and who has kindly supplied the following information
Asst. Hon. Ed.]
It is quite true that I have bred the woodpigeon in captivity, but to write it u]
seems hardly necessary because there was no secret about it. The procedure was a
I caught the woodpigeons as nestlings and hand reared them, feeding them 01
bread and milk and adding the usual extras such as codliver oil, premature bab;
food and so forth. In those days we did not have antibiotics, but I suppose it
was to hand-rear a bird today I would always add a little aureomycine to the bre\
in the early stages. When the birds were adult I released them in a large aviary
Whether they bred or not depended on the number of birds to the square yard
there was no breeding if they were so numerous that they formed a flock ; sooner 0
later under these circumstances one or two birds became aggressive and killed th
others--then the remaining birds would breed quite successfully.
I found that the woodpigeon does not only lay two eggs, as we are so olten told 11
the literature, but will lay up to 22 eggs if one of the pair is removed soon afte
laying. Derek Goodwin may have told you that I found a tremendous differenc
between the tamability of some woodpigeons and others, and I would strong!
suggest that if anyone wishes to start breeding woodpigeons in captivity they choos
a strain which is genetically suited to tamability,--that is to say woodpigeons fror
one of the parks in London. Those you get from the fields in areas in the Midlands
where we live and where they are shot at over decoys, appear to be tame in th
early stages, but then become wild and very soon damage themselves in aviaries.
Although my woodpigeons laid perfectly happily in small cages nearer the groun
there is no doubt they are much happier in a tall aviary where they can nest near th
wire roofing, and it is much better to give them a plank on which to nest than leav
them in the branches because they are very poor nest builders in captivity.
I am sure, however, that far the most important thing is to get your stock from
London park, or somewhere where the genes for tameness have not been eliminate!
As vou probably know, the same applies to starlings--there is an enormous vanet
in tamebility among starlings and we always have to get rid of the wild ones.
If any of your fellow aviculturists start breeding the woodpigeon 1 think the
would be interested to note how diet affects the colour of their plumage. I he&amp;gt;
changes may be rather subtle, but very definite once you are familiar with the bin

An enquiry from the Assistant Editor concerning the breeding of Nightingali
prompted me to refer to my notes, compiled in conjunction with the late
Emelius Hopkinson. , ,
Karl Neunzig (Einheimische Stubenvogel, p. 30 (1913) says that the earliest recoi
of their breeding is to be found in Brehm's " Handbuch " (p. 78), i.e. early in
1 oth century, and that they have often been bred since. (Presumably in German)
For the United Kingdom the earliest record is contained in Proc. Loot. 00
London, 1851, p. 196 (recorded in Yarrell's British Birds, 4th Ed., vol. 1, P- 3

about a week's time he had the satisfaction of seeing the hen with an oak-leaf in
bill. She made her nest in one of the small cages, laid four eggs and brought up
ee young
Then in Bird Notes (F.B.C.), 1906, p. 44, 79, there is some correspondence about
ir breeding by a Mr. Jeffrey, of Mill Street, Kidderminster, in " just a range of
*n sheds and enclosures ... In each compartment was a single pair of birds ".
;oncludes with the statement: " For some years, at any rate, their owner is said
lave been successful in breeding them, and in getting the young reared." There
lothing to show when the breeding took place or whether it was recorded any-
ere at the time.
^ater, however, in Avicult. Mag., 1912, p. 170-171, there is a letter from J.
:rey in which he describes his success, accompanying his account with an extract
n the Birmingham Weekly Post , 22nd July, 1899. Jeffrey says that a Mr. Sills,
Leicester, was successful in 1911; young were successfully reared "which he
&amp;gt;es to breed from this season ". An account of the event is said to have been
t to Cage Birds. Jeffrey's own record is rather indefinite, especially as to dates,
it must be accepted for what it is worth.
mother record is given by Wesley T. Page in Bird Notes (F.B.C.), 1911, p. 264;
breeder being E. A. Mallett, of Barnsley: " This season five young birds were
ched, which left the nest on June 10, one died on June 27, the remaining four
still living (August), have moulted out and are in exhibition condition ". An
aunt by the breeder appeared in Canary and Cage-bird Life , 8th Sept., 1911.
&amp;quot;here is a good account of their breeding in France by N. Mayer, in UOiseau ,

v Australian King Parakeets were again disappointing. The hen came into

I had supposed this would be the end of the 1968 season but some weeks later
thought the hen looked broody and in looking into the box found two eggs whic
were warm. That night she was in the box, and subsequently sat tightly with onl
one or two " forgetful " spells when I had to put her into the box after dark. Th
cause of this, I believe, is that she gets so excited when flying back and forth wit
the cock at dusk that she just reverts to her regular habit of going to roost instead c
to the nest. When she is broody she will step onto a stick after dark, and by gentl
holding her tail with one hand, holding the stick with the other, and with a flash
light under my chin, I am able to put her head in the hole and she will then dim
down and cover the eggs. In all she laid three eggs and hatched and raised thre
chicks in normal fashion with the help of the cock. The elder Rudkin once wrot
to me that he thought that it was the " extras " that many times made the differenc
between success and failure in aviculture. I always thought of his observations a
pertaining to food but I guess he meant it in a broader sense.
In the summer of 1967 I had obtained three Crimson-wing parrots bred tha
spring. In the fall of 1968 they moulted into one fully coloured male, one mal
with about half of his black and red colour, and the third male showing about te
black feathers in his mantle. I thought this rather unusual.

world-famed Glaxo Company which alone makes this possible. This firm has produced
hny granules which contain the fantastic amount of 325,000 International Food Units-

Choline and Biotin. Only foods containing all these vitamins, in appropriate quantities
can be termed COMPLETE. quanm.es.
This sensational development also contains HI-PROTEIN-PLUS which you will see is itself
a water-soluble food containing 85% animal protein. Protein is life itself; without it
there would be no living creatures at all. It is essential for the maintenance of body
tissues and bones which have to be constantly reinforced, this is done by metabolism.--

of which are manufactured within the body; there are ten, however, that cannot be so
produced these are called ESSENTIAL Amino-Acids. They are as follows:- Arginine,
H.shdme, Lysme Trypotophone, Phenylalanine, Valine, Methionine, Leucine, Isoleucine
and Threnme. The combination of all these essentials in the Nectar Granules ensures
complete nutrition to all species of nectarines.

In December, 1966, I was fortunate enough to secure a male of each of
he manakins shown on the accompanying plate. These two along with
ix other manakins of two different species are presently housed in my
ollection. These birds are very hard to obtain even today and those that
0 become available bring a high price. The main reason for this is that
key, in the wild are very localized in their habitat, although their distribu-
ion may cover a wide area. According to a belief held by Mr. Charles
:ordier these birds are only maintainable during certain times of the year,
he) can be trapped usually during most of the year, but are extremely
ard to keep alive except during certain periods. While in Ecuador I mist-
etted two female Blue-rumped Manakins (Pipra isidorei ) but even with
)rce-feeding I was only able to keep them alive for a few days.
The family Pipridae is exclusively tropical American and has some 52
lembers in it. There still may possibly be one or two species yet to
iscover in the vast area of the Amazon drainage, as Dr. Helmut Sick
iveral years ago discovered a new species in Brazil. They are, in most
ises, small, brightly coloured birds which inhabit the thick under-
1 *wth of the forest or the lower canopy of the forest. They vary in size
om that of a small wren to that of a sparrow. They feed mostly on fruit
id especially berries and also insect life. The sexes are usually different
1 colour with the male sporting all the colour, while the females are mostly
rab shades of green. Most have elaborate displays and display areas and
e very often referred to as the " Birds of Paradise " of the new world,
tales display for most of the year on their courts except when they are
oulting. They likewise are polygynous in that they do not pair for life
for a breeding season. Further they do not share in the duties of
hiding a nest, incubating the eggs nor feeding or rearing of the young.
&amp;gt; mentioned, they have and maintain display courts for years on end and
ere hold court to attract the females, mating, in many cases w T ith more
an one female. By the same token a female may visit more than one
ale on his court. Their vocal sounds are unimpressive considering the

whole family, but some do produce a loud snapping noise with their wings
when going through their display, which sounds like a crack of a rifle.
Manakins have a short and very rapid flight which is extremely hard to
follow. Also many of the members of the family make a whirr sound
when they fly, this sound being produced by the feathers of the wings.
They are generally speaking very active birds constantly on the move.
The Golden-headed Manakin (.Pipra erythrocephala berlepschi ) was
trapped east of Banos in the Pastaza River valley in Ecuador. The
species itself is very widespread from the Guianas, Brazil north of the
Amazon through to Colombia and eastern Panama and then south and
east of the Andes through Ecuador to northern Peru. Also a sub-species
is found on the island of Trinidad. It lives in the tropical and lower
subtropical zones in the undergrowth of the forest. The altitude of the
zones runs from sea level up to 4500-5500 feet. The plate shows the
general colour of the bird and hence only a few minor points should be
mentioned. The bird is about four inches long and in this sub-species the
head is yellow with a very faint scarlet border across the nape. The other
noticeable colour is that of the thighs which also are scarlet. One other
stand-out feature of this bird is the clear and sharp eye which gives it a
very alert appearance, as if nothing can escape its notice. The female is
generally olive green overall. Since I have had the male no display has
been done by the bird. The only sound I have heard my male make is a
sharp chee-weep. This either in a single call or a double one. However,
none of the movements associated with the display have ever been seen.
The Golden-winged Manakin (Masius chrysopterus chrysopterus) was
collected in the same area as the preceding species. This species ranges
from Venezuela in the northwest, throughout Colombia to north-eastern
Peru. In Ecuador it is found on both the western and eastern sides of the
Andes. They live in the forests of the upper tropical and subtropical
zones, in altitude ranging from about 3500 feet to 7500-8500 feet. Here
again the plate shows the bird off well as far as colour goes. However, a
few very interesting points should be mentioned. The frontal feathers
over the bill remain in that position and are not laid back, thus giving the
appearance of a " horn ". The plate shows the bird in the excited attitude
with his crest feathers raised. These feathers are rather long and the hind
crown ones are red. On each side of the golden-yellow crown the black
side crowm feathers rise giving the appearance of a set of oryx horns.
When the bird is excited then the crown feathers assume the position as
shown on the plate with either the yellow and red crown feathers lying flat
on the head or raised as shown. Of course when normal then all crown
feathers will lie flat against the head. It is further possible that these
feathers are used during their display but thus far to the best of my know-
ledge no one has observed its display either in the wild or in captivity.
Also under the chin and on the breast as well as under wing-coverts and
also the inner margins of the remiges and rectrices the bird sports additional

ded this bird has shown no display behaviour whatsoever while he has

such as pyracantha and cotoneaster are also relished by manakins as v
as cotingas, tanagers and honeycreepers.
Newly imported birds are fed the above along with Terramycin in F;
Formula (Chas. Pfizer &amp; Co.) sprinkled over it. The terramycin is fed i
one week and if the birds still feel or look a little bad then it is continii
for several more days. This particular product seems to quiet them do
after the trip and also bring them out of the state of shock which mi
birds are in upon arrival. Another product that I feed to them is C i-
thaxanthin (Hoffmann-LaRoche) and this is sprinkled on their food dur;
the moulting season. This acts as a colour retainer during that per;
and hence my birds do not fade as the majority of reds, yellows and oranji
do in captivity. Thus the two manakins herewith discussed look today
they did the day they were caught. It should also be noted that manak:
like to bathe and in particular the Golden-winged which does so every c,
as soon as I change the drinking water dish. In the summer when I r
the stream then he dives right in and soaks himself until it is impossible :i
him to fly.
In the wild these birds consume a great many insects, but as yet I hi.
been unable to get them to eat either mealworms, maggots or fruit fli
I have even gone to the trouble of catching flies, moths and other inse:
for them, but again no interest has been shown in them. The one exc&amp;lt;
tion to this was the Golden-winged Manakin which upon arrival was sc
to hawk a few fruit flies every now and then but no longer does it. Tb
it would seem that apparently the above mixture coupled with n
hummingbird formula, which is available to them, supplies all the noun:
ment that they need. I say this because of the lack of interest shown
all my manakins in any form of insect life.
All in all they are wonderful birds and I can recommend them to anyc
who may be fortunate enough to secure some. They are a star attract
in any collection especially when they display.
This article will be continued at a later date mentioning some of 1
other members of the family w hich I have in my collection. I am howe &amp;lt;
including a partial reference list now for those who wish to read m&amp;lt;
about the family--Pipridae.

(Sturnus pagodarum)
By A. W. Bowden (Haverhill, Suffolk, England)
had been keeping a number of birds--canaries, budgerigars, small
"ign seedeaters and Pekin Robins--for some years, mainly for show
poses; but began to find the small seedeaters a nuisance and got rid of
m, buying instead a Pagoda Starling, Sturnus pagodarum. This was a
d bird that did very well at shows, beating a pair of the same species
led by a friend. I wanted a mate for it and bought a hen from a bird
n. This bird was in rough condition when it arrived. It remained
gh for as long as I had it.
put both birds out in the spring of 1967 in an aviary 6 ft. x 6 ft. with a
. x 3 ft. covered shed, nice and cosy and warm for nights. I also put
with them a pair of Glossy Starlings that my wife had bought me for
istmas, and they all appeared to get on well together. Shortly after this
friend, who was moving, offered me his pair of Pagoda Starlings,
iwing that they were good I snapped them up, brought them home and,
&amp;quot;St July, put them into the aviary with the other birds, also putting in a
-box in which my friend s pair used to sleep. This was an ordinary
gerigar breeding box, with no concave in the bottom inside, but with a
e hay which had been carried in by the birds from the flight.
&apos;n 29th July there was a rare old scuffle in the aviary. I could not be
5 if this was mating or fighting; but shortly after I noticed that the cock

which looked dead. I jumped into the aviary quickly and both birds i,
up. I took out both my friend's hen and the scruffy hen; and fn
subsequent evidence it would appear that my original " cock " was a i
and had paired with the cock of my friend's pair. They had taken c:
the nest-box and were nesting. My friend had tried to achieve this \
two years, and now it had happened in less than a month.
The nest was completed with leaves from a blackcurrant bush that t
planted in the aviary. Once breeding commenced the Pagoda Starli
would not tolerate the Glossy Starlings in the flight but would attack thi
and drive them back into the shed.
On 7th August I could hear some squeaks from the box but dared "
look in case I upset the birds. An egg-shell, which I saw when the cl
pitched it out of the box, was about the size of a quail egg, and light blu&amp;lt;t
colour. The weather was quite good, hot days and warm nights, I
buying maggots for my quails, and put some down for the starlings. &apos;]"
latter started taking two or three at a time to feed whatever was the
On nth August it poured with rain and the nest box became soaked fron
leak in the aviary roof. This necessitated getting on top of the aviary 2:
securing a piece of corrugated P.V.C. over the leak, which did the job, 2:
mercifully the birds seemed all right. They were still feeding somethi
I was putting in maggots three times a day now and this was gett i
expensive, so I decided to try and breed my own from rotten meat, at 1;
bottom of the garden. The starlings would not take the small ones thal
was producing, only taking the larger ones. I had to keep on buying th"i
in. I could not get enough, but after a time I noticed that thay we
taking the pupae as food for the young. The droppings of the you;
which were brought out were always lain on a sill in the aviary, never on t
floor.
At last, on 28th August, out came a young Pagoda Starling, onto t
floor of the flight. It was just as with children, with dad showing what&apos;
do; the cock flying up onto the perch, the young one trying to folio
falling down several times, but finally making it. Within twenty-fo
hours the youngster was flying from one perch to another, and sleeping
between times. It was fed by its parents for another week, apparent
entirely on maggots, for I never saw anything else given. Then it becar
more independent. The parents tried to feed it but it appeared not
want them to. They would try, but it preferred to feed itself, witho
being forced.
On 12th September, the hen was sitting again I do not know when s)
laid again for I had not missed her until then. As soon as the hen start*
to settle to her second round of eggs the cock had started chasing the fir
young one and would, I believe, have killed it if I had not removed it. C
18th September feeding with single maggots began. On 20th September t!
cock brought out a dead young one in its bill which, from its shape, looke
as though it had died before getting out of the shell. On 23rd Septernb 1

they were feeding young again on maggots, maggots and more maggots.,
On nth October a young one was out but did not look too good. Its feet
were badly deformed and it could not stand and I had to destroy it. To
my regret two further young, which emerged on 15th and 19th October
respectively, were also badly affected in the same way.
I think that their diet was less varied in October, unlike August when
lies were available, more wasps on fruit, and caterpillars on cabbage leaves.
1 he main diet that I gave them was Sluis Universal Food and loads of
ishing maggots; and in addition fruit--orange and apple, a few sultanas,
md red currants and black currants.
The first young one has turned out to be a fine cock. It has a brilliant
-or.g and is quite tame, allowing anyone to coax its head if it is done slowly
vithout frightening it; and it has won prizes at several shows.

To me, as a I hai, the accounts of aviculture in temperate countries are
lways as fascinating as they are bewildering. The terrors of the winter
- ason with its attendant maladies, need for radical changes in bird housing
ad avian food shortages--particularly shortages of insects--are almost
icomprehensible to those who live in the tropics.
Thailand is particularly fortunate for its phlegmatic seasons. Some
nglish folk here, I know, say " Oh for a cold wind and the sight of snow "!
ut I doubt if the birds share their view. There are seasons here, of
)urse, but just sufficient to trigger off the day-length, thermo-regulated
id humidotrophic mechanisms upon which most of nature depends,
ur mean minimum is 68&apos;&amp;quot; F and our mean maximum 95 0 F, there is a
x month wet season, but it does not rain every day nor does it ever rain
1 day; it does not rain but it pours "--and gets it over with, mean
ind speed is 3 to 4 knots with little monthly variation, i.e. a more-or-less
Tennial zephyr. In case you think this is subliminal tourist propaganda,
t me hasten to draw the inferences in avian terms. If your birds are
ly enough to stay out in the rain (as my Gouldians are) there is no follow-
1 icy blast to quick-freeze them. The constantly high humidity is
surance enough, and most times the sun will come out, and so offset any
aporative cooling (worse luck!).
I hailand has other features as well, which favour aviculture. There is,
r example, only a relative minimum of restriction on the external trade
birds. Export is wisely controlled of the Great Argus Pheasant, the

Peacock Pheasant, the Black Stork, the Black-headed Stork, the White-
necked Stork, the Sarus Crane, the Spotted-bill Pelican, the Comb Duck
the White-winged Wood-duck and the Roul Roul. Moreover, Thailanc
has, in its own right, many desirable indigenous species of cage-birds,
furthermore, such is the economic structure of the country that most ol
the appurtenances of aviculture are cheap and abundant.
There are, of course, some drawbacks. First, the market is " thin "
so that prices of individual species of birds tend to be anomalously high:
a pair of Golden Pheasants here for example, costs about 2000 baht; in;
Australia, I note they are quoted at about 350 baht. Yet they are freel)
importable here but banned from import in Australia. There is also a
dearth of cage-bird societies and of detailed literature on the hobby. The
worst drawback, however, is the ant-based ecology of the place, in some
ways this is a good thing, Australians, for example, who come here never
cease to be amazed at the almost complete absence of flies; fresh meat
can be hawked in the street without any danger of being " blown ", the
main reason seems to be that whenever any organic matter falls to the
ground, ants pounce upon it before any fly pupae can emerge.
So far as bird-keeping is concerned, ants are an awful nuisance. Let a
bird fall off its perch at night and unless you hear its cries for help and
rescue it quickly it will be nothing but a pile of bones and feathers by
morning, they are extremely vicious and attempts to succour a bird just
newly-attacked means that you yourself will be covered in tiny stings, ants
are insidious--none to-day; a whole swarm tomorrow--I find water
dispersible dieldrin acts quickly and lasts long, but you must be constantly
vigilant. Oddly enough, the very ubiquity of ants ensures an excellent
supply of their egg-coccoons; you can buy them fresh, dried or quick-
frozen or, for that matter, you can buy freshly killed ants themselves, a
favourite food of the larger thrush-like birds.
Apart from ants, you can buy other insects, there are dried " water-
boatmen ", and a beetle like a German cockroach--the Rice-husk Beetle,
which obligingly undergoes population explosions if you feed it rice-husks,
banana skins and a little rice-water, its habitat is quite odd since rice-husks
used to be used as an insecticide because of their abrasiveness. This
pachydermatous beetle, however, evolved with great cunning in a medium
which was lethal to its insect parasites and predators alike.
As for other bird-foods, there is a never-ending supply of bananas,
grapes and paw-paws, the latter, unless Ai in quality, being regarded as
pig-food. Bird-seeds of all kinds are available but you can rarely buy
millet sprays and I have to grow my own.
The Market
As I have already hinted, the Thai-market for individual bird species
but this is offset by an absence of import restrictions and a
is " thin
proximity to sources e.g. Japan, Hong Kong, and Indonesia.

Market conditions are however largely governed by the presence of the
Week-end Market " which sells everything from kettles to cobras, from
es to finches. Here dealers can set up stalls for nominal temporary rent
About 40 stalls cater for bird-keepers, some selling seed only, some
.cal birds only, some imported birds only and some a mixture. Pro-
inquity tends to level prices, and you can go from stall to stall bargaining,
at for rarer species bargaining is necessarily limited. There is no doubt,
jwever, that the establishment of the " Week-end Market " some years
;o has helped not only to cheapen but helped also to popularize the
;epmg of birds.

some claim to be autochthonous and thus not one of " the common herd '

Doves are the darlings of Thai bird-fanciers and those which coo th
most melodically fetch high prices--#100 for a single bird being th
highest recorded price. A mystique surrounds the bird--the excellent
of its dawn cooing setting a favourable augury for the day. At th
Week-end Market there are stalls selling doves exclusively and one car
see devotees just sitting and gazing for hours on end at either of the twc
races --tigrina or vacillans --of the Spotted-necked Dove which, to mos
foreigners, is just a mousy little bird, but here has an aura of magic am
majesty.
On the off-shore islands we also have the Nicobar Pigeon with its cape 0
long green hackles. A friend recently raised a brood in a very mixer
aviary. We have seven rather greenish parrots, including the two cut&amp;lt;
little Hanging Parrots.
There are some owls, occasionally marketed, and a range of colourfu
Trogons and Kingfishers. There is the highly-popular Hoopoe which
fortunately, is very common throughout Thailand. Thirteen Hornbill:
form a curiously interesting radiant group of which the Black and tht
ever-raucous Pied Hornbill are frequently on sale. There are also r-
species of Barbets including the extremely beautiful Coppersmith. A1

has them all and has taped all their calls. We have a large number 0
Woodpeckers, Wrynecks and Piculets, many of which have bright rec
crests and are otherwise coloured attractively. Some say they are almos'
impossible to keep for long, while the dealers claim that all one needs is ai
incessant supply of insect infested tree-limbs. Perhaps both statements
add up to the same thing!
A family of which I am very fond are the Pittas and I have spent a lot 0:
money building up a collection. I give them sloping logs on which tc
perch and mushy dead grass on which to hop about. They live on the anl
coccoons which are so easily obtainable here. The blue-winged Pitta is
quite cheap--about 10 shillings per pair but others of the nine species
bring around #4 or #5 per pair. Because of their low-roosting habits,
you must be constantly on the watch for ants.

There are innumerable Shrikes, Bulbuls, Tits, Thrushes, Orioles,
Starlings and Leaf-birds, representatives of all of which are frequently on
Two of the most interesting amongst this galaxy are the incredibly
fluent Grackle and that prince of songsters, the Shama. The Grackle
talking Mynah, or Greater Indian Hill Mynah, occurs over much of south-
eastern continental Asia and the sub-joined archipelago. I bought a
young one for #2 and imported a whole library of books of the " How to
tram your Grackle " type. " Koon Tong ", (" Mrs. Gold "), as we
1 hais call the bird, remained quite taciturn for several months and my
usband used to joke and say " No need to buy any food today; we can
have Koon Tong curry for tea ". And then within a fortnight, at the
onset of his first moult, Koon Tong developed an astonishingly varied
vocabulary, much of it conditioned, such as the tirade of abusive Thai
whenever the dogs bark unduly.
Rutgers ( loc. cit.) classes the Shama second only to the Nightingale as a
songster. You can buy Shama here for 12 shillings each (pre-vocal) and
up to 30 shillings for a guaranteed songster. Its close relative, the Magpie
Robin, used to come every day to teach our Shama to sing and it was
amusing to hear him warbling sotto voce to himself before he had the
confidence to sing his wonderfully liquid song with all its contrapuntal
improvizations.
Of the smaller-cage birds, there are three which particularly take my
ancy--the Advadavats, the White Eyes and the Pintail Nonpareils, the
last named is a beautifully svelte little bird in which the cock is most
colourful, many have rheumy noses but once you get a healthy pair they
grace an aviary for years.
Thailand has four White-eye species which are all too friendly, perching
on your shoulder as you walk out of the aviaries like prisoners planning a
bold escape. The Red Avadavats are the real pygmies of local bird-land,
forever building nests which, in my experience, come to nought.
There are lots of the 800 odd species of Thai birds which I have not
mentioned. Literature on them was highly scientific, fragmentary and
^argely unillustrated until a month or two ago when our own Dr. Boonsong
. e Thailand s outstanding Wild-Life Conservationist, published
ns ully illustrated Bird Guide of Thailand. Copies are, I understand,
ivaiJable from The Fauna Preservation Society, c/o Zoological Society

If you come to Bangkok, be sure to visit the Dusit Zoo, which has a very
me bird collection including a huge aviary, the central feature of which is a
irge swamp surrounded by a natural habitat of littoral plants.
A visit to Mrs. Y. Siak s Bangkok Reptile Grove " is also worthwhile,
ot only because it must be one of the best reptile collections in the world'
ut because it has some very fine specimens of carnivorous local birds and a
&apos;nge of ducks.

The Black-tailed Conure ( Pyrrhura melanura melanura ) has two sub-
species--Chapman's ( P . m. pacified) and Souance's ( P . m. souancei). In
the Natural History Museum there are skins of P. m. melanura and of
souancei ; unfortunately these skins are very old and undoubtedly
faded but it would appear that the main difference lies in the red feathers
on the edge of the wing. All the specimens marked melanura show a
little yellow in this area, whereas in souancei there is no trace of
yellow in these red feathers which extend further down the wing. The
scaly markings on the upper breast and neck on this sub-species are broadly
edged with huffish white, but in melanura the scaling is mostly brownish or
only faintly edged with buff.
I have a pair of Souance's Conures and they are quite handsomely
marked birds. In a consignment of about 20 of these conures which I
saw last year, I noticed that three were slightly different from the others
and bought them for this reason. They differ from P. m. souancei in the
following respects:

white.
The most obvious difference at first glance is the very striking white eye
ring, absent in the unidentified sub-species, which is a less brightly
coloured bird and slightly smaller than souancei. It shows no yellow in
the wing. Both sub-species have the upper side of the tail maroon and
the underside of the tail black; the flights are bluish-black and the rest of
the plumage is dark green.
Presumably, the unidentified sub-species must be Chapman's. Can
any member confirm this or refer me to any literature which may be
helpful?
I should add, that in all the Pyrrhura conures, there is no difference in
the plumage of cock and hen or adult and immature birds.

By C. J. O. Harrison (Perivale, Middlesex, England)
1 was recently congratulating myself on having persuaded two Robins
Enthacus rubecula , to tolerate each other and to nest, when I rose one
morning to find the eight-day-old young lay dead and cold outside the
nest, in a condition suggesting a violent end. I contacted an acquaintance
for sympathy, only to be told that he lost young Redstarts, Phoenicurus
phoenicurus , in the same way at about the same age. Looking back
through earlier volumes of the Avicultural Magazine I discovered that
this seemed to have happened, at roughly the same period in the nesting
cycle, with a number of attempted breedings of insect-eating species; and
in discussing the matter wuth others I discovered that I had joined a band
o. hopeful breeders of insectivorous birds for whom disaster strikes at
just such a time. It therefore seemed an appropriate moment to consider
the possible causes of these events.
Steinbacher and Wolters (1964) when discussing failures to rear young
Bearded Reedlings, Panurus biarmicus, in aviaries have suggested that
where parents usually spend most of the daylight hours carrying loads
ot small insects to begging young ones, the ready supply of food in the
aviary causes the young to become sated and sleepy long before the parent's
feeding impulses have been satisfied, and that when the young fail to
respond to offers of food the adults react as they would to dead young in
the nest, and throw them out. While this seems a reasonable hypothesis
it would operate at any age and, assuming the food supply was available,
the young would probably be ejected at an early stage and not halfwav
through their period in the nest.
The most likely cause of the death of the young would seem to be
aggressiveness of the male. Nicolai, while studying the Shama, Copsychus
malabancus , concluded that under aviary conditions the aggressive
dominance of the male reasserted itself during the nesting period when the
female was normally dominant and led to the killing of the young and
disruption of nesting. It is, however, difficult to believe that this is just
the normal aggressiveness of the male, usually inhibited by the female; and
it seems probable that there is an increase in aggressiveness under aviary
conditions possibly through a damming-up of aggressive behaviour that
would find relief under natural conditions. Normally a great deal of the
11a e s energy must be dissipated, while the female is incubating and caring
or small young, in patrolling the territory, fighting off rivals, and in
\0x25A0rigorous assaults on a variety of small prey. Under aviary conditions
e territory is very restricted, the rivals are usually absent, the food is
nactive and readily accessible, and the only other living things present,
owards which the male can react, may be the female and the young.'

130 C. J. O. HARRISON--KILLING OF NESTLINGS BY THE MALE PARENT
This could create the potentially dangerous situation where the male might
suddenly attack his mate or offspring.
Where, as sometimes happens, the male destroys the young as soon as
they emerge from the egg, it seems unlikely that he resents them as
intruders, and I question whether he recognises them as birds. It seems
more probable that the small squirming lumps of bare flesh release his
impulse to kill small organisms. The larger insect-eating birds will at
times take small fish, amphibians, and reptiles, and the sight of the young
might release such a tendency which could be all the stronger for having
had no other outlet. This might account for the killing of the young in
the early stages, but it would not explain why the male might feed small
young and then kill them when half grown.
A suggestion often put forward by aviculturists is that the male destroys
the young in order to " persuade the female to go to nest again
While it is understandable that the male might be reacting strongly to the
absence of any sexual response from the female, I think it argues a degree
of reasoning that does not appear to be present in birds to suggest that
the male recognises a nest of young as a distraction that is competing with
him for the female's attention and decides to get rid of it. It would appear
to be a direct extrapolation from probable (if a little uncivilized) human
behaviour in similar circumstances to that of birds. I think that if
aggression was aroused in the male by a lack of response in the female it
would be likely to result in a direct attack on her, and to expect the bird
to achieve its end by indirect methods would seem to be asking rather
too much of it.
I would add that I am equally dubious of that old and apparently
widely accepted statement that in most species the male " drives the
female to nest ". It again argues a degree of reasoning the existence of
which I doubt. Such " driving to nest as I have seen appeared to be
simply direct aggression on the part of the male, and if the female does
finally take refuge on or at the nest, and if the male is inhibited from
attacking his mate at the nest and therefore leaves her alone, this would
appear to be a fortunate accident rather than the original intention. It
is certainly an aspect of the behaviour of birds in aviaries which deserves
more critical examination by students of bird behaviour. The nest
may not necessarily save the female from violence since I know of one
instance of a female Nuthatch, Sitta europaea , killed on her eggs by the
male in an aviary.
Assuming that there is a build-up of aggressive behaviour and hunting
tendencies for which there is no natural outlet in the males of insectivorous
birds in aviaries during the breeding season, one can therefore suggest
reasons for the attacks on the hen and the killing of small young, but this
does not explain the sudden killing of young birds, which the male has
been helping to feed, at a point about halfway through their period in the
nest. Unless one assumes that this is the length of time needed for the

&amp;gt;ales frustrations to build up to a point of release, it is necessary to con-
der what else might be critical at this stage.
One thing apparent to me when observing the nestlings was that at about
us period in growth a change seemed to occur, and what had previously
een a blind, reptilian object with a constantly gaping mouth now began
&amp;gt; appear for the first time as a bird which, although lacking proper
iumage, started to resemble in size, shape and general appearance the
,ec,es to which it belonged. If such a change was apparent to me it is
jssible that it might be equally apparent to the male parent and I think
le could reasonably propose a hypothesis that at this stage in the develon-
ent of the young the male may for the first time recognise them as
dividuals of the same species rather than as a generalized mass of small
ijects begging for food ,n a nest. If this were so, and if the male was
&apos; reason of the aviary environment, in a state of hyper-aggression, then
&apos;ack eC * S 10n m &apos; ght be the faet0r whkh tri SS ered off the final fatal
K. E. L Simmons has suggested to me that if the species involved are
ose in which the male usually feeds the female this could give him an
ernative outlet for any feeding tendencies which were present and which
ight otherwise conflict with, and perhaps inhibit, his attack on the young
A recognition of probable causes does not ensure the discovery of a

brood. On the days on which the feathers broke from the sheaths on th
backs and necks of the young, the old birds stood on the edge of the nes
often with food in their bills, screaming the enemy call, and while doin
so they often made inhibited attacking movements towards the young one:
Both parents of pair 3 behaved in this manner when I put among thei
naked young a slightly older young one which was already a little featherec

visited for the first time the Bird House to be found there in a park an
which is run by the local Cage Bird Society. In size, of course, it cannc
be compared with the Bird Houses found on the Continent or the Britis
Isles, but it was not so very small anyhow. The collection of birds, how
ever, surprised me. We had expected to find only the most comma
finches and parrots, but instead we found a good collection of notabl
insectivorous and fruit-feeding birds, many of which certainly not are to b

Just north of Norrkoping, what is believed to be the second biggest
limal park in Europe (I guess Whipsnade Zoo Park is the biggest) is
tuated. It is called Kolmarden Zoo Park and is quite new, far from fully
ocked yet. However, very few birds were kept, and we only saw some
[acaws (one Hyacinthine) and Cockatoos, but the enclosures for the
^ers and polar bears were exceptionally spacious and good.
Interesting new birds which have been brought into Sweden during
&amp;gt;68 and early 1969 includes King Parrakeets; Yellow-fronted New Zeal-
id Parrakeets; the little Malayan Blue-rumped Parrot; Emma's Conure
vrrhura leucotis emma (we believe--three pairs, all of which were bred
it year in Denmark in one nest; the full nest consisted of nine young, and
e breeder was Mr. Carl Wentrup of Lyngby); Red Hooded Siskins;

olden-fronted Parrakeet Psilopsiagon a. aurifrons a species which
ifortunately seems to be very difficult to keep alive. I know of only one

These are some informal notes on my observations of birds in Japanese
oological Gardens during a period of leave in early February 1969.
Ueno has a very good bird collection; however, housing remains quite
rimitive as compared to our modern western zoos. Few except the really
opical African and South American forms are in heated houses, most
avmg access to shelter but being kept outdoors, including the Hornbills.
here are two female Concave-casqued Hornbills in Ueno (they did not
low the difference in sexes), and a trio of Pied Hornbill.
The collections of cranes and pheasants is quite good, with many rare

Located some 15 miles or so out of the centre of Tokyo, but still in tl
metropolitan limits is a new zoo called Tama Zoological Park. It is no
11 years old, and is now independent of Ueno. There are a number
exhibits which follow geographic lines as much as possible. The birds fj
the most part are kept in a series of cages which blend in with the trees ar
shrubs which dot the hills of the zoo. For the Birds of Prey there are tv
huge aviaries, in one are several Hooded Vultures ( Aegypius ), White-tail*
Sea Eagle (Raliaeetus albicilla) that were busy nest building on the day
my visit, hawks and kites. In the adjoining cage, which is also quite lar
are two adult Stellar Sea Eagles.
Scattered about the grounds are flights for Snowy Owls, Clark's Eag
Owl, Formosan Blue Magpies, various pheasants, and one walk-throu^
cage with exotic waterfowl and shorebirds. The zoo is now building, ai
will open this spring, a series of attractive runs for the wild Jungle-fowl
the world, and already have for this exhibit trios of Gallus lafayetti (ti
only ones in Japan) and Gallus soneratti. Off exhibit and for breeding a
extensive runs of rare gallinaceous birds. The cock Satyr Tragopan w
particularly fine. There are several cranes here including pairs of Ma
churian, White-necked and Hooded.
Osaka is a rather newer zoo, and in view of Expo. 70 is rapidly tearii
down its old structures and replacing them with most attractive n(
exhibits. There are many birds of prey here, including a large series
those species native to Japan. There are fine runs for cranes, and t
Sarus has hatched several young here in recent years, I saw the late:
hatched in October 1968. The zoo also has set aside a very large avia
solely for the use of European Storks. Some sixteen young have be
hatched here in the past five years, now in the second generation. This
a very good exhibit and since the cage is quite high they can fly about free
I noted in my brief walk about this zoo a group of very reddish Scar
Ibis, several young Cassowary and Ostriches, two groups of Argus Pheasai
a pair of Concave-casqued Hornbill, Toco and Green-billed Touca
several Hooded Cranes, a true pair of Indian Black-necked Storks, and ti
rather rare psittacines which were not known to the zoo authorities
found that really rare things were frequently misidentified or not identifi
at all in several zoos), in a house, living in small cages. One was a fi
Thick-billed Parrot, and the other a Racquet-tailed Parrot (Pnonitun
with a very bright blue head, and perfectly formed tail racquets, rht
also were several Rose-crested Cockatoos.
Nagoya for many years was the largest collection in Japan and sti
some very top quality stock. The zoo is large in size and borders
botanical gardens. The Chilean Flamingo were in fine colour, and the
were two Coscoroba Swans, a rarely seen species in Japan. I thought t
pairs of Andean Condor and Hooded Vultures quite handsome,
were four Hooded Cranes, two European, and single Manchurian a
Stanleys. In the tropical bird house I noted four Citron-crested Cockatc

A rarity in Japan is the free zoo, and one of the most well known is
ogevama Zoo in Yokohama, a short walk from the central railway station,
id found in the midst of a well ordered park surrounded by the houses of
is vast port city. The grounds are of necessity very small, but the
limals and birds were in good condition. Mandarin Ducks do very well
\0x25A0re and young are hatched each year, I thought all of the 16 seen were in

erring Gulls and Japanese Kittiwakes, two colourful Rose Pelicans
elecanus roseus), Woolly-necked Stork, a colony of Night Herons
lycticorax) that have young every year, several Moluccan Ibis, four
iropean Spoonbills, and a small pheasant exhibit which had wild imported
ikados, very fine looking birds. The pheasants in general in Yokohama
\0x25A0re better than anywhere else save Tama and Ueno. Of course the
ize exhibit is a rather good sized flight cage containing four male and
*ee female Andean Condors, the largest group on exhibit outside South
nerica, and more are to be added this summer. One pair from this
lection is on loan to the zoo at Seoul, Korea. All were in magnificent
idition, but to date there has been no breeding, probably since the cage
wercrowded, even though quite large.

\BNORMAL COLOURING IN SOME PARROTS
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.948808666666667" page_id="58089540"  page_num="137" year="" vol="">
By Rosemary Low (Sidcup, Kent, England)
he study of abnormal colouring in parrots and parrotlike birds is
remely interesting, examples of which are not particularly rare. Colour
iations can be divided into two classes: (") those caused by mutation
{b) those caused by constitutional disturbance or dietary deficiencv
old age.
I any British bird fanciers know that hand-reared birds which are
ering from a deficiency in their diet often show partially or completely
te feathers in their plumage; this is particularly evident on birds with
k or brown plumage, where it is due to a lack of melanin pigment when
feathers are growing. Green feathers usually possess a combination
nelanin and a yellow pigment; if the melanin is lost the other may
ain to produce a yellow feather. The yellow feathers of Amazon
ots are of this type; but Grey Parrots are exceptional in that the feather
&apos; be pink or red if the grey colour is lost.

I have had two cases of yellow feathering among my own birds. Tw(
years ago I purchased a female Salvin's Amazon--on the day she arriver
in this country. There was quite a lot of yellow scattered irregularly ove
her plumage, but mainly on the back and flights. The feathers affectec
were partially, not wholly, yellow. She gradually lost all these yellov
feathers.
She appeared quite healthy but later contracted sinus trouble which ha
left her with a permanent, though not serious, wheeze. This woulc
indicate a constitutional weakness.
The second case relates to a male Purple-bellied Parrot ( Triclaru
malachitacea). This bird, when imported about four years ago by Mr. H
Murray of Brentwood, was perfectly normal in colour. Golden-yellov
feathers gradually appeared in his plumage, which have really adde&amp;lt;
considerably to his beauty. Some of the flight feathers are marked witl
yellow and the lower tail feathers are all almost completely yellow. /
large number of feathers on the back and rump and a few on the breast am
wings are also yellow.
This bird appears very fit and wintered outside with only an open
fronted shelter. The pair have apparently always refused fruit and greei
food, unlike Mr. Murray's other pair of Purple-bellieds, and feed only 01
seed and nectar and any winged insects that they can hawk for themselves
I can only persuade them to take sunflower seed, a little hemp, a dail
handful of peanuts in the shell, spray millet and nectar consisting of hone
and rose-hip syrup. They also like twigs from fruit trees with buds oi
them. The cause of the yellow feathering in this bird is therefore almos
certainly a deficient diet.
Frank Finn, in his book Pets and How to Keep Them wrote of a so-calle*
" King Grey Parrot ", i.e. one with irregular red feathering on the bod\
He stated that " The best specimen of the variety I ever saw, a bird whicl
was really more red than grey, showed the plumage of a thin and sickl
character, and I have heard since that it moulted out much greyer, thu
showing the red to have been a sign of constitutional disturbance ".
Another interesting case of the appearance of yellow feathers can be seei
in the Double-eyed Dwarf or Fig Parrot ( Opopsitta diophthalm&amp;lt;
diophthalma) in the Bird House at the London Zoo. This bird wa
collected by David Attenborough in New Guinea in 1957. Twelve year
in confinement is a remarkable length of time for a species which few hav
even succeeded in keeping alive. For the last two years this little bird ha
been showing definite signs of age and spends most of the day sleeping
During the last twelve months, it has acquired a large number of yello\
feathers and now all its plumage is evenly mottled with yellow.
I recently saw a Spectacled Amazon Parrot ( Amazona albifrons albifrons
known to be very old, marked in exactly the same way.

This lovely little Macaw, the smallest and perhaps the rarest of the
ue Macaws, is a native of Eastern Brazil, chiefly in the Province of
lhia. It owes its name to Dr. J. B. Spix who discovered it on the Rio
in Francisco, Bahia, during his trip to Brazil, 1817-1820. Rare, not
il} in Museums but also in zoological collections, there are no authentic
cords that show its importation into America prior to 1927 and very few,
am, since that date. Of the very few imported in the United States, I
ceived one from the firm of Louis Ruhe, Inc. of New York, in exchange
r a Thick-billed Parrot, equally rare at that time.
A dwarf compared to the giant Hyacinthine Macaw, it is but twenty-two
dies in total length. It differs noticeably also in the paler and softer
ade of cobalt blue, according to the light or the position it assumes,
ost of the feathers being edged with light grey the plumage has a silvery
ect which is very pleasing. The feathers of the head and neck are
eyish and elongated and often erected which gives the head a puffy
pearance. The upper part of the chest is tinged with brownish-grey
d the under parts are dull greenish-blue. Its comparatively small beak,
lg tail, and general elegance of form make it one of the most perfectly
portioned in this family of usually ungainly birds.
Talking parrots have been rare in my collection but " Mac " our Spix
icaw, while not as proficient as a good talking Amazon Parrot, has quite
ew sentences. When any attention is paid to him, particularly by a
anger who takes his fancy, the conversation carried on gives an impres-
n of a very intelligent and educated bird. All people do not make good
pressions evidently for unless he senses a sympathetic nature he sits
smn and dumb on his perch. He is not kept in a cage but his stand has a
ee foot high natural branch on which he gyrates and flaps his wings with
at abandon. Having one wing clipped soon taught him not to attempt
ring his territory and we could trust him not to, voluntarily,
dis period of greatest loquacity is in the morning before breakfast when
can hear him chattering " Mac wants his breakfast " Mac wants
ie water "--or apple--or bread--or " Mac wants a drink " usually in
id succession and quite distinctly, in a feminine voice. WTien we
ue down he says " Good-morning " quite briskly.
) stranger is apt to be disconcerted when suddenly asked " Want a
A " by this feathered imp. We have taught him " Way down on the
anee River far, far away " which he sings in a funny quaver, and
ock abye baby, in the tree top ", gulping and swallowing a word
asionally and, I am sorry to say, missing the tune completely. He is

quite lovable and tame, rarely nips, and though he does squawk sometim
this does not compare in volume to the harsh, strident screech of tl
larger Macaws or Cockatoos.
Sometimes after indulging in his wild twirlings on his perch he w
become quite noisy for a spell, then suddenly say " What's the matte
huh? " and if reproved for anything says quietly " Mac's a bad boy
He is always ready to have his head rubbed, purring the while and is qui
amusing when he whispers the sentences he knows. His monkey-lil
antics are quite amusing when he is climbing up and down his branch ar
he derives much amusement from a small bell which dangles from a cha
fastened to the branch.
For food my Macaw had a great preference for sunflower seed thou#
canary, millet and hemp seed were offered and included in the set
mixture. In addition, each morning he would get the core of an app
and a piece of drv bread or cracker which invariably he would drop in tl
water before eating. In summer a bit of grass sod would be enjoye
He liked a bath in the warm summer rain, drooping his wings and fluffir
out, but during the winter he tolerated a bath in the tub with about tw
inches of water and would be gently sprayed with a small sprinkler. I
this time his feathers would be held tight and close to his body.
" Mac " was received 9th February 1928. I can still visualize hii
crawling out of the shipping crate and shyly climbing on my hand, h
was a young bird and met an untimely end. I had been out of town at
convention and " Mac " was being temporarily boarded at the Zoo. h
had been placed with two Amazons supposedly safe but one morning tl
parrot keeper found him dead from attacks by the Amazons. His li
ended on nth March 1946.

fennerman The Birds of Tropical West Africa , Oliver and Boyd, London
949; vol. 7, p. 239.
On 21 st July, 1967, an albino of this species was hatched in my aviary
lere m Long Beach, California. It was noted on the morning of hatching
s its skin was a uniform pink in marked contrast to the dusky skins of its
:estmates. The bird was observed daily during the nestling stage, photo-
graphed from time to time, and conditioned to hand feeding as a part of
ne observational procedure. The lining of the mouth was pink with no
race of the black band across the palate. The eyes, which opened on the
eventh day, were red. The juvenile plumage was white, with a faint
nge of pink on the upper tail coverts and the upper surface of the retrices
Although the normally coloured siblings of this bird departed from the
est on the 17th day, the albino stayed in the nest box for two additional
ays. After departure, it demonstrated a visual difficulty in bright
miight, being unable to fly to the perches with the precision usually
emonstrated by fledglings of this species. For its protection, it was
moved to an indoor cage with one of its parents.
At the postjuvenal moult in October, the pinfeathers of the rump region
ere an intense pink and the resulting feathers formed an attractive rose
floured spot. The amount of this colour has varied with succeeding
oults in a manner which suggests it is influenced by diet. Presumably, it
due to a carotenoid pigment which is genetically independent of, and
?mally masked by, the melanin pigments in birds of standard colour,
he tarsi, feet, and eyelids of the albino are flesh coloured.
The albino, a male, did not breed during its second summer. It was
\0x25A0nfined during that summer in an outdoor aviary with several prospective
ates. During the winter of 1968-69 it was kept in an indoor cage with

By A. A. Prestwich (Edenbridge, Kent, England)
Thirty years ago I spent six months in Orkney--the Magnetic North
During that time I collected the names of birds, both dialect and ir
literature.
There are between 65 and 70 islands in the group--a couple with thriving
townships, some sparsely populated, but well over half uninhabited--with
a population of about 25,000. Some of the more elderly Orcadians
probably with justification, boast of viking ancestry and undoubtedly mam
of the names used for birds are of Scandinavian origin.
During the war many thousands of servicemen were stationed through-
out the Islands, and since then Orkney has become a centre of tourism. A
number of the bird names listed had long fallen into disuse and it is ven
probable that the great influx of visitors of all kinds has now rendered the
great majoritv of the remainder obsolete. Most will have been replacec
bv those generally accepted in current check-lists and handbooks, and so
apart from being of interest only to the philologist, they will soon be
forgotten.
Some of the names are common to Shetland or the north of Scotland, 01
all three. The list does not pretend to be complete but it is believed tc
include all but the most obscure.

The most welcome additions were three species of Manakins--the
Blue-backed, Red-headed, and White-bearded. We had been trying for
a long time to acquire specimens of the latter two species, and it is such a
pity that they are not better travellers, as they enhance any collection of
birds. Also received were a pair of Black-gorgetted Thrushes, three
Roulrouls, a Ross' Touraco, several Ferruginous Wood Partridges, Lesser
and Rufous-bellied Niltavas, Klaas Cuckoo, Rufous Chatterers, Streaked
Spiderhunter and Yellow-crowned and Red-headed Bulbuls.
Two more clutches of Green Wood-hoopoes have been reared and the
hen is sitting again. A pair retained from their first clutch last year are
also beginning to show an interest in the nest-box. The Red-billed Horn-
bills are also nesting again after a lapse of almost twelve months, and a pair
of Spotted Morning Warblers purchased only in January have built small
cup-shaped mud nests in several places, directly onto thick boughs. On
three occasions they laid eggs and commenced incubation, only to desert
them after a few days. The Hoopoes were again thwarted in their nesting
attempts when the hen suffered a blocked preen gland whilst incubating.
The expelled contents had the most vile smell. The problems of breeding
birds in communal aviaries are still with us, and both the Andaman
Grackles and Yellow-breasted Fruit Pigeons have recently lost chicks that
were several days old. Abyssinian Ground Thrushes are also sitting

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983738285714286" page_id="58089548"  page_num="145" year="" vol="">
By A. A. Prestwich (Edenbridge, Kent, England)
There appears to be a deal of confusion regarding the English names of
ome of the Eclectus Parrots that have been bred in this country.
In 1912, Miss M. Drummond, Errol, Scotland, bred two Eclectus
'arrots. In two Editorial notes in " Bird Notes " Wesley T. Page
eferred to them as Red Sided Eclectus Parrots and Grand Eclectus
parrots. In her breeding account Miss Drummond called them Red-
ided Eclectus pectoralis and the Foreign Bird Club Medal was awarded
nder that name. But when another young one was reared the following
ear the Editor referred to it as the Grand Eclectus Eclectus roratus and
diss Drummond too, called it the Grand. The situation was eventually
larified by an errata slip which states that by an unfortunate misunder-
tanding the birds referred to as " Red-sided Eclectus (E. pectoralis) "
/ere in fact Grand ( E. roratus). Miss Drummond gave another breeding
ccount in the Avicultural Magazine, using the name Grand Eclectus
oratus , and the Society's Medal was awarded for this success.
Mrs. E. H. Hartley, Hastings, reported the rearing of a Grand Eclectus
iratus in 1913.
The next succesful breeder was H. J. Indge, in 1952 . He describes
is birds as Red-sided Lorius roratus pectoralis and the Society's Medal
as awarded accordingly.
The most recent success is that of Mrs. N. Howard in 1968. The
lbspecies bred she names as the Ceram Eclectus Lorius roratus roratus.
Now the question is who has bred which species or subspecies?
Authorities are agreed that there is only one species of the genus Lorius
oddaert, 1783 (replaces Eclectus Wagler, 1832), namely roratus Muller,
776.
Peters, with slight reservations, recognizes eleven subspecies or geo-

maforensis , Mafor or Numfor Eclectus Parrot.
biaki , Biak Eclectus Parrot.
aruensis , Aru Eclectus Parrot.
macgillwrayi, Pascoe River Eclectus Parrot.
goodsoni, Goodson's Eclectus Parrot.
solomonensis , Solomon Islands Eclectus Parrot.
Possibly there are now others.
There is, of course, no gainsaying that Miss Drummond bred an
Eclectus Parrot. But in view of the duplication of names by Wesley Page
and Miss Drummond herself, and a complete absence of any description
it is impossible to say exactly which Eclectus Parrot she did breed. It is,
however, accepted that it was the Grand.
Mrs. Hartley's bald report: " One Grand Eclectus ( Eclectus roratus)--
only the second time reared in captivity I believe ", could mean much or
little.
That the Eclectus Parrot bred by Indge was the Red-sided pectoralis is
quite certain, as he showed the parents with their young one at the B.A.C.
Meeting, 14th January, 1953.
Mrs. Howard calls her Eclectus Parrots the Ceram Lorius roratus roratus ,
which is properly the Grand. As this Eclectus Parrot does indeed come
from Ceram amongst other islands it could quite reasonably be given this
as an alternative name. But Mrs. Howard has imported some twenty to
twenty-five pairs of Eclectus Parrots and never before or since has she
received a pair like her " Ceram "--all have been either Grand or Red-
sided. Without being certain of their origin it is very difficult to decide to
which race they belong. Colin Harrison has kindly compared colour
photographs with the skins in the Natural History Museum. He is unable
to come to any definite conclusion but thinks they might possibly be
aruensis , from the Aru Islands. In any case they are sufficiently distinct
for the Council to regard this event as a first success and to award the
Society's Medal.
Besides the Red-sided and Grand, Westerman's, Riedel's and Cornelia's
Eclectus Parrots are believed to have been imported; and a smaller, purer
and darker green race used to arrive from time to time. It was recognized
as the Ceram or Cardinal Eclectus cardinalis , but cardinalis is now con-
sidered to be a synonym of L. r. roratus. And so?
It is believed that another aviculturist has bred Eclectus Parrots during
the past two or three years, but no such success has been reported to the
Society by the breeder. Only birds bred by Members of the Society have
been reviewed.

The Whooping Cranes at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, in
Maryland, continue to increase. Ten have now been reared from eggs
taken from the nests of the wild flock. Three of the five young hatched
in 1967 were successfully reared, also seven of the ten hatched last year.
The Cranes lay two eggs, but usually rear only one chick. The United
States and Canadian biologists take only one egg from a nest.

Pheasants in two localities, in the Auckland Province, north of Auckland;
Silver Pheasants in two of our State forests, and Lady Amherst's Pheasants
in the Coromandel Peninsular. The Goldens seem to have established in
the areas of liberation and I have had confirmed sightings of them with suc-
cessful rearings of young. Permission to release had to be obtained from
the Internal Affairs Dept.; the pheasants become Crown property and are

Scotland , breeding in the penguin colony in the Edinburgh Zoo was
disappointing. " Nineteen Gentoo chicks were hatched, but ten died al
a very early age and seven were eventually reared. The post-mortem or
the chicks indicated a stress factor which could have been caused by the
extremely high temperatures experienced during June when readings oi
90* F were recorded in the enclosure over a period of two weeks. Onl)
one King chick was hatched, other three being found dead in their shells

IUSTRALIAN PARAKEETS. By K. Immelmann, A.O.B.; Belgium.
Pricey. (Translated by R. Wilson from the 2nd Revised Edition
in Die Neue Brehm-Bucheri ".)
The Association Ormthologique de Belgique have very enterprisingly
prepared this paperback English translation of Dr. Immelmann's book.
3 r Immelmann has studied parrots in Australia and is familiar with the
nodern literature on the birds of that continent. He has produced this
ery useful book incorporating the latest information on the subject.
The book deals with the Grass Parakeets and Broad-tailed Parakeets
ad also includes the Polytelis species and the Cockatiel, omitting the King
nd Crimson-wings, and the Cockatoos, and nectar-feeders with the
xception of the Swift Parakeet. It opens with a general discussion of the
.ustrahan parakeets in their natural habitat, and on keeping them in
varies in Europe.
The greater part of the book is taken up with a systematic description
)ecies by species. This begins, for each, with a general statement of the
imes and distribution, and maps of distribution are included. Where
Jpropriate the species is subdivided into the various subspecies, and
milar details are given for each, together with a note on the distinctive
atures of the subspecies. This highlights one of the failings of the book,
here are no descriptions of the appearance of the birds. Each species
illustrated by an excellent monochrome sketch by H. Heinzel, but these
nnot indicate the colour. There are also ten colour plates showing
wen of the twenty-nine species, but the six by R. A. Vowles are of very
nable standard. The book might therefore be of limited use to anyone
thout other sources of description or coloured illustration. Apart
&amp;gt;m this one defect the work is very good, the text giving good up-to-date
.ormation on what is known of the life and habits of the birds, specific
[cultural information being summarized at the end of the section on
: species. There is a useful bibliography at the end of the book, and a
:tion earlier on of monochrome photographs of typical habitats, and of
Tie or the species in aviaries.
This is a work to be warmly recommended for any aviculturist interested

The author is well known for his observations, over forty years, of
hand-reared birds, often at partial liberty, at his home near Toronto,
Canada. Now 89, he has recently written this account of some of his
observations on the birds that he has kept.
One is aware throughout the book of the deep affection that the author
obviously feels for his birds. He is anxious at all times to emphasize the
individuality and personal peculiarities of each bird as a separate being,
varying to some degree in its behaviour and activities from others of the
same species. It is obvious that he has been engaged in a prolonged battle
with those who insist on a more mechanistic interpretation of a bird's life
and behaviour, and who have regarded the individual bird as an automaton
which, in response to a certain stimulus, would invariably provide the
expected response. To some extent this has driven the author to the
opposite extreme, and although he advances his defence of anthropo-
morphism (which has some justification, despite its use as a term of abuse)
it nevertheless makes it difficult to evaluate the claims and comments on
such difficult subjects as intelligence and the ability to learn and remember.
Although one wishes at times for a little more critical appraisal and factual
detail, the book does show the extent to which the hand-rearing of birds
and constant living with known individuals can lead to a greater apprecia-
tion and understanding of their lives and behaviour.
Those of us in Britain who have had similar experience in raising birds
tend to take our good fortune for granted, and it is therefore a little
saddening to discover that Roy Ivor's opportunity to keep and study
these birds was a wholly exceptional one maintained by virtue of special
permits. The story that he quotes of the tame nestling Bluebird, left
behind by its parents and hand-reared, which was to be confiscated and
released elsewhere because those who failed to leave it to die had broken
the law by being in possession of it, underlines the need for saner legisla-
tion, flexible enough to cope with such exceptions.
Criticism apart, Ivor's book does show the enhanced and sympathetic
understanding that can be gained by a closer association with birds
through keeping them, which I believe to be one of the great justifications
for the continued existence of aviculture; and I would recommend it to
every aviculturist who cares for birds as individuals. The book is illus-
trated with many photographs of Ivor's own birds, 63 in the text and four
pages of colour photographs.

ig into the zoo and then roosting in the trees. All branches in a certain
1 were literally covered with the birds which huddled together in order to protect
.selves from the extreme cold winds. So many of them were sitting on the
iches that these broke off and by this severe damage was caused to our trees,
liters, especially yew-trees and also ivy were their favourite resting places under
ch the layer of guano became thicker every day. Every morning, our keepers
icted dead birds there in bucketsful, most of the starlings were completely
iched and obviously starved. We tried to feed the mass in our zoo but as they
it always early in the morning and came back only before sunset this help was
very successful. We had been unable to count the number of starlings we
)ose however that they must have been at least 10,000. They all were stopped
erlin by a continuous zone of high pressure in their breeding areas in Northern
Eastern Europe.

SOME BIRDS AT LILFORD

f-W- B : Frostick has recently presented me with a journal in manuscript by
1 Lflford, titled Collection of Living Animals." This folio volume lists all
)irds and ammals kept at Lilford during the period August, 1878--June, 1893.
ie Eiltord aviaries were, of course, renowned for the birds of prey. Amongst
oany hundreds of entries probably the most interesting are those relating to the
e-tailed Eagle Aquila albicilla --formerly resident in the British Isles and now
a rare migrant: and the Little Owl Athene noctua --now resident as an intro-
a bird. There were three examples of the former at Lilford in 1878. Two

were " Taken from nest in Coomeragh mountains, Co. Waterford, and sent to n
by one of Lord Bessborough's game-keepers who assisted at harrying the nest

Very savage." The sex of the other is not stated. The third example w
" Caught by a labourer in January, 1875, at Spring Wood, near Biggin, Oundle
Lord Lilford notes: " I think this bird was a nestling of the year. Donald Mack;
had a shot at it a day or two before its capture as it flew over Lilford Wood,
had a leg broken in the capture, and had I think a shot in or near the brain as it
occasionally affected by a curious convulsive movement of the head, but it fee&amp;lt;
well and seems healthy--Now in full moult, Aug. ' 78 It died the followir
year.
Towards the end of the last century Mr. E. G. B. Meade-Waldo, in Kent, ar
Lord Lilford attempted to introduce the Little Owl. The efforts of the form
met with some success but it was due mainly to the perseverance of Lord Lilfoi
that this Owl became established and subsequently spread with considerab
rapidity throughout the greater part of England.
In August, 1878, there were eight Little Owls in the Lilford Collection, obtain*
in 1876-7-8, and other singles and pairs were added in later years. There
nothing to connect any of these with the various releases.
The first relevant entry is dated 27th June, 1887, and says 24 birds were obtaine
Subsequent entries show that between 1887 and 1893 no less than 238 birds we
liberated, " Distributed in neighbouring belfries, Terrace, etc." All these bin
were obtained from Castang, and their country of origin is given as Holland &amp;gt;
the Netherlands.
There were three Eagle-Owls Bubo maximus, a male and two females, in tl
collection in 1878. Lord Lilford says of a Norwegian bird: " This bird is at lea
30 years old. Has laid many eggs and hatched some young here." There
no further entry concerning this species until April, 1881, when the additions ii
elude two " Bred in Lilford aviary." There is no mention of the parentage nor 1
later success. A. A. Prestwich.

wNch like the celebrated paste nectar, is guaranteed to contain the full vitamin context
providing the nutritional constituents needed to maintain all nectarines in vigorous health
Hitherto it has been impossible to compile a dry food in which could be contained the
necessary Vitamins A &amp; D, which are normally not water soluble. In the paste form these
essential ingredients were included by addition of "Stimulite" 'VITOL&apos; which was entirely
water soluble We now include in the powder a similar product, a development by the
world-famed Glaxo Company which alone makes this possible. This firm has produced
tiny granules which contain the fantastic amount of 325,000 International Food Units-
i.u. per gram of Vitamin A and 81,250 International Food Units-i.u. per gram of Vita-
min D3. This, like the Vitol, is completely water soluble.

T &apos; &apos; &apos; B2 (kPOWn QS the anim *l- P rotein factor), B12, the full context contains

This sensational development also contains HI-PROTEIN-PLUS which you will see is itself
o water-soluble food containing 85% animal protein. Protein is life itself; without it
there would be no living creatures at all. It is essential for the maintenance of body
tissues and bones which have to be constantly reinforced, this is done by metabolism--
i.e., the conversion of protein by amino acids. There are twenty-two amino acids, some
of which are manufactured within the body; there are ten, however, that cannot be so
produced these are called ESSENTIAL Amino-Acids. They are as follows:- Arginine,
Histidine, Lysme Trypotophone, Phenylalanine, Valine, Methionine, Leucine, Isoleucine
and Thremne The combination of all these essentials in the Nectar Granules ensures
complete nutrition to all species of nectarines.

{Aplonis panayensis)
By Robin L. Restall (Copenhagen, Denmark)
In the first volume of Aviculture (1925), M. Delacour had this to say
of the subject of this paper: " . . . The Aplonis are a little smaller than
Starlings; males are generally glossy black, females less dark; the differ-
ent species are found in numerous islands, and are of little interest to avi-
culture and seldom introduced. "
Mr. Allen Silver, on the other hand, began an article on Glossy Star-
hngs (1955) with " one cannot really think of Glossy Starlings without
remembering Calornis {Aplonis) ". Admittedly, 80% of Mr. Silver's art-
icle dealt with African Starlings, but it is nice to find a not unfavourable
mention of them. The references to these birds in avicultural literature
are rare, but a serious searcher can find mention elsewhere.
My introduction to the species was when I discovered Robinson's Birds
of the Malay Peninsula many years ago. Although I did not read the text
on Aplonis panayensis , or even the caption to the picture, the illustration
struck firmly in my mind. Later, when I became interested in the African
Amethyst Starling, Cinnyricinclus leucogaster , the plumage of the thrush-
like female Amethyst recalled the picture of the Aplonis in Robinson. I
resolved that when the opportunity arose I would obtain the latter.
The ambition became reality when, in September 1967, I saw an ad-
vertisement by Avon Aviaries at Evesham for some Thailand Green Star-
lings. Without waiting for an opportunity to refer to Robinson, I tele-
phoned the proprietor, Mr. Burton, and ascertained that the males were
green and the females thrush-like, and that both had the distinctive red
eye I remembered. Because of other commitments at the time I restric-
ted my purchase to only one pair, and eagerly awaited their arrival. The
birds duly arrived. In subsequent conversation with my friend Mr. Derek
Goodwin, he informed me that, to the best of his knowledge, the sexes of
nearly all Aplonis species were pretty much alike and that my birds were
almost certainly an adult and an immature A. panayensis , probably of the
race strigata. Much later, when Mr. John Yealland was kindly showing
me the single A. panayensis at the Zoo and telling me of their breeding at

the Zoo some years earlier, I mentioned my confusion over the sexing.
We then referred to the plate in Robinson and, sure enough, the caption
made it quite clear that the thrush-like figure was indeed an immature.
The young bird did not survive the winter, but to my delight Mr.
Burton still had one bird left from his consignment which he sent to me.
This bird lasted until the spring but was accidentally killed by a heavy
frost. The remaining bird, the original adult which was undoubtedly a
hen, went to the Zoo on my remove to Denmark, to pair up with the cock
bird there.
My experience with the species is thus limited to three birds over a
period of ten months. None the less, I hope the following notes prove
to be of interest to members. I would be grateful if anyone with further
experience felt moved to contribute further to the subject.
I have used the common name, Asian Green Starling, for Aplonis pan-
2 yensis, but it is possible--even likely--that any specimens being adver-
ised would be described as Malay, Thailand, Java, Sumatra (or wherever
.he consignment was shipped from, not necessarily the same as country of
origin), and then either Green Starling, Glossy Starling or Tree-starling;
Robinson calls A. p. stvigatus the Malay Tree-Starling. It is widely dis-
puted in Asia, ranging from East India and the Assam through south-
east Asia to the Far East, Celebes and the Philippines.

The adult birds are alike to look at. From a close examination of
dozens of adult skins of nearly all the races there appears to be no diag-
nostic aids towards sexing the birds at all. Quite possibly males are
bolder, and the male I studied at the Zoo was certainly much bolder in
posture than my own female. Total length about 8 |in. Basically, the
plumage is black, or blackish, with a green gloss in many places. The
feathers of the neck are lanceolated, but not to the extent of that of the
Asian mynahs. An outstanding feature is the bright vermilion eye. The
amount of green colouring and the extent of the glossiness is much less
than on the African Glossy Starlings. The bill and feet are black, the
soles of the latter grey.

The immature bird is greyer and not anywhere near as glossy above as
the adult; on the face it is lighter, and below it is a dirty white with black
streaks.
There are many races of A. panayensis , all fairly similar to each other
but, in general, the most isolated oceanic island forms (Samoa, etc.) are
the dullest and the largest, as with other groups of birds. My illustra-
tion and sketches show A. p. strigata , the most widely distributed race.
Voice
I never noted any of my three birds making a sound. The adult, even
when on a favourite perch basking in the sun, was silent. That this was
not necessarily a function of being single is evidenced by the lone male at
the Zoo who perched in front of me on two occasions and obligingly burst
into song. It was on these two occasions that I made sketches for the
male in the colour plate. The song was a typical squeaky whistling affair

It appears to be a social, noisy creature, highly gregarious and arboreal.
Large numbers live in towns where, presumably, their noisy chattering
until well after dark either causes annoyance or creates charming atmos-
phere, according to the disposition of the listener. Robinson says of its
flight " . . . swift and direct, though the bird often seems to have diffi-
culty in steering itself ". The flight my birds were in was over 17 ft. long
(plus 10 ft. of house) with a width of 11 ft., and yet they invariably appeared
to be aeronautically inept. The flight posture appears to be an inefficient
one, with the body slung low and the head slightly raised as if the bird is
straining for another few inches of altitude.
usually stand like this on shelves in shelter or
tops of walls, window sills, etc., also on floor
All three specimens had the habit of hopping or running (very quick!)
indeed through thick undergrowth) and they would quickly hide in an)
hole or cranny. They would also cling to the brick wall, in the corne
and scrabble upwards. Most noticeable of all the slightly eccentric post
ures of the species, however, is the standing stance shown in the plate an(
the sketches.
In my aviary it was totally inoffensive and docile, almost to the point 0
retiring timidity. It appeared to take no notice at all of other companions

peaceful too. When it bred at the Zoo it was in a community flight, ad-
mittedly a large one with medium to large companions, but apparently no
trouble was experienced. Comments regarding posture, etc., are left to
my sketches.
Food
No one should ever have any difficulty in feeding a starling, certainly
not a widespread typical bird like A. panayensis. However, I will list my
collected notes in the hope that they will be of interest.
Smythies (i960) says it eats mainly fruit, and that at Tarat near Serian
it is a major pest of pepper. Robinson lists food as various kinds of ber-
ries, the ground at the foot of the roosting places being littered with re-
jected seeds. " The fruit of various figs is an especial favourite, and a
fruiting tree of this species is crowded with this bird, fruit pigeons and
fairy bluebirds (Irena) " (Robinson, 1927).
Mr. Burton kindly filled in my standard questionnaire on feeding, etc.,
which I attempt to get completed before any purchase. From this, I
learned that the 24 birds in the consignment from Thailand (12 "hens ",
i.e. immatures, and 12 " cocks ", i.e. adults) were imported on Soya bean
flour and water melon. Mr. Burton weaned all 24 rapidly on to a diet
of live maggots, 'Sluis' brand universal food, soaked puppy meal, raw
minced meat and various fruit. They showed preference then for the
live food and the 'Sluis.'
I kept them with a mixed collection of birds, mostly softbills and
supplied most fruits in season, various softbill mixtures, including'Sluis'
Mynah food mixed with fresh meat finely minced, and soaked dried fruit
(e.g. California Raisins). The latter they certainly took. Mealworms
were supplied, and a handful was thrown around in the flight to stim-
ulate food-seeking behavior. In the case of Aplonis it was months before
they would drop to the ground to claim their share of the spoils, and
even then they were usually late. Remembering how arboreal they are
reported to be in the wild, I think the only reason they went to the ground
in the aviary is because that is where the cover was densest.
Nest and Eggs
The nest is usually in a cavity or crevice of some kind. It is a rough cup
of roots, grass and leaves (Smythies, 1940), and may be placed in a hole in
a tree, the cranny junction between the leaf and trunk on a toddy palm,
crevices in cliffs or under the eaves of roofs. It breeds socially (Robinson)
and in colonies (Smythies, i960). These two adjectives may indicate vary-
ing levels of nest density. The eggs are like small mynahs' eggs--glossy
blue with a greenish cast, speckled with brown mainly at the fat end.
Since breeding accounts are rare in avicultural literature, I hope I will
be forgiven for quoting in full the only accounts that I am aware of.

l6o ROBIN L. RESTALL--THE ASIAN GREEN STARLING
In the Aviculture Magazine, 1957, Mr. John Yealland wrote in his
London Zoo Notes: " The Malayan Glossy Starlings sent by Dr. Searle
several years ago have reared two young, one in each nest. This Starling
was bred in 1931 by Mr. A. H. Isenberg in California (A.M., 1931, p. 23)
but has not, so far as I know, ever before been bred in this country . . .
The nests were built in a crevice of the rock-work."
Mr. Yealland subsequently wrote (Personal communication, 1967) " In
January, 1955, Dr. Searle sent us four from Singapore and we kept them
in a large central aviary inside the Bird House. In 1957 two were bred
in this aviary, one in 1958, one in 1959 an( ^ one m *9^7 * * * Mr.
Yealland told me in conversation last year that the Starlings were later
transferred to one of the outside aviaries where they all did well, but they
never bred again. With the help of Mr. Prestwich I traced the reference
to the magazine for 1931, but this turned out to be, in turn, only a ref-
erence to Mr. Isenberg's report in Aviculture (1930) which I repeat below.
" Early in May, my Malay Glossy Starlings {Aplonis panayensis strigatus)
started carrying material into a log nest-box. I, unfortunately, avoided
looking into the nest, hence did not see the eggs, but according to Robinson
(The Birds of the Malay Peninsula) they are glossy blue with greenish cast
mottled with brownish blotches, three to five in number. The young
seemed to remain in the nest a very long time. They retain the striped
plumage until they molt when they start turning the glossy colour of the
adults. Due to a very late summer only one young survived. The other
one began breathing heavily, almost gasping for breath with its bill wide
open. This sickness, however, lasted several weeks before it proved fatal.
I have noticed this trouble with a few other species but most of them get
over it. The adults were fond of hardboiled egg yolk which they ate greed-
ily and then flew to the nest. They also took mealworms and other bugs
which they found on the lawn. They nested several times during the
summer and although they hatched young each time only one survived.
This bird has quite a pleasing song and also some power of mimicry; it
is well worth keeping and is quite harmless in disposition although cap-
able of protecting its nest from much stronger birds."
Conclusions
There are many races of the Asian Glossy Green Starling, but it is prob-
able that the only one imported is Aplonis panayensis strigata. After an
absence from the market of over 30 years (apart from a small trickle) the
species is now making more frequent appearances on the market. It is
smaller than the better known African Starlings or the Asian mynahs, and
is less colourful that the former. However, its peaceful nature and unde-
manding needs make it a suitable bird for mixed collections. The lack of
detailed knowledge about its behaviour also make it an interesting species
for the serious aviculturist to study. Breeding records are rare and it

SHORT NOTES ON SOME OF MY BIRDS
By Reinhard Hoppe (Berlin, Germany)
For 15 years I have kept native and exotic birds, chiefly insectivorous

pecies. I am particularly fond of the European warblers such as the
cterine Warbler, Hippolais icterina, Great Reed Warbler, Acrocephalus
rundinaceus, Marsh Warbler, A. palustris , and Sedge Warbler, A.
zhoenobaenus, as well as the Blackcap, Sylvia atricapilla, Garden Warbler,
bonn , Rufous Warbler, Cercotrichesgalactotes, Whitethroat, S. communis ,
nd Lesser Whitethroat, S. currucea. But my special favourites are
irikes and owls. Of the warblers I have kept an Orphean Warbler and
*\o pairs of Sardinian Warblers, S. melanocephala, for five years. The
Orphean Warbler S. hortensis, which, after the Barred Warbler S. nisoria ,
1 the lar g est of the European Sylviidae, is a good singer whose soft
)ng is midway between that of the Black-throated Thrush and the
rarden Warbler. This bird moults in winter and is therefore very
elicate during the first year in captivity and often does not undergo a
)mplete moult. A bird which has only moulted slightly or not at all
)0n becomes sickly and delicate as a result of the hormone control of
ie endocrine system being upset.
I have had good success in keeping these and other fruit-loving warblers,
* for example the Garden Warbler, which also moults in winter and can
iuse much anxiety, and with Blackcaps, Barred Warblers, Common and
esser Whitethroat and Sardinian Warbler when I give them a special
et. I mixed 50% curds with 30% fruit (apple, banana, pears, currants
1 figs) 10 / 0 glucose, 10% dried yeast to a mash of the consistency of
e dough of a cake and all the ingredients are finely cut into small pieces.

In place of the 30% fruit I also give a mixture of 15% fruit and 15%
spinach pulp (Baby food). To this mixture I add a few drops of the
multi-vitamin preparation prescribed for humans.
My birds have been fed entirely on this mixture for 18 months with
only the addition of a few mealworms each day. They are tempera-
mental birds which one would not expect to live for six years in captivity.
The mixture can be prepared in bulk and can be kept for weeks in a
refrigerator.
With the exception of the Great Reed-warbler, Reed, Marsh and
Sedge warblers are very delicate birds which at the time of the winter
moult can cause much anxiety. The majority of these species seldom
survive the first winter in good health and new plumage. They can only
be brought through the winter successfully if you can provide a great
deal of live food such as deep frozen fresh ant-eggs, wax-moths, crickets
and maggots. In addition it is very important for them to have good
light during the dull autumn and winter days otherwise the birds become
listless and refuse to eat. It is a good thing to keep several species in a
group in one small aviary. It is very helpful at the onset of the moult
if a day temperature with a maximum of over 28* C at midday is main-
tained; the minimum temperature at night can be 18 0 C. The daily
high temperature induces the moult and this can easily be achieved by
putting infra-red lamps near the cage. Also small quantities of the
hormone Testerone will produce good results.
The Great Reed Warbler is easy to keep if it is given the same food as
I give my shrikes. My shrikes--Lesser Grey, Lanius minor , Woodchat,
L. senator, Red-backed, L. collurio, Bay-backed L. vittatus and Rufous-
Backed L. schach erythropnotus are fed exclusively on living mealworms.
Once a week only they are given little strips of heart. In this diet it is of
the greatest importance that the mealworms should be regularly moistened
with a few drops of multiple vitamin preparation! If this important
requirement is not carried out the birds suffer from severe vitamin B
deficiency (polyneuritis, fits, epilepsy) or Vitamin A deficiency (Owl-face,
abcesses on the bill and feet). If large numbers of mealworms are given
without the addition of vitamins to shrikes, after six months in all prob-
ability it will be observed, by the evident discomfort of the birds, that
they have ailments of the feet; and they may fall from the perches. Othei
birds certainly develop thickening of the toe joint and considerable swell-
ing of the foot joints, as a result of being given too many mealworms. Ir
others abscesses develop at the base of the beak, on the head and so ovei
the eyes. These symptoms are all signs of severe vitamin A deficiency
and can be cured by prompt treatment with a vitamin preparation. They
never occur if regular vitamin treatment is given.
The Reed Warbler which I kept on this diet has remained in perfec
condition for six years, and the Shrikes for between three and four years
For four years I have kept Scops Owls, Otus scops, which I got fron

Yugoslavia. In the last few years they have bred regularly so I now have
six specimens; it is a delightful owl about the size of one's hand. The
sex can only be determined by the display call; from the beginning of
March to the end of May the male utters a melodious " Fhut-fhut " of
the tone of an Okarina, but the female's call is a much louder harsh
" koerk-koerk " with a loud trill. For the rearing of the young a great
deal of insect food (cockroaches, mealworms) must be provided or other-
wise the young birds eyes remain light grey for a long time and do not
change to the golden-yellow of the adult birds for several years. In the
wild their eyes become golden-yellow as soon as they are fledged.
By chance I own a South American Owl, a species which had never
before been brought alive to Europe. It is a species whose native name is
Lechuza cola larga ", Ciccaba virgata, and is a very nice owl which
appears to have been hand-reared as it was completely tame from the
start. He has regular conversations with my wife in which he answers
with a soft " muu " ora tittering " rikekekek ".
From the Berlin collector Bregulla, who has travelled in the Philippines,
I obtained a Shama, which had certainly never been brought alive to
Europe before. It is a small whitish-brown Shama, Copsychus lucionensis ,
with a compaiatively short black and white tail, orange rump and reddish
flanks. Two living specimens of this species were brought to Germany,
an old male which Dr Raethal of Berlin has and a young male, which has
a light grey sheen on the throat and which is in my collection. The bird
is easy to keep and has an extremely melodious low full-throated, flute-like
song of great purity without any disturbing harsh notes. Some stanzas
are an ascending scale dueli-dueli-dueli " followed by soft melodious
notes. The alarm call is a low panting " raaf-raaf-raaf ".
Since 1964 several European importers in Holland and Germany have
offered a Pygmy Falconet from the valleys of the Himalayas which pre-
viously had only rarely been imported--the Red-thighed or Himalayan
Falconet, or, according to the latest literature the Red-breasted Falconet
Microherax caerulescens. It is a very small falcon of about 18 cm.
in length of which 6--8 cm. consists of the tail. It has a black crown,
white neck-band, black shoulder feathers and white spotted patterns on
the expanded wings and tail. The anterior is white more or less mixed
with rust-red and it has a rust-red spot on the throat and deep rust-red
legs and belly. There were three young birds among my six specimens,
which are distinguished from the adult birds by a rust-red frontal patch
which in the adults is white. The bill is horn-coloured instead of black,
and the legs and belly are only light red. These falcons are outstandingly
&amp;gt;ocial; they carry out mutual preening, sleep close together in a sleeping
hole in a balanced body position like young budgerigars after they have
made a depression in the shavings in the sleeping-box by scraping and
turning round. Their notes are very varied--a loud " gia-gia-gig-gig ", a
hurried, angry " viss-viss ", a " hig-hig ", a grumbling " waed-waed-

datdatdatdat-hik " with a trill at the end, or a loud warning call " gigigigig "
which immediately drives them all into a panic in the sleeping-box.
This falcon is a plucky fighter which on being taken hold of pecks hard
and strikes with its claws, or when greatly disturbed lies on its back and
from this position attacks the aggressor with beak and claws. If you take
hold of these falcons they immediately peck hard, but if you take one out of
the sleeping box it lies quite quietly in the hand, eventually calls, but only
starts pecking when it recognises the hand in the light. This behaviour
evidently emanates from the social behaviour as they never peck each
other.
A species seldom kept in captivity is the large nectar-feeding bird the
Indian Streaked Spider-hunter Arachnothera m. magna. I obtained this
bird by chance from an importation by a German firm from the Himalayas.
This bird is a restless soul and is always on the move. It frequently
utters its loud call 4 4 kieuk-kieuk " and in addition has a soft, scarcely
audible song that always begins with a " wij-witte-wij " and then changes
to a rapidly uttered " wijwittewittewijwij ". Also there is a less frequent
throaty, very soft, noise heard when the bird is disturbed. I have had
it for two years and it is in perfect condition. Its food consists exclu-
sively of a fluid mixture consisting of 40% powdered milk, 30% soya
flour, 10% dried yeast, 10% powdered egg and 10% peptone from meat.
I mix a heaped teaspoonful of this with 50 ccs. water and add a teaspoonful
of honey, and once a week several drops of multivitamin.
Peptone from meat is a yellow, bitter powder and consists of tryptic
decomposed meat and therefore consists of simple protein cells. I purchase
it from the chemical firm Merck/Darmstatt.

(Rallus nigricans)
By G. R. Pryor (Calver, Derbyshire, England)
A pair of " Venezuelan Rails " were advertised in Cage Birds in June
1967. They arrived on the 13th and corresponded exactly to De
Schauensee's description in Birds of Columbia of the Blackish Rail,
Rallus nigricans. His description was:-- size 9--11 ins. Head and under-
parts ashy-grey with the exception of a white throat. Upper parts olive,
tail black. Bill yellowish-green, legs red.
They were placed in a heavily planted tropical house 44 ft. x 15 ft.
containing a mixed collection averaging 24 species and 36 specimens.
This house is kept at a minimum of 6o* F by gas-heated hot air blowr
through a waterfall to maintain humidity. A shallow stream runs frorr
the small pond at the foot of the waterfall the full length of the house

into an underground tank from where it is pumped back to the top of the
waterfall.
The only other ground birds in the main flight are a White-Winged
Trumpeter (P sophia leucoptera), a White-Breasted Waterhen (. Amaurornis
phoenicurus ), several Southern White-Breasted Crakes ( Later alius leuco-
pyrrhus). The last two of the Crakes were killed by the Trumpeter in
March of this year.
Extensions at each end of the house are wired off as separate aviaries
for Humming Birds, Aracaris, Toucanets etc., Since they were received,
the Rails have remained nervous and shy although if one remained seated
and still they resumed normal habits and could be observed. They made
no attempt to nest in 1967 or 1968. In June 1969 they built a shallow
cup-shaped nest on the ground, well covered overhead by ivy. The nest
was made of ivy leaves, pieces of iris leaves and so on.
The first egg was laid on 28th May and a second on 30th May. No
more were laid. The hen began to sit hard on 3rd June although some
incubation may have started before this. Two chicks hatched between
8 a.m. and 12 noon on 20th June. They left the nest before 8 a.m. on
21st June but return quite early each evening about 5 p.m. and were then
brooded by (presumably) the hen. On two occasions between hatching
and first leaving the nest they were being brooded by both cock and hen
on the nest together.
The foods normally available in the house include wheat, millet, coarse
soft-bill mixture, various fruits, meat, maggots and, of course, nectar
substitute and fruit flies for the nectar feeders.
The Rail chicks are fed by their parents with maggots which are put
in the stream so that the other birds will not get them.
As soon as the eggs hatched the Trumpeter was removed to an outside
aviary as he was considered to be a bad risk.

Me purchased the first two of these birds in 1965 and received four
nore in 1967. The first two were already in full colour. The later four
vere in intermediate brown plumage interspersed with pink feathers.
From the start all six birds have been kept in a large planted outdoor
viary of irregular shape but the floor space must be somewhere in the
egion of 2,000 sq. ft. The bushes are mainly elm suckers from an old
ree which was cut down many years ago and the ground is grassed. There

is a circular concrete pool some four feet across. Two wooden shelter
sheds are available in this aviary but the birds never roost in them even
in frost and snow, preferring the most exposed and highest perches at
night--rather like pheasants.
Scarlet Ibis are hardy, at any rate in north Somerset, where, although
the climate is perhaps milder than further north, we get our quota of
snow and hard frosts. Elsewhere in Zoos generally they seem to be
treated as hothouse birds and I cannot understand why.
At first they shared this aviary with various jays and pies and our
breeding colony of Sacred Ibis, but last year when they began to show
signs of nest building, the former were removed for obvious reasons!
Last year (1968) the Sacred Ibis nested for the first time and reared
two nice young ones and this triggered off nesting activities among the
Scarlets which squatted in the tops of the bushes and carried a few twigs
about, but went no further.
This year (1969) the Sacreds went to nest early and reared two more
young and then promptly laid again in the same nest and now (July) have
yet another two half grown.
In April the beaks of the Scarlets turned from brown to black and they
developed small ' wattles ' like those of a chicken at the base of the lower
mandible. In May two birds started carrying twigs into the tops of one
of the bushes so we made shallow baskets of \ in. mesh wire netting and
fastened these in similar situations.
A very sketchy nest was made in one of these and on the 14th May the
first of two eggs were laid--rather elongated in shape and coloured green
with brown spots at the larger end.
One of my reference books states that both sexes incubate. This I
can neither confirm nor deny as the birds are difficult to distinguish. In
fact I am not sure which of the six birds are the breeding pair. Due to
the breeding we let the aviary become rather overgrown and left the birds
as much as possible to themselves with the result that events were not all
that easy to watch without disturbing them.
The nestling-down is black. The legs are pink and the beak is pink
with a black tip. The beak of the chick is short to start with but it
lengthens as the bird grows, and turns black. The legs also darken with
age and at the same time the nestling-down is replaced with feathers.
Two chicks hatched on or about the 5th June and left the actual nest
on the 15th July. However, their flight feathers were not fully developed
and they stayed in the surrounding branches for a further 14 days before
beginning to move about the aviary. This early leaving of the nest may
have been due to the fact that the parents or another pair laid again
in the old nest and may have pushed them out prematurely on to the
surrounding bushes.

The nest feathering at this stage is charcoal grey above including the
lead, neck and beak, and dirty white below. The legs and feet have
urned black. They evidently have an intermediate phase between this
nd maturity as the birds we imported were brown and pink as already
[escribed.
The rearing was uneventful. Food supplied consisted entirely of fish
nd cut-up, day-old chicks and the young are fed by regurgitation--the
oung thrusting their bills down the parents' gullets. In addition the
*irds obviously find insect life and worms in the soft ground of their
viary judging by the multitude of small holes made by their probing
\0x25A0eaks.
Whilst writing this (July) two more eggs are being incubated and a
econd pair have laid. So it would seem that both Sacred and Scarlet
bis can be double brooded.
^ Now I would like to write a bit about the colouring of these birds,
he first two we had were in red importation plumage but moulted out
ink as was expected. The next lot of four were brown and moulted
ut pink. At the same time the older pair (second moult with us) became
onsiderably deeper in colour and since then, with every subsequent moult,
ley have all become brighter until last year and this year the two oldest
irds have been a deep orange-red, almost as brilliant as freshly imported
Decimens.
The only addition to their diet has been grass meal scattered on the
sh and meat. This was on the advice of Reginald Greed, the Director
f Bristol Zoo, who has a fine brightly-coloured colony of these birds
id swears by grass meal. It seems strange that a fish and meat eating
ird like the Ibis should benefit from a vegetable ingredient but there is
0 doubt about the brilliance of the Bristol Zoo birds which are kept
nder more artificial conditions than ours.
It is difficult to be absolutely certain about the effects of grass meal as
ir birds were becoming progressively brighter before we started using it.
loreover, some of ours are much brighter than others. One thing is
rtam, whether it is the grass meal or not, our birds are the natural
cranium red and not rose red which seems to be the effect of other
&amp;gt;louring agents.
As described by D. H. S. Risdon, the Scarlet Ibis (Eudocimus ruber) has
en bred at the Tropical Bird Gardens, Rode. It is believed this may
- a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species in
reat Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at once
th the Hon. Secretary.

(Erithacus rubecula)
By C. J. O. Harrison (Perivale, Middlesex, England)
The Robin, Erithacus rubecula , in spite of its tameness under natun
conditions in the British Isles, has always been regarded as a difficult bir
to breed under aviary conditions. The birds are very aggressive towarc
one another. In winter the hen holds her own separate territory
singing and warning off other birds of either sex. Pairing tends to be
cautious affair; and the experience of most aviculturists who have trie
to breed the species has been that one bird would invariably turn on th
other and kill it, although from the information which we now have
would seem that among insectivorous birds such behaviour is by no mear
confined to Robins. Although I am not able to record a complete succes
in breeding this species I feel that the information gained might be (
help to those who may try it in the future, and I have therefore kept sorr
notes of what occurred.
There are two claims for breeding this species in Britain. The firs
in 1869 (Smith) is very brief, with no details, merely claiming--" Unt
this year I have never been able to keep a pair of Robins in my aviary ;
one always killed the other. Now, however, I have not only succeeded i
doing so but they have actually made a nesit and succeeded in rearing
brood of three young ones ". The second is that of David Lack (Lac
1943) who during his study of this species bred these birds, two pai
being placed in each of two aviaries, one 30 ft. x 12 ft. x 6 ft. the otb
30 ft. x 20 ft. x 6 ft., both aviaries extensively planted and containir
shelters with brushwood in them. In each aviary a dominant pair succes
fully reared five young, mostly on mealworms. The birds were release
as soon as the young could fend for themselves. In reply to my enqui
Professor Lack informed me that the birds were obtained for him
Spring after they had paired, and he would therefore have avoided t
difficulty of reconciling the members of the pair to each other.
During the summer of 1968 I took over from two aviculturist acquaii
tances three young Robins which had been hand-reared after nests hi
come to grief in the wild. One, a female I believe, had been hand-rear&amp;lt;
in isolation from any other Robin and although it appeared to recogni
other Robins for what they were it also regarded humans in the same lig
and if allowed the freedom of an enclosure for an hour or so would take
over as a territory and vigorously attack anyone who entered it.
appeared to regard the person who fed it as a super-robin " unjusl
monopolizing a large food supply. Although it provided interesti
opportunities for study it was obviously unlikely to settle to breed wi
its own kind. The other two were from the same nest and were rath

iorc timid. Frank ]\leaden, when he saw them in partial juvenile
lumage, correctly sexed them as a pair.
W hen they passed into my care during August they were in juvenile
lumage but partially moulted, with some red feathering. I put them
imporarily into a cage, 4 ft. x 1 ft. 6 in. x 1 ft. and then, later in the
loult, transferred them to a compartment in a greenhouse about 3 ft. 6 in.
(3 ft. 6 in. x about 8 ft. in height. Its longest horizontal dimension was
lerefore a little less than that of the cage, but although the two birds had
greed together in the confined space of the cage they began to disagree
ithin about half-an-hour of having been transferred to the compartment,
his agreement in close cage confinement followed by fighting when a
ttle more space is allowed seems to occur frequently in insectivorous
irds, and the apparent concord between a pair in a cage seems to fool
lany aviculturists who are surprised when the birds are turned out into a
ood-sized aviary and one immediately turns on the other and frequently
ills it.
In this case the hen had a slightly short upper mandible which made it
lore difficult for her to seize and manipulate insects. She also had a
aler red breast. She was suffering from constant supplanting attacks
y the male which, while not directly harming her, were preventing her
om feeding or resting properly. I therefore transferred her to another
3mpartment 6 ft. x 3 ft. containing two young hand-reared Skylarks
luudci arvensis. She remained there for seven or eight weeks, agreeing
lirly well with the larks but attempting to snatch mealworms from under
leir very bills, only stopping short when they threatened her by crouching
ith bill open and head extended a little in forward threat. One day
awever I came in to find her perching on something and found that she
id rolled a lark over and was standing on it, digging her bill into its
reast feathers. I shooed her off and a rather dazed lark sat up. Since
xommodation was limited I had to put the female Robin back into a
ige a few feet from, and facing, the compartment in which the male
obin was now living with a pair of Painted Quails, Excalfactoria
&apos;inensis. d he latter were better able to cope with a Robin than were the
kylarks.
The Robins were fed on "Avivite " softfood, maggots, grated cheese,

tamin was given on a mealworm, d he birds also ate sprouted seed at

irases of increasing complexity, but the female and the other aggressive

and squabble through the wires. The nearest outside Robin territories
are about a quarter of a mile in each direction, but an overgrown bad
garden, 22 ft. x 100 ft., among the rows of neatly cultivated garden
provides a miniature woodland habitat which supports a single Robii
each winter but never retains a bird during the spring, and would appea
to lack some factor that would make it suitable for nesting. In th
winter of 1968-69 this territory was held by the usual Robin whicl
immediately began to visit the greenhouse in which the other Robin
were kept and spent a long time in mutual posturing through the glas
with the aggressive female. These bouts produced very little song an*
were marked by periods of excited " ticking " calls from the birds. A
in other years the intruder disappeared in spring, and this bird and th
aggressive female were the only other Robins that the pair saw or hearc
The male would begin to sing as soon as I entered the greenhouse, an
for as long as I stayed there. The song was vigorous but seemed nc
quite as loud as that of wild Robins, possibly because he never needed t
communicate to a trespasser at a distance. He would also sing when h
saw activity outside the greenhouse. The building is within a few fee
of the house and the light from the windows often shines into it at nigh&apos;
The Robin would sing vigorously while there was any kind of light an
activity in the house, well into the night; and if a light was put on at an
time of night it would be acknowledged by a sudden ripple of Robin son
out of the darkness. He appeared to prolong his evening activities by th
scanty light which shone in from the windows of the house, and on
would see him moving and feeding in semi-darkness.
During the winter the greenhouse was heated by an electric bar heatc
via a thermostat set for 54 0 F.; but with the heat loss through the glass 0
cold mornings the temperature might drop to the upper 30's producin
ice on the water in some compartments. The volume of song suggeste
very strongly that the male Robin, at this period, sang more frequently ;
lower temperatures. During colder weather song was prolonged but i
warmer spells it was less in evidence. One fine bout of song marked
failure of the heater, and dropped off rapidly when the greenhouse warme
up again.
In February 1969 the female was tearing the paper on the bottom &amp;lt;
her cage and dropping it in the drinking bowl, and I suspected that th
represented the commencement of investigation of nesting material. /\0x25A0

these passed through the central division. I put one of the two siblir

raising of the bill by the male. The hen was by now definitely carrying
about small pieces of grass and in a burst of fine weather the tem-
perature in the greenhouse in spite of a double roof and open windows
was rising into the 70's and 8o's. I decided that it was time for action
and on the evening of Friday, 22nd March, I bent down a corner of the
partition and allowed the birds to meet, relying on the week-end to allow
aie the chance of noticing if violence occurred.
In spite of my fears it did not occur. The birds invaded each compart-
ment in turn. When the male found itself near the female it displayed
3y raising its bill to show the breast not in the sleeked threat posture
preceding attack, but in what appears to be a more ambivalent posture
vith rather fluffed head feathers, and the central throat feathers raised to
ippear as a dark ruffled patch. It sang very subdued squeaky phrases.
The female's reaction was to gape towards the male when he approached
00 close, but gradually over a period of days this changed to food-begging
behaviour. I continued to put food and water in both compartments,
seeping the middle division in place with a gap at one corner allowing
he birds to pass. For the first few days the two birds returned to their own
lsual corners to roost. Otherwise nothing untowards happened. The
inapping out of territories by Lack in his study of the Robin revealed that
he female, after holding her own territory during the winter, often
amalgamated it with that of an adjacent male in the springs and I hoped
hat I had duplicated this situation in miniature
The hen was eager to build and on 24th March I offered a nest-site.
The first was a large flowerpot laid on its side in a corner; this she inspected
)Ut did not use. I then wedged a flowerpot up behind a diagonal support
t the back of the compartment, and she carried material to this but could
tot fix it in place. I substituted a narrow cardboard box c. 4 in. x 8 in. x 8 in.
agh. The female again found it hard to start a nest so I wedged in the
im of an old blackbirds' nest. The nest started with a few dead leaves,
tien the female changed to dried grass and within two days had wedged
ito the box a miniature haystack with a round cup in a cavity towards
ie back of it.
The female was now actively begging for food from the male, crouching
lightly with bill open and wings fluttering a little and uttering a squeaky
all. The male would hesitate beside her with a mealworm in his bill,
ppear to be about to feed her, then swallow it himself; and once he
latched a mealworm from her bill and ate it.
Several days after this the female was in the box long enough for me to
egin to worry that something might have happened to her. On Sunday,
tn April, I hastily inspected the box with a small mirror and found there
ere about four eggs. On the morning of 7th April she started to
leubate. It was not until the ninth day of incubation that I was able to
&amp;gt;tablish that the male was feeding her, when I saw him carry mealworms
ito the nestbox for her and later feed her when she left the nest.

The box had been wedged into position and the constant movement;
of the birds caused it to tilt. One evening the tilt was enough for me t(
decide I must remedy it in the morning when the birds could more safely
be disturbed, but needless to say an alarm in the night brought me out of;
bath to discover the nest tipped up, mercifully with entrance uppermost
and the two birds dashing about. I hurriedly wired the nest back in place
withdrew a little, and within two minutes the hen was back on the eggs
I have copied the lighting system used by Frank Meaden and can put ou
the main lights in the greenhouse and leave two dark red bulbs alight
The latter give enough light for a bird to find a perch or, if necessary
feed by; but are dim enough to persuade most birds to roost. I cai
switch these lights off from the house and can therefore use them fo
settling birds down before switching off the lights completely.
By the 12th day I started checking for possible hatching by putting m
hand into the nest when the hen was off. The female did not react bu
the male would dash past, striking my hand momentarily in passing, an&amp;lt;
perching with plumage aggressively streaked. By the evening of th
14th day nothing had happened but on the 15th (20th April) in the mornin
I thought I could feel a young one in the nest. I had a mealworm cultur
in a wooden box and I put this right into the compartment, stirring aroun
handfuls of the contents, in which were small mealworms in variou
stages and some meal moths. That afternoon I gratefully received fror
Alan Hayes, a fellow aviculturist, the welcome gift of a good culture c
the Greater Waxmoth in an insect cage. I offered these to the birds ths
evening and they avidly snatched up the moths. Next morning
noticed an eggshell and could now hear the young birds. For the ne&amp;gt;
few days I regularly stirred up the mealworm and moth cultures and fe
the normal food and hoped for the best.
On the fourth day after hatching a young one, about two days old, w;
found dead near the nest. Subsequent examination revealed an incoir
pletely absorbed yolk sac. On the fifth day additional maggots wei
offered. These were treated with Paladec multivitamin and heavil
powdered with scraped cuttlefish to provide some of the minerals an
vitamins needed by birds getting mainly maggots and mealworms. 0
the sixth day I removed from the nest two infertile eggs, and confirme
that there were two young in the nest, making a clutch of five. T 1
adults no longer showed much anxiety when the nest was examinei
On the evening of 27th April, the seventh day after hatching, the adul
were feeding and brooding the young normally. The next morning
found the two young dead and cold, with signs of violence, on the con
partment floor. I have commented on the possible causes of th
elsewhere (Harrison 1969).
By the evening of that day the nest was disarranged and the ma

FIRST BREEDING OF THE SOUTH INDIAN
(LESSER) HILL MYNAH

In 1968 a pair of South Indian (Lesser) Hill Mynahs successfully
iared two broods at this Sub-Department, apparently the first time that
fis race has been bred in captivity. The nomenclature of races of
[ill Mynahs will be discussed in another article. In the Avicultural
Iagazine in 1957 E. J. Boosey reported the breeding of a Northern
greater) Hill Mynah, Gracula religiosa intermedia , at Keston. In view
f the great differences in appearance, behaviour, and calls between these
ices, I feel that an account of the breeding of the Lesser Hill Mynah
7 . r. indica) would be of interest.
To supplement my field observations in India on the social and vocal
ehaviour of Hill Mynahs, a number of wild-caught adult indica were
nported in February 1967) selected from among the unfortunate birds
1 the Calcutta bird market. The birds were released into an outdoor

two small heater lamps suspended above the perches inside the shelter,
The shelter consists of an enclosed 3 ft. portion of the end of the aviary
The birds have access to this through a single small high entrance hole;
they always retreat thus when humans enter their aviary at the other end
and remain there invisible and undisturbed by the observer's actione
(e.g. inspection of nests) in the aviary until he leaves, whereupon the}
emerge at once. The shelter is accessible to humans from the back, anc
standing inside the dark shelter an observer can see and note the birds
behaviour through a darkened perspex screen, while being totally invisibh
to and undetected by the birds in the flight outside. This seems to b&amp;lt;
an excellent arrangement for observing and breeding timid birds. Rougl
nesting boxes are provided in the flight, and some of the birds roost ir
these. Water is always available in quantities sufficient for bathing
The basic diet supplied daily is Sluis' Mynah food, supplemented with ;
mixture of chopped-up apples, pears, carrots, hard-boiled eggs, meat am
maggots.
In the winter of 1967-68 there was a considerable amount of disturbano
through the construction of a large building beside the aviary. Whei
this was over, the aviary was prepared for breeding, more of the polythen
screening on the roof was removed, the birds were disturbed less, grass am
twigs were supplied, and new nest boxes with small entrance hole
surrounded with bark were put into the flight. The five birds in thi
aviary, all colour-ringed, were observed to consist of two pairs and ai
unpaired bird, with no signs of hostility towards one another.
First clutch
At the end of April 1968, two eggs, pale blue with small speckles c
pale brown were found in a hollow of twigs and grass in one of the nes:
boxes. The two birds of the breeding pair were easily distinguishabl
from one another by ring colour and wattle length; in this case the mal
had wattles considerably longer than the female's, but this is not a genen
distinguishing feature between the sexes. The breeding pair wei
chasing the other pair considerably and driving them down to the lowe
perches, but ignored the single bird. Hill Mynahs are nervous nester:
and this pair left the nest at the slightest disturbance, so little observatio
was consideied possible. Two young hatched, but died at five days ole
dissection showed them to have in their gizzards a tangle of coarse grai
and raw carrot, probably causing a fatal blockage. The lesson was learn
Subsequent nesting attempts were observed much more closely, and moi
effort taken to ensure their success.
Second clutch
Ten days later, the pair laid again, having added more grass to t!
nest since the last brood. Both sexes gathered and took in nest materk
approximately equally. The birds incubated sporadically and amazing

ittle, emerging from the nest usually after spells of only five to 15 minutes,
&amp;gt;r sooner if disturbed at all. Both sexes incubated, approximately
equally, although the female sat for somewhat more and longer spells.
The two birds of the pair were never both in the nest at the same time,
:xcept at night. The eggs hatched at 14 days, the young being naked
vith whitish hairy feather strands, a yellow edge to the gape, and with
yes closed. To avoid the earlier misfortune, all the grass supplied as
lesting material was removed from the flight, to prevent the adults
eeding their young on this inappropriate food, and carrot was dropped
rom the menu. A large amount of live insect food was also provided,
tarticularly chopped-up cockroaches, mealworms, maggots, and moths,
loth adults fed the young, one of which disappeared at three days old;
he male visited the nest less often than the female during the first eight
lays after hatching, but more often than the female thereafter. On such
isits, a portion of food is held in the beak, and more is regurgitated when
he parent bird is inside the nest. At nine days old, the chick was first
teard calling loudly while being fed; at this stage it was large with pin-
eathers appearing on its back. At 14 days, black feathers were beginning
0 emerge from the tips of the long pinfeathers. The head was somewhat
;reenish and still bald, with smooth bare yellow patches showing where
he wattles would later grow. The parent birds were feeding it almost
ntirely on insect food, causing considerable difficulties since they kept
hanging their tastes. Finely chopped cockroach was favoured at first,
hen rejected, and maggots freely taken; some days later they tired of
hese and insisted on moths, and later house-fly pupae. Young locusts
hey consistently scorned; mealworms and crickets they always took.
)bservation of them taking food to their nest was invaluable in detecting
vfien they were beginning to tire of a particular food type. If unable to
ind the preferred food, they did not take a less favoured food to the nest,
he parents were now chasing the other birds in their aviary so ferociously
hat these had to be removed, whereupon the breeding pair became much
~ss active.
On the 27th day after hatching, the young bird left the nest, to which it
.ever returned. Compared with the adults it was somewhat smaller,
vith pale yellow wattle patches rather than with pendant mustard yellow
aps, and with plumage sooty rather than glossy black. It flew strongly
rom the first. Within two days it was eating from the food trough,
lthough the adults occasionally also fed it thereafter.

On the day after the young bird left the nest, the first egg of a new
lutch of three was laid. Incubation as before took 14 days, with both
dult birds sitting usually alternately. Three young hatched, and one
ad disappeared after four days. The parents fed the remaining young

food-begging again much more than before, and thus successfully inter-
cepted a quantity of food intended for the next brood in the nest. Despiti

SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE LAUGHING
JACKASS OR KOOKABURRA
(Dacelo novaeguineae).
By Harry Frauca (Queensland, Australia)
Australia's famous Laughing Jackass, or kookaburra, is the world':

largest kingfisher. Its diet consists of small snakes, lizards, insects
crabs, mice, small rats and baby birds.
This bird, known by the scientific names of Dacelo novaeguineae
stands about 15-16 in. and has a 5 in. long tail. Its enormous bill is :
formidable cutting implement, and the muscles that power the mandible:
are as formidable, for the kookaburra can dig a nest in the almost-concret&amp;lt;
hard texture of a termite mound on a tree.
There are, in actual fact, two kookaburras in Australia; the blue
winged, or Leach's kookaburra (Dacelo leachii ), which ranges throughou
parts of Queensland, Northern Territory, north-west Australia an(
New Guinea and which doesn't laugh, and the laughing jackass, referrec
to above, which ranges throughout eastern and southern Australia. Th&amp;lt;
latter species was introduced into Western Australia in 1898, and int&amp;lt;
Tasmania in 1905, and appears to be thriving in both States, beinj
particularly common in certain parts of Tasmania where it is not evei
protected because of the damage it causes to bird life, attacking or robbing
the baby birds from nests.
The kookaburra is sedentary and lives either in pairs or in small groups
In the Queensland districts the species is found in all types of environ
ments: dry eucalyptus forests, margins of mangroves, seaside casuarin;
bush, margins of rainforest, tea-tree swamplands both at sea level am

high up in the ranges. It is found in almost all the suburbs of Queensland
country towns where it may breed in tree holes in suburban gardens as
a pair has done these past three years in a garden in my street. They
breed in the hollow limb of a gum tree.
The breeding season lies between early summer, November and
January, but I have known kookaburras that have bred before and after
that. All kingfishers nest in holes, and the kookaburra is no exception.
It will select the hollow limb of a tree or a tree hole, or will excavate a
nesting burrow r in termite mounds or trees, which are extremely common
in these parts of Queensland. Some of these mounds are so hard that I
have required a hammer to break through the clayey material, but the
kookaburra's bill and mandibles are sufficiently strong for the job.
After selecting a termite-mound, the kookaburra lands on it and clinging
to it with its claws, proceeds to peck away at the clay with its powerful bill.
Apparently, both hen and cock birds take part in burrow-digging and the
resulting burrow is about 14--16 in. deep with the entrance about 4--6 in.
across. In some cases the same pair of kookaburras may re-use last year's
burrow^ so that I know of some termite mounds that have had as many
as four kookaburra nesting burrows apiece. In this case the mound
becomes so badly riddled with holes that the birds have to look for a new
one come the next breeding season. In some areas, however, kookaburras
breed in hollow limbs or tree holes and some birds have been known
to excavate burrows on river banks, but I have not yet seen one in my
districts.
The hen lays between two and four eggs, each of which is white and
aiore or less round. While one bird incubates, the other hangs around
fie breeding area and will call loudly if a trespasser is seen. Should the
respasser be a human and should he get near the breeding tree, the
ncubating bird will usually poke its head out of the burrow and suddenly
ake off into the timber. Incubation lasts between 27-29 days, and the
&apos;oung at hatching are naked and blind and look nothing like the adult.
The eyes open when about 10--12 days old, and it takes the young about
1 month to leave the nest. Thereafter they stay with the parent birds
or about two months more.
On many occasions when spotlighting in the bush at night during late
ummer I have caught four or five kookaburras perching completely still
nd close to each other on a tree branch, probably a young brood and
he parents passing the night away under the bush sky.
Kookaburras pounce regularly on lizards of various sizes, small snakes,
isects, baby birds and field mice and rats. One nest investigated in
^ew South Wales, for instance, was found to contain the remains of 16
ats, and an observer in New South Wales recorded seeing a pair of
ookaburras bringing to their nest 19 baby wood-swallows in about two
ours. Kookaburras will often tackle large snakes, about 4 ft. long or so,
ut they are not always successful in killing these serpents. Australian

178 H. FRAUCA--OBSERVATIONS ON THE LAUGHING JACKASS OR KOOKABURRA
naturalist A. H. Chisholm, for instance, reported: " I have records of two
cases in which enterprising kookaburras were in a bad way . . . while they
were choking the snake, the snakes were choking them. "
The killing behaviour of this bird is like this: it will pounce on, say, a
lizard, of any size, and seizing it in its bill by the neck, it will kill it by
bashing it against the ground or, taking it up a tree limb, it will bash it
against a tree limb. Apparently, kookaburras are stimulated to attack and
to kill long things at once. We had one in our aviary that would pounce
on string beans and spagetti; seizing each in its bill, it would bash it
against the ground until it was " dead ", whereupon, the bird would
swallow it.
Kookaburras are very conscious of hawks and eagles and when one of
these predators flies overhead, the laughing jackasses will almost always
assume a cryptic attitude, remaining completely still and, often, pointing
the bill skywards to cut down their true configuration.
Recently, while taking pictures of a young kookaburra near the local
aerodrome, I noticed with amusement, that every time an aircraft passed
low overhead, the bird would immediately assume a cryptic attitude.
Apparently, the shadow of the aircraft suggested a predatory bird to my
kookaburra.
Its laughter is, of course, a part of the various calls and sounds it has
evolved. It is in fact its language. But during a certain time of the year
usually between breeding seasons, groups of these birds tend to gather on
tree limbs, house roofs, television aerials, basketball posts and whatevei
heights are available, and break into concerts during which their mac
laughter reaches an almost deafening intensity. It is then when one car
understand Sturt's reference to " a chorus of wild spirits.
To man the kookaburra is a completely harmless bird, but I sav,
something once that is worth relating. My friend Paul Farmer is one 0.
the most expert tree-climbers I have known, and because of this ability
I asked him to climb to a kookaburra nest in the hollow limb of a loft)
gum and inspect it for me. Paul climbed up there and was peering int(
the hollow limb when suddenly one of the parent birds flew from 1
nearby tree and swooping down, struck a blow with its bill on Paul!
head. Paul howled with pain as blood streamed down from a cut 01
his scalp. But the kookaburra was feeling no better. After hitting nr
friend, it literally collapsed to the ground, stunned by the impact 0
the crash. I was going to pounce on it when it came round again, an(
staggered away into a patch of grass from where it eventually took of
in a clumsy flight. I don't think that kookaburras usually attack man.
think that in our case, the bird wanted to frighten Paul, but it miscalculate!
its dive and accidentally, hit the human with the bill. If kookaburra
were in the habit of crashing against intruders, many birds, I think
would be seriously hurt in the process.

(Columbina buckleyi)
By Donald G. Hanover (Tarzana, California, U.S.A.)
It is always a great satisfaction when a fancier of foreign doves can add
a brand new species to his collection. This satisfaction was mine when
I was able to import a number of Buckley's Ground Doves Columbina
buckleyi into this country; so far as I am able to ascertain a first importation.
Since that time, it has been my good fortune to see these lively little doves
breed successfully in my aviaries and to raise a number of youngsters,
which have left their nests and are now independent. In view of the
foregoing, I am pleased and proud to be able to submit the following
report on the first breeding of Buckley's Ground Dove in the United
States.
Description
I think I can best quote that given by Derek Goodwin in his Pigeons
2nd Doves of the World :-- Approximately the same size as the Ruddy
Ground Dove, and of similar proportions. Forehead and face pale
greyish-pink shading to slightly deeper mauve-pink, suffused with grey,
on breast and underparts. Crown and nape bluish-grey. Upperparts
pale brownish-grey, wing-coverts pinkish-grey spotted and barred with
black. Primaries and outer secondaries mainly black. Central tail
feathers greyish; remainder black with some grey at base, outermost
ones tipped white. Axillaries and underwing coverts black. Female
rather browner and less pinkish, especially on breast. Juvenile brown
with pale or rusty edges and/or centres of feathers in areas where adults
ire pinkish or greyish.
Distribution and habitat
North-western Ecuador south to north-western Peru. Confined to the
irid tropical zone.

\\ ill eat most small seeds and grains from the size of grass seed up to
Vlilo. Actions are typically dove-like, but swift and precise. These
ively little doves enjoy being in groups, both on and off the ground:
hey are sociable. Being rather recently imported, they are still flighty
ind nervous. However, they undoubtedly will settle down after becoming
iccustomed to their captive surroundings.

J. J. YEALLAND--SOME BIRDS OF THE ARCTIC
Nesting
The nest of the Buckley Ground Dove is not a typical pigeon or dove
nest, it being much more compact, much deeper, and more birdlike in
construction. Pine needles were the principal materials used. Two
white eggs were laid on 15th and 16th April 1969. The first egg hatched
on 28th April, the second 29th April, thus totalling 14 days for incubation.
The young fledged at the age of 12 days. As of this writing, 24th June
1969, I can as yet discover no change-over to adult plumage.
In my experience, the parents have proved the most protective of any
species of foreign doves it has been my privilege to raise. Whenever I
approached their nest, they would immediately stage the " broken-wing '
act on the ground. When the young left the nest, their parents would
drive off all other doves that ventured near them. I had three pairs
nesting within four days of each other, and as the young fledged I noticed
this protective aggression on the ground and on perches for a period of
approximately two days and up to a distance of 3* feet from the nest.
All three pairs nested again at their original sites. I have, in the past,
noticed similar protective aggression from Green Imperial Fruit Pigeons
and Wonga Wonga Pigeons with newly-fledged young, but to a much
lesser degree. When the young Ground Doves reached the age of three
weeks the adults nested again, which suggests that they are a very prolific
species.

By J. J. Yealland (Binstead, Isle of Wight, England)
Svalbard is a group of islands covering some 25,000 square miles and
situated approximately 400-500 miles to the north of Norway. By far
the largest island is known as Vest Spitsbergen and the area with which
we are here concerned, Kapp Linne, is situated on the western coast at
Isfjord.
The ornithology of the group has been well studied, particularly in
recent years by Lovenskiold and others. An account of the birds seen
during a stay of six weeks in the summer of 1964 was written by M. A.
Ogilvie and R. J. F. Taylor (1967, Ibis , 109 , 3,299-309.) who traversed
the area from Isfjord south to beyond Bellsund.
It was on 24th June 1968 that Jack D'eath and I set off for Isfjord, and
early in the morning of the 25th we arrived at Tromso where we were to
embark on a ship that was cruising between Bergen and about 8o* N. on
the western side of Spitsbergen. In Tromso Common Gulls were about
the streets near the quay and a tame Magpie was investigating refuse bins
n the streets. At about 7.0. a.m. we left and proceeded in bright sunlight

through the beautiful Tromso Fjord, calling at Hammerfest and
Honnigsvag.
Some Shags, a Black Guillemot, Guillemots, Kittiwakes, Common
Herring, Great and Lesser Black-backed Gulls and a few Arctic &apos;ferns
were seen. The Lesser Black-backed Gulls in this area are not easily
distinguished from the Great at a distance, for the back and wings are
quite black and not dark grey as in more southerly birds. The next day
was dull and wet, the ship stopped off Bear Island for the unloading of
some supplies. Some Fulmars were met with during the day and next
morning a few Little Auks, Black Guillemots, a Puffin and some Eider
Ducks were seen. Early in the afternoon we landed at Kapp Linne and
were soon installed in the old radio station, a wooden building where we
lived in unexpected comfort, for there was a fireplace, plenty of wood and
coal and even a fully operational electric cooking stove, while, since the
food supplies had been organized by Jack D'eath, with no item'forgotten,
we lived at a standard not usually associated with Arctic expeditions. On
arrival we met Dr. Norderhaug and two colleagues who had been staying
in this building and making a study of the breeding birds, collecting
insects and doing other research on behalf of the Norsk Polarinstitutt.
They left that night for Prins Karls Forland, a large island to the north-
ward, but before they went Dr. Norderhaug took us to see the very many
nests, particularly of Eider Ducks, around the station. There were then
a few nests of Arctic Tern; he also showed us a nest of Grey Phalarope
and one of Snow Bunting which was very neatly constructed in a rock
crevice and lined with white hairs of Reindeer. This nest contained six
eggs and another that we found later, an untidy structure situated in a
crevice on the face of the low cliff at the entrance to the fjord, contained
young.^ While we were out with Dr. Norderhaug two of what we thought
were Common Scoter flew over, but we did not see them again. Of
the Grey Phalaropes that were about the shallow lakes and pools near
the radio station we saw only the one male, so perhaps any others were also
incubating eggs, though we did not see any other nests and would probably
not have known of the one had not Dr. Norderhaug showed it to us.
There was some variation among the female Eiders, some of them
^eing quite grey with the darker markings more conspicuously con-
:rasting; we did not, of course, get so close a view of the drakes, many of
*vhich, when we arrived, were sitting about among the nests, but they
appeared to be exactly like the nominate race, not having the more yellow-
sh hill of borealis. There were several pairs of King Eiders nesting among
he others near the station and a few Long-tailed Duck. We did not ever
iee any of the ducks feeding with the exception of a drake Long-tailed
vhich was sometimes diving just off the shore. The female Eiders, so
ar as we knew, never left their nests except when approached quite near
in .d then they would not go far and quickly returned. It is stated in
hrds of the Soviet Union , vol. iv, that " Female almost never leaves nest

after conclusion of clutch, towards end of incubation sitting so attentively
that she may sometimes be picked up, and, probably refraining entirely
from food at such times, subsists chiefly on fat deposits. Weights during
incubation consequently drop by some 39% * * * * O ne of the sitting
birds was quite unafraid of us and I was able to insert a thermometer
between her and the eggs on several occasions and found that the temper-
ature there ranged between 103* and 103.7 F. The nests had little down
in them and the birds seemed to prefer nesting either in a depression in
the ground or among scattered small heaps of pieces of wood left about
when the new radio station was built. One nest was among a lot of
empty bottles and there were others among heaps of scrap metal: there
was one quite near our hut at the foot of a wire stay supporting the flag-
pole and surrounded by tethered husky dogs at a distance of no more than
30 to 60 yards. Except for the area of four or five acres around the radic
station we saw few birds and no nests and it would be very interesting tc
know how long it took the birds or their ancestors to discover that the}
could more safely nest near the station than further off from it. There
was one Eider's nest close up against the wall of the new station and we
noticed that the nests furthest from the buildings were the first to have
the eggs taken by the Glaucous Gulls and presumably by the Arctic Skuas
of which there was at least a pair about the area, but on the 6th of Jul)
there came a greater menace--an Arctic Fox which we immediatel)
noticed because of the great clamour made by the Arctic Terns mobbing
it. It was running from one to another of the furthest nests and as soor
as it came in the vicinity nearly all the male Eiders left the nesting are.
and no longer sat about among the nests, but we continued to see som&amp;lt;
on the sea and on the rocky islets. A day or two later a second fox came
one was much bolder than the other and by concealing himself by a rock
Jack D'eath obtained excellent film sequences of this animal. They die
not come every day, nor, so far as we knew, did they come before 6th. Jul;
The day before this the first of the Eider ducklings hatched in a nes
near the cliff; there were three eggs from which two normal health;
birds emerged, but the third egg contained a laggard which, when tw&amp;lt;
days later the mother and two chicks had gone, lay dead in the nest. Wi
did not see the going of this family, but in the ensuing days others hatche&amp;lt;
and went off into the fjord and presumably they went up the fjord wher
it would certainly have been more sheltered from a persistent cold wester!
wind. Generally the families were accompanied by what the radi
station men called " aunties " and these were presumably females tha
had lost their eggs to the predators. The " aunties " that we saw wit
one family numbered seven, the eighth bird being the mother, but whic
she was there was no telling and whoever she was she had no objection t
the rest of the company. Presumably this habit is of benefit to th
mother and young, for it would certainly help to protect them and migf
give the mother opportunity to find food for herself. Where the familit

went or for how long the " aunties " stay with them we did not discover.
One morning I saw a mother with two ducklings in the sea at the foot of
the cliff where it was about 20 feet high and while I watched a third
duckling scrambled out from among the rocks close in under the cliff,
and evidently these had come from a nest near the edge and had jumped
over. There were no " aunties " with them so they apparently had not
tra\elled overland for very far or they would have collected some.
Some nests contained as many as eight eggs, but whether all were laid by
the one bird there was no telling; it seems unlikely that the birds would
leave their nests for long, if at all, after the laying of the first egg, for if they
did the gulls would soon take the eggs. In that tundra type of country
there is little cover and not much vegetation suitable for the covering of
such large eggs, so even when eggs are covered with down, the nest is
still fairly conspicuous. Close by a track that we took whenever we or
the radio station staff went towards the sea there was a nest of King Eider,
but the bird was more nervous than the others and would fly off as soon
as anyone approached within about 30 yards. The down is, of course,
much darker than that of the Common Eider, so the nest is easily indenti-
fied even if the owner is not seen. The males were very spectacular in
their full breeding plumage; they seemed to spend most of their time on
the shallow lakes, but were sometimes to be seen on the sea. I once saw a
pair at some distance from the station on a recently thawed lake, but
whether they had a nest close by is doubtful and I did not see them there
*?ain. The orange of the male s facial area looked much brighter than that
of any of the captive ones that I have seen. None of the King Eiders
oad hatched their eggs by the time we left and whether they also go with
heir ducklings to the fjord or whether they go to the fresh water lakes
s not known.
There were at least two nests of Long-tailed Duck near the station and
)n ra re occasions we saw one or two Pink-footed Geese flying over.
At one place along the shore, where a quantity of seaweed had been
vashed up, one could be sure of seeing Turnstones and Purple Sandpipers
vhich were quite approachable, the latter often performing the character-
stic wing-raising action as one drew near. It is difficult to explain this
ction, for it appears neither a concealment nor an aggressive posture.
)n the seaward side of Kapp Linne, close by the low cliffs, the Fulmars
vere often passing up and down; I thought one or two rather paler than
thers, but it may have been the effect of the light and we did not see any
f the light phase birds there. Occasionally a few Little Auks were seen
ver the fjord and once or twice a Black Guillemot: a Great Black-backed
juII appeared one day and a Ringed Plover was about the station for a
2w hours. The Kittiwakes often passed over, but did not stay about the
tation as the Glaucous Gulls did, the attractions being presumably the
efuse tip at a cleft in the cliff, the eggs, of course, and the occasional
-a left at the jetty by a patrol boat, the carcasses being used as dog food

j8 4 J. j. yealland--some birds of THE ARCTIC
and the skins preserved. We found several dead birds that were plump
and in good plumage, so did not look as if they had suffered any long
illness, nor was there any obvious sign of injury. There was a female
Eider, a Black Guillemot, a Grey Phalarope, a Purple sandpiper and a
Little Auk, the last being underneath an overhead cable that led to a
light beacon, so may have flown into it, though, of course, at that time of
year there is no darkness, but there is sometimes mist.
It was difficult to detect what the Snow Buntings were feeding on,
so rapid were their movements, but it must have been the tips of moss.
One bird came sometimes and picked about under the kitchen window
of the radio station where no moss grew and it must have found some
scraps of human food there. I put some rolled oats on the ground in
front of our windows and this was soon found, the bird eating some and
flying off with a beakful. There was very little in the way of insect life
on the land and all we ever saw was a very few black flies, and even under
pieces of wood that had lain for a long time on the ground there was no
visible sign of life. There must have been something in the decaying
seaweed and something in the shallow pools and lakes that provided food
for the waders, though we never saw them feeding. On the stony beach
there were few shells of small molluscs washed up; there was food thai
the Arctic Terns, which appeared to increase in number while we wert
there, were finding just off the shore, but they had to work hard for r
and by no means every dive was successful. The Grey Phalarope's eggs
disappeared one night, but whether hatched or taken we never knew
The nest was rather far from the station, so, like others on the perimete:
of the nesting area, it was probably robbed. We wondered how many o
the Eider ducklings from this area could survive the predators and th&amp;lt;
rigours of their early lives; even ducklings that got safely to the se.
would have a long journey in cold and choppy water before reaching &amp;lt;
sheltered place further up the fjord. The men at the station never moles
the birds except for the Glaucous Gulls of which they shot several whil
we were there, and do so every summer, but this is done to protect th
Eiders for which the men have a friendly regard. One of the men sau
he had heard a Red-throated Diver, but we did not ever hear or see on
and when we arrived the fresh water was mostly frozen over, so, thoug
this species is in the area, it is perhaps not usually so far to the north o
comes later.
One morning we were awakened at about four o'clock by some of tn
station staff who were about to set off with tractor and trailer with co;
and other supplies for a hut some four miles to the south. These hut
are used by trappers and are kept provisioned for their use. We were t
have spent the day there, but the tractor became stuck fast in the sno'
when we were crossing the bed of a stream, so we proceeded on fo(
with enough food for breakfast. On an islet just off the coast we saw
Barnacle Goose and two Pink-feet flew over, but apart from them an
some Kittiwakes, we saw no birds.

Here and there along the shore there were stoutly built wooden traps in
he form of a raised narrow open-fronted box of two compartments. At
he front is the bait, a piece of fat attached to a wire which, when pulled,
ires a shot from a pistol in the inner compartment. These traps are for
) olar Bears, but are to be discontinued because, of course, they sometimes
ill a mother bear which may have one or two dependent cubs. The
tears had gone north, presumably following the seals, and the only
nammals we saw apart from the foxes were the local population of four
teindeer, one of which at intervals of several days worked its way round
a the front of the station to graze on the mosses and lichens. There are
-lusk Oxen in an area further up the fjord inland from Longyearbyen,
ut how many and when they and the Reindeer were introduced we did
ot discover. There are no small mammals and so foxes must live mainly
n the birds and must store them in considerable numbers for winter food.
For some miles to the south of Isfjord there is an area of flat tundra
rom one to two miles wide and this appears as if it must be made
p of stones, sand, etc. thrown up by the sea and also deposited over the
ears by erosion of the mountains to the eastward. The reason for thinking
us is that here and there, as much as half a mile from the existing coast-
ne, there are vertebrae and ribs of whales, some partly buried and
pparently of considerable age, that must have been, presumably, washed
p on what was then the shore line. I found a piece of walrus tusk, but
appose that it is many years since this species lived in those islands.
W hen, two weeks later, the next ship called on its northward way, I
ubarked because of wanting to see more of the fjord and the small coal-
lining towns of Longyearbyen and Ny Alesund. At Longyearbyen it
as much warmer than at Kapp Linne, for it was sheltered from the
esterly winds. Here the plant life was more advanced and Dryas
topetala already in bloom, while a species of poppy grew much larger
ere than it was at Kapp Linne.
Above the straggling town was an entrance to a coal mine in the hillside
id much higher still could be seen Little Auks flying about and presumably
ey were nesting there. A mining official who was feeding some quite
me Kittiwakes outside his hut told me that he had seen six Arctic Foxes
1 the hillside that morning. One of the Glaucous Gulls about the town
id a bright red head and had evidently been feeding inside a carcass,
r it did not look like a bird that had suffered in a fight. A little further
wond the entrance to the mine was a favourite place for visitors to search
r fossils brought there by a glacier; I brought back an almost complete
if that resembles some of the Miocene period.
At Ny Alesund, further to the northward, I saw a Ringed Plover,
rhaps our visitor of a few days before; also a Dunlin, Grey Phalarope,
arnstones, a few Eiders and Snow Buntings. The ship proceeded
*rthward, but not quite to 8o* N. because of mist and the presence of
-bergs. Back in Isfjord and after a second call at Longyearbyen, we

were taken to see a glacier, the ship sailing quite close in towards the fac&amp;lt;
which towered above the sea. Late that night, in gathering mist, w*
arrived off Kapp Linne, Jack D'eath embarked and we took leave of ou
kind friends of the radio station which, together with oui erstwhil*
desirable residence, soon faded from sight.
We arrived back in Tromso on July 15th and flew to Oslo where w
stayed the night. On a large lawn in the city we saw a Redwing and som
Fieldfares, while about the harbour were many Black-headed Gulls,
species which does not normally venture as far north as Spitsbergen
there are only two records for the area.
In spite of much dull and cold weather, not conducive to outdoo

to Spitsbergen, which is also a record of an extremely interesting an&amp;lt;
perhaps unique concentration of breeding birds.

By G. A. Smith (Peterborough, England)
My interest in these parakeets started when, as a child, I used to re&amp;lt;
the only two available bird books in the local public library. The
author, the Rev. C. D. Farrar, was a very successful aviculturalist
half a century back, and wrote most entertainingly about his stock. H
enthusiasm for keeping New Zealand Parakeets must have overflowed in
myself and has stayed with me since. The books, since those war da)
have long ago been pulped in some improvement scheme; so that I cann
verify as to what he actually wrote concerning them. However, I &amp;lt;
remember that they seemed to possess all the possible psittacine virtues-
low voiced, beautiful, tractable, of extreme fecundity and had no sexii
problems. And yet to counterbalance these perfections they, unfortunate
just when things seemed to be going along most swimmingly, died li
flies--of no apparently known malady. Other and later authors seem
substantiate him fully on these points. Inexplicable and it seems inevital
early demise is the worst of possible faults for an aviary bird to possess a;
they consequently were often given up as worse than useless .
Even in the wild they do not seem to be able to maintain their numbe

specialized species the clearance of the forests and the introduction of
modern agriculture should have benefited them as much as it has the
closely related Australian Platycercines. Only on the outlying islands do
they seem to hold their own.
W hen I eventually had receipt of my birds they were even more
delightful than I had thought possible. From the illustrations in Buller,
and fiom examining skins at South Kensington I was prepared for their
appearance; but no description, not even the eulogizing of Farrar, had
done them justice. Both the Red-fronted and the Yellow-fronted were
turned out provisionally into flight cages. W ithout any more ado they
immediatel} started cracking seed and sampling the various greenstuffs
provided as if they had lived in these cages all their lives. They didn't,
to my ears, " bleat like sheep heard in the distance ", nor did the call even
caguely sound like Buller's "twenty-eight"; but they staccatoed away
like miniature magpies. A sort of low-sounding polysyllabic call.
Presumably like that used by titmice, serving to keep the community
together when travelling through dense vegetation. The Red-fronted
were quite beautiful--of a Stanley Rosella size with a body of purest
parrot green, shading into a lighter yellowish green on the abdomen and
Test, a contrasting red head, and a bluish margin to the primary feathers.
The legs look incongruous, as if they had been designed for a somewhat
arger bird.
The Yellow-fronted was different altogether, being a smaller bird, with
i proportionately longer tail. 1 he green of its plumage was not quite so
Jure in tone, the red somewhat muddy and the yellow of the head quite
Jingy. The legs were even more ungracefully long. Both species of birds
lave the irises blood red in the male, slightly more orange-toned in the
emale. Whereas in larger Red-fronted they look quite appropriate, in
he Yellow-fronted they give it a wild-eyed look suggestive of incipient
nadness. It et how charming they are. So very confident and with all
he " cheek " of a London sparrow. They scratch with a lateral sidewards
notion when they are feeding. Their general pert manner is reminiscent,
nore especially so in the Yellow-fronted, of a blackbird, or perhaps an
iwkwardly large titmouse handicapped with big awkward feet and rather
hin long toes. Their appetites seem insatiable--not as regards seed,
nost of which is wastefully scattered with their hen-like scratchings
unless fed from a bevel-sided dog's drinker bowl)--but of vegetation and
ruit. Leaves of groundsel and chickweed are chewed off the plant and
wisted and turned in the beak, ever diminishing in size, until it disappears
Ten another portion is immediately bitten off. Occasionally a foot is
ised to hold some item down or to lift it up to the head. With regard to
eed they seem to be most fond of hemp although all the commonly-fed
eeds are also eaten.

on the heads of both, and the yellow on the smaller species, that enabh
one to see the birds at all. Red and yellow are common " signal colours '
in many species. Presumably the coloured foreheads are of value to thf
parakeets themselves in distinguishing one another when they are so wel
camouflaged. In another parakeet, the budgerigar in its wild greer
coloration, I have similarly noticed that it is only the yellow foreheac
again that can be made out, and this with some difficulty, when they an
grazing green grass.
Cyanoramphine parakeets must be as hard as nails. Subspecies o
the Red-fronted used to live on the almost Antarctic, extremely mhospit
able, Macquarie Islands whose climate must be akin to the Falklands
where, like the same subspecies still found on the equally drear anc
treeless Antipodes Island, they must have derived a considerable propor
tion of their diet from the skins and carcasses of dead penguins.
Phe relationship of size of bill to size of bird is quite interesting in thi.
genus. The larger the bird the more geometrically disproportionate th&amp;lt;
size of the beak becomes. This relative growth applies not only betweei
male and female, the hens being slightly smaller than their mates anc
having beaks of, relatively, extreme difference in size; but also withir
species where the largest of all the Antipodes Island Parakeet (Cycmoramphu
unicolor ) though only 12 in-13 l*ng, ^ as a beak that would not dis
credit a macaw, and the smallest the Alpine, or Orange-fronted Parakee
(C. malherbi ), 8 im-9 in. long, has a beak of most modest proportions like
that of a grass parakeet. Phe Red-fronted ( C. novaezelandiae ), iOo in.
12 in., and the Yellow-fronted (C. aunceps), 9 in.-ioj in., take up ;
relative intermediate position.
Courtship and nesting behaviour are rather like a benignly reformat
version of Rosella behaviour. The cock feeds the hen (I have seen th&amp;lt;
hen in her turn feed a rather puzzled-looking cock). No driving of th&amp;lt;
hen takes place. Pie runs along the branch on which she is standing
alternating the direction in which he faces with each step, while she coyl;
retreats ever more slowly away from him. While so advancing the pupil
of his eyes contract and expand and he utters an excited feeding call note
Suitable nest sites are investigated by the cock who enters first and ty
" encouragement noises " actively entices the hen to enter. Sometime
both birds remain in the box together: more usually the male would sta
outside sitting by the entry hole whilst the hen was within. Having
once selected a suitable box, an ever-increasing large amount of the hen'
time will be spent within, chewing up the rotton wood on the floor 0
the box and divesting herself of abdominal feathers with which the bo:
is lined. When the decision over the acceptability of the box has beei
made the hen always roosted at night within it. Initially this loosing th&amp;lt;
company of their wives used to unnerve both cocks, and as the evening
drew darker, much time was spent by the cock birds in trying to persuade
the hens to forsake their boxes and roost with them in the safety of th

shelter. ^ On one occasion the Yellow-fronted cock, quite exasperated by
his hen s refusal to come out in response to his blandishments, went in
and drew her out forcibly by the wing feathers. This roosting and
otherwise spending long periods of time in the nesting cavity long before
the eggs are actually laid must serve to dry the bedding. Eggs were not
laid until exactly ten days after the first observable copulation, and a
fortnight or three weeks after deciding on the site. Treading of the hen,
as with cockatiels, seems to be part of the " pair bond " and may take
place daily, or more frequently, irrespective of whatever stage of nesting,
though probably the incidence drops off as the chicks start to grow.
As is usual in parrots the eggs are laid on alternate days. Incubation
takes 19 days for both species--excluding, of course, the first one or two
eggs laid. The total clutch size was 5-9 eggs. They are excellent
parents, the hens especially so. Several times a day the cock bird having
fed, would call, in very respectful and subdued tones outside the nest hole.
He might then go inside, presumably on her invitation, or go about his
business. After 10 or 12 seconds inside the next box the two would
emerge. He would then feed her, she would preen herself, perhaps have
1 bath, eat a little seed and greenstuff and then go back to the nest. The
Dald abdomen and lower chest of a hen, where she had plucked out her
eathers to extend her brood patch, looked particularly noticeable when
hey clung to the wire to plead for tit-bits.
The youngsters are clothed with a grey down, and seem after a poor
itart to grow surprisingly rapidly. The eyes open on about the eighth
&amp;gt;r ninth day, and about this time they start quilling-up. By the third
veek the head feathers have emerged sufficiently for one to be able to
liscern whether they are indeed Red or Yellow-fronted (a lot of hybridiza-
ion has taken place and perhaps very few " pure " birds exist in captivity
t the moment--however this miscegenation, in most cases, is barely
vident). One interesting thing is that on the nape of the neck, in both
pecies, a faded-yellow coloured area is discernable from about the tenth
ay, disappearing, or rather becoming hidden by the green neck feathers
t the time of fledging.
The young of both species seem to spend longer in the nest than would
?em to be essential. How such active tightly spring-wound parakeets
an bide their time cooped in a box is a little perplexing, and when after
x weeks they do emerge they look as large as the parents with their
ell-grown wing and tail feathers. The bill is horn-coloured at first,
fter a w r eek it has already darkened, the bluing takes a few months longer,
exing is immediately obvious from the discrepancy in body and beak size,
he feathering over the cere is not developed until a fortnight or three
eeks after leaving the box, which makes the YYllow-fronted live up to
^ name until the red feathers emerge around the cere.
Invariably before they fledge the hen is already incubating another
utch in a second nest box. Investigations of this other site having

persisted at a low level all through sitting and brooding and feeding the
first nest, as if a daily visit marked the second box as being theirs. 1 his
philoprogenative propensity of theirs becomes a little upsetting as the
season progresses. To stop the breeding cycle one must at some point
destroy a clutch of eggs.
Before keeping New Zealand Parakeets my opinion concerning other
people's losses was that it would almost certainly turn out to be ascari-
diiasis--worms--or that such a high reproductive rate cou d lead to a
hypoproteinaemia unless a rich source of protein was made available.
I had not had the Yellow-fronted a fortnight before the hen had been
treated for concussion from having flown into the wire, and the cock bird
for an (at the time) undiagnosed severe illness which, to my surprise,
responded so well to "Aureomycin " that within a couple of days he was
his normal sprightly self. To cut a long story short, after several months
I lost the Yellow-fronted hen after a one-day illness. Autopsy showed
psittacosis, which was eventually confirmed by laboratory examination.
The very next day the Red-fronted pair became seriously ill. Fortunately
I had, immediately after diagnosing the disease, started to medicate a
drinking and bathing water with tetracycline antibiotics, which saved the
day and the birds. The psittacosis however killed several New Zealand
chicks in the nest and left the Red-fronted parents so weak that they could
not fly for a week following the inception of the disease
Psittacosis is not an uncommon disease in many widely differing
croups of birds. It is, for example, endemic in feral and domesticated
pigeons, and in most, probably all, Australian psittacines Usually the
birds live in some sort of harmony with the disease. Occasionally 1
causes the loss of young fledglings, exceptionally, unless in a virulent
form, losses in adult birds. Mostly it exists unobtrusively and totally
unsuspected. Recovered birds may become carriers. It is my opinion
that the cock Yellow-fronted contracted psittacosis from Budgerigars.
(The New Zealand Parakeets shared a shed with them for a month or so
while their aviary was made ready.) Following his treated illness he must
have become a carrier. The stress caused by simultaneously moulting
and rearing a family of very large chicks lowering his resistance and
causing him to shed the virus. While all the other New Zealands became
ill following the death of the hen he remained, apparently, perfectly
unaffected. No other of the varied species of parakeets kept in the same
block of flights showed any form of illness or sickness whatsoever, con-
tagion having jumped two flights to get to the Red-fronted, the intervening
cockatiels, rearing chicks at the time, outwardly seemingly completely
unaffected.
Conversation with other keepers of these birds who have suffered loss
leads me to believe that their losses were also probably psittacosis, ant
that at the time of their demise no other parrots seemed to be affected

If so it may be that these New Zealand parakeets have an unusual sensi-
tivity to the virus of ornithosis (psittacosis). So much so that the many
otherwise mild strains extant in several other species of birds prove fatal
when contracted by New Zealand parakeets. This idea, in the absence
of any substantial evidence, must be of course only conjectural; but as
most host species live in a delicate balance with their parasites, when a
parasite or a disease meets a new host, then its effect is likely to prove
catastrophic (myxomatosis in the rabbit, compared with its natural host
the cotton-tail rabbit, where it is a very mild disease, is an especially good
example of this).
New Zealand was a particularly isolated archipelago--very few species
of birds and no mammals, save the bats, found their way there before the
Maori and then the European invasion. It is certainly feasible that
ornithosis was unknown until introduced some time within the last
100 years, probably brought in with one of the many alien species of
birds brought over at various times to add variety to the otherwise rather
poor fauna. If so this might also explain the remarkable decline in most
native species of birds, some of which, like the New Zealand parakeets
would, on the face of it, seemed to have benefited because of the opening
up of the country.

Since the last London Zoo Notes were written John Yealland has
retired to the comparative solitude of the Isle of Wight, where we all
wish him much happiness.
Possibly the most important event at the Zoo has been the repainting
and refurbishing of the Tropical House, which was re-opened to the
public at the end of July. Three small waterfalls have been added and
provide a pleasant background of running water. There are now 16
different species in the house and the opportunity was taken when the
previous occupants were reintroduced to include four new species of
Hummingbird, including two Black-throated Mangos Anthracothorax
nigricollis which have not been in the collection for many years.
A species new to the collection is the Carmine Bee-eater Merops nubicus
and a group of five are now in the Bird House. They have settled down

extremely well, and it is proposed to build them suitable nesting sites
over the winter. Four King Penguins purchased in the spring joined the
single female which has been here since 1956. Three Alpine Choughs
were released into the Snowdon Aviary and appear to be enjoying their
extra freedom of flight. The new male Cock-of-the-Rock which now
sits in solitary splendour in the Bird House is the nominate race Rupicola
peruviana , and is a subspecies not seen in the collection before. Almost a
must for this tvpe of collection are the Crowned Pigeons and we have just
acquired two Victoria Crowned Pigeons, which we hope will bring joy
to our demanding public.
It is too earlv to say how good or bad the rearing season has been,
but certainly the Owls have done well. The most exciting event has been
the successful rearing of a single Spectacled Owl Pulsatrix p. perspicillata
which is certainly new for London, and possibly is the first time in captivity.

There is more probability of the white garden fantail having a serious effect o
the wild native woodpigeon chances of survival than the liberating of Zebra iinche
and many other species have in upsetting the balance of Nature.
P.H. Glossy Starlings were bred at liberty last season, the liberty system playm
major part in the production of robust healthy young. While mass liberation
and indiscriminate releases of non-native species must be discouraged, the keepin
of various species at liberty under the conditions practiced here, is in the interest
of aviculture. There are many more possibilities of beneficial extensions, rehabili
tations and additions to the territorial ranges of birds, than the risk of native specie
being exposed to adverse competition with new invaders. The danger of Hous
sparrow and Starling type evolutions " do exist. The introduction of certai
species could upset both Mian and Nature. M^ore than one species could b
established in the Californian fruit-growing areas, with possible disastrous result
all round. Several Asiatic and Eurasian species non-native to this country coul
be established here in the wild. However to suggest discouraging controlle
liberty breeding of selected species would be against the interests of the bird:
On the contrary, having considerations for the worldwide traffic in wild trappe
birds, every encouragement should be given to the breeding of the birds. Tab
the case of the Lavender finch, a species imported in large numbers but very rare*
bred. Research indicates aviary-bred strains of the species are likely to t
established by the controlled liberty system. Many other species could benef
from this form of culture.
Great Tits were bred for several generations under various conditions and
line reared in total confinement deteriorated rapidly while others reared by tf
liberty system maintained their stamina. Last season Blue Tits reared health
young by the liberty method. What can be done with native species applies t
foreign. At present observations are being made daily on Mistle Thrushes, Sor.
Thrushes, Blackbirds and Fieldfares all nesting under various aviary condition
(It is hoped to submit an article at the end of the season.) If a small colony &amp;lt;
Fieldfares is established, consideration will be given to liberating breeding pai
at the appropriate time. Does such action constitute a threat to the native bn
population? Not that there is any likelihood of establishing a wild breedir
stock in this country. With the Mistle Thrushes a project is under way whe
one dozen young may be bred from one pair; again the liberty system has a pa
to play. j
So many breeding successes can be attributed to the use of prolific wild stoc
and the establishing of true aviary bred strains of many species is remote und
normal aviary conditions without having to continually resort to the use
wildlings. Avicultural societies should get their priorities right and introduce
policy which encourages the establishing of aviary-bred strains of various specie
rather than only reward effort for first breedings of a species which is frequent
subsequently neglected by the breeders. In recent times Zoos without bars
developed. A system of maintaining birds in "Aviaries without netting cou
be adopted by the hobby. Visitors to the writer's garden and other establishmeri
where non-native birds are kept at controlled liberty must agree that such additio
are a desirable increase to the bird life of the area. . &apos;
So much remains to be done to establish bird protection which is truly in t
interests of the birds.

As an individual with a major responsibility for the production of the editorial
*n the liberation of non-native species I feel that it should be pointed out that the
*reeding of birds at semi-liberty or complete liberty was not overlooked and that
he comments must apply equally to this.
I am not satisfied that such a system can be adequately " controlled " and I
hink that, if widely practised, it is likely to lead to loss and release of a variety
if birds.
Unless liberty-breeding occurs in an area of complete devastation it must have
ome effect on local birds. The analogy of hantails and Woodpigeons is not a
alid one since their ecological niches differ, but when it comes to releasing smaller
irds then the only truthful answer is that we have not the slightest idea what effect
tiey are having on other species. If we release native species at semi-liberty for
reeding purposes in areas where there are wild birds of the same species we are
kel&amp;gt; to upset teriitorial boundaries and distribution and may jeopardize the
lirvival of wild broods. In addition the authorities may be a little sceptical of
le method by which an aviculturist who catches up his birds at the end of a
esting season discriminates between " his " birds and wild birds of the same age
1 the local population.
If, as is suggested, one can only breed successive generations of Great Tits under
anditions of partial liberty then this is really a statement that one cannot breed
lem as a\iary birds. It may be useful to know that a controlled liberty system
light be possible if it were vital to try it in order to ensure the survival of a species
1 danger of being lost elsewhere, but I do not think such a system should be
dvocated as an alternative to discovering how to breed birds under fully controlled
v'iary conditions.
I am personally of the opinion that a breeding achieved by allowing birds
berty at the point where they begin to require food for the young should not be
igarded as a successful aviary breeding, in the full sense of the wmrd, and that,
here awards are made, there should be some distinction between the two methods
f achieving a breeding. I also feel that if one is going to make awards for breeding,
len where a species has been first bred at semi-liberty there should be some
ibsequent recognition of the first breeding under normal aviary conditions.
As members of a society interested in birds through aviculture w r e have the
.rne responsibilities tow r ards our environment as have others whose similar
terests are expressed in other ways, and we have therefore asked a representative
the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds to give his comment on Mr.
homson's letter. C. J. O. Harrison.
j. Dawlish Avenue,
Perivale, Middlesex.
Mr. Thomson s interesting letter in the present issue of The Avicultural
magazine raises a number of somewTat controversial points.
Recently in biological and conservation circles the subject of introductions of
&amp;gt;n-nati\e species has been much discussed. There is a large measure of agree-
ent that non-native species should not be introduced whether they are plant or
iimal, and that reintroductions of (extinct) native species should only be under-
en where it can be shown that the experiment would be of scientific interest
d that the ecological conditions were suitable for the organisms' survival.
I feel most strongly so far as Britain's avifauna is concerned that it would be
plorable if it were to be contaminated by the introduction of non-native species
liberty breeding. One cannot see with any certainty that a species which is
ing liberty bred will not disperse, begin to breed freely and ultimately spread
er the country. The whole history of the appearance of new species of birds
the faunas of various continents sprinkles with examples to show that
-scaped birds or animals have spread to become a menace or at least a nuisance
the native fauna, or to the various aspects of human interests. I would maintain
^strongly that the utmost care must be taken to ensure that foreign birds do not
abash themselves outside an aviary.
Those of us who are concerned about the native fauna of this country do not find
roduced species a pleasure and most of the organizations concerned w&apos;ould,
ink, deplore the reintroduction of such species as the Fieldfare, particularly
ien there are signs of this species beginning to recolonize Shetland by natural

means. Mr. Thomson asks whether the introduction of the Fieldfare would
create a threat to the native fauna. The Fieldfare might not, but many other
species could, and each individual case must be considered on its own merits.
In addition, introductions of the kind mentioned by Mr. Thomson would vitiate
years of study by students of the movement of bird populations; if every aviculturist
took it into his head to release or establish colonies outside their normal breeding
range, chaos would ensue.
Mr. Thomson confuses the issues when talking about zoos without bars. It is
true that some zoos have no iron bars, but inmates are still confined. If one could
confine birds to an area, thus preventing them spreading, without the use of
netting, there might be no objection. Peter Conder, Director.

THE LONGEVITY OF PARROTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991853086956522" page_id="58089619"  page_num="198" year="" vol="">
Parrots are popularly supposed to live for a hundred years or more--a suppo-
sition fostered by grossly exaggerated claims made in regard to unfortunate birds
exhibited at fairs and seaside shows.
Pet dealers extolling their stock frequently tell prospective customers that the life
expectancy of a parrot or cockatoo may reasonably be regarded as similar to their
own. There are, of course, records of such birds living to a great age, but they have
necessarily had several owners and it is this handing down that is responsible
for many inaccuracies. In addition, none has been bred in captivity and here
again a certain amount of guesswork is involved. Ages of 30 or 40 years are
quite exceptional and very few indeed die of genuine old age.
There are accounts of birds such as the Macaw (? species) living in Venice in
1900, suoposed to be 136 years old. It is said to have originally been the property
of Charles IV of Spain who died in the early 1800's. It was then in the ownership
of the King's grandson--the so-called Duke of Madrid.
Then there was " Cocky Bennett ", a Sulphur-crested Cockatoo, that died in
Canterbury, near Sydney, in May, 1916, at the reputed age of 119 years. " Cocky "
was for many years in the possession of Mrs. Sarah Bennett, licensee of the Sea
Breeze Hotel, at Tom Ugly's Point. Judging by a photograph of the stuffed
remains " Cocky " was indeed a Methuselah amongst cockatoos. It was prac-
tically featherless for the last 20 years of its life, with the upper mandible
overgrown to such an extent that it almost touched its breast.
Dr. W. C. Osman Hill has recorded three cases of longevity of Blue-fronted
Amazons, presumably based on birds sent to the Zoological Society of London foi

her possession for 49 years and was said to be eighteen months old on receipt
It died on 21st October, 1950, presumably over 50 years old.
2. A male kept by its last owner for 14 years and by the previous ownei
for 42 years; before that it had been in the same family for 37 years. Ir.
1944 the owner had published a note in The Star giving its age at that datf
as 87. It died in April, 1954, at the reputed age of 97 years.
3. A female that had been in the possession of three owners, 9# years, 19 years
and 70 years. When it died in July, i 954 &amp;gt; if the history is reliable, it musi
have been a centenarian.
Dr. Osman Hill also mentions a Greater Sulphur-crested Cockatoo of 51 years
and another of the same species as being accidentally killed after 109 years ir
captivity. And a traditional record of 137 years and 10 months for the samt
species (Avicultural Magazine, 1951, 36; 1954, 165).
And in 1954 there was a Red and Yellow Macaw in the Adelaide Zoo, believed tc
have been in the possession of the Royal Zoological Society of Australia for at leas&apos;
75 years. . . ,
It would be of interest if readers were to record any cases of longevity with whicr
they are personally acquainted. A. A. Prestwich.

Three score, ten and five years, three-quarters of a century, seventy-five
years describe the period how you will--it is quite long by any standard.
Despite many forebodings the Society has managed to thrive and today
it may truly be said to be in a stronger position than at any time in its
history, and the Avicultural Magazine has a world-wide circulation.
But this satisfactory state of affairs is undoubtedly due to those early
pioneers in aviculture at the turn of the century, who placed the Society
on such solid foundations and who from the first established a high
standard for its journal--the Avicultural Magazine.
In the following pages an exact reproduction of parts of the first
lumber of the Magazine, published in November 1894, are given, including
:he statement of aims and objects, rules, list of officers, committee, and
nembers together with a specimen of the advertisements which appeared
n this number. Notes by the Secretary and Treasurer, with slight
iterations, are as applicable today as they were 75 years ago!
An article " On Aviculture in Aviaries " by Arthur G. Butler and
he first of a series of articles on " Our Bird-Rooms and Aviaries " which
:ommenced in this number, contributed by Reginald Phillipps and entitled
My Bird-Room ", are also included.
The first colour-plate, reproduced as the frontispiece of this special
upplement was not attained till the third volume, published in 1896.
rhe accompanying article by A. G. Butler on the Pine Grosbeak was the
rst of a series on the Fringillinae.

On its foundation it was expected that the Society would be " kept
together by the penny post ". But that lowly charge has long since
vanished and while the Society is, of course, still reliant on the Magazine
it does now have an advantage in the British Aviculturists' Club. The
Society has had a very great past and it is to be fervently hoped that
Members will never lose their sense of gratitude.
The Society prides itself on being international in character, and
reference to the List of Members shows that there are in fact Members
throughout the world. Scattered though they are it is perhaps difficult for
some to remember they are members of a society , and not just subscribers to
a publication; and as such they are asked to do everything possible to
further its interests.
It has been said that a society is only as good as its members. If true,,
our Society is paramount. With your co-operation we can keep it that
way.

One of our chief objects will be to endeavour;to bridge over the gulf
which exists between the lover of live birds and the v scientific ornithologist
--we believe that each has much to learn from the other. We want to infuse
a little science into the bird-keeper, and to interest the cabinet ornithologist
in the habits of birds.
A word as to our name. It seems desirable and even necessary, to
invent or acclimatize a word which shall denote " a person interested in the
keeping, and breeding of birds," and Aviculturist (being analogous to
Horticulturist) will do perhaps as well as another. If any one will suggest
a better, we shall be glad to adopt it--till then, we beg to subscribe our-
selves Avicui/turists.
We relv for the success of the Society upon the energy of the
members in inducing others to join, and in contributing to the Maga-
zine. Those who are not prepared to write a formal article have
generally met with some little facts or fancies in their avicultural experience,
which will be of interest to others, and if they will note these down and
send them to the Secretary, thev will place the rest of the Society under an
obligation. We want the benefit of the practical' experience of all--we
neither expedt nor want literary skill.
In order that the Society may be of real assistance to beginners, we have
arranged to give advice to members upon all matters relating to aviculture
bv Post. The vexatious delay which arises when correspondents are only
answered in the columns of a magazine or newspaper will thus be avoided.
All letters and questions must be sent to the Secretary, and contain a stanipea
envelope for reply. The Secretary will forward the letters to those Members
of the Committee who are best qualified to deal with the subjects to which
they relate, and who are willing to undertake the task of replying to questions.
For the present, questions relating to Parrots will generally be replied to by
Mr. Camps or Dr. Simpson ; Insectivorous Foreign Birds will be undertaken
by Mr. Phillipps or Dr. Simpson ; Foreign Finches, by Dr. Butler or Mr.
Fillmer; and British Birds by Mr. Frostick or Mr. Swaysland. fhose
questions and answers which appear to be of general interest, will be
published in the Magazine.
Dr. Simpson regrets that he cannot undertake post mortem examina-
tions of birds, audit is particularly requested that&apos;.bodies of birds be not
sent either to him or to any of the other officers of the Society. We
should be glad to hear from any member willing to undertake post mortems.
It has been suggested that a sale and exchange column should
be opened, and we are prepared to admit advertisements of birds at
the rate of* 3d. for each insertion, of not more than two lines. Longer
advertisements will be charged in proportion. Advertisements of " wants
will be inserted free of charge. It is hoped that this'arrangement will prove
of mutual advantage to our members, who will thus know with whom they
are dealing. We do not.pretend to be exclusive; but we believe that under
our rules (which have been very carefully thought out, and will be vigilantly
administered), it will not be possible for any but honourable and straight-
forward men and women to become members of the Avicultural
Society.

The Secretary hopes that every member will assist him in making the
Magazine a success by sending notes or short articles on Aviculture from
time to time. It is intended to publish an account of the various bird-
rooms and aviaries belonging to the members, under the title of " Our
Bird Rooms and Aviaries.'&apos; Mr. Pliillipps has earned the thanks of the
Society by his most valuable contribution to this series. Will each member
follow his example ? Another series on " Rare Foreign Birds," to which
Mr. Fillmer this month contributes "The Parrot Finch," and " The Black-
tailed Hawfinch," it is believed will be of great interest, if all will help
by sending notes on the rare species they have kept. Will those who live
in the country communicate their observations on wild bird life ? And will
our more scientific friends enlighten us on those points of ornithology which
bear upon practical Aviculture. Lastly, will those who do not feel able to
do anything else ask questions ?

NOTE BY THE TREASURER-
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.953088590909091" page_id="58089641"  page_num="204" year="" vol="">
I shall be much obliged if those members who have not yet paid
their subscriptions, will kindly remit them to me in the course of the next
few weeks.
I have promised that the necessary funds shall be forthcoming for
the printing and circulating of our Magazine for one year, and that the
Society shall start upon its second year free from debt; after October, 1895,
the Society must be self-supporting if it is to continue to exist. I
calculate that if we can secure a membership of from 140 to 150, the success
of the Society is assured, and there will be 110 deficit for me to make up at
the end of the year. It will be seen that we start with 52 members ; we
want therefore 100 new ones, and I appeal to all to do their utmost to
increase our numbers. If we have a large membership we shall be able to
have a large Magazine, and .shall be in a position to extend our cause in
various other ways. But if our list of members remains small, we cannot
afford to print more than eight pages per month, and shall be prevented
from extending the usefulness of the Society by other means.
I shall not be satisfied until we number 200.
Members who wish for extra copies of this first number for distri-
bution amongst their friends, can have them on application, at one penny
per copy. This charge is merely made to cover postage.

By Arthur G. Butler, Ph.D., F.L.S., etc.
The study of birds in aviaries (I am not speaking of flight cages, but
such as are large enough for the owners to walk about in) is in many
respects far more satisfactory than when they are confined even in large
cages. Of this fact I can speak from experience; because, when I com-
menced to keep birds, my space was limited; so that my largest " aviary "
was then actually little more than a long flight cage, only two feet six in
height and one foot four inches from front to back: in length, this cage
was not so bad about ten feet; but nevertheless, for breeding purposes, it
was of little practical use, on account of its narrowness, which brought the
birds too close to the observer.
When my present house was built, I had seven aviaries constructed,
all of them under cover: of these, four are kept at a moderately warm
temperature during the winter; the other three are unheated. I have now
added two open garden aviaries, with a door of communication from one
to the other, and each of them measuring eleven feet six inches in length,
four feet six inches from front to back, and from about seven to eight feet
in height (the roof sloping forwards). At first, my unheated aviaries were
permanently open on one side to the air, throughout the year; but the
through draught caused, when the door in my garden was opened, proved
very prejudicial to the health of some of the birds, more especially to
British species, such as Linnets, Goldfinches and Siskins; therefore, I
eventually had sashes made (which could at any time be removed) so as to
exclude draught.
To attain much success in breeding, each aviary should be plentifully
supplied with various forms of receptacles for nests, and when possible
these should be more or less concealed by thick bushes: dead furze-bushes
perhaps make the best cover; but if these are not procurable, branches of
fir answer the purpose fairly well. Pea sticks nailed against the walls
make convenient elastic perches, and when used in quantity, help a little
to conceal the roughness of nest-boxes.
In the case of the well-known receptacle described by Herr Wiener, as
of the cigar-box pattern, it is always best to give the builders a start by
ramming two or three handfuls of hay into the bottom before hanging it
up: the actual nest is then much more easily and rapidly completed, than
when the architects have first to form their own foundation; while the
appearance of nesting-material in the box gives the birds a hint as to what
is expected of them.
From a study of the works of Dr. Russ, I am convinced that when
many birds of different species are kept in the same aviary, it is necessary

to supply a considerable amount of cover in order to ensure the production
of many broods. My own experience has shown me that where it is
impossible to do this, the different architects are constantly at warfare,
consequently, though many and varying nests are built throughout the
year, few, if any, broods come to perfection. This, I believe, is the reason
why my Ornamental-finch aviary, which only has one short wall available
for nesting-purposes, so rarely proves productive; whereas the adjoining
Weaver aviary, having a twelve-foot length of additional wall, gives fairly
satisfactory results.
The amateur who has only observed Ornamental-finches in store or
flight-cages would be apt to imagine that they were, as a class, the most
amiable and peaceable of birds; there they sit in rows close together,
preening each others feathers and lovingly caressing one another: but in
the aviary all this is changed, and especially when more than a pair of each
species is turned loose. Now disputes are frequent, more particularly when
nesting is commenced, and in the case of some of the species, not
infrequently with fatal effect.
An Ornamental-finch aviary should not only be restricted to small
Fringilloid birds, but it should exclude Aurora, Diamond, Parson, and
Ribbon-finches, more particularly the two last-mentioned, which are both
meddlesome and murderous towards smaller or weaker birds. Then again,
(but here I am preaching that which, at present, I do not practice), a
Weaver-aviary ought not to include Bayas or soft-billed birds, some of
which are very destructive both to eggs and newly-hatched youngsters.
During the present year my two Bayas and a Yellow-bellied Leiothrix
(Pekin Nightingale) have, I know, greatly reduced the numbers of my
additions: but when I kept Blue-birds with Ornamental-finches, every egg
was stolen, almost as soon as it made its appearance in a nest.
Next year I hope to try an interesting experiment with my garden
aviaries: it is my intention, as soon as the warm weather commences, to
turn out pairs of two species into each aviary, with ample nesting accom-
modation and plenty of cover. I believe that, under these favourable
conditions, far better results may be anticipated, than when thirty or forty
examples of different species are associated together.
If supplied with plenty of suitable food, I think that many birds
which are usually considered unable to stand cold, become perfectly hardy
under this apparently adverse state of things. As an instance, I may
mention that, in about August or September of 1893, I turned loose a
Redstart into one of my unheated aviaries. Now, in the article on British
birds in Cassell's " Cage-birds ", Mr. Swaysland mentions one that was
kept from April to December, but which always felt the cold when the
thermometer fell to 40*, and in November the cold weather sent it into a
decline, of which it died. This bird, however, was fed partly on raw meat,
and meal-worms appear to have constituted its insect-food. Fortunately for
my birds I have a goodly number of Cockroaches in my bird-room and

stoke-hole: every night three " demon beetle-traps " are put down; and
each morning, summer and winter, these are transferred to my aviaries'
where they are soon cleared out by the birds.
Last winter, on a diet of bread, potato, grocer's currants, egg, ants'
e gg s &amp;gt; Abrahams food and cockroaches (with an occasional spider) my
Redstart, a Blackcap, a Whinchat, a Yellow and a Grey Wagtail, together
with several foreign seed-eating birds, were quite indifferent to twelve
degrees of frost. All these birds, excepting the Blackcap, which was killed
by a Blossom-headed Parrakeet, are in perfect condition at the present
time; and, so far as I can see, likely to live through the coming winter
equally well.
Perhaps I may be prejudiced, if so, my prejudice is based upon very
unpleasant experience; but I believe that raw meat is extremely unsuitable
food for any but predacious birds. I have kept Thrushes and Blackbirds in
perfect health for years without a particle of raw meat, and it is absolutely
certain that a Missel-Thrush brought up and always fed upon farinaceous
food, was killed at the Crystal Palace through having scraped raw meat
and bread supplied to it; previous to that time it had never had a day's
illness, but was a marvel of vivacity, tameness and cleanliness.
In. the breeding-season two cock Wagtails, of different species,
invariably fight in an aviary; and unless separated, the stronger (not
always the larger) will infallibly starve the weaker to death, by incessantly
driving him from the food-dishes. I even lost a favourite hen Grey
Wagtail two or three years ago, owing to the persecutions of a male Pied
Wagtail. This summer again, I was obliged to remove my Yellow Wagtail
to a cage to prevent his destroying a very beautiful cock Grey Wagtail. At
the Zoological Gardens the Grey and Pied Wagtails have been successfully
crossed: probably the hen bird was the Pied; if not, the male bird must
have been an especially amiable individual.
My experience of British birds as aviary pets leads me to the following
conclusions:--All finches must either be kept in a large open garden
aviary, as nearly as possible under the same conditions to which they
would be subject when at large; or, they must be kept during the winter
at a high temperature, indoors. They are far more susceptible to changes
of temperature when in captivity than the majority of foreign finches.
It is rare for Goldfinches, Bullfinches, Linnets, and especially Siskins,
to live in a limited, unheated, though enclosed, aviary for more than
eighteen months. Indeed I have found some of the small Indian, Austra-
lian, and even African and South American Ornamental-finches, decidedly
more hardy under these conditions.
On the other hand, many Insectivorous British birds appear to be
ndifferent to temperature provided that they can be supplied with a fair
quantity of insect-food throughout the year.
Budgerigars seem to be subject to the same influences as British
inches, they will stand cold well, but not in a covered-in aviary: yet in a

flight-cage open only in front, and kept at a moderate temperature, they
live for years. Blossom-headed Parrakeets, on the other hand, have so far
done well in the same aviary which killed the majority of my Budgerigars:
indeed, whereas twelve out of thirteen young birds of the latter species
died within two or three months after leaving the nest, a young male
Blossom-head, born this year in the same log-nest, is larger and apparently
more vigorous than its parents.
The preceding observations must, nevertheless, be understood generally;
not as applying to every individual of a species: thus, for several years
I repeatedly tried to keep the Cordon Bleu in my Ornamental-finch aviary;
but always lost every individual, either within a few weeks or at best in two
or three months. At length, I purchased two pairs, in 1892, and turned one
pair into the same aviary, the other into a flight-cage; the hen of the first
pair lived about three months, that in the cage a little over a year; but
both cock-birds are in perfect health as I write, having passed through
two winters, at a temperature never lower than 46 degrees Fahr., but rarely
exceeding 50 degrees.
It has been frequently stated that, in flight-cages, the Amaduvade
Waxbills, as well as Cordon Bleus, are liable to baldness. This is, without
question, due to the fact that the birds pull out one another's feathers; a
trick to which the Green Amaduvade is much addicted. In a large aviary,
on the contrary, all these birds are usually in magnificent feather; though
in the case of Stictospiza formosa , a spiteful unpaired hen will sometimes
make herself objectionable by pulling out her companions' feathers; or
specimens which have long been naturalized in the aviary will simul-
taneously surround and pluck a new-comer, more especially when the
latter is somewhat rough in plumage. For this reason, as well as from the
inexplicable fact that, after several years of uninterrupted health, these
lovely little birds will suddenly and unaccountably be found dead (though
subsequent dissection shows all their organs apparently healthy) the Green
Avadavats, or Amaduvades, are somewhat aggravating aviary pets. Mr.
Abrahams considers them delicate; but I think this is not the real cause of
their death: a bird which can stand twelve degrees of frost and be none
the worse, can hardly be strictly called delicate. My own opinion is that
these birds usually die of apoplexy, or heart disease, suddenly; that a
scare, caused by the hasty entry of any person into the bird-room, or the
abrupt turning on of artificial light, may be accountable.
If these few rough notes should prove useful to any of our members,
they will have served their purpose; and such matters as I may have over-
looked, will, I hope, be supplemented by others who have had experience
of this form of Aviculture. On the other hand, should anyone wish for
further information on any of the points which I have mentioned, it will
be a pleasure to me to attempt to answer such questions as he may put.
What all aviarists desire is, to render their feathered pets as nearly as

possible immortal; but perhaps when I say all , I should exclude bird-
dealers, who doubtless would be content with a more moderate span of life
for them. At present, aviculture is still in its infancy, and every crumb of
information based upon fact is important. A Society such as ours, which
affords its members the opportunity of freely exchanging experiences, is
therefore likely to prove extremely useful, in reducing the death-rate of
birds in captivity.

Most of us are the victims of circumstances; and most of those who, like
myself, love their birds, would like to provide better accommodation for
them than circumstances will usually permit. Besides, we all have our
own peculiar idea of what is right and what is best; and some of us keep one
class of bird, some another. It follows of necessity, therefore, that bird-
rooms are of all sorts and sizes, and arranged in many different ways; and
doubtless we may all pick up a wrinkle or two by reading accounts of the
homes in which our fellow aviarists keep their feathered pets.
Some people seem to consider that a bird-room is a room in which to
place cages containing birds; and there are some who--the victims of
circumstances, you know--find it difficult to keep their birds except in
cages. The room is fitted up with shelves, and on the shelves are placed
:he cages, and in the cages are placed the birds, all much like a bird-shop,
3r, to put it more prettily, like the Parrot House at the London Zoological
wardens. The habits of caged birds may be studied in such a room, but
lot the habits of birds. If you desire to study the habits of your favourites,
md to find out what are their respective natures, why birds have been con-
structed by the Master Builder some in one way, some in another, and all
10 marvellously according to their several requirements, you must let them
lave as much liberty as possible. If you have not an out-door aviary, have
me made; if you are likewise a victim, and cannot do so, at any rate let
mur birds fly loose in your bird-room, as far as practicable.
When selecting a room for your birds, choose, if you can, a lofty room,
acing south or thereabouts, on the ground floor, with the window opening
m to the private garden. There are several advantages in having the bird-
oom on the ground floor. The temperature is more equable than if it be

somewhere among the garrets; the birds are more handy during your
waking hours; you are less likely to stir up the ire (always latent, if not
always expressed) of the petticoated members of the household, as you will
avoid making a mess about the house, and being accused of wearing out
the stair-carpet by your " perpetual tramping up and down after those
nasty things "; and above all you may be tempted to do what I have done
--to build an aviary in the garden coming up to and against the house, and
so arranged that you can let your birds fly backwards and forwards between
the bird-room and the aviary, just as you may deem prudent or find
convenient.
Your bird-room must (I prefer must to ought) have a fire-place, to assist
the ventilation; and, in my room, at the very top of the wall, I have had a
good-sized hole knocked through into the chimney, protected by a grating.
A wire-guard protects the fire-place, and prevents any bird going up the
chimney, or sitting on the cold bars in a very draughty place. The window
is protected by wire-netting: I have two light wooden frames covered with
netting, the one fitted over the upper half of the window, the other over the
lower; either of these can be easily removed, to allow the birds egress and
ingress; or, when left in position, the window can be opened without allow-
ing the escape of the inmates. The window, moreover, can be opened and
closed from the outside, without entering the bird-room.
The room should be as light as possible, but should be provided with a
dark blind; this latter is of great value when you desire to catch a bird, one
person trimming the blind, while you catch your bird without any bustle.
I still have a blind; but, since I have introduced some of the larger parra-
keets into the family, it has fared rather badly. The walls are washed, not
papered; and, if you may (I may not), you will do well to cut a panel or two
out of the door, and cover the apertures with netting; the apertures serve
not only as peep-holes, but also as aids to ventilation. If too draughty or
cold, a piece of green baize, or other covering, can be arranged to fall down
over them as required.
The question of the floor and its covering is a very serious one. If you
have tiny finches, waxbills, and the like, I suppose there is nothing better
than a good layer of sand. This has the disadvantage, however, of
clinging to one's feet as one leaves the room, with the unavoidable conse-
quences that more is carried away and deposited elsewhere than the ruling
powers usually approve of. Not long since I met a gentleman who is very
warm on the canary. I have never seen his bird-room, but, like that of
most fancy canary breeders, doubtless it contains only caged birds. As he
piteously remarked, it is impossible to help a little seed-husk getting about,
or a little dirt of some kind sticking to one's slippers; but he said that he is
regarded among his own household as an outcast, and a-, and is
treated accordingly. Nevertheless, I am glad to say that he has nailed his
colours to the mast, and has no intentions of surrendering. If the man
without sand on his floor is treated thus, how will it fare with the one who

sands his floor properly! A little while back, someone writing to the
papers told us how it ought to be done. He commenced by letting his
birds fly loose in the room; but, after having been taught the errors of his
ways, he shut them up in cages, seated himself comfortably in the centre of
the room, lighted his pipe, and was able to view his feathered prisoners
with a quiet mind, and amidst that domestic harmony which should prevail
even in the house of an aviculturist. To my mind, this was retrogression,
not progression. He evidently had not the same grit in him as has our
canary friend.
But I am wandering. I do not have sand on the floor of my bird-room.
Most of the birds I have kept for these many years have been large ones;
and for such a sandy floor would probably be a mistake. I have one piece
of floor-cloth running the whole length of the room, and 9 ft. wide--the
widest I could obtain: this covers a very large part of the floor. A nurse-
girl comes six days a week to attend to my feathered children; and one of
her duties is to clean the floor every day. This plan has many advantages
and many disadvantages; but with large birds I doubt if it is not as good as
any other.
My ideas of cages are perhaps peculiar. The ordinary cage is sometimes
useful, sometimes, perhaps, almost necessary; but I do not favour it. All
the cages in my bird-room have been specially made according to my own
directions, some of them I now know are not quite as they should be; but
they still answer the purpose very well, better than would any I could
obtain ready made. Two are slightly over 4 ft. x 2 ft. x 5! ft. high.
The more modern ones are from 4 ft. to 6 ft. long, about 2 ft. deep, and
from 2 ft. to 3 ft. high. One is placed at the top of another, the upper
ones having gable roofs. Most of them can be divided into two or into
tee sections, 2 ft. long each, by running in divisions, should it be neces-
sary. All the doors of these cages last mentioned are about 2 ft. x 2 ft.,
vith an extra door of the same size for the longer cages, so that one side can
3e thrown open; and wide open these doors usually are, for they are closed
mly when a bird is encaged for some special reason. The bottoms of all
he cages are kept well supplied with sand, grit, cuttle-bone, rock salt, egg-
shells (baked and ground), and finely ground oyster shell. Some of the
:ages have been fitted up with little shelves, on which are placed most of
he food saucers and drinking w^ater, so that both are kept free from
hoppings. The cages are mostly set on stands, which raise them at least
&amp;gt;ne foot above the floor; and there is a space of several inches between the
ages and the w r all. I consider these last-named arrangements to be of
pecial value. Mice cannot climb into the cages and disturb the inmates,
ior soil the food; and cockroaches have to content themselves with such
craps of food as may happen to have been scattered on to the floor,
doreover, if a bird should fall down behind the cages, instead of getting
LXe d and dying miserably, it lands on the floor, hops quietly forth from
nder the cages, and is itself again; and the open space beneath and behind

the cages tends to cleanliness and pure air. Each cage should have at least
two sides of wood, the remainder being built round with straight wire, not
wire-netting. About the room, but not coming too near the window, nor
over that part of the floor which is uncovered--and which is usually clean,
and forms my customary path--there are several natural boughs of various
sizes, and portions of trees, fixed about, artificial perches being mostly
excluded. There are usually, also, a few nesting boxes about; but I trust
more to the aviary for all nesting purposes, the bird-room being used more
as a shelter from cold and wet. But, of course, with many kinds of birds
totally different arrangements would have to be made; and in my bird-
room and aviary there is a quiet work of change perpetually going on,
according to the natures and requirements of my various pets.
I have never been able to detect a bird-insect of any kind in the bird-
room itself, notwithstanding that some of the cages, or houses, are old,
with ample accommodation for millions of mites. I smear the parts where
cages rest on one another and on the stands thickly with soft soap as bought;
it is the duty of the nurse to constantly well rub over every part of every
cage with a damp cloth; and occasionally I personally doctor any cage that
I think may be likely to require it with a liberal supply of fir-tree oil. At
night I sometimes make a tour of inspection with a candle, to see if any
traces of the prowling foe can be discovered. In short, I go in for clean-
liness and prevention; and the results are certainly satisfactory so far as the
absence of mite and disease is concerned. The floor and floor-cloth are
washed every week-day with carbolic soap; and every drop of water used
for cleansing purposes is fortified with permanganate of potash. The
room is over the kitchen, and the kitchen flues run up the wall by the side of
the fire-place, and make the room very dry, so that the moisture is rather
beneficial than otherwise. In another room, this daily floor-washing
might not be wise. Certainly my birds never seem to suffer from this
cause: I have invariably been able to trace every case of cold, and the like,
to over exposure out of doors. The food and water vessels are scattered
far and wide, so that every bird may have a chance; none of the vessels
are of metal; and the washing saucer is placed on the floor, on a large tray.
A thermometer reports the temperature, and the lowest degree of cold
touched during the night.
For a good part of the year, I keep a hurricane lamp burning in the
bird-room all through the night. This practice has much to be said in its
favour. I am in London, and am shut in by houses, and the bird-room is
dark; and the evenings so rapidly close in on a dull day that my birds used
often to go to roost before their supper was served: for fresh food for the
Soft Bills, and fresh water, are always given at least twice every day. Nov
they have grown accustomed to the light, most of them will feed to a much
later hour than they were able to do formerly; and they can get to then
food betimes in the morning, fog or no fog. And the lamp is invaluable ir
a room where migratory birds are kept. Instead of knocking themselves

about, and knocking other birds off their perches, as they used to do, they
now fly round and round the room until they have had enough of it, and
then quietly compose themselves to sleep as if nothing had happened; and
by the time I go to bed everything is quiet. Of course, I burn a much
stronger light, two lamps in fact, during the earlier part of the dark
evenings, a much softer light prevailing during the night. A panic in a
bird-room in which there is a light is a very unlikely occurrence, and even
if such a thing should happen little or no mischief would befall the inmates.
I do not believe in the wisdom of keeping delicate Foreign birds through
an English winter without artificial heat. I am well aware that many
foreign birds can stand a great deal of cold; but not many of them can do
so with impunity, although the effects may not immediately be apparent.
The longer I keep birds, the more I believe in the wisdom of keeping them
warm, dry, and comfortable. For some years, I warmed my bird-room
with a gas fire; but the expense was so considerable that the gas had to give
way to the less convenient, but less costly, paraffin. I place a paraffin
stove between the window and the fire-place, and near to the latter, cover it
with a wire extinguisher-like guard: and on the top of the latter I place a
pan of water for evaporation purposes. The lamp, also, lends its help in
warming the room. But I must again press upon you the importance of
having the room well ventilated, but without draughts, especially during
the winter months.
If all the cages be mounted on stands as I have suggested, mice cannot do
much harm. Nevertheless, they are highly objectionable tenants, and
should be evicted or otherwise disposed of. Traps will catch a few, now
and then, but are practically of no use. I allow one hole to be always
open, their favourite hole. Down this I drop a piece of bread and butter,
well smeared over with phosphor paste, taking great care that none of the
paste is left outside. The mice disappear: sometimes a feeble outbreak of
the attack takes place in a month or two, but a second dose frees me of
them for from twelve to eighteen months. On the morning following the
laying down of the poison, I promptly remove any dead mice I may find;
and those which die beneath the flooring seem to dry up, and do not smell!
I once found such an one, as perfect and dry as a mummy.
In some particulars, I have not described my bird-room just as it is, but
rather as it should be, so that this little sketch of it may be the more useful
to my readers. But they will please bear in mind that circumstances alter
cases, and that what is best for one room may not be the best in another;
and that a different class of birds may require various modifications of
various details.

Since publication of the first number of the Magazine in November,
1894, there have been fourteen Editors and co-Editors. Through every
possible vicissitude during the past seventy-five years they have managed
to produce the Magazine without a break--a Magazine of ever-increasing
stature, unrivalled in its field.
Members have every reason to feel grateful to the Society's fifty-two
Original Members, especially to those who first took office and got the
Society under way. Unfortunately, with the passing of time, the majority
have been forgotten, even their names being known to but few.
It is the present intention to remind Members, by way of brief bio-
graphies, of Editors down the years. Limited space prevents anything
but the briefest notice. In a few cases little noteworthy is discoverable
and in others it has not been possible to trace photographs.
Dr. C. S. Simpson
Original Member. Hon. Editor, 1894-1896 (with H. R. Fillmer):
Hon. Secretary, 1894-1896.
Dr. Charles S. Simpson was in medical practice in Brighton and, with
his friend H. R. Fillmer, edited the first two volumes of the Magazine.
He was an ardent supporter and on the Council, of the Cage Bird Club,
and a Member of the United Kingdom Foreign Cage Bird Society--
forerunners of the Society. He in no way left his mark as an aviculturist
but he was a keen exhibitor and judged at the Crystal Palace Show. His
main interest seems to have been parrakeets. Very definitely one of the
principal founders of the Society.
H. R. Fillmer
Original Member. Hon. Editor, 1894-1896 (with Dr. C. S. Simpson);
1896-1899: Hon. Secretary, 1896-1899: Hon. Treasurer, 1894-1897:
Vice-President, 1925-1942.
Horatio Rutter Fillmer died at Hassocks, Sussex, on 23rd February,
1942, at the age of 79. He was formerly a solicitor practicing in Brighton.
Fillmer was a staunch supporter of the Cage Bird Club and of the
United Kingdom Foreign Cage Bird Society. He has been described as
the " mainspring " of the Society during its formative years--a description
with which few would disagree. He does, however, seem to have been
something of a weathercock.
In 1901 the Society and its Magazine were at a pretty low level, and it
was then that Fillmer severed his connection with the Society and
resuscitated the Foreign Bird Exhibitors' League as the Foreign Bird
Club. He acted as Secretary-Treasurer and Editor of its new magazine
Bird Notes. Fillmer stipulated that there should be no competition
between the two magazines, but to an extent this was inevitable.

By the end of 1903, mainly due to the efforts of Seth-Smith, the Society
was again in the ascendant and it was then that Fillmer applied for
readmission to Membership. A year or so later he resigned as Editor of
Bird Notes and thereafter took little part in the affairs of the Society or
Club, but as he was a Vice-President of the latter he automatically
continued as such on the amalgamation in 1925.
Fillmer was a specialist in the smaller, seed-eating foreign cage-birds,
and was the author of an informative booklet " Waxbills, Grass-finches and
Mannikins ", 1897. He also wrote under the name " Septimus Perkins

much of his time to natural history, especially ornithology. At the end
of 1907 he went to Australia on behalf of the Zoological Society of London
and the following year he was presented with the Zoological Society's
Silver Medal " in recognition of his services in making and bringing home
the Society's Collection of Australian Fauna, 1908 ". This collecting
trip is described in Notes on a Naturalist&apos;s Visit to Australia , 1910.
Then began David Seth-Smith's long association with the London Zoo.
He was Inspector of Works, combined with Curator of Birds, from 1909
until 1923, when he became Curator of Mammals and Birds, retiring in

Previous to taking up his duties with the Zoological Society he achieved
some notable breeding successes and was awarded the Avicultural Society's
Medal on seven occasions: Cape Sparrow (1901), Greater Button Quail
( I 9 * 3 )&amp;gt; Brush Bronze-winged Pigeon (1904), Scaly Dove (1904), Tataupa
Finamou (1904), Variegated Bustard Quail (1905) and Australian Swamp
Quail (1905).
David Seth-Smith was untiring in his efforts to make the Society a
success and could always be relied on to act as a stop-gap in any emergency.

The present compiler is particularly grateful to him as he acted as Chair-
man of the British Aviculturists' Club on its foundation in 1946, and
on some twenty subsequent occasions.
David Seth-Smith, " Zoo Man " of the B.B.C.'s Children's Hour, was
loved and admired by many millions of children and grown-ups alike for
his friendly, weekly broadcasts before the war.
He was the author of the classic " Parrakeets ", published in six parts,
1902--1903 (brought up to date by the addition of an appendix, 1926), and
several popular books on the natural history of mammals and birds.
Dr. A. G. Butler
Original Member. Hon. Editor, 1907-1908 (with D. Seth-Smith):
Hon. Secretary, 1903-1904 (with R. Phillipps); 1904-1909 (with T. H.
Newman); 1909-1914 (with R. I. Pocock); 1914-1916 (with T. H.
Newman); 1916-1919 (with Miss R. Alderson); 1919-1920 (with Dr. L.
Lovell-Keays).
Dr. Arthur Gardiner Butler was born at Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, on
27th June, 1844, and died at Beckenham, Kent, on 28th May, 1925, at the
age of 80.
Dr. Butler entered the service of the Trustees of the British Museum,
as a systematic entomologist, in 1863. He was appointed Assistant Keeper
of Insects in 1879, a post which he held until his retirement in 1901, after
thirty-eight years' service. His special charge was the Arthropoda.
Dr. Butler was extremely interested in birds but as his duties at the
Museum prevented his studying them in the field he took up aviculture,
with some success. He was awarded the Society s Medal for breeding
the Tambourine Dove (1906).
In addition to numerous publications on entomology Dr. Butler was the
author of about a dozen books on birds. Some of the best known are:
" Foreign Finches in Captivity ", 2 vols, 1894 (2nd ed., 1899); " British
Birds with their Nests and Eggs ", 6 vols, 1896-1898; " How to Sex
Cage-birds ", 1907; and " Foreign Birds for Cage and Aviary ", 2 vols:
1910.

Frank Finn was born in Maidstone in 1868 and died in London or
1st October, 1932.
In 1892 Frank Finn made a collecting expedition to Zanzibar anc
Mombasa, returning with a good collection of birds for the Londor
Zoological Gardens. In 1894 he joined the staff of the Indian Museum
Calcutta; Deputy Superintendent, 1895-1902. While in India he made ;
special study of the relationship of insectivorous birds and " warningly
coloured " butterflies. He sent many birds, described as new to th&amp;lt;
collection, to the London Zoo.

899-1901; 1906-1913; 1921-1922.
John James Lewis Bonhote was born in London in 1875, an d died in
lournemouth on 10th October, 1922. The son of Colonel John Bonhote
te came of an old French ancestry. In 1897 he went to the Bahamas as
'rivate Secretary to the Governor, Sir Gilbert Carter, and during his
tay, and on a subsequent visit in 1901-1902, he made an investigation of
he fauna. He had extensive aviaries at Fen Ditton and later at Hemel
lempstead where he carried out much valuable research on the hybridiza-
ion of ducks, with a view to testing the fertility of hybrids through several
enerations. He was awarded the Society's Medal for the first breeding
&amp;gt;f the Spotted Eagle-Owl Bubo maculosus (1901).
Bonhote was for some years Sub-Director, Egyptian Government
&apos;oological Gardens, Cairo. On his return to England in 1919 his health
ras badly affected by the climate and within two or three years a very
reat ornithologist had passed on.
J. L. Bonhote's principal works are: " Birds of Britain ", 1907 (with
sveral later editions); " Vigour and Heredity ", 1915; and " Birds of
Britain and their Eggs ", 1923.
H. D. Astley
Elected June, 1895. Hon. Editor, 1912-1917: President, 1921-1925.

H. D. Astley had very splendid aviaries at Chequers Court, Benham
ark and Brinsop Court. His collections of waterfowl, cranes, flamingos,
arrakeets, pigeons and doves were among the best in the world. He also
ept many birds of paradise, humming birds and some of the rarer
lsectivorous birds. His breeding successes were very numerous and
acluded " firsts " with Red-capped Parrakeet (1909), Rose-breasted Gros-
eak (1911), Orange-headed Ground Thrush (1911), Hooded Parrakeet

Dr. Graham Renshaw
Elected January, 1910. Hon. Editor, 1917-1920.
Dr. Graham Renshaw was in medical practice in Sale, Manchester.
Dr. Renshaw was Editor during a very difficult period. His post-wa
efforts do not appear to have been sufficiently appreciated and this lad
of appreciation led him foolishly to publish a notice in the Magazine tha
gave the Council no option but to accept his resignation.
Dr. Renshaw was an extensive lecturer on zoology in the University 0
Manchester, reviewer in zoology for the " Medical Chronicle " and autho
of several works on natural history, including " More Natural Histor
Essays ", 1906; "Animal Romances ", 1918; and " More Anima

Reginald Innes Pocock was born in Clifton, Bristol, on 4th Marc!

In 1885 Pocock was appointed to an Assistantship on the staff of th
Zoological Department of the British Museum, in charge of the collec
tions of Arachnida and Myriopoda. He became Resident Superintenden
Zoological Gardens, London, in 1903. When administration of th
Gardens was reorganized in 1908, he was appointed Curator of Mammals
but retained his duties as Superintendent. He remained in office unt
March, 1923, when he retired on pension. The last twenty-four years c
his life were spent as a temporary scientific worker at the Natural Histor
Museum, his main interest being mammals.
Pocock was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, 4th May, 1911.

marine Lory (1939). He was particularly interested in liberty and semi-
liberty aviculture, and was very successful in establishing a strain of
homing Budgerigars. In addition, he did much to build up the herd of
Pere David s Deer which the nth Duke started from a few specimens
collected from various continental zoos. At one time the herd numbered
over three hundred. A similar story might be told of the almost extinct
European Bison.
The Marquess was the author of " Parrots and Parrot-like Birds in
Aviculture ", 1929 (revised American edition, 1954).
The Hon. Anthony Chaplin
Elected July, 1932. Hon. Editor, 1935 (part).
The Hon. Anthony Freskyn Charles Hamby Chaplin was born in
London on 14th December, 1906. He succeeded his father as the 3rd
Viscount (cr. 1916), of St. Oswalds, Blankney, in the county of Lincoln,
in 1949.
Lord Chaplin was Secretary, Zoological Society of London, 1952--1955.
He is at present a Trustee, Pheasant Trust. Besides being an excellent
bird artist he is an accomplished pianist and has published a number of
preludes for piano. He is especially interested in sunbirds, tanagers
and the smaller birds of prey.
Miss Ethel F. Chawner
Elected July, 1899. Hon. Editor, 1935 (part); 1936-1938.
Miss Ethel Florence Chawner lived for the greater part of her life in
Lyndhurst, Hampshire, and died at Leckford Abbas, Stockbridge, on
16th October, 1953.
Miss Chawner was very experienced in the keeping of owls and other
birds. Jardines's Pigmy Owl (1915) and White-eared Scops Owl (1923)
were among her " firsts ".
In 1927 she took charge of Mr. J. Spedan Lewis's magnificent collections
at Cookham-on-Thames and Wargrave-on-Thames. These ranged
from macaws to birds of paradise--the owls alone numbered over one
hundred. When Mr. Lewis moved to Leckford Miss Chawner was mainly
responsible for the formation of another large collection--pheasants,
waterfowl, cranes, owls, etc. And there she superintended until retire-
ment in 1939* Besides being a great aviculturist Miss Chawner was a
very knowledgeable botanist and entomologist.

J. DELACOUR--PROGRESS OF AVICULTURE
THE PROGRESS OF AVICULTURE DURING
THE LAST THREE QUARTERS OF
A CENTURY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995858421052632" page_id="58089663"  page_num="222" year="" vol="">
By J. Delacour (Cleres, France)
Man has kept birds in captivity since time immemorial for his comfort
and for his pleasure, but it can be said that Aviculture really started in
the 19th century only.
Little attempt to maintain and to propagate birds in Europe had been
made before, except for domestic fowls, canaries and native birds, mostly
finches. There were some exceptions, of course: Varro, in ancient Rome,
had a tremendous aviary; Louis XIV kept large birds at Versailles as
well as mammals, particularly waterfowl, including Cereopsis geese; the
Marquise de Pompadour, an enlightened lady, was a keen bird fancier,
responsible for the first importation of many finches and other small
species from Asia, Africa and America, which were the basis of many
of Buffon's studies, and the Empress Josephine possessed a fine private
zoo at Malmaison.
Birds also have been skilfully kept in cages in China, in Japan and in
India long before the Christian era, but, until recently, only as pets;
passerine birds and hawks, as a rule, in a very special, if excellent, way.
Many newly-discovered exotic animal specimens were brought over by
early explorers in the early 19th century to Paris, London, Antwerp,
Hamburg and other large zoos, and we find reports of their keeping and
breeding in literature. Many pertain to birds and it was the beginning
of true Aviculture. Soon a number of private collections, large and
small, were started in England, in France, in the Low Countries, in
Germany and elsewhere. They mainly consisted of Waterfowl, Game-
birds, Doves, Parakeets, Finches and Weavers. Tremendous successes
were scored in rearing and establishing captive breeding stocks of them,
some of which still exist today.
I began keeping birds as a mere child at the time of the foundation of
the Avicultural Society, and, at the age of fifteen, I already owned quite
a large collection at Villers-Bretonneux in Picardy. I soon came to meet
some of the great aviculturists of those days, particularly in France, in
Belgium, in Holland and in England. There were among them, MM.
Debreuil, Hermenier, Touchard, Delaurier; MM. Pauwels and Bracon-
nier; Mr. Blaauw; Messrs. Astley and Brook, The Duchess of Bedford
and her son, Lord Tavistock; Mrs. Johnstone, to mention only some very
important ones. All had excellent collections, but only a few of those
survived the 1914-1918 war. There were also a number of amateurs
and breeders, who, on a lesser scale, accomplished a very great deal.

Between 1918 and 1939, a considerable increase in avicultural activity
took place, and it was a true golden age for bird keeping. My dear friend
Alfred Ezra, our president for many years, gathered a magnificent collec-
tion at Foxwarren, as did the Duchess of Wellington, the Hon. Mrs. A.
Bourke, G. Gurney, Capt. de Quincey, Capt. Stokes, Ronald and Noel
Stevens, and H. Whitley in England; Mme. Lecallier, M. Decoux and
myself in France, and others in Europe and in America. Prof. Ghigi
already had at Bologna his famous collection of Pheasants, on which he
made so many genetical and biological observations and experimentation.
During this inter-war period of twenty years, air transportation was not
yet usual, and birds had to travel in ships. The principal dealers were
situated at the big harbours, and their birds were brought over by sailors.
It was often a long and hazardous trip, and the more valuable and delicate
species had to be secured and accompanied by professional collectors.
The best of them were W. Goodfellow (who had started before 1914),
C. S. Webb, W. Frost, F. Shaw Mayer and C. Cordier. A few of my
friends, myself and the London Zoo usually commissioned them and
they brought us every year marvellous fruit and insect-eating birds,
as well as others, in perfect condition, from the various parts of the world.
They were extremely clever and capable. Many of the rare species they
imported did well and bred in our aviaries and parks. The reader will
find records concerning them in the back volumes of our magazine.
Many of the rare birds brought over by these skilful men have never
again reached us.
Today, air transportation has changed the picture entirely. Native
trappers in remote parts of the world can despatch their catches easily
by aeroplane and the flights are so fast that even very delicate birds can be
left unattended until they reach their destination. Innumerable species,
which had never before been seen outside of their native countries, many
beautiful and unusual: Humming birds, Sunbirds, Quetzals, Tanagers,
Cocks of the Rock, etc., are frequently exported in numbers--in fact,
they have been captured far too much; the early losses have been tremen-
dous by lack of careful and knowledgeable handling and restriction of such
activities is urgently needed. As a result of this new situation, the great
harbours and bird shops of such as London, Liverpool, Marseilles,
Le Havre, Antwerp, Rotterdam, Hamburg, Genoa, have been closed, and
the new ones are found in the vicinity of the main airports.
As circumstances have changed considerably, so have the bird collec-
tions; very few large private ones remain, while numerous new zoos,
large and small, open to the public have appeared, particularly in England
and in France. Several of them maintain very good bird collections.
Keen bird keepers and breeders, however, who maintain comparatively
small numbers of rare and difficult species, very well housed and cared for,
are even more numerous than they used to be, and they carry on with the
same skill and enthusiasm the work of their predecessors.

There are also many commercial breeders of various birds: waterfowl,
pheasants, doves, parakeets, finches, who do extremely well with them
and keep up a very useful supply of captive-bred stock.
It is interesting to note that, as time passes, bird-keeping is gradually
becoming less difficult. Not only is transportation easier and faster, but
feeding and housing facilities are fast improving. Easily procurable and
scientifically composed foods are available. Many new medicines and
remedies make it possible to cure various diseases, which formerly were
fatal, and to save the life of many birds, particularly chicks.
Avicultural Societies, of which there are only a few in the world, ours
being the most important, are probably more prosperous today than at
any previous time. This is mostly due, I believe, to the greatly increasing
interest of the public in general in natural beauty, and birds stand
at the top of the ladder. It seems to be one happy result of a sad
human situation; the artificial, cramped, distressing conditions of life of
so many city people make them crave for trees, flowers and birds. It
contributes to the increase of our membership.
A very important fact is that aviculture has now been recognized as an
essential branch of behavioural and other biological studies. Ethology,
the science of behaviour, is a comparatively new one, and its workers have
soon found out that many facts of animal life cannot be learnt from free,
wild individuals. They depend more and more upon watching and
experimenting with captive specimens. There are numerous laboratories
which constitute a new form of aviculture.
In my early days, orthodox ornithologists considered aviculture just
as a nice hobby, and it was generally accepted that the observation of
confined birds was scientifically worthless. Captive animals were
supposed, as a result of a lack of knowledge, not to show the greatest part
of their natural behavioural patterns. I am happy to state that a complete
change of opinion has since taken place. Perhaps, in a small way, I have
contributed to this favourable reversal, as a good deal of my ornithological
work has been based on the study of captive birds, even those of a syste-
matic nature. My friend Konrad Lorenz, probably the best ethologist
of our time, has done more than anyone else to make aviculture a recog-
nized scientific endeavour. Practically all his remarkable work has
originated in the observation of captive birds as well as other forms
of animal life. We both started very young as enthusiastic bird lovers
and keepers; neither of us have any reason to regret it. Aviculture,
at present, has grown to be altogether a delightful kind of a sport,
from which great aesthetic pleasure and satisfactory interest is
derived, as well as a very important technique of Biological Science
as it is a necessary process for study. Also, it constitutes an importani
step in the preservation of the threatened species by their controllec
propagation.

By the oldest member of the Society Allen Silver
I have known as personal friends two of the original members of the
committee of our Society, viz.: Dr. R. G. Butler and Mr. John Frostick
for life until they passed on. Similarly this has applied to many other
prominent bird keepers who have been associated with the Avicultural
Society over the years since I became a member in 1904. I feel in the
75^ year of its existence that it is incumbent upon me to pay a tribute to
all who, in the past and the present, have done so much in their various
capacities to make the Society and its magazine what it is and the
reputation gained among aviculturists, not only in the British Isles
but also in the U.S.A. and Continental countries. If one turns to Volume
75 and peruses the list of officials, etc., one realises the work and care put
in by them in the interests of the Society in various ways. We have also
been fortunate as to our artists; among our coloured plates, some of the
best work of the late N. Goodchild and H. Grovold being used; also that
of Roland Green and more recently of David Reid-Henry. Possessing
every volume of our magazine from Vol. 1 to Vol. 75 on looking up items
I am sometimes astounded at the amount of detail these contain, many of
the instances which one had forgotten. It is pretty evident that
the Society has upon the whole been conducted on the right lines through-
out the years and has upheld its reputation due to the wise guidance of
those who have helped to shape its affairs.
Among these there have been many, but in fairness to all one is disin-
clined to select individuals. I feel however, that one cannot overlook my
old and valued friend, the late David Seth-Smith, who in whatever capacity
contributed so much to the benefit of our society. This also applied to the
late Alfred Ezra. Dr. Jean Delacour stands out for his valuable and interes-
ting contributions to our Society and its members. We have also been
fortunate in having as Editor our Miss Phyllis Barclay-Smith, m.b.e.
Everyone must pay tribute to the work and expense freely given over the
years to the Avicultural Society and its affairs by our President
A. A. Prestwich and his assistant Miss Kay Bonner. These, backed up by
a keen Council, are to be thanked for their untiring efforts. As a nona-
genarian I feel it a great honour to have my name bracketed with the
other Vice-Presidents of the Society.

From Dr. J. Steinbacher. Editor: Die Gefiederte Welt.
Die Gefiederte Welt as the oldest journal on bird-keeping offers the
Avicultural Magazine hearty greetings and sincere good wishes on its
75th anniversary. Coupled with this is an expression of high regard for
the invaluable service which the Avicultural Magazine has rendered
to bird-lovers all over the world in the increase of knowledge and under-
standing of the habits of innumerable birds, in the conservation of
threatened species and in the advance in knowledge of genetics, species
formation and classification.
The Avicultural Magazine in the decades of its publication has always
maintained a particularly high standard and thereby proved that a popular
applied science is possible without allowing the popular side to lower the
level of information.
The seriousness of its endeavours are internationally recognized and it
has always been a model and standard for other publications in this field.
It is hoped that in the future (up to the completion of the first century),
there will be forthcoming such far-sighted and capable Editors to produce
the contents, and contributors with such wide and varied knowledge, as
has been the case hitherto, in order that its guiding role in bird-keeping
may be retained and continued.
From Walter Page. Editor: Cage and Aviary Birds.
May I add my message of congratulations to those you will have
deservedly received now that the Avicultural Magazine has reached its
75th year of publication? Leading birdkeepers and breeders in this country
and abroad have appreciated its value over the years as the recognized
channel through which members of the Avicultural Society can report
their achievements.
Those who have occupied the editorial chair have never failed to main-
tain a high standard. Like your predecessors, you have ensured that the
familiar green-covered journal (a suitable colour since it serves the
" green-fingered " folk of avifauna) has remained an authoritative and
reliable record, but at the same time you have provided us with a journal
which is always interesting and fresh in appeal. This is, of course, due to
its readable and accurate contributions, its excellent colour plates and the
high-class reproduction or black and white photographs.
Praise is due to the Society for sponsoring it, the members for their
detailed papers describing birdkeeping experiences, the artists and
photographers for their work, the printers for their part and not least your
good self for collating and editing the material which enables you to present
so worthy a magazine. May it long continue to serve the growing number of
members of the Society.

From Dr. David Snow. Editor: The Ibis .
Congratulations on attaining your 75th year! I always welcome the
arrival of the current copy of the Avicultural Magazine, and although
I am not an aviculturist myself I nearly always find something in it which
interests me. Often it is an account of the breeding of a species whose nest
is unknown in the wild; sometimes it is a general behaviour note, or an
ornithological news item. The high quality of production, maintained
consistently over the years, and the frequent colour plates make your
journal a pleasure to consult and set a standard which not many others
can attain.
From Herbert B. Wragg. Secretary and Editor: Foreign Birds.
All those connected with the Foreign Bird League send their congratu-
lations to the Avicultural Society on its 75th Anniversary of the
Avicultural Magazine. The League has always admired the efforts
and activities of the Society and wish the Society and its members well
for the future.
From Charles K. Lucas, President , The Avicultural Society of Australia.
On behalf of the Avicultural Society of Australia, I, as President, send
our warmest congratulations on The Avicultural Magazine attaining
the ripe old age of 75 years. The Avicultural Society is the premier
Society of its kind and, over its long history, it has rendered outstanding
service to aviculturists throughout the world.
Our Society wishes to take advantage of this opportunity of offering our
grateful thanks to the long line of dedicated office-bearers of the Avicultural
Society who have since the advent of the Society devoted themselves so
successfully and tirelessly to the growth of our fascinating hobby. We
express the hope that the great work of the Society will be carried on with
the same dedication and success in the years that lie ahead.
From Eric Baxter. Secretary of The Avicultural Society of South
Australia.
On behalf of the Officers and members of the Avicultural Society of
South Australia, the oldest Avicultural Society in Australia, I wish to
extend to the Officers of the Avicultural Society congratulations for the
75th Anniversary of the Avicultural Magazine. This achievement merits
commendation of the highest order, and the fact that this has been achieved
is an example of enthusiasm unsurpassed and no doubt this is a proud
moment and a moment of great satisfaction to the Officers who have
contributed towards this with the sterling service they have rendered.
For the future our wish is for continued success, prosperity exceeding
that so far experienced, and above all increased support in recognition of
the service that is being rendered for the benefit of all interested in
aviculture.

From L. G. Howlett, President , New Zealand Avicultural Society.
From the " Land of the Kiwi " we extend congratulations and best
wishes to your Society on the 75th anniversary of the publication of the
Avicultural Magazine.
From Walter Van den bergh. Director , Antwerp Zoo.
For all those interested in the world of birds it would be difficult to
imagine being without the Avicultural Magazine, journal of the Avi-
cultural Society, London. During the 75 years of its publication it has
achieved incalculable results in pioneering work and rendered great
services not only to bird-lovers, but also to zoology in general.
Most important is the contribution that this journal has constantly
made towards the preservation of certain species of birds which without
support would have already become extinct.
All nature-lovers realise how few species of birds we have up to now
been able to breed in captivity. For this reason the Avicultural Magazine
has still an enormous task to fulfil.
We hope therefore that the Avicultural Magazine will maintain its
present position for many years to come, and will, moreover, be able to
extend its organization and influence in the service of all bird-lovers and
for the benefit of the world of birds and of nature-protection in general.
From G. Dener-Madsen. President , Editor: Selskabet for Stuekulturer I
Danmark.
The Society Selskabet for Stuekulturer I Danmark and the maga-
zine Stuekulturer congratulate the Avicultural Magazine on the 75th

educational magazine of the most exclusive kind, and send our thanks for
never-failing helpfulness.

By C. J. O. Harrison (Assistant Editor)
We tend to take the existence of societies such as ours so much for
granted that it is difficult to visualise the creation of such a society, or to
envisage the environment in which it came into being. The earliest
volumes of the magazine give us some information on the first, and
occasional odd sidelights on the second, the minor incongruities tending
to be the items which catch the eye.
The magazine started off a little rashly with the offer, in the opening
statement reproduced in this magazine, for advice to be given on all matters
by correspondence. This appears to have produced an embarrassment
of material since already, at the beginning of the second number in Decem-
ber 1894, the Secretary was apologising for having to omit letters through
lack of space. There was also an indication of early financial stringency
when, at the same time, he added " Mr. Sergeant has very kindly sent me
a charming design for the cover of our magazine, but the treasurer tells
me that he has not sufficient funds in hand to make use of it at present.
The cost of the block would be #1 16s. od. Will any of our wealthier
friends come to our assistance? " Since the cover used for the first
number continued to be used for several years we must conclude that they
wouldn't.
It was finance, and possibly shortage of articles, that limited the size
of the magazine, then a monthly, to eight pages an issue, but by the second
year this had risen to sixteen pages a month. As ever, written contribu-
tions were in variable supply. The first number included a part of an
article on the Great Skua by G. C. Williamson, a founder member. It
was entitled The Waterfall Pirate at Home " and was reprinted from
The Boy s Own Paper. It began " Mr. and Mrs. Lestris catarractes are
At Home every afternoon at Hermaness, Isle of Unst, Shetland Isles, but
the distance is too great for many people to go and pay their respects . . . ".
It was to be continued " but never was, and presumably gave precedence
to a more adequate supply of avicultural topics. However, an article a
year or two later which commenced " Our Secretary has informed me that
during these summer months ' copy ' is always short ..." strikes a
responsive chord in the present editorship and indicates that in some res-
pects little changes over the years.
By the end of the second volume it was announced that a substantial
valance in the hands of the treasurer enabled the society to increase the
ittractiveness of the magazine by including plates, and that the first one
reproduced in this number) would be prepared from a drawing by Mr.
^ rohawk, and " in those copies which will be sent to members the plate
vill be coloured by hand ".

C. J. 0. HARRISON--THE EARLY AVICULTURAL MAGAZINES
Relative costs were obviously different when one contributor wrote:
" On the floor of these three large cages I use sand collected from a well
rain-washed road. This material is the only alternative to Spratt's
threepenny bags, and I find it so very expensive to have such elegant sand
for general use that I send the gardener to get road sand for the floors,
while I put a little Spratt's in a tin for eating and gizzard purposes."
The birds that were advertised were not as low in price as one might
expect and for the commoner small birds the prices were only about half
what they might be today which, considering the depreciation in value
of the pound over 75 years suggests that they were relatively more expen-
sive. Native birds were probably cheaper but not often listed; although
there were unexpected items such as " Gold-crested Wrens, one year in
captivity " at 20/-, Herring Gulls at 5/- each and Lapwings at 4/6 the pair.
The tendency for dealers to invent new and fantastic names in order to
sell the birds or for those they could not identify, unfortunately still with
us, was criticised by writers at the time. There was more excuse for it
in that an absence of books on the birds of various regions made the
identification of some foreign birds very difficult for many people. There
seems less reason however for the European species to acquire exotic
names, and the Barred Warbler disguised as the Austrian Sparrow-hawk-
warbler must have puzzled some contemporaries. One could also pur-
chase to order, rock thrushes " ... and all other species of Continental
birds, in April and May Austrian nightingales from solitary woods (there-
fore much better singers than English nightingales), great nightingales,
and all other grand songsters from those high-mountainous countries
The passion for size was already corrupting species that had only
recently become popular and even in 1897 purchasers were being offered
" first-class last year's budgerigars, immense size, much larger than
imported ones, 8/6 ".
The debates on " to show or not to show " were with the society from
the start, and a proposal to define what should be exhibited as British
Birds caused considerable hard feeling between the Society and the
Managers of the Crystal Palace Show, and the British Bird and Mule
Club. From all accounts indifferent or bad lighting, which is still a major
fault, was always a characteristic of bird shows, but to judge from the
published comments the condition of some of the exhibits was often
worse than would be accepted today. Remarks about misidentification
or poor condition of exhibits in description of shows tended to give
rise to acrimonious correspondence where the exhibitors were members
of the society.
One's overall impression from these earlier volumes is, however, one of
little change. We are probably better off as regards diagnosis and treat-
ment of illness, and as regards our knowledge of diet. There seems to
have been a great deal of potato, bread and biscuit in earlier avian diets.
A number of losses of parrots and rarer waxbills were attributed to the

birds excessive intake of grit after a long voyage without it, to a point
where it was suggested that parrots should not be allowed to have any.
Little difference is apparent, however, in the articles on the general
keeping and observation of birds and were it not for the rather more
discursive and less factually precise style of the times many of the better
contributions could be reproduced in a current magazine without obvious
incongruity. Some of the articles are trivial, but in the main one cannot
but be impressed by the manner in which the determination of a number
af individuals to share, and to pass on, their knowledge and experience in
aviculture gave rise to a publication which, three-quarters of a century
later, still has this important function in the overlapping and integrating
worlds of bird-keepers, students of birds, and appreciators of the aesthetic
qualities of birds; which various aspects may often find combined expres-
sion in a single individual but for which we have no single term.

Though the Avicultural Magazine is described as " being the Journal
)f the Avicultural Society for the Study of British and Foreign Birds in
freedom and Captivity ' , the emphasis has naturally been on birds in
captivity. Such a journal is dependent for material on people keeping and
breeding live birds and in addition being able and willing to write up their
ixperiences and information gained. Further, as the membership of the
Society includes all varieties and grades of interest and knowledge, the
)alance between popular and scientific articles has to be carefully balanced,
t is therefore no mean achievement that the Magazine has come out
egularly for 75 years and survived the stresses and strains of two world
vars; but this achievement is due to the members of the Society.
The task of the Editor to produce a magazine each month was not easy,
-s the distinguished aviculturists who filled this post in the past found|
&amp;gt;articularly during the war and post-war years. In the April number'
917, Mr. Hubert Astley wrote, " The Editor greatly regrets that he has
ouched bed-rock in the matter of ' copy ' for the magazine and although
ie is fully aware of the extreme difficulty of supplying any nowadays he
sks members to do their utmost to uphold the magazine ".
Since its inception the volumes of the magazine dated from November
0 November, but in 1919 the December number was also included and
rom then on the volumes comprise the numbers issued in a calendar year.
Great difficulty was experienced in obtaining material during the years
ollowing the First World War and the numbers became very slim. In
921, in the May number, Mr. Pocock and Mr. Seth-Smith announced
hat the Editors regretted the delay in the publication of this number which

" is entirely due to there being no contributions at the time when the issue
was due to go to press They expressed their grateful acknowledge-
ments to the authors who responded to their urgent appeal for copy
and go on to say that they were compelled to impress on members that
they could not undertake the combined duties of editorship and authorship
of the Avicultural Magazine. They added, " The Editors feel sure
that out of the several hundred members of the Society there must be man\
with interesting items to record about their birds, who from timidity or
dilatoriness, or the mistaken opinion that the facts are of no importance 01
well-known, refrain fiom putting them in writing and sending them for
publication
The situation remained difficult till 1925, after which the Magazine
went from strength to strength owing to the great ability and drive of Mr
David Seth-Smith who had served as Editor (sometimes with a co-Editor
from 1901 to 1934, with only an interval of 10 years from 1910--1920.
It came, to say the least of it, as a surprise when, at an ornithologica
meeting in 1938 Mr. Alfred Ezra, Monsieur Jean Delacour and Mr. Davie
Seth-Smith came up to me and said, " We have an additional job for you
we want you to edit the Aviclltural Magazine
" But I CAN'T ", I replied, " I'm not an aviculturist "--" No matter
we will help you And that is how it all began. Thanks to the effort*
of all three I gradually graduated to being an aviculturist.
In 1939 the great private collections were at their zenith -the Presideni
of the Society, Mr. Alfred Ezra, at Foxwarren, Jean Delacour at Cle&apos;es
Jean-Marie Derscheid at Armendy in Belgium, the Marquess of Tavistocl
in Sussex, Spedan Lewis in Hampshire, Albert Pam in Hertfordshire, anc
Ronald and Noel Stevens in Shropshire, to mention only a few. Article:
were easily forthcoming and the editorship of the magazine was botl
stimulating and gratifying. But with the outbreak of war in Septembe
1939, this happy state of affairs was soon to undergo a profound change
and within three weeks I was swept up--albeit most willingly into tb
war-machine. I think perhaps the editorial published in the Octobe
number 1939 best gives an indication of the situation at that time.
''Aviculture is a bond which knows no political differences and is a lin.
between the peoples of different nations which is hard to be broken. Th
Avicultural Society, though a British organization, is essentially inter
national in its composition and has members of many different nationalitie
and in every part of the globe, brought together by a common interest.
A war has now broken upon us bringing untold misery and suffering
a war which no one wants and which we have done our utmost to avoic
It is not a war against a country, but a war against a system which ha
already brought persecution, destitution, and despair to countless member
of the German nation itself.

During the months it has been my privilege to be the Editor of the
Avicultural Magazine I have considerably increased the links with other
nations, by means of exchange of publications with scientific institutions
and societies, and by requesting contributions from aviculturists in other
countries. It is my sincerest hope that these new links, as well as the old,
will hold, and though we are now inevitably cut off from the German
aviculturists, I feel sure I am voicing the opinion of the majority of their
colleagues in other countries in saying that the friendly regard for them
will remain unchanged, and if they ever read these words they will know
that no bitterness if felt towards them or towards the German nation.
The present struggle is as surely for the salvation of Germany as against
her leaders.
The bonds between the Avicultural Societies in the great British
Commonwealth of Nations has always been close and sincere, but the
mmediate response to the mother country's need has united us even
nore surely. Backed by the Empire, Great Britain with her staunch ally,
France, by keeping their pledge to valiant Poland, once more stand fast
igainst the wreckers of the peace of Europe.
The future is uncertain and obscure, but in the end right must prevail,
n the dark days that are before us we must never give way to the inclina-
ion to assume that there is no future at all and that all culture is lost for
;ver.
The Avicultural Magazine will continue so long as is possible, and
t shall be my utmost endeavour that it shall not fail. Amongst the
naterial in hand are some articles from German contributors and these
t is my intention to publish, although I cannot submit the translations
md proofs to the authors.
The efforts of the majority of people will be mainly concentrated on
ome form of national service, but continuous work without relaxation is
lot humanly possible. I hope, therefore, that members will endeavour
0 send me contributions for the Magazine, that they will continue to
upport the Society, and that we may strive not to lose the more beautiful
.nd aesthetic side of life."
Like a snail with its shell I took the Magazine with me during my various
r icissitudes of the war--typing on rickety tables in billets--correcting
&amp;gt;roofs during the rare occasions when there was a lull during night-duty
t the Foreign Office, and later finding even the pasting-up of the pages
relief and relaxation from the underground existence deep in the Gor-
ham caves in the production of a new secret aircraft engine. When I
3st my home and all my possessions by a direct hit during the Battle
&apos;f Britain the editorial headquarters of the magazine were literally a large
uitcase.
During 1940 the standard and size of the Magazine were maintained,
ut at the end of that year with the fall in income and the rise in cost of

production it was essential that economy should be made and it was there-
fore decided to publish the Magazine every second month.
With the progress of the war the pinch became tighter, particularly with
the advent of paper rationing, and the Magazine became very slim.
The 50th Anniversary of the Avicultural Society in 1944 could not be
celebrated as it would have been in ordinary circumstances, and the only
method of marking this important event was by the publication of a
Jubilee Supplement and this duly appeared in November of that year.
It did not come into being without many difficulties and set-backs, the
worst being the final refusal of the Paper Controller to the request for 2
special ration for this purpose. The publication was only made possible
by careful saving of pages over the previous twelve months, and the in-
valuable co-operation of the printers, Messrs. Stephen Austin, whc
despite shortage of staff, shortage of supplies and many other worries,
managed to print the special supplement on time.
Since the war the Magazine has gradually built up again, though with a
difference. Most of the great collections of the past have now gone, but
a new pattern has appeared in the bird parks open to the public such as
Slimbridge, Birdland, the Norfolk Wildlife Park, the Tropical Bird
Gardens, Rode and others, which have proved that they can give much
interesting information and achieve first breedings, as well as serve as an
attraction for the public.
The interest in bird behaviour has increased enormously in the last
few decades and now many people who are interested in this absorbing
subject have in the process become aviculturists and are invaluable
contributors to the magazine.
It has always been my nightmare that one day I would have to issue the
Magazine as a cover with no insides. Were it not for the indefatigable
and unceasing efforts of Arthur Prestwich--who ever since his appoint-
ment as Hon. Secretary and Treasurer in 1949 has pleaded, cajoled anc
bullied members into contributing articles, setting a good example by the
great amount he writes himself (not letting-up even with his additional
responsibilities as President)--that nightmare would undoubtedly have
become a reality.

"ALBIE " THE ALBATROSS
By Karl Plath (Brookfield Zoo, Illinois, U.S.A.)
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.995026571428571" page_id="58089682"  page_num="241" year="" vol="">
One of the most interesting and best loved of all the birds ever to be
shown at the Brookfield Zoo, where I was curator of birds, was a Galapagos
Albatross, Diomedia irrorata , which lived the record time for any captive
Galapagos Albatross, four years and six months. Generally, the birds of
the order Procellariformes, which include the Albatrosses, Fulmars,
Shearwaters and Petrels, always have been considered unsuitable and
practically impossible subjects for zoological exhibition.
Compared with the Wandering Albatross, immortalized in Coleridge's
"Ancient Mariner ", which has a wingspread of over 11 ft. and an aver-
age weight of 16 lbs., the Galapagos Albatross is a smaller bird with
wingspread of 7 ft. 4 ins. and only about 4 J lbs. of weight.
Three Galapagos Albatrosses were received some years ago in our
Brookfield Zoo: one adult, and two somewhat younger birds showing
:races of unshed down. They refused all food at first but the untiring
patience of the keepers prevailed and after a few weeks they settled down
ind began eating heartily. It was discovered that they would eat if hand-
ed and their diet was strips of boned pike soaked in salt water, one of which
contained a capsule of codliver oil. They would open their strong beaks
ind let the keepers put the strips, one at a time, into their throats until
;atisfied. It was not long before they greeted the keeper at the door
vhen he came to feed them, uttering hoarse croaks all the while.
The older and larger Albatross we decided was a male and it was
imusing to see him and a smaller female performing their mating cere-
uony, bowing and scraping to each other, and then throwing their heads
l P and giving their groaning call in unison. After seven months one of
hem died and ten months later another. The remaining bird was the
irge adult which had become so docile we affectionatelv named him
Albie ".
"Albie " proved to be one of the most interesting birds we had and was
lost amusing to the general public when he strutted in his comical,
ompous swagger before them, swinging his head from side to side,
dthough the great flying cage in the Aquatic House where "Albie " and
ie other water birds were kept was 96 ft. long, 40 ft. wide and 22 ft.
igh, it was not large enough to permit him to fly and he contented
lmself with spreading his long wings, leaning back and fanning the air.

When the long winter season was over the doors were opened to the
larger flying cage outdoors. "Albie " was the first to notice and he would
waddle hurriedly out to stretch and prance into the wind with wings
outspread, and then bask contentedly in the sun until feeding time. He
would then get up, return to the inside flying cage and walk as slowly and
pompously as possible the full length of the flying cage to the door where
Walter, the keeper, had entered to feed him.
"Albie " was a temperamental bird. He would never eat anything
from a pan and would very seldom stand in the water. Any hurried
movement would disturb him. If the fish was not offered in the right way
he would turn and walk away and no amount of persuasion would get
him to eat. If any pelican ventured to attack him he was unafraid and
would defend himself ably. He was a gentleman and never interfered
with the smaller birds in any way and remained aloof from all the social
life of the flying cage. One could say "Albie " was stupid because he
never responded to his name, but he did pick up little tricks in behaviour
rapidly and these made it fun to take care of him.
In size "Albie " was about as large as a goose because of the long and
thick plumage. His wings were very long and tail very short. The
head and neck were white, tinged with buff on the nape. The back, wings
and tail were dark greyish-brown with a few scattered white spots and the
lower parts finely vermiculated with dark grey and white. The pale
yellow beak was larger in proportion than that of any other species oj
Albatross. His feet were pale bluish.
The only known breeding place of this species is on Hood Island of the
Galapagos Archipelago and it ranges the southern seas of the Galapagos
to the seas of Ecuador and Peru. Unlike other species of Albatrosses
which build up a round, flattened hill-like nest, the Galapagos species
builds no nest at all. In the natural state this Albatross like most of th&amp;lt;
other species, feeds mainly on small squids, though it has been seei
pursuing shoals of small fish.
Of the 13 known species of Albatross this is the only one technically
equatorial; nine species are found in the temperate zone south of th&amp;lt;
equator and only three species in the temperate and northern zones of th
Pacific.
During the last few months of his life "Albie " developed a malformatioi
of the lower mandible. It grew nearly an inch longer than the maxilla
inclining downward so that the beak was open at the tip. It becain
increasingly difficult to feed him and he gradually refused all food. Hi
death was a great loss to his keeper and me and for a long time after v
were asked many questions regarding ' ' that funny clown bird . I like t
think of him as stoically adjusting to a perpetual life on the ground. Hi
natural-born instinct to spread his great wings and sail motionlessly in th
air could never be fulfilled. My innate love and interest in birds wa
analogous; I experienced a marvellous thrill on seeing for the first time

rare bird in its natural habitat, yet an even greater satisfaction in being
able to keep Albie in captivity successfully--even if for only a few years.
Recently the San Diego Zoological Park was successful in keeping a
Black-footed Albatross, D. nigripes , for a period of seven years. This
albatross ranges the oceans north of the Equator and is much more com-
mon than the Galapagos species. As squids are the preferred food of all
species of albatross and are easily obtainable on the coast waters of Cali-
fornia this may have been the main reason for San Diego's success in
keeping the Black-footed Albatross successfully. Being able to keep it
out of doors the year round was also a contributing factor.

(Chalcomitra senegalensis gutturalis)
By Bryan E. Reed (Wednesbury, Staffordshire, England)
Since the near miss that my partner, Mr. A. Holmes and myself had
with this species in 1964 and our first breeding success in 1965 (see
Avicultural Magazines, Vol. 70, No. 5 and Vol. 71, No. 4) we have
had the following failures and success.
The adults were placed in a flight 3 ft. x 3 ft. x 6 ft. high to
attempt breeding again on 22nd May 1966. The hen commenced to
build the nest on 25th May and finished it on 31st May. As before,
it was only built when the sun was shining, the hen soaking the
material in the bath water before carrying it to the nest. She was first
noticed sitting on 4th June. She was noticed catching lots of fruit
flies on 18th June and on the morning of 19th June part of an
eggshell was found on the floor when they were being fed. As before, the
feeding of the youngster was carried out almost entirely on spiders. (A
formidable task.) All went well until 2nd July when the youngster
suddenly refused to feed, although the hen kept attempting to give it
spiders. We took it out of the nest, but could not see anything wrong
with it, and it died in my hand about 10 minutes later at 12 noon. It was
fully feathered and only had a few feathers that were unopened. It was
ilso a nice size and had not lost any weight. The hen commenced sitting
igain on 9th July. An eggshell was found on the floor on 22nd July.
Unfortunately we had great difficulty in finding sufficient live food and
he youngster was found dead on the floor on 26th July. The adults
:ommenced moulting in August and were separated.
On 24th June 1967 they were again placed together to attempt breeding.
We left it rather late as we were attempting to get other species of Sun-
)irds to nest.) The nest was started on 26th June, and was completely

built by the evening of 27th June. The hen was first noticed sitting
on 30th June 1967. The two eggs had not hatched on 15th July
and as the hen appeared to have deserted it was decided to check them.
They were found to be infertile. The parents again commenced moulting
in August and were separated. No further attempt was made to nest that
season.
This year (1969) the hen was placed in the flight on 31st May.
The cock was put in with her on 15th June. (The nest had already
been built prior to placing the cock with her.) Two eggs were laid.
(Possibly late on the 18th June or early on the 19th and late on the 20th.
The hen seemed very heavy near the vent on the 18th and 20th.) Two
youngsters hatched, one on 3 r( ^ J U ^Y an( ^ the other on 4th July.
The hen was seen feeding them by hanging on the nest in the typical
Sunbird manner. The young birds were not yet visible, but a very
slight cheep could be heard and she was feeding to both sides of the nest,
which seemed to indicate two youngsters. The cock was removed from
the flight on 6th July as he was worrying the hen, and it was thought he
had made her bleed slightly above the bill, although this later proved to be
a Kirk's hen nesting in the next compartment.
On the 7th July we first saw the youngsters, they were feathering nicely
and seemed quite lively. The consumption of spiders was again limited
to the number we could catch, and not the number they would eat. It
varied throughout the whole period they were in the nest; between 150-
200 per day. Luckily the hen also supplemented it with very ripe pear.
(She also took about five or six very small maggots per day in the later
stages.) The sacs containing the droppings were removed from the nest
about six times a day. The youngsters were seen in the nest by several
of our English members, and also by two Swedish visitors, Mr. Thomas
R. M. Brosset and his friend Mr. Lars-Ake Jungbeck.
Despite a very worrying two weeks in which we were searching for
spiders almost continuously the first youngster left the nest on 22nd July
at about 10 a.m. It fed itself from the nectar bottle almost immediately
but went back in the nest about 5 p.m. to sleep. It did not come out of
the nest again until 24th July. The hen then commenced to worry it, sc
we took the youngster out of the flight and placed it in a cage by itself, at
approximately 1 p.m. The hen had not been feeding either of the
youngsters that morning and had looked as though she was feeling the
effects of rearing two youngsters. As soon as the youngster was removed
she immediately relaxed and looked very ill indeed. We decided tc
remove her and place her in the hospital cage. As soon as we picked hei
up, (it was not a question of catching her as she was very weak although she
had shown no symptoms until that morning), she had what appeared to be
a " fit " in my hand.
The rest of the symptoms almost exactly followed "Apoplectitorrr
Septicemia " as described in Stroud&apos;s Digest of Bird Diseases. The

treatment finally chosen was Stroud's Salts No. i, i.e. Sodium Perborate.
(Various antibiotics were tried but to no avail.) She kept having fits and
shaking her head. By 26th July she had lost the use in one wing and one
leg, and she could only lie on the floor (she could not perch). She was
extemely ill on 27th, 28th and 29th July. On 30th and 31st July there was
a slight improvement, and late on 31st July and 1st August she could stand
on the perch. Although she was very shaky she was hand fed every half
hour, 18 hours a day, from 24th to 31st July by one or other of us or our
families. My diary records that she fed herself for the first time on 2nd
and 3rd August, and continued to improve. She again had a slight fit on
the 6th August, but had recovered within five minutes. She improved every
day from then on and was put down the aviary again in a cage on the 14th
August. By 20th August she was again back in breeding condition but we
were exhausted for this season, so we left her on her own!!! (We would
like to hear from anyone who think they could possibly throw any light on
the above mystery.) Regarding the treatment, for about the first week
whenever the few grains of Sodium Perborate were left out of the nectar
she started to look worse again.
You will by now be wondering what had happened to the other
youngster. After placing the hen in the hospital cage on 24th July, we
got into the flight to have a look at it. Upon our peering into the nest the
young bird left immediately. It was placed in the cage with the other one.
For the first couple of days we helped it to feed, as we were not sure if it
would be alright, but it continued to grow and seemed fit so we discon-
tinued this. The relative size and details of the youngsters are as follows :
1 st youngster: two-thirds size of adults on leaving the nest. Slightly
darker and bill straighter than 2nd youngster, more barred below. It also
ias a darker throat.
2nd youngster, half the size of adults on leaving the nest, more olive-
fellow below. Bill slightly more curved.
By the 1st August they were almost the same size as each other, i.e.
ipproximately three-quarters the size of adults. On the 3rd September
hey were approximately seven-eighths the size of the adults, but the 2nd
youngster is still slightly smaller They are very fit. The " gape "
narks were still slightly visible.
In conclusion a few words on the youngster that we bred in 1965 would
lot be amiss. After removing the youngster from its parents on 29th
une 1965 it continued to do very well. It commenced its first moult on
5th October 1967 and by 3rd November it was evident that it was a cock
vhen three pin feathers opened on its chest. This moult was only partial
n that the general colour remained as the hen, but with a small area of
ed on the chest and a few black feathers on its body. Its second moult
/as August 1966, but it still did not attain full colour, i.e. the plumage
till had quite a bit of grey and brown flecks on the tips of the body
sathers. It also had grey rings round its eyes. At the third moult,

which commenced on 24th June 1967* it attained full colour. It moulted
again in August 1968 and commenced this year's moult on 3rd August,
1969. It is a very fine bird and extremely fierce. If a finger is placed by
its cage it will put out its chest like a guardsman and chatter to itself. If
the offending finger is not removed it will attack it vigorously. This year
(1969) it has even taken to flying on to your hand if you place it in the cage,
after giving you the above warning. It will then hang on with its feet
while flapping its wings and attacking your thumb (occasionally the fingers)
with its bill.

(Sturnus vulgaris)
By T. S. Thomson (Hoole, Cheshire, England)
It has been written that the Starlings flock together during the winter,
and in April they split up into pairs, but I find that the breeding cycle is
continuous with birds which are resident in this country.
A breeding pair of European Starlings will spend quite a few weeks in
the autumn at the old nest, cleaning it out and adding a little fresh
material, which may be later rejected when the nest is properly made in the
spring. In captivity it was not found necessary to provide the birds
with nest-boxes except in the breeding period. If nest-boxes were not
removed after nesting, the birds used them as sleeping quarters. While
it should always be recommended that breeding pairs of softbills have a
compartment to themselves, Starlings will breed on the colony system.
In the first season with this species some years ago, seven wild caught
birds were enclosed in an aviary 30 ft. x 20 ft. As sexing is not an easy
matter, the pairing up was left to the birds. Two pairs produced eggs.
As the writer was working 100 miles from home, only returning home at the
weekends, it was considered best to concentrate on one nest only. The
other nest which was situated in the 6 ft. x 9 ft. catching up compartment
in the aviary, was shut off. An opening was made in the roof netting
near the nest and this second pair were left to rear their young on the
semi-liberty system, which had been successfully practiced with other
species. The first pair were to be treated as aviary birds and their young
reared under aviary conditions as a first breeders medal was at stake.
This required the registration and verification of the breeding by officials
at various stages.
For the past few years Starlings have been kept in good condition on
little more than poultry pellets as the mainstay of their diet. However,
when breeding was practiced a much more varied menu was offered. An
insectile mixture (Haiths) formed the base. Starlings were often observed
an lawns probing for food which includes the grass-devouring wireworms
and the occasional earthworm is also taken. However, if earthworms are
not a regular addition to an aviary kept Starling's diet, it will probably
refuse them if they are offered at the vital period when young are in the
nest. This was found to be the case here, not only with Starlings but also
Blackbirds and Thrushes. Mealworms were offered and readily accepted,
:ogether with gentles. As these two items are easily obtainable, the
nreeding Starlings enjoyed them as a regular addition to the insectile
mixture. Rotten fruit, mainly apples and pears were offered in season,
is were scraps from the household, including bones to pick over.
In the wild, the Starling feeds its young mainly on insects, and other
nvertebrates. Beetles, weevils, larvae and the grubs of flies add variety.

T. S. THOMSON--BREEDING THE EUROPEAN STARLING
It may be observed catching high-flying insects on the wing, in a swallow-
like manner.
Gentle " factories " were set up to provide regular supplies. These
were funnel-shaped units, the top part holding the fish scraps used to
propagate the gentles which dropped to the second story, consisting of a
container with sand/sawdust mixture, before dropping again into a tray to
which the birds had access. This tray contained an earth compost
mixture about one inch deep in which the steady drop of gentles found
refuge until removed by the Starlings.
The provision of regular supplies of mealworms was a problem, the
writer, as stated above, being absent on week days when the birds were
left on their own. About a pound (weight) of mealworms were left in
an open tray with suitable overlapping edges to prevent their escape.
The tray contained leafy compost to give the mealworms cover and to
spread the supply over as long a period as possible. However, a meal-
worm tray did not prove a success as the Starlings quickly scattered its
contents in their efforts to find the mealworms; which they preferred to the
gentles. Under normal conditions with the breeder present daily, very
frequent supplies of mealworms is desirable; little and often being the
order of the day.
While five or more eggs are a Starling's normal clutch, it is advisable
to reduce the number of young. Far better to produce two healthy
youngsters than a nest of weaklings dying off one after the other. After
the young hatch, all but the strongest three are removed, and after a few
days only two are left to be reared. This practice is to be recommended
in the breeding of most species of softbills and even hardbills. Even in
the wild the casualty rate in young in the nest is high. This may be the
result of where the survival of hole-fed nestlings depends on the survival
of the fittest. The parents do not enter the nest-box after the young are
old enough to reach the hole of the box where they are fed. From this
stage the sanitation of the nest is neglected and any young which succumb
do not greatly add to the mess as they decay. Both parents attend
to the young and it may be of interest to many to know that both birds
share the incubation of the eggs, the hen, however, doing the larger part
of this task. It was observed that whenever the hen left the eggs, the cock
bird would immediately take over the incubation, until relieved in turn
by the hen.
When the young become self-supporting it is important to maintain the
supply of live food for a few weeks before they are gradually weaned on to
the insectile mixture. A small daily supply of live food is desirable when
this stage is reached, but not necessary,
Over a period of five seasons young were ringed in the nest with close
rings and no losses were incurred as a result of such action; even although
the Starling's maintained a high standard of nest sanitation in the early
stages of rearing the young. Two and sometimes three lots of young may

be reared in the one season. The breeding of Starlings by aviculturists
in England is neglected, the cost of producing young being much more
than the market price of the birds.
Young were bred from an all-white starling hen (dark eyed), but no
rare-feathered offspring were obtained, even when sons were paired back
to white mother bird. If the white Starling had been red-eyed (albino) it
would have been possible to produce their kind, as is practiced at present
with cinnamon and lutino greenfinches. There are also other mutations
in existence including pied, cinnamon and silver, which would give a
wide scope for any breeder.
It is good practice to provide alternative nesting sites for birds being
bred in captivity but the Starlings' requirements are easily met, a lovebird
type nest-box being readily accepted. When colony breeding is practiced,
extra nest-boxes are desirable. In courtship the cock hounds the hen
quite a lot, driving her into the nest-box, where she finds refuge. More
squabbling will be noted between a courting cock and hen than between
rival birds, but, of course, this depends on the size of the unit in which
breeding birds are housed, the larger the better. When birds are kept
on the colony system more than one feeding-point is recommended.
It is desirable to install birds in an aviary some months before the breeding
season, leaving it to the late Spring might result in negative results.

By T. S. Thomson (Hoole, Cheshire, England)
After a winter of repeated cold spells followed by a wet spring, the 1969
breeding season was considered a fairly satisfactory one. Success was
achieved with 31 species while three failed to produce any young.
Approximately 430 birds were reared to maturity. This number includes
over 100 young from several species of liberty birds which were kept in
confinement all season, as a result of the editorial comment in the March/
April issue of the Magazine. Some of the small foreign young will not
probably live to reproduce. On the other hand, Green Cardinals reared
strong healthy young practically without any extras. Pheasants, Quail and
Partridge totalled about no birds and British birds 170 plus, including
3 ver 80 Softbills which are the subject of this report.
Thirty-two Songthrushes, Turdus philomelos , seven Mistle Thrushes,
T - viscivorus, 13 Starlings, Sturnus vulgaris , one Fieldfare, T. pilarus,
11 Blackbirds, T. merula and 19 Hedgesparrows, Prunella modularis were
eared to maturity. Enclosures of various sizes were used, ranging from
[ 5 ft- by 6 ft., to 90 ft. by 80 ft. In past seasons some of the above species
iad reproduced without any attention, finding all the food necessary,
dowever, breeding successes were usually limited to the first rounds. In

T. S. THOMSON-- 1969 BREEDING RESULTS AT HOOLE
an effort to maintain an ideal environment throughout the season, wild
rabbits were introduced into an aviary in order to crop the grass which, if
allowed to grow long, restricts the feeding area. However, the rabbits
had to be removed. It was quite a surprise to find that they were able
to climb up fruit trees, sometimes up to 12 ft., eating bark or the current
year shoots. The damage was too extensive hence their removal. Geese
prove suitable as grass cutters but the scythe has to supplement their
efforts. In another enclosure a perforated hose pipe fed from a 300 gallon
tank, maintained ideal worm activity during dry spells when the ground
would normally be rock hard. Autumn leaves spread on bare patches in
other aviaries kept the birds active. Lawn mowings were also used.
Three maggot " factories " were in constant production, two fed with fish
waste and the other with scraps from the butcher. A compost heap of
about four cubic yards, prepared in the autumn, provided large quantities
of reddish-type earthworms. About 2 ins. of compost, full of worms
were skimmed off, about a bucketful a time, and placed in metal trays.
With pheasants kept in most of the enclosures housing the breeding
softbills, the additional supplies of live food had to be guarded with 3-
inch wire netting covers. In one aviary young Quail soon found the live
food. In another young Waterhens made frequent raids, without parental
escort, on the maggot trays.
Breeding pairs of Song Thrushes were housed in aviaries of various
dimensions. With one-year-old birds it is normal practice to put three
together in order to sex them. In one enclosure 70 ft. by 70 ft., two young
hens with a young cock raised two rounds each. The enclosure is a
vegetable garden and as the season advanced frequent hoeing left the soil
in a dust bath condition. While the borders of the garden planted with
pear trees and soft fruit bushes, provided some live food, it was necessary
to supplement the natural live food supplies with maggots. Data compiled
over 10 seasons indicate one-year-old stock do not produce as many
young as older birds. One 10 year-old Song Thrush did not la}/ daily
and birds about this age have smaller clutches. Also best results are
obtained early in the season. The trio of Song Thrushes had occasional
skirmishes but generally they were occupied with their domestic duties.
The first two nests were built fairly close together, about 15 ft. apart,
considering the space available. It was of interest to record the cock s
part in the rearing of both broods. Observations reveal cock Song
Thrushes, Mistle Thrushes and Blackbirds feed the newly-hatched young,
the hens mainly occupied with the brooding. When a cock bird arrived
at the nest the hen would raise herself and allow the cock to feed the young.
On occasion a hen would hold live food for some time in her bill, before
passing it on. This may have been taken direct from the cock or picked
out of the nest after the young were fed. With the two nests hatching a
few days apart the cock Thrush attended both broods. Normally where
three young Song Thrushes are being sexed by the method indicated above,

the odd bird is removed, especially where the enclosure is of modest
dimensions. \ oung hens on their own have built, layed and reared young
of others.
The breeding results from Song Thrushes housed in various sized
aviaries indicate it is not so much the extent of the unit but the availability
of adequate supplies of live food, which influences successful results.
In addition the provision of live food throughout the season, whether as a
supplement or a natural supply in a large aviary, had a bearing on the
number of young reared. It is not sufficient to offer live food when the
young hatch and during the rearing period. The annual urge to reproduce
is so strong in bird life, many kept in confinement attempt to breed under
adverse conditions, resulting in failure. Results from breeding pairs
housed in similar conditions in 20 ft. by 6 ft. aviaries reveals a marked
difference in the total young reared, when live food is rationed. A con-
tinuous supply of live food first offered before the season begins results in
an early start to the season, in more rounds per pair, a shorter interval
between nests and more young per round. Under ideal conditions four
rounds were achieved. To support ideal breeding conditions it is
desirable to remove the young as soon as they are self-supporting, normally
within a week of fledging. With a limited supply of live food young birds
were maintained in good condition on a diet of poultry pellets fed from a
hopper, 10 to 12 birds being housed in 15 ft by 5 ft. aviaries.
As one who has frequently advocated the reduction of broods of most
species of British either by removing eggs or young at an early age, the
research with breeding Song Thrushes calls for some qualification of
this advice. In cases when parent birds, whatever the species, are not
able to find enough food, the numbers raised may be smaller than if they
had started with a smaller brood. With some breeding pairs of Song
Thrushes housed in what was considered better than natural conditions,
double brooding " was practiced. Young were removed from pairs
which would benefit from a reduction in the brood size and given to ideally
housed pairs. It was most necessary that all the young in a double brood
nest were of the same age and stamina. In spite of careful matching,
young in a double brood nest developed erratically, resulting in death and
rejection from the nest. The greatest number reared from double broods
of seven and eight was five. The growth of young in normal size broods
frequently varied, this being most noticeable at the ringing period which
could be spread over three to four days. Long dry spells also had a bearing
on the different rate of growth of the young in the same nest. The smaller
the brood-size the less variation in the young.
In addition to breeding in aviaries of various sizes, the liberty method
added to the successes. There are many variations of this method of
rearing birds. With the trio of Song Thrushes referred to above, it was
intended to remove the 70 ft. by 70 ft. nylon netting roof of their aviary.
A pair of Blackbirds were also nesting with the Thrushes and last season,

1968, they were liberated after rearing a first round. After liberation the
Blackbirds returned to the compound and completed a second round. It
was intended to repeat the process with the Song Thrushes this season but
the views expressed about this method of keeping birds dictated that they
be confined to their aviary, there being several other species involved.
On the other hand, a pair of Song Thrushes were specially housed in a
15 ft. by 6 ft. aviary having a roof opening. When the young hatched this
skylight type of exit was opened up. The entrance/exit was specially
sited to retain the young, being in the middle of the flight netting. A
branch was placed immediately under the opening and after the parents
had become accustomed to flying in and out, it was removed before the
young fledged. With this method, as an additional precaution to retain
the young, clipping a wing has proved satisfactory. Where there is no
desire to retain the young it has been found that the best arrangement
for exits and entrances is provided by making openings at ground level and
also in the flight roof netting. Another point of interest associated with
the liberty breeding method is a bird's ability to search for natural food
on being released. It has been found that birds kept on a diet of meal-
worms and maggots were incapable of searching for worms and cases have
occurred where Blackbirds refused supplies dug up and thrown down for
them.
A study was made of the rate of growth in the young Song Thrushes
reared under the various conditions. It is normally difficult to better
the results obtained in the wild but this was achieved during prolonged
dry spells. The results from aviaries where special action was taken to
maintain earthworm activity compared favourably with results from liberty
breeding. The total number of Thrushes reared must greatly exceed
that of birds nesting in the wild, with the added protection given. Cock
Song Thrushes would come into song each time nest building was nearing
completion and the eggs being laid. On more than one occasion a com-
pleted nest was abandoned, another being built immediately. Some
nests were built within two days, there being a few days interval before the
first eggs appeared.
Much of what has been written about Song Thrushes probably applies
to Blackbirds, Mistle Thrushes and Fieldfares, but with fewer pairs
employed it was not possible to obtain relative data to all that covered the
case of the former. One pair of Mistle Thrushes reared seven young from
three rounds. They were overwintered in a 40 ft. by 100 ft. aviary on a
diet of apples and poultry pellets plus earthworms which increased in
supply as the Spring advanced. Their aviary was opened up to a 80 ft.
by 90 ft. planted compartment with matured fruit trees pruned down to
12 ft. Within a week the Mistle Thrushes commenced nest building,,
selecting a site 3 ft. 6 ins. off the ground. This was quite exposed, the
many prefabricated nesting sites being ignored. With the trees not yet in
leaf such sites, made up of shrub cuttings, are provided for the birds.

especially Greenfinches. Over 100 prefabricated nesting sites are
furnished each season. 1 hree young Mistle Thrushes were reared from
the four out of the five eggs which hatched. The young were fed entirely
on small earthworms. As soon as the young were self-supporting they
were moved to a 20 ft. by 12 ft. aviary. A bird-keeper from the local
Zoo remarked on seeing the young Mistle Thrushes, that two or three
pairs nesting in the Zoo grounds has only started building.
Within a week of the young leaving the nest it was rebuilt by the birds.
The inside lining of grasses was removed down to the mud base and fresh
grasses added to complete the nest. Eggs soon followed and all went well
until the young were a few days old. A prolonged wet spell with torrential
rain saturated the nest. One young Mistle was found dead some
distance away from the nest. The hen continued to brood continually,
the young being fed by the cock. Observations revealed the hen was
reluctant to leave the soaked young, even to allow the cock to feed them.
The exceptional wet conditions left the young in a weak state and they
died off. Again within a few days the Mistle Thrushes started another
nest, this time on a sloping roof of about 50 degrees. Much material
fell to the ground and it was considered in the bird's interest to fix a 2 in.
batten to retain the nest which was 13 ft. up. It was also sheltered by
overhead cover and while exposed to view it was more or less an ideal site.
Again five eggs produced four young, all of which were reared. By this
time maggots were available and a few were taken to supplement the
natural supply of worms found in the aviary. It was intended to foster
out Mistle Thrushes under Song Thrushes but no nests were available
with young of a comparable age.
A pair of Fieldfares, together with two young partly hand-reared the
previous season, were housed with the Mistle Thrushes. A special study
was made of their behavipur, from late winter until the fruit tree foliage
made observations difficult. The Fieldfare proved awkward aviary
inmates, it being necessary to fix up individual feeding points for each bird.
Apples were spiked on branches and each bird guarded the area adjacent
to the food supply. Poultry pellets and Softbill food mixed was provided
in separate dishes placed up to 20 ft. apart. While the Mistle Thrushes
kept very much together and fed from the same spot, the most frequent
activity recorded was the continuous bickering between the Fieldfares.
With the coming of the breeding season it was of interest to record the
gradual reconciliation. The species is reported to be sociable in the wild,
nesting in colonies. From the limited observations made here there must
ae quite a lot of squabbling before the birds settle down. The cock
Fieldfare with tail erect, body leaning forward and wings dropped would
olerate the approach of the hen to within a foot or two. After a brief
iriel skirmish both birds would alight quite close together, the cock

puffed breast and tail up. While the birds were noisy when compared
with the Mistle Thrushes, no song was noted. A low warble was noted
from time to time. With the increase in the volume of the spring chorus
it was difficult to isolate individual efforts. The aviary shelter used as a
hide was surrounded by aviaries containing many different species. The
varied Starling's song with some mimicry, frequently added to the vocal
confusion. One rewarding moment of the many hours of observation
was the recording of the Tree Sparrow's weaver-like buzzing song and
dance as it displayed to its mate. The cock sparrow with both feet firmly
gripping the perch would draw himself up at an angle, leaning towards the
hen and with a swaying action emit a continuous unmusical song.
The Fieldfare's winter quarters were extended by opening up their
enclosure to the adjacent 80 ft. by 90 ft. compound. Normal practice is
to keep breeding pairs of the various species in the same enclosure all the
year round or in ad ; acent units from which they can freely enter without
having to resort to catching the birds up. Very few species are domestica-
ted sufficiently to tolerate the terrible experience of being manhandled,
certainly no British species. Unlike the Mistle Thrushes which went to
nest immediately on being introduced to the large planted enclosure, no
inclination to commence nesting was noted with the Fieldfares. It was
two months before nest building was noted; by this time the trees were in
full leaf. The nest was built in a fork of two five-inch branches with very
little screening. It was similar to a Blackbird's in shape but much more
straggly, some of the grasses draping down from the bulk of the nest.
The concave-shaped interior was more rounded than the flattish finish
of the Mistle Thrushes' nest, but not so deep as a Song Thrush's. The
five eggs resembled that of a Blackbird s but were about that of a Song
Thrush in size. When the young Fieldfares hatched it was necessary to
use a step ladder to inspect the nest and note the development of the birds.
Maggots supplemented the earthworms and other live food found by the
birds. One young was missing at an early age, less than 48 hours old.
Daily examinafions of the others indicated an early variation in their
development and another died about the fifth day. Of the three remaining
one gradually lost ground by the time the others left the nest and it was
never seen again. The two survivors made reasonable progress and addi-
tional feeding points were set up at ground level. At about a month after
fledging one of the young Fieldfares was found dead in a going-light con-
dition. The other was present when the annual round-up and roll call
was made in October. The Fieldfares broke into an early moult by the
end of July, ruling out the hope of a second round. The two-year-old
Fieldfares never made any attempt at nesting. In addition to the rings
they were distinguished from the parents, retaining some of the juvenile
spotting after the first moult. Only when the Fieldfares encroached into
the Mistle Thrush's nesting area was there any sign of pugnacious
activity. At the end of the 1968 season Mistle Thrushes, Purple-headed

Thrushes and Starlings were housed in three interconnecting aviaries
and the order of " peck " or dominance was as listed, Mistle Thrushes on
top with the native Starling last.
. r ^ wo P a * rs blackbirds, one in the 70 ft. by 70 ft. aviary and the other
in one 30 ft. by 100 ft., together with Song Thrushes and many finches,
reared two rounds each. Blackbirds are considered more difficult species
than Song Thrushes. There is, of course, no sexing problem. Hedge
Sparrows were able to raise young in the large enclosures without any
special care being offered. At least 100 square feet is provided and in
some cases over 300, when stocking large compounds, finches being the
most numerous.
Starlings, like the Hedge Sparrows, were left to fend for themselves.
They reared young in enclosures where the supply of maggots was
rationed, having to compete with Song Thrushes and Blackbirds. With
Starlings it has been noted on several occasions that incubation starts
before the clutch is complete, resulting in one or two younger chicks
having to compete with others hatched a day or two earlier. Under
perfect conditions with a plentiful supply of live food the complete brood
could be raised. However, with hole nesters any retarded young quickly
succumb and frequently they are left decaying in the nest. Early culling
of the young is desirable. The native Starling's neglect of nest hygiene
is all too apparent if the nest-box is examined after the young fledge.
On the other hand Glossy Starlings maintain a clean nest and continually
add bits of leaves as the young develop. On occasion half grown young
Glossys have been partly covered in the freshly added nesting material.
The breeding cycle of the native Starling seems a more or less continuous
affair. About a month after the young of the last round have fledged, the
cock bird will revisit the nest and spend quite a lot of time in subdued
song accompanied with wing flicking. This is repeated continually
throughout the winter and during mild spells the old nests are removed and
sometimes a few fresh grasses added. In the first week of February a
Starling laid a clutch of eggs. No doubt the abnormal mild weather in
January was a contributory factor. By the time the clutch was completed
arctic conditions returned and the hen did not sit.
There are several recordings over several seasons of young Song Thrushes
and Blackbirds " fostering " younger birds, offering them food and even
attempting to brood them. Young birds have been observed carrying
nesting material. Young Mistle Thrushes have been heard to utter
chattering calls before fledging. Where young Song Thrushes and
Blackbirds were mixed with young Mistle Thrushes losses have occurred
when the latter take up guard on the feeding dishes.
t( British bird breeders have everything to gain by concentrating on the
easier " to breed species. Many species are beyond the capability of
the breeders to establish domesticated strains. It is one thing to breed
from robust wild-caught stock and another to reproduce young of the
necessary stamina after several generations.

I was very interested in W. Collard s article on the breeding of the
Lilac-breasted Roller, Coracias caudata, in captivity in Natal ( Avicult .
Mag. 75 : 95-6). The editorial comment was that there appeared to be
no previous records of the species breeding in captivity. The word
" successfully " should have been added, for I mentioned with a few
details in the Keston breeding notes, for 1965&amp;quot;66 I believe, that we hatched
two young from, I suspect, a rather ancient but very tame hen, originally
procured from Peter Parrish, which fell immediately in love with a
magnificent cock that we had only had for a few months and which was
flown to us specially by a good friend in East Africa. The latter was to be
paired to one of these two tame Lilac-breasts we already had, and which I
had tried unsuccessfully to pair together over a couple of years; and it was
the only bird I could have positively identified as a cock on sight. Since
the sexes are identical in colouring and indulge in similar display beha-
viour, and are also solitary out of the breeding season, sexing them is
not easy.
Keeping two such birds in one aviary together, except for the brief
breeding period is just about impossible. I am talking about fit, healthy
birds, not newly-imported ones. They bicker and chivvy each other
constantly. I introduced the two birds we had to the recently-arrived
cock by putting him in a middle, larger compartment and opening up the
inter-connecting doors. Rollers are intelligent birds and it took one of
the two only thirty seconds before it flew through the door of the shelter,
through the bob-hole, and out into the flight to land next to a rather
surprised cock bird. Immediately she landed she postured for copulation
to take place. It was not successful straight away but did take place a few
minutes later,
I had already put in a chewed-up parakeet nestbox, which they took to
straight away. I didn't look into the nestbox at all, for the cock would get
very excitable, displaying vigorously with a display that is closely allied
to an aggressive territorial display and would end with him noisily chasing

the hen round the aviary if she came off too often. My opportunity came
later when I found the hen very dejected with bad head injuries. I took
her away and looked into the nest-box. To my surprise I found two healthy,
fat, nude youngsters. They were almost reptilian-looking and one was
several days older than the other, the oldest being about nine to ten days
old.
I naturally thought the quarrel was over who should feed the young ones
so left the cock with them. However, they were dead next day. The hen
never fully recovered from her beating-up, and I never had a chance to
try again.
The diet was maggots, mealworms, fresh mince-meat and locusts.
I sometimes gave them newts but individual birds would go on and off
certain foods for several weeks at a time. I imagine their natural diet is
subject to strong seasonal changes.

BREEDING OF THE EUROPEAN AVOCET IN
THE NEW YORK ZOOLOGICAL PARK
(Recurvirostra avosetta)

Delicate and graceful, the European Avocet Recurvirostra avosetta , has
always been popular and much sought after for avicultural collections.
The Bronx Zoo first exhibited this species in 1905, but not until the 1964
opening of a new exhibit for waterbirds, the Aquatic Bird House, was
there a really suitable place in the Zoo to keep and breed shorebirds of
any type. One display in the new building was designed to represent a
tropical marsh, with a series of shallow, mud-bottom waterways coursing
between small islands and flat bars of land, and surfaced with a lush
growth of aquatic plants, an ideal location to maintain avocets. Two
w r ere established there as soon as the exhibit was completed and more
were added as they became available. The flock had reached a total of
six specimens by the fall of 1968. Also living in the 9 metres wide by
8 metres deep, simulated habitat display are pairs or groups of: Chilean
Grebe Podiceps rolland chilensis , Sun-Bittern Eurypyga helias , Common
Jacana Jacana spinosa , Black-necked Stilt Himantopus mexicanus , African
Spur-winged Plover Vanellus spinosus , Greenshank Tringa nebidaria ,
White-winged Black Tern Chlidonias leucopterus , European Hoopoe Upupa
epops and African Grey-headed Kingfisher Halcyon leucocephala. On
1 5th April, of the current year (1969), a pair of European Avocets was
observed attempting to build a nest in an open situation near the middle
of the exhibit. Unfortunately, the site that they had chosen was only a
short distance away from an active, Black-necked Stilt, nest. The
stilts, tending a full clutch of eggs, were highly aggressive at this point,

They drove the avocets away. Stilts are regular breeders at the Zoo and
little difficulty is experienced in artificially hatching the eggs, or in hand-
rearing the young. The stilts were removed and their eggs placed in an
incubator. On 22nd April the avocets were seen building a new nest,
not far from the original site, and at 10 a.m. the following day an egg was
noted in their simple, water-weed lined scrape. Within half an hour the
egg disappeared from the nest and was subsequently found in the water,
broken. Common Jacanas were suspected of being the culprits for three
of them had been observed running back and forth over the nest site.
The Jacanas were also removed from the exhibit. The avocets third
attempt to nest was in a more fortunate location, protected by plantings
near the rear of the exhibit. Eggs were laid on 25th, 27th, 29th April
and 1 st May. Because of the previous disturbances, it was deemed wise
to remove part of the clutch for artificial incubation, as an insurance
measure. Two eggs were taken for this purpose but a mechanical failure
resulted in an early death for the embryos. The remaining eggs incubated
by both parents hatched on 22nd and 24th May respectively. The
chicks remained at the nest site until the younger of the two was fully
one day old. During the latter part of this period, however, the older
hatchling started to wander short distances away picking up, and some-
times eating, small mealworms tossed into the area. Within two days of
hatching, both of the chicks were feeding from the regular food dishes in
the exhibit. Both parents brooded the chicks repeatedly and became
increasingly aggressive towards the other birds in the display as the chicks
grew stronger and wandered over a wider area in the aviary. The
greatest amount of pressure was exerted against the non-breeding flock
of avocets. A tragedy was discovered on the morning of 29th May when
one of the chicks was found drowned in one of the deeper sections of the
pool. The remaining young avocet continued to thrive but the aggressive
nature of the parents become so intense that great concern was felt for
the welfare of the other birds in the exhibit. By 7th June the situation
had become so acute that it was necessary to make some move to alleviate
this pressure. The chick and one of the parents were removed to an
off-exhibit aviary where they settled easily and the young bird continued
to progress and grow. By the latter part of the month of July, the young
bird was fully as large as an adult and could only be distinguished on sight
by a faint, rust-coloured wash on the upper back. The juvenile and
parent were returned to the exhibit on 25th July and quickly settled down
with the rest of the avocet flock.
The first recorded captive breeding of the European Avocet took place
in Regent's Park, London, in the Spring of 1907. An excellent account
of that event appeared in the Avicultural Magazine (Vol. V, No. 9,
pp. 258-263) authored by Mr. R. I. Pocock, Superintendent of the
Zoological Gardens at that time. The authors felt, however, that captive
breedings of this species are rare and each occurrence worthy of a note,
recording details.

Hill Mynahs are becoming increasingly popular as pets, being justly
enowned for their talking ability. They have only very rarely been
)r ed in captivity, mainly because they are usually kept singly in cages,
rhe thousands imported annually into Europe and North America have
&amp;gt;een captured in the wild, the great majority of them in India. This
irticle describes the methods of capture of, and the subsequent trade
n, Hill Mynahs in different parts of India, the information given being
*ased on my own observations and enquiries during two years of field
york in India on the social and vocal behaviour of these birds. First,
lowever, the nomenclature and distribution of Hill Mynahs needs
larification.
Nomenclature
* n x 957 &amp;gt; E. J- Boosey reported in the Avicultural Magazine the
reeding of Greater Hill Mynahs at Keston Foreign Bird Farm. The
ubsequent confusion in later issues over the correct identity and nomen-
lature of the species bred was due largely to the use of old and disagreeing
fference books. Two recent authoritative works, Ripley (1961) and
eters (1962) have now clarified the nomenclature, and in this way super-
sded earlier reference works. I shall be dogmatic in order to be brief.
The terms Hill Mynah " and " Grackle " are synonymous for birds
f the genus Gracula\ the earlier generic name Eulabes is now outdated,
he name Grackle is best avoided since it leads to confusion with
ther unrelated Grackles. The word " Hill " must be included to avoid
infusion with other related genera also called Mynahs. Except for
racula ptilogenys endemic to Ceylon, all Hill Mynahs are at present
eated as races of the species Gracula religiosa; there are 10 such races,
&amp;gt;und in South-East Asia from India eastwards; the four main races are
salt with briefly below. (Although this is the classification of Hill
lynahs generally accepted at present, and is used in this article, study of
le behaviour and calls of these birds in the field and in captivity makes
clear that G. r. indica and G. r. intermedia would not interbreed if
teir ranges were to meet, and that they should therefore be considered
1 be distinct species.)
Gracula religiosa intermedia is the Greater Hill Mynah of the bird trade,
id the race of Hill Mynah by far the most commonly imported to this
&amp;gt;untry. It is the race bred by Boosey at Keston, and is found in Nepal,
orthern India (particularly Assam), Burma, Indo-China, and Thailand.

Gracula religiosa indica is the Lesser Hill Mynah of the bird trade,
less commonly imported into England, and found in south-west India
and Ceylon. It is easily distinguishable from G. r. intermedia by its
considerably smaller size, more slender build, and different wattle arrange-
ment, as illustrated in the accompanying photograph.
Gracula religiosa peninsularis is found only in north-east peninsulai
India, particularly in Orissa to the south-west of Calcutta. It differs from
G. r. intermedia really only in being slightly smaller.
Gracula religiosa religiosa is the Javan Hill Mynah of the bird trade
relatively rarely imported into this country, and distributed through
Malaya, Sumatra, Java, Borneo and some of the nearby islands. It is
considerably larger than G. r. intermedia.
The six other races of Gracula religiosa have restricted island distribu-
tions and are virtually never imported into England.

Methods of Capture
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979080142857143" page_id="58089703"  page_num="254" year="" vol="">
In South India, Hill Mynahs of the race indica are captured in larg&amp;lt;
numbers with nets or bird lime when large flocks gather to feed on loca
concentrations of fruit or nectar. Most of the indica so taken are adul
birds, which rarely become very tame and which are largely unable t&amp;lt;
learn new sounds. As pointed out by Ali (1963) this method of capture
taking adult birds, is probably the main reason for the poor reputatioi
of the Lesser Hill Mynah as a talking bird. A few young indica are take]
from the nest before fledging, are kept locally, and learn to talk quite well
but since adult indica are cheaper and easier to obtain, they are ofte
substituted by dishonest dealers. In consequence, indica have acquire*
the reputation of being unable to learn to imitate human speech, an
therefore they command lower prices.
In North India, Greater Hill Mynahs (i.e. the race intermedia) ar
occasionally captured when adult by some of the hill peoples. Stick
coated with bird lime are attached to trees just coming into fruit, and tb
winter flocks of Hill Mynahs land on these and become entangled. A
the birds so caught used to be eaten--curried Hill Mynah is apparent!
a Naga delicacy. Recently, however, the bird dealers in India ha\
discovered that if they buy cheaply these wild-caught adult intermedi
(and, sometimes, trim the wattles of these unfortunate birds), they ca
often pass them off as expensive young birds to those ignorant of th
differences between adults and young or ignorant of the need to obtain
young bird if it is to be taught to talk.
The great majority of intermedia captured are taken from nests up to
fortnight before fledging. Most of these nests are in high tree holes, i
some cases artificial basket nests are used, as described in an earlier artic
(Bertram 1968). These young birds gape widely, and are easily fed t
hand. In India only a diet of moistened gram-powder is used. To indue

neat or live food would improve the health and appearance of these
)irds, but would be more expensive to the dealers, and is never done.
The young birds reach Calcutta two or three weeks after capture, and are
:hen sent abroad by air, usually fairly soon since the demand for them
s high, particularly at the beginning of the breeding season. In the wild,
greater Hill Mynahs fledge between April and September, and are
ndependent of their parents very soon after. In captivity, if fed by hand,
hey will continue for months to gape for food; thus a " gaper " bought in
anuary has not come straight from the nest.
Crates of young Greater Hill Mynahs converge on the big Calcutta
)ird market from the following three main districts. From Assam
mainly from the Garo Hills District) come about 5,000 young intermedia
&amp;gt;er year. From Nepal, along the border with India, come annually
bout 1,200 young intermedia. From Orissa, south-west of Calcutta,

The numbers of indica captured probably have almost no effect on the

(The Nature Conservancy, Blackhall, Banchory, Kincardineshire, Scotland)
People often rear red grouse and ptarmigan in captivity with varying
success. At the Nature Conservancy at Banchory in Kincardineshire,
we receive a number of requests for advice on rearing each year. To meet
these requests, I have written this article which summarizes our experien-
ces in rearing grouse over the last ten years and ptarmigan over several
years.
Eggs
To rear red grouse and ptarmigan, you usually have to get eggs from
wild birds. To get warm eggs back off the hill we use a large thermos
flask filled with wheat at 99 0 F (37 0 C). We actually take the wheat out
at a slightly higher temperature than this and allow it to cool off when we
are picking up the eggs, using a thermometer to get the correct temperature.
The chances of success in rearing vary enormously and depend mainly
on the quality of the clutches you happen to have picked up. Although
the hatchability of eggs from wild birds is usually over 90%, the viability
of the chicks varies a lot. This variation in the chicks apparently depends
on the state of the hen which laid a particular clutch. If the food (heathei
in the case of red grouse) which she was eating when she laid the eggs was
of good nutritive value then the eggs are likely to be of good quality and the
chicks hatching from them will survive well. But if the heather was poor
either badly browned over the winter or late in growing during spring
then many of the chicks from that clutch will probably die.
These differences in egg quality are the major reason for differences ir
the breeding production of wild grouse and ptarmigan in different years
and at different moors. In our experience, one extreme was shown b}
eggs from a hill in the Cairngorms where we take an interest in the
ptarmigan. In 1968 the ptarmigan in the wild failed to rear any youn#
at all, which was unusually poor breeding, and we managed to rear #
quarter of the chicks that hatched from three clutches of eggs taken nearby
At the other extreme, we reared all the chicks hatched from a clutch of
a grouse moor where breeding was good in 1959- We have seen al
intermediate stages also. Thus if chicks die inside a fortnight aftei
hatching, and a post mortem shows no evidence of disease, then there if
probably nothing that could have been done to save them. They wen
foredoomed before they hatched. It is a good thing to be aware of this
point, as it saves unnecessary discouragement and self-recrimination.
We have found this difference between eggs of good and poor qualit)
in Scottish ptarmigan and red grouse. In Iceland, wild ptarmigan nearly

always rear large broods, and heavy mortality in the first 1-2 weeks is
therefore unlikely to occur with chicks from Icelandic eggs. This may be
because of the known fact that the food of Icelandic ptarmigan is of better
nutritive value than the food eaten by Scottish ptarmigan. We do not
know whether North American and European ptarmigan are of Scottish
type or Icelandic type in their food and chick survival.
Hatching
Still-air incubators are quite good for hatching eggs which are already
far on in incubation, say two weeks or more of the full three-week period.
However, we have not had very good results using fresh eggs in still-air
incubators. I understand that forced-draught incubators are quite
satisfactory, but we use bantams, which are more convenient for small
batches of eggs that are all at different stages of incubation.
To bring out chicks in a still-air incubator, we always make sure there
is plenty of moisture. Grouse eggs require more moisture than chicken
eggs and we add extra water trays to bring the surface area of water inside
the incubator up to at least twice the amount provided by the manufac-
turer. We have found it impossible to make a still-air incubator too moist.
According to the instructions issued by some manufacturers, the usual
still-air incubators are designed to run at a relative humidity of 70%.
But when the humidity in them is actually measured, it turns out to be
30% or less, depending on the weather at the time. Even if the surround-
ing air is quite moist, the rise in temperature inside the incubator itself
lowers the relative humidity, in spite of the water trays provided as part of
the incubator. However, a relative humidity of 30% will hatch hens'
eggs and 40% is quite adequate for grouse eggs.

Although a good clutch of chicks will survive almost any method of
rearing, the number of poorer chicks which survive depends on the care
you give in rearing. The best method is to use Calor gas brooders and
I shall describe this in detail below, but it is rather expensive. You can
also rear grouse using a bantam hen. The disadvantages are that not all
bantams are good mothers and that the bantam may be a carrier of a
disease which kills the chicks. It is also possible to rear grouse using an
infra-red brooder, but this provides only a small circle of heat in the
middle of the brooder house. This is good enough if you have lively
chicks from eggs of good quality, but poorer chicks often seem to be
lethargic or stupid and will crouch in a corner of the brooder house, and
get chilled away from the heat. You will not have this trouble with Calor
gas brooders, which give more uniform heat all over the floor area. To
rear chicks we use light, steel-framed aluminium-cladded brooder houses,
with a polystyrene lining on the lower half of the walls for insulation.

There is a " claritex " window in the roof and on the front of the
house and a wire-covered window at the back which is provided
with shutters. We use this wire-covered window to watch the chicks'
behaviour, so it is not a necessary feature of the house. The floor is of
wire mesh on a removable wooden frame, consisting of a double layer of
J-in. wire mesh for the first two weeks. The double layer prevents the
chicks getting their legs caught in the wire in the first two weeks, but as
they get older it begins to get clogged with droppings and so is changed
to a single layer. About 20 birds can be reared in such a house, with
a ten-foot square run attached. We usually keep the chicks inside the
house for about ten days before letting them out into the run through a
pophole in the side of the brooder house.
Heat is provided for six weeks using a Maywick pheasant brooder which
runs off propane gas. It is wise to use a regulator including a two-way
switch connected to a reserve cylinder as well as to the supply cylinder.
This automatically switches over to the reserve cylinder when the supply
cylinder runs out, and keeps the brooder going.
Turkey starter, pheasant starter and partridge starter are all perfectly
good foods for young grouse. However, you should avoid foods which use
meat and bone meal as a source of protein--on one occasion we used a

turkey starter containing this and the chicks hardly grew at all for two
weeks.
. ^icks sometimes do not learn quickly enough to feed if the food is
srniply given m a feeding tray. A good way to get them started feeding is
to sprinkle the light-coloured food over a dark surface, such as a dark-
coloured sod of upturned peat. The contrast in colour seems to attract
the chicks to peck at the food, and they soon learn to eat it.
It is essential to give some green food. Heather is best, but if this is
not available, some other green food will do, though not so well. For the
first ten days, whilst the chicks are confined to the brooder house, they
are given sods of heather. Then they are let out into the run which is set
up on short heather. This is moved twice a week, on to gradually taller
heather as the birds get older.
Feather-pecking can be a problem, especially if the birds are allowed to
remain on short vegetation as they get bigger. You can reduce feather-
pecking by providing cover, such as longer heather or, if this is not possible,
cut branches. The proprietary preparation " Curb " is effective in
inhibiting feather-pecking, but must be applied before the habit becomes
really well-established.
Whatever system is used, hygiene and cleanliness are essential, as in
a husbandry. The biggest killing disease in our experience is cocci-
diosis, to which grouse seem to be much more susceptible than ptarmigan.
This trouble usually strikes when the birds are aged three weeks or more,
well past the stage of early deaths due to poor-quality eggs. Fortunately&apos;
coccidiosis may be cured by the drugs on sale for this disease in poultry.'
A disadvantage of the sulpha drugs commonly used for treating coccidiosis
is the fact that they tend to damage the birds' kidneys. However, new
drugs that are now available do not have this disadvantage, and in future
we intend to add one of them to the birds' water as a matter of routine,
because we have been troubled by coccidiosis in every year without
exception.
Breeding in Captivity
Once the birds are full-grown, they can easily be kept in captivity, and
vill lay fertile eggs. We use cages of the sort illustrated in the
Iiagram, but almost any reasonably draughtproof cage which has as much
)r more floor space, and enough cover to allow the hen to hide from the
&apos;*ck will probably do. We prefer to keep the birds on wire, to make
leaning easier and prevent disease. We feed the adult birds Grouse
Maintenance Pellets, which are made by Ranks, for most of the year, and
Arouse Breeders' Pellets from mid-March to the end of June. They do
&amp;gt;etter if they are given a small amount of heather; a good way of doing this
s to bundle up a handful of heather with an elastic band and hang it from
he side of the cage. One bundle every two days is enough. When the

birds are laying, we also give them limestone or shell grit as well as the
usual quartz or granite grit.
The birds usually begin to lay in late April or early May and a typical
hen will lay 20-30 eggs if each egg is removed the day it is laid. We
usually remove the eggs like this, but on several occasions we have provided
grouse with nesting material and plenty of cover and find that they will
hatch and rear a clutch of eggs with no trouble. In fact they make better
mothers than the bantams, largely because they speak the same language as
the chicks. We have not done this with hen ptarmigan, but I can see no
reason why it should not be successful.
Our limited experience of ptarmigan indicates that they do better in
captivity than grouse. We usually lose a few grouse over the winter and
many hens succumb to egg peritonitis in the laying season. The peri-
tonitis appears to have been getting more frequent as our breeding stock
becomes further removed from its wild origins. However, out of eighteen
ptarmigan we reared in 1968, only one died over winter and all ten hens
laid and survived the breeding season.
One of the main problems with breeding grouse in spring is that cock
birds get very aggressive, and may peck the hens to death. This is because
the hens are unable to escape from the cock in the cages, as they would in
the wild. Also, we may be pairing incompatible birds--say an aggressive
cock with a timid hen. We provide small shelters consisting of a foot-square
piece of plywood leaning against the side of the cage and plenty of cover

so that the hen can hide and avoid attacks of the cock. If she is out of
sight when he is feeling aggressive he does not try to seek her out. We
sometimes reduce damage by sharing one cock between two hens on
alternate days by shooing the cock through the pophole in the breeding
cages each day. Sometimes the cock will severely damage one hen and
leave the other alone. If other methods fail, the cock can be inhibited
from pecking the hen by mild " de-beaking "--clipping his upper man-
dible so that the blood just flows. This may have to be repeated once or
twice as his bill grows again. In 1969 only one of our cock ptarmigan
attacked a hen, and he stopped when his beak was clipped.

Eggs From Captive Birds
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99947324137931" page_id="58089710"  page_num="261" year="" vol="">
We have been hatching eggs from 20-30 captive grouse each year for
four years now, and did so on a smaller scale in previous years. Many of
our breeding birds are therefore four generations or more removed from
the original wild stock.
I said earlier that the quality of eggs from the wild varies a great deal,
depending on the nutritive value of the food eaten by the hen that laid
them. It might appear from this that breeding birds in captivity ought
to lay eggs of good quality every year, because they get plenty of good food.
At first the breeding results were encouraging and supported this view.
Despite a fairly poor hatchability of 70%, due mostly to clear eggs, 80%
of the chicks which hatched survived in 1966. Hatchability remained
fairly constant at 70% from 1966 to 1968, but fell to 40% in 1969. The
survival of the chicks after hatching fell from 80% in 1966 to 70% in 1967,
50/o in 1968, and 60% in 1969. I understand that a similar decrease in
vigour occurs when breeding stocks of partridges and pheasants are kept
in captivity. Although poor grouse eggs may be produced in the wild
because the hen's food is of poor quality, this does not appear to be the
reason in captivity, where we give food of high quality all the time. We do
not know the reason in captivity, but there is a slight indication that the
cocks, rather than the hens, may be at fault. In 1967 we took in a few
wild eggs and in 1968 bred from two hens hatched from these eggs, mating
them with cocks from the captive stock. Chicks hatched out from the
eggs of these hens survived just as poorly as the rest of the captive stock--
thus performing like their father's stock and not like their mother's.
I have now described the complete breeding cycle, and I wish you luck
in your rearing. Unfortunately, I must end on an unhelpful note by
saying that we are unable to help anybody by providing eggs for rearing
purposes. This is because we use for research purposes all the eggs our
birds lay, and have no surplus for general distribution.

(Saroglossa spiloptera)
By Mrs. K. M. Scamell (Newdigate, Surrey)
The Spotted-winged Stare, Saroglossa spiloptera , is a species of Starling
about 9J in. in length. The adult male is very dark-brownish-grey above
with black markings. The wings have a band of white patches across the
flight feathers which are pointed and black. Cheek patches aie dark
grey-brown and the chin and throat are deep chestnut rufous. The chest
is reddish-white as are the sides of the belly and the remainder of the
underparts are white. The eye is yellow with a dark brown iris. The
beak and legs are grey-black. The centre tail feathers are grey-black
and the outer tail feathers dark brown. The adult hen is dark brown
above with black and dark grey markings. The wings also carry a band
of white patches across the flight feathers which are pointed and blackish-
brown. Cheek patches are brown and the chin, throat and chest are
whitish streaked with brown. The underparts are mostly whitish except
near the wings where they are greyish with a little fulvous. Eyes, beak
and legs are similar to the male's, but the centre tail feathers are dark brown
and the outer ones medium brown.
The species has been recorded up to 5,000 ft. elevation and distribution
is said to be throughout the Himalayas and also in Annam and S.W. China.
It is an erratic winter visitor to Burma as far South as the Southern Shan
States. Breeding has been recorded in the Himalayas from Mandi, in
Himachel Pradesh, to Nepal. The species is said to be gregarious and
particularly fond of flower nectar. It is also frugivorous and eats insects.
It has a wild twisting flight which occurs without apparent reason and as
suddenly finishes. The nesting sites are found in tree hollows or old
barbet's holes, 20 to 30 ft. up and the eggs are usually three or four in
number and coloured pale blue with reddish-brown specks and blotches.
We purchased our pair of Spotted-winged Stares from a Southall dealer
on June 5th, 1967. They had been imported two or three weeks and were
in fair condition. The species are not often available in the U.K. and we
could not recall having seen them before. They were given an aviary
to themselves and during the following winter moved to another aviar\
with a shelter heated to 45 0 F. They are very simple feeders and contrary
to the records of their feeding in the wild, they ate only insectivorous food
with the minimum of fruit, just a little grated apple and grated carrot.
They are not greedy birds but they are very shy, and have a high-pitched
screech when flying. They ignored live food and nectar.
After we had had the birds 12 months, they suddenly became very excited,
flying wildly and calling to each other. We felt that at last they might be
in breeding condition. Nest-boxes, both with half-open fronts and with
entrance holes only, had been provided in various positions in the flight

which is planted with evergreens and measures 16 ft. long x 4 ft. widex
6 ft. 6 in. high. The shelter measures 4 ft. long x 2 ft. wide by 7 ft. 6 in.
high to the ridge and also had a nest-box. The aviary is the first one of a
block of six. Mealworms, maggots and nectar were offered from time to
time but were ignored. A week later the hen was missing for long periods
and we thought she might be nesting inside the shelter. This was not so
and the remainder of the wet summer passed with no nesting attempt.
As before, the birds moulted in late October and spent the second winter
in their aviary but shut in the shelter at night and during daytime frosts.
In the Spring of 1969 we added two further nest-boxes, one in the flight
and one replacing the one in the shelter, about 6 ft. up. Each box has a
sloping roof and measures 10 in. high x 7 in. deep x 6 in. wide and has a
2 4 in. diameter entrance hole over a perch. Live food was offered from
time to time as was nectar, but always refused. In early June the pair
were very active and in very fine condition and on the 16th June to our
surprise the mealworms and maggots were all consumed for the first time
since we possessed the birds. On the 23rd June fresh privet leaves were
seen in the shelter under the new nest-box. Live food was fed twice daily
and was all consumed, but little insectivorous food was eaten. The hen
bird was rarely seen and on the 3rd July the cock was seen in the flight
with something white in its beak and we now felt fairly sure that one or
more chicks had hatched. Live food disappeared quickly. On the 9th
July I just had to know if there were any young in the nest so when both
birds weie in the flight my husband stood on a box but was unable to see
anything through the nest hole. However something like a beak jabbed
gently at his finger and we were at last satisfied that at least one young bird
was inside! The 12th July was very hot, about 8o* F. The hen was
seen to chase the cock in the flight so that it clung to the wire netting.
Even so it managed to get into the shelter and possibly do its share of
feeding! Shortly afterwards the nest was again checked, this time using
a torch. One young bird was seen, quite large and mostly naked. The
nest consisted of a pad of leaves covering the whole floor of the box, but
no other material. Mealworms and gentles were fed six times during the
day, also some earthworms, but the latter were not touched and very little
insectivorous food was eaten. The last feed was given at 9 p.m. but at
7.30 a.m. next morning all the live food had gone. The temperature
remained in the 8o's until the 17th July when it dropped to 72 0 F. Live
food consumption had remained fairly constant until the latter date when
at 1.30 p.m. some mealworms remained from the two morning feeds.
This was unusual as they normally consumed the mealworms first. There
was also a bad smell in the shelter, the sort that bird breeders dread as it
indicates the death of something, so especting the worst the nest was
again checked by torchlight. T. wo young birds were seen alive and almost
fully fledged. This was a great relief. Two days later we saw the body
of a young Stare in the shelter where it had been deposited from the nest.

264 MRS. K. M. SCAMELL--BREEDING THE SPOTTED-WINGED STARE
It had been dead many days and was only partially fledged. To be sure a
further check on the nest-box was made and this time my husband saw
two very lively young birds moving around the box. Their tails were
over an inch long and they were so active that it seemed they were ready
to leave the nest. Both parents had been seen to deposit faeces in the
flight.
During the next three days many of the mealworms supplied were
mutilated in the food pot and mostly maggots only seemed to have been
fed. The weather had become very hot again and early on the 26th July
the first young Stare was seen in the flight. It was completely feathered
and in colour was a dull edition of its mother. The second young bird
was in the flight a few hours later. This bird was darker and carried more
rufous on the chest and at the sides so we felt sure we had a young bird of
each sex. The birds were strong and could fly well. In fact the young
hen returned to its nest during the afternoon and was not seen again that
day. The young cock stayed out and as far as we knew was perched on
the flight all night which was dry and warm; 23 days had elapsed since
we suspected that hatching had occurred, but as we never found any
eggshells, the birds might be a few days younger. The next day the
birds were in the flight most of the time, calling to be fed. They were
very steady and the parents were less shy than usual and we were able to
observe them feed live food on several occasions. It rained all night on
the 28th July and all the next day with the temperature ranging between
62* F. and 48* F. The young birds were unaffected by the weather
and never seemed to get really wet. They rarely go on the ground and
I think this helps with young birds facing their first heavy rainstorm.
At 8 a.m. on the 30th July all the insectivorous food had been eaten
though there was live food still in the food pot. This was unusual as with
softbills I generally have to restrict the live food before they will accept
the insectivorous food. My diary for the 2nd August records, " Young
Stares clamouring for food nearly all day. Both parents seen to feed only
occasionally and the young birds are flying wildly and no longer enter the
shelter. The following evening at about 8 p.m. the young birds were
crying for food as usual but this time the parents seemed very excited,
forcing one of the young birds to the ground." Though as far as we knew
this was only the 9th day since the birds had left the nest, it seemed that the
time had come to separate them from their parents. We caught the young
birds up and caged them in the house for the night. They did not eat
any of the food provided, so next morning we moved them to a large cage
in one of the birdrooms well out of sight and, we hoped, hearing of the
parents who seemed about to nest again. In a very little while the young
Stares were feeding themselves with insectivorous food, a little grated
apple and carrot and a few mealworms. They don't touch maggots.
New leaves were seen on the shelter floor but as far as we know the
parent hen did not lay again nor was she absent from the flight long

enough to incubate. Mealworms provided for the parents were again
mutilated but gentles had been eaten freely. By the 20th September it
seemed unlikely they would breed again this year so we placed the young
Stares in a nearby aviary. As at the 6th October 1969 neither the parents
or the young birds have moulted and the plumage of the latter seems
unchanged since they left the nest. It is as follows:
The juvenile male has a dark-brown head with the back a lighter brown,
particularly at the edges of some of the feathers. The upper tail-coverts
are reddish-brown and the tail is dark brown. The wings carry a similar
white bar to those of the parents and the flight feathers are black. The
chin and throat are whitish with dark brown streaks. The underparts are
also whitish mixed with fulvous at the sides of the chest and belly and
around the vent. The beak and legs are similar to the parents but the
eyes are grey with dark irides.
The juvenile hen has a medium brown head with dark brown face
patches, a lighter brown back and dark brown tail. Chin and throat are
whitish streaked with brown. The wing flight feathers are dark brown
and carry similar white bars to those of the parents. Underneath the
bird is whitish with a little fulvous showing on the sides of the belly and
around the vent. The legs and beak are similar to those of the juvenile
cock but the eyes are unlike the parents or the juvenile cock, they seem to
be a darkish-brown with a suspicion of a lighter circle around the irides.

BREEDING THE INDIAN BLUE CHAT
(Luscima brunnea brunnea )

<bodyText confidence="0.9812622" page_id="58089716"  page_num="265" year="" vol="">
By Mrs. K. M. Scamell (Newdigate, Surrey)
The Indian Blue Chat, Luscinia brunnea , is distributed throughout the
Himalayas during the summer months from May to September. The
species winters mainly in the rainfall zone of S.W. India and Ceylon at
elevations of between 2,500 and 5,000 ft.
Breeding occurs only in the Himalayas between 5,000 and 10,000 ft.
and from May to October. The Indian Blue Chat is not easily seen in its
native habitat because it spends its life among low dense bushes, in the
undergrowth and on the ground. It is said to be a confirmed skulker.
In an aviary, however, the adult birds though generally on the ground do

frequently perch for long periods and are easier to observe. When in
breeding condition the male bird has a short distinctive song comprising
three or four " peeps " each louder than the last and followed by a few
sweet notes, all of which carry quite a distance. At such times the bird
is perched on a high branch or perch in its aviary.
The sexes are not alike. The male bird is dark or slatey-blue above
with a very noticeable white supercilium. The sides of the head are blue-
black. A large white streak crosses the throat and leads to the point of
the chin. The remainder of the underparts are bright chestnut except
the abdomen which is whitish. The female is olive-brown above and
fulvous below with a lighter patch at the throat and abdomen.
Male Indian Blue Chats are often imported into the U.K. but females
are scarcer and the one we have is the only one I can ever recall having
seen. We purchased our pair in London in November 1967. They were
very young birds. We already had a cock bird and really only wanted
the hen but the owner would not separate so we came away with the pair.
They were given a large cage for the rest of the winter and lived together
amicably. The food given was our normal insectivorous food plus a
small daily ration of mealworms and gentles. Their general condition
improved steadily so that on March 22nd 1968, we were able to move
the pair to a new planted aviary which had a heated shelter. It was one
of a range of six similar aviaries each flight measuring 12 ft. x 3 ft. x 6 ft.
6 in. high. The insulated cedarwood shelter for the six flights measures
18 ft. wide x 7 ft. 6 in. high x 3 ft. deep. The six compartments are
separated by wire netting partitions and have half-glazed doors leading to
the flights. Entrance holes above the doors can be closed by hinged
alighting platforms and there is a communicating door between each flight.
Lighting is controlled by a time switch, and tubular heaters, thermostati-
cally controlled, keep the shelter from falling below 45 F. In the rather
narrow flights of these six aviaries we have planted mature shrubs such as
privet, box, cupressus and lonicera with an odd bamboo and azalea
here and there. Pruning has to be frequent and quick in the breeding
season.
It was cool and wet during most of the 1968 summer. The cock bird
soon came into breeding condition and his song was heard day after day
but the hen was not interested. Most of the time she was puffed out and I
had doubts whether she would become established. In September they
both moulted and by the next month she became so aggressive to the cock
that I had to separate them, leaving the hen in her aviary for the winter and
caging the cock in a birdroom. In February 1969 the hen was carrying
dead leaves to first one then another of a number of half-open nest-boxes
we had placed in the flight and shelter. These " nests " did not get
beyond pads of leaves. In early March we tried to pair the birds again
but the hen would not accept her mate of the previous year. The
adjacent aviary was empty so the cock bird was hastily ushered into safety.

MRS. K. M. SCAMELL--BREEDING THE INDIAN BLUE CHAT 267
We next tried our old male which had been a bachelor some years but he
received the same treatment from the hen and had to be returned to his
winter cage. During a fine spell of weather in April we opened the
door between the two flights giving the pair the run of the two aviaries.
This time the pair agreed and we observed no fighting. The hen soon
resumed her nesting activities.
In the wild the species nests on or near the ground and we expected
her to choose one of the many nest-boxes placed low down in both flights
and shelters. She again carried leaves first to one box, then after a day
or two changed her mind. However on the nth May, to our surprise,
she chose a nest-box in the cocks' aviary which was fastened to the roof of
the flight and left there from the previous season when we had other
occupants in that aviary. She was soon carrying masses of teased string
and twine to her latest choice of a site so we shut the door of the flight
and confined the pair to the one aviary. The first egg was laid on the
20th May in a very deep and large cup at the back of the nest-box and
incubation commenced on the 24th May when either three or four eggs
had been laid. The cock sang at intervals throughout the long days.
Extra mealworms were given on the 3rd and 4 th June and when she was
off the nest for a few moments on the latter day I checked it and just felt
two small chicks. On the 6th June the cock was seen sparring with the hen
who seemed very disturbed so we put him in the adjacent empty aviary
where the hen had wintered and let the hen get on with the feeding alone.
The cock sang just the same! The next day I was able to check the nest
again and this time I thought there were three chicks. Shortly afterwards
the hen was seen to feed a maggot and then a long thin earthworm. The
young birds could be heard quite plainly but the only food which increased
was mealworms. On the nth June two heads were seen above the nest,
with beaks gaping. The weather had become very hot--around 75 *F_
during the last few days, with the sun beating down on the unprotected
roof of the nest-box and we began to wonder if the young birds would
survive this heat. In the wild, nesting is stated to occur low down and
ilways in shady places so no more unsuitable site could have been chosen.
We were also at fault in leaving the box in such a position. On the 13th
[une the hen did not seem to be feeding much live food so we added small
.arthworms and a few spiders to the food pot. Later that morning when
entering the flight with more earthworms, loud protests from both parents
Irew attention to a partly fledged bird on the ground. The hen was shut
n the shelter for a few moments and the bird was returned to the nest.
\.t 9 p.m. when the last of the earthworms were taken in, two heads were
igain seen above the nest.
The next day was again very hot and late that morning a young bird
vas again seen scrambling under the shrubs in the flight. This time the
Jarents wishes were respected and we left the bird alone. In the afternoon
he young bird was seen lying on a stone slab exposed to the hot sunshine.

It was placed in the shelter in the shade. Though the parents made the
usual protests, the hen made no attempt to feed it nor did she visit the
nest, so at 6 p.m. the nest was examined. Inside was one dead chick only
partly fledged. I felt sure it was one of the two alive the previous evening.
The bird in the shelter was now gaping weakly and as it seemed certain
that it had been abandoned by its mother it was removed to the house and
hand-fed with mealworms. Later these were supplemented with a
well-moistened strained insectivorous food using a Thomas's feeder.
The avian* was searched in case there were any more chicks but none were
found so the door between the two flights was opened and the pair once
again had the run of the two aviaries.
We hand fed the sun&apos;iving young bird for the next 12 days, when it
apparently caught its claw in a cage wire and lost a lot of blood before we
found what had happened. It died that night. We had become very
attached to the little bird which had completely feathered, was stronger
and could fly short distances but due to a weakness in one leg could not
stand properly. Perhaps the hen knew best as I doubt if it would have
ever overcome this defect.
In the meantime the hen had repaired her old nest before we had got
round to removing it. Then to our relief she abandoned it in favour of a
nest-box in the shelter of her winter aviary. It was about 2 ft. 6 in. from
the floor, faced east and was already half full of leaves. A large deep
cup was built as before and four pale blue eggs were laid, the first about
the 19th June. Incubation commenced on the 22nd June and one chick
hatched on the 5th July (14 days). The next day there were two chicks
End the day following these could be seen gaping. It was not until
I looked again on the 10th July did I see that all the eggs had hatched and
that there were four chicks in the nest. They were taking mealworms in
quantity, a few gentles, but I doubt if any insectivorous food was eaten
at all. It is always easier to succeed with a full clutch but I felt that a diet
of mealworms alone would not rear healthy birds. With softbills a
varied live food diet is essential. We had a culture of wax moths in a
heated cupboard but they were not ready. There were no caterpillars
about so it was back to the earthworms! We also obtained some white
worms from a local fish farm. The earthworms quickly disappeared, the
white worms more slowly. The next day was even hotter (80* F.) but
the shelter door which faced south was kept shut and the nest was in
shade. Sixty small earthworms were dug up, washed and supplied at
intervals. All were consumed. A friend brought a large supply of ant
eggs and these quickly disappeared, but whether they were hidden by the
ants which came with them or fed to the young birds I was not quite sure.
On the 14th July it was 84* F., and my husband found it hard digging to
find 100 earthworms which were now supplied in five lots each day.
The earthworms, small and red, were found coiled up in pockets in the
baked ground (heavy clay!) which was at the side of our orchard and which

was chosen as the source of supply because it had never been dug before
to our knowledge. It was free of any fertilisers and pesticides. On the
16th July (the 12th day since the first chick had hatched), the four young
birds left the nest, two in the morning and two in the afternoon. The
perching in the shelter had been added to by a number of thin branches
placed on the floor. The door was kept shut and we guessed rightly that
I it would be some days before they could fly as high as the open pophole.
Feeding was a bit of a problem as we liked to place the food on the floor
so that they would learn to feed themselves. Every time the door w 7 as
opened the four birds dived at the half-inch partition netting and stuck
their heads through. I felt sure they w r ould strangle themselves but other
than scraping some of the feathers off their heads they came to no harm.
Another 100 earthworms plus the usual mealworms and gentles w r ere fed
 |on each of the next three days and then reduced to nothing by the 21st
July. By that time the ground was baked so hard it v~as very difficult
to fork the ground at all and even more difficult to break up the&amp;quot; lumps of
: 1 a} ! The young birds w T ere now finding their v r ay out of the pophole
nto the flight so we fastened the shelter door back. One bird seemed
smaller than the other three but all had grown since leaving the nest and
vere flying strongly. On the 28th and 29th July the w eather at last broke,
here was a big drop in temperature and we had nearly 2 in. of rain.
Fhe first experience of rain did not seem to affect the four birds who kept
0 the bushes and hardly seemed to get wet. We separated one of them
&amp;gt;n 3*th Juh (14 days after leaving the nest), caged it and gave it a pot
vith insectivorous food, 12 gentles and three mealworms. It ate the live
ood first and then a little of the insectivorous. The live food was repeated
ind by the following morning much of the insectivorous food had gone as
veil as the li\ e food. That day the other three were caught up, separately
aged and fed in a similar way with similar results. The parents hardly
nade a protest and at that time it looked as if they w r ould nest again but
nstead started to moult within a few 7 days. The live food to the four
oung birds w as steadily reduced so that the other food w^as consumed in
quantity. On the 7th August two of the birds were given an empty aviary 7
dth a large shelter and the following day the remaining two joined them,
.hey all feed from one pot in the shelter, very often perch high up and
ave come along very w 7 ell indeed. They are no longer so w 7 ild but one
as to check tv ice a day to find if they are all there as one or two are always
1 the bushes.
From the coloration at this stage (20th August) there appears to be
iree hens and one cock. The young hens are brown above with greyish
eads. The w ings and tails are also brown with the edges of the feathers
ghter. The brown chests are streaked with grey and a lighter throat
atch show r s clearly. The sides of the chest are fulvous w 7 ith the remainder
f the underparts lighter. The young cock, however, has a slatey-blue
til and darker blue wing feathers, is much whiter underneath v 7 ith less

Recent news of the Pheasant Trust was given in a newsletter received
in September.
At a meeting of the Trust council in April it was decided that the name
should be changed from the " Ornamental Pheasant Trust " to the
" Pheasant Trust ", since it was felt that the former was rather misleading
insofar as all pheasants are ornamental, and further tended to create in the
minds of the general public a false impression as to the functions and aims
of the Trust. It was felt that the new name would be less cumbersome
and more appropriate.
The breeding season of 1969 had been remarkably successful except in
the case of the tragopans of which only three Cabot's and one Temminck's
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.731793666666667" page_id="58089723"  page_num="270" year="" vol="">
had been reared. Some of the more important results included the rearing
of a total of 140 Mikado, 38 Monal, 19 Koklass, 12 Green Junglefowl,
45 Cheer and 7 Edwards's Pheasants. The number of Mikados was
especially gratifying in view of the fact that at the end of 1968 there were
probably not more than 120 birds of this species in captivity in the world.
Since the beginning of the year the Trust had imported:
2/1 Siamese Firebacks, Lophura diardi ,
--/3 Green Junglefowl, Galius varius,
1/1 Malay Crestless Firebacks, Lophura e. erythrophthalma.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996022636363636" page_id="58089723"  page_num="270" year="" vol="">
The female Green Junglefowl were received from Dr. K. C. Searle ol
Hongkong and had already been mated with the three males which he
had sent last year. As can be seen from the list of breedings above, two
pairs nested successfully, the first time that this species has bred in the
Trust's collection. The Malay Crestless Firebacks were most generously
donated by Lord and Lady Medway and have settled down well, the female
laying two eggs while in quarantine. The species has never before been
represented in the Trust's collection.
Following the first successful release by the Trust of Swinhoe's Pheasanl
in Taiwan, a second re-introduction with birds dispatched from the Trust
took place successfully in the Che-chi reserved Forest in October 1968.

Negotiations have begun with the Taiwan Government for the re-intro-
iuction of the rarer Mikado Pheasant if a suitable high-altitude reserve
;an be found where the birds can subsequently be protected.
Other re-introductions are proposed. The Cheer Pheasant, Catreus
vallichi , is threatened with extinction in the wild where it is confined to the
Himalayas. Young birds have been offered to the State Government of
dhmachal Pradesh, and arrangements have been made for their release in a
mitable reserve near Simla. It is hoped to send the first consignment of
mung birds for release in the spring of 1970. Discussions are also taking
&amp;gt;lace concerning the possible re-introduction of the Cheer Pheasant, the
Himalayan Monal, Lophophorus impejanus , and the White-crested Kalij,
T ,ophura leucomelana hamiltoni , to certain mountain reserves in Pakistan
vhere the species were once common but are now threatened with
:xtinction.
Mr. Alan Bromby, the National Trust Warden of Brownsea Island,
eported that one pair of Swinhoe's Pheasants on the island had raised
our young this summer. Five adult birds were picked up dead during
he previous winter and post-mortem examination of two revealed death
rom avian tuberculosis, known to be present in the Peafowl which roam
he island. Owing to the denseness of the cover it will not be possible
3 arrive at an accurate census until autumn or early winter. Three pairs
f Blue Eared Pheasants on the island nested and since they had failed to
ear their young in previous years, Mr. Bromby collected eighteen eggs
rom the three pairs, from which he successfully hand-reared twelve young
diich were released in August.
At the Trust the rewiring and re-roofing of the last five open enclosures
r as completed in the spring. These pens will be used for pairs of trago-
ans. An additional twelve new pens were also constructed in the spring,
ringing the total of large covered pens to eighty-six.
Four cabinets, kindly donated to the Trust by the Trustees of the
ritish Museum (Natural History), will be used to accommodate the
tcreasing reference collection of skins and eggs.

An enquiry into lories and lorikeets is being undertaken to try to help
le understanding of their requirements a little better.
There seem to be certain problems which appear again and again,
rincipally concerning diet. Practically everyone has their own different
:cipe for nectar and some do not use nectar at all, preferring a fruit and
:ed diet only.
The scourge of feather plucking is very prevalent among lorikeets in
iptivity, some species being more prone to it than others; this may be
mnected with diet and captive conditions.

The enquiry goes into the breeding question in some detail; as in recent
years more and more species are being bred and with the collected results
of those bred successfully, those who were not so successful may, we hope,
be helped.
A questionnaire has been drawn up and it is hoped that all aviculturists
keeping lorikeets, and willing to participate, will request a copy of it from
the address given below and return it with the information required,
no matter in what part of the world they live.
It is hoped that when the results of these questionnaires are all sorted
out, some of these problems will be answered.
The full results of this survey will be published in the Avicultural
Magazine and also each participant in the enquiry will be sent a copy oi
the findings.
The questionnaires will all be filed at the Harewood Bird Garden,
Leeds, and will be available for inspection at any time. They should be
requested from and returned to: Peter Brown, Curator , Harewood Bird

THE ORANGE-BELLIED FLOWERPECKER
(Dicaeum trigonostigma)
By Alan Booth (Hoylake, Yorkshire, England)

Most people in this country, I think, are unfamiliar with this group of
birds. The Orange-bellied Flowerpecker, Dicaeum trigono stigma, found
over most of S.E. Asia, is one of the most colourful. The following
description is taken from Smythies' " Birds of Burma ".
Length, 3J in. Male: upper parts, deep grey-blue; back and rump,
orange-red; chin, throat and breast, pale grey; rest of under-parts, bright
orange.
Female: olive green above; rump, yellow; chin, throat and breast,
ashy; rest of underparts, yellow; iris, dark brown; bill and legs, black in
both sexes.
I am now serving in the Merchant Navy and this does give some
opportunity to bring home some birds, although in very small numbers.
I saw these flowerpeckers on my third visit to Singapore, in one of the
three bird shops on Rochor Road. There were approximately three
dozen, of which only six were female. I bought two pairs at what I
thought was a very low price--two pounds--which is much below the
price they would be here at home. They were housed in two small cages
and fed on a mixture of Horlicks and honey diluted with water. They
were also given fresh fruit cut up very finely so that each piece could be
swallowed whole.
They were paired to reduce the risk of fighting. One paii did not fight
at all but the other did, with even my intervention at times to separate
them. They made only a sharp " tweet ", much like Zosterops. The
male uttered this note rapidly, when approaching the female with all his
feathers fluffed up, making him like a small black and orange ball. The
only other observation which I made was that during the passing of the
faecal sac the bird appeared to be very laboured and in great difficulty.

I was later assured by Dr. Searle that this was quite normal for Flower-
peckers as he had seen the same with the ones he had kept. The bird
would then proceed to wipe the vent on the perch or bottom of the cage
in a bobbing movement, which means that all perches had to be washed
regularly.
On reaching England only the two females were alive. One died on the
morning of reaching London Zoo, the other died some 17 days later.
This was, I am sure, due to not being able to give enough heat when we
reached our cold weather again, as it dropped some 40* F. between the
Canaries and Gibraltar. Next time I shall take them to the engine-room
when extra heat is needed, whatever the species. This last female was the
one which fought the male, and since Mr. Yealand later identified it as a
Scarlet-backed Flowerpecker, this may have been the reason why they
did not agree.
On my return to Singapore, whenever that may be, I shall always be on
the lookout for this and other species to bring home, this also applies to
birds of all kinds and it does help me to acquire some knowledge in the
event of my keeping birds when I return to land.

RARE AND VANISHING AMAZONA PARROTS
By Arthur A. Prestwich
The Parrot Ban in the U.S.A. was lifted in September, 1967. Since
when Amazona species have enjoyed (?) an ever-increasing popularity and
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.931845705882353" page_id="58089727"  page_num="274" year="" vol="">
the demand is described as quite fantastic. It is, of course, impossible to
estimate with any degree of accuracy, but it is considered that, due to the
very primitive methods of collecting and transporting, of no less than half
a million birds captured, only about 10,000 reach the market alive. A
drain which surely cannot be allowed to go on.
There are 52 species and subspecies and of these many, especially
island forms, while perhaps not in actual danger of extinction, still give
cause for great concern. This is due in the main to forest clearance for
agriculture, coupled with shooting and trapping. Some species are
protected by law, but the law is very difficult to enforce. Special protec-
tive measures are needed now, before it is too late. But it is imperative
that they are enforced, otherwise fine species such as the Bahama
Amazona leucocephala bahamensis , Little Caymen A. 1 . hesterna, Puerto
Rico A. vittata vittata, Rothschild's A. barbadensis rothschildi , Guilding's
A. guildingii , St. Lucia A. versicolor , and the Imperial A. imperialis will go
the way of the Culebra Amazona Parrot A. vittata gracilipes and become
extinct.

concentrating on two favourites--Princess of Wales's Parrakeets and
Splendid Grass Parrakeets. Records covering the past 35 years show
that during that time 902 Princess of Wales's were bred; the best
season producing 64 from 16 mated pairs. The best result with the
Splendid was 134 bred in one season.

In the July-August, 1969, number of the Magazine I mentioned that the
White-tailed Eagle is now only a rare migrant. It is therefore the more
interesting to learn the up-to-date results of an experiment by the Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds. In an attempt to re-establish this
species two young males and two young females, all from different eyries
in north Norway, were taken to Fair Isle for release, in the summer, 1968.
One male disappeared but the other three eagles soon learnt to kill prey
and throve amazingly. During the winter one pair was seen in company,
I the other female being solitary. But during February all three appeared
together, and in March the first female became solitary and in May she

R. J. Porritt reports a breeding success at "Birdland", Cromer. He
writes: " Our successful breeding of the Common Mynah Acridotheres
tristis with a Crested Mynah A. cnstatellus took place in a large, well-
planted aviary 100 ft. x 27 ft.
" Towards the end of May, the two Mynahs built a nest in a privet bush
about two feet from the ground. The nest was similar to a Blackbird's
but much more untidy. Three greenish-blue eggs were laid. The first
sign of youngsters was on the 20th June. When we looked there were
three youngsters, one died within the next week and the other two fledged
towards the end of July. Their appearance is similar to the Common
Mynah. Unfortunately we have since lost one of the youngsters during
a spell of very cold, wet and windy weather; the other is still fit and well ".

This is an excellent popular account of bird flight in all its aspects,
written by an enthusiast who has not let knowledge of his subject erode
his sense of its wonder and beauty.
Descriptions of the mechanics of bird flight, clearly presented in every-
day language are interspersed with vivid descriptions and personal
reminiscences. In the latter the author's trained Peregrine " Princess "
often figures. One suspects the author's admiration for birds of prey in
general and Peregrines in particular may derive largely from his feelings
for " Princess ".
Whether behaviour that, in a crow, sparrow or pigeon would be attribu-
ted solely to fear is, in a Peregrine, largely a result of its " fierce pride "
(p. 7), or whether an American Peregrine really can catch any other
American bird " if it seriously tries to do so " is, perhaps, debateable but
the author's partiality for Peregrines is understandable in view of the
pleasure they have given him.
The book is illustrated with a number of good black and white drawings.
Unlike many books that are aimed at a wide readership it gives a very full
bibliography, and references to the sources of any possibly questionable
statements. It can be recommended to all who wish to learn more about
bird flight (with a good deal of other information by the way) without
having to cope with technical jargon or dull and flavourless prose.

BREEDING OF THE ASIAN GREEN STARLING AT THE LONDON ZOO
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99825492" page_id="58089733"  page_num="280" year="" vol="">
I am able to add some more details to what was said about the breeding of the
Asian Green Starling at London Zoo, in the first two paragraphs on page 106 of
Robin Restall's notes on this species in the September/October issue of the maga-
zine. For when four of these starlings were bred in the Bird House (1957, I 958"
1959), I was employed there, and cared for the aviary they bred in.
On the four occasions the breeding pair nested in the same place. This was on
the peat moss floor of their aviary, in a crevice between two large rocks. The nest
was a scrape in the peat moss, lined with a few feathers, twigs, and pieces of paper.
Each time they laid two eggs, pale green with some spots. Only a single chick was
ever reared at one time however. Whether one of the two eggs disappeared or
whether one of the chicks died soon after hatching I cannot remember now. But
I think the latter was usually the case. From some rather sketchy notes I have from
the time, I know that in 1957 when two chicks were reared from two nests, the
first chick left the nest after 22 days, the second after 21 days. The chicks were
about three-quarters grown when they left the nest, and were grey, with darkly
streaked whitish underparts. In the case of the first chick, my notes tell me that
it started showing some green in its plumage approximately 28 days after leaving
the nest. Unfortunately I do not know the incubation period.
In the large central indoor aviary in the Bird House the breeding pair were
housed with a wide variety of other species, including two other Asian Green/
Malay Glossy Starlings. Because of the many other birds sharing the aviary it
was not possible to give them any special food when they were rearing young.
When the youngsters left the nest they remained in the aviary with the four adults,
and all lived amicably together. Eventually there were, I think, at one time seven
of them living together in the aviary.
