Excalfactoria chinensis.
By E. G. B. Meade-Waldo.
The interesting letter of Mr. Seth-Smitli, describing the
nesting of his Chinese Onails, induces me to record the
successful rearing of a bevy of these charming little birds in
one of my aviaries this summer.
The cock bird is a very old one, and has wintered out for
several years (including the bitter winter of 1895), the East
Riding of Yorkshire. The hen was kindly presented to me this
spring, by Mr. Reginald Phillipps. When placed together, the
little birds paired at once : the cock holding any little tit-bit in
his beak, with his head held on one side, uttering a low crooning
sound until the hen ran up and took it from him.
A nest was scratched in the turf, and the first egg laid on
June 12th ; twenty-one eggs were laid by July 3rd, on which day
the hen commenced to sit. As the number of eggs seemed so
disproportionate to the size of the bird, I removed ten, leaving
eleven in the nest. The hen made up the nest by drawing in grass
stems, and the like, but no feathers at all were added, as is the
case with all the true Partridges, Pheasants, etc. The hen sat
exceedingly well, the cock occasionally sitting by her side but
never on the eggs.
On July 23rd the hen came off with seven young ones,
leaving one dead in the nest. These little birds were most
marvellously active and independent, being able to run quite as
fast as the parents on the day of hatching. They were, of
course, very small indeed, but still they looked far too large for
the eggs they had just come out of. They were dark chocolate
in colour, with two broad dull yellow lines down the back, and
three yellow stripes on the head. They fed principally on ants'
eggs--part of an ants' nest being supplied in a tray twice a-day ;
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.998618068965517" page_id="32638367"  page_num="Page 2" year="" vol="">
they also ate the ants themselves. From the first, however, they
would eat mawseed, also the seeds of various weeds. Their
growth was most wonderfully rapid, as will be seen by the
following dates :
Hatched on July 23rd ; August 5th, full fledged, able to fly
well ; August 13th, the two 3^oung cocks easily distinguishable
from the hens ; August 20th. full grown and almost in full
plumage ; August 27th, young cocks in full plumage, indis-
tinguishable from the parent, and crowing and calling the hens to
feed.
The precocit}^ of these little birds was most remarkable,
especially in gallinaceous birds, where the assumption of full
plumage (especial^ where the males differ greatly in plumage
from the females) is usually a very lengthy process, spread at
least over some months ; in this bird at five weeks old they were
apparently adult.
A prettier sight than this little family are now can hardly
be imagined. To escape the burning sun of the last few weeks
they have made little runs all through the grass of their lawn,
like those made b3^ colonies of field voles. They have little
seats under tufts of grass, and in looking at the grass nothing
whatever is visible. Suddenly a little head pokes up through
the grass and crows ; then another and another peer out in
different places, and answer ; then they all settle down again,
having assured one another that the3 ? are all there. Occasionally
two sit in the same little form, but usually only one.
I forgot to describe the eggs, which were yellowish stone
colour, covered with small spots and dots of very dark brown.
The eggs were large for the size of the bird.

By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
Virginian Cardinals are probably familiar to almost all the
readers of the Avicultural Magazine. In almost every bird shop,
at a certain season of the 3^ear, you may see one or two unhappy
cocks of this species, looking extremely sick and sorry.
I11 bu3dng Virginian Cardinals let me give a word of
caution : Buy them as soon after they arrive as possible, as a
very short stay in a dealer's cage will be fatal, for there the seeds
of consumption will be laid which will sooner or later end the
career of your purchase.
</bodyText>

When once acclimatised, Virginians are hardy enough,
and will stand all weathers with perfect impunity, except fog;
but I have always found newly-come-over specimens exceedingly
delicate. Indeed, I should be ashamed to say how many I have
lost in acclimatising my present pair. But then, it doesn't do to
speak of losses !
I see that people often complain that they cannot keep
their Cardinals in colour. I fancy that the reason is 'wrong
feeding.' Hempseed is usually recommended, and if used freely
I believe it will turn any bird nearly black. I know it will Bull-
finches--a 'black' Bullfinch is simply a bird that has been fed
on hemp. My Cardinals never have hemp ; they have canary,
millet and live food ad libitum : and the cock is the most
glorious colour you ever saw T ; a perfect blaze of scarlet.
When newly imported, Virginians are usually badly
knocked about, and deficient in wings and tail. I always pull
out all the broken stumps, and cage the birds until the new
feathers are come. This takes about six weeks.
My birds are out of doors all the year round in a big
garden aviary, among all sorts and conditions of birds ; and
though there are nests and young all round them, the Cardinals
maintain the path of virtue ; in fact they are the most inoffensive
&quot;birds I know of.
Last 3^ear I came pretty near to success ; but just as the
nest was finished, the hen got a tumour on her breast and I had
to kill her. I soon got a new hen, but the season had gone by.
This year the Cardinals began pretty early with nesting
operations. The cock came into song about March, and soon
after the hen began to carry about sticks and straws, but seemed
unable to find a place to her mind, and went and laid three eggs
on the bare ground. These are very small for the size of the
bird, and exactty like the egg of the common House Sparrow.
I was rather sickened over this, and thought I was to have no
luck ; the more so as having the choice of two nests in the garden
to put them in--a Chaffinch's and a Robin's--I selected the
Robin's, as I thought it most hidden, and of course I chose the
wrong one ; for the next day some young calves in the field got
nosing about, and put their heads into the nest (if was in a
hole in a stump) and smashed all the eggs. That was finish
No. i.
About ten days later, the hen laid two more eggs and again
on the bare ground, and as I could not find a nest to put them in
I gave them to one of my children. Finish No. 2.

About a fortnight after this I happened to go into the
aviary and, quite by chance, found the hen Virginian had built a
nest in a bush, neatly lined with dry roots, and had two eggs.
I looked next day and still only two eggs (much to my joy, as
I knew two would take me plenty of rearing) and the hen sitting
steadily. A curious thing happened now, for whereas until then
the hen had been most ' scary,' she would now let me go quite
close to her without coming off.
The cock now sang magnificently, especially in the
evening ; but he took no part at all in incubation (although we
are told that the cock always sits on the nest when the hen
leaves it). Before the sitting commenced he was most attentive
in feeding the hen ; and all through the time of incubation he
fed his wife assiduously. They feed from the crop.
All went well, and on the 13th day, on looking into the
nest as I passed--July Sth--I found that both eggs had hatched.
The young are queer looking little beggars covered over with
very dark fluff, like young Bullfinches. I watched the process
of feeding with great interest. The modus operandi was as
follows: The cock arrived at the nest-side at stated intervals and
fed the hen from the crop ; she then gently raised herself in the
nest and fed the young. For a week I think she hardly ever
left the nest. All feeding was done by the cock. I gave them
peas, strawberries, cherries, maggots, and mealworms, in
addition to seed. At the end of a week the young had grown
famously, and were a sort of coffee colour. On the eighth day
the eyes opened ; on the tenth they were well feathered ; colour,
a sort of dark brown ; and to-day, July iSth, to my intense
surprise, they have left the nest--I can't say flown , rather they
have hopped out. I found them quite happy, on the floor in the
midst of an admiring throng of Pekin Robins and their own
proud and happy parents. They are queer little mortals with
small crests, no tails, and enormous legs and feet. The funny
thing is, the Pekin Robins feed them as well as their own parents.
The most wonderful part of the whole proceeding, to my
mind, is this, that these birds have been reared in an aviary in
which I have, besides the parents, two pairs of Pekin Robins and
a pair of Shamas. It only shows what can be done.
One other thing I have noticed, my Virginians hardly ever
erect their crests ; whereas in a cage they are alwaj^s on end.
I ought also to say that for five days I was ill in bed, after
the hatching, and the birds were fed by Mrs. Farrar ; so that she
must share the credit of our success.

I have been taken to task over my last article on Pekin
Robins, because I ventured to run counter to the ' authorities.'
Nevertheless, I must do so again here.
Mr. Gedney says that the four eggs were laid at intervals
during eight days. All I can say is, mine laid every day like a
well regulated bird. The cock, again, is stated to have settled
down upon the eggs in the hen&apos;s absence. Mine was never so
incautious.
The young were hatched quite naked. Mine were covered
over with dark fluff.
The young, says Mr. Gedney, fledge rapidly, and leave the
nest at the end of five weeks. I can only say with Dominie
Sampson, Prodigious!!! Mine must have been very previous ;
as they left at the end of ten days !
Judging from " internal evidence," I should doubt Mr.
Gedney's account of the nesting of the Virginian Cardinal.

By the Rev. H. D. Astley.
Even to those uninterested in the ways and habits of
birds, the following experiment must prove attractive. Experi-
ment is hardly the word, for it was by an accident that
a pair of Virginian Cardinals ( Cardinalis cardinalis&apos;) made
their escape from a large pheasautry, where they had been for
two years, and had become inured to the many atmospheric
changes of our climate; not that they are ever delicate birds, for
they make little of a November fog or a January snowstorm.
However, they escaped on the 15th of May (1885), and as they
kept about I did not take much trouble to get them in again,
but put out their tin of canary seed so that they might not starve,
and also as an extra inducement for them not to wander far from
home. The pheasautry in which they had been confined is
situated amongst bushes, and close by a rookery, which is all
paled in, and adjoins the front garden lawns and a fairly large
shrubbery, the home of many a bird ; rich in the growth of
syringas, lilacs, box trees, and many other shrubs, amongst
which spring up old elms, limes and firs. To this retreat, the
Virginian Cardinals soon found their way, and the following
morning after their escape, on going through the shrubbery^, I
saw the cock bird perched on the tip-top of a hawthorn. There
he was, singing as loud and as fast as the notes would come, his
beautiful scarlet breast looking more brilliant than usual in the

full morning sun of a May day, whilst the intense green of tile
hawthorn showed up the bird in strong relief. I felt as I saw
him, that it was a sight that few, if any, in England were enjoying
at that moment, or indeed at any other time, for I have never
before heard of these American cousins being allowed their full
liberty. Two days after this, in a very bare yew shrub, for it was
nothing more, I observed a nest commenced. Although I never
imagined that the Cardinals had already set to work, yet the
nest struck me as being built of an unusual material, and its
general appearance convinced me that no British bird with
which I was familiar was constructing it. The nest was a
very frail one, with no substantial foundation ; merely bits of
dead grass and some old pieces of rush lightly interwoven, the
whole structure being decidedly small for the size of the bird ;
in fact, a Greenfinch would seem a more suitable occupant for
it than its real owner.
The shrub stands at a corner where four paths meet, and
is therefore the most exposed position a bird could choose for
such an object. The same day that I discovered the commence-
ment of this nest, the gardener told me that he had actually
seen the hen Virginian on it, whilst the cock bird perched
himself on the top of the shrub. Exactly a week after they had
escaped, the first egg was laid ; it was rather larger than a
Sparrow's in size, and dirty white in colour, with large blotches
of reddish-brown, thicker at the round end than at the other.
The hen laid five eggs in as many consecutive days. To protect
such an exposed position, I tied some branches of yew all over
the bush, thereby making it difficult for passers-by to see the
bird on her nest.
Four young birds were successfully hatched, the fifth egg
being unfertile. The cock bird almost entirely ceased singing
after the young were hatched, and his state of alarm was great
if anyone passed near the nest. The eggs took exactly a
fortnight to hatch. This brood of young Virginians soon came
to grief ; a bird or a beast of some kind (it is not known what,
but Jays were the suspected culprits) made off with a couple.
The two remaining birds I tried to rear by hand, but they
seemed unable to digest the food and, to my grief, died. The old
couple at once began hunting for another nesting place and fixed
upon one quite close to the former site, but this time in a low
box bush. The nest was quickly finished and four eggs deposited
in it, strict injunctions being given to the gardeners not to
disturb it in any way ; and in order to try and guard against
robbery from mice or squirrels, I tarred the stem of the bush as

<bodyText confidence="0.99948487804878" page_id="32638372"  page_num="Page 7" year="" vol="">
far as I could and also placed some more branches of box upon
the thinner parts at the top, so as to hide the eggs from prying
eyes of unfriendly feathered fowl. But no! after the hen bird
had sat out more than half her time, the eggs disappeared, and--
disappointment No. 2.
The Virginian Cardinals themselves seemed to lose less
heart than I did, for they actually commenced another nest
the day after they had lost their second hope of a brood, and,
experientia docens, they built their third nest in a holly tree of a
somewhat weeping growth, placing it in the under side of an
overhanging branch about 9ft. from the ground. Four eggs were
again laid and hatched on the 5th of August of the same year
(1885) in which the parents had escaped : but when the young
birds, which grew apace, were about a week old once more two
disappeared, evidently taken by a Jay or a Squirrel, for the nest
was rather demolished, so in despair the other two were carried
into the shelter of the house. . One was considerably larger than
the other, and it was this one that succumbed in a day or two,
either to injuries or indigestion ; the other bird, an ugly uncouth
little creature, was fed upon sopped bread and plenty of fruit--
strawberries, grapes, etc. He throve, and he turned out luckily
to be a male bird. I had him for several years in his splendid
scarlet plumage, insolently tame, and a delightful pet. He
attained his red coat in the late autumn to a great degree,
though, perhaps owing to the vicissitudes of his early life, not
nearly so bright in colour as he became in his second year.
To any stranger approaching his cage with friendliness, he
would put up his crest and sing himself hoarse, and if allowed
to come out, he would fly to one's shoulder and wdth grotesque
movements shout into one's ear.
I must add that the parent birds, after having been decoyed
back again into the pheasantry, were once more released in the
following spring, much to their delight. They built again, but
the hen bird, after laying two eggs, was found dead.
This year (1898) I turned out a pair of Virginians in
April, which are still at large, and are to be seen, most days,
flitting about among the trees, or across the lawns. They built
a nest in June, but the heavy rains in the early part of the
month seemed to damp their ardour, and they forsook just
before the eggs, three in number, were due to hatch. Unlike
the former pair, they have not nested again.

INTRODUCTORY.
The Show of British and Foreign Birds, and Hybrids,
held at the Crystal Palace, on the 4th, 5th, and 6th of October,
by the National British Bird and Mule Club and the Foreign
Bird Exhibitors' League, was a notable event in the history of
Bird Shows, because it marks the emancipation of the exhibiting
aviculturists from the bondage of the Canary " fancy " to which
they had hitherto been subject.
The Show was an unqualified success, and reflects great
credit upon Mr. FroSTick, the energetic Hon. Secretary, and
upon the Show Committee. (I think I may say this without
appearing to blow my own trumpet, for, although a member of
the Committee, I must confess that I only attended one meeting).
A remarkable feature was the almost entire absence of
" wrongly classed " entries. I could only find one such entry in
the Foreign classes--an unfortunate pair of Bengalese which
had somehow got into Class 65. This proves what can be done
to prevent (by careful drafting of the Schedule, and the kindly
help of the Secretary) what is usually considered an unavoidable
incident of Bird Shows.
It is to be regretted that the classes for common Waxbills
and Grassfinches were so badly filled. These classes are new,
and exhibitors are a curiously conservative race. Probably many
thought that these classes would be over-crowded, and refrained
from making entries in them for that reason. I believe that if
they be repeated next year, the result will be quite different.
Considering the number of Bulbuls which appeared at the
Palace in February, it is singular that the Bulbul class had to be
cancelled at this Show.

BRITISH BIRDS.
As regards British birds, it is rather doubtful whether the
commencement of October is the most suitable time to hold a
Show : many being scarcely through the moult by that time and,
therefore, not in show form. This being so, one was almost
surprised to find so large a number of specimens, mostly of
grand quality, staged at Sydenham on the 4th, 5th, and 6th of
the month,.

Neither the Bullfinches nor the Goldfinches were quite in
show form : probably a month later they would have looked
decidedly better. The Chaffinches, on the other hand, were a
remarkably fine lot ; the first and second prize-winners being
especially fine specimens. There was also a good collection of
Linnets and the competition was very keen. The winner of the
first prize was a grand bird, in splendid feather and very steady.
Several others, however, ran it very close.
The Twites and Redpolls also formed a large class, a
grand specimen of the former species taking the first prize. A
very large Redpoll, unusually light on the breast, although an
undoubted specimen of A. rufescens, was a good second.
Class 6 (Siskins) contained some very nice birds. The
winner of the first prize was a very highly-coloured bird, and
strongly suggested colour feeding. The second was equally
good, but not so bright in colour.
Class 7 (All other species of Resident Finches and
Buntings). This class contained chiefly Hawfinches and
Yellow Buntings. The first prize-winner--a Hawfinch--was a
very fine specimen, in beautiful plumage. A very bright Yellow-
hammer was second. Miss Hopwood's Reed-bunting was a very
fair specimen, and there was also a Cirl Bunting--a species far
more common in many parts than is usually supposed.
The Class for Migratory Finches and Buntings consisted
chiefly of Bramblings, The first prize winner was far the best,
being unusually rich in colour for the time of the year. A nice
Mealy Redpoll was second, the other prizes going to Bramble-
finches.
The Skylarks were not a large class, but the few there
were,were of great merit. Mr. May's bird,which was placed first,
was one of the best Larks I have ever seen. The Robins were
good: the first and second prize winners being beauties, but not
so steady as they might have been. Some grand Blackbirds
were shown : the winner of the first prize being, to my mind,
quite perfedt.
Song-thrushes were also an especially fine class, and there
was little to choose between the winners of the first three prizes.
The Starlings did not form a large class, but were of very good

quality; Mr. Fulljames' "Jacob"--the first-prizewinner--is an
old friend and an exceedingly nice bird.
Class 14 (Magpies, Jackdaws, Jays and Choughs).--Mr.
Fulljames' Chough was a perfect specimen, and well deserved
the first place of honour. The second prize went to a nice Magpie,

which, however, appeared to have one hind toe slightly deformed.
A Jackdaw was third, and a Jay fourth ; both were exceedingly
good birds.
Class 15 contained some very interesting " rare feathered
specimens of British birds." Mr. Fulljames' Cinnamon Starling
was easily first: it was a charming bird. The second prize went
to a small and insignificant-looking Pied Wheatear, of small
interest compared with the White Whitethroat shown by Mr.
Fishburn, which I think should have been placed second: it was
not an albino, having dark eyes, and showing one or two dark
feathers on the back. A Cinnamon Blackbird, sent by Mr.
Fulljames, was placed third ; and a Cinnamon Chaffinch,
belonging to the same gentleman, obtained the fourth prize.
Other interesting exhibits in this class were a White Finnet, a
Cinnamon Yellowhammer and a Yellow Greenfinch, all shown
by Mr. G. C. Swailes.
Class 16 (All other species of Resident Insectivorous Birds
not larger than a. Woodlark). This was a very interesting class,
and contained some birds very rarely seen in captivity. A
Tree-creeper obtained the first prize, and, considering the
difficulty there must be in keeping this bird in captivity, it
deserved all it got. A Wren, shown by Mr. Maxwell, obtained
the second prize : it looked happy and contented enough, but
it would have stood little chance against a very nice pair of
the same species (No. 215) which were entered in this class, but
for some reason did not turn up until the judging was finished.
A lovely Grey Wagtail (catalogued as a Pied) was deservedly
third, and a nice Pied obtained the fourth prize. There were
two Stonechats in this class: one was a nice bird, but the other
was too ill to swallow a mealworm 011 the first day. Mr.
Maxwell exhibited a beautiful Fong-tailed Titmouse {Acredula
rosea ) which only received a V.H.C. card, although it surely
deserved something more. Mr. Fulljames' exhibit (No. 230)
was a typical specimen of the Continental foim of the Fong-
tailed Tit, known to ornithologists as Acredula caudala, and
differing from the British form by the absence of any dark
markings on the head. A nice Crested Titmouse, a rare British
bird nowadays, and a female Bearded Tit or Reedling were about
the only other birds of especial interest in the class.
Class 17 was devoted to the larger Insectivorous Residents.
No less than seven Greater Spotted Woodpeckers (Dendrocopus
major) were here shown, but one pair did not arrive in time for
competition. With regard to this species, it should be remem-

bered that the young birds have the entire crown crimson ; in the
adult male there is a patch of crimson at the back of the head,
the crown being black. In the adult female there is no trace of
red on the back of the head or neck.
The winner of the first prize, and its next door neighbour,
were illustrations of how a Woodpecker should, and how it
should not, be exhibited. Mr. Barnes' beautiful female, which
well deserved her first prize, was shown in a very suitable cage
in which an artificial log of cork-bark had been fixed. With this
the bird was perfectly happy and contented ; and it was most
entertaining to watch it take a nut from the food-tin and insert
it carefully in a hole in the log, where, with rapid and powerful
blows from its bill, the shell was soon smashed and the kernel
was quickly devoured. The other, No. 236, which one could not
help pitying and comparing its surroundings with those of its
neighbour, was not, in itself, a bad specimen ; but it was a great
pity that its owner was not better acquainted with the nature of
a Woodpecker than to send it to a Show in a cage made for a
Norwich Canary. The poor creature kept trying in vain to climb
the sides of its prison, where it could obtain no foothold, and,
when it hopped on to its perch, it fell backwards upon its tail,
until, finally, it gave up all attempts at perching, and lay down
on the bottom of its cage.
A lovely Missel Thrush, very tame and absolutely perfect,
was deservedly second, and another of the same species, and
almost equally good, took the third prize ; the fourth going to
another Great Spotted Woodpecker.
Class 18 contained a fine collection of Nightingales, and it
was not easy to say which was the best bird : personally, I
preferred the winner of the second prize to the one awarded first.
A nice Blackcap was fourth.
Some very interesting birds were exhibited in the class for
smaller Migrants. It was most unfortunate that those entered by
Mr. George Jeffre}^ did not arrive until just before the Show was
opened to the public, and, consequently, much too late for
competition. The winner of the first prize was by far the best
Yellow Wagtail that I remember to have seen ; it was sent by
Mr. Wm. Cullen, and claimed at the Catalogue-price of #$ 5s. 6d.
A Whinchat. was awarded an extra first prize ; Miss Hopwood's
Wheatear was a good second. There were some very beautiful
Redstarts : one exceptionally fine specimen, shown by Mr.
Maxwell, obtained an extra second prize; a Spotted Flycatcher,

shown by the same gentleman, obtained third, and extra thirds
were awarded to a Yellow Wagtail and a Redstart.
Several Swallows were shown in this class, and, although
some of these were much better birds than many that have at
former Shows taken first and second prizes, none of those here
exhibited obtained very high honours. Swallows always look
miserable and sadly out of place in cages, and it is satisfactory
to find that the Judge did not encourage the capture of a bird so
perfectly adapted to a life in the air and so hopelessly miserable
in captivity. Several Whitethroats, Yellow Wagtails, a Red-
backed Shrike, and a nice Garden Warbler were also shown in
this class, which contained nearly sixty entries, some of which,
however, were absent.
Class 20 (All other species of Migratory Insectivorous
Birds), Five very good Ring Ouzels were shown in this class,
the first, second and third prizes going to these birds; the fourth
was won by a nice Redwing. A miserable young Cuckoo was
shown here also, and illustrated clearly the folly, not to say
cruelty, of caging this species.
The last class that I have to mention was, to me, the most
interesting, as it contained several species of European birds
which are not usually recognised as our fellow-countrymen. A
very fine specimen of Acredula caudata, before mentioned as the
Continental form of our Eong-tailed Titmouse (. A . rosea ) was,
rightly, I think, shown in this class by Mr. Maxwell ; it did not
receive a card, and I find on referring to the Catalogue, that it is
therein marked " Wrong Class." Why this should be is not
clear. I have not the N. B. B. and M. C. list of British birds by
me, but I should be much surprised to hear that the White-headed
form of the Long-tailed Tit is therein included. Some orni-
thologists do not recognise it as a good species, but it is, at any
rate, a very well-defined sub-species, and is certainly not British
although undoubtedly European.
Mr. Fulljames took all the prizes in this class, his rare
Warbler, which I took to be Hypolais polyglotta (but on this
point I am not certain) taking first. A Blue-throat, a most
beautiful specimen, which appeared to belong to the Southern or
White-spotted race ( Cyanecula wolfi ), was second. A nice
specimen of the Greater Nightingale or Sprosser ( Daitlias philo-
viela )-- difficult to distinguish by the light in the tent from our
D. luscinia --third ; and a magnificent Rock Thrush fourth. The
Rock Thrushes are a connecting link between the true Thrushes
and the Chats, and the Chat-like habit of shaking the tail was

Hobbies (Falco subbuteo ) and a Calandra Tark (Melanocorypha
calandra ) were also shown in this class.

PARROTS.
I may, perhaps, be expected to give a few notes on the
classes I judged at the Teague's first Show, held at the Crystal
Palace, on October 4th, 5th, and 6th.
As far as the Parrots were concerned, it was not a very
good show. It is useless to expect one, unless better prizes can
be offered, and a knowledge of the show brought home to the
many possessors of Parrots scattered throughout the country.
It has probabty never dawned upon the minds of the greater
part of them that there is such a thing as a Parrot Show: and,
if it has, they would not risk their pets on a journey for prizes
of 15/-, 10/-, 5/-, and 2/6. To say nothing of the risk and trouble
of sending the birds, the prizes will not repay entry fees and
carriage. The public is indebted for such interest as the shows
have to the competition of two or three great exhibitors, like
Mr. Fulljames, Mr. Maxwell, and Mr. H. B. Smith ; though,
every now and then, an interesting exhibit, such as Mr.
Cocksedge's Red-mantled Parrakeets, is found in a single entry.
M3^ first class was " Tories and Torikeets," which had 14
entries, of which two, if not three, were absent. In this class I
gave the 1st prize to a Forsten's Torikeet, shown by Mr. Arthur
in admirable trim (a) ; 2nd and 3rd went to Scaly-breasted Tori-
keets--the two exhibits were equally smooth and glossy, but I
gave 2nd to the pair as it is more difficult to show a good pair
than one. Fourth went to a Blue Mountain, belonging to Mr.
Silk. Reserve I gave to a bird entered as a Purple-breasted
Tory (b )--this was the most uncommon bird in the class. Mr.
Cusliny showed a Ceram Tory in very good plumage. Mr.
Maxwell's Ornamented lacked brilliancy of colour, and so did
the Blue Mountains. Mr. Smith showed two Rubras, but they
were too rough in plumage to obtain notice. It is a pity to show
Parrots in what are called exhibition cages : it is absolutely
impossible to judge a bird unless you can see all round it, and
any Judge may be pardoned for passing a Parrot in such a cage.
A Musky Torikeet, shown by Mr. Frostick, was too sleepy to
win a card.

My next class was the Greys. Here I had but five birds
before me--506 was absent. The 1st prize was won by Mrs.
Peacock, with a fine bird in irreproachable condition and bloom.
I know something of Grey Parrots, and I have never seen one
better shown, perhaps never so well. Had Mrs. Peacock been a
member of the Teague, she would have taken the prize for the
best-conditioned Parrot in the Show. It was entered as a cock :
it has the build of a hen.
Amazons--my next class--naturally provide more variety.
There were seven birds before me, one was absent. First went to
513--a Festive belonging to Mr. Maxwell, which was very well
shown : 2nd to an inornata of Mr. H. B. Smith ; 3rd to one
entered as " Spectacled." "Spectacled," Russ gives as a term
for the White - browed. This bird almost looked to me like
a young xantholora ; 4th to a well-shown ochrocephala. The
remaining birds were Blue-fronted, and were not in specially
good plumage.
Class 43, for Eclectics Parrots, was poor ; there was only
one well shown. The only remarks I have to make are that all
four birds were cocks, and the second prize belonged to a
smaller species.
Perhaps my most interesting class was 44 : here I had
nine entries and no absentees. I was rather doubtful between
the Meyer and the Bronze-wing for first place. But the Bronze-
wing did not show himself well, owing to his cage, and so I gave
it to the Meyer. The Bronze-wing, who a little later pulled
himself together, was good enough for 1st. The Hawk-head to
which I gave 3rd, was in brilliant health, but not quite through
his moult; had he been, I will not say he might not have been
first. A lineolatus, for the same reason--that he was not through
his moult--got only H. C. There were three, of what I put
down as menstruus. Two of these may have been in immature
plumage, or they may have been of some species of Pionus
unknown to me ; they were in poor plumage (c).
I now come to Macaws--here there were five. First went
to Mr. Fulljames' Hyacinthine, beautifully shown ; 2nd to a
Crimson and Green of Mr. Smith's, too much hidden by its cage ;

came to an end. Here, there were several Leadbeaters beauti-
fully shown, as, indeed, was 53S, a Salmon-crest. I gave 1st to a
pair of Leadbeaters, because it is, as I say, more creditable to
show a pair than one. But it is really no easy task to show a
Salmon-crest with the spotless purity of Mr. Jacob's bird. Third
went to Mr. Maxwell's well-shown lieu Ganga. It is possible,
however, to get Gangas into still better condition, and that kept
her lower than she would have otherwise been. Mr. Fulljames
showed a pair, but they were not in very good bloom. Mr.
Housden's two Leadbeaters were two cocks. In pen 539 there
were a pair of Leadbeaters which I very highly commended,
which were peculiar for the hen being richest in colour.
The Specials, that had to be judged by Mr. Camps and
myself, were two : one for the rarest bird, and one for the best-
conditioned one, belonging to members of the League. Mrs.
Peacock's Grey would have won the latter, but she is not a
member of the League ; after that, it was a toss-up between Mr.
Fulljames' pair of Leadbeaters and his Crimson-wing--the prize
fell to the pair. My rarest bird was Mr. Fulljames' Spix Macaw;
but his Princess of Wales Parrakeet, Mr. Maxwell's Golden-
shouldered, and Mr. Cocksedge's Red-mantled Parrakeets were
all as rare, and in infinitely better condition. So I felt my
classes must resign that prize. Where were the " Unicolors "
Mr. Fulljames showed me at Brooklyn ? (d) But a prize for the
rarest bird is rather difficult to award. As far as I know Spix's
Macaw, the Princess of Wales Parrakeet, the Red - mantled
Parrakeet, and the Golden-shouldered are all one as rare as the
other.
Again, what is meant by the rarest? The one of which
there are fewest specimens in the world ? Who can tell that ?
Or the one that comes least often into the bird-market ? But
one year that is one, another another. Three }^ears ago I would
have given it to the Ganga Cockatoo ; now that is comparatively
often seen. Perhaps Paradise Parrakeets, which at one time
could be easily bought, would win that prize to-day. However,
I must close, leaving my questions for others to answer.

FOREIGN FINCHES.
The classification appeared to me extremely liberal, the
arrangement of the classes was good, and a series of notes, giving
detailed instructions as to entering birds in their proper classes,
made it practically impossible for aiw exhibitor to enter his birds

wrongly. Moreover, very special inducements were held out to
those aviculturists who are unable to keep rare and costly birds,
by providing a number of classes limited to the common and
cheap species. Now we hear a great many complaints about the
impossibility of the smaller aviculturists competing with the
owners of big and costly collections, and about the iniquity of
the latter in " sweeping the board" at all the Shows : here was
an opportunity for the grumblers--special classes for the common
Waxbills, the common Grassfiuclies and the Mannikins, and
prize money equal to that offered in the classes for rare birds.
What was the result ? In each of these classes the number of
entries was very small, and the birds by no means equal in con-
dition to those exhibited in the classes for rare birds. It seems
unlikely that the Committee will consider it worth their while
to provide these classes at any future Show.
In Class 49 (Weavers and Whydahs) the most striking
exhibit was a large cage containing a flock of Paradise Whydahs,
all male birds in full breeding plumage. Such a spectacle alone
was well worth a journey to the Palace. The most uncommon
bird in the class (and probably in the Show) was No. 566, named
by the owner, Mr. Fulljames, a "Pong-tailed Combasou," and
which might be described as a Combasou with a tail of a
Whydah, but the beak was black, not yellow like that of a
Combasou. There were several excellent Paradise Whydahs,
only one of which (No. 569) was accompanied by a female. A
pair of birds, where the sexes differ, makes a far more interesting
and valuable exhibit than a single bird. There were several
Pintailed Whydahs, most of which were exceedingly timid and
wild ; while all their brethren of the Paradise species were steady
and placid. A rare Weaver, sent by Mr. Swaysland, was, I think,
a specimen of the Yellowish Weaver. A Chera procne, sent by
Mr. Housden, was in poor condition. Two of the rare Crimson-
banded or Cut-throat Whydahs were exhibited, neither of
which was in first-rate trim. There were some good Orange,
Oryx, Crimson-crowned and Madagascar Weavers, and a very
nice pair of Combasous.
Class 50 was one of the disappointments : it was limited to
the commoner Waxbills and had only eight entries, one of
which was absent. No. 574 was a nice brightly-coloured pair of
Zebra Waxbills, and 580 a good pair of Orange-cheeks. There
was one entry of St. Helenas (which appeared to be both cocks),
one Avadavat, and no Grey Waxbills.
Class 51 was splendid. Three specimens of the Red-faced
Finch (.Pytelia afro), a male and two females, were contributed

by Mr. I,. W. Hawkins, and each was exhibited separately. It
seems almost a pity that a pair should not have been exhibited
together: however, by separating them the owner gained three
awards instead of two. A very lovel}* female Violet-eared Waxbill,
in the most exquisite condition, was sent by Mr. Maxwell, and a
fine pair of the same species, by Mr. Fulljames ; but the latter
\0x25A0were, unfortunately, moulting. There were several very good
Crimson Finches, one of which, sent by Mr. Maxwell, was
decidedly brighter than the others. Two good Rufous-tails were
contributed by Mr. Maxwell and Mr. H. B. Smith. There were
several excellent pairs of Cordon-bleus, the best of which
belonged to Mr. Fulljames. The Sydney Waxbills w T ere poor.
Mr. Smith's Crimson-winged Waxbill was good: why is it that
one hardly ever sees a hen of this species ? A Green Avadavat
(593) seemed to have sustained some injury on its journey.
Class 52.--Gouldians and Parrot Finches ; 13 entries, and
all good. Mr. Maxwell's Black-headed Gouldian (615) excelled
in the brilliancy of his hues and the satiny polish of his plumage,
and was, moreover, decorated with an exceptionally long pair of
pin-feathers in his tail. The same exhibitor sent a grand cock
Parrot Finch (614). Why is it that Parrot Finches, which are
easy birds to keep in condition, almost always look rough at
Shows? A Three-coloured Parrot Finch (612) was an interest-
ing, but not a very prett} r , bird.
Class 53.--Another class for common birds, and another
disappointment, contained eight entries, including a good pair
of Parson Finches, two good Diamond Sparrows, and some
moderate Zebra and Ribbon Finches.
Class 54.--Grassfinches and Cuba Finches. This was
principally interesting on account of the very beautiful Long-
tailed Grassfinches, more elegant in shape than the Parson
Finches, which they closely resemble, and with more delicately-
shaded tints of grey and brown. Mr. Hawkins' pair (626) were
absolutely perfedt in condition and plumage, and others were
almost as good. The Masked Finches are hardly as pretty. Mr.
Maxwell's Bieheno's Finches were also in exquisite plumage. Is
it possible to distinguish the sexes of this species by inspection ?
With all due respect to certain avicultural writers, I do not
think it possible to distinguish them with certainty --of course,
one can make a pretty good guess in some cases. Mr. Fulljames
sent a good pair of Cuba Finches, and there were several Red-
headed Finches.
Class 55 (Java Sparrows) contained 13 entries. The

White birds were very good ; one always hopes that no faulty
feathers have come out in washing them. The Greys, as a rule,
were less perfect and wilder.
Class 56 (Mannikins), a poor class. Mr. Fulljames sent a
rare bird (569) which, unfortunately, looked very ill. Mr.
Maxwell sent a fine male specimen of Munia pectoralis, to my
mind, the only very attractive species of Mannikin, except the
Bengalese ; the latter are always charming. Mr. Fulljames had
a good pair of Pied Mannikins, and Mrs. Spencer a very nice pair
of Brown and White Bengalese.
Class 59 was the poorest class of Cardinals I have yet seen
at the Palace. Miss Jackson's Green bird, no longer in his first
youth, was the best. A pair of Red-crested birds, belonging to
Mr. Ball, were good in condition and colour, but very wild, and
were in too small a cage. The Dominicans were very wild and
in poor condition.
Class 60 (Grosbeaks, Finches, and Buntings) had some
very nice and interesting birds. Entries 675 and 677, both
belonging to Mrs. Frostick, were birds of two species I had not
previously met with, and both, judging from their appearance,
were somewhat nearly related to the Serin Finches. No. 676,
belonging to the same exhibitor, was a pair of Grey Singing
Finches in particularly neat plumage ; for some reason or other,
one hardly ever sees a good Grey Singing Finch at a Show.
No. 667 was a bright but tailless specimen of Chrysomitris
tristis , and 668 a good Black-headed Siskin : 666, a moderate pair
of Pileated Finches. The remaining birds were a good Non-
pareil, a Jacarini Finch, a pair of Saffron, and two pairs of
Green Singing Finches.

were placed first (with special) as they have been before ; his

clumsy when confined in a Parrot's cage, and under such circum-
stances decidedly handicapped. Mr. D. Seth-Smith's Jungle
Bush Quails (3rd) were pretty, but very timid. The Diamond
and Zebra Doves,as well as the Necklaced Turtle Doves, were all
pleasing to the eye. But this class was poorly represented.
Class 61.--A very good class, and a difficult one to award
individual prizes to. Mr. Fulljames carried off the first three

prizes and a special. Some may consider that the first and
special prizes would have been better awarded to the rare Blue
and Black Tanager, rather than to the Tricoloured. But they
were all beautiful, and perhaps all worthy of the first honours,
though unfortunately unable to win them. One or two of the
Scarlet Tanagers were in good plumage, especially that which
won 4th, being extremely well shown in a cage with a brilliant
green background (Mrs. Frostick's good taste).
Mr. Phillips' Superb Tanager was in glorious colour, and
only deprived of greater honours than V.H.C. by the fadt of his
meeting with rarer cousins in competition.
Class 64.--Amongst Starlings, Mynahs, Troupials, etc.,
Mrs. H. C. im Thurn took 1st with a very tame and pretty
Yellow and Black Troupial. Mr. H. J. Fulljames' Andaman and
Black-headed Starlings were in lovely condition and well shown.
A commendation was given to a healthy pair of apparently
juvenile Rose-coloured Pastors (Mr. J. B. Housden's) (&amp;lt;?). It was
evident that the filthy condition of the cage in which a Long-
tailed Glossy Starling was confined shut the latter off from a
chance of being favourably noticed. It was a pity that Mr.
H. B. Smith's Purple-headed Glossy Starling was somewhat in
the middle of its moult.
Class 65.--A miscellaneous collection, in which were two
or three very interesting birds. Mr. C. P. Arthur's Green-billed
Toucan (a previous winner of 37 first prizes and 34 specials)
added yet one more of each to his list of triumphs. Mr.
Fulljames' Pink-crested Touraco (2nd) was a most beautiful bird,
and debarred from conquering the aforementioned Toucan by
his misfortune in having a malformed foot, owing to some
accident. A very well-conditioned Shama, tame and freshly
moulted, won 3rd (Mr. A. Jones'). Other birds noticed by the
Judge were a lovely Yellow-tufted Honey-eater (Mr. C. T.
Maxwell's) ; an Orange-breasted Toucan, very timid (Mr. Geo.
Jacob's) ; and a splendid Tu&apos;i (Mrs. Frostick's). Nor must I
pass over Mr. Fulljames' Blue-cheeked Barbet, which won 4th
(in fine condition). Mrs. Frostick's Grey Honey-eaters (H.C.)
were, apparently, moulting, though not to such an extent as to
disfigure them, and they had a good roomy cage.

Sir, --It lias been asserted with great vehemence by certain avi-
culturists that certain hybrids are impossible. Among those especially
cited are (curiously enough) crosses between the two nearly related genera
Serinus and Sycalis.
In one of my aviaries I breed a good many examples of the Saffron
Finch, and, early in the present year, I had all my breeding Canaries in the
same aviary. Before these were removed one or two of them were observed
singing vociferously to hen Saffron-finches. The young of the latter have
now moulted and during the process two of them died, but a third
(although it walks like its mother) has none of the saffron tinting of
S. flaveola, whilst the flights are largely coloured with Canary yellow.
This bird is a little shorter than typical Saffron-finches; and I have no doubt
that it is a genuine hybrid, produced without intention on my part.
A. G. Butler.
PARROT FINCHES.
Sir, -- I hope Mr. Phillipps has satisfied himself that he has
successfully reared some young Parrot Finches this Summer : but I cannot
quite understand how there can be any chance of confusing the young and
adults of this species. The young at first are of a very dull green on the
upper parts, with the throat, breast and belly of a dingy yellowish brown,
and there is not an}&apos; scarlet visible for the first few weeks after the birds
leave the nest.
I started, this Spring, in my garden-aviary (covered portion heated
with hot-water pipes) with three Parrot Finches--a pair and an odd female.
On April the 20th, on my return from the Continent, I was told that the
Parrot Finches had a nest in a box, and that the young had been heard for
some time. On the 25th, a young brood was sitting all day at the mouth of
the hole, and on the next day three fine young ones had flown and were
sitting on the highest perch in the aviary, carefully tended by the parents.
They were easily reared on canary seed and millet, the parents always
having access to fresh chickweed, shepherd's purse, etc.
On June the 6tli I left home. At that time there were slight
indications of scarlet on the foreheads and round the angles of the mouths.
On my return, on August the 1st, I found that the young had entirely
assumed the bright colour of the adult, and, in fact, were only to be
distinguished by the superior smartness of their new suits. The old birds
went to nest again, but only hatched one young bird, which left the nest
prematurely and perished. I have had eggs laid in my aviary before, but,
until this Summer, without young being hatched.
While young Parrot Finches are in the nest, and for a week or more
after flying, there are to be seen small warts on the edges of the gapes, like
small opals or cats'-eyes. Similar bead-like warts are noticeable outside
the mouths of young Gouldian Finches, with the addition that, in these,
there are conspicuous black spots on the palate, which are seen when the

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995325" page_id="32638386"  page_num="Page 21" year="" vol="">
young are gaping for food. I did not have the opportunity of noticing
whether, in the case of young Parrot Finches, these palate-marks exist. I
have just been looking at some newly-hatched Gouldiau Finches, and, in
the semi-darkness of their nest-boxes, these jewel-like beads were very
noticeable--in fact, the idea suggests itself whether they are of service
in indicating to the parent bird where food has to be placed. Some of our
members may have noticed whether similar decorations exist about the
mouths of other species building in holes or covered nests.
W. H. ST. Quintin.
Sir,--R eferring to Mr. St. Quintin's letter, I had satisfied myself that
I, or rather the parents, had successfully reared some young Parrot Finches
or I should not have made the statement that appears on page 199. As I
stated, I began with four adult birds, and on August 16th I saw five, so that
settles the matter. Of these five, two appeared to me to be young birds; on
September nth, I saw a group of six, so I was right on this point also.
My inner aviary is as full of small trees, shrubs, and bushes as it is
possible each spring to stock it with, many dying each 3-ear ; and my
luxuriant spring crops of wheat, oats, grass, rape, etc., etc. mostly perish
as the summer goes by, on account of the over-crowding. So thick is
the foliage that it is exceedingly difficult to get a fair view of the birds,
especially of such restless creatures as Parrot Finches, who are all over the
place, and who delight before everything else in creeping like mice through
the very thickest of the ground vegetation, sometimes the whole flock
being completed buried in a patch of long grass, which they honey-comb
with field-mouse-like runs : doubtless they are in search of minute insects.
In addition to the vegetation, the double wire-netting obstructs the view;
and my eyes are no longer young. Moreover, stretching across nearly half
the aviary, at about two-thirds from the front, there still stands what was
once the "gymnasium ; '' years ago this was turned into a triangular bird-
structure, the favourite haunt of the Mynahs; and now it is covered with
Virginia creeper, and, with some elder bushes, completely cuts off from
sight the back of the aviary. During the nesting-season, I never intrude
into this sanctum, and sometimes lose sight of shy species for weeks.
These two young birds were fairly advanced when first noticed, the
throat patch being of considerable size, and of the colour of that of the
face of the female Red-faced Dove-bird. They also had a good show of
dingy red in the rear, the green , especially of the under parts, being of a dull,
almost blackish, tinge.
I have since thrown open the doors which connedl the two parts of
the aviary; and now the little birds come right up to the house, but dart
off into the thicket if the garden door be opened.
On October 6tli, on peeping into the aviary through a window, I
found another brood of three, whose squeaks had been heard for some days,
on the grass just below me. These were babies indeed, one being scarcely
able to fly ; but all, like the first lot, had a certain amount of dingy red
behind ; and they farther differed from Mr. St. Quiutin's birds in that not one,
not one of the whole five in fact, had the dingy yellowish brown extending
to the belly or anything like it. Two, who are very independent, have

only a slight wash of yellow on the throat, while the other, who still sticks
to its mater (or pater), is wholly green in the front, not a suspicion of
yellow being discernible. Probably the former are males and the latter
a female. The beaks are whitish yellow. It seems to me that, with the
one exception, the young became independent of their parents at a very
early age.
These birds, it must be understood, have been bred in the open
garden. The parents have access to sop and to the insectivorous food
supplied to the Warblers ; and they always eagerly avail themselves of any
opportunity that may present itself of snapping up a stray mealworm.
I may add that my Parrot Finches certainly prefer nesting in a low,
well-sheltered, almost dark, spot, rather than high up in the aviary ; and
they prefer making " independent " nests to making use of boxes or the
like.
On October 20th, I caught and examined two of the last brood. Both
were in full moult, and coming rapidly into colour. A supposed male
had the under parts dull black-green ; but the under parts (not counting
the throat) of the supposed female were rather of a yellow-green. The
bill of the latter was orange with dark brown tip ; the lower mandible of
the former was orange and the upper black.

SWALLOWS IN CAGES.

Sir, --I cannot help making a protest against the confinement of
Swallows in cages. One might almost as well try to keep a fish out of
water. To see these poor birds fluttering against the bars of a tiny cage at
a Bird Show is really heart-rending.
A Swallow is a bird of the air, and settles chiefly on a liouse-roof or
tree for the purpose of rest. Swallows feed on the wing entirely, catching
(as everyone knows) the insects in the midst of their graceful and
marvellous flight. It must be misery to them to be forced to peck at their
food from a tray whilst seated on a perch. Both actions are utterly un-
natural to them for the purpose of obtaining food.
One of these birds, exhibited at the Crystal Palace on the 4th of
October, had so beaten its wings against the bars as to make the shoulders
bleed, and the perch on which it tried to balance itself was bespattered
with blood.
There are so many birds that can be made happy in cages, that it
seems unnecessary (if nothing else) to imprison a bird which nobody can
induce me to believe can feel anything but wretched, having within its
inmost being a strong instinct to do that which captivity prevents it from

Sir,--O nce more I send you a record of the doings of my feathered
friends during the present year.
The first to lead off were the Cherry-finches. They built a lovely
nest in a box tree, warmly lined with feathers, and, strangely enough,
decorated on the outside with the same. They laid three good-sized, longish,
white eggs; sat the full time, but failed to hatch : why, I do not know. I
have had this pair for years out of doors.
I will not trouble to record the doings of such common stuff as
Zebra-finches, Silverbills, Ribbon Finches or Avadavats; but there are a lot
of youngsters knocking about.
I have already given an account of the nesting of the Pekin Robins ;
they laid again twice after that--three eggs each time, but I took the nests
for the sake of the Virginian Cardinals. I will say no more about these
latter here, as I have written a special article on their nesting.
My American Mocking-birds built a beautiful nest, but they did not
lay. I quite hope to rear some next year--the second attempt is usually,
with me, successful.
My Malabar Mynahs built twice, a regular Starling's nest in a box ;
they laid about six eggs each time, the same colour as our English Starling
but rather smaller and rounder: all were unfertile--I blame the cock.
In Parrakeets I have done fairly well, I think.
I reared three grand young Redrumps, two cocks and a hen (all sold
long since--I say this for my own protection).
My Kings laid three eggs (at least the Queen did) and sat well, but
they did not hatch. I think the reason was that the cock was a new one and
had been in the aviary only about a week when she laid. My Queen must
be eight years old, to my knowledge. She lays regularly every year.
My Crimson-wings laid three eggs, fertile, but got disturbed. I hope
for better luck next time.
My Turquoisines laid eggs, but failed to rear any young.
The success of which I am proudest is the one recorded in last
month's Magazine--the rearing of African Firefinches. I believe such an
event is quite unique in aviculture, (g) as most people can't keep them
alive.
I have had eggs from Zebra Waxbills and Cordon Bleus, but no
young reared.

(g) Mr. Wiener states that "this bird has been bred times innumerable: " while,
according to Dr. Russ, " not one of all the Astrilds nests so easily as this." It is therefore
only the fact of its breeding in Britain which is (possibly) unique.--E d.

Sir. --Your readers may be interested to hear that I have two young
Indian Avadavats, which left the nest on the 4th of September. One is
very vigorous and feeds itself and bathes freely; the other bird is not quite
so forward.
The old birds built a round nest in a fir-branch in my garden-aviary,
sat in turn, and both fed from the crop. There were 110 empty eggs. The
young are brown, like the mother, with black beaks.
On reading the foot-note on page 177 of the August number of our
Magazine, I removed my already-suspebted Pekin Robins from the aviar} r .
Up to that time I had not one young bird, although my birds had been out
since May the 2nd, and I know some had laid and sat, including Cordon
Bleus. Since the removal of the Pekins I have Zebra Finches, African
Silverbills, Avadavats, and three young Cordon Bleus. The feathers were
just shewing when I picked up two young Cordon Bleus on the sand, and
the next morning the male bird was seen flying about with another in
his beak. They are now sitting again.
All my Waxbills partake freely of bread and milk, which I make at
the breakfast-table each morning; they also have hard-boiled yolk of egg,
mealworms, gentles and wasp-grubs.

CROSSBILUS.
Sir, --On the 15th of August, when I was staying at Worthing, a
dead Crossbill, which had been caught in a trap, was brought to me, and
proved to be a young male, showing one or two reddish feathers on the
back. I was told at the same time that two more had been caught a few
days before by a bird-catcher near the same place, and I subsequently saw
one of these in a cage--a remarkably steady, tame bird.
On the 18th of the month, as I was passing some tall fir trees close to
the town of Worthing, a Crossbill flew down in front of me, amongst
some Sparrows, immediately attracting my attention by its unmistakable
note-- chit, chit, chit --and its tameness; it was quite as tame as the Sparrows
and allowed me to approach to within a few feet of it.
Again, on the 23rd of the month, when about a mile from the same
place, I heard the note of a Crossbill, and, approaching, saw the bird,
perched upon a dead branch some ten feet above my head. This one was
also remarkably tame, and allowed me to stand just under it and watch it
for quite five minutes before it took flight.
On August the 26th four Crossbills, seen about two miles from
Worthing, were flying separately, all in a North-Easterly direction. I had
no difficulty in identifying them by their note and flight.
I have neither seen nor heard one since. Those that I saw quite
close were young birds, showing little or none of the red plumage.

THE YOUNG G 0 ULD 1 AN FINCH.
( Poeph ila m ira b il is J .
By Arthur G. Butlhr, Pli.D.
On September 24th I received a box from our member
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.99436608" page_id="32638392"  page_num="Page 25" year="" vol="">
Mr. W. H. St. Ouintin, containing four young of the Red-headed
variety of the Gouldian Finch, with an expression of his wish
that I should describe them for the Magazine.
The birds, as I subsequently learnt, were hatched on the
15th of the mouth, or possibly a day or two earlier (in a covered
nest-box). The mother died on the 6th, but an unattached
Black - headed hen undertook incubation jointly with the
surviving male parent. The latter died on the 17th, and the
Black-headed foster-parent continued to feed the young until
the 23rd, when she also died ; the nestlings consequently expired
from cold on the same day, their crops still containing seed
when they reached me.
One of the peculiarities of these squabs is the total naked-
ness of their bodies, and that too at so advanced an age ; but in
this respect they do not stand alone in the family Ploceidce, for
Dr. Russ comments upon the complete and repulsive bareness
of the young of the African Silver-bill. The most interesting
feature, however, in this species consists in the striking and
peculiar ornamentation of the outside and inside of the mouth,
the object of which, as it seemed to me, must be to enable the
parents to feed the young in the partial obscurity of the nest;
but the suggestion was made, by one to whom I showed the
young birds, that should a small snake insert its head into the
nest, it would be unable to recognize its prey in nestlings so
startlingly ornamented.

The snake theory is a favourite one with the more
enthusiastic of modern evolutionists, but I hold to the view
that the ornamentation is merely a guide to the open mouth of
the infant bird, and in this opinion I am pleased to find that I
have the support both of Mr. St. Ouintin and Mr. Meade-Waldo.
In a letter dated September 25th, Mr. St. Ouintin writes
as follows :
" As regards the moutli-ornamentation, in a short paper
on the breeding of Parrot-finches, which I have lately sent to
Mr. Fillmer, I mentioned that the nestlings of that species bave
somewhat similar bead-like warts on the mouth (as the Gouldian
Finches).
" I found yesterday, in a nest-box, some partly fledged
young Cordon-bleus which had died ; these also showed some
mouth decoration, but they were not fresh enough to send up to
you.
" In that paper I suggested that the iridescent warts and
palatal spots might be of service to the parents at feeding-time,
in the case of birds breeding in covered nests or in holes. But,
on the other hand, I do not know any of the native hole-
breeders, or those with domed nests, whose nestlings have any
special growths or excrescences ; though some of them breeding-
in holes, as Tits, and also birds building in the semi-darkness of
dense bushes, as Hedge-sparrows and others, have brightly
coloured gapes, which may answer the same purpose of indi-
cating where a hungry mouth remains to be filled.
" Mr. Meade-Waldo, who is staying with me, has just
bred some Black-headed Gouldian Finches ; and tells me that,
in the darkness of a nest-box in the upper part of the aviary
under the roof, the six young birds could be easily counted by
the gleaming beads on the edges of their mouths, even when
nothing else was visible."
It is asserted by certain evolutionists of the modern
school that ever) r type of ornamentation has a definite object and
is necessary to the preservation of the species, but I am not
convinced of the truth of this assumption ; for I believe that
excess of vital energy in any part of an organism may find vent
in the production of a monstrous growth, which may not be
absolutely necessary, though not injurious: or may only serve
the same purpose as a far less remarkable modification.
The swollen and expanded base of the upper mandible
in P. mirabilis (w T hen first hatched) is dull yellow, but as it

narrows towards the hardened apex it is crossed by a broad
blackish belt; the tip is horn-yellow; and the culmen towards the
tip bears a little conical prominence which renders the end of
the upper mandible obliquely truncate when viewed in profile.
The lower mandible seen from below is liorn-yellowish,
partly bordered and traversed just before the tip (which is
deflexed) b3^ a broad blackish ^-shaped band.
The most curious part of the mouth - ornamentation
consists in the character of what Dr. Russ calls the waxy-glands
(the expansions and warts at the posterior edge of the upper
mandible and at the back of the opening). The lateral expansion
is indeed not remarkable, being less developed than in many
species and of a pale milky yellowish tint ; but at the back of
the mouth are three prominent rounded tubercles in the form of
a triangle, two at the base of the mandibles of a bright and
almost metallic glistening opaline blue and one behind these of
a pale yellow tint.
The inside of the mouth is either ivory-white or flesh-pink,
the palate conspicuously marked (like a domino) with five more
or less round black spots in pentagonal form ; one in front, two
wide apart in the centre, and two near together at the back;
and, in front of each of the four posterior ones, an obliqire rosy
longitudinal streak (probably arteries, and owing their colour to
blood) ; the inside of the upper mandible is marked by a broad
^y-like baud each ramus of which is pterygoid ; very broad
beyond the middle, then abruptly narrowed and tapering to a
point.
The tongue is crossed just in front of its centre by a broad
belt, or by two large pear-shaped black spots, with apex directed
forward. The lower mandible is bordered inside with black,
and behind this border is a submarginal black V-shaped band.
Altogether the ornamentation of the mouth in this young bird
is very remarkable.
My sou and I have carefully examined the metallic
tubercles under the microscope and find that they are filled with
dark brown pigment, the iridescent-colouring being produced,
as I anticipated, by fine reticulation of the outer surface: this
reticulation is clearly discernible under a high power. A
transverse section shows the metallic gloss on the convex
face of the tubercle with the mass of brown pigment behind it.

Observations and Little Dij]lc^llties.
By A. Savage.
I had some peculiar experiences last season with my
pair of Redrumps, and relating them may interest the readers of
the Avicultural Magazine. The pair I refer to is the old pair,
now in my possession over three years, in their (about) half a
cubic metre box-cage, and which have reared so many young--
thirty-one--all disposed of, except one that escaped. They have
hatched in all thirty-four, but three died this season quite young,
as will be seen further on. I must admit that the cock is not
altogether an exemplary father when the young leave the
nest, and, had I not kept an eye on him, many of them (cocks
especially) he would surely have killed on leaving it, days before
they could feed themselves. His conduct in this respect is
probably due to their being in rather close quarters : the young
not being able to get far enough out of his way, and the parents
being very regular and quick breeders. For the last three years
they have had three nests each year, and each year the eggs were
laid at the commencement of March, May, and July, as regular
as clockwork, almost to the day, and never a week's difference in
the dates. Every year I have noticed the cock's impatience to
get his youngsters off his hands just when the hen was about to
lay again, but formerly it was mostly with the second and third
nests--the second especially--but this year he commenced mal-
treating the young of the first nest, and days before they could
feed themselves. I caught him in the act one morning, and,
just as he was doing his best to throttle one poor little one, gave
him a good "spanking" with nr}&quot; handkerchief, which frightened
and stopped him for an hour or so ; but he began operating on
them again in the afternoon, and I had to take him away and
cage him alone. I was rather loth to do so, as I could see the
hen was coming on to lay, but I acted on the " bird in the hand "
proverb, and out he came ! For the rest of the day quiet was
restored, and the hen spent her time in looking after and feeding
her frightened and half-beaten-to-death youngsters.
The next day she laid the first egg of her second nest,
which eventually consisted of five eggs, and continued feeding
her first little ones while laying this clutch. Everything went
well during the time she was sitting, the cock bird being close at
hand but out of sight, in his prison-cage, making a big fuss and
noise ; and during her sitting process the first young learned to

29
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999768976744186" page_id="32638396"  page_num="Page 29" year="" vol="">
feed themselves. Although the cock was taken away before she
laid, I rather expected one or two of the first eggs of the clutch
might be good, and determined to let her sit out to try the
experiment; but I must say I was surprised to find, eventually,
that all the eggs were good and everyone hatched! Another
interesting point then remained to be seen--could she rear five
young birds alone ? The first day or two she was more than busy
chasing youngsters No. i out of her way and feeding babies
No. 2 ; to give her a chance, I removed No. i, who were then
quite capable of looking after themselves, so that she could give
all her attention to No. 2 little ones. The task was too much for
her, and they began to die. She might, perhaps, have reared
one or two alone, but five were too many.
When young Parrakeets are being reared under ordinary
circumstances, the hen is rarely seen out of the nest for the first
five days or a week : the cock usually goes to the nest to feed
her, with food probably in a partly digested state, and she passes
it on to the young ones. I am of opinion that the first week of
a young Parrakeet's life is its most critical stage, and it is at that
time the cock's assistance in feeding is the most needed.
The brave little hen stuck to her task of rearing alone,
though it was clearly above her capacity, and she seemed in a
trembing state of exhaustion from it. This, of course, could not
be allowed to continue ; losing a hen of her value would never
do ; and the putting back of the cock (after two of the young had
died, while another looked very weak) was the only chance of
saving her and them. As he had never seen the eggs, much
less the young, I did not know how he would take it. On his
introduction there was a good deal of " chattering and wing-
sliaking," during which, I suppose, the hen assured him the
youngsters were really his and his alone. Their behaviour was
interesting and curious to observe, and he, after several cautious
peeps, darted into the nest, came out again, and commenced
feeding with his gallant little partner. I knew then all was
well. The young were fed afterwards by both parents, and the
"hungry cry" the}^ seemed to utter before the cock was put
back, ceased. The weak one referred to died a day or two later,
being too far gone to profit by the cock's extra feeding; but the
other two were eventually reared, and turned out cocks. All
went well till they were nearly ready to leave the nest, when the
old cock nearly killed them, and this time before they left it. The
same reason again--the hen about commencing to lay another
clutch, and the cock wanting the youngsters out of the way.

I may mention here that there are two nest-boxes at the
hen's disposal, so it is not for the want of nesting accommodation
that the cock acts as he does towards his offspring. He was, of
course, caged up again, and the hen left to nurse and look after
her two sons : and they really wanted all the care she could
bestow upon them. They made fine progress ; but&apos;more trouble
was in store for them, for within a week the hen laid again. We
were then with tw 7 o young birds scarcely able to nibble seed or
even green food ; and the mother laying without the cock--taken
away a week previously. What w r as to be done ? I did not want
her to lay and sit on unfertile eggs, as it was more than probable
they would be, the cock having been removed before she w 7 as in
laying condition ; and on the other hand, I did not care to
sacrifice (" bird in the hand " proverb again) the two young
cocks for eggs that might not hatch. However, as the hen was
continually uttering her " pairing-cry," and the cock answering
with his pretty little song, never so frequently heard as in the
breeding season, I determined to take the two young ones away,
and assist them as much as I could in feeding themselves--by
giving them plenty of chickweed in seed, tender to nibble with
their slender beaks, and bruising their seed a little--and to put
the cock back with his mate again. She had then laid two eggs,
which I marked ; stopped laying for two or three days; then laid
three more, and commenced sitting. With the above food the
two young cocks did very well, and in a week w r ere quite saved.
The five eggs the hen was incubating gave the following result--
Two (those marked) clear, and the other three all hatched. The
young are just now about to leave the nest, and are one cock aud
two hens.
The object of these few notes is to mention the fertilizing
of Parrakeecs' eggs : to induce amateurs to give the eggs a trial
should they ever be placed in the same position as I w y as, and
not throw them aw r ay immediately^ as "sure to be barren," just
because the cock was not with the hen till the last moment before
she commenced laying. I believe there is a great difference
between the fertilizing of Parrakeets' eggs and Fowls' eggs.
On this subject one well known writer says: "The pairings of
Parrakeets are repeated and long, frequent pairings being
necessary to fertilize the eggs ; quite the opposite to fowls,
where the cock, in one operation, fertilizes a whole batch of
eggs." With these remarks, from a reliable source, in mind, I
was rather doubtful of the fertility of the two or three last
eggs of the first clutch of five mentioned ; but it is evident the
necessary amount of pairing had taken place, for all hatched.

With the second clutch it was the contrary, the cock had to be
taken away too soon, lienee the first two eggs were clear; and
had he not been put back to the hen when he was, the last three
would probably have been clear also. I presume from the
preceding that when a sufficient amount of pairing has taken
place, the fertilizing extends to the end of the clutch, and I
think at least eight days must have elapsed from the time the
cock was taken away from the hen till she laid the fifth egg of
those all fertile. Her failing to bring up the young, alone, tends
to prove the necessity of the cock's assistance when the family is
numerous and of a tender age.
Apart from the pleasing song of the cock, Redrumps have
several other notes, each having a different meaning, and some
of which are the following :
ist.--The "fright-note"--a piercing shrill note both birds
utter when frightened.
2nd.--The "pairing-note"--a low wheezing sound heard
from the hen only, and a sure sign she is coming on to lay.
3rd.--The " excitement-note"--a chattering note both give,
accompanied by the wings being thrown forward and shaken,
when the birds are in a state of excitement and are discussing
family matters between themselves.
4th.--The "bad-temper note"--an unwelcome sound--a
cackling noise made mostly by the cock, which indicates his
vicious state of feeling towards his youngsters, and precedes the
maltreatment they will surely get after it.
By observing these few notes, anyone who has had a
little experience with these handsome and interesting Parra-
keets may know wdiat is going on in their aviary and between
themselves, although yards away and out of sight.
A little care and watching is, nevertheless, advisable, to
ensure success in their breeding, for, as is the case with other
birds (and sometimes human beings, too) they are at times prone
to leave undone things they ought to do and to do things they
ought not to do, and then failure is likely to ensue. An open
eye, and matters put right in time, will save many a nestling.

THE TAIL OF THE INDIAN SHAMA.

f Cittocincla tricolor ].
By Reginald Philupps.
In our Magazine for February, 1898, the Rev. H. D. Astley
gave us an interesting account of the Shama ; and in his
description as well as his illustration of the bird he represented
the outer tail-feathers as being white. In a foot-note at page 68
I ventured to point out that, if these side feathers in Mr. Astley's
bird are wholly white, it would seem to be a specimen of
C. suavis rather than C. tricolor.
A few months later, through the courtesy of Dr. Greene,
I became possessed of the body of a fine Shama ii|- inches long ;
and I think the details of the colouring of the several feathers
of the tail--a tail of the t3 ? pical Indian Shama--might with
advantage be recorded in our pages.
The two central feathers were 6J- inches long, and were
wholly black.
The next feather, on each side, was 5f inches long, and
likewise wholly black.
Of the next, 4f inches long, measuring at the edges of the
feather--nearly the whole of the inner and 3I inches of the
outer web were black. In each feather, the line of demarcation
between the black and the white is drawn in an irregular slanting
direction, but in some much more so than in others. It is the
basal end that is black ; and in most of these feathers the black
runs up the shaft beyond the line.
The fourth feather from the centre was 4 inches long, the
black extending from the base 2J inches on the inner web and
2\ inches on the outer.
Up No. 5, which was inches long, the black extended
2% inches and 2 inches respectively.
The outer feather, on each side, was 2\ inches long, of
which the black claimed i# inches of the inner and if inches of
the outer web.
Doubtless the measurements will differ somewhat in
different specimens ; even the corresponding feathers in this
tail did not agree in every case ; nevertheless these particulars
relatively agree with a smaller tail which I have had by me for
some years.

By W. Nicholson.
The Scarlet Tanager in my possession was purchased
when quite a young bird, and had not then attained his adult
plumage. Whilst in this state, I never heard him utter anything
except the familiar cry of " tak," which he only repeated when I
went near his cage or was feeding him. At the end of last
summer, after he had moulted and assumed his scarlet and black
plumage, he seemed to become more lively ; and one day I heard
a peculiar song, but was not sure which of my birds was the
author of it, until I had a peep into the bird-room and found it
was the Scarlet Tanager, which I had previously thought to be
a dummy as regards song. Certainly the song does not approach
that of the Thrush, although I am inclined to think the Scarlet
Tanager has pilfered a note or two of his. The song is, as
near as I can render it : Chip, chip, cheery ; chip, chip, cheery ;
bo-peep, bo-peep ; chirat, chirat; cheo, cheo ; ieeswit, teeswit, teeszvit,
teeszvit; whizee, whizee, zvliizee. This he repeats over and over
again, particularly in the morning after he has had a feed, and at
night before going to roost. Since he began he has improved a
good deal, and his voice has become more subdued and the notes
more distinct; but he has some good tutors, such as a Calandra
Lark, Blackcap, Sliama, and Thrush, besides a miscellaneous
collection of finches.
The Superb Tanager has always been fond of repeating
his sharp chirp, and uttering a few harsh notes very similar to
those of the Sliama, when the latter becomes excited ; but only
occasionally have I heard him utter a few sweeter notes, not
of any long duration, and similar to that of the Indigo Bunting,
as Dr. Butler describes it.
The Violet Tanager has a pretty little song, and is fond of
repeating it somewhat after the style of an Avadavat ; but
still he occupies a back seat as compared with his companion.
Unfortunately I cannot make his companion out ; I think he is
either Euphoniagracilis or Chlorophonia viruiis, but I am not sure:
at any rate he is the champion. On the morning of his arrival,
directly I took him out of his travelling cage and put him into
his permanent home, he commenced with his call-note, which is

so identical with the Robin's note that my Robin answered him
immediately, and now they frequently call to each other.
After he had been in my possession a week he began
to sing a very pretty melody, which I can only compare to the
Robin's, but the notes are more connected and of longer duration.
He is very fond of singing, and is at it incessantly from morning
till night; in fact, he will sit on his food-dish and utter a few
notes between the mouthfuls of food, and may be heard singing
away when all his neighbours are having their afternoon snooze,
and long after they have retired for the night.
I have also amongst my collection the Blue and Black,
Striated, Crowned, and Chestnut-backed Tauagers ; but have not
had them long enough to allow me to speak about their vocal
abilities.
Since writing the foregoing my Crowned Tanager has
shown a little inclination to tune up. Yesterday (October 12th),
when all his neighbours were having a rehearsal, he commenced
to give a song very similar to that of a Starling, and flapped his
wings in the same manner, at the same time doing a sort of dance
like the Bengalese, but at each bow he tapped the perch with his
beak. He did not sing very long--but then, he is not in good
plumage and minus his tail, therefore he may do better later on.

Sir, -- It maj&apos; perhaps interest some of our members to hear that I
have bred three hybrids from a cock Red-headed Finch and a hen Ribbon
Finch. The young birds are two cocks and one hen, and were bred in am
outdoor aviary without my knowledge, so that I was much surprised by
their sudden appearance on September the 1st. The two males show their
hybrid origin very distinctly, having the band of the male Ribbon Finch
and also red (which is apparently increasing) on the head; the tliroat-band
is also of the brick-red shade shown on the head of their male parent, not
the more purple shade of the pure Ribbon Finch. I found, 011 searching for
the nest, that the parents had driven out a pair of Zebra Finches from a
box 011 a pole in the aviary, and built their own nest on the top of the
Zebra Finches' nest--which latter contained five eggs.
I have owned the Red-head cock four years; and one mate of his own
species and three or four Ribbon Finch wives, that have been supplied to
him in succession, have all died egg-bound.
I moved to my present residence this Spring, so that my birds were
not turned into their present aviary until quite the end of June ; since then
Saffron Finches, Parson Finches, Zebra Finches, Bengalese (two pairs) and
this cross-mated pair have all bred in the aviary; and I have now a pair of

Ribbon Finches and a pair of Dwarf Finches sitting, besides, possibly,
some others, as there is a thick hedge in the aviary. The Saffron Finches
lost their young, and are, I think, breeding again. The other birds reared
broods. F. D. H. Daly.

NESTING OF THE DIAMOND DOVE.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.925927761904762" page_id="32638402"  page_num="Page 35" year="" vol="">
Sir,--A pair of Diamond Doves in my aviary have, this year, success-
fully reared two pairs of young birds, a fact that is perhaps worth recording
in our columns, since the species has not very frequently been reared in
English aviaries.
In the early part of the year, I had two pairs of Diamond Doves in
an indoor aviary, and I found the hens very subject to egg-binding, in fact
one of them succumbed to this complaint in April. In May, a pair was
put into a garden aviary, where they soon commenced to build. They
would not look at any artificial nesting-receptacles, but preferred to build
as Nature had taught them--amongst the natural branches. The nest was
composed entirely of stiff pieces of grass ; it was very small--about two
inches in diameter--but well made and strong. The eggs were hatched
in about twelve days, and the young grew very rapidty; in fact they were
sitting outside the nest when they were a fortnight old, and in less than
three weeks from the time they hatched were able to fly as well as their
parents (a).
The old birds went to nest again very soon after the young could fly,
but they continued to feed the latter until they were quite able to look
after themselves.
Young Diamond Doves are at first barred with brown, and have
none of the white wing-spots ; these, however, begin to appear when the
birds are about a month old. The bright red skin round the e}-e is not
developed until they are six or eight weeks old, when they are
practically indistinguishable from their parents.
I think it is advisable to separate the sexes during the winter months
and keep them out of hearing of one another, or else, even if the tempera-
ture be kept fairly high, the hens are apt to become egg-bound and die in
the early spring.
I think it is improbable that Diamond Doves would breed success-
fully in an indoor aviary unless it were of a considerable size ; few birds, in
my opinion, do half so well indoors as out, in the summer.
Diamond Doves are, to my mind, the most charming of foreign
Doves: the}^ are hardy, very beautiful, of a decidedly cheerful disposition,,
and, if suitably housed, are free breeders in captivity.

THE MADAGASCAR WEAVER.
Sir,--I should be glad to know the experience of any members of
the Avicultural Society in keeping the Madagascar Weaver (Foudia madagas-
cariensis) with Waxbills and other small birds. Is he a safe or a dangerous
bird ? I should like to know their observations of his character, both in

cage and aviary--for I believe that many birds, which will maltreat others
in small quarters, will not do so when they have ample room.
Last winter I tried two of these Weavers, newly-imported, in a fair-
sized cage with a pair of Nonpareils and a favourite old Gouldiau Finch,
but had to remove them for persistent bullying. This summer I have a
large new outdoor aviary--the summer residence of my Waxbills and small
Finches. The Weaver (for only one survives) is in splendid feather; and
his agile movements and flashing colour would be a great addition to the
beauty of the tribe in the aviary, but I have never dared to turn him
among them. Against another year, I should like to know the risk of
doing so.

DRIED FLIES.
Some weeks ago I purchased a 5/- bag of " Zeke," in the hope
and belief that I had obtained a valuable addition to my birds' larder.
Considerably to 1113&apos; surprise, 1 find that none of my birds will touch the dried
flies when unmixed with other food, and that although they appear to be
eaten when stirred into a mixture of sponge-cake, ants' eggs, and preserved
egg, the food seems to be less readily eaten than when it does not contain
flies. I have offered the flies to the following birds--Bulbuls (three species),
Superb Tanager, Zosterops, Sugar-bird, Nightingale, Wheatear, Whinchat,
Blackcap, Garden Warbler, and Lesser Whitethroat--with the result that
none of them will eat them, except, as it were by accident, when mixed
with other food.
I should be glad to know whether other aviculturists have had a
similar experience, or whether I must consider my birds exceptionally
dainty.
I find that "Zeke" contains a large proportion of dust and rubbish,
and requires to be well sifted before use. It does not keep so well as ants'
eggs, as a sort of mould rapidly forms on the outside of the bag.
I hardly think that "Zeke" is as much of a novelty as it is
represented to be. I bought some dried flies in 1895 which had the same
" ancient and fish-like smell," and must, I think, have been obtained from
the same source (b).

SOME FALLACIES.
Sir, --(1). We are commonly told by our " guides " that Australian
Crimson Finches are the most dangerous of birds ; that to put them into an
aviary with other birds means, for the latter, murder and sudden death. I
can assure our gentle readers, from a large and long experience, that this is
not so. Crimson Finches behave in a most exemplary manner in a mixed
collection. I have a pair at the present moment in one of my large aviaries,
and they behave admirably. Again, we are told that the male Crimson
Finch always makes it a point of honour to slay his wife as speedily as
possible. I again assert that this is arrant nonsense. I have had many
pairs, and the)&apos; never offered to fight. I have a pair now, and the}&apos; are like
Queen Elizabeth and Leicester, " When you see one the other is not far
away." I can only suppose that in the solitary case where a Crimson Finch
murdered his wife, he was feeling desperately ill ; and this solitary case has
been quoted by subsequent authorities as the normal state of things.
Likely enough, I shall be told that my Crimson Finches are the exception
which prove the rule; but all I can say is that I have had many exceptions.
(2) . Dr. Butler made the astounding statement in the Feathered World,
that Common Waxbills are so delicate that he cannot keep them alive.
Why, I should say that there is no hardier bird imported. I have had my
present pair for years. I don't think you could kill them by fair means--I
couldn't. I don't say what Dr. Butler could do.

rice, and they are in perfect health and condition. I never find any
difficulty in keeping them ; nor does my friend Mr. Oates, of Leeds--I
suppose, again, we are " exceptions."

Wondrous diets are recommended--no wonder the Tanagers refused to live.
One gentleman talked about the ripe bananas of Pernambuco. Well, my
Tanagers do very well on bananas out of Leeds Market, and are thankful
for them. I will undertake to keep a Tauager with the greatest ease on
banana and Abrahams' egg and boiled rice for any reasonable time. I have
Superb and Violet Tanagers, and I had Reds, but I sold them as they were
such murderous wretches--(but that is another story). So far from Tanagers

In the foregoing letter, as in previous communications, the Rev. C. D.
&quot;Farrar assumes that where his observations differ from those of other
writers one or the other must be wrong. This is an entirely unnecessary
assumption, as all aviculturists know how widely the experience of two
observers may differ as to the habits and character of the same species. For
instance, Dr. Butler found the Parson Finch intolerably spiteful in his
aviaries --I have kept that bird for years in mine without mishap, and have
had many young ones in a small aviary filled with defenceless species. Yet
neither Dr. Butler nor I doubt the correctness of the other's observations.
It is a pitjr that Mr. Farrar will persist in thus assuming that differing
observations are necessarily contradictory, but unfortunately he is not
satisfied with that but goes a step further, and claims, as a matter of course,
that when he differs from others he alone is right and the statements of
others untrue. By taking up this position he prejudices many against his
views, needlessly irritates his opponents, and renders it difficult to conduct
a friendly discussion with him. I feel bound to remind him that writers in
this Magazine are expected to express themselves courteously and with
consideration for others, and that its columns will not be allowed to become
an arena for ill-mannered controversies.
After this introduction I will reply to Mr. Farrar's "Fallacies"
seriatim.
(1) . Like other birds, Crimson Finches doubtless differ greatly in
disposition, yet most observers find them very dangerous to other birds.
Mr. Wiener says, "In the aviary the Crimson Finch is one of the most
combative of small birds, especially at breeding-time." (Cassell's " Canaries
and Cage Birds," p. 370). Dr. Russ sa3&apos;s, "A male in my bird-room was
sociable, yet at times spiteful towards small birds." (Butler's " Foreign
Finches in Captivity," p. 147). Dr. Simpson, quoted by Dr. Butler, says,
"I know of no small birds which equal these for spitefulness," and Dr.
Butler adds, " Mr. Abrahams gives them the same character." My own
pair were so spiteful that neither could be trusted with other birds, and one
day the cock attacked the hen and nearly killed her. On the other hand,
Mr. Todd found the species peaceable ( Avicultural Magazine , Vol. iv., p. 5). I
think the evidence in favour of its dangerous nature so greatly^ predominates
that it is the duty of a writer on aviculture (even the despised author of a
"Guide") to warn the novice against it. Recently the Crimson Finch has
become comparatively' common, and I shall be glad if others who have
kept it will record their experience of its disposition.
(2) . Dr. Butler will no doubt deal with this point ; but everyone
knows that the Grey Waxbill is not usually delicate, and I do not think
that Dr. Butler can have stated the contrary (d).
(3) . Paddy rice is certainly not essential for fully' acclimatised Pin-
tailed Nonpareils -- in fact they often cease to care for it. But it is a great
(d) Mr. Farrar's experience of this and other birds is based upon a large garden
aviary with plenty of cover. In such an aviary I will venture to say that the natural
characteristics of birds are less likely to become obtrusive than in an indoor aviary of
moderate dimensions--say five yards in length by half that in width -- nevertheless, it is
always unwise to crow too loudly : his experience of Scarlet Tanagers tallies with that
of other aviculturists, and he may have to change his views with regard to Crimson
Finches. Grev' Waxbills, when kept indoors, live longer in small than in large aviaries.
I do not remember to have made any general statement. I mentioned my own
experience.--A. G. 13.

lielp in getting freshly imported birds to live, especially if it be given after
steeping in water--and anyone who buys unacclimatised Pintails would be
-very unwise to neglect its use, if he can procure it. If Mr. Farrar alludes
to newly imported Pintails, when he says he " never has any difficulty in
keeping them," he has either been most unusually fortunate, or he has
discovered some secret as to treatment which all of us would like to
learn. Dr. Butler has recently recommended oats as a substitute for paddy.
(4). I do not know what fallacy, real or imaginary, Mr. Farrar is here
attacking. Everyone knows, and has known for many years, that Tanagers
can be kept quite easilj 7 on a diet of fruit and any good soft-food. Surely
no modern writer has asserted the contrary ?

THE DONG-TAIEED COMBASOU.

Some two years ago I had one, and I made a note of it at the time, in the

Sir,--I f Mr. D. Seth-Smitli, who reported on the British Birds at the
last Crystal Palace .Show, had seen my Cuckoo when I bought him, he
might justly have called him a miserable 3'oung Cuckoo--his breast-bone
was almost through his skin, and he was so weak that he could not fly 011
to a perch a foot from the aviary floor. Seeing the wretchedness of the
poor bird, I made him a hay nest in a wicker basket and fed him on
*chopped mealworms with my fingers. I had him near to me at night, so
.that I could conveniently feed him as soon as it was light in the morning;
he got on wonderfully well and can now fly about the aviar}&apos;.
My object in caging him for the Show was not to get a prize (as I
knew his rough plumage would debar him from that) but to give the public
a chance of seeing a Cuckoo--and very interested they seemed in him. His
cage was a small one, but I don't think this would cause him a.ny misery, as
he very rarely stirs from his perch, although he is in an aviary about 15 feet
.square and 18 feet high.
I will admit this much--it is folly to keep such a bird, simply because
it gives one so little pleasure. Mine never utters a sound except when he
is fighting for his food : his noise then is very much like the hissing of a
Goose. He is very laz} r , and never bathes. In fact, I have come to the
conclusion that the Cuckoo is a dirty, dull, uninteresting bird, and hardly

(e) The Eoug-tailed Combasou, belonging&apos; to Mr. Fulljames, is distinguished from the
Common Combasou not only by the length of its tail but by the colour of its beak, which
is dark even when in full plumage. For this reason no careful observer could possibly
imagine the bird to be a mere sport, as Mr. Farrar seems to have thought his was. Can
Mr. Farrar's bird have been something different after all ?--Ed.

Sir,--R eferring to tlie report on the Doves and Soft-billed Birds at the
Palace Show, the pair of Rose-coloured Pastors were adult birds (Class 64).
It was surprising to me to find how quickly these birds change their
plumage. When I entered them for the Show they were a lovely rose colour,
as bright as when bought for me (with a number of other birds) by a friend,
in one of the Calcutta bazaars, in April last. Just before the Show, they
began to change, and in two or three days the lovely rose tint had quite gone,
and they looked quite different birds, being a grey colour, and having the
appearance of being young birds.
The rarest of my nineteen exhibits at the Palace Show was a pair of
Garrulous Honey-eaters (V.H.C.) in fine plumage, shown in a very large
cage ; only once before have I ever seen these birds exhibited at the Palace :
a pair was exhibited at the February Show, and took first prize in a large
class of 31 entries, including Toucans, Shamas, and Blue-cheeked Barbets --
I exhibited a very fine Blue-clieeked Barbet (V.H.C.) in this class--this year
all the above were put before the Honey-eaters.
I had four of these birds, quite tame, and they would feed from my
hand. A few days since, the aviary door, by some means, was left open, and
two escaped; these flew about my garden and looked like Cuckoos 011 the
wing. The next day I put out a cage with food in it, and one went in and
allowed me to walk up and close the door ; the other, after flying about for
two days, disappeared. It being so tame, I hope someone caught it, so that
it escaped the claws of some marauding cat.

BIRD-BOARDERS.
Sir, --Perhaps some of our members who have boarded-out cage-
birds will kindly inform me if the following charges, per week, are
unusually high : Song-birds, single, 8d. to gd., and pairs 1 /-; large species
I/- to 1/6 each.
My birds have been kept in splendid condition at these rates, but
some of my friends think them excessive.

Sir, --In reading Dr. Simpson's account of the Foreign Finches at
Palace Show, I regret to find that he thinks it unlikely the Committee of
the F. B. E. L. will consider it worth their while to provide these classes
(by which I presume he means Classes 50 and 53) at any future Show. I,
for one, hope the Committee will provide them, as I believe they will
become two of the best-filled in the Show. It will take time for them to
get known. I believe they came as a surprise to man} 7 owners of common
birds, and the consequence was they had not time to get their birds into
show condition and provide suitable cages. I believe that if the Green
Avadavat, African Fire Finch, Lavender Finch, and Cordon Bleu were
transferred to Class 50 it would give more satisfaction. I hope other
members will give us their ideas.

AND OF AN ANALOGOUS AMERICAN BIRD

assigning to the male of our common Purple Honeysucker
(Arachnecthra asiatica ) (x) besides its characteristic dress, a
plumage much resembling that of the female, but marked with a
broad purple streak down the ventral surface. Dr. H. Gadow, how-
ever,in the British Museum Catalogue volmne(IX.,p.58) dealing
with these birds, ignores this change of plumage ; and Mr. Oates,
in his " Birds of British Burmah," (Vol. I., p. 322) states that the
change does not take place in that country, " for full-plumaged
males may be obtained all the year round." He believes also
that the young males of this species are clothed in female
plumage all through their first winter, and thinks that the
abundance of such has probably given rise to the belief in a
change of plumage.
With all due deference to the opinion of so excellent an
ornithologist as Mr. Oates, I venture to suggest that he is
wrong, and that the authors previously cited are right, with
respect to this change of plumage, at any rate in Indian
examples.
In the first place, the presence of full-plumaged birds all
the year round is of very little weight in disproving this change.

Marked individual variations occur ill the period of change of
plumage by birds which possess more than one dress, and
specimens of such species may be found in more or less full
plumage and undress at the same date, as I have myself seen
in Ducks and Dabchicks.
This consideration disposes, I think, of Mr. Oates' first
argument, but I have better evidence to bring forward.
About the middle of July last year (1897) i&apos; 1 view of my
approaching visit to England on leave, I procured a number of
Houeysuckers in the hope of being able to take some alive to
the Eondon Zoological Gardens, where such birds have never
previously been exhibited. All the birds I kept, with one
exception, were ArachrMfthra zeylonica (y), but I had, andbrought
home safely, one male specimen of the species I am now
considering.
This bird, when I got it, was in heavy moult, and mostly
purple in colour, but to my great surprise (I had taken it for a
young male assuming full plumage) it gradually lost its hue,
and by the time I started for England, in the first week in
August, it was in the non-breeding dress, brown above and
yellow below, with the median purple streak, but still retaining
the orange axillary tufts.
This specimen, unfortunately, only survived its advent at
the Zoological Gardens for about a fortnight (z) and I do not
know whether it was preserved ; if it was, it was probably put in
spirit, as the moult had never been properly completed, and so
the plumage was in bad order. It had, however, lived long
enough to show that the change above referred to does really
take place ; for that captivity could have so affedted the bird as
to change the colour of the actually growing feathers, I am not
(y) Cinnyris zeylonica of the Cat. Brit. Birds Mus. -- E d.
(z) I ascribe my small measure of success with living Sunbirds to the fact that I fed
them too much on " slops''--sweetened milk or milk-sop. In addition to some such food
given at first it would, I think, be well to supply crumbled yolk of hard-boiled egg mixed
with powdered sugar, and to keep them on this as much as possible, with fruit also. None
of my specimens of Arachnecthra zeylonica survived the voyage but one, and this died in
the train en route from Plymouth to London. I saw this bird bullying the A. asiatica on one
occasion, at least, and I had previously noticed that the latter bird appeared somewhat to
fear its companions. When all were together in a big cage in Calcutta, it kept almost entirely
to one twig in the branch put in this cage, and was in general less active in its movements
than A. zeylonica , though it seemed less sensitive to cold on the voyage. None of the male
A. zeylonica, some of which were moulting, showed any sign of changing their bright
plumage for a duller one, as suggested by Captain Shelley in his account of the species in
the Monograph above quoted. Neither did they molest each other, while I remember
having had to separate two male specimens of A. asiatica which I had previously kept,
because one was getting so badly bullied by the other. -- F. F.

inclined to admit, and I, therefore, conclude that the accounts
which give this bird a change of plumage are quite correct.
While on this subject, it seems to me that I may draw
the attention of ornithologists to a similar change, apparently
hitherto unrecorded, in a bird which, though not believed to be
allied to our Suubirds, and inhabiting the New World, never-
theless in form and habits presents at least an analogous
resemblance to these. I allude to the Yellow-winged Blue
Sugar-bird (Ccereba cyanea ) of which several specimens have
been exhibited in the London Zoological Society's Gardens.
During my previous acquaintance with the species there,
I had been struck by the change of plumage that the male
appeared to undergo, and, when in England last September, I
found the Society's specimen, a male which had been acquired
so long ago as 1890, actually passing into the full violet plumage
from the undress stage, which had been olive-green above, and
yellowish below, much resembling the coloration of the female.
The tail was black, the wings yellow and black, and the legs
pink-red, as in the male in full plumage. In fact, the bird
presented much the same appearance as a skin in the Indian
Museum collection, except that there were many more violet
feathers visible.
The keepers I consulted bore me out as to the regular
\0x25A0occurrence of the change of plumage in the male of this species,
and one was of the opinion that the quills and tail changed also;
but this I do not recollect seeing n^self. Unfortunately this
bird also soon after died, and was not preserved.
The existence of this change of coloration in the male
\0x25A0of a Ccereba is interesting as tending to confirm the views of
those naturalists (Dr. Scalter and Messrs. Baird, Brewer, and
Ridgway) who place the Ccerebidce in close connection with the
Tanagers, in which group the male of Pyranga rubra exhibits a
.similar seasonal alteration of plumage (a).

AMAZONS.
After Conurus, Brotogerys ought to follow, but I have
never kept any of that genus. I intend to do so some day, for
they seem to be tameable little things, with a certain capacity
for speech, but the convenient season has not arrived yet. I
suggested to Mr. Phillipps, who has kept them, that he should
fill up the gap, but I have not heard that he has consented to do
so. I have been told they are noisy, otherwise I should have
thought they ought to be more popular than Red-rumps and
that tribe, for they are much more human.
The Amazons form a large subjedt: even of them, I dare
say there are two-thirds that I have not kept. I divide them in
my own mind into three classes--1st, the large; 2nd, the medium;
3rd, the small.
I do not know that the large contains more than fivespecies,.
viz., Chrysotisguildingi, C. farinosa, C. inomata , C. augusta, and
C. bouqueti. Three of these guildingi , augusta , and bouqueti, are
very rare ; the first is confined to the Island of St. Vincent, and
the last two to that of Dominica. I have wondered what effect the
late hurricane may have had on guildingi. We were told by the
correspondent of the Times that all the trees had been destroyed,
and all the winged insedls. One could not help wondering if
C. guildingi might not have gone to swell the number of extinbt
species.
I am not sure that I have ever seen C. bo 7 iqueti and C.
augusta: C.guildingi I have not only seen at the Zoo, but very
nearly had. They are, as I have said, confined to the Island of
St. Vincent,and a clergyman, to whom I wrote, told me that they
were only got by being shot, when, if the wound was not mortal,,
they were caged. There was a hen-bird shot near him, which was
so far tamed that it learned to answer " Alec," to the question
" Who shot you ? " Soon after he told me this, he wrote that his
son had shot one which was absolutely uninjured, and which I
could have if I liked. I closed with the offer ; but just as I was
arranging for its transport, the bird managed to open its cage
and escaped. The negroes appear to make no effort, like the
Indians of South America, to take the young and bring them up :
consequently there does not seem much likelihood of anyone

being able to pronounce on the bird's capabilities as a talker, or
its recommendations as a pet. But if it be true that a hen shot
when adult yet learned to talk, I should say the species must have
latent talking powers of no mean order. I tried to find out how
the male and female birds were distinguished, but have had no
answer. The British Museum Catalogue describes them as alike.
Considering how very unlikely it is that any of my readers
should be able to acquire a specimen, it may be doubted if it is
worth while for me to give a description ; but it is larger than the
Mealy Amazon, and the handsomest I have seen. The prevailing
colour is brown, shading into yellow. The forehead is white,
the back of the head blue. The red in an ordinary Amazon's
wing is replaced by orange, and the wings are partly blue ; in
fact, it is the only Amazon which is a brown rather than a green
bird. The beak is white.
As to augusta, the Zoological Gardens, according to its
1883 Bist, appear only to have had one ; and never a bouqueti, so
it is not surprising that I should not have seen one.
There remain, then, C. farinosa, and C. inornata. These
are only to be distinguished by the yellow spot on the head of
farinosa. They are almost entirely green, larger than the Double-
fronted, and quite unmistakable from the powdery appearance
of their feathers--to which fa? r i?iosa owes its name. I see so little
difference between them that it is difficult to think they can be
two species. I kept two : I think one of each kind--but I found
them very unattractive. They were noisy, and though not wild,
would not learn a word. Of course, a species cannot be judged
by two specimens, both of which may have been hens ; and Dr.
Russ, though giving them a bad character for screaming, says
they are among the most talented. As the other larger parrots,
the Double-fronted and Golden-naped for instance, are amongst
the best talkers, it may be very possible that I chanced on two
hens. I was offered one once, which was said to be an excellent
talker, but I think I could not have it on approval; I know
there was some sufficient reason for my not buying it. Still, if
anyone has the chance of buying one, and is not siire that it is a
good talker, I would not advise his giving more than #2 for it;
I gave that for mine, and found it dear at the money.
Since writing the above, I have heard from my correspon-
dent in St. Vincent. He writes :
" My son says that the male-bird (of guildingi ) is less

gaudy than the female, but if in a specimen green predominates,
it is a male ; but at the same time there are male-birds as brilliant
as females. I myself do not think his distinction is clear, and the
usual belief is that the difference between the sexes cannot be
defined. However, the boy is positive that he knows how to
distinguish them often, if not always. The hurricane having
destroyed many forest-trees, the Parrots are seen all along the
coast, looking for food, and many have gone to Santa Rucia. I
fancy there has been a great destruction of them, and several
have been caught too weak from starvation to escape when
pursued. My son went into the neighbourhood of forests on
the 22nd November, but although he saw many, they had
strength to fly away."

THE EUROPEAN ROLLER.
( Coracias gdrrulusJ.
By Reginald Phileipps.

<bodyText confidence="0.997081" page_id="32638413"  page_num="Page 46" year="" vol="">
In the April and May numbers of the Avicultural Magazine,
1898, I wrote about the European Roller, and referred specially
to the possible abstention from water of the species in its wild
state. And in connection with this point, at page 122, I added,
" I have not ever known a Roller knowingly touch water on the
ground, nor ever attempt to wash anywhere; but they will spread
out their wings and feathers during a shower in warm weather."
I11 my garden there is a rather large bathing saucer, surrounded
at a distance of from two to four feet by a wooden rail about a
foot from the ground. On May 4th, 1898, a mild showery day
here, the two Rollers with outstretched wings were enjoying the
rain on a high perch, in the manner referred to above. Suddenly
the male came down and, from the rails, dashed violently into the
water several times, returning to the rails after each dash. The
female quickly joined him, and, excited by his mad behaviour,
likewise from the rails, dashed at and just over the water
repeatedly but without actually touching it; and then, as the
absurdity of the proceeding seemed to strike her, she burst into
one of her wild Jackass laughs, and flew right away off to the
shelter of the bird-room. The dash of the male into the water
was of the true Kingfisher plunge, and identical with that of the
Raughing Jackass, Dacelo gigas. On July 6th, the plumage of
both birds indicated a recent tubbing which I did not witness ;
but just a week later I again saw them bathing. Having pre-

sumably learned from experience that taking headers into a
shallow dish (I have literally trembled with concern at the sight
of a Laughing Jackass taking his dip) is not unattended with
disadvantages, they now acted quite differently ; and instead of
plunging into the water they hovered over it like Gulls and
gently dropped into it. Probably they did not take more than
four baths during the whole summer: I can speak only for three,
but perhaps my aviary is cold for them. It would seem, then,
that both the Roller and the Laughing Kingfisher, the great
land Kingfisher of Australia, take their baths naturally with a
true Kingfisher plunge, which is all the more remarkable as
neither species seeks its prey in the water in the wild state.
They both will feed upon lizards, occasional^ bang their victims
against a bough with great violence, and gulp their prey down
whole like the Kingfisher. They both nest in holes, holes of
trees from preference, and they lay white eggs.
During the summer I.noticed from the marks in the sand
in two of the houses in the bird-room that some large bird was
frequently taking sand-baths ; and on August ist I found that it
was the female Roller. I cannot say whether the male likewise
indulged in this pastime.
I have more than once referred to the "Jackass" laugh
of my female Roller. By this expression I do not mean any of
the common notes of the species, but a laugh remarkably like
that of the Laughing Jackass--as the Laughing Kingfisher is
familiarly called--only shorter. When my female first arrived she
laughed frequently, being immensely astonished and delighted
with her new home--and small wonder, when one thinks of the
tiny all-wire cage from which I rescued her, which she shared
with a couple of Scops Owls f Scops giu ). Since those early days
her laugh has been very rare, for it seems to be uttered only
when something intensely comical or startling excites her risible
faculties. I cannot say that I have ever heard the male laugh in
the same way. There are very expressive substitutes for a
laugh, though, from both male and female when they notice that
the other birds are being served with breakfast or supper. And
directly I appear with their saucers and call their names, the
female flies to meet me, settles on the edge of her saucer, and,
throwing her head upwards and backwards and bowing it up and
down, utters a shout of triumph, or let us say of thanks, and
falls- to, never pausing for a moment while I walk across the
room and place the saucer, with its double burden of food and
feeder, in its accustomed place. The male usually precedes us,

but to the house beneath that of his wife,--for it would be about
as wise to feed two bull-terriers out of the same dish as a couple
of Rollers. They are very conservative birds, and like every-
thing to be just as they have been accustomed to find it; any
change or any new arrangement they regard with the gravest
suspicion.
Like so many other species, the Roller occasionally throws
up pellets of undigested portions of its food.
For a considerable time the terror inspired in the aviary at
the sight of these birds on the wing was very great, especially
among the Parrakeets. But notwithstanding their predatory
appearance when flying, I have found them most inoffensive
creatures if kindly treated, excepting towards their own relatives.
On the other hand, my Rollers would allow themselves to be
greatly worried and tormented by the Struthideas (Struthidea
cineria) and the Satin Bower-bird.
In April and May of 1898, they made several attempts at
nesting, and became very excitable. Their most serious designs
were made on a log-nest in which a Redrump was sitting.
Several attempts were made by the two birds to obtain a footing
here, the female always leading the assault and perching in the
aperture. On their approach the male Redrump would dash into
the log like a flash, in order to aid in the defence. Later, they
again made for this log; and the female, sitting in the aperture
and swaying her tail up and down, would roar with laughter on
finding that it was tenantless, while the male, close behind her,
would chuckle with suppressed glee. But nothing came of it,
probably because of the Satin Bower-bird, though possibly
because they may have been too young : for the yearlings of
some large species will not do more than play at nesting--at
least that is my experience.
As has been pointed out, the Roller is very like the
Laughing Kingfisher in many of its habits, movements, and
ways ; and it has the habit (as has also Dacelo gigas if I
remember rightly) of slowly swaying its tail up and down after
alighting on a perch, when sitting on one's hand, and at other
times when in an uncertain mood or at all aroused. It is a bird
of the sun ; and in dull or foggy weather, of which we have
plenty here in London, it seems much disposed to mope. When
at rest it squats on its perch, never, I think, standing on one leg.
The two, although friendly, never cuddle together side by side.
Mr. Meade-Waldo, who is well-acquainted with the species

in its wild state and also in captivity, once told me that in Spain
they frequent the vineyards for the purpose of feeding on the
smaller lizards, etc., which they invariably swallow whole, and
in the same manner that the Kingfisher swallows fish, and that
in captivity they will eat small fish. He likewise stated that
they have a fall spring moult and also an autumnal moult.
Neither of my present birds moulted in 1897, their year of birth.
From January to March, 1898, the female moulted fully and the
male partially : but the latter recommenced moulting towards
the end of Odtober, and the female has since followed suit.
Mr. Howard Saunders says of this species in his
Illustrated Manual of British Birds , " The food consists of
beetles and other insects captured on the ground." In the
summer, when my birds were frequently in the garden--for the
Roller must have plenty of space if it is to have a chance--I found
that when I tossed mealworms to the male he caught them in
the air nearly as cleverly as the Drongo (Disseinurus paradiseusJ
does, from which circumstance I should feel disposed to say,
even without further evidence, that the species takes its food
occasionally in the air. I have read somewhere, or have been
told, perhaps by Mr. Meade-Waldo, that the Roller (I understood
the European Roller to be referred to) is in the habit of following
flights of locusts for the purpose of feeding on them, taking
them in the air quite readily.
Mr. Meade-Waldo, in a letter dated 16U1 April, 1898,
mentioned a curious circumstance : " I have a splendid male
(European Roller) in an aviary here ; he has assumed perfedt
adult breeding plumage. He has always fed voraciously on
chopped birds, mice, cockroaches, mealworms, lizards, etc., but
now, for no apparent reason beyond a strong migratory impulse,
he has refused all food for ten days (I learned afterwards that
this fast lasted a fortnight) ; he is in perfect health, strong, and
looks hard, just as if he was on his full diet. I imagine he must
be living 011 some great store of internal fat, which is provided
to carry him through his migrations. He is quite tame, in a
large and very warm outdoor aviary, in company with two pairs
of Sand Grouse and a pair of Trumpeter Bullfinches."
My male holds himself up better than the female, and
seems to be a stouter bird. He is also a good deal the more

(Monticola saxatilis).
By the Rev. Hubert D. Astley, F.Z.S.
In the spring of 1891, in the month of May, I reared up
from the nest a brood of Rock Thrushes, one of which I still
have in perfect condition and health : a male bird, hatched in
Northern Italy amongst the rocks where the mountains rise up
from one of the greater lakes towards the Swiss frontier. Mr.
Seebohm has described the haunts of the Rock Thrush as
embracing some of the wildest of scenes. " Its summer home
is amongst the rocky gorges of the mountains, in and amongst
the old ruins, ravines, and rough broken ground strewed with
rock fragments, with here and there a few stunted trees or
bushes. . . . His winter home in Africa is in the neighbour-
hood of the Arab burial places, on the borders of the arid desert,
the vast and trackless Sahara, the gorges, embankments, rocky
bluffs and ravines, and the oases of the desert."
In June of 1897, I visited a haunt of these beautiful birds
in France amongst the glorious hills of Auvergne, a spot where,
just above the carriage road, a scattered mass of boulders had
been thrown as it were by a giant hand on to the grassy slope ;
and there, besides some wheatears and pipits of sorts, was quite
a small colony of Rock Thrushes. I counted four or five males in
full plumage, in addition to females and fully fledged young ones.
The males were running after each other over the rocks, puffing
out their feathers and singing every time they settled afresh, their
rufous-coloured tails in constant vibration after the manner of
Redstarts.
With regard to rearing these birds from the nest, I have
personally not found any difficulty. Cleanliness is most
important. I kept the young ones, which, when first taken,
were just beginning to have a good growth of feathers, in a
covered basket on fresh hay, taking care to shake the droppings
away so that there should be no accumulation near the birds.
The hay was either freshly shaken out each morning, or else
entirely renewed. When doing so, I simply placed the young
Thrushes on a piece of flannel, and by handling them gently
day by day, and talking to them, accustomed them to my touch,
so that, to this day, the bird I have will fly on to my hand when
loose in a room, and will there sing. I fed them upon a mixture
of insectivorous food with some fresh and finely-chopped raw

beef added, allowing them, as soon as they could hop about, to
dabble round a saucer of water on the floor of the room.
They loved very early in life to hop into the shallow water
and wash in a babyish fashion, and by this means they kept
their feet clean.
In the autumn their plumage was much the same as the
adult female. A pretty speckled brown, the feathers having pale
margins, the breast of a warmer yellow, the tail rufous.
Males of a year old, or even two years old, in summer
plumage, are not nearly so brilliant as they are in their third and
consecutive years.
My Rock Thrush has always moulted most regularly and
most thoroughly in August or even the latter end of July, and
again in February, perhaps commencing towards the end of
January. At the beginning of March he is in full and perfect
breeding plumage. He has always been so regular in this
latter respect, however cold the weather may have been, that I
imagine one would find his relations who are at liberty in Africa
changing their feathers at precisely the same time of the year.
The larger feathers of the wing and the tail feathers are
only grown once a year at the autumnal moult. My bird always
moults very rapidly, the feathers coming out in showers when
once he commences, and the new ones appearing very quickly.
Fast season his breeding plumage was beautifully defined. The
cobalt blue of his head and neck being sharply outlined against
the rich chestnut of the whole breast and under surface. The
pure white patch on the back is very conspicuous when he is out
of his cage and runs along the floor of the room with his body
feathers puffed out like an angry cat's fur, whilst he lowers his
head and depresses tightly the feathers on it.
The wings are brown ; the upper part of the back and the
shoulders being dark bluish grey ; the tail bright rufous, the
two centre feathers being browner. Round the eyes, which are
hazel, the skin becomes bright yellow as the breeding plumage
is assumed.
But what is most curious is the love song of the Rock
Thrush, with the accompanying attitudes and movements. My
bird treats me to this performance, and although he will go
through it whilst others are looking on (at a respectful distance),
I have never known him make love to anyone except n^self.
From March to July is the period during which he indulges in
these antics. It generally takes place on my entering the room

after an absence of an hour or more. He commences by throw-
ing his head upwards, his neck becoming extremely thin and
almost snake-like in appearance, and his whole body compressed,
whilst the wings are drooped, and the tail beautifully spread
into a broad fan, making it look three times its normal size. As
the bird commences these movements, he utters a quick low
warble, moving the head from side to side, the bill pointing
immediate^ upwards. Gradually the warble becomes louder
and faster until it would seem as if the notes could not come
fast enough, whilst at the same time the bird runs rapidly back-
wards and forwards in front of me, the tail spread and quivering
as he moves, the performance lasting about lialf-a-minute. This
undoubtedly would be his manner of attracting his wife (Y).
My bird has learnt to whistle a short impromptu tune
from me, which he will pipe out at any time of the day or night
if he even hears my voice in the distance. At times he will
fasten himself by his bill o&amp;gt;n to my hand and throw himself
apparently into a great rage, not suffering me to touch anything
in the room, and occasionally perching on my head with the
hopes of depriving me of my brains ; at least it feels like that! 1
If let out of his cage at breakfast time, he wall fly on to
the table and trip rapidly amongst the dishes, piping all the
time, and quite ready to seize your pat of butter! A most
charming bird. But this latter propensity in him may have
altered your opinion l
ON THE JAY AS A CAGE-BIRD.
B3^ Percy W. Farmborough, F.Z.S.
The Jay, so far as my experience has taught me, is a
most intelligent and interesting cage-bird, provided the cage be
sufficiently large. An acquaintance of mine, when I told him
in the course of a general conversation that I had a Jay, said
" What, have you got one of those filthy birds ? I had one, but
' never no more.' Why, do you know it is the dirtiest bird there
is 1 it is perfectly impossible to keep it clean ; we had it from a
relation in the country as a young bird ; we fed it on bread and
milk, and kept it in a nice cage which the wife cleaned out twice
a week, and yet, in spits of all our attention and care, it became
such a 'stinker' we had to give it away. I'll let you have the

cage cheap if you like ! " I thanked him for his offer, and said
that I was sorry that I was not in want of it. He replied, "Well,
I'll give it to you, I want to get rid of it."
A few days later the cage came to hand--a beautiful
arrangement of brass wire and inlaid wood, just about large
enough for the Jay to turn round in ; there was no room at all for
exercise, and really it was about the most unfit cage that could
have been used. I was not surprised, after hearing that the bird
was fed on bread and milk, that it was dirty, especially when the
cage was cleaned out only twice a week ; but when I saw the cage
I was simply astounded that a man had no more sense than to
keep a bird the size of a Jay in it. The smallest cage used by
the writer, for even such birds as Unnets, is 32 inches long by
34 inches high and 24 inches wide.
A cage for a Jay should certainly be not less than the
above size; the door should be a large one, so that the interior
can be cleaned out properly every day. A small door is an
abomination, as it prevents the free movement of the arm
inside the cage. Personally, I prefer the turn-rail to a sliding
tray. My^ objection to a sliding tray is that, after any length of
time, the splashing of water, caused by the bird when it bathes,
causes the wood to warp and stick, preventing the easy with-
drawal of the tray&apos;---the drawer of the cage, above mentioned,
when I tried to take it out, remained stuck to the cage, the brass
knob and veneered front coming away in my hand--whilst a
turn-rail has simply to be pulled open, and a scraper introduced
to effectually remove any excreta and refuse there may be.
The Jay f Gar ruins gland arms J is a bird which is familiar
to most dwellers in the country^, but town-folk know it as a rule
by pictures or stuffed specimens in the Natural History Museum.
In Dr. Butler's work on " British Birds," it is stated that
in Kent the nest of the Jay is rarely seen. In Shropshire, round
Delburyr (or more correctly, Diddlebury) I had no difficulty in
taking several nests, and although shot by keepers, the bird is a
*common one in the district. In Hertfordshire, too, the Jay is
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.6574785" page_id="32638420"  page_num="Page 53" year="" vol="">
fairly 7 - common, although, naturally, not to the extent it is in
Shropshire ( c ).
(c) I think I only twice, or at most three times, took the nest of this bird in Kent,
but I have seen as many as five birds together on the outskirts of a Kentish wood. The
*cage in which I keep my Jay measures 5 feet 3 inches long, 3 feet 4 inches high, 2 feet
deep ; my draw-trays are of zinc and I use plenty of sand and shingle. I do not find a
daily cleansing necessary, and there is no smell.--A. G, B.
I have repeatedly seen from 10 to 20 Jays cross a ride in a wood in Kent.--E-G.B. M.-W.

The young are easily hand-reared. My plan was to feed
them on barleymeal and ants'-eggs made into a crumbly paste
with raw hens'-eggs (without the shells, of course) and supple-
mented with pieces of raw meat. On this diet they throve
rapidly and developed into fine large birds.
The above food, with the addition of beetles and other
large insects, formed the diet when adult, and I am certain that
my Jays were in much better condition and plumage than that of
the gentleman mentioned above. I allowed my birds occasionally
to come out of the cage ; they got very tame and exceedingly
impudent--nearly as "cheeky" as a Jackdaw.

THE LIMITS OF LEGITIMATE AVICULTURE.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998524346153846" page_id="32638421"  page_num="Page 54" year="" vol="">
By H. R. Fiixmer.
No doubt all aviculturists are satisfied as to the morality
of keeping birds in captivity--the fact of their being aviculturists.
shews that they do not agree with the amiable enthusiasts who
consider it cruel and wicked. But of the general public who are
not aviculturists--the outsiders in fact--there is undoubtedly a
considerable section who are opposed to the capture of wild
birds for cage or aviary, and some, like Mr. W. H. Hudson, go
so far as even to condemn the keeping of Canaries.
We may rightly regard this as fanaticism, born of
sentimentality and ignorance, but at the same time we should
be wise if we do what we can to disarm criticism by dissociating
ourselves from certain practices for which aviculture may be
blamed, and which most of us regard as outside " the limits of
legitimate aviculture."
I should like it to be clearly understood that I am not
seeking to lay down the law as to what is legitimate and what is
illegitimate--the decision of every point as it arises must be left
to the good sense of the avicultural community--but merely to
indicate in a general way what I believe to be the tendency of
opinion among modern aviculturists.
I think the feeling is growing that we ought, as much as
possible, to encourage the keeping of birds in aviaries, and
discourage the use of cages. While if cages be used it is agreed
that they should be fairly large ones, and the abominable little
prisons still too often seen are generally condemned.

Some consider bird-shows cruel. With this I cannot
agree. Although I am not myself an exhibitor, I believe that
Shows have their uses, and on the whole do more good than
harm. But it must be conceded that many things connected
with Shows are capable of improvement from a humanitarian
point of view. The suggestion has been made that the Show
Committees should reserve power, under the rules, to disqualify
any exhibit sent in a cage which they consider too small or
otherwise cruelly unsuitable, and also to either remove the bird
into a proper cage until the close of the Show, or return it
immediately to the owner. I think that some such rule is really
necessary.
A larger and more important question (and the one which
I had chiefly in my thoughts when I chose the title for this
paper) is as to whether certain species and groups of birds are
not, by their very nature, so unsuited for captivity as to make
their confinement in itself an adt of cruelty. Personally I feel
bound to answer the question in the affirmative, and I should be
disposed to put a good many species " outside the limits." All
the species of Swallows seem most ill-adapted for life in cage or
aviary, and I think we ought to do all we can to discourage their
capture. There are other species, such as the Wren, the Chiff-
chaff, and the Willow-warbler, which endure captivity so badly
(chiefly because of food difficulties) that their capture seems
almost equally undesirable. If the secret of keeping these birds
in health could be discovered, the objection would vanish--but
so long as their confinement leads to the death of nine out of
ten within a few weeks, and ninety-nine out of a hundred
within a few months, it appears mere cruelty to cage them.
Another practice which we all agree in condemning is the
endeavouring to keep delicate insectivorous birds while un-
willing or unable to bestow upon them the care and attention,
and the somewhat expensive and troublesome food, which they
require. The keeping of such birds as the Nightingale is
perfectly legitimate, if they bt properly kept ; but such keeping
involves a considerable expenditure of both time and money,
and those who are not prepared to incur this should restrict
themselves to seed-eaters.
In writing these notes I have endeavoured to avoid undue
dogmatism. I hope my readers will understand that my object
is to suggest a line of thought, not to lay down a series of rules.

REVIEW.
Notes on Cage-Birds (Second Series) or Practical Hints on the
Management of British and Foreign Cage-Birds, Hybrids and
Canaries. By various Hands. Edited by W. T. Greene, M.A.,
M.D. (L. Upcott Gill. Price 6 I~J.
This is a reprint in book form of " a selection from the
various articles, letters, and notes relating to Cage-Birds, that
have appeared in the Bazaar from 1882 (when the First Series
was issued) to the present day."
Such a book as this must necessarily be of a rather
scrappy and hap-hazard character, but it contains a good deal of
information worthy of preservation in more permanent form
than the columns of a newspaper, and we think aviculturists
will find it interesting.
The fact that every letter in the book is signed either by
initials or by a nom deplume detracts somewhat from its value.
The statements of an anonymous writer are not entitled to so
much weight as those of one who gives his name. Still, the
identity of H. D. A., F. G. D, R. P., C. P. A., W. T. C., J. H. V.,
W. O., and others, is sufficiently transparent, and to readers of
the Avicultural Magazine, at any rate, will be no mystery. The
letters appear to have been somewhat severely edited, so much
so, indeed, as to have lost nearly all individuality in the process.
Such an experienced journalist as Dr. Greene may be
trusted to make the most of the materials at his command, and
it is therefore scarcely needful to say that the book is well
arranged and eminently readable.
Two instances are here recorded of Spice-birds acquiring
the song of the Silver-bill, and Dr. Greene states " we have
frequently heard of cases of birds that naturally sing in dumb
show, or at least in such a low tone as to be inaudible to ordinary
human ears, acquiring the notes of other w 7 arblers, and singing
aloud." We remember a Chestnut Finch (for some years in Dr.
Simpson's possession) which sang a full, loud song, much like
that of a Canar} 7 . By the way, to describe the song of the
typical Mannikins as "inaudible to ordinary human ears" seems
somewhat of an exaggeration--it is very faint, but perfectly
audible if the listener be near enough to the performer.

THE MADAGASCAR WEAVER.

Sir,--M r. Cresswell asks for the experiences of other members
concerning the temper of the Madagascar Weaver. May I, without
presuming to lay down any general law, give my experience.
Several years ago I bought a fine specimen and placed him in a large
cage with a numerous collection of Waxbills and small finches. He proved
to be the most amiable of birds, and remained for many months without
causing any unpleasantness to his cage-mates, even allowing liimseif to be
driven away from the seed-vessels by the smallest Waxbills. I afterwards
gave him to a friend, who placed him in a cage with a similar collection of
small finches. Here he proved himself a veritable demon, and had to be
speedily removed to solitary confinement, where he eventually died. Why
he should have behaved so differently in very similar surroundings I do not
know. I have often seen this species kept in cages and aviaries with other
smaller birds, and, as far as my experience goes, it is generally an inoffensive
bird. C. S. Simpson.
Sir,--I have had a Madagascar Weaver in my bird-room for about
eight years. I formerly had two, as well as a Comoro Weaver; the latter
killed one of the Madagascar birds and became so quarrelsome and danger-
ous in 1897 that I had to remove it. The single male Madagascar Weaver
is still in the same aviary with a mixed collection; it quarrels with Java
Sparrows and Saffron-finches and sometimes chases other Weavers, but
hurts nothing: young or small birds seem to be beneath its notice.
A. G. Butper.
Sir,--R eplying to Mr. Cresswell's query respecting this active and
showy bird, from my own experience I should not hesitate to put one male
amongst other birds, in even a moderate sized aviary, providing they all
have sufficient roosting accommodation.
So far circumstances have compelled me to keep all my birds in
cages, one of which contains a very mixed lot; which system has the one
advantage that for over two years I have been able to study&apos; their little
ways very closely&apos;. For twelve months I had a very&apos; bold healthy&apos; Madagas-
car Weaver in an ordinary single breeding-cage, 30 x 16 x 9 inches, along
with two small Napoleons--one of these a very quiet inoffensive bird, and
the other, though very&apos; active, very harmless. Half a cocoauut was
suspended from each back corner ; the two Napoleons always roosted on
the edge of one, and the Foudia 011 the other. Even in this small cage the
Foudia never quarrelled with the others although it resented their presence
on its own cocoanut, driving them off with a fierce little cry. Since then I
have made them a box-cage, 3 feet 6 inches square by 16 inches deep, with
a half cocoauut in one top corner, a Hartz Canary-cage in the other, and
two large forked apple-branches for perches. In this, for ten mouths, the
same Foudia, Napoleons, and a Ribbon-fincli have lived peaceably, though
never a day passes without my hearing the excited shrill cry of the Mada-
gascar ejecting trespassers from the Hartz-cage, which it has been pleased
to appropriate.

I am not surprised to hear of Mr. Cresswell's experience with the
Gouldian-finch. I have found the cock Gouldian so thoroughly meek as to
be quite powerless against the fierce onslaughts of a vicious little Bronze
Mannikin about a quarter of its own size, though the hen Gouldian has
often stepped between and driven off the tormentor.
I don't think two Madagascar cocks would agree in a small space. I
had another when using the smaller cage, and all went well until one day
it became rather ill and weak, and the first one killed it (d).
They seem indifferent to cold after being acclimatized. I had no heat
in the room last winter, and, strange to say, the one I have shed its beautiful
scarlet coat for the first time this November, being in half colour when I
bought him twenty months ago. A. A. Pearson.

CRIMSON FINCHES.

<bodyText confidence="0.996959638888889" page_id="32638425"  page_num="Page 58" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- Perhaps the following may be interesting re Crimson Finches :
To one of my friends in N. E. Queensland, who had often sent me birds, I
had several times written, " Please send me all the Crimson Finches you
can get." They were very scarce in that district, and for a long time I got
other birds but no Crimson Finches; until a letter came which was quite a
surprise to me, saying : " At last 1 hope to please you by sending a good
number of Blood Finches (the Queensland name for the Crimson Finch) ; the
trappers have taken quite a large number, and I am sending, via Brisbane,
eleven-aud-a-half dozen." These were put on board one of the mail
steamers in charge of an officer who was a friend of mine; he enclosed
the bill, which was by far the largest amount I ever paid at one time for
foreign birds -- lie had paid a good price for them, as someone in Sydney had
offered a high price.
My friend had been more than kind : I wanted Crimson Finches, but
not such a number, for although my aviaries were large I was puzzled to
know what I should do with one hundred and fort)&apos; of these birds.
Unfortunately the ship was overrun with rats, and my friend had
the greatest difficulty in protecting the birds from these midnight marauders;
from this, and another unforeseen circumstance, he lost more than half on
the voyage home---just sixty birds reached me.
In a large aviary these birds were most peaceable, but on putting a
pair into a waggon-shaped cage with other birds, the first day the cock
Crimson Finch broke the leg of the only hen Parrot Finch I had--the leg
was hanging by the skin only; this bird lived some months after with only
one leg. In a large aviary they will agree ; but in a small one, or in a cage,
they are the most combative of small birds, especially at breeding-time.
James B. Housden.
Sir, -- I think it is undoubtedly a " fallacy" for the Rev. C. D. Farrar
to assume, because his specimens were peaceable, that good temper is
\0x25A0characteristic of the species. I have had several specimens and made
frequent attempts to keep them with other small finches, but they would
certainly have killed every bird smaller than themselves, had they been
permitted to remain among them. On one occasion I removed a pair
(d) A bird which will thus kill another (when not breeding) is, we should say, too
dangerous to be trusted in a mixed aviary. This experience of Mr. Pearson's does not
support the advice given in the first paragraph of his letter.--E d.

of Crimson Finches, which had lived together for more than a year in
perfect friendship, from their usual cage to a smaller one. The next
morning I found the cock had most cruelly attacked and nearty killed the
hen, apparently because he did not like the change of residence.

THE " LONG-TAILED COMBASOU."
Sir,--U nless I am very blind, Mr. Fulljames' bird is not wholly dark,
but has white at any rate on the flanks; and I take it to be a specimen of
the Resplendent Wlivdah, Vidua hypocherina (&amp;lt;?).
Will not Mr. Fulljames, in the cause of aviculture, give us further
particulars, and especially of the changes of plumage--if any ?
And cannot Mr. Farrar sa}&apos; whether there are, or were, any white
feathers under the wings of his bird, and whether only the four central or
all of the tail feathers were elongated ? Probably it was also a Resplendent
Whydah ; and particulars of a rare bird are always valuable.

HYBRIDS.
Sir, --Last season I bred Canary mules from a cock Alario Finch, and
also from a cock Grey-necked Serin Finch. I have two cock mules (one
of each cross) which are perfectly charming songsters. The Grey-necked
Serin mule (a rich jonque from a deep yellow Norwich hen) is an unusually
handsome bird. E. D. H. Dary.

Sir, --Can any member, acquainted with European wild birds,
identify two kinds from very meagre descriptions ?
Last September, whilst walking with a camera down the road high
above theVal d'Herens, leading from Evolena to Sion, Switzerland (height
about 4,000 feet), I saw a lot of little Finch-like birds, about the size of
Siskins or St. Helena Waxbills, flitting about in the brilliant sunshine, and
uttering a very mellow flute-like call-note. I just caught sight of one for
a few seconds on a tree-bough, and it seemed almost olive-green, but more
yellowish underneath; I noticed a dark brown or black band across the
throat, like the crimson line on a Ribbon Finch, perhaps not extending
quite so far round. This momentary glimpse was the only one vouchsafed
me. The climate at that time was very hot during the day and very cold
at night.
(f) I came to this conclusion when I saw the bird at the Palace Show; but the
illustration of the species in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society gives it a scarlet
beak ; which is incorrect.--A. G. B.

About a week before, standing near the top of the Brevent, at
Chamonix (nearly 8,000 feet high), we saw, up in the sky, at a great height,
apparently considerably above the summit of Mont Blanc--which would
mean an elevation of over 3 miles--a flock of birds, which at that distance
looked like a lot of Black Crows. Whilst watching them in a motionless
mass, they began to drop, one by one, as by gravity, with such rapidity as
to suggest being dashed to pieces on the rocks below, but when quite near
the latter they used their wings to skim off horizontally, and settled for the
night on the rocks, perhaps 100 or 200 feet below the actual summit of the
Brevent, thus roosting nearly 8,000 feet above the sea level. They must
have dropped 7,000 or 8,000 feet without a flap of the wing (/).
Whilst ascending the Brevent in the morning, we had heard a short
plaintive whistle repeated frequently, which I certainly mistook for the
well-known cry of the Marmot. A week after, wandering alone on a very
elevated mountain-path, high above the south side of the Rhone valley, I
heard the same cry, accompanied by a rustling amongst the bushes, and,
directly afterwards, saw one of these Crow-like birds darting from one low
bush to another as I went along, though I only caught sight of it in its
flight. At close quarters it seemed a brown colour, and not nearly so large
as a Crow -- more like a Starling or Blackbird for size.
This is very vague information, but some practised ornithologist
might possibly recognise the birds by the locality, etc. A. A. Pearson.

Sir,--A short time ago I received a letter from one of our members--\0x25A0
Lieut. B. Horsbrugh, of the Arnij^ Service Corps stationed at Sierra Leone,---
containing some notes which will doubtless interest our readers He says :
" The commonest bird in Cape Coast is a large Yellow Weaver, the Rufous-
necked, I believe; there is a tree which is a regular sight (it is near my
quarters) a huge silk-cotton, and cannot contain less than eight or ten
thousand nests ; the birds are coming and going in swarms all day, and the
noise is deafening: the males are very quarrelsome and have a habit of
coming to an acacia here, biting the soft green leaves off and flying to
their nests with them. I see them frequently hang upside down at the
mouth of the nest, flapping their wings while the}' arrange the inside of it.
Some I have caged are fairly tame, and I will try to bring them home: if
you care for a pair I will send them to you on arrival.
" In the same tree there is another smaller Weaver, with a black face
and yellow breast and head ; there are not many of them, and I have not
seen enough of them to describe them more fully.
"Another common bird here is the Gre}Mieaded Sparrow (P. diffustts)
which I recognized from your description in the Avicultural Magazine : I
have had several caged, but they are very handy at dying unnecessarily.
" There is a small Waxbill with red rump, cheeks and bill, very
common here, and another little bird about the same size, with a reddish
breast, evidently a Waxbill.
" Plenty of the small Whydali with long tail and red beak are to be
seen in the grassy parts near here--they seem to delight in hunting the
Waxbills whenever they see them.
" I took three Grey Parrots out of a hole in a tree, and have reared
them up to date." A. G. BuTEER.

THE RUFOUS-TAILED GRASSFINCH.
Bathilda ruficauda.
By D. Seth-Smith, F.Z.S.

<bodyText confidence="0.979150533333333" page_id="32638430"  page_num="Page 61" year="" vol="">
The subject of our plate this month is a rare and very
beautiful little finch which inhabits (so the British Museum
Catalogue informs us) "North Western and Northern Australia,
Queensland, New South Wales and the interior of Australia."
Being thus widely distributed over the Australian Continent, it
is strange that living specimens should not be more frequently
imported into Europe than they are at present.
Very little indeed appears to be known of the habits of
Bathilda ruficauda in a wild state. Gould observed it amongst
rushes in marshy situations along the sides of streams, and
collected specimens on the Liverpool Plains and along the banks
of the Rivers Mokai and Namoi.
About the commencement of the year 1894 a few pairs of
the " Starfinch," as the species is called in Australia, were
received by a London bird-dealer, who naturally asked very
high prices for them. The following year several more living
specimens reached England ; and at the Crystal Palace Show
in February, 1896, no less than four pairs of Rufous-tails were
exhibited.
No specimens have, to the writer's knowledge, been
imported since, and at the present time this little bird is, so far
as English aviculturists are concerned, one of the rarest of
foreign finches. The present writer obtained a pair of these
birds in December, 1897, which had then been in England for
probably a year or more. They were not in the best of plumage,
and the cock had lost almost all the feathers from the back of
his head. They seemed, however, to be in good health, and
the cock spent most of his time, when not actually eating or
sleeping, in uttering, with outstretched neck, his peculiar little
pretence at a song.

This pair were placed in a warm aviary, and it soon
became evident that they wished to commence house-keeping :
they became bold towards their companions, and the cock would
now and then take a piece of hay in his bill, holding it at its
extreme end, and dance before his lady-love in a most grotesque
manner.
A nest-basket was neatly lined with hay, and the
operations of laying and hatching appeared to be progressing
in a satisfactory manner. Both birds were now decidedly
pugnacious towards any other bird that approached the nest,
dashing at all intruders, heedless of consequences. A Diamond
Dove had no more right near the nest than had the smallest
Waxbill, and each and all had to shift. However, in the case of
Bathilda mficmida, as with many other birds, the bark is worse
than the bite, and this little pair were never known to actually
inflict any bodily harm.
Days and weeks went by, but no youngsters made their
appearance ; surely it was quite time for them to show themselves
if, indeed, there were any there. One day both birds were seen
feeding at some distance from the nest and the opportunity w 7 as
taken to peep, as it was hoped, at the nestlings. Alas, however,
the nest contained no young Rufous-tails ; nothing, in fact, but
some minute fragments of egg-shell. The inference was clear
enough-- eggs had been laid and had been devoured, and by the
Rufous-tails themselves.
In May the pair was placed in a good-sized aviary in the
garden, and although some bitter weather (for the time of the
year) was experienced at the end of that month and the early
part of June, the cold did not appear to distress them in the
least; Amongst the branches that are thickly fastened against
the walls of the aviary, a domed nest was quickly constructed,
about the size and shape of an Ostrich's egg, and built in an
upright position. It was composed of hay, and lined with
feathers. The foundation was strongly built, but the dome was
a flimsy concern and the sitting bird could be seen through it.
Eggs were laid, but, as before, eaten : yet the hen (who was
probably the culprit) continued to sit diligently, and, whenever
she left the nest to feed, the cock would immediately take
possession of the imaginary eggs and steadily try to hatch them.
The unfortunate habit of egg-eating seems to be common
with the Rufous-tailed Grassfinch : Miss Hodgson has mentioned
it on page 58 of Vol. IV., and Mr. Savage, of Rouen, has
informed the writer that it has been noticed by aviculturists on
his side of the Channel. If it were not for this habit there

would seem to be little difficulty in inducing this species to breed
in our aviaries : it is almost always ready to nest, and it seems to
be as hardy as most of the small Australian finches, far hardier,
in fadt, than either Bicheno's or Gould's.
The cock of the pair above described met with an
untimely end last September (1898). A cock Yellow Sparrow
(Passer luteus) had for some months occupied the same aviary,
and had never appeared to be at all dangerous towards his
companions. One day a wife was obtained for him, and no
sooner was she put into the aviary than the pair commenced to
murder their companions. They were very soon captured and
caged, but not until the gallant little cock Rufous-tail and a
hen Crimson-finch (Neochmia phaeton) had been murdered.
A new mate was soon found for the widow, and the pair
now live very happily together. The new bird is a much finer
specimen than was his predecessor ; but his song is almost
inaudible, whereas that of the first male could be clearly heard
at a distance of ten or fifteen feet.
The song of Bathilda ruficauda , which is very frequently
uttered, closely resembles that of Gould's Grassfinch, and seems
to prove that Dr. Sharpe has correctly placed this species next
to the more typical Grassfinches, although in many respects it
somewhat resembles the Waxbills.
The present writer's observations of Bathilda ruficauda
have led to the opinion that it may safely be kept with the
smallest and most helpless of birds, providing the aviary is not
very small. It will, it is true, when nesting, make headlong
dashes at any bird that may chance to approach its nest too
closely, but it will do 110 actual harm, and when not nesting is
perfectly peaceable. It must, however, be remembered that this
opinion is based upon a somewhat limited experience of three
examples only, and other specimens may be found to differ
somewhat in temperament.
The Rufous-tailed Grassfinch has been bred in France
and possibly in England, although no account of the rearing of
the young has as yet been published. As to food, canary- and
millet-seed form its staple diet in captivity ; chickweed and
flowering grass should also be given when obtainable. The
specimens above described have occasionally been seen to
tackle a mealworm, but animal food does not appear to be
necessary, except, perhaps, when there are young to be reared,
when probably egg-food of some kind and soaked ants'-eggs
would be beneficial.

The following is a description of the adult male--Above,
olive-brown gradually shading into olive-yellow on the under
parts ; the throat, breast, and flanks are covered with white spots
which become smaller as they approach the chin ; face, bright
crimson with minute white spots on the sides and chin ; upper
tail-coverts, rosy-pink with large whitish spots ; tail-feathers,
dull red ; bill, bright red ; iris, orange ; feet, yellow.
The female is like the male, but much duller in colour,
with scarcely any red on the face.
The young are said to be of an uniform buffy brown, the
eye yellowish olive, surrounded by a narrow line of olive ; bill
reddish browm.
THE INDIAN ROLLER.
Coracias indicus.
By Reginald Philupps.
In June, 1898, when in a bird-shop, my attention was
attracted by a Roller. I11 the dull light, and from its general
shape and carriage, notwithstanding its rather smaller and more
feminine bill, it seemed to be a specimen of our common species ;
but on a closer inspection I found a very different bird, none
other than the Indian Roller. Presumably it was an 1897 bird
in the middle of its "spring" moult, which perhaps had been
retarded or unduly prolonged by its cage life and recent travels.
The body was partly featherless; but the small feathers quickly
grew, and in this respedt the plumage became perfect. Not so,
unhappily, with the flights and tail feathers ; these had been
grown and ground to powder before I received it, and very few
have been reproduced up to date.
Owing, probably, to careless treatment, I have found this
individual specimen exceptionally timid and nervous. But the
considerate and tender care that has since been bestowed upon
it has not been without its influence for good ; and it has so far
recovered its composure that when in difficulties I can, with
patience, induce it to come on to the back of my open hand,
and remain there sufficiently long to enable me to carry it to its
house : it has in it the making of a nice bird.
My male European Roller has been very hard upon his
Indian cousin, and attacks it pretty savagely sometimes, so the
latter keeps a great deal in its house, in which it is always shut
up at night and at meal-times.

When I approach, this bird invariably faces me, and I
rarely see its back ; moreover it is in the shade of its house ; so
the following particulars must be received only as a rough
indication of the plumage.
This Indian Roller has the appearance of being slimmer
and slightly smaller than my female European, and distinctly
less bulky than the male. The bill and claws seem to be black,
but probably are very dark brown ; all round the base of the bill,
sandy, the ej^e-ring and the bare triangular spot behind the eye
being much of the same colour. A large cap of light blue-green
on the crown, and a line of the same over the eye. Sides of face,
fore neck, chest and breast lilac- or purple-brown ; but round the
neck, broadening out on the chest and tinging the cheeks, there
is a strong wash of purple-lilac ; and the bird is further orna-
mented in the front by light-coloured shaft-streaks, radiating
from the throat sideways and downwards, the whole having a
a very beautiful effect. Thighs, abdomen, under and upper tail
coverts, and about two inches--above and below--of all the tail
feathers but the two central, light blue. Basal ends of tail
feathers (excepting the two central) and a narrow band at the
tips, beautiful deep blue. I fancy the colours of the primaries,
or of a good many of the flights, are the same, and arranged
more or less on the same plan. Mantle and back generally, and
the two central feathers of the tail, light olive brown. The front
parts of the closed wing seem to be light blue or blue green, and
on the shoulder there is some brilliant purplish blue. Regs and
toes (not claws) whity-browu. The eye seems to be dark brown,
but perhaps it is not quite so dark as it appears.
The notes of the bird, so far as I am acquainted with
them, bear a family likeness to those of C. garndus, but are
shorter, sometimes almost forming a bark, and less musical.
Ill-natured people would, I fear, speak of them as harsh.
It swings its tail up and down like the European bird,
only more so, probably through nervousness.
I have never seen this bird drink, nor any signs of the
water, always in its house, ever having been touched. During a
mild shower in the summer, it occasionally managed to get into
the garden and have a shower-bath, on the highest possible
perch if allowed to remain there by the other birds ; but its
craving for a sun-bath was invariably acute.
Neither have I seen it touch sop, nor yet fruit--dried or
otherwise--but it seems to take a little of the former. When

first received it ate a good deal of dry crumbled biscuit, but takes
very little of it now.
The bird has never ailed since it has been with me, and,
considering that it is not fully clothed and cannot take much
exercise, is perhaps not more susceptible to cold than the
European Roller. They all revel in the sun, and dislike our
dull cheerless November weather.
I cannot make up my mind as to the sex ; but the face
and bill seem feminine.
Doubtless the food in its wild state is practically the same
as that of the European Roller.
I should suppose that a good specimen of the Indian
Roller in its native sun would be a glorious creature.

By O. E. Cressweee.
There may be some of our members to whom a few notes
may be of interest on some rare Pigeons and Doves, which I
have added to my collection during the past year ; and also upon
the breeding of one or two other species which are not rare.
In the month of April, I received from a kind corres-
pondent in the West Indies some large crates, containing about
thirty inmates of the genus Columba. They travelled from the
Eondon docks through a bitterly cold night, and arrived on a
bitterly cold morning. I was from home, and my headman in
the aviaries found, with consternation, some lovely little Turtles
almost dead. They looked beyond power of feeding; but his
promptitude saved them all : in the warmth of a kitchen
they came round, and turned their attention to white millet ;
but I will presently go into fuller particulars about them. The
consignment as a whole was of interest from two points of
view--firstly, that, as far as I can discover, three of the species
have very rarely been imported ; secondly, because some of the
less rare species had been hand-reared from the nest, and are,
therefore, absolutely tame. The great drawback to the race is
its extreme timidity : consequently one specially appreciates
tame Doves. I will take them in order.
First, were six large and curious Wood Pigeons --
" Ramyers " they are called in Barbados--I presume a variation

<bodyText confidence="0.999401465116279" page_id="32638436"  page_num="Page 67" year="" vol="">
of the French " Ramiers." On their arrival (for I had never
seen their like) I referred to my favourite but ponderous tome,
Temminck's "Res Pigeons," splendidly illustrated by Madame
Knip. It is, as far as my knowledge goes, by far the finest,
though not always absolutely correct, work on its subject.
There, under the name Pigeon a nuque ecaillee, I at once found a
perfect picture of the species. In the Catalogue of the British
Museum ( Columbce , p. 280) it is described as Columba sqiiamosa ;
elsewhere as Columba corensis and Columba portoricensis. It is a
large Pigeon about 14 inches long, with a flat and rather snake-
like head. Its general colour is dull and plumbeous, but this is
relieved by a lovely cape at the back of the neck, each feather of
which is crossed by bands of rich metallic violet and velvety
black ; the eye-ceres are yellowish red, and the beak red shading
into yellow towards the tip.
I had the misfortune soon to lose three out of the six ;
one arrived with and died of a bronchial affection, the two
handsomest cocks succumbed to the common ill of closely-caged
birds, excessive fat. The long cold late spring was very
embarrassing; were the time to come over again, I should put
them all into an outdoor aviary the first sunny day, but I waited
for real warmth and, meanwhile, lost these three. The survivors
seem perfectly healthy out of doors, and I hope may this year
enjoy life and possibly breed in a large enclosure which is
slowly approaching completion, and is destined to be a
"paradise" for many birds.
Second.--The next was a single specimen, not rare and at
first sight not beautiful, but in the hand its vinous tints and
delicate pencillings were really so--a Picazuro Pigeon, Columba
picazuro of the Museum Catalogue. She had come in a ship to
Barbados, probably the pet of sailors, where my friend bought
her for me. With him, she paired with a Ramyer. With me,
she took no notice of any other bird ; she was the tamest and
most gentle creature possible, lavished all her affection on
human beings, and delighted to nestle her head in my hand.
She could not fly. For some weeks I put her in a large cage,
and then put her out in a summer aviary, where my Zebra and
Diamond Doves and such small fry nest. She molested nothing,
and spent her time in a quiet way, till one hot morning we found
her dead--another vidtim of much food and little exercise.
Third.--The next lot--an extremely rare and valuable
importation of six, about a third larger than Barbary Turtles--
were procured from Tobago. The first thing which struck me

68
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99427088372093" page_id="32638437"  page_num="Page 68" year="" vol="">
in them was a brilliant sky-blue cere round the eyes. Their
plumage reminded me of the pictures of Columba rufaxilla, in
the old "Naturalists' library ; " but neither there nor in any
description in the Museum Catalogue, of that or of cognate
species of Leptoptila, could I find any notice of their striking
eyes. The fact is that cabinet naturalists are seldom acquainted
with any but dead specimens, hence many omissions and many
errors of description, especially of eyes and beaks which change
colour in death : a proof, if such were wanting, of the use of
scientific aviculture. After some months, one of these Doves
died, and I soon saw that the beauty of the eye cere did not
survive. The authorities of the Museum have pronounced the
species to be Leptoptila wellsi from Grenada. I think I may
accurately call them very rare, for the Museum seems to possess
but one skin. Their tints are soft and pretty--back olive-brown,
the back of the neck having a purple sheen, under parts white
shading into pink. I have not found them interesting ; after
nine months they are still shy, hardly ever utter a sound, and
take no notice of each other. I think I made a mistake in not
putting them out last summer. This large arrival had over-taxed
my accommodation : I was afraid of over-crowding the outdoor
aviaries, and so have kept them continuously in a bird-room.
Fourth.--Next came about four pairs of Zenaida aurita.
I have before received this species, and described them in
" Notes on my Doves in 1S97." I will not repeat myself, but I
may add one or two particulars, as my former notes were written
a few months after the arrival of my first consignment.
(a). Those received in June, 1897, bore last winter with
apparent comfort in a by 110 means sheltered outdoor aviary,
where all still survive.
(\0x0440) . The cocks are terribly quarrelsome. Pairs frequently
nest, and eggs are laid, but hatching is out of the question, such
are their squabbles.
(\0x0441) . They are decidedly tameable. Two of the last lot
(fortunately a cock and a hen) are absolutely tame. I have them
in a cage, and the cock comes to the open door to be petted.
Fifth.--Fast in order, because least in size, but by no
means so in interest or rarity, are the tiny Turtles of Barbados,
Chamoepelia passerina of the British Museum Catalogue. They
are truly exquisite and delicate little birds. Madame Knip's
illustrations of them in Temminck's " Pigeons" hardly do justice
to their elegant form and dainty gait. They are barely six
inches long, and run and fly with astounding rapidity. The

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999501348837209" page_id="32638438"  page_num="Page 69" year="" vol="">
general effedt of their plumage is a delicate pencilling of silver
greys, suffused on the breast with tints of madder. They are
terribly difficult to import, from their extreme timidity ; hence
the fact that, though they are found, with many local variations,
over great tracts of S. America, in Mexico, the West Indian
Islands, and even in California, they are hardly ever offered fox-
sale in Kurope. My friend in Barbados learnt that over and over
again cages of them had been shipped for England, but that
none ever arrived alive. They absolutely batter themselves to
pieces. Some which he procured for me did so before they
could be shipped. However, he made the attempt, dispatched
ten in a very snug box, and five reached me. I have already
alluded to the state of collapse in which they arrived, owing, I
think, to their being supplied with big gi&apos;ain and no small seed.
For many months I left them in a hot kitchen, then for a while
in an outdoor room, and from August until lately in a very warm
outdoor aviary, not artificially heated but partially glazed and
catching every ray of sun. The moult has been a difficulty :
two succumbed to it, but one pair are in fine plumage and
condition, and show signs of pairing.
Sixth.--Eastly a single Necklace Dove (^Turtur chinensis),
which doubtless had arrived in some ship from the East Indies,
accompanied this party from the West ; very acceptable he was,
for I had hens but no pure cock of the l&apos;ace. I have had maiy
beautiful hybrids from these liens, which have picked up sti&apos;ange
husbands, those by a Blue Senegal Dove being the handsomest.
I mated this cock with a hen which came from Manilla six years
ago, and they nested at once.
Reading Dr. Butler's article on the breeding of Necklace
Doves, in an early number of the Magazine of last year, I was
struck by his remark, " This species has been bred by at least
two aviculturists in Germany," implying, apparent^, that their
breeding is not very common. My own nest almost all the 3^ear
i-ound, more regularly than Barbaiy Turtles. I remember, too,
in early childhood seeing them nesting in the shrubberies of a
Middlesex garden. Their owner kept a few, which he called
"African Doves," among many Barbaiy Turtles, and in summer
left the aviary-doors open--all flew in and out and nested at
their own sweet will.
To pass from my new acquisitions to old favourites--At
last, in 1898, I reared one Bronze-nape ( Htimeralis ). Annually
the parents have hatched about five pairs, which they invariably
desert when about a fortnight old, after bestowing upon them

the most devoted care in their early days. This one I rescued
and transferred to a Barbary pair. Much the same is the fate ot
the young Zebras (Geopelia striata) : the parents nest incessantly,
and go to nest again too soon ; but during great heat one or two
are reared annual^ in spite of parental indifference. I think
this apparently unnatural behaviour of the old birds may easily
be accounted for. In a state of nature they are at once occupied
and fatigued in providing for their nestlings ; in captivity food
is always at hand, and the desire to breed again is induced
before the offspring can do without the warmth of the mother at
night.
I find Zebras wonderfully hardy for Indian birds ; I see
no sign of chilliness yet (Jan. 18) in some which I have still in
their cold summer aviary, whence they generally migrate in
November into winter quarters.

THE BLACKCAP AS AN AVIARY-BIRD.
By Septimus Perkins.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994517333333333" page_id="32638439"  page_num="Page 70" year="" vol="">
By common consent the Nightingale takes the first place
as a songster among our native birds, and I suppose few would
dispute the right of the Blackcap to the second place. The
Nightingale and the Blackcap, being thus recognised as our two
leading feathered vocalists, have become associated together in
the minds of most people, and this association is emphasized at
the large Bird Shows, where the species are almost always
classed together. There is, however, but little in common
between the two birds--which are, by the way, placed in different
sub-families by most ornithologists.
I am not prepared to sa} r that, provided both birds be fed
with equal wisdom and care, the Blackcap will live longer in
captivity than the Nightingale--but that the Blackcap will live
and thrive on food upon which the Nightingale will speedily
sicken and die, is an undoubted fact. Therefore I think the
Blackcap may fairly be considered much the hardier bird.
Indeed, I will go further than that, and say that in my opinion
the Blackcap, of all the small insectivorous birds, is the easiest
to keep, while the Nightingale is--well, scarcely one of the most
difficult, but still a hard bird to keep in health.
To those who are taking up with soft-food birds I would
say, " Begin with a Blackcap." Give him a good-sized aviary,
plenty of baths, as much fruit as he will eat, sop made with
boiled milk (unsweetened), and some mixture of insectivorous

food containing ants'-eggs and a little, but not too much, egg.
The chief danger is that the bird should become too fat, there-
fore the food should not be so appetising as to induce him to
over-eat himself--and the more he confines himself to fruit and
sop the less danger there will be of fits. Give a few mealworms
now and then--but the Blackcap is not very keen on them, and
almost any other kind of live insedt is more wholesome.
I do not know why Dr. Bradburn made the astonishing
statement that the Blackcap is " a very much more delicate bird
than the Nightingale." This is not my experience, nor that of
other aviculturists with whom I have discussed the point. Dr.
Bradburn, however, appears to recommend that the bird should
be fed just like the Nightingale, that is, mainly on ants'-eggs.
Now, I have never found the Blackcap to be fond of ants'-eggs,
and can quite believe that on such a diet he would not live long.
The female is readily distinguished from the male by a
reddish brown colour of the head--in fact, it is not a " blackcap "
at all.
A hand-reared Blackcap makes a most charming pet, but
is generally less robust than wild-caught specimens (a).

Sir,--I have pleasure in giving the fullest particulars possible, but as
the bird is now " out of colour" I cannot make so complete a reply as I
could wish.
Our member Mr. Maxwell was the first owner of the bird, after the
dealer, and he bought it as a " Paradise Combasou," and entered it as such
at the February Show at the Palace, 1898, The bird's tail was lost in
catching him out of the aviary, so the entry was marked absent.
I am sorry that I have not a very distindt recollection of the bird's
plumage when "in colour," but as my present collection numbers some
four hundred birds, and the bird in question is one of about a hundred
flying about in a very large aviary, I trust I may be excused.
Mr. Maxwell informs me that the bird has only two long tail-feathers
when in full plumage. To the .best of my recollection, the bird had, when
in condition, a reddish beak, and no white whatever in his plumage. Out
of colour, he is only to be distinguished from a Paradise Whydah in the
same condition by his red legs and smaller size.
In the hope that the exhibit may be of interest to our members, I
have entered the bird for the forthcoming Palace Show, and after the Show
(a). I quite agree with all that Mr. Perkins has written respecting this bird. I
should say that there was no difficulty in keeping a Blackcap, and though I should
not give sop myself, I daresay it would answer if frequently changed.--A. G. B.

I will keep it under observation throughout its next change of colour and
development of tail. I have adopted the suggestion of Mr. Pbillipps and
Dr. Butler, and have entered the bird as a Resplendent Wliydah.
Henry J. Fueejames.
Sir,--I n reply to Mr. Pbillipps, I beg to say that my Dong-tailed
Couibasou had some white under the wings and was flecked with white on
the abdomen. It was only the central feathers of the tail that were long,
I had the bird about two years: half the year lie had a short tail and
mottled brown body, and when he came into black plumage he grew a long
tail. When I bought him he looked like an ordinary Combasou out of
colour, (bj

CRIMSON FINCHES, ETC.
Sir, --Having had a lot of Crimson Finches, Red-rumps, Dong-tailed
Grass-finches and Parrot-finches brought me last November, I can testify
to the quarrelsome disposition of the Crimson Finch.
One cock which I have now will clear the decks of all other birds, be
they ever so many and without regard to their size. When mine arrived, all the
hens were together, and I kept them so for a week ; then I paired them,
and out of five pairs only two pairs agreed -- all the others fought like mad ;
but one cock put in with other species settled down and sings away quite
contentedly.
Dong-tailed Grass-finches, when first imported, will agree for a while,
but soon they begin to choose their mates, and then a general scramble
begins -- pitched battles are the order of the day, till night comes on. They
are truly named Squatting Grass-finches, as they do a lot of squatting on
cage-bottoms.
W. Osbai.deston.
BREEDING EXPERIENCES.
Sir, -- Thinking that the experiences of a fellow-aviculturist may lie
interesting to some of your readers, I venture to give briefly some results
of the last breeding season.
To begin with, my Snowy Owls, a pair, brought from Norway in 1891,
went to nest last summer for the first time; five eggs were laid, and when
the female began to sit the male stood sentry during the whole period of
incubation, but was never seen to go on to the nest except to take food to
his mate. Two young were presently seen 111 the nest --a hole scratched in
the floor of the covered part of the aviary. Whether the other eggs were
broken, or whether young were hatched from them but became dried up
and unrecognisable by the time it became possible to clean out the refuse
round the nest, was never ascertained. Two young were, however, partly
reared, and though one went wrong and died, the other survived and is now
strong and vigorous. The parents, up to now (Jan. 21), have not molested
. (#) Thank you ; your bird was likewise a Resplendent Whydah.--R.P,

their offspring, but, of course, as the breeding season approaches, it will be
necessary to part them.
Of Waterfowl, the following species nested : Geese --Bean and White-
fronted, but the eggs of each proved clear. Ducks --three Eider Ducks laid
clutches of eggs, and three young Eider Ducklings were hatched under a
hen, of which two died when the size of a Teal, apparently overcome by
the sun one very hot day ; one, a female, survived aud is doing well.
Young of Mandarin, Carolina, Common Shelduck, Wigeon, Red-
crested Pochard, and Tufted-duck were successfully reared. Two clutches
of eggs, laid by a Carolina duck mated with a Mandarin drake, proved
unfertile, as has been the case on several other occasions. I have lately
heard of an instance, in a neighbouring county, where a hybrid between
these species was hatched and reared up to the first moult. Some half-a-
dozen years ago, one of my full-winged Mandarin ducks paired with a
full-winged Carolina drake, and nested in the hollow bough of a tall elm
tree; five young were hatched under a hen, and at the end of a fortnight
were thriving, but were all lost in one day through the unfortunate
neglect of the person in charge.
Wigeon, Pochards, Tufted-ducks, and Gadwalls are all established
here, breeding freely and, except in hard weather, supporting themselves--
the offspring of pinioned pairs turned down. The Gadwalls, unfortunately,
have a way of nesting in the covers away from the water, and the sitting
ducks get woefully thinned by foxes. This spring there was only one
Gadwall duck about, with several drakes, aud I could not find that there
was a nest.
My Whooper Swans made a nest, or rather the male did--a fine bird
which I obtained when in the grey plumage of the first year. The female
was a recent acquisition, and not in very good condition when the breeding
season commenced. It was very curious to see the male steal on to the nest
in the mornings, and most carefully go through the pantomime of covering
up the egg that the female was supposed to have laid--so at least we
interpreted his proceedings. As a matter of fact, the female never appeared
to feel any interest in the nest; but I hope to have better results this year.
My Pin-tailed Sandgrouse (two pairs) laid several clutches of their
beautiful eggs, but owing, I think, to the excessive looseness of the soil in
their aviary, the sand fell in on the eggs and filled up the scratches, which
are made rather deep, and the bird each time gave up incubating. (In 1897
we reared a fine young female of this species). A pair of Black-breasted
Sandgrouse laid three clutches of three eggs each, but each time the eggs
were cracked, the blame being laid at first upon a Rock Thrush, then upon
some Pratincoles, until the male Grouse was found to be the real
delinquent. As in this family the male bird takes his share of incubation,
in the case of the Pin-tailed species at any rate, regularly going on to
the nest for the night, it would be impossible to divide the birds after the
eggs were laid, and I am at a loss to know what plan to adopt in case the
same thing occurs this next season.
A pair of Cornish Choughs, which I have had for five or six years,
made their usual nest in a box, but though both birds seemed to take the
greatest interest in the proceedings, and the nest was well constructed of
birch twigs, and carefully lined with the hair of an old grey pony, no eggs
were laid. I am now allowing the birds to live pradtically at liberty in the

hope that the exercise, and the animal food which they are able to pick up
while at large, may lead to better results.
Of smaller birds, of which I have no great number, three young
Parrot-finches were reared, as I have already reported in the Magazine.
Six young Red-lieaded Gouldian Finches were hatched, but, owing to the
unaccountable death of their parents, perished. My disappointment was
to some extent lessened by the fact that, through this mishap, an interest-
ing account of the curious mouth-decoration of these callow nestlings was
communicated by Dr. Butler to the December number of the Magazine.
My female Rock Thrush very unluckily slipped out of the aviary-door,
just as she was at the point of going to nest ; and, being hunted away
by a pair of Starlings who had a nest close by, I never was able to recover
her.
Several young were hatched, and two or three reared, of the rare
Columba laurivora, from the Canary Islands. A pair of Diamond Doves also
nested, but several clutches of eggs were destined by a pair of Parson-
birds confined with them; and after I placed them in another aviary one
young one was partly reared, but, as often happens in confinement, the
parents went to nest again too soon, and the young one, not being able to
feed itself, perished, in spite of the charitable attentions of a cock
Painted Quail--who, although he could not feed it, was seen to brood the
young Dove on the floor of the aviary, when it was deserted by the old
ones. W. H. St. Quintin.
A WEASEL IN THE AVIARY.
Sir, --One morning in the last week of November I noticed some Quaii
feathers on the ground of the aviary. One of my Quails was missing, and
appearances indicated that it had been killed and dragged into an artificial
burrow originally constructed for Shelduck. Here &quot;was an enigma. The
wire netting is three-quarter-inch, with half-inch round the bottom ; and I
could not find any hole in the ground through which an enemy could have
intruded. No rat could have obtained an entrance, and I could only
conclude that a weasel had climbed up the wire and squeezed through the
three-quarter netting. Being satisfied as to the nature of the culprit, and
also as to his whereabouts, I arranged for his capture. The first thing to
do was to clear out and square the mouth of the hole, and set a Brailsford
trap before it in such a manner that the little wretch could not easily leave
the hole without passing through the trap. A strong tool was then worked
down to the wooden roof of the burrow, and bumped on it for a short time.
Although the inmate must have been thoroughly frightened he remained
indoors. I then went away, and within lialf-an-hour found a very small
weasel in the trap--he quickly met death by drowning. Needless to say
I was well satisfied to have escaped with the loss of a single bird. The
moral is, when building an aviary with wire netting do not use a larger
mesh than half-inch.

THE WILD CANARY.
Sir, --I have lately bought a bird from a dealer described as a Wild
Canary from the Canary Islands. It is very like an ordinary Green Canary
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.978510962962963" page_id="32638444"  page_num="Page 75" year="" vol="">
in colour and shape, but has not the same call-note as the domesticated
Canary. It is also not a Citral- nor a Serin-finch. Is there any other finch
in the Canary Islands very like a Wild Canary ?
C. Harrison.
The following reply was sent to Mr. Harrison :--
Your bird must be a Wild Canary if it came from the Canary Islands;
as, unless Serinus icterus has been introduced into the islands, it is the only
Serin found there, and you would be certain to recognize the Green
Singing-finch. The Wild Canary is smaller than the domesticated bird,
with the exception of the smaller Hartz-mountain Rollers.
A. G. Butler.
A FEATHER-EATING PARROT.
Sir, -- I should be glad to know if anyone has had to deal with a case
of feather -eating in Parrots. I have known plenty of cases of picking and
nibbling, but never a case in which the feathers were eaten before.
It has happened with a hen Nymphicus uvceensis, and was begun in the
aviary. The bird was so ragged in September, that I thought the weather
out of doors was perhaps too cold for the reproduction of its feathers, and
brought it in. But it has taken some time to find out the cause. I have
never seen the bird at it, but at last, finding wing- and tail-feathers dis-
appearing, I asked if any feathers were found on the bottom of the cage ?
On being assured there were none, there could be no longer any doubt that
the bird was eating them. I don't know whether anyone can suggest a
cure. The bird has plenty of wood to destroy. I am trying sulphur in its
sop, but I think I shall spray with quassia solution instead of giving the
bird its bath.

Sir, --I am afraid I cannot give any very satisfactory reply to Miss
Ashford's enquiry regarding the Avadavat which I bred. The bird proved
to be a hen : and as I had two other hens at the time, and have since lost
two from egg-binding, I cannot sa}^ whether the survivor is my young bird
or not, though I am inclined to think that it is. With regard to the time
of attaining adult plumage : it had not done so completely within three
months (though Dr. Russ says that the beak should be red in about eight
weeks), but unfortunately I made no very exact notes on this point at the
time.
Though my experience of the Crimson Finch agrees, to a large
extent, with that of Mr. Farrar, I should hesitate to count on the amiability
of this species against the general opinion of aviculturists. Certainly my
bird has never done more than slightly spar at times with his associates
(which are all rather larger than himself), but he will not endure the
presence of a female of his own kind. I have ceased to attempt to provide
him with a wife.
I have had a Madagascar Weaver, for about three years, in an aviary
with many other Weavers, including several species of his own size, and I

have never seen him molest them. For two years there was a Comoro
Weaver in the aviary, and these two quarrelled constantly in a nagging sort
of way; last autumn, however, matters came to a crisis and the Comoro
was killed.
I can entirely confirm what Mr. Fillmer says regarding the Pintail
Nonpareil. Rather more than two years ago I bought six individuals; of
these five died within two months, in spite of paddy rice, but the survivor
I have still in perfect health, and he has never given me a moment's
anxiety ; he appears to subsist mainly on Canary seed. Undoubtedly these
birds require very careful treatment when they first arrive, and should,
perhaps, be kept rather warm, but when once acclimatised they seem to be
hardy enough.
I should like to know what is the general experience as to the
hardiness of the Indigo Finch : I mean as to whether it will endure the
winter in an open-air aviary in this country ? In its native country it
appears always to migrate to a warmer climate in the winter, but I have
never observed the bird to show any desire to migrate here. My own
experience is that it will do well enough if deprived of all green food
during the cold season ; in an aviary with a small grass lawn I have twice
lost it from scouring in the winter, but in another which has nothing but
gravel it survived. Another cause of delicacy is, perhaps, the very early
season at which the bird assumes its summer plumage, mine is already
coming into colour; during this change it must naturally be susceptible to
inclement weather. On the whole it is, perhaps, safest under cover in the
winter. I find the Nonpareil far hardier and, by the way, far more inclined
to breed, though for some reason or other mine never get to the point of
hatching their eggs.
I had great hopes of young Diuca Finches this year; but my pair
were in a rather crowded aviary, and one morning I found the eggs thrown
out and broken, with almost fully-formed 5 r ouug birds inside. The Diuca
is very fond of cold potato, it is the first thing that they pick out of the
saucer of soft food every morning; thej 7 do not seem to care for fruit.
The question of providing fruit for Tauagers in the winter is rather a
serious one, if it be considered that only tropical fruits are suitable ; I find,
however, that apples serve the purpose perfedtly well, all my Tanagers take
to them readil} 7 . On the whole, however, I doubt the necessity of fruit; I
have kept my birds (Scarlet, Superb, Sayaca and Black Tanagers) for
months together without fruit of any kind and never noticed them to be in
the slightest degree the worse for it, but they always have potato in their
food-mixture. R. A. Todd.

Sir, --In the December number you gave your experience of your
birds' non-appreciation of dried flies when mixed with other food, and their
refusal of it when given by itself.
Some time ago one of our members wrote about dried flies, and I
wrote him for the address of the vendor ; on his reply I wrote for some.
The bag was put in a corner of the dining-room, and I had forgotten about
it, when there arose a most dreadful smell of stale fish. Until the little
Blenheim Spaniel had scented "game " and scratched the bag over, I could
not make out where the smell came from. It proved to be the dried flies.
Can they be collected from fish in a state of decomposition ? (cj .
Only keeping Waxbills and small Finches, I have given the flies
in a dry state. On my leaving home for three weeks, a couple of seed-
glasses were filled, and on my return they were empty. Whether the flies
had been eaten, or partly eaten and wasted, like birds will do at times in
throwing out their seed, I can't say. To those who have an outdoor aviary,
where the smell would not be so objectionable, they could be added for
change of diet, but for cage-birds the smell would alwaj's be a drawback.
As a substitute for insects, when they are unattainable, in my opinion
there is no food to equal Abrahams' preserved yolk of egg, which I have
used for twenty years ; but when he first sent it out it was labelled
" Hofmeier's."

MADAGASCAR WEAVER.
Sir,-- Your foot-note to my letter on the Madagascar Weaver in the
January number raises a question on which I should be glad to have the
experience of other members. I mentioned that the one I have had now
close upon two years killed another which was out of health, this consti-
tuting it, in your opinion, a dangerous companion for other birds. I am
afraid I conveyed a wrong impression in using the word " killed," I should
have been more precise in saying "harried it to death." It must be
remembered that the two birds were at the time in a cage only 30 x 16 ins.
One was the perfection of health, the second a newly-bought one which
turned out to be only in feeble health, otherwise it might have withstood
the persecution of its companion.
But the question I . wish to ask is--Is it not a common experience
that birds, especially males, are often unkind to, and intolerant of, ailing
members of their own species ? During my first six months of bird-
keeping, I had all my birds in a large cage in a living-room and, of course
watched them intently every day, and our attention was soon directed to
the heartless treatment accorded by a strong healthy Common Weaver to his
ailing little spouse, which he would not allow to nestle on a perch for long
without giving it an ill-natured peck. Some of us positively wept when
our first bird-vidlim succumbed like a little martyr. Alas, a cold heap of
feathers is now tossed into the garden with scarcely a sigh. Later on, we
( c) The insects have nothing- whatever to do with fish ; their similar life seems
to give them a similar smell, which undoubtedly is extremely unpleasant.--A.G.B.
Is not the smell caused by the small fish to be found in considerable numbers mixed
with the dried flies ?-- E)d.

observed the same intolerant behaviour amongst the Nuns towards a
Bronzewing that went blind on one side, from a warty growth, and which I
drowned out of compassion.
Standing one day by one of the immense outdoor aviaries in the
Antwerp Zoo, containing between three and four hundred Cardinals, I saw
a crested cock flop on to the floor evidently in a dying condition ; and as it
lay panting and gasping, a lot of the other robust villains felt it incumbent
upon them to call and give it a cuff and a kick, metaphorically speaking.
I could multiply examples, but will not occupy unnecessary space.
My Madagascar is living peaceably in a cage with smaller Weavers
not of its own species, and I would trust it with Waxbills in the extended
space of an aviary.

Sir, --Are Orange Weavers liable to be scarlet, and are there any two
dealers, excepting one or two well-known experts, who call the same
Weaver by the same name except the comprehensive one of Bishop ?
I sent to a Northern dealer for a Crimson Bishop, which, from
information kindly supplied by Mr. Fillmer, I hoped would be the Crimson-
crowned Weaver. When it arrived it had a jet-black head and abdomen,
with a brilliant scarlet chest and throat, the red feathers extending round
the back of neck like a ruffle ; wing-coverts a brownish red. Size, nearly as
big as a Madagascar.
Previously, I sent to a Southern dealer for an Orange Bishop, which
proved to be exactly similar, except that it was much smaller and the
scarlet feathers replaced by bright orange. It is very quiet, while the
red one is extremely vivacious.
I wrote the Northern dealer, telling him he must have sent a Grena-
dier Bishop ; to which he replied that he had sent me " an Orange Bishop,
sometimes called a Crimson; " that the " Grenadier Weaver was yellow and
black, also called the Napoleon Bishop " ! !

Sir, --With reference to an advertisement of wild Canaries,. I wrote
to the advertiser, and in reply he says they are some which he bought from
Cross and which were said to have been imported from South America. I
don't suppose the true wild Canary is found in South America, but I
thought possibly the birds might have been taken there from the Canary
Islands and then shipped to England.
The advertiser describes them as follows : " The cocks are dark green
on the back with still darker markings, the breast is a greenish yellow
getting to a deeper yellow under the throat, also a streak of yellow from
the beak to the ey 7 e. Their call-note is more like that of a Siskin, but in
build they are like the ordinary Green Canary and, of course, smaller."
Will you kindly let me know whether the above description points to
the birds being some finch known to belong to South America, or to their
being true wild Canaries.
C. Harrison.
The following reply was sent to Mr. Harrison :
The wild Canary of South America is the Saffron-finch (Sycalis
flaveola) ; but your birds are, I have no doubt, Sycalis arvensis. In
the description of the latter species in the British Museum Catalogue,
we read,--'' lores and feathers below the eye pale yellow, surmounted by a
streak of bright golden yellow " : this answers to what you describe as--" a
streak of yellow from the beak to the eye." Dr. Sharpe's description of
the back differs a little from yours, but he says,--"All the males in the
British Museum appear to be in seasonal or winter plumage, or else the ashy&apos;
shade which pervades the general aspect of the bird is an additional
specific cliaradter." According to him the base of the forehead is yellow,
the remainder of the crown and nape ashy-olive-yellow streaked with
blackish ; remainder of upper parts olive-yellowish-browu shading into
ashy^-olive-greenisli on the lower back and rump; the feathers broadly
streaked with blackish : his description of the under parts answers tolerably
well to yours, only 7 he says the abdomen is rather brighter yellow than the
throat (or possibly he may mean than the breast, which he describes as
ashy).
Putting a liberal construftion on the two descriptions, Dr. Sharpe's
differs from yours chiefly in the fact that he notes a sub-tint of brown in
the colouring of the mantle.

The Society for the Protection of Birds has under consideration the
advisability of initiating a movement having for its object the placing of
greater restrictions upon bird catching. Adding under instructions from
the Executive Committee of our Society, I have informed the Hon. Sec. of
the Society for the Protection of Birds that we should be pleased to co-
operate with her Society in the matter, and I find that they would be glad
if we could formulate some scheme. Suggestions from members are,
therefore, invited.
It is desirable that, in the event of there being legislation upon the
subject, it should take such a form as will not unduly hamper the capture
and sale, under suitable conditions, of such birds as are adapted for
captivity; while at the same time ensuring that the birds captured shall be
kept under conditions more in accordance with humanity than those which
exist at present. It is obvious that respectable bird-dealers have nothing
to fear from such a movement--in fact their position and profits would
probably be improved by registration.

CONFINEMENT.
By E. G. B. Meade-Waldo.
There is an exceedingly interesting paper in the January
number of the Ibis, by Mr. J. H. Gurney, on this subject, which
seems to me to be one that might be advanced by members of the
Avicultural Society. Authentic ages of the smaller passerine birds
would be of great value. Many large birds attain to great ages,
notabty the Eagles, their kin, and the Owls ; while many water-
fowl, Geese, Pelicans, and Ducks seem to live nearly as long.
The Parrots are credited with living a very long time, and, as
they are very largely kept, many great ages might be recorded:
80, 64, and 54 seem, however, to be the greatest ages that careful
research could produce.
The question naturally arises--Do birds in confinement
live longer than in a wild state? It is, of course, impossible to
answer this, but I should be inclined to think that, under
favourable conditions of food and surroundings, they would.
For, as birds get old, they are beaten by the vigorous younger
members of their species in the competition for mates ; and this
does not, as a rule, occur in confinement; where it can occur, I
have often seen that the older birds have to " go under." Many
solitary birds, those that have no opportunity of ever nesting,
are, undoubtedly, among the longest lived : while birds that breed
regularly do not, as a rule, live so very long. (I do not include
among these the birds of prey). The oldest authentic breeding
pair of small passerine birds with which I am acquainted, are a
pair of Trumpeter Bullfinches (A. githaginea) which I have at
present. I caught them myself, on Feb. 24th, 1888, in the Island
of Fuertaventura. The pair in question were then particularly
brilliant in colouring, perfectly different from anything ever
seen in confinement or in a skin--for the beautiful rose

colour fades almost at once. They were, therefore, probably
an old pair, but could not have been less than one year old.
They bred, at intervals, in both Mr. St. Ouintin's aviary and
in mine until 1897, when they must have been ten years old;
then they suddenly took it into their heads to go ahead
in a most amazing manner. They had four nests and reared
no less than twenty-two young ones, hatching every egg and
rearing each young--this latter operation being rendered much
easier for the parents, by the young of each nest going up
and feeding their y^ounger brethren, while in the nest and after
they had left. I saw the young do it while still being fed them-
selves by the parents ! This last summer the old pair only had
one nest and reared three y r oung ones, and lost an albino which
was drowned in a thunder-shower after it left the nest. I
distinctly see what I consider to be signs of age in the old hen :
she did not moult out so cleanly as she ought to do, and she
looks dull.
Another old bird here, is a female Canarian Laurel Pigeon,
Columba laurivora , which I took from the nest in 1888, in the
Island of Gomera. She has laid a great number of eggs, and
reared a number of young ones for two years, while she had a
husband to her taste. Since she lost him she will have nothing
to say to any of her sons. She lives at perfect liberty with some
others of her own species, but still keeps absolutely tame. It is
most amusing to see her stand up to a male Great Bustard, and
flick at his head when he is eating.
Pigeons, however, live to great ages, no doubt: 28J- years
is recorded in Mr. Gurney's list, and I have a cock Nicobar
Pigeon that was very old when I first got him -- eleven years ago.
He is in most perfect vigour still, as anyone may see in the
Western Aviary&apos;- in the Zoological Gardens where he is temporarily
deposited.
This question of the ages of birds seems so interesting
that I hope members of the Society may^ be induced to record
anyr that seem to them sufficiently important, and not to forget
to mention the conditions and feeding of the individuals under
notice.

The next class of Amazons (z. e., the medium sized)
contains some of the best talkers, not only amongst Amazons,
but amongst Parrots.
The largest of them--one almost large enough to go into
the first class--is the Golden-naped Amazon, Chrysotis auro-
pctlliata. This bird is certainly larger than Devaillant's. Its
size, according to the British Museum Catalogue, is 14 inches
total length, wing 9 inches, tail 4.7 inches ; as against 15 inches
total length for C. farinosa, 16 inches for C. bouqtieti, 19 inches
for C. augusta , and 17 inches for C. guildingi. Its colour is
green, but the head, upper tail-coverts, and under parts are much
lighter. Its distinctive marks--by which one can always know
it--are the black hairy feathers round the nostrils. These are
seen in the young, whereas the golden nape is not only missing in
the young, but sometimes never appears at all. Whether this has
anything to do with sex I do not know, but I certainly think
that a very pronounced yellow nape bespeaks a cock bird. The
bird is a quick learner if it be taken young, but I cannot say that
I believe in Amazons caught old learning to talk. I have only
once seen a Grey Parrot which never said a word, but I have
seen several Golden-napes and Double-fronts which never did.
But get a young Golden-nape, and I incline to think you will
find it quite as clever as the Double-fronted.
But they differ in powers of learning. They are not very
common, and particularly not the young ones, so that I have not
had experience of more than three or four. One I bought,
ready taught, from France : it said the usual French sentences
and was sold as singing a song, but that it did not do. I do not
think it learnt anything fresh when with me, but I am not able
to give much time to the birds, so that is not much proof that it
would not learn. Then I bought two at Jamrach's some three
years ago. There were some seven young ones, and I picked
out two, which I looked on as cock and hen. Whether they
were so or not, I do not know ; but the one I set down as the
cock learnt much more quickly than the other, and as all my
experience goes to show that as a rule sex does make a great
difference in a bird's talking powers, I believe that I had picked
-out a cock and hen. But my best talker came to an untimely

end : I let them both out, and after two or three days they came
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998107372093023" page_id="32638453"  page_num="Page 84" year="" vol="">
back to the garden. I had to be away all day, and when I came
back at evening, only the hen, which was the shyest, was to be
seen. I caught her and never heard any more of the other, but
I have reason to suppose it fell a victim to a stone-throwing boy.
But, like all Amazons, these birds, though not screamers, are
noisy. Still, I conclude by saying that if anyone wants a
talking Parrot, they will not go far wrong if they can buy a
young Golden-nape.
The Double-fronted Amazon, as dealers call Chrysotis
levaillanti, needs no one to sing its praises. It is universally
allowed to be one of the best talkers amongst Parrots. It hardly
needs description : it is about the size of a Pigeon, and is easily
distinguished by its white beak and white feet. Still, there is
another Amazon, Chrysotis ochroptera , which has a white beak
and white feet, and the yellow head of the Double-fronted. But
the two may easily be known apart : first, by the smaller size
of C. ochr&apos;optera ; secondly, by its yellow shoulder-butts ; and
thirdly, by its having its feathers edged with black.
There is almost as great a difference between the plumage
of different specimens of C. levaillanti , as between different
specimens of the common Blue-fronted. Variegated, or "King"
birds, as the dealers call them, are not so common ; but some
have very little yellow on their heads, and some have the whole
head yellow. Those that I have seen of this latter sort were
morose birds and non-talkers. I suspect they were of great age
and had been caught old. I would warn everyone against buying
an old bird if they want a talker; I am persuaded that they never
learn when caught old. But get a young bird and there is nothing
you may not teach it. The best Parrot I ever had, or probably
ever shall have, was a Double-fronted I picked up at Brest. It
sang seven songs, did the French military exercises, said other
things and swore like a sailor, and did it all when I told it.
There was, however, one peculiarity about it, and that was it
never learnt anything fresh. I had it only about a year and then
it died, poor thing ! of cancer on the brain, but it never learnt a
word of English. It was not at all noisy, and admirably good-
tempered. I had to hold it during a painful operation, but it
bore me no malice. But though a bird like that is one in a
million, I would still say--If you want to start a Parrot, and
teach it yourself, write to a dealer and tell him to be on the
look-out for a young one for you, and get it with as yellow a cap
as you can. I cannot too often repeat that sex makes all the
difference in talking in every race of Parrots except the Greys,

<bodyText confidence="0.999222380952381" page_id="32638454"  page_num="Page 85" year="" vol="">
and even in those the exceptional talkers are probably cocks.
Of course you must know how to distinguish a young bird,
unless you know a dealer whom you can trust.
Amazons, however, have their drawbacks over and above
their noisiness, of which they are more easily broken than
Greys are of screaming--they are much more jealous, and more
uncertain. Greys are sometimes jealous, and I have had cock
birds that were quite good-tempered till another was put with
them, and then would bite ; but Amazons can never be trusted
when another Parrot is by, whether the other Parrot be an
Amazon or not. And an Amazon may bite you when you see
no reason at all for it. " Pomeranian dogs," say some, " are
uncertain." "No," I always reply, " not all. They are certain
to bite 3^ou, or certain to leave you alone." But that is not the
case with an Amazon. He ma}^ be sitting on your hand in a
perfectly good temper, apparently, and suddenly give you a good
bite. I do not think the hens are subject to jealousy, so that if
a bird shows jealousy you may hope you have a cock bird.
In concluding this article, I may say that as I recognise
the difficulty to a beginner in knowing how to distinguish a
young bird, or how to set about getting the Parrot he wants, I
am quite ready to help any member of our Society with advice,
if he likes to write to me.
TOUCANS.
By W. OSBALDESTON.
These birds, up to within the last few j^ears, have been
rarely seen by the average aviculturist. A few were to be found
at the Zoos, but except for their novelty they excited little
interest. Those which, from time to time, found their way to the
dealers' shops offered little inducement towards the cultivation
of a closer acquaintance, being generally in a rough and almost
naked condition, and fed upon dirty, sloppy food. But a good
many specimens have been imported of late years, and I have
had about ten different species--they have almost all arrived
with cut wings, which makes them look stunted, stupid and
far from pleasing.
When once moulted in a good sized cage or aviary, and fed
upon a suitable diet, they become very ornamental and desirable
birds. It is true they have no song, only a croak, but this
deficiency is made up for by their affedtion for their feeders and
caretakers, the gorgeous hues of their feathers, and the beautiful
transparent tints of their lobster-claw-like mandibles, which, by

the way, are more formidable in appearance than in reality.
They can, however, give you an ugly tear by getting hold with
the point of the bill and, by a dexterous movement, twisting the
flesh round---this will cause a wound like that front a severe
pinch, which is apt to fester.
Toucans are very clean birds, and are extremely fond of
water. They like a good syringe immensely, but care must be
taken that they do not get a chill while drying. Being very
sparsely feathered they will not stand severe cold--they lack the
down under the feathers possessed by many birds, notabty by the
Parrots--and 50* is the lowest temperature in which they should
be kept to insure their remaining in good condition ; although
mine have stood for months a temperature of only 40* in an
unheated aviary, but at such a low temperature they do not care
to bathe, or preen themselves if syringed, and therefore get
grim\ T -looking and rnopey.
I prefer the larger species, as they are, as a rule, more
brilliantly coloured and are more docile and attached to their
keepers.
I feed my Toucans on a mixture composed of yolk of egg,
ants' eggs, grocers' currants, various seeds ground down, mixed
together with pea meal, put into a warm oven with syrup. They
get to like this well, and it will keep any length of time. I add
beef dripping to this mixture as recpiired for use, and give it
to all my soft-bills. Occasionally I give the Toucans soaked
currants as a tit-bit--they like these and swallow them as if they
were pills. They are very fond of grapes---the larger Toucans
will swallow them whole like the currants, tossing them up with
the end of the bill and catching them in the open gape, when
they go down at one gulp. The smaller Toucans generally break
or cut them in two before finally disposing of them. They like
bananas cut up fine, also apples and pears. Mealworms they
will take from the hand--but I hardly think these are suitable
food for fruit-eating birds such as Toucans.
I consider Toucans pleasing, affectionate, and very
attractive birds--but above all things they must be kept clean.
Sawdust is the best thing for the bottom of the cage.
If the food and water be placed on the level of the perches
they do not often leave them to get on the bottom of the cage--
but they should be supplied with at least two perches, so that
they may hop from one to the other for exercise.
When asleep they look very peculiar, with the tail
perpendicular, the head and bill buried in the feathers on the
back, and the body scpiatted 011 the perch.

THE CRYSTAL PALACE SHOW OF 1899.
BRITISH BIRDS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997034" page_id="32638456"  page_num="Page 87" year="" vol="">
So far as numbers were concerned, the British Birds at
the recent Palace Show were well up to the mark, and the task
of judging can have been no easy one. There was, however,
nothing particularly rare, or of very special interest.
The Bullfinch class contained no less than seventy-four
entries : a truly grand array of crimson-breasts, but a most
difficult class to judge. The bird that received the first prize
was by far the largest British Bullfinch I have seen, if, indeed, it
was a genuine John Bull, which some sceptical visitors to the
Show were half inclined to doubt. The second prize winner was
a truly lovely specimen, and so, in fact, were many in this
class, in which seven prizes were given.
Excellent as were the Bullfinches, both in quality and
number, the Goldfinches were even better. No less than eighty-
two specimens were exhibited, and seven prizes were given.
Mr. Job Williams is the owner of the first-prize winner, and he
may be congratulated on possessing one of the most perfect
Goldfinches that is ever likely to grace the Show-bench. The
second in order of merit ran the first decidedly close, but there
could be no question as to which was the best bird of the two.
There was nothing to call for special remark about the
Chaffinches. The best bird was No. 1,488, belonging to Mr.
Mclnroy, which I believe received the first prize, although, by
some mistake, it was marked V. H. C. in the Catalogue.
Einnets formed a good class, numbering no less than
sixty-nine specimens. The first-prize winner, belonging to Mr.
H. D. Hart, was a beautifully-shaped bird.
There were twenty-four entries in the class for Lesser
Redpolls and Twites. A very nice Twite, belonging to Mr.
Lowne, received the first prize. Siskins numbered thirty-one
entries, amongst which were some very beautiful birds, many of
which were, however, colour-fed. Mr. Frostick's exhibit, which
received the first prize, was perhaps slightly the best bird,
although several others ran it remarkably close.
Next came the class for "Any other variety of Resident
Finch," which was chiefly composed of Hawfinches and Yellow-
hammers; there were, however, also a few other nice birds,
notably one or two Cirl-buntings, a Reed-bunting, and a Snow-
bunting, which can scarcely be called a resident. There were
also two or three Greenfinches, a Corn-bunting, and two House

Sparrows, one of which, a hen, was catalogued as a " Tree
Sparrow." The first prize went to a very neat Hawfinch
belonging to Mr. Lowne.
In the class for Larks and Pipits, Messrs. Kilbury Bros.'
Skylark received the first prize, for the sixth time at the Palace.
A very beautiful Shorelark, the property of Mr. Parker Robinson,
came second ; and a delightful Woodlark, belonging to Mr.
Frostick, third. There were also one or two nice Tree Pipits
and Meadow Pipits.
There were some charming birds amongst the Robins,
several of which sang beautifully during the Show. I liked No.
1,711 best, but it was overlooked entirely by the Judge.
Some splendid Blackbirds were shown; "Zulu Prince,"
the winner of the first prize, is as good a Blackbird as I remember
to have seen. Another very tame and charming specimen (No.
1,736) was shown by Mr. B. H. Wilson, but it should have been
in a cage painted white, instead of dark green, inside.
There were thirty-three Song-thrushes, many of which
sang beautifully during the exhibition. Starlings' were not
particularly well represented, but there were some very charming
birds present, many of which chattered away as merrily as ever
a Starling chattered upon a house-top.
Mr. Fulljames' Chough was easily at the top of the class
for " Magpies, Jackdaws, Jays, and Choughs;" but the second-
prize winner, Messrs. Kilbury Bros.' Magpie " Sirdar," was a
truly magnificent bird, and an excellent talker and mimic. The
third prize was won by a Jay belonging to Mr. T. Blower. Mr.
Housden's Chough appeared to me to be a hen.
The class for abnormally coloured specimens of British
birds is always interesting, and on this occasion was well up to
the average. First came Mr. Fulljames' Cinnamon Starling, a
most beautiful bird which has before been mentioned in our
Magazine. The second prize went to a very differently coloured
bird of the same species -- its entire plumage being of a beautiful
silver-grey tint. A very pretty Bullfinch came third--an albino
with a very delicate pink tint on the cheeks.
Other interesting "freaks" were, two pure white House
Sparrows, a black Bullfinch, a cinnamon Chaffinch, and a white
Thrush.
Next came the class for any other variety of the smaller
insectivorous residents. The first prize was awarded to a Tree-
creeper sent by Mrs. W. H. Field ; it did not look particularly
happy, but it was uncommon as a Show bird, and therefore, I

suppose, worth a first prize. The second prize went to a nice
Wren belonging to Mr. Maxwell. The third prize was given to
a Nuthatch. A beautiful little Marsh-tit was sent by Messrs.
F. and R. Howe, which did not receive a card of any description
and was marked "Absent" in the Catalogue. It was one of the
nicest birds in the class. A very beautiful pair of Bearded-tits,
in splendid plumage, were also entirely overlooked by the Judge.
There were three Long-tailed-tits, a Great-tit, and a Blue-tit
exhibited, as well as a Pied, and a Grey, Wagtail.
In the class for larger insectivorous residents, a very nice
Missel Thrush took the first prize. The winner of the second
was the Greater-spotted Woodpecker which took the first prize
in this class at the October Show. There were three Greater-
spotted Woodpeckers in this class, curiously enough all hens.
The third prize was awarded to a Grey Wagtail, a bird that
should have been entered in the previous class, and had no right
to compete in a class for birds larger than a Woodlark.
The next class contained some very fine Nightingales and
Blackcaps, most of which appeared to be in most perfect health
and condition.
The class for Insectivorous Migrants contained an inter-
esting collection. A Chiff-chaff received the first prize, which it
well deserved. A hen Wheatear in beautiful condition, belonging
to Mr. Upton, came second, and the third prize w T as w r ell earned
by a Great Grey Shrike, the property of Mr. W. Cook. Mr.
Russell Humphrys exhibited a Pied Flycatcher, a bird not often
seen on the Show-bench. Three very nice Red-wings were
shown, as well as two good Ring Ouzels, two White-throats,
some Yellow Wagtails, and a Redstart.
The Migratory Seed-eaters formed a large class, more than
half of w 7 hich were Bramblefinehes. A very good Bramble-
finch, belonging to Mr. Fulljames, received the first prize, the
second going to a nice Snow Bunting exhibited by Mr. Lowne.
An Ortolan came third ; and there were also exhibited five Mealy
Redpolls and four Crossbills.
The class for European birds not included in the N. B. B.
and M. C. List was not very well filled, but contained some very
interesting exhibits. Mr. Fulljames' Blue-throat is an exquisite
little bird, and was rightly awarded first prize. No second
prize was given in this class. The same gentleman's Rock
Thrush received the third prize, wdiilst his Orphean Warbler, a
bird well w T orth the second prize, had to be content with the
fourth place. Tw r o novel and interesting exhibits in this class

go
were a Lapwing and a Sandpiper, neither of which received a
card of any description. Not being included in the N. B. B. and
M. C. List, these two species, which are as truly British as any
birds in the Show, have to go into a class for Continental birds,
where the hard-hearted Judge will have nothing to do with them.
They were in fine condition, and a great addition to the interest
of the exhibition ; surely their owner should have received some
encouragement. Mr. Russell Humphrys sent a Barred Warbler
(Sylvia nisoriaj but it was sadly out of condition, although a
very interesting exhibit. D. Seth-Smith.
FOREIGN BIRDS (other than parrots).
Whydahs, Weavers, and Comb a sous. This was not a very
interesting class--it seldom is at a February Show. There were
several specimens of the Long-tailed Whydah, one Red-collared
Wliydah, and Mr. Fulljames' celebrated Resplendent Whydah,
now out of colour--also several commoner species. The first
prize went to the Red-collared.
Common Waxbills. This class was better filled than at
the Odtober Show, but the quality was poor. The first prize was
awarded to a pair of Avadavats--the male was very bright, but
they were not in the very best condition and appeared to be
newly-imported. The second and fourth prizes were awarded
to Golden-breasted Waxbills, and the third to Avadavats. Oddly
enough, the exhibits in these classes for common birds (in which
condition is the only merit) seem usually in much worse con-
dition than those in the classes for rarer birds.
All other species of Waxbills. Here were fewer entries
than in October, but the class was a fairly good one. The
interest centred in Mr. Hawkins' exhibits, which secured the
first and third prizes--a single cock being entered as Pytelia
melba (a) and two females or immature birds as Pytelia afra --
whether these three birds really belonged to two species I cannot
undertake to say. There were two female Violet-eared Waxbills,
Crimson Finches, Lavender Finches, Cordon Bleus, an Aurora
Finch, and one pair and a single specimen of the Rufous-tailed
Finch.
Gouldian Finches, Parrot Finches, &amp; Pin-tailed Nonpareils.
Here was a good show of both varieties of Gouldian Finches and
the common Parrot Finch. There was one pair of Pin-tailed
Nonpareils, which received the fourth prize. A Bunting Non-
pareil had got into this class by mistake. (By the way, this

was the only "wrong classed" entry in the classes judged by
Dr. Simpson, which shews the usefulness of the " notes" in the
schedule). The rare birds in this class were the first prize
winners, belonging to Mr. Hawkins, and entered simply as
" Parrot Finches,"--these were three-coloured Parrot Finches,
inasmuch as they had a blue face, a red throat and tail, and a
green bod}^, but they were not the species usually called the
" Three-coloured Parrot Finch," which is, I believe, Erythrura
trichroa. I fail to identify these birds with any species in the
Cat. Birds Brit. Mus.
Parson, Diamond, and Zebra Finches. Here were eleven
entries, mostly Parson and Diamond Finches, and, on the whole,
a very poor lot.
All other Grass/inches. Five entries of Dong-tailed Grass-
finches, three of Bicheno's Finches, and one each of Cherry
Finches, Red-headed Finch, and White-eared Grassfinch.
Java Sparrows presented nothing of interest.
All other Mannikins. A miserable class. Three pairs of
Magpie Mannikins, one pair of Bengalese, and a solitary
Chestnut Finch.
Ca?&apos;dinals. Here again was a poor show. One cock
Virginian, two entries of Green Cardinals, and three of Red-
crested Cardinals.
All other species of Grosbeaks, True Finches, and Bitntings.
This was a very good class. The first prize was awarded to a
Black-headed Siskin, the second to Mr. Seth-Smith's fine pair of
Passer luteus, the third to a pair of rare Serins belonging to Mr.
Frostick, the fourth to a Pileated Pmch, and the fifth to an
Alario Finch. There was another Black-headed Siskin, two
Reddish Finches belonging to Mr. Swaysland, a pair of Sycalis
arvensis belonging to the same exhibitor, as well as Saffron
Benches, Indigo Buntings, Nonpareils, and Green and Grey
Singing Finches.
Tanagers, Sugar Birds, and Zosterops. The first prize
winner was Mr. Townsend's very fine specimen of Dacnis
cayana, in full male plumage. The second prize went to Mr.
Fulljames' Tri-coloured Tanager. The third prize was awarded
to Mr. H. B. Smith's Scarlet Tanager. The fourth prize to
Mrs. Field's Blue and Black Tanager. The fifth to a very
rare and beautiful Tanager belonging to Mr. Fulljames, which
might have been higher up. This last-mentioned bird was
slightly larger than the Scarlet Tanager, with head and throat
slate-blue; mantle black; primaries and tail-feathers blue

edged with black ; underparts yellow, divided from the slate-
coloured throat by an irregular band of black across the breast ;
rump yellow; feathers round eyes, and lores, black. There were
several other Tanagers, mostly of common species, and two or
three Zosterops (all of the Grey-backed species).
Crows, Jays, etc. First, Mr. Housden's Wandering Tree
Pie (Pies according to the Catalogue, but there was only one bird
in the cage). Second, Mr. Humphrys' amusing Black-throated
Grackle. Third, Mr. Fulljames' Crimson - headed Starling.
Fourth, Mr. Henderson's Blue Jay. Fifth, Mr. H. B. Smith's
Purple-headed Glossy Starling. The class included besides,
Andaman, Black-headed, and Malabar Starlings, a Miniature
Glossy Starling, Blue-bearded and Blue-hooded Jays, and some
Brazilian Hangnests. A very good class.
Doves and Qiiails. Contained a nice pair of Jungle Bush
Quails and four entries of Doves. The first prize went to Mr.
Housden's Nicobar Pigeons--I suppose stridtly a Pigeon is a
Dove and a Dove a Pigeon, but these large Pigeons are scarcely
what we commonly understand by the word " Dove."
All other species of Foreign Birds . This class, which is
practically a class for soft-food birds, was at this Show separated
from the other soft-billed classes by the Parrots--this would
have been avoided if the Parrot classes had been placed first,
as they were in Odtober. It was a large class of 23 entries,
and needs division. First, Mr. Fulljames' pair of Australian
Wood Swallows -- rather mopish birds of a sooty-grey colour,
with bluish-grey primaries and tail feathers. The bill did not
appear to have any of the characteristics of the Swallow.
Second, Mr. Humphrys' Great Racquet-tailed Drongo. Third,
Mr. Humphrys' Blue-winged Green Bulbul. Fourth, Mr.
Fulljames' Green Tonraco. Fifth, Mrs. Field's Toucan. The
class also comprised a pair of Lewin's Honey-eaters and a pair
of Yellow Honey-eaters ; no less than three pairs of the Warty-
faced Honey-eaters, more curious than beautiful ; a Greenish
Honej^-eater ; a Grey-winged Blackbird; an Indian Barbet ; a
Crimson-crested Touraco, kept out of the prize list by defective
claws ; another Toucan of a different species from the prize-
winner; and several common birds.
One of the most interesting exhibits to the aviculturist
was to be found in the Hybrid section. This was Dr. Butler^s
Canary-Saffron Finch--which has so often been declared to be
an impossibility. I examined the bird carefully, and, so far as I
could judge, its appearance bore out its reputed ancestry in
every respect. Horatio R. Firemer.

The class (122) for Doves or Quails is always a failure;
probably because few aviculturists have really tame specimens of
the genus which they can with safety catch and cage. 1st prize
{the only prize aw r arded) went this year, as last, I think, to Mr.
Housden's pair of Nicobar Pigeons ; they are in beautiful
condition and fine of their kind. Personally, I cannot admire
the vulturine look of the species, and have grave doubts as to
their being eligible. I certainly thought Mr. Seth-Smith's little
pair of Jungle Bush Quails (Perdicula asiaticaJ, which are both
rare and interesting, worthy of a 2nd if not of 1st prize. Mr. H. B.
Smith's cock Bronze-wing (H. C.) is a handsome bird, I should
think a Tasmanian one ; for it has that excessive ruby brilliance
of wing which is found in Tasmanian rather than Australian
specimens.
The class for Budgerigars requires little comment. Mr.
Arthur's birds, as usual, were striking for their size and condition,
so indeed, in a lesser degree, were the other winners.
The class (124) for Rosellas and Pennants was fairly filled.
Mr. Arthur's pair of Pennants, 1st, are handsome birds in fine
plumage. Mr. Housden's, 2nd, an exceptionally handsome
single Pennant. Its companion had unfortunately died just
after its arrival at the Show ; if it was as good as the survivor
they must have taken first honours. The 3rd prize went to Mr.
Arthur for a fair Mealy Rosella. I thought Dr. Grigg's V. H. C.
pair of Red Rosellas particularly handsome.
Class 125, for King and Crimson-wing Parrakeets, had 10
entries, and was well divided between the two species. 1st was
awarded to Mr. Doherty's King and Queen, which, according to
the Catalogue, took the same honours in 1896 and 1897. They
did not look happy. Kings and Queens seldom do, while many
Crimson-wings are bright and lively, and seem quite to enjoy the
excitement of a Show. 2nd prize was awarded to a lovely
Crimson-wing shown by Mr. Maxwell, and 3rd to another nearly
as good, shown by Mr. Doherty.
Class 126, for "All species of Parrakeets not included in
the above," was a most varied and interesting one. The entries
numbered 23, and two extra prizes were very properly awarded.
1st deservedly was awarded to Mrs. Astrop's beautiful Pileated
Parrakeet, which, if I am not mistaken, has before carried off
the same honour; 2nd was Mr. Fulljames' charming Princess of
Wales Parrakeet (Polytelis alexandrcz )--its disposition seems to
Be like its soft colouring. Mr. Maxwell's hen Yellow-shouldered

Parralceet, lately so well depicted as an illustration in this
Magazine, was 3rd--I fear much that her appearance alone
means that the cock is either ill or dead. The two extra 3rd
prizes went to a lovely pair of Red-mantled Parrakeets shown
by Mr. Cocksedge, and to an equally good pair of Blue Bonnets
shown by Mr. Fulljames. I failed to find the latter gentleman's
entry of a Fiji Shining Parrakeet.
Class 127, " Lories and Lorikeets," were a decidedly good
class of 11, for nearly all were in good health and plumage. Mr.
Housden's, 1st, Ceram Tory (not, as in the Catalogue, Forsten's
Torikeet) is a great beauty ; Mr. Fulljames' 2nd prize bird is a
Forsten's ; the striking contrast of colour in this species is
most attractive. Mr. Maxwell's, 3rd prize, Scaly-breasted
Torikeeet is also a very nice specimen. Of the other entries,
I think I admired most Mr. Grier's (#) V. H. C. Ceram Tory.
128, " Tovebirds, including Hanging Parrots." It is re-
markable what a number of Peach-faced Tovebirds are now seen,
and all, as a rule, in good condition ; ten years ago they were rare.
The class almost consisted of them. 1st was awarded to Mr.
Fulljames, for a pair of Red-crowned Hanging Parrakeets--
--last year there were specimens also of the Blue-crowned. Mr.
Frostick's 2nd prize, Mr. Storey's 3rd, and Mr. Cooper's V. H. C.
were all good pairs of Peach-faced Tovebirds.
129, "Amazons and Greys." A fine class of 17, though fine:
rather for the general good condition of the exhibits than for the
great rarity of any. A handsome Tevaillant's Amazon, shown by
Mrs. Newmarch, took 1st honours ; Mr. Hughes' Grey, in lovely
condition, 2nd ; and Mrs. Cooper's Spectacle Amazon, 3rd.
V. H. Commendations were awarded to a good Yellow-fronted
Amazon shown by Mr. Hudson, and a Mealy shown by Mr.
Woodfield.
Class 130, "All species of Parrot not included in the above,"
was an interesting class. Mr. Fulljames' 1st and 2nd winners
being really rare. The former, a White-headed Parrot, at first
sight looked like an Amazon, and I learn was once passed as
such by a distinguished judge. It is a Piomts senilis ; the latter
is a Bronze-winged Parrot ( Pionus chalcopterus). Mr. Maxwell's
Hawk-headed Parrot was placed 3rd, and an extra 3rd was most
properly awarded to Mr. Fulljames' pair of Meyer's. Several
fine Eclectus of both sexes appeared.
Class 131. But three Macaws were shown, all of well-
(b). " Grier " was a misprint in the Catalogue. The exhibitor was Mr. Albert Green.--Ed.

known varieties. Mr. Fulljames' winner, a Hyacinthine, is a
grand specimen.
Class 132. Cockatoos, were not a good or interesting
collection. 1st prize was not awarded ; 2nd went to Mr.
Housden's cock Leadbeater, and 3rd to Mr. Fulljames' Blood-
stained. I wonder what has become of the Gangas shown last
year.
On the whole, I have seen better and more interesting
Shows of Parrots and Parrakeets ; it is remarkable how much of
the beauty and interest of the Show depends on the exhibits of
about three gentlemen.

Sir,--I do not know whether we have any amateur photographers
among our members.
To those among us who follow the " foe-to-graphic-art " I suggest the
formation of a postal circulating club, to be mainly for the encouragement
of the photographing of caged birds.
A short time ago a photo-engraving of a Hawfinch appeared in the
Feathered World. This was a good illustration, but spoilt by the presence of
the wires in front of the bird. The enclosed photo, (c) shows that the cage-
wires need not be apparent.
It seems to be a great pity that good specimens of caged birds should
not be invariably photographed, and many of them photo-engraved. Take
the illustration last month. I would much sooner have had an uncoloured
photo-print than a chromo, the accuracy of which I must take on trust (d).
Newlv-caged birds or those that have become reconciled to confinement are
usually in the best plumage ; but some are very bad sitters when freshly-
caged. For instance, Chaffinches, Robins, and the usually cpiiet Hedge
Sparrow. A Kingfisher on the attention, which can only be photographed
wild under exceptional circumstances, will sit well in a cage. (I am now
trying to get one for the purpose). Hawks and Owls are good subjects.
I should be glad to hear from anyone willing to join a Cage-Bird
Photo. Club. Chas. Louis Hett.

from the Island of Tobago, which lies N. E. of Trinidad and S. E. of
Grenada.
In May, 1S98, our member, Mr. J. C. Pool, of Birmingham, received
a consignment of Doves from Barbados and among them, I think, five
examples from Tobago, which were forwarded under the name of Columba
corensis; all the latter had had their wings more or less clipped and were
somewhat rough in feathering. Knowing my liking for Doves, Mr. Pool
kindly exchanged a pair of Zenaida aurita and the supposed Columba corensis
for various birds which I had to spare.
I soon discovered that neither of the species to which C. corensis is
assigned as a synonym answered in the least to my birds, and after looking
through the Museum collection of skins of Columba I was still at fault.
Looking through Temminck's work, I believed I had spotted the bird
on pi. 25 bis as the supposed young of Zenaida aurita , and turning to the
Catalogue I found Count Salvadori's note -- ' seems to belong to a different
species' ; so there I was floored again. From that day forward I was no
nearer to an identification ; for, although one of the birds proved to have
been pinioned and will never be able to fly, both remain in excellent
health ; so that I must eventually have caged one of them and taken it to
town for identification. Now, however, I have looked at the solitary
Museum skin (said to have come from Grenada) and know my birds to be
Leptoptild wellsi.
I find this one of the most timid Doves with which I have had to do;
and, unlike most species of Columbidce, somewhat irritable ; objecting to
small birds perching on a branch near it, and running to drive them away :
it is softly pleasing, but by no means brilliant, in colouring.
A. G. Butler.
THE RUFOUS-TAILED GRASSFINCH.
Sir, --I read with much interest and pleasure the article on this
pretty finch by Mr. Seth-Smith, which appeared in the February number of
the Magazine. The plate represents a fine male bird, and I think one I now
have in my aviary is about as handsome; but the red marking of the face
has been less vivid in several cock birds I have seen on this side of the
Channel.
My own experience with these lovely little birds has, unfortunately,
been limited to one pair, purchased in November, 1897. The hen was
rather delicate from the first, and died when about to lay, last spring. The
cock (referred to above) is still in good health and plumage, and wintered
in my unheated aviary, but where it never freezes, without any apparent ill
effects, this year. Since the loss of the hen, I have not been able to find
another of the species to mate with the cock, much to my regret, for he
seems most anxious to nest. At the present moment he is rather " sweet "
on a hen Australian Crimson-finch (who, by the way, has a brutal partner
wdiose chief occupation is chasing and trying to maltreat her--both the
Crimson-finches are aviary-bred), but she resents him and his attentions,
and seems to prefer her decidedly brutal mate to the gallant Ruficauda and
his affections. If she were only slightly inclined to accept his advances, I
think I would cage them alone and try the experiment of breeding hybrids,
and leave the cock Crimson-finch to himself.

Seeing the difficulty in procuring a hen Rufous-tail, I paired the
cock last year with a hen Australian Zebra Finch ; and, as they built a
nest, laid eggs, and sat well, I was rather hopeful of obtaining the cross.
I never had any young, though, and after about a month's steady incu-
bation the eggs (3) were thrown out of the nest and broken ; all seemed
clear. I should like to know if this cross is considered obtainable. I think
I have read, somewhere, Dr. Butler has tried the same experiment, but, if I
remember rightly, with opposite sexes to my birds, i.e., hen Rufous-tail, and
cock Zebra Finch. I do not remember to have seen the result published ;
perhaps he would kindly give the information in the Magazine (e).
Rufous-tails are certainly scarce this way (France) and, notwith-
standing my various applications for a hen, by letters and advertisements, I
have not been able to find one since I lost mine. They are, in my opinion,
among the best of foreign aviary-finches, and it is peculiar they are so
rarely imported.
I regret Mr. Seth-Smith did not succeed in obtaining any young
from the pair that nested in his aviary; other amateurs have, unfortunately,
met with the same disappointment that he did. The nest they build (in a
bush generally) is, in many cases, a flimsy structure, so much so that the
eggs frequently fall through it during incubation ; and this may explain, to
a certain extent, the egg-tasting and eating the species is addicted to. The
hen may be the culprit. A friend of mine, who had a pair nesting in a
cage, says he saw his hen eating the eggs. The nest they built with him
was a slender affair in the green-food rack. I11 spite of their egg-eating
propensity, Rufous-tails have been bred by four amateurs, to my knowledge,
in France, and I have had bird-dealings with two of the gentlemen who
bred them. One gentleman reared, a few years ago, some fifteen young
from several pairs. If I had a pair that laid in a nest too fragile to support
the eggs and birds during incubation, I should try to strengthen the nest
underneath with liav or some other nesting material; this has been done
in this country, and the eggs, in several instances, were saved from falling
through the nest and being broken.
I think the first importation of these birds into France was in 1894,
which was the year in which they seem to have made their first appearance
in England. A. SAVAGE.
Sir,--I n August, 1S97, a pair of these birds made a neat domed nest
of hay and bents in a tuft of grass in one of my aviaries. Two young left
the nest, but succumbed to a wet chilly night two or three days afterwards.
The} 7 were of a pale brown colour, and were excessively wild, and I could
not induce them to remain in the covered part of the aviary, the door of
which had to be left open on account of other nesting birds. Unike Mr.
Setli-Smith's birds, my pair offered no hostilities to their aviary companions;
even a pair of Cordon Bleus, incubating in a box-busli six feet away, were
not interfered with. For some reason, the birds, this last summer, though
apparently in the best of health, have not bred : possibly because, hoping
to induce them to select a more dry and sheltered site for their nest, I kept
the grass-plot cut close. W. H. ST. Ouintin.
(e). No eggs apparently were laid, but the hen sat in the nest until she somehow
managed to tear her abdomen, probably ag&apos;ainst some projecting point in the wire netting,
and died. -- A. G. B.

THR LICENSING OF BIRD-CATCHERS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999486673469388" page_id="32638467"  page_num="Page 98" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- Tlie proposed adtion of the Society for the Protection of Birds
\0x25A0with regard to the licensing of bird-catchers will, I have no doubt, meet
with the approval of all our members who claim to be true naturalists.
All who are acquainted with the extent to which bird-catching is
carried on from the first of August onwards, especially around London and
along the South Coast, cannot but realise that the imposition of a license
upon bird-catchers is sure to result in the increase of our native songsters.
The mere licensing of bird-catchers is, however, hardl} 7 all that is necessary
if we are to long retain the Goldfinch as a British wild bird. There can be
no doubt that if this and certain other species are to be saved from extermi-
nation the close time must be extended. The cultivation of land, which was
formerly overgrown with thistles and other weeds, may have had something
to do with the thinning of the number of Goldfinches, but I believe the
bird-catcher has far the most to answer for in this respect. There are still
large tracts of uncultivated land in England where Goldfinches can find
isustenance if only the bird-catchers will give them a chance ; there are still
localities where the cheerful twitter of Carduelis may any day be heard
but where, year by year, he is becoming scarcer.
It is w 7 ell known that the Goldfinch is a decidedly late breeder.
Every mule-breeder knows well enough that it is practically useless to
attempt to breed Goldfinch mules until quite late in the spring, and that
cock Goldfinches are often read}' enough to go on breeding after most
Canaries have commenced the autumnal moult. Thus it is that at the
beginning of August, when the bird-catchers commence work, not only are
there numbers of young Goldfinches which, although flying, are still
dependent upon their parents for food, but many are still actually in the
nest. At this time of the year both old and young (but far more of the
latter than the former) are readily attracted to the bird-catchers' nets by
the call-birds, and are taken in considerable numbers. As before stated,
most of the young birds taken at this time of the year are absolutely
incapable of feeding themselves, and consequently die from starvation.
Even those that are able to eat soft seeds are quite incapable of digesting
the hard fare provided by their captors. I have several times conversed
with bird-catchers upon this subject, and have pointed out the folly and
cruelty of capturing these " grey-pates," as they are called at this stage of
their existence, and the bird-catchers have often admitted that 90 per cent,
of these young birds are sure to die within a week or so.
The adult birds taken in August very likely have families which can-
not exist without them, and which are thus certain to die from starvation.
In my opinion, the only way to preserve the Goldfinch is to extend
the close season to the beginning or middle of September; the birds taken
after this are perfectly able to feed themselves and there is a good chance
of their living. Aviculturists are not, as a rule, over-given to false
sentiment, and they do not object to the capture of adult birds that will
have a good chance of living and doing well in captivity ; but I feel sure
that a good many of our members will agree that the capture of young
Goldfinches which cannot feed themselves, except, perhaps, upon soft green
seeds, and which are practically certain to die of starvation, should be put
a stop to, and I do not doubt that if the Societj^ for the Protection of Birds,

TRAVELLING-CAGES FOR DOVES--A SUGGESTION.

Sir, --In perusing Mr. Cresswell's interesting article on Doves in last
month's Magazine, I note he alludes to the greet difficulty in importing the
little Barbados Turtle Doves ( Chamaspelia passerina). Would it not be
possible to overcome this difficulty by providing padded boxes with false
canvas tops, etc., or making a skeleton box, covering it with fine canvas,
then putting it in another, allowing, say IJ inches between top and sides.
Of course it would have to be made fast, and the front more or less open.
I have noticed that Quails, imported alive into Leeds market, always
come in very shallow crates, not more than 6 inches high and 3 or 4 feet
long--they seem to be packed like herrings in a box. This appears to
answer, as they look strong and lively.

GRASS-SEEDS FOR WAXBILLS.

Sir,--A s it is impossible to tell the varieties of food that foreign birds
feed on in their native land, it is one's duty to give the little prisoners
change of diet that will be of benefit to them when kept in confinement.
Doubtless, grass-seeds of kinds make up for the loss of some of tlieir
favourite dainties. Some time ago, in addition to the staple foods of m v
Waxbills, a grass mixture was added, but it was treated like all seed
mixtures--quick turns left and right with the beak, to select the favourite
seed, at the expense of a lot wasted.
As some of the grasses had, if I may so express it, "no inside," a
careful selection was made of the kinds that had "kernels," or an interior
tliat could be shucked. Out of this "survival of the fittest" I give the
names of three or four of the cheapest, the prices varying from 4d. to 8d.
per pound.
Meadow Fescue (Festuca pratensis ).
Timothy (Phleinn pratense).
Sutton's Dwarf Perennial Rye Grass (Loliumperenne suttoni ).
Plantain, or Rib Grass, they also seemed to appreciate. Some others
of the expensive grasses (such as Dogstail) were highly esteemed, but as the
price was 2/6 per pound, they are not mentioned, as the lesser priced seeds
answer all the purpose.
To those who have small cages and only room for one sort of grass at
a time, a fresh variety can be added daily. In my case the seeds are placed
in rows in night-light glasses on a shelf, easily got at from the perch, and
each bird seems to have a special liking for a certain grass, and can take
his or her choice, and there is but little waste in the feeding.

CRIMSON FINCHES AND RUFOUS-TAILED FINCHES.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99094103125" page_id="32638469"  page_num="Page 100" year="" vol="">
Sir, --My experience of Crimson Finches bears out the general
opinion. I bought two cocks and a hen in November, 1897. They lived
peaceably in a cage by themselves (as I did not put them into my aviarv-
cage) until last August. There the cocks were always pulling out the hen's
tail and maltreating her. I caught her out to let her tail grow in peace, and
then the two cocks began fighting furiously. So I put back the hen and
took away the most quarrelsome of the cocks. I was never able to put him
back, as each time I tried it he flew at the other cock, and I had to interfere
at once.
I, therefore, parted with him, and, as the other cock and hen showed
nesting desires, I put them in a larger cage with materials for building.
The cock soon built a lovely domed nest of moss, and sprays of flowering
grass. He did nearly all the building, but the hen used to sit in the nest a
good deal. She laid two eggs, but never sat on them, and after allowing
due time to elapse, I took away eggs and nest, and put the birds back in
their smaller cage for the winter. This year I shall try them again in the
summer.
I was much interested in Mr. Seth-Smitli's account of his Rufous-
tailed Grassfinches. My cock died in June, 1898, but my hen is still in
beautiful plumage ; in fact she almost resembles a young cock, and has
much more red about her face than the hen in the coloured picture. Had
she notproved her sex by laying eggs, one might have doubted it. I bought
the pair three years ago, and they seem to be hardy birds.
I may mention that I was told I might keep a Crimson Finch hen
with other birds, so I have an odd hen in my aviary cage, but she is inclined
to be quarrelsome at times and bullies a pair of White-cheeked Grassfinches
especially. However, I hope I shall not have to banish her, as she is a very
pretty bird. My cock Crimson Finch is a picture of colour now.
I have a solitary specimen of Lagonosticta 7 -nfopicta: I believe Mr.
Abrahams calls them Ruddy Fire Finches. It is a lovely- little bird. ^ I
obtained a pair from Dresden last August, but the hen died.

THE SIBERIAN JAY.
f Perisoreus infaustusJ.
By E. G. B. Meadk-Waldo.
I do not recollect to have seen any account of this bird in

confinement; nor to have ever seen one, with the exception of
three that I have had, one of which is still in perfect health and
condition in my aviary.
The Siberian Jay has a very wide range--from the North
of Norway in the West, throughout Northern Russia to Kam-
sckatka in the East. It is a bird of the spruce-forest, and its
sober colouring, of light and dark chestnut and ash colour,
harmonizes wonderfully with the red bark of the spruce fir, and
the various shades of grey of the lichens which festoon its
branches, in the vast forests that form its home. It has but
one near ally, the Canadian "Whiskey Jack," (a bird so often
read of and so seldom seen) and it is almost, if not quite, as
confiding in its wild state as the Canadian Jay is reported to be.
It will not allow itself to be caught by the simple method of
. picking it up, or baiting the palm of one's hand and suddenly
shutting it! But it will unconcernedly search the branches and
bark of the trees for insedts within a yard of you. In confine-
ment it is not much tamer than in its wild state, but it will
quickly come and feed from the hand.
However, I have never had any but wild-caught birds.
My first specimen was procured in a curious manner. A friend
was shooting elk in Norway, and, wishing for some Jays for
skins, shot at this one, which, on receiving the shot, calmly "put
its head under its wing," and went to sleep ; a man climbed up
and took it from its perch, and packed it up and put it away
until next morning, when it was found to be alive and well. It
was presented to me, and I had it for five years, when it died in
a fit,

The Siberian Jay is not a bird suitable for a cage : it is an
example of perpetual motion, flying up and down, climbing,
hanging, searching everything for insects, examining its
" hoards,"--for it hides everything it cannot eat, and always
makes a reserve of some special dainty in the pouch under its
tongue. It is very amusing to hold out a caterpillar or meal-
worm when it has its pouch full--it will make room by bringing
up the pellet of food, balance it on a perch, come and take the
mealworm and swallow it, and pouch the pellet again ( a ). It is
omnivorous, but does not care for any farinaceous food if it can
get anything else. It likes fruit, and is particularly fond of
elderberries. Beetles are the most favourite of all food, and in
Spring I feed mine largely on cockchaffers, which it prefers to
anything.
The plumage is wonderfully dense and curiously hairy in
texture, as would be expected from a bird which has to withstand
the intense cold of North Siberian forests in Winter. It is
extraordinary how these birds, the Pied Woodpeckers, and the
Tits can support life during the long winter's night that lasts
for weeks; for they do not migrate, and their food principally
consists of eggs and pupae of insects hidden in the bark of
trees, as the whole country is ice-bound.
This Jay is a wonderful mimic, and its own voice is
delightfully wild and musical ; it has, however, a great variety
of cries, some of which are perhaps rather the reverse. It is
altogether a most charming and interesting bird, and a delightful
pet to any one who does not demand something 1 &apos; gaudy."

The remarkable birds forming the family Podicipedidce
of ornithologists have long possessed for me especial interest,
and I venture herewith to record my observations on several of
the species, which I have had the good fortune to study in
captivity, and thus to observe under conditions which have, I
hope, enabled me to set at rest some doubts concerning certain
particulars in their economy.

I shall follow wherever possible the nomenclature and
arrangement of Mr. H. E. Dresser, who, in his Birds of Europe,
Vol. VIII., has given excellent figures and accounts of most of
the species with which I shall here have occasion to deal.
I. Podiceps cristatus. The Great Crested Grebe.
In January 1896 I procured from the Calcutta Bazaar a
fine specimen of this species, which, however, had its legs broken
or dislocated at the hock. In consequence of this, though the
feet retained their normal position, it was quite helpless on land,
and could only paddle very feebly in the water.
I nevertheless kept it for some days closely confined in a
small cage, in the hope that the injured limbs might recover, but
although the bird, after a day or two, fed well upon fish, and
seemed strong and lively, its feet got no better ; and when I
ultimately turned it out on the Museum compound tank it soon
disappeared, having probably drifted ashore and been stolen, or
fallen a prey to some jackal.
When confined, though, as above noted, it took ordinary
fish readily (I have seen it eat a dozen as long as large sprats
and thicker, and then want more) it did not seem to like prawns,
nor did it eat a small siluroid fish which I offered.
On two occasions I saw it deliberately eat one of its own
feathers which came out while it was pluming itself, an operation
in which, like Grebes generally, it was exceedingly assiduous.
It did not, however, reproduce either feathers or fish-bones
in the form of " castings," as suspected by Yarrell (British
Birds, Vol. IV., p. 121, Fourth Edition) ; I am certain of this,
having had the bird under such close observation. I did,
however, notice that its excrement was gritty, as if containing
particles of comminuted bone; and I think that anyone who
reads the evidence given on this point by Thompson in his
"Birds of Ireland," Vol. III., pp. 173-189 (reference given by
Yarrell loc. cit.&apos;) will agree with me that there is every reason to
believe that this points to the conclusion that no castings are
formed, and that feathers and bones are either actually digested
or passed out in a comminuted condition.
This bird was of course in winter plumage, but kept its
short ruff and ear-tufts expanded when in the cage. The bill
was pink except the upper chap at the tip along the ridge and
down to the nostrils where it was dark lead-colour. The iris
was brilliant red.
Owing to the crippled condition of the bird I was unable
to make any observations as to the power of walking in this

species ; but this deficiency I was able to supply when at home
on leave in October, 1897, a young bird having been acquired by
the London Zoological Gardens. This specimen, as my own had
been, was very savage, drawing blood freely from my hands
when I attempted to make it move. Although inclined merely
to squat and shove itself along, it could and did walk ; but with
reluctance, and for a short distance only, standing up on its toes
and waddling along very clumsily. It frequently used its wings
to aid it when running, these being full-grown ; though the head
was still covered with variegated down, already indicating the
form of the ornamental plumage on this part.
Some years ago, also in the London Zoological Gardens, I
was able to observe the specimen of the large American Grebe,
Podiceps (. PEchmophorus ) major , which the Society then possessed.
This also seemed able to advance only a few steps at a time--
waddling along a little way, and then flopping down on its
breast--although it had been some time in the gardens, and was
presumably in good health and not cramped or frightened ; the
latter conditions obtaining to a certain extent in the case of
the Great Crested Grebe above alluded to, for this was better on
its legs the second time I saw it.
Podiceps nigricollis. The Eared Grebe.
On February nth, 1897, I got a male individual of this
species from the Calcutta Bazaar, a sufficiently remarkable
locality for it. This bird was weakly, and I found it dead on
the third day after I obtained it, though it had fed freely on
small prawns and fish. It was gentle and did not peck. Though
I had it for at least one night in a cage, I found no " castings ; "
yet, as in the case of the large species, I twice saw it eat one of
its own feathers. It walked freely, several yards at a time, in an
ei&apos;ect position, as stated by Dresser, who correctly figures it and
other Grebes in this attitude. It had the bill lead-grey, dark 011
the ridge down to the nostrils, and whitish at the base and on
the under surface of the mandible. The iris was reddish orange,
with a yellowish-white inner ring, and the feet olive-leaden,
dark on the under surface of the toes and the outer side of the
shank.
The specimen has been stuffed in the standing attitude for
the Bird gallery in the Indian Museum.
Podiceps fluviatilis. The European Dabchick.
I once observed the gait of this bird on land, in the case
of a specimen confined in the aviary in the Fish-House at the
London Zoological Gardens. It walked on its toes in the
</bodyText>

I0 5
ordinary manner of birds, with an awkwardness which reminded
me at the time of a diving duck, only in this case it was even
more marked, as might be expected. I have often observed this
species in a wild state, and have once seen it half run, half fly,
over a narrow strip of grassy ground between two ponds ; other-
wise I never saw it ashore when wild. But to argue from this
that it cannot walk would be like denying the cat the power of
swimming because that beast is proverbially averse from water.
Podiceps cilbipennis (Sharpe). The Indian Dabchick.
I have had many examples ol this species of various ages,
and have consequent^ had ample opportunities of observing it.
It frequently remains standing up for some time, and walks and
runs about quite actively, and can even jump a little, helping
itself frequently, when running, with its wings. Some specimens
are less ready and able to walk than others, and more inclined to
shove themselves along when squatting ; but I attribute this to
fatigue, or to flurry caused by fright. Any bird which is a
clumsy walker normally will naturally blunder in its gait when
hurried.
In the early part of December 1895, I got from the Bazaar
a young specimen of this bird which I kept for some time in a
cage, letting it out to swim and feed in any convenient receptacle
for water, from an earthenware pot to a large masonry tank. It
soon became remarkably tame, and before I had had it a week
was inclined to follow me about, and seemed restless when
confined and unable to get to me. I have let it out in my room
and have had it come and squat down by my feet. In fact, when a
photograph (b) was taken, I could not get the bird to stand still
unless my hand was near. At the same time it exhibited much
fear of natives, diving in fright when they approached, when it
would let me lift it out of the water in my hand. In addition to
intelligence, it showed much courage, on two occasions attacking
a dog, and once a Scissor-billed Tern, which easily beat it off:
the dog of course was not allowed the chance of retaliating.
Its power of resisting injury was also remarkable; on three
occasions (twice within a few minutes) it fell at least a yard on
to a stone or concrete floor, and was not hurt, though it did not
attempt to save itself with its wings.
The quills on these were not quite grown when I got it,
and the head was likewise covered with variegated down.
(6) This was not clear enough for reproduction,--most unfortunately, as it showed
the bird in its normal standing position; i.e., on its toes like an ordinary bird; though I
have seen it also in the plantigrade posture.--F.F.

While I had it confined I never saw it bring up " castings," nor
has this been the case with any of this species that I have kept ;
nor did I see any feathers swallowed by them, even in the case
of a moulting bird.
I ultimately turned this bird out on the tank of the
Museum compound, where, afier remaining tame for a day or
two, it speedily became wfild. It was inclined to associate with
a Coot, which did not appear to be anxious for its society ; but
towards the ducks I from time to time put on it exhibited what
looked very much like animosity, attacking them at first most
vigorously. I fancy, however, that this was merely juvenile
mischief, for it became more peaceable as it grew older.
When I placed the Great Crested Grebe above alluded to
on one occasion on the tank, its small relative hastily approached,
and diving below, could be easily seen through the clear w 7 ater
to come and peck the large bird's toe, afterwards rising to the
surface out of reach.
It hunted insects and crustaceans when at large, as well
as fish, and appreciated a varied diet of these when in captivity.
It often came out on to a piece of brickwork, especially at first,
to plume itself, and I have even seen it resting there.
I never saw this or any other specimen use its wings when
diving; when performing this action it used both feet together,
while in swimming it moved by alternate strokes.
This bird had lost nearly all its quills towards the end of
January 1896, though they had only recently been fully developed.
By this time also the head appeared to be feathered. On the 2nd
February the quills were nearly grown again, as I find from my
notes then taken.
In the following month (March) I procured an adult, and
turned this also out on the tank, and the two soon became friendly.
I observed before turning out the new bird that, although
hungry and searching for food with its head under (a common
action) in the water in which I placed it, it nevertheless refused
to eat a sharp-toothed Goby ; it took, however, a spider and
some mole-crickets. At the eud of March I noticed that this
specimen also had moulted all its quills, so that this must be
the usual mode of moulting in this species of Grebe at all
events fcj.
( c ) I have observed a similar complete moult of the quills in the Common Coot
[Fulica atra ) the Waterhen (Gallinula chlaropus ) and in a species of Porphyrio. In the case
of the Coot the observation has been previously made by St. John (Natural History and
Sport in Morayshire), but I noticed it independently on the tank here. The Moorhen I
noticed inSt.James'Park in 1897, and th &amp; Porphyrio in the Calcutta Zoological Gardens. -- F.F.

Soon after this I went to the Andamans, and on my return
could not distinguish with certainty my old pet from the new
Dabchick. I did see, indeed, one of them make a Whistling
Teal fivout of the water; and if this were the young bird at its
accustomed mischief, it had b)^ this time advanced nearly into
full breeding plumage, which was not the case with the other
bird ; but this is, I should think, unlikely.
After this one of these Dabchicks disappeared. I often
saw one fly short distances in the evening, and noticed that it
alighted " anyhow," letting the feet trail behind all the time,
and not putting them out in front like a duck or gull.
One of the birds, I think the same, remained on the tank
for at least a year after this, but ultimately disappeared. As
before indicated, I have had other specimens, and noted in these
also the power of walking denied to the Grebes by some
observers. On two occasions I experimented with some in order
to find out if they could rise off the ground and get on the wing.
The results of the experiments have left me somewhat in doubt
on this point. In the first case a bird let loose on a lawn was
able to raise itself a foot or so from the ground, and I note that it
" could evidently have flown off in good form." This was early in
1897, an d later in the same year I repeated the experiment with
another bird, which could hardly clear the ground, but it was, I
think, in a weak state, for it could not walk far at a time, and
when turned out on the tank came out of the water, a thing I
have seldom seen a healthy Dabchick do. In fact, I believe
these birds sleep in the water, judging from what I have seen.
The iris in this species is brownish yellow, but I noticed
that in my young bird it was hazel at first, and in a still younger
one, (downy all over, and with no feathers on the wings) it was
brown.
The beak is buff, black along the ridge, and green at angle
of mouth.

By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
As no article has yet appeared on these lovely little birds,
I have put together some notes on this rare species.
Bichenos are among the tiniest of the little finches that
come from Australia. I know of nothing so tiny as their little
legs and feet: they are more like little threads than legs.
The importation of Bichenos is very rare--only about
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.999019860465117" page_id="32638477"  page_num="Page 108" year="" vol="">
one a year, sometimes not even that; and consequently they
command high prices, and when their great delicacy on landing
is taken into account, they are literally, when acclimatised,
worth their weight in gold.
I should say that of the few pairs that come over nearly all
die within a few days of reaching their new homes, unless their
new owners are more than usually skilful in the difficult art of
hardening off. A friend of mine this spring bought two pairs,
and they were all dead but one within forty-eight hours. I
cannot, therefore, recommend Bichenos to everyone ; but if a
man really loves his birds and understands them, I would say,
try Bichenos. The nuisance is that Bichenos always come over
at the very coldest season of the year, usually about January ; so
this adds to the risks, as a cold journey will finish off these
tender little things.
Bichenos are marvellously active and pop about like little
mice, and it is no easy matter to catch an escaped one. I have
at the present moment quite a little flock of them, and they are
certainly great favourites of mine. They are very tame and
friendly (at least mine are), and will let me go quite close to
them in their big aviary without showing the least fear, and they
will feed all round my feet.
They are gregarious and keep together all day ; frequently
uttering their call-note to keep their mates apprised of their
positions. In an aviary they always sleep in a box warmly lined
with hay, and, when hardened, do not mind the cold a bit. My
oldest pair have been in a cold aviary all the year round, and are
always the first to take a cold bath, winter or summer.
The cock bird has a pretty little song -- diddy dee , diddy dee,
diddy -- repeated at intervals.
Their favourite food I find to be Indian millet, and some-
times they will take a little canary.
Bichenos are beautifully marked, especially on the wings,
where the black and white pencilling is exquisite. The front of
the head is black in the cock, and brownish rusty in the hen ; the
back snuff-brown ; the tail black ; the breast of the cock and the
cheeks dazzling snow-white, but the belly and underparts of the
hen are buffy-white.
I can pick out the sexes with tolerable certainty, but I
doubt if a beginner could. The surest test is the song, but then
I doubt if a cock newly come over would sing. I do not think
that the double band on the chest is any mark of sex. The
beak is bluish, and the legs and feet slate colour.

So far, I have not bred any ; but if we are to believe the
ease and readiness with which they are said to go to nest, I
ought to have done so long ago ; but then, we do not believe all
that the guides tell us. My own impression is that few are lucky
enough to keep Bichenos alive, let alone breed them. As I have
a small flock, I may be among the lucky few this year and breed
some; I hope I shall. I fancy that, like so many Australian
finches, nearly all the Bichenos that are imported are young
birds in their nest feathers ; as I notice mine change wonderfully
in the colour of their white parts.
Bichenos are very apt to " go light" when they first come
over; so that it is well in buying them to feel the breast bone,
as if it is at all sharp , they are "going home shortly." They
require to be very gradually hardened off, or you will infallibly
lose them.
For those who, like myself, admire something that is
wonderfully beautiful, rare, and difficult to keep, I say, try
Bichenos. To the ordinary amateur, I would say, let Bichenos
severely alone at any price.

Mr. Setli-Smith is, possibly, not aware that the Secretary of State
lias power, upon the application of the County Council, to make an
order for the protection of any species beyond the statutory close time, in
the whole or any part of the County. I believe I am correct in saying that
under orders already in force the Goldfinch is protected until the 31st of
August in London, Middlesex, Devon, Isle of Wight, Anglesea, Carvarvon,
East Suffolk, Durham, North Riding of Yorks., Huntingdon, Isle of Ely,
Liberty of Peterborough, all three divisions of Lincolnshire, and East
Sussex. This list is not exhaustive, for I think some recent orders are not
included.
To turn to the subject indicated by the heading, I should be glad to
receive suggestions as to the practical form which the scheme should
assume. In particular, I should like to elicit the opinion of members upon
the following points :--(1) What shall be the cost of the annual license ?
(2) Should dealers in foreign birds be licensed as well as dealers in British
birds ? (3) How should a dealer be defined, and what provisions would be
required to prevent any interference with the sale of birds by unlicensed
amateurs ?
Would it not be possible to prohibit the sale of cages under a certain
size, and make the use of such cages illegal after (say) three years from the
passing of the act ? And could not every licensed bird-dealer be compelled
to allow so many cubic inches of cage-space to each bird ?

Society for the Protection of Birds, and I shall be very pleased to enrol any

Sir, -- -With respect to your letter in the February Magazine, with
reference to registering bird-catchers, I am quite at one with you. When
one dealer receives 130 dozen birds of various kinds per week, as was
stated in the Daily Telegraph a few weeks ago, I think it is quite time some-
thing was done to prevent this wholesale catching, or shall I say slaughter:
as I am sure not one quarter of them can live in the small filthy cages they
are crowded into. I think each catcher should be registered and have a
certain district, and the number of birds he is allowed to capture should be
limited ; and the dealer also should not be permitted to have more than
one bird to a cubic foot of space. This matter could be seen into by the
Vestry Sanitary Inspectors of the various Parishes, as well as the sanitation
of the shops. I have been patiently waiting for a long time to see some-
thing done to stop the cruelty to our feathered friends ; now I feel sure my
expectations will be fully realised. I wish you would grapple with cayenne
feeding, and tailing and flighting (d).

PHOTOGRAPHING BIRDS.
Sir,---T he letter upon this subject, by Mr. Hett, which appeared in
the March number of this Magazine, touches upon a subject so interesting
to aviculturists that I think it should not pass without comment. The
formation of a Photographic Club among our members would be a capital
idea providing that a sufficient number would join, but I fear there are but
few who combine the two delightful hobbies of aviculture and photograph}&apos;.
I cannot believe that a photograph would be more appreciated by our
members than a coloured plate, especially when that coloured plate is from
a drawing by an artist who is noted for his careful and accurate delineation
of living birds. Neither do I believe that a photograph, however well
taken, is necessarily more accurate than a cliromo print.
The great drawback to photographs of birds is that, however truth-
fully the form and attitude of the subject may be portrayed, the colours are
not reproduced ; and, moreover, photographs of any coloured objects
generally give one an absolutely false idea of the colours. For instance,
had a photograph of the Rufous-tailed Finches appeared in the Magazine
instead of a coloured illustration, many who do not actually know the bird
would be led to suppose that the male possessed a black or very dark mask
instead of the beautiful red face so accurately portrayed by the artist.
Take, for another example, the Gouldian Finch (P. mirabilis) ; we all
know that his head is bright red, his tail-coverts sky blue, his chest blue or
purple and his abdomen 3-ellow. In a photograph he would be represented
with a black head, pure white tail-coverts, his chest nearly white, and his
(d) Mr. Jones' proposition about a cubic foot to eacli bird, if enforced, would put a
stop at once to the importation and sale of all small foreign birds in this country. It is a
good general rule for the aviculturist, but utterly and hopelessly impracticable for the
dealer. -- A. G.B.

abdomen almost black, thus giving an absolutely false idea of the true
markings. Again, the Parrot Finch would appear to be entirely black.
I fear Mr. Hett will be disappointed when he first opens his printing-
frame to see his photo, of a Kingfisher; being a good " sitter " it may be
possible to use " colour sensitive " plates (which require a longer exposure
than ordinary plates) but if not, I fear the brilliant blue of the bird's back
will appear vivid white in the print, and his reddish-brown breast will be
nearly black. However, British birds, as a rule, are not bad subjects for
photography so far as colour is concerned, but unfortunately they do not
much care about being " taken " and are not always good "sitters" (e).
I have not tried to photograph a bird in a cage (I don't like cages),
but in an outdoor aviary I have had fair success with such birds as White-
throated Finches, Jungle Bush Quails, foreign Doves and other soberly-
coloured species.
If such a Club were started as Mr. Hett suggests, I would propose
that it should embrace the photographing of birds and their nests and eggs
in a wild state as well as in captivit}&apos; : it would never do to confine it to
caged birds. D. SeTH-SmiTH.

Mr. Meade-Waldo's interesting article in last month's Avicultural
Magazine has led me to search my memory for cases of unusually old cage-
birds. The following are the only ones worth mentioning which I can call
to mind, and scarcely any of them are very remarkable--they are, indeed,
chiefly noteworthy as negative evidence, and the fadt that the cases of
advanced age within my personal experience are so few and inconspicuous
tends to show that the average life is ver}&apos; short.
In the Avicultural Magazine for November, 1897, a common Barbary
Dove 23 years of age is mentioned. This Dove is still living in the
possession of Colonel Cuthbert Barlow, of Brighton, and is now about 25
years old.
The oldest small passerine bird which I ever saw was a Canary
belonging to my grandfather. This bird was about 16 3&apos;ears old at the time
of its death. It was very tame, and would never settle down for the night
until it had given its master's finger a friendly peck. If this ceremony
were omitted the bird would fidget about for a long time after dark.
I kept a good many Canaries at one time, but I do not recollect
that any of them lived to attain 12 years. In 1S91 I bred from a yellow
cock which I had myself bred in 1882--there were two young ones which
left the nest, but they were very feeble and both died in their nest feathers.
The father had never bred before.
I had an Avadavat for seven years--this bird became partly white in
plumage.
I have a cock Parson Finch which was exhibited at the Crystal
Palace Show in February, 1893, and which must therefore be upwards of six
years old. The beak is overgrown, the plumage very loose, and the whole
appearance of the bird indicative of advanced age.

Sir, --In self-defence I send the following little facts. You will
remember that Mr. Osbaldeston wrote that he had a cock Crimson Finch
that would "clear the deck" of any bird of his own fighting weight.
Unfortunately, just after writing my notes on Crimson Finches, I put a
pair of Blue Bonnets into their aviary--rather anxiously, I confess, for
fear lest the Blue Bonnets should be killed by the Crimson Finches !
Unfortunately, things went the other way, as the cock Blue Bonnet bit the
wing of the cock Crimson Finch and he died.
I at once wrote to Mr. Osbaldeston for his cock just in the hope of
proving my case. I thought if this little savage behaves, surely the Council
will believe me this time. He came late at night and I put him with my
hen. I expedted next morning to find the lady dead and in pieces {vide
members' statements). On the contrary, Othello was all right and so was
poor Desdemona, and they have continued the very best of friends ever
since ; and if the story ends as it should--happily, they intend to rear a
nest of little termagants for the edification of the Society this summer.

In consequence of matters connected with the Society into which it

It is painful to me to sever my official connection with the Society, of
which I am proud to have been one of the founders--but I believe that the
step which I have taken is the right one, both for me and for the Society.
I have now much less spare time than I had when I became Secretary,
and, on the other hand, the work of the Society has increased. I doubt
therefore whether I could, under any circumstances, have continued to hold
the post very much longer.
I wish to express my grateful appreciation of the kindness and

to the Society, and that it will grow and prosper even more in the future
than it has done in the past.

THE BLUE SUGAR-BIRD.
(Dacnis cay ana).
By A. G. Butler, Ph.D.
Our Secretary has asked me to write a short article upon
this beautiful little species ; not because I have ever kept the
bird, but because those who have made the attempt have been so
far unfortunate that they do not feel sufficient confidence in
their treatment to recommend it to others ; whilst, at the same
time, they are too busy to bring together what facts are already
known respecting the species.
The Blue Sugar-bird has a wide range, extending from
Central America in the north, southwards to Bolivia in the west,
and Southern Brazil in the east.
The plate, although a little greener than the bird usually
appears, will give a good idea of the male; the female differs in
its bright green colouring, the head being blue and the throat
ashy; the abdomen is of a yellower green than the upper parts.
Of the wild life of this species very little seems to be
recorded. It is met with in small companies in the open borders
of the forest region and in meadowland studded with scrub.
Judging from its affinities, the nest should be open and cup-
shaped and the eggs spotted.
It is known that Dacnis cayana in its wild state feeds upon
insects and fruit ; therefore, in captivity it ought surely to be
treated precisely in the same way as a Tanager. Mr. Fulljames,
who has had two examples, and who (I believe) was the first to
exhibit the species in this country, fed his specimens upon
banana, sponge-cake, and yolk of egg. Mr. Fillmer, who
succeeded in keeping an example for nine months, fed it upon
banana, milk-sop, and a mixture of dried yolk of egg, sponge-
cake, and ants' eggs.

Dr. Russ speaks of the Blue Sugar-bird as less delicate
than the Yellow-winged Sugar-bird ; he does not say what he
fed it on ; but, for Ccereba, he recommends a mixture of grated
skinned sweet almonds, mixed with crushed biscuits and white
sugar.
It appears to me that there is no possible reason why the
same food which keeps one fruit- and insedl-eater in perfect
health should not be used with equal success in the case of
all ( a ).
For four years I kept a Zosterops in perfect health and
condition on a mixture of bread-crumbs, potato, yolk of egg,
Abrahams' food and ants' cocoons, with orange, sweet-water
grapes split open, over-ripe pear, or sweet apple. On the same
mixture I kept a Superb Tauager in absolutely faultless plumage
and vigorous health, for nineteen months ; and only lost it in
consequence of an epidemic of influenza, which greatly reduced
my collection during the two months in which it raged. I have
already kept two male Scarlet Tanagers for nineteen or twenty
months in perfect health and condition on the same food.
These facts would be sufficient for me; but, at the same
time, as the Cwebidce are somewhat more insectivorous than
Tanagers, I should certainly offer them mealworms ; and, if
they took kindly to this form of insect-food, I should not stint it.
I am well aware that some of our members think me
wholly in the wrong in always recommending the same food for
insectivorous birds, yet it would surely be a greater error to
omit to recommend that which I have found most satisfactory.
For ten years I have fed an American Blue-bird upon it, and he
is still full of vigour ; for ten years a Liothrix had nothing else
(excepting seed, of which he swallowed his full share); for over
five years I have kept a Blackbird in perfect health upon this
mixture, and he is as full of song as ever. It may not suit a
Nightingale ; yet I have kept that bird twice as long upon it as
upon the yolk-of-egg + ants' cocoons -j- mealworm diet, and at
about a tenth the cost. In my opinion, therefore, this food
deserves a fair and impartial trial in the case of Sugar-birds.

By W. H. St. Quintin.
I do not know if there is at the present time anybody
beside mj^self in this country who has tame Eiders. If so, I am
unaware of the fact, though I have often made enquiries of
persons who might be likely to know if this were the case. They
have not, I think, been kept at the Zoological Gardens of late
years ; though at one time, I believe about fifty years ago, they
were bred there.
My first pair of Eiders were sent to me by an Orkney
fisherman, who managed to rear a duck and a drake with con-
siderable trouble--the young birds not taking any food that was
offered to them except earthworms.
I found great difficulty at first in arriving at the best diet
suited to these birds in captivity ; but after many trials came to
the conclusion that barley meal, mixed with Spratt's poultry
meal, moistened so as to form large pelletts, or balls, with a small
quantity of fresh Ox- or Rabbit-liver daily, w 7 as sufficient to
keep the birds in the best of health, when once they were
accustomed to it.
For the first few weeks the young should have earth-
worms ; indeed they will look at nothing else, but by degrees
they can be trained to the same diet that answers for the adults.
I should add that the old birds will eat bread freely and, when
very hungry, grain as well.
A fox killed my old drake after I had kept him nine years ;
and his mate died, apparently of old age, two years later.
At present I have two fine drakes--one a descendant of the
original pair--the other drake and three ducks having been
hatched from eggs sent to me from Northumberland. There is
also a young duck, the survivor of three ducklings hatched last
year.
The young are by no means easily reared. Besides rats,
the greatest enemies to young ducklings that I know of,
exposure to hot sun will often bring on attacks of heat-apoplexy.
I lost two fine young birds last summer from this cause, when
they were of the size of a Teal. The young birds moreover often
go off in a sort of decline after getting fully feathered ; and- in
short they are not easy subjects to manage. But still to my
mind they are worth a good deal of trouble. Their extreme
tameness, the wild "cooing" of the drakes in the spring, and

<bodyText confidence="0.99903624137931" page_id="32638487"  page_num="Page 116" year="" vol="">
their quaint ways in the courting season, make them very
interesting pets. The drakes go into a very complete eclipse as
soon as the ducks begin to sit. The pistachio green patch on the
nape, the cream white breast, and the snowy neck and scapulars
all being exchanged for a suit of sables. But almost as soon as
the summer plumage is completed the change begins again, and
white feathers begin to show here and there, and the complete
black dress is worn for a very short period. Of course the above
moults only affect the body feathers ; the flights and tail being
shed in the autumn only. It is wonderful how rapidly these
feathers are thrown. If the birds are in good condition, they will
cast all their flights in twenty-four hours, and they are very
quickly regained.
Unlike the other Diving Ducks, Eiders use their wings
vigorously when diving, to force themselves under, and to guide
themselves when beneath the surface.
All my Eider Ducks, while incubating, have sat steadily
through the whole twenty-eight days without coming off. I used
to be much concerned about my first old duck, when she
remained on her nest so long ; and I used to provide her with
food and water within her reach, until I was satisfied that she
never touched them. She became quite grown over by a mass
of chickweed in the bed of pampas grass in which she annually
made her nest.
I do not know if in the wild state Eiders are an exception
to the rule prevailing amongst other incubating ducks, of coming
off once in the twenty-four hours to wash and feed. It might
easily be ascertained at the Fame Islands for instance. If it is
so, it seems hard to account for the habit.

MIMICRY BY BIRDS IN A WILD STATE.

It has often seemed to me an interesting question how far
birds, which in captivity become imitative, are so in a wild state.
Probably some members of the Society have sojourned in the
lands of Parrots and Parrakeets, and might give us instances of
their exercising their powers of mimicry without being induced
to do so by the associations of captivity. There are, however,
enough potential mimics among our own birds for it to be worth
while noting instances, and I fancy that far more species of
British birds have these imitative powers than are generally
credited with them. Two undoubted instances are within my
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.981715217391304" page_id="32638488"  page_num="Page 117" year="" vol="">
personal knowledge of late years, which may be worth recording,
the first of a Starling, the second of a Blackbird.
1. I have in my grounds a large and very fine Scotch fir,
almost entirely covered with dense masses of ivy ; Mr. Ruskin
once wrote that a Scotch fir so clad is one of the most beautiful
objedts in Nature. Certainly this tree was, at the time of which
I write, most beautiful, with immense tapering racemes of ivy
drooping down towards a pool. It is less so now, for though the
ivy near the stem seems ever to thicken, the lower drooping
boughs have died.
It is the home of innumerable birds, chiefly Starlings.
Now-a-days my Bankiva Jungle hens insist upon making their
nests in the abysses of the ivy, sometimes at the very top, which
must be quite a hundred feet high. Javanese Peafowls, too, often
roost on the boughs, but do not seem at all to overawe the
smaller fry. One evening, above the hubbub of probably
hundreds of voices at roosting-time, I heard the distinct " come
bock" of a hen Guinea-fowl. I then possessed no Guinea-fowl,
but suspected that some might have been surreptitiously
introduced at a cottage near, where I did not allow Poultry
to be kept. Another evening, one of my men distinctly heard
the supposed Guinea-fowl. It turned out to be a Starling, which
for some months frequented the tree, and treated us to music
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.673115666666667">
which doubtless it had picked up at a farm where Guinea-fowl
were kept.
2. The second instance is a much more striking one--
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.992373333333333" page_id="32638488"  page_num="Page 117" year="" vol="">
that of a wild Blackbird which imitates a postman's whistle. In
the countrified region where I live, post offices are far apart ;
and so the postman blows a whistle as he drives along the road,
and letters are taken at or brought out from many cottage-gates.
His whistle is very prolonged and very shrill. Early last year
(I think in February) the well-known whistle was heard, once or
twice, hours before the proper time. Everyone was puzzled ;
then it was traced to a hamlet about a quarter of a mile from my
gate. I heard it several times myself, and thought it the work
of a mischievous boy who ought to be suppressed. It became
more frequent, and after some days one of my servants assured
me that the whistler was a bird. This I realty did not at first
believe, but was soon convinced. The whistler was, and I am
glad to say is, a singularly beautiful Blackbird, who day by day
whistled more strongly, generally from an apple tree in my
grounds. His voice, nearly always heard from above (for he
haunts a valley) sounds much farther off than it is ; as the
season advanced, he continually began his long whistle and then
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.941786136363637" page_id="32638489"  page_num="Page 118" year="" vol="">
broke off into his natural song. Then, when the season of song
p issecl, he was silent and it was feared that he had come to grief.
However, he is again in his old haunts and again whistles daily,
but hardly with the force of last year. He has only begun in
April, instead of much earlier, and so possibly his voice may
gain strength. I should be interested to know if any of our
members are acquainted with similar instances. I may say that
the postman comes from six or seven miles distance, and passes
rapidly: which makes it more remarkable that the bird should
have acquired such perfect imitation of his whistle (jb).
3. I cannot help alluding here to the curious similarity
between the notes of the Cuckoo .and of an Australian Dove
( Geopelia humeralis). I do not do so as the least a propos of
these instances of imitation ; of course there is no mimicry
whatever here, simply a curious similarity, of which evidently
the birds of two very dissimilar races are conscious. I had for
seven years a peculiarly tame cock of this species of Dove,
variously called " Bronze-necked " and " Barred-shouldered."
He would latterly, almost to order, cuckoo for my headman, and
generally for me. The Cuckoos were evidently taken in, and
used to fly close to his aviary. One spring, the usual accounts of
a wonderfully early Cuckoo being heard, this time in Hereford-
shire, appeared in some of the London papers ; they were
quotations from a Herefordshire newspaper. I enquired the
authority, and was informed that some masons, restoring a
church, had frequently and distinctly heard the Cuckoo on a hill
in my grounds. It was, of course, the Dove, whose voice from
his aviary on high ground was heard more than half a mile
away as the crow flies, across the Wye. Since the demise of this
favourite last autumn, his widow has begun to cuckoo, which she
rarely, if ever, did before. Yesterday (April 16th) I happened
to be close to her aviary, when, far below in the valley, I heard,
for the first time this year, the notes of the veritable Cuckoo--
she immediately answered, crying " cuckoo " twice. There is, I
believe, an old superstition that the chief occupation of the )^ear
is to be that which is the occupation when one hears the
Cuckoo for the first time. I hope aviculturists will not deem the
prospect of my year to be very unprofitable when I say that I
was making a Sabbatical tour round many aviaries !
(b) I have not the least doubt that this whistle was learnt by a young- bird when
learning its parent's song, of which the nestling considered it a part. In like manner
there is a Blackbird here, born in my front garden about two years ago, which picked up,
as part of its performance, the first stanza of a well-known air (probably Irish) which a
Parrot next door constantly repeated.-- A. G. B.

THE WAXWING AND THE PERSIAN BULBUL.

Sir,-- May I ask what is the correct food for, and treatment of, the
Bohemian Waxwing in confinement, and if it is not a very hardy bird, more
suited to outdoor than indoor life ?
Also food and treatment of the Persian Bulbul, and what are the
distinguishing features by which the real singing one may be identified ?
I think I remember reading somewhere an article by Dr. Butler, in which
he stated either that the Persian variety was the only one possessing a
sweet song, or that there were two varieties of Persian, one much superior
to the otlieju
A. A. Pearson.
The following answer has been sent to Mr. Pearson :
The Waxwing should be fed upon hips and haws, all kinds of small
fruits ; soft food, consisting of breadcrumbs two parts, potato boiled at
least one day previous!)&apos; one part, ants' cocoons and yolk of egg, of each
one part ; also liemp-seed and mealworms or other insects.
Waxwings are very thirsty and therefore dirty birds ; they seldom or
never wash, and require a large cage and much attention to keep them clean
and in health.
The Persian Bulbul is the most musical and charming of all birds of
the genus Pycnonotus &quot;, but its Western Indian race is very inferior, is smaller
and sings rather poorly.
The true Persian bird is of about the same size as the Red-vented
Bulbul. The staple food should consist of breadcrumbs, ants 1 cocoons and
yolk of egg moistened either with potato or grated carrot; but fruit should
be given daily and young lettuce chopped up, when obtainable ; also meal-
worms and other grubs, or spiders.

out of doors ? Any information on the subject will oblige.

The following reply was sent to Mr. Goddard.
I should advise your adding bread, soaked in warm water, to the
canary and hempseed you are giving your Parrakeets (of course, in a
separate tin). Add millet, if you like, and some pea-nuts.
I would not put them out until the end of May, at the earliest; and,
for this year, I would take them in again towards the end of August. Next
year you might put them out rather earlier, and leave them out altogether.

Sir,--T here was so little response to Mr. Meade-Waldo's suggestion
to communicate cases of longevity of birds in confinement, that I venture
to send some of mine, though I did not deem them of sufficient interest
until I found there was only one other communication, and that your own.
Last month there died, in my aviary, a little cock Cockatiel, which I
bred in my aviary nineteen years ago next month (May). Until last year
he always went by the name of "young Joey," in order to distinguish him
from his father, who was then killed, I regret to say, by another Parrakeet.
In January, 1880, I bought him from a lady who wrote that she "was
pleased her old Joey was going to a good home." So if he were " old " then
there is no saying how old he was when he died.
I have at present in the aviary a common Red-billed Weaver, which
I brought with me from my old home in Lincolnshire, eleven years ago
this month ; I do not know how long I had had him then, but not more
than a year or two.
(c) I do not think any aviculturist is likely to object to this. I am always glad to let
anyone who is interested in birds see my aviaries, provided I am there to receive them :
naturally it is not desirable that strangers should walk in on a tour of inspection in the
absence of the owner.--A. G. B.

I had a pair of Blue Robins eight years, when the hen died ; she
looked very old when she was sent to me, but she nested freely for some
years. The cock I then considerately gave to a friend : he was such a
murderer ! And in the third year after that, he succumbed himself to the
fate he had visited on so many.
I have lately lost a Red Rosella, which had lived four-and-a-half years
in the aviary without his upper mandible. This, I think, is an interesting
record. Five years ago this spring, he had the upper mandible torn out in
a fight with a Bulla Bulla. How he contrived to live I never knew, as he was
not fed by a mate or any other bird; but I think bread-aud-milk sop--a
saucerful of which is daily supplied to the aviary--formed his chief diet.
He used also to spend a lot of time " nuzzling " about in the liempseed, and
I believe he was picking up chipped seed which other birds had cracked and
wasted. He seemed quite happy, and the only difficulty he appeared to
labour under was his inability to free his new feathers from their sheath in
moulting-time, which gave him a very peculiar appearance, and must have
been very uncomfortable. I had had him about ten years when he died.
I have only kept the larger Parrots for eleven years, so have no
instances of longevity to record among them, at present.
E. A. H. Hartley.
Sir.--I do not know if the longevity of my birds is anything remark-
able. I have had a Virginian Cardinal since December, 1885, and he is still
in very good plumage, though his singing powers have lessened, and his
feet show signs of old age in loss of claws. He is one of the tamest birds I
have ever had, and will sing to me or any of his two or three special friends
" by desire," like a Piping Bullfinch. He puts up his crest and flutters his
wings directly I begin to talk to him, and then starts whistling in a soft
subdued key, quite different from his independent song. He is rewarded
with a few liempseeds. Often he calls me to him if I have been absent
for a short time, and will continue to sing as long as I talk to him and
praise him. He was very wild when I first had him, but soon became tame.
I have also had an Orange Bishop for ten years, and a Pileated Finch
for seven years. This bird has such an antipathy to Aurora Finches that I
have had to give up keeping them. I hoped, after the lapse of a year, that
the Pileated Finch would have forgotten his animosity; but directly I put
a new pair of Auroras into my aviary-cage he flew at them most viciously.
He never molests any other birds. When angry, he erects his beautiful
crimson crest and attempts to " sing " after his own fashion--for it cannot
be called a song, the notes are harsh and shrill.
I omitted to say that my Cardinal used frequently to sing during the
night in his younger days.

forehead and shoulder-tips are a fairly bright blue. It is in perfect feather,
and verj- lively. It thrives on the same food as my Superb and Violet
Tanagers and my Zosterops--Mr. Abrahams' Insectivorous Food, preserved
egg and potato, and a constant supply of fruit. It will take mealworms
from my hand, but soon drops them.
C. A. Hodgson.
Tha following reply was sent to Miss Hodgson :
Your specimen of Dacnis cayana is a cock, and will no doubt become
still bluer and brighter. The cocks seem usually out of colour when
imported. It may be that they are young birds, but I think that it is
equally probable that the species goes through a seasonal change of
plumage, which is certainly the case with Ccereba cyanea. My bird would
not touch mealworms, nor any insects which I offered it, and I doubt
whether it ate the ants' eggs in its food. It is unwise to deduce too much
from the behaviour of a single specimen, but my experience of this bird
has led me to have grave doubts as to whether the species is in any proper
sense insectivorous, though it may eat insects occasionally (as even
Waxbills will), (d) From its great liking for honey, I should infer that it
feeds largely on the nedtar of flowers.

THE BUIE-BEARDED JAY.
Sir, --I should be glad if you would be good enough to give me a little
information about a bird I have. The dealer called it an Australian Blue-
eared Jay. It is rather larger than a Blackbird. The top of its head is
black, with a black crest, a black bib-like patch over the chest, white breast
and abdomen, black wings and tail, end of tail-feathers white ; small bright
blue patch over the eyes, and larger one underneath ; just behind the crest
and between the shoulders is a pale blue-grey patch, rest of back black ;
beak black, long and rather pointed ; legs and feet blackish, nail of hinder
toe long and curved. Eyes in front of its head, bright and piercing, pupils
black, iris yellow.
I am feeding him with " softbilo " and mealworms. He seems likely
to be easily tamed, as I have only had him two days and he will take
mealworms from my fingers already.
R. M. Barber.
The following reply was sent to Airs. Barber :
Your bird is undoubtedly the Blue-bearded Jay (a South American
species). I have had an example for more than four years : it is alwa) - s in
perfect health, and, excepting when moulting, in perfect plumage. It is
very fond of having its head scratched and its sides tickled. I believe that
all the American Jays are very tame and confiding birds.

species.--E d.

Sir, --With regard to the questions you ask in reference to the above
subject, I think the cost of the annual license should not be less than 21/-
for catchers and dealers, and that the foreign bird agents should be licensed
as well as the dealers.
A dealer should be defined thus, I think : Anyone who buys birds
wholesale to sell in a shop, also anyone who hawks birds round from door
to door to sell again, and any amateur who catches birds to sell again should
pa}- catcher's license and dealer's license.
With reference to giving reasonable space for birds, I think catchers
and dealers should be compelled to give space according to the size of the
bird. For instance: birds 6 inches and under, from tip of beak to end of
tail, should be given by the catcher and dealer 6 cubic inches of space each
when crowded together, and 12 cubic inches when in the hands of customers ;
and birds between 6 and 9 inches long, 9 cubic inches of space when caged
together by catcher and dealer, or 18 cubic inches when in the hands of a
customer. If this were done, cage-makers would be compelled to make
their cages the right dimensions, otherwise they would be unsaleable.
Arthur Jones.
Sir, --If the bird-protection leagues believe that any good is being
done by all the restrictions that they are putting upon the liberty of
Englishmen, let them at least not over-reach themselves by ludicrous
severity. Let a license be imposed upon professional catchers if they like,
and, while they are about it, let it be #50 a year : it will be no more pro-
hibitive than a guinea. As to imposing a license upon private persons, that
is all nonsense : who can decide whether the owner intends to keep his

interfere with dealers is to put a stop to aviculture : that is my view of the
case.

By D. Seth-Smith, F.Z.S.
In June of last year (1898) Mr. Swaysland, of Brighton,,
imported a fine pair of this species, which soon came into the
possession of the present writer. They were placed in an
outdoor aviary with numerous other birds, where, for two or
three months, they appeared to thrive and do well, and
occasionally were seen carrying about small pieces of various
substances, which had been supplied as building material for
any of the birds that cared to make use of it. The cock, in full
summer dress of lemon-yellow and black, was one of the most
conspicuous birds in the aviary, and his merry song, uttered
throughout the greater part of the day, was most pleasing.
During the latter part of the summer the writer was
obliged to be away from home for months together, and the care
of the birds was entrusted to others: a course seldom satisfactory
although often unavoidable. One day both birds were found dead
upon the floor ; and their skins being valued too highly for the
bodies to be sent away for post mortem examination, the exact
cause of death was never ascertained.
Although the pair above referred to lived but a short time
(fortunately long enough for our artist to obtain a most charming
and life-like drawing of them) it is probable that this, the so-
called American Goldfinch, might live for a long time in
captivity if properly treated ; but it cannot be regarded as a
very hardy species. As to food, it requires a variety of seed to
keep it in health : probably the same treatment as is usually
adopted in the case of our British Goldfinch and Siskin would
generally be found to succeed with their American cousin :
such seeds as thistle, linseed, hemp, rape, and canan aid be

supplied, with plenty of green food, such as flowering groundsel,
chickweed, etc.
Having had but a limited experience of this beautiful
species, the writer may perhaps be forgiven for quoting some-
what fully from Mr. Henry Nearling's delightful book on
American birds, entitled " Our Native Birds of Song and
Beauty." Such a charming account of this species is therein
given that it cannot fail to interest our members. He writes--
"In the merry month of June we hear from early dawn till the
evening falls a chorus of beautiful singing birds. The Oriole in
the elm, the Song-sparrow in the rose-bushes, the Catbird in the
honeysuckle, the Summer Warbler in the mock orange, the
Rose-breasted Grosbeak in the trees of the woodland border,
the Veery in the mossy swamp, the Bobolink in the flower-
adorned meadow, the Red-wing in the reeds, the Martin in the
air--all sing in jubilant notes their hymns of joy and happiness.
Not earlier than the latter part of the month our lovely little
Goldfinch begins to join the chorus, and by July first all the
males are in full song. Their brilliant, melodious, and liquid
strains are now heard from all sides. Almost all other birds are
now busily engaged in feeding their young, finding rarely time
for singing, except in the dusk of the evening.
" The Goldfinch, which is also known by the names of Wild
Canary, Thistle-bird, Yellow-bird, and Lettuce-bird (a), is one
of our most familiar species, being especially abundant in settled
localities. Its colours are gay, its song sweet and varied, its
ways and manners agreeable, innocent, and enjoyable, and its
nesting-habits and its family-life highly interesting. It is,
therefore, quite worthy of the love and favour with which it
is regarded by all who love nature."
Farther on, the same writer observes, " In Wisconsin, I
have rarely met with the first arrivals from the South before
May 15th, and sometimes I have not seen them before May 25th.
They usually make their appearance in large scattered flocks,
which remain together until the breeding-season arrives, when
they separate into pairs--this is about the middle of June."
It is interesting to read an American writer's opinion of
the species as a cage-bird ; he says, "As soon as the young are
able to leave the nest, they are placed in a cage, and the old
birds feed them until they are able to provide for themselves.
Then they are taken into the house and fed like Canaries--with
(a) It is, however, a true Siskin, and the name by which it is known in England,
and which has been chosen for the heading of this paper, is the most appropriate.--D.S.-S.

a mixture of rape and canary-seed and, now and then, a few
hempseeds. I know a Goldfinch that lived in captivity for
thirteen; and another for fifteen, years. . . . The old birds
rarely live longer than a year in a cage, and most of them die in
the course of the first summer or in fall. In the cage, our
beautiful Goldfinch proves to be rather a delicate bird, and it
takes careful nursing in order to succeed with it. It shows a
ver}^ varied taste in regard to its favourite kinds of seed. The
best food consists of a selection of the following seeds : Canary,
flax, rape, oat-grits, hemp, and lettuce-seed, generally diminish-
ing in favour in the order named."
In full summer dress the male is pure lemon-yellow,
rather more dingy on the mantle ; greater wing-coverts, bastard
wing, quills and primary coverts black edged with white towards
the tips and round the ends. Tail feathers black with a white
spot at the tip of each, and the centre ones broadty edged with
white on the inner web. Upper tail coverts white. Bill orange,
feet yellowish-brown.
In winter plumage the male resembles the female, except
that the wings and tail are blacker with the white markings
more distindt.
The adult female, in summer, is olive-brown tinged with
olive-greenish above ; under parts yellowish-white tinged with
grey. Upper tail-coverts greyish-white. Wings and tail dusky-
black, marked with white as in the male. In the winter the
female becomes somewhat browner.
According to Ridgway, the young are like the adults in
winter plumage bur much browner, the wing markings light
cinnamon and the plumage generally suffused with this colour.
" Nest a very neat cup-shaped structure, composed of
compactly-woven plant-fibres, etc., lined with plant-down and
other soft materials, placed in tall bushes or low trees. Eggs
3-5, -66 x -47, plain pale bluish or bluish white."
The species is said to be resident in the whole of temperate
North America, although a partial migration undoubtedly takes
place in the Spring and Autumn.

Our Secretary has reminded me that I have not written
any Parrot Notes for the last number, so I again take up my
pen.
Before beginning, I should like to correct a printer's
error in 1113^ last " Note." My answer about the uncertainty
of Pomeranian dogs' tempers was not " Not all," but " Not at
all," i.e., Poms, are certain bad, or certain good, tempers. You
always know where you are with a Pom., which is exactly what
you do not with an Amazon, as a rule.
However, to go on with the Amazons. Having done with
the "Golden-nape" and the "Double-fronted," the turn of the
Common Amazon comes next. This is the " Blue-fronted " or
Chrysotis cestiva. Few Parrots are so common : few can be
better known. As to the plumage, there is 110 Parrot so diverse.
Many other species of Parrot show hardly any difference between
one specimen and another. The person who feeds them may
know one Pennant or one Blue Mountain from another; but to
the casual observer they must be absolutety alike. Now, the
difference between two Blue-fronted Amazons can be detected by
the most indifferent onlooker. Some have very little yellow on
the throat, some a great deal. No Parrot is so often variegated,,
or throws out so mail}&apos;of what the dealers call "King" birds.
And very few Parrots are so handsome as a well-variegated Blue-
fronted Amazon. I saw last year, at Pring's shop, a beautiful
bird with both wings entirety light }^ellow. It might have been
shown as an " evenly marked " bird. Whoever may have been
the purchaser could hardly have got a handsomer bird.
But though the Blue-fronted Amazon is a very hardy bird,
and generalty very tame, I am not inclined to class it, as a
rule, as a first-rate talker. It learns to sa)^ a few things easily::
it learns to sing more easily than a Grey, but it is fonder of
imitating sounds than words. It can give an admirable imitation
of a conversation of which 3^011 cannot make out the words. It
laughs better than any Grey: it goes into fits of laughter,,
in which you cannot help joining, so great an effedt of merriment
do they produce. It can be trained to fly loose much more
easity than a Gre3 r , because all the Amazons have much greater

wing-power in proportion to their weight. An Amazon, on being
first turned out, has no difficulty in flying a few yards and then
stopping. A Grey Parrot, when first turned out, flies until it
drops from exhaustion, so that you may have some difficulty in
finding it, and it has to be out two or three days before it can
be sure of settling where it wants to settle. Amazons, too, never
fly far away, so that if an aviculturist can find a spot free
from boys, and where he can make friends with the keeper, he
may turn out Amazons with but little risk.
I do not think that, if I were goingto buy a talking Parrot,
I should seledt a Blue-fronted Amazon ; but if I were going to
buy one, I should choose a thick-set compact bird, which was
tame, and could say a few words. Amazons are not, like Greys,
silent before strangers : they are quite ready to talk to them. I
know of no means of distinguishing sex, but I should choose a
bird with plenty of yellow about the head. After all, a Parrot's
powers of talking generally depend a good deal on its possessor's
imagination, and, if the would-be purchaser has a lively imagi-
nation, I daresay a Blue-fronted would say as wonderful things
as any other Parrot.
With the Blue-fronted, I would class C. oclirocephala, the
Yellow-fronted, and C. festiva, the Festive Amazon. Both these
are given in the British Museum Catalogue as 14-5 inches in
length, and they seem to me of the same size as the Blue-fronted.
The Yellow-fronted is known by its having a round yellow
spot on its forehead, while its beak is horn-colour with a reddish
spot in the middle. I am not very fond of this species, and I
doubt if the hen bird talks--I might almost say--at all. The
cock bird seems to me to be more uncertain in its temper, and
more jealous than the other Amazons--and it is noisy. Still, I
think the cock bird talks quite as much as the Blue-fronted, and
is not a bad talker. I fancy the cocks have a larger yellow patch
than the hens : if I were buying one, I would only buy one with
a large 3^ellow patch, unless I knew the bird was a good talker.
The Festive Amazon seems to me a more attractive bird.
My own experience has been unfavourable, but only two passed
through my hands. Neither of those were tame or talked ; but
Dr. Greene had one which he told me was very clever and picked
up words very easily. I saw one at Havre which rather tempted
me. It was very tame and said a few words readily ; but I did
not buy it, because it had something the matter with one eye.
According to the Brit. Mus. Catalogue there are two other
Amazons rather like it-- C. bodini and C. chloronota. I have
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.999185441860465" page_id="32638503"  page_num="Page 130" year="" vol="">
never seen either, and should therefore say the Festive is un-
niistakeable. It is all green on the back, with a ridge of brown
feathers across the beak and a bright red rump. It is this bri ght
red patch (which causes the French to call it l'Amazone a dos
rouge) which makes it so very unmistakeable. I observe that
Russ gives it a poor character as a talker, but I suspect that it is
a question of sex: that the birds I had, and the birds he saw,
were hens, while Dr. Greene's bird was probably a cock. As I
have as little idea how the sexes may be distinguished, as I have
how to tell the cock Blue-fronted from the hen, 1 can only r say
that I would not buy a Festive unless I knew it could talk. But
if an aviculturist should come across one which was tame, gentle
and talked, he probably' might buy many a worse Parrot as a
talking pet.
I forgot, I had a third Festive. It was a bird all yellow,
belonging to a man in a Midland County. I had it on approval
as a marvellous talker, and a talker in many languages. It was
very vicions, and never said a word. I wrote to the man, but
could get no answer. At last I found he was in gaol. I was
rather puzzled what to do. Had the bird been attractive, or
even decently^ civil,I would havekeptit until the man re-appeared.
But a thoroughly^ vicious bird ? No ! (By-the-wayq none of
these three birds ever screamed or made any noise in particular).
At last I handed it to the police, and let them settle the matter.
This bird may have been a cock, because it was good-tempered
with women.
Many other Amazons are about the same size as these
three, to wit, Dufresne's, the Green-cheeked, pretrei, lilacina ,
diademcita, finschi, autumnalis, panamensis . but as I have never
had any of them, or known anyone who has kept them as
pets, and as these notes purport to tell my experiences, I say r
nothing about them, and shall pass on to a smaller size of
Amazon still.
I wall take these smaller ones in the order in which they r
come in the British Museum Catalogue, and, as they^ are less
common than the ones I have hitherto described, it may be
convenient to those who have not the Catalogue by T them, if I
describe them.
First of all comes Chrysotis vittata. A specimen was
exhibited at the Show held at the Crystal Palace in Odtober, and
there was a specimen the other day at the Zoological Gardens.
It was so like the one at the Palace that it may have been the-
same. Both were very excited when one talked to them, and
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.983026372093024" page_id="32638504"  page_num="Page 131" year="" vol="">
bustled up to one with rather angry intentions. But it is a
pretty little bird. Length about 12 inches, instead of the 14/5 to
which the Yellow-fronted Amazon runs. It is green, with the
edges of the feathers black, under surface lighter green, a
narrow red band on the forehead. The Catalogue says the skin
round the eyes is whitish ; but, if I recoiled! right, these two had
white feathers round the eyes too. There are blue feathers in
the wing. Like so many Amazons, the green tail-feathers have
yellowish tips, and red at the base of the inner web of the side
ones ; the bill is yellowish. The Catalogue says some specimens
have no red at the base of the inner web of the lateral tail-
feathers. Perhaps these are young ones. It seemed to me a
noisy little bird, and certainly not friendly to the general public.
I see that I have missed out Chrysotis amazonicci, which is
rather a large bird, as its length runs to i3&apos;5 inches. The
Catalogue description says : " Green, under surface paler ; the
feathers of the hind neck edged with blackish. Forehead and
eyebrows blue, vertex pale yellow, cheeks deep yellow, ear
coverts grass green, bill light horn-colour. I leave out a
description of that part of the plumage which is not so striking,
and merely add that what is usually red in the wings of most
Amazons is, in C. amazonicci, orange, whence its English name of
" the Orange-winged Amazon."
The only amazonica I had was one that was advertised
for #\, as a very accomplished bird. It came and was quite
tame, but after I had it a fortnight without its ever saying even
" Polly," I returned it. I have never seen a talking one, and
the species appear to me less clever than many of the smaller
kinds.
C. albifrons I have not kept, and those specimens I have
seen had nothing particular to recommend them as pets.
C. xantholora I have not kept, but it is the pi-ettiest of the
small Amazons. I have never seen it in a bird-shop, so it is.
hardly worth while describing it.
There remain C. collaria and C. leucocepliala. These two
are probably local varieties of the same species : leucocepliala
being the form found in the Island of Cuba, and collaria in
Jamaica. They are about 13 inches long, and may be all three
known by a white beak ; the feathers being heavily edged with
black, the forehead white, and the cheeks and throat rosy-red..
This bird makes a very friendly little pet. Many of them
learn to speak several words. They were imported in old days
much more frequently than they are now. Whether they have

been destroyed, or whether they are not worth exporting, I do
not know : but I have come across them in the hands of private
persons, and not in bird-shops. I would much rather buy one
of these than a Blue-fronted, all other points being equal, but I
fear they are somewhat noisy. At present they are so seldom
met with that I should certainly advise any aviculturist who had
one offered him at a reasonable price, and had room--how often
one&apos;s purchases are stopped by want of that, even as much as of
money !--to buy it; he could always dispose of it, unless it was
wilder than any I have yet seen.
And so end my "Notes" on Amazons. I wish that
aviculturists who have kept any Amazons would take the trouble
to corredt my experiences and record theirs.

NOTES ON MY SHAMAH.

<bodyText confidence="0.983859538461539" page_id="32638505"  page_num="Page 132" year="" vol="">
By Rosie Alderson.
When I first purchased my cock Shamah, rather more
than a year ago, his plumage was very ragged and the tip of his
upper mandible was broken off. His beak quickly grew again,
and he is now in lovely feather and song. Since I bought him
he has never had a day's illness, so perhaps these few notes on
his diet may be of some interest to any member who is thinking
of keeping one of these delightful pets.
Every day in the morning "Phil" has a mixture of
bought insectivorous food, (I think it is only fair to the maker to
give his name--Mr. Arthur, of Melksham), and grated carrot ;
the latter carefully washed, and peeled thinly if the outside is at
all hard. During the first few months I tried crumbled sponge
cake moistened, as a foundation, but lound the carrot better. In
the afternoon, a few cleaned ants' eggs, soaked in warm water
and strained. Of course, if the weather is hot, all the old food
left from the morning is taken away before it turns sour.
In addition to these, the staple articles of diet, "Phil" has
a variety of live insects that he greatly appreciates. Woodlice
can generally be found under old stones in rockeries, and, even
so early in the summer as this, an abundance of green aphides
can be brushed from the young rose shoots. We are the fortunate
possessors of a large garden, in one part of which, in summer, is
a long row of dahlias. On the stakes of these I place inverted
flower-pots half filled with crumpled brown paper, and these
shaken out every morning ydeld a rich harvest of scores of ear-

wigs. They may also be caught by paper being placed in the
\0x25A0same manner among the branches of wall-fruit-trees.
Our friends are very good in providing us with house
beetles--for " Phil " is a great favourite--and these, I think, are
his chief, delight. If a " demon " beetle trap is brought into the
room he flutters wildly with excitement, and the moment his
*cage door is opened darts down on the trap, his head and
shoulders disappearing inside, and he emerges in triumph with
a struggling beetle. It is to be hoped that the poor thing cannot
feel, for it is tossed about, and the legs and perhaps the head
torn off before the remaining portion is swallowed--this cruel
treatment is only reserved for the larger beetles, the smaller ones
are eaten whole. If the hapless victim makes an attempt to get
away, " Phil " enjoys it all the more : he will let it run a little
way and then, jumping after it, will seize it again like a cat
playing with a mouse. I must not forget to add to his menu a
few mealworms daily, and occasionally a moth (particularly one
with a good deal of down on it), makes a welcome change.
" Phil" is a most affectionate and sociable bird, and quite
mopes if no one is sitting in the room with him, though with
strangers he is very nervous. He delights in having a fly out of
his cage, and will frequently fly on to my head or my shoulder,
and if I am sewing, and do not pay him sufficient attention, he will
steal my thread-ends out of pure revenge, and possibly eat one
or two before they can be taken from him. He has only one
trick, and perhaps it hardly deserves the name. I often carry in
my pocket (much to the horror of some of my friends) a small
tin pill box full of mealworms, for, in my journeys down to my
bird-house, which is some distance from the house, I am followed
by many small petitioners--wild Robins and Chaffinches which
I have tamed. I may just mention, in passing, that one Robin,
" Bob," has scarcely missed being fed a single day for nearly
three years. He follows me all over the garden, and will fly
down from the highest tree when called, and feed from my hand.
" Phil" knows this mealworm-box quite well, and when I bring
it out and say " Two for a worm," he will fly on my hand and
give two sharp peeks at the box-lid, which is his "Open sesame!"
Ret me advise anyone who thinks of keeping a pair of
Shamahs to get both at the same time, or not to make a pet of
one before getting the other. A short time ago, thinking to give
\0x25A0" Phil" great pleasure, I purchased a hen. She is a nice gentle
little bird, but at present in very rough plumage. When she
was first brought into the room " Phil " did not take much

notice of her, and, though his cage-door was open, he did not
seem to care to come out, but the moment I thoughtlessly gave
her a mealworm all his jealous instincts were aroused. He
dashed out, and with many angry " clucks " flew straight at her
cage with outstretched wings and uplifted tail, and tried to kill
her through the wires. As the hen did not seem very frightened
I kept her in the room for some time, but " Phil " refused to be
pacified, and repeated his assaults again and again. After I had
taken his rival away, it was most amusing to see how he put on all
his most winning ways to make us notice him and beg forgive-
ness; but we felt it our duty&quot; for a time to treat him with severity r
as a punishment for his unkind conduct. He tolerates his wife
better now, but I dare not put them into one cage, for if I take
any 7 notice of her, or give her anything, he gets excited at once.
I think " Phil " could easily 7 be taught to whistle tunes :
he can sing the first few bars from the drawing-room music out
of "Utopia" very 7 correctly 7 . Besides his ordinary 7 song he has
two other notes -- a loud " cluck, cluck ! " when vexed or
frightened, and a plaintive noise like a kitten mewing, when he
is getting discontented and wants someone to notice him.
In conclusion, I must not forget to add that he delights
in a daily bath of cold water (the chill taken off in winter) the
first thing every morning, and on hot day 7 s his cage is carried
into the garden where lie revels in a sun-bath, lying flat on his
cage-floor with outstretched wings.

Sir, --The question has occurred to me, Has a bird any control over
the time at which it assumes bright plumage ? I am inclined to think not,
yet it evidently contrives to make the bright feathers show as much as
possible as soon as they begin to come, and to hide the dull ones as long as
it can. Perhaps some of our members have studied the subject.
I have a Madagascar Weaver which began to grow scarlet in
November, but after a few weeks, and when a very long way off full colour,
it went brown again very quickly. It has now assumed the brilliant
plumage and almost completed it.
A Rufous-necked Weaver, a few weeks since, went into dull plumage
(though they live together in an outdoor aviary) and another Rufous-necked
Weaver has remained in bright plumage for three years.
A Nonpareil, living with them, has been dull all the winter, but, I
think, begins to show signs of brightening now.
Have breeders of these birds which have bright and dull times of
plumage found that they gradually begin to assume bright plumage in our
springtime after a few generations ?

Sir,&apos; --According to Dr. Butler, the Society for the Protection of Birds-
is over-reaching itself by ludicrous severity, and by interfering with the
liberty of Englishmen.
I can assure Dr. Butler that I do not wish to interfere with the liberty
of Englishmen any more than is necessary for the protection of birds,,
some species of which are likely to become extinct if nothing is done (b).
I should like to ask Dr. Butler if he thinks it would be fair to a
professional catcher and dealer if an unlicensed private individual were
allowed to go out on Sundays or an} r other day and catch a score or so of
Nightingales, Blackcaps, Garden-warblers, etc., to sell again, whilst the
professional catcher and dealer were licensed. These skilful private catchers
do exist, to my knowledge, and among the doctors too--my first two
Nightingales I bought from a doctor for 30/-, and they both turned out to
be hens or non-singing cocks, so I let both go in Epping Forest. I have
bought another since, from a private individual and catcher, and he had a
dozen more to sell. Why should these private individuals be let off scot-free ?
The Society means to do its work thoroughly, and I commend it for it.

Sir,--I have a fine pair of Parrot Finches. The hen built in a box
low down in the aviary, and laid two eggs, but did not sit. The week after
this she laid four more eggs in another nest box, but again did not sit.
(6) There is not the least doubt that nothing&apos; can be done to prevent the extinction

Altogether she has laid twenty-three eggs, but never sat except for one day.
Having a pair of Bengalese which had laid three eggs and just begun to
sit, I put four Parrot Finch eggs in their nest. I also put four Parrot Finch
eggs into a Sydney Waxbills' nest, in the place of four clear eggs which
had been sat on for eight days. One young Parrot Finch was hatched by
the Bengalese, and it lived a week. The other eggs in the Bengalese nest
were clear. The Sydney Waxbills deserted their nest at the end of nine
days--two of the eggs contained young,
The Bengalese laid again, tw T o eggs, and had just begun to sit, when I
put five Parrot Finches' eggs with their own. In fourteen days four young
Parrot Finches were hatched, and are now being fed by the Bengalese and
are doing well (c).
I have some Parrot Finch eggs left, and am saving them to put under
some other finch.
The young Parrot Finch has green beads round the gape, of a
glittering appearance (d).
I think it is wise to keep a few pairs of Bengalese in readiness, to
hatch the eggs of valuable birds that will not sit, such as the Violet-eared
Waxbill. I. CartmeeR.

(Miss) R. Ai.dERSON.
The following reply -was sent to Miss Alder son :
The best staple food for Ornamental Ducks is a mixture of equal
parts of buckwheat, barle3 r , and wheat, given in water. Bread thrown
into the water is also much appreciated, as a rule.
The Tufted Ducks obtain most of their food by diving, and are very
fond of the green weeds that usually grow on the bottom of ponds, as well
as various aquatic insects and crustaceans. It would be a good plan to
throw some grain on the surface of the pond ; this would sink, and the
Tufted Ducks would obtain it in the natural way bj&apos; diving.

" I was clearing out the brute's cage," he said, "when somehow he
managed to slip out, and before I knew it, there he was sailing far overhead.
Ah, but he did look grand ! " said my friend, " as he went over the spire of
All Souls'. I gave him up for lost, but thought I would advertise for him,
and offer a reward. Some days later, I heard that a Macaw had been
captured in a distant part of Leeds : so I went to see if it was my old
friend. After a lot of trouble I found the house, and on asking if they had
a Macaw, the}&apos; informed me that some workmen had caged some kind of a
foreign hawk. The sufferings of those poor fellows in effecting the capture
appeared to have been appalling. I asked where the bird was," said Mr.
Marsden, "the woman of the house told me it was in the best bedrooin, of
which it held possession, as no one dared to enter the room. When I entered,
there, sure enough, was my old friend; but," said Mr. Marsden, with a sly
twinkle of the e}-e, " you never saw such a mess as that room was in--a
grand bedstead nearly in pieces, and the other furniture damaged past
repair. I asked the woman what she had fed the bird on ? Her reply
was, 1 Please, Sir, we gave him cats&apos; meat, as he seemed some sort of a hawk.&apos;
And, sure enough, the poor fellow had been existing on this strange diet
for several days. However," said Mr. Marsden, "I was jolly glad to get him
back; I had a big account to settle with the workmen for damage in capture ,
and for ruined furniture, besides the advertised reward."
The whole story struck me as so intensely comic--the best bedroom
given up to the Macaw, and the cats' meat diet--that I venture to send it

MIMICRY BY BIRDS IN A WILD STATE.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98921385" page_id="32638510"  page_num="Page 137" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I was for many years in India but never heard a Wild Parrakeet
imitate any other bird. The Indian Skylark, Crested Lark, and Singing
Bush-lark are all imitative, and I should say invariably introduce the notes
of other birds into their songs. I have heard an English Skylark imitate a
Chaffinch.
Last j'ear I had an Indian Grey-winged Blackbird ( Merula bulbul)
which I disposed of, and this year I was astonished at hearing some of his
notes proceeding from an English Blackbird close to the house, and I hear
them every day.
One of the Starlings which frequent the chimneys of my house,
imitated a Blackbird this }&amp;gt;ear long before the Blackbirds began singing.
The Butcher-bird in India is also a mimic, and I believe the American
Mocking-bird is so.
With reference to this subject, I have often wondered if any birds in
the Counties frequented b} r Nightingales improve their songs by the intro-
duction of Nightingale's notes. Nightingales are not supposed to come to
Devonshire, but they make an exception sometimes in favour of Honiton.
The year before last I heard one, and this year there are at least two to be
heard, day and night, close to my house.

Sir, -- I am sorry that my business arrangements have, for some time,
prevented my replying to the main' interesting queries which have of late
appeared in our Magazine, and I am afraid some even of the direct enquiries
addressed to me on bird matters have, for the same reason, been allowed to
pass without reply.
In the May number of the Magazine, however, there are so many
items that require attention,that I have been impelled to write a few words.
After expressing the great pleasure which I have in congratulating
the Society upon having secured the services of such an artist as Mr. Smit,
and of such a firm as Mintern Brothers for the exquisite reproductions of
the artist's sketches, I will begin at the beginning, and as I am doubtless
one of those to whom Dr. Butler refers in the first paragraph of his
interesting article on the Blue Sugar-bird, I will endeavour to supplement
his paper with a few remarks from actual experience of the Dacnis cayana in
captivity. My first specimen was a lieu, and a bird of this sex would
appear, to any other than an expert, to be of quite a different species from
the cock bird. The general plumage of the hen is of a bright metallic green,
while the bod}' plumage of the cock quite justifies the popular designation
" Blue Sugar-bird," and the only fault possible to be found in the illustra-
tion is the one pointed out by Dr. Butler, that it is, perhaps, not blue
enough. My birds were fed upon fruit as a staple diet: oranges, grapes,
bananas, pears, etc., as might be obtainable from time to time. They were
also supplied with sponge cake moistened with scalded milk, and a mixture
of steamed ant's cocoons, yolk of egg, and cream cheese. Of the latter
item they were extremely fond, and invariably picked out the pieces as
soon as their food was given to them. (I have found cream cheese chopped
fine a very valuable addition to the food for delicate insectivorous birds in
captivity). Two or three mealworms daily were also offered, but these
were not always eaten. My birds never seemed to ail until the last minute.
Each seemed in perfect health up to the time it was found dead in its cage.
It seems that such birds as these, and the more delicate insectivorous
British birds, get food in freedom such as we are unable to successfully
imitate in captivity (I anticipate Dr. Butler's comment that birds do not get
cream-clieese when at liberty) and that the fruit we are able to offer the
fruit-eating foreign birds is a very poor substitute for the ripe fruit and
tropical insects they have been taken away from. Any one who has eaten
ripe bananas and ripe oranges, fresh from the tree, will appreciate this
theory.
I am obliged to say that I think Dr. Butler's interesting article upon
the Sugar-bird is entirely spoilt by his last paragraph. To reason that
because a Blue Robin, a Pekin Robin, and a Blackbird have been kept in
health upon a certain food it should be tried upon such birds as the Dacnis
cayana is surely absurd)/). The three birds named will live upon almost
anything, and the Licthrix can be kept nearly entirely upon seed. Does
this make seed a desirable food for a Sugar-bird ? In thousands of cottages
in England Blackbirds are kept in health and song on scraps from the
table, supplemented by snails and earthworms. How long would a Dacnis
(/) Any member of the Society who carefully reads my article on the Blue Sugar-bird
will note that I did not recommend my regular mixture, as part of the dietary suitable
for that bird, on the grounds stated by Mr. Fulljames ; but on the ground that it agreed
with Tanagers and Zosterops. I mentioned the other species to prove that there could be
nothing injurious in the mixture as has been asserted. -- A. G. B.

live on this ? In my bird-rooms three distinct qualities of soft-food at leas
are given. Sncli birds as Nightingales, Blackcaps, Bearded and Crested
Tits, the various Warblers, and such of the fruit-eaters as will take it, are
supplied with the mixture above mentioned as having been given to the
Dacnis, with the addition of chopped lettuce, groundsel, watercress or
other greenstuff. The aviaries are provided with the mixture I have
before recommended in the Magazine (ground biscuit, crissel, ants' cocoons,
yolk of egg, dried flies, breadcrumbs, and boiled potato or grated carrot).
The Thrushes, Blackbirds, and sucli-like get a proportion of the latter
mixtnre supplemented (considerably) by ground dog-biscuit or more bread-
crumbs and potato. Some discrimination in offering food to soft-bills
*seems to me to be absolutely necessary, as, while the delicate birds would
starve or die of indigestion on the Thrushes' food, the Thrushes would
burst themselves on the first-named mixture.
To proceed to the letter of Mrs. Hartley ; I have pleasure in following
Hr. Butler's example by saying that my aviaries are always open to the
inspection of members, by appointment of course. The Hon. and Rev.
F. G. Dutton has already written an instructive and interesting article on
the Parrot section of niv birds, and some member of journalistic tendencies
and with a penchant for other foreign birds or "Britishers," might,
perchance, find material in such a visit for another article for our
Magazine.
I have no objection in complying with Dr. Butler's hint in his foot-
note to Mr. Cushny's enquiry re Rmerald Bird of Paradise. Upon hearing
from Mr. Cross that he had the bird, I went to Liverpool to see it. When I
arrived it was, to all appearances, healthy, and was feeding freely&apos; upon
chopped beef and mealworms, and I was told it would eat ordinary
" insectivorous food." The price asked was ^)ioo. After considerable
bargaining I paid #60 for it, and brought it home next morning. When I
got it home, I took the bird out of its cage with the intention of washing
its peculiarly&apos; beautiful wing coverts, and at once knew that I had made a
mistake in not " handling " it before purchase. The bird was little more
than a skeleton, and I knew at once that it would be a miracle if I could
preserve it. The meat diet had " scoured " it almost to death. Unremitting
attention was bestowed upon it without avail. With me it absolutely-
refused meat, but ate freely of hot-house grapes and mealworms. Small
cockroaches it w T ould also take, but day by day&apos; it got gradually weaker
until, in about a fortnight, a series of fits, most painful to witness, ended
its miserable life.
I believe only&apos; one other had ever been imported into England, and
this, I understand, was brought by&apos; a gentleman in his own yacht from the
Arrow (or Aroo) Islands ( e ). These Islands form a small group immediately
to the South of Papua (New Guinea) in lat. 6*-7 Q S. I believe the only
trade with the Islands is in cocoa-nuts and Bird of Paradise skins! ! The
natives, it appears, have no notion of attempting to keep the birds in
-captivity, and it is only by&apos; the merest accident that a live specimen can be
*obtained. Although my experience with my one bird was so particularly
unfortunate, I have little hesitation in saying that if the bird could be
provided with suitable food, not raw beef, there seems to be no reason why
it could not be successfully imported and successfully kept.

THE MAGAZINE.
The members will doubtless have remarked the fact that the April
and May issues consisted of twelve pages only, which is less than ever
before, since the first year of the Society. The sole reason for this was that
I had so little suitable matter in hand for publication.
If the magazine is to be a continued success, it is essential that the
members should be more active in contributing to its pages than they have
been recently. I shall be glad to receive articles and letters for publication
from any members, especially from some of those who have hitherto
written little or nothing for the magazine. We are very much indebted to
the faithful little baud of regular contributors, but it is unfair to expect
them to do the whole of the work. I should also be glad to hear from,
several who used to write for the magazine but who have not done so lately.
Horatio R. Fieemer.
THE RATE SIR H. S. BOYNTON, BART.
The Society has lost a very able and experienced aviculturist through
the death on the nth April last, after a long illness, of its esteemed Vice-
President, Sir Henry S. Boynton, Bart.
He had an interesting collection of living birds within his beautiful
grounds at Burton Agnes, in East Yorkshire, keeping, at various times,
Emus, Rheas, a fine lot of Ornamental Pheasants, most of the British
Fresh-water Wild Ducks and Geese, Eagle Owls, and a very fine pair of
Golden Eagles the female of which laid a clutch of eggs during her
owner's illness.
Sir Henry, for several summers up to 1897, had been in the habit of
bringing back with him from Norway, after the fishing season, various-
interesting birds from that country, including Eagle and Snowy Owls,
Siberian Jays, and usually a fine lot of young Gos-liawks, sometimes as-
many as six or eight in number. He spared no trouble in rearing these birds-
in their own country, and in bringing them across the North Sea: and,
being in the pink of condition, and often already partly trained, the Gos-
hawks used, when their education was completed a little later, to afford their
captor, and several other falconers in different parts of England, excellent
sport with rabbits and other quarry.
But it is as a successful keeper of the insectivorous birds that Sir
Henry excelled. His system was, in the case of the more delicate kinds,
to absolutely exclude all farinaceous food, giving nothing to the Mocking
Birds, Shanias, Nightingales, Blue and Rock Thrushes, and Blackcaps, but
ants' eggs, Carl Capelle food, preserved yolk of egg, and a few currants,,
the above moistened and given as a crumbling paste. He considered a
supply of course gritty sand a matter of great importance ; and his cages
were all roomy, allowing the inmates plenty of room for exercise. To this
treatment, and to the above diet especially, he attributed the fact that liis-
insectivorous birds always seemed in the best of condition, moulted clean,
and that they were absolutely free from those troublesome fits that so often
shorten the lives of these more or less delicate species when kept in
confinement.

THE CORDON BLEU.
Estrilda phcenicotis.
By Reginald Phieeipps.
My early experiences of this species were limited to a
Small Birds' bird room--long since closed--in which they were
practically lost amid a number of Waxbills, Mannikins, and the
like, all flying loose together. Under these conditions the}^
seemed amiable, inoffensive little creatures, without much
character or spirit ; but, given healthy specimens to start with,
I found no difficulty in keeping them alive and well.
I had not, however, tried the Cordon Bleu in the garden ;
and, on the 15th February, 1898, noticing a nice looking pair, I
purchased them forthwith, with a view to giving them a trial of
outdoor life as soon as the weather became warmer.
By the 15th April following they were in perfedt health
and condition ; and on that day I loosed them in the garden.
On and from the 17th May, I noticed that the male had become
exceedingly savage, attacking all birds (but see exception below),
irrespective of size, that approached the particular region over
which he had proclaimed a protectorate ; and I found that a nest
was being built among some Virginia creeper which covers an
upright structure in the aviary, on the almost due east side, five
feet from the ground. During the spring and summer, the
Long-tailed Grassfinches (five) did much mischief, appropriating
quite a number of other birds' nests for nesting or squatting
purposes. One pair tried very hard to obtain possession of the
Cordon Bleus' nest ; but the male Cordon fought like a little
demon, and succeeded in keeping off his formidable antagonists.
This same pair hovered about and menaced the Cordons' nest all
through the summer and autumn, at one time building a nest
just four inches above it, measuring from the nearest points;
and they took possession of it the instant the Cordons were
removed to warmer quarters for the winter.

The first clutch of eggs came to nothing.
In July they nested again, but without any feature of
general interest coming under my notice. I fear I hardly
thought of them.
Early in August these birds were again nesting: on the
3rd of that month I noticed them mating.
On October 7th, on peeping into the aviary from a window,
I found three Cordon Bleus feeding below me. So nearly alike
in size were they that, had I not known that there had been but
two in the garden, it would not have occurred to me that one
w'as a young bird. Doubtless I had seen this young bird before,
but without noticing it. The young Cordon seemed to be as
long and as large as his parents, though actually he was less
bulky. The blue seemed as brilliant as that of his father : he
was much more brilliant than his mother. The beak was pinky
white merging into black at the tip, and the crimson ear-patch
did not appear until later, but otherwise he was practically in the
plumage of the adult male. From that time I kept my eye on
him. Only once did I see him fed, and that was by his father.
At first his baby note was occasionally uttered, and this was not
unlike the squeak of the young Parrot Finch.
The parents later went to nest for the fourth time ; but
the leaves of the Virginia creeper were, falling, and soon the nest
was left fully exposed. One day there was a great uproar in the
aviary, caused by some dozen birds who had become strangely
excited at the sight of the nest and its occupant, and Were
hovering around it, the little mother, greatly concerned, hopping
nervously about in the rear of the mob. Suddenly the male
darted out from the nest at his nearest foe and was back again--
all in a flash : to have entered into combat with one bird would
have left the eggs exposed to the depredations of the others, and
he was too wary for that. I drove the birds away, and the attack
was not renewed. These eggs likewise came to nothing.
To what extent these numerous failures were due to the
cold, or to the disturbances, I cannot sa)^, but doubtless the cold
had a good deal to do w 7 ith it. It was not until quite late in the
autumn that I became aware that a pair of innocent-looking
Bearded Tits were inveterate egg-stealers : possibly they may
have had a finger in the pie. It is curious, but not one of the
birds ever attempted to defend its nest from their snake-like
approaches, which I had witnessed on many occasions without
taking in the full significance of their movements.
All the Cordons' nests were independent domed dry-grass-

lined - with - feathers affairs built in the Virginia creeper, in
practically the same spot, the later eggs being laid in a nest
attached to but just below the first, perhaps a trifle more
protected from the rain, and with the aperture more difficult of
detection.
The male sat on the eggs during the greater part of the
day: when the nest was in danger he always seemed to be in it.
I think usually the female took a spell the first part of the
morning ; at night, both, I suppose, slept in the nest. In the
last nest doubtless they were joined at night b}^ the young bird,
for in the garden the father was never seen to drive his son.
The spirit and bravery of this bird were a feature in the
character of the species which was quite new to me. During the
winter they have been qniet and peaceable with all birds but the
little son.
All three passed the winter in the house, and are still alive
and well. They never associated with the other birds, but kept
much to themselves. Not that, as a rule, they kept all together.
The parents were inseparable, sitting side by side on a tall
eucalyptus tree ; they kept quite quiet, wisely regarding the
winter as a season of rest ; they had done their work right
valiantly, and were recuperating. Not so the baby. Dike other
silly young people, he has been wanting to nest for some months,
and generally sat in another tall eucalyptus tree, opposite his
parents, singing away to the wife of his imagination,--for which
tomfoolery he occasionally received a whack over the head from
his sober-minded pater.
One day, an interesting conversation took place in the
eucalyptus tree, between the father and mother, of which I may
venture to give a translation for the benefit of those who are not
conversant with the language of this species :--
"Dad." "Well, Dove?" "I've been thinking, Dad."
" Don't be silly, Dove." " I do believe that you and I have done
something that no Cordon has ever done before." " Think so,
Dove ? " " Who ever heard of a Cordon rearing a baby in this
shivering country, eh, Dad ! " " Perhaps not, Dove. What does
the Avicultural say ? " " Says that the babies all die off like flies;
s'pose, Dad, it's too cold for the feathering, or the3 r don't mix the
pap proper." " Aha ! getting conceited in your old age, my
Dove." "Well, now; just look at him ! was there ever such a
Bleu ? and as like his Dad as two Cordons." " Ahem ! "
"Dad." "Yes, Dove?" "We must get a wife for our
Tittle Boy Blue." " Cold, isn't it, Dove ?" " All the more need

oi a wife, Dad ; how would you like to be left all alone in the
cold ! " " True for } r ou, Dove.*&apos; " And, Dad, we must teach him
how to hatch eggs." " Then j^ou'll be a granny , Dove." " Hum ;
and he's no business to be making a granny of me : more like
his sister." " But he can't get on without a wife, Dove." " Not
so sure ; she mightn't agree with him. Shouldn't like our Little
Boy Blue to be hen-pecked." " But the cold , Dove ; the cold.&quot;
" Bother the cold, Dad." " Let's snooze over it, Dove." " Let's."
And they snoozed.
On the 23rd January, 1899, I had a view of the two males
together in an exceptionally good light. I11 their colourings
they were practically identical--with one exception. Not only
was the ear-patch of the father of a much deeper and richer
colour than that of the son, but it was much larger, probably
twice as large. At the time (June) that I am writing, however,
the young bird seems the more brilliant of the two--he is
absolutely perfect.
I have obtained a wife for him. The bride was received
with much spitefulness by the old mother ; but this is rather
characteristic of mothers-in-law generally.
The four birds are now in the garden. The old parents
have settled down very quietly in their old quarters ; but alas for
the vanity and conceit of young people ! The young couple
built a large, untidy, Sparrow-like nest at the very top of a
poplar tree, in the most conspicuous and exposed place in the
whole aviary ; and the rain descended, and the floods came, and
the winds blew, and beat upon that nest,--and in a few days it
was nothing but a sodden, shapeless mass of rubbish. The}^
have learned an important lesson of life, however, more quickly
and thoroughly than their masters often do, for they have since
gone to nest in a quiet secluded spot under a shed.

LORD DERBY'S PARRAKEET.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.971983625" page_id="32638517"  page_num="Page 144" year="" vol="">
A pair of Parrakeets, of especial interest to aviculturists, on
account of their great rarity, have recently been acquired by the
Zoological Society and are now located in the Parrot-house of
the Society's Gardens. These are the first examples of the
Derbian Parrakeet that have ever occupied the Gardens. In fact
only one previous example appears to have been known. This
bird, from which the species was named, found its way into
Lord Derby's aviaries at Knowsley, where it lived for some time.

After its death it was preserved for the Derby Museum, at
Liverpool, where it is now to be seen. An excellent coloured
plate of this, the type specimen, was published in the " Proceed-
ing^" of the Zoological Society for the year 1850, together with
a description of the bird by Mr. Louis Fraser. The following is
an extract from his communication, dated November nth, 1850.
" The first specimen to which I would wish to draw the attention
of the Society, is a Parrakeet of large size, which I propose
calling Palceoi&apos;nis derbianus. . . . The specimen has been
for many years in this collection, and I have chosen for its
specific name that of its noble owner. The species is easily
distinguished from all other members of the genus by its large
size and the colours of the bill, head and breast."
Although much larger, the Derbian Parrakeet has many
points of resemblance to the Banded or Javan Parrakeet
(P. fasciatciJ ; it differs greatly however from that species in
the colour of the breast, which is an exquisite lilac in P. derbyana
and decidedly vinous in P. fasciata, the head of the rarer species
is also much bluer ; and Count Salvadori has pointed out another
important difference in the colour of the under wing-coverts,
which are vinous in P. derbyana and green in P. fasciata.
The following is a short description of the colouring of
P. derbyana : Upper parts light green ; a broad moustache on
the lower part of the cheeks, forehead and lores, black ; crown
and ear-coverts violet-blue ; underparts lilac ; bill black.
The species is said to inhabit the interior of China.
The two birds now in the Gardens are remarkably fine
specimens and there would appear to be every prospect of their
thriving. They are not so bright in colour as Wolf's drawing in
the " Proceedings," but they are probably still immature.
The acquisition of birds of such extraordinary rarity is a
matter for sincere congratulation, and they are very well worth
a visit from all who are interested in this group of Old World
Parrakeets. _D. Seth-SmiTh.

By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
The Dhyal is very seldom imported into England, and, when
he is, always commands a high price. It is nearly always the
cocks that come over as in the case of so many other
species. The cock Dhyal is like a miniature English Magpie,
brilliant black and white, and is no doubt nearly related to the
Shamah, as the two species quarrel abominably. Dhyals are very

quarrelsome birds with their own kind, and to keep two cocks
together will mean speedy death to one.
The hen Dhyal is the rarest of rare birds ; she is smaller
and slighter than her mate ; and where he is black she is a
delicate lavender.
I was fortunate enough when up in London last autumn
to secure five Dhyals, just as they came off the ship, and one of
them was a hen. It was a case of take all or none, so I took all.
They were wonderfully tame, and I think consisted of an
old cock and his four nestlings ; as one was much larger than
any of the others.
On reaching home, I had to cage off three of the cocks
separately to prevent murder ; the pair I let go in a big indoor
aviary, where they soon came into magnificent feather and
where they have remained ever since. Two of the cocks I sold,
and I reserved the odd one in case of accidents, so as to have two
strings to my bow.
One day in May when I was showing my birds to a brother
fancier, I was going to point out the hen Dhyal as the rarest
of my possessions, when to my horror I could not see her any-
where. I feared she must be dead or had slipped out unknown
to me and got lost. After looking most carefully all round the
aviary and when about to give up the hunt in despair, I suddenly
espied a long tail sticking out of a nest box. At first it gave me
a horrid turn as I thought she had crept into a box to die there ;
as I had no suspicion of nesting. On getting a chair to look
I was intensely relieved to see the tail move, so I knew it was all
right and a case of eggs. Of course I had to have a look (was
it not excusable if rash ?_) I seized my opportunity when Mrs.
Dhyal was off feeding, and to my joy found three eggs.
They are rather small for the size of the bird, pale sea-green
in colour, heavily blotched with chocolate at the bigger end, and
rounded in shape. The hen sat admirably and hatched out two
young birds, the remaining egg was clear.
The young ones when fledged just resembled the old birds,
but were very yellow at the base of the beak ; and were of the
male persuasion.
I fed on mealworms and black ' clocks.'
Later, the youngsters were both killed by the cock ; one on
one day, the other on the next, on the floor.
I was of course sorry in a way, but these things will happen,
and cock Dhyals are very quarrelsome ! ! ! This is by way of
consolation.

They were two grand young birds, and I am sure the cock
slew them out of jealously ; though he evidently is of the opinion
of Horace : " Nec pueros coram populo Medea trucidat." He
must have done the deed ; as there are nothing but tiny finches
in th# aviary.
They are busy with a new nest, and this time I shall remove
Master Dhyal as soon as the eggs are laid, as though he is useful
up to that time and very ornamental, he is decidedly blood-
thirsty to budding young cocks, and I don't believe he takes any
share in the feeding ; at least I never saw him feed.
REVIEW.
Captive Song-Birds. A pamphlet issued by the Society for the
Protection of Birds. (No. 31 J.
It may be questioned whether it is not w r aste of time to
notice this, or any of the leaflets issued by a Society whose object
evidently is to put an end to aviculture ; but the present one is
so monstrous in its demands, and so silly in its assertions, that
it can hardly be passed over without comment ; if only to show
to what lengths fictitious humanitarianism and fanaticism will
lead their votaries.
The opening and closing lines of the leaflet are practically
opposed to the study of all birds in captivity ; and the difference
between keeping a bird in a cage measuring only a few cubic
inches and in an extensive aviary are regarded as represent-
ing mere " degrees of questionable treatment." The argument,
if such it can be called, that because a bird is fitted for a life of
freedom in the open-air, it must necessarily suffer and be
miserable when its liberty is more or less restricted, is one that
nobody familiar with birds could have used : it is well-known
that many birds, when they escape from captivity, soon miss the
comforts and luxuries of aviary- or cage-life, and voluntarily
return to it.
The writer hints that but few species become habituated to
captivity, and he unblushingly asserts that the life is an un-
healthy one. As a matter of fact, there are few species which
have not been habituated to captivity amongst those which have
been kept ; and probably none which could not be. As to the
unhealthiness of cage-birds, what evidence has been collected
on the subject tends to show that they live far longer, and exhibit
infinitely more perfect plumage, when properly looked after in
an aviary, than they ever do in a wild state.

Whatever the writer may imagine, and he seems more full
of theory than fact, no bird will sing when it feels ill : it must
be what the students of bird-song call ' stout ' before it will sing
at all. Song in birds is believed to have originated in shouts of
defiance, one male singing against another ; it is now certainly
used to bring the hen into subjection. If no hen be present and
yet the male sings, he must be in abundant vigour and unable
to contain himself.
One of the most ignorant observations made by the writer of
this reprehensible pamphlet, is to the effect that birds cannot be
studied properly in aviaries ; but only in their wild state. The
truth is that many birds can be properly studied in no other
manner than in aviaries. Many scientific collectors in many
years have frequently failed to discover a solitary fact as to the
method of nidification, the colour and number of eggs, etc., of
a bird ; yet, when transferred to an aviary, the whole of the
bird's life has been laid bare. The study of birds in a wild
state may even be misleading : it led Charles Dixon to the false
conclusion that inherited instinct was a myth, and that birds
built their nests in imitation of those wherein they were born ;
whereas aviculture proved conclusively that, after hundreds of
generations of caged life, a bird turned loose in a large aviary
immediately constructed the nest of its remote ancestors : even
the songs and call-notes of birds heard in a state of freedom are
imperfectly heard and often incorrectly rendered by naturalists ;
and doubtless, where two species are together in a thicket, the
notes of one are often mistaken for those of the other.
The final assertion--that the case of Canaries differs from
that of other cage-birds, yet nevertheless sets a bad example and
encourages a " detestable trade"--is really almost too absurd.
The writer fails utterly to see that the rule which applies to wild
birds, must apply to all birds which have been originally wild ;
then, when he includes Canaries in his reprobation of aviculture,
he does not see that (to be consistent) he is bound to include
Pigeons and all kinds of domesticated Fowls. Nay, more, I must
insist that, if it be cruel for man to "have dominion over the
fowl of the air," it is equally cruel for him to keep in subjection
any living creature ; and I am not sure that he ought not him-
self (in that case) to return to a condition of irresponsible
savagery. Of a truth anyone who could calmly swallow such
nonsense as the writer of " Captive Song-birds " solemnly
indites, cannot be intellectually far removed from that early
condition of his species.

Sir, --I have a pair of Chinese Ring-necked Pheasants. The hen has
laid to-day (June 14) her thirty-fifth egg this season. Is not this a record
number for one bird ? (a)
I have a hybrid between a German Fancy Pigeon and a Zanzibar
Half-collared Dove, a most beautifully-marked cock bird. This has paired
with a hen Barbary Dove, and has had several nests, but the eggs are
always unfertile.
If any of our members are near Sydenham, I shall be pleased, any
afternoon, for them to see my collection, but should prefer (like my friend
and neighbour, Dr. Butler) a previous appointment. Perhaps Dr. Butler
might have been thinking of my experience, which may be interesting to
our readers.
Some three years ago, my birds were sent to a Foreign Bird Show at
an Exhibition in the North of London. Amongst the large crowds of
visitors, I made the acquaintance of a well-dressed gentleman who seemed
greatly interested in foreign birds. He came several times in the twelve
days the Exhibition was held, and left his card with me, asking permission
to call at Sydenham to see my aviaries. He came, and the second time
brought a lady with him ; but as it was too late to see the birds he said he
would call again, which he did, one wet afternoon. Unfortunately, for me,
while in the aviary, a friend, who was returning home to South Africa,
came to wish me good-bye. I left him in the aviary, saying he had better
wait until the rain had left off; he left a short time after, calling at the
house for his umbrella, and, with many thanks, leaving word with the
servant that he hoped to call and see me again.
The next day I missed a pair of Parson Finches--sometime before I
imported from Queensland 60 Gouldian Finches, with several fine Parson
Finches, these were all in one large cage. My man could not account for
their disappearance. I was then a little suspicious of my visitor, and found
he had stolen a small travelling cage, 10 Gouldians, and the pair of Parson
Finches--the servant noticed he had a small parcel under his arm, done up
in a newspaper. We tried to trace them, but in vain : the name was a false
one.
Some time after, at the West London Police Court, a person was
sentenced to six months imprisonment for robbery. I then found that he
was the one who had stolen the birds, and all that was left was one Parson
Finch. This well-dressed gentleman with light kid gloves was a smart
London thief.
The greater part of my birds will be at the same place next month--
Agricultural Hall, Islington, July 24th to August 8th--at the Triennial
Exhibition held there. I am afraid I may be a little suspicious, this time,
of inviting friends to Sydenham--especially if they are fashionably dressed
in light overcoat, silk hat, and light kid gloves.

Sir, --I have been wondering what luck in breeding members of the
*Avicultural Society on your side of the Channel have had this year ?
Better, I hope, than my 7 self. Perhaps some will kindly give their results in
the magazine. Except Redrumps, I have not had a single bird hatched
(that I know of) of any description. My Many-colours have done nothing
yet, and are now moulting. I lost my hen Turquoisine a mouth or two ago
and, not being able to get another, fear breeding this Parrakeet is not very
likely 7 , with me, this y 7 ear. My 7 New Zealands have done nothing at all,
although they appear to be in the best of health, and are not moulting. I
had about 18 eggs laid b3 T two Golden-crowned New Zealand Parrakeets
between January and the beginning of April--at several times--and as both
birds sat and all the eggs were clear, I conclude I have two liens
instead of a pair. A pair of Yellow Budgerigars in one of my aviaries have
not made a start yet. Small birds, Finches, etc., are doing absolutely 7
nothing, and of these I have lost a good many. I fancy the peculiar
weather we have had is chiefly 7 the cause of so much non-success jfi breed-
ing, and the losses of the small birds. The early part of the year was too
mild, and probably brought the birds too soon into nesting condition; then
followed cold, and checked them, causing death to some, and upsetting
breeding operations with others. On the whole, my losses have been
greater, and breeding results less, this season than in any other since I
have kept birds.
I had too fine cock Redrumps leave the nest last month, and the
parents have four young again two of which seem to be liens : but tlieyi are
scarcely fledged enough to tell exactly 7 . The old cock acted again this y 7 ear
in precisely the same manner as last -- he commenced maltreating the
young of the first nest as soon as the hen was about to lay 7 her second
clutch, and before they 7 could feed themselves. I had to take him out of
the cage ; and the hen laid, without him, five eggs, four of which were
good and hatched. The two first young were removed a few days before
the second lot hatched, and the old cock was put back to the hen again; he
is feeding with her as if nothing had happened. I suppose he is used to be
thus dealt with, for he seems to know what is coming when he misbehaves
himself toward his young and I go to take him away.
I have at present afresh pair of Australian Crimson Finches -- the cock
imported and the hen aviary-bred---having lost my old pair, "the fighters,"
during the bad weather. They 7 are birds of a different disposition from the
other pair, not such bullies, and are 011 the best of terms with each other,
which was not the case with the first pair -- the cock chased and fought the
hen whenever he had the chance. I have come to the conclusion that
some pairs are more pugnacious than others, and the species is generally
addicted to worry other birds lodged with them. I should not care to put
other birds of tlieir size, still less smaller ones, in their company, except in
a large aviary containing plenty 7 of bushes for shelter from their chasing
and attacks. A. SAVAGE.
THE AGE OF CAGE-BIRDS.
Sir, -- W ith regard to the age to which little foreign birds live in
captivity, I have an Avadavat flying about in my 7 bird-room which I bought
in August, 1892 ; it had then been some time in captivity and was quite
tame. It was (until a short time ago--when it met with an accident) in
beautiful plumage and brilliant colour, only getting a little greyish about
the head. (Miss) E. E. WEST.

THE STORY OF A BLUE ROBINS' NEST.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99677494" page_id="32638524"  page_num="Page 151" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- As I see you invite members, who have not hitherto done so, to
write something for the magazine, I wonder if the story of my Blue Robins'
nest would be of any interest. Perhaps someone who has kept these birds
will kindly tell me if my experience is the usual one.
I have a handsome pair which have been in my possession a year-and-
a-half. Last summer the hen laid four eggs, coloured a pretty greenish
blue, and sat for some time, but with no result. This year, towards the end
of May, when I began to hope the cold winds were over, I again fastened
up the nest -- a cigar box--in their cage, and provided hay, bass, moss, etc.,
the birds were highly delighted, and at once set to work carrying the hay,
etc. They spent very little time over the nest, however, but the hen
immediately began to lay. On the ist June, as nearly as I could judge, she
began to sit, and sat more or less diligently, but would often come off when
I went into the room, to see if I had not some mealworms for her. I
always gave her some, and she would then, generally, return to her duties ;
but sometimes remained off quite a long time, taking exercise and amusing
herself, so that I did not much expect a favourable result. The cock bird
was very attentive, and rarely ate any mealworms himself while his wife
was sitting, but would carefully kill them and then hand them over to her--
she seemed capable of sw r allowing an unlimited number.
On the morning of the 13th of June, thinking it just possible there
?night be a young bird, I gave them a few extra mealworms, plenty of ants'
cocoons, and a fresh dish of their usual food (Abrahams' mixture and
preserved yolk, mixed with breadcrumbs and made slightly damp). I then
proceeded to attend to the wants of the other birds, but, hearing an
unusual noise, returned to my Robins to see what was taking place, and
there was Mr. Robin flying in an excited state about the cage, flapping his
beautiful wings and uttering little cries of joy and triumph, while he
dangled something in his beak.with which he appeared to wish to feed his
wife. The something proved to be his first-born child ! Mrs. Robin did
not seem to quite approve of the performance, and, with open beak, flew to
the rescue, saying plainly " Give the baby to me Robert, you are too rough."
She then proceeded to try to take it from him, and, thinking the nestling
would be torn to pieces, I interfered, and it fell to the floor of the cage--
quite dead, of course. It was a nice fat little thing--I am not sure if it had
ever been fed--it may have had a little preserved yolk. I tried to catch the
cock and take him away, but the cage being large (3ft. long by 3&apos;ft. high) I
found it impossible, without frightening the birds too much, so left the
eggs to their fate. The hen then returned to her nest, and, later in the da}-,
hatched another poor little nestling, with which the parents, no doubt,
went through the same Punch-aud-Judy performance, for I found it dead at
the bottom of the cage (no attempt had been made to feed this one).
Next morning, on taking out the nest, I found another egg, with a
bird apparently alive, but I thought it might as well be drowned as share
the fate of the others, so I put it in water. There were still two more eggs,
making five in all. The parent birds seemed very glad to have no further
trouble, and, as soon as the nest was gone, both at once took a bath --eggs
were all very well, but babies quite a different thing!
When the nest-box w-as taken down, there was nothing in it but a
few strands of liay twisted round : they had taken out all the stuff they put
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.983594933333333" page_id="32638525"  page_num="Page 152" year="" vol="">
in it at first--it is a wonder the eggs were not broken, as they conld roll
about on the bottom of the box.
Is it usual for Blue Robins to treat their families in this inhuman
manner, or was there something wrong in my feeding or management ?
My birds are very tame, and my presence never seems to frighten
them.

THE MAGAZINE.
Sir,--I see you complain of want of subjedt-niafter for the magazine.
Could not members record their acquisitions, if they got anything
out of the common ? Mr. Fulljames' most interesting account of the
Emerald Bird of Paradise suggests this idea to me.
It is a great pity that no one will comment on my notes (b). It is very
unfair to any bird that its character should be left in the hands of one man.
Short notes may often contain a great deal of information, and yet
not take much time to write.

THE TORTOISE AND THE TOAD.
Sir, --At page 136, Mr. Farrar tells us of the Macaw and the cat&apos;s meat;
perhaps the following story may be allowed a corner in the Avicultural,
although it is not about a bird. The heroine of the story is known to my
sister, who told it to me but a few days ago.
A lady recently was going away from home. She had a favourite
tortoise, and, being solicitous for its welfare during her absence, resolved
on the following course for ensuring its safety. She carefully packed it up
in a boot-box, securely fastened the box, and stowed it away on the top of
a cabinet.
She was absent for from five to six weeks. O11 her return, without
the faintest foreboding of evil, she took down the boot-box, unwrapped the
creature, and, lo, &apos;twas -- dead. Greatly aggrieved, and with the feeling
that somehow she had been deeply wronged, the lady poured forth her
woes into the rather unsympathetic ears of my sister. The latter reminded
her how that previously she had always fed the tortoise regularly, on bread
and milk, lettuce, etc., to the full, and how could she have supposed that it
would have lived for over five weeks without food, water, or air !
The lady evidently regarded my sister's remarks as absurd, and gave
the following crushing reply. She had read in books, in good books too,
how that toads had been found at the bottom of coal pits hundreds of yards
deep entombed in blocks of coal, where they had been living for -- 0I1! for
ever so many years without food, water, or air, and when released had
hopped about joyful and active, so of course the tortoise ought to have
lived a paltry six weeks in the boot-box perfectly well.
Reginald Phielipps.
(i)We heartily wish that those members who have experience with Amazon Parrots
would adopt Mr. Dutton&apos;s suggestion.--E d.

MY AVIARIES.
By O. E. Cresswell.

<bodyText confidence="0.976567580645162" page_id="32638526"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
My apology for the early reappearance of my signature in
our Magazine is that I learn from the Secretary that "copy"
has of late been short. It is some time, I think, since any
member of the Society has described his or her aviary. I was
asked in our earlier days to write some account of my own, but
hesitated to do so : firstly, because my birds' abodes, of one kind
and another, are so many that a description of them all would be
wearisome, and, secondly, because I was afraid of seeming to
imply that my own arrangements were a model for others,
instead of being very sensible, as I am, of their many short-
comings. I have learnt, however, that aviculturists at least
derive pleasure from seeing and reading of the aviaries of others,
and I expressly preface this paper with the statement that I do
not put these notes together as an example of what is best;
but simply as an account of what are my own arrangements.
My aviaries are in position unlike others that I know :
they are very scattered. This arrangement has its advantages
and its disadvantages. Pro --It is pleasant, when walking about
the grounds, here and there to come upon some fresh nook with
its aviary. It is an advantage, too, to have them in widely
different situations, almost in different climates, so that birds
can have complete changes ; e.g., through the summer they can
reside in a cool umbrageous retreat, in winter on a sheltered
bank which catches every possible ray of sunshine. Contra --It
is, of course, much more expensive to erect a number of isolated
aviaries, than to erect the same number of the same size in a
row under one roof. There is, too, great increase of labour in
attending to aviaries thus located ; and this is added to, in my
case, by the fact that some of them must stand 150 feet, or even
200 feet, higher than others. Again, aviaries so placed must be
somewhat open, not exactly to the ravages of vermin, but to

scares from them. I will presently relate some precautions
adopted against these catastrophies.
Roughly speaking, my abodes of birds are of three kinds :
i.--Rooms in which they live in cages. 2.--Isolated aviaries in
which they live about the grounds. 3.--A large wired enclosure
intended, as the trees and hedges in it mature, to be a natural

oscillate (of course, weather permitting) in their cages between
garden terraces and a glazed verandah by day, and rooms by
night. Some of these are ordinary dwelling rooms, others a
comfortable suite of abodes over the stable--though cold in
winter. There is nothing worth relating of them. A little
account, however, of my birds' cottage may possibly be of
interest. In a lofty part of the grounds, which, to say the least,
are not on a level, stands a little stone ivy-clad building with
sham battlements. It was probably built late in the last century
as "a folly"; then it descended to be an indifferent dwelling-
house, and then was approaching the stage of ruin, when I
restored it, opened out a blocked-up window or two, and turned
it to its present use. Why such a building should ever have been
termed " a folly " I can't comprehend. I look upon the indi-
vidual who built it as a very wise man ; for, firstly, he chose a
position with exceptionally beautiful views of six counties--four
English and two Welsh--and a fine panorama of a district
of the winding W}^e ; and secondly, he designed an upper room
singularly well suited for my birds' comfort.
There are two rooms, both of which have chimneys and
had fire-places. As the building is on the liill-side, the lower
room is partially underground on the North side, and on the
South is approached by a flight of steps. The upper room is
reached by a few stone steps from the outside on the North. It has
two good South windows, and one West one. It is the winter
quarters of many foreign Doves, a few Parrakeets, and a tribe of
smaller birds. Some of their cages are ranged on a long table, the
length of the room ; others are on stands and tables which run on
castors, and enable the birds to be moved into the fullest sunshine.
A coppice-clad hill rises still farther to the North and East, and
gives protection to the building from cold winds. In lieu of the fire-
place there is now a stove, which burns coke. On all evenings,
from mid-October to April, which promise to be at all cold, a fire
is lit about 5 p.m., and, if properly managed, keeps the room
comfortable until 8 a.m. When there is severe frost, it is again
made up at 10 p.m. In almost all weathers one window is thrown

open, according to the wind, for part of the day, and in warm
weather, one or two are left open all day and night. During the
seven years that the room has been put to this use, I have never
had any kind of epidemic. Many birds are taken in temporarily
as invalids from outdoor quarters, and almost invariably recover,
and I cannot remember any instance of a bird having been serious-
ly chilled in it. In such severe weather as February, 1S95, the
thermometer almost touched freezing point on several nights,
but not for long ; though in an outdoor aviary, not fifty yards off,
it twice stood at 3 0 above Zero. The Waxbills continued blithe
and health} 7 , and a Cordon Bleu is now in blooming health,
which has been continuously in the room since May, 1892, save
for about five months last year, when he was out of doors. I
attribute the success of this room to the many hours through
which, in fine weather, the sun pours into it, and to the purity
of the hill air which blows into it.
2. I have many aviaries of wood and wire. They are, as
I have said, scattered about, nearly all within the higher and
carefully enclosed pleasure grounds of about nine acres, but even
so it is impossible entirely to guard against occasional scares
from vermin. Most of them have second lines of defence. I
have many large enclosures--some for adult Poultry, others for
coops and the rearing of chickens and foreign Pheasants. The
fences are six and seven feet high, and wire netting of small
mesh is carried a foot into the ground. Most of the aviaries are
placed within these enclosures, which are a great additional
protection to the inmates. It is no easy matter to select places
for aviaries, having regard both to appearances and the comfort
of the birds. I never put one up in a hurry, but try possible
positions in all kinds of weather--searching March winds,
Autumn fogs, and bright frosty mornings. The result is that, if
one wants to find a pleasant nook on a not-altogether-pleasant
day, it is almost invariably to be found on the South or West side
of an aviary. In this climate, I need hardly say that the
majority of them are designed to catch every ray of sun: only
two are under the pleasant shade of apple and walnut trees
through the middle of the louger days.
My aviaries are nearly all on the same plan, with many
variations in minor details. Their usual width is 6 feet, their
height 6 or 7 feet at the side to 8 or 9 feet in the centre of the
span ; and their length from 14 to 24 feet. Their narrowness
may surprise some aviculturists ; it is not of choice, but almost of
necessity, for nearly all are on sloping ground, and every foot of
width adds to the amount of brickwork, sometimes a veritable

wall, necessaty to support the lower side. As far as possible, they
run North and South ; at the North end is the inner house, of
course all thickly match-boarded, and the boarding of the roof
is covered with corrugated iron.
I find it convenient, for the catching of small birds, to
have a door covered with fine wire netting between the house and
the outer flight, though, as a rule, such doors are fastened open.
The outer flights differ greatly in detail ; they and the inner
houses are all span-roofed, with ornamental iron-work running
along the ridge. The flight of one aviary is entirely boarded
over, and the whole length of its Eastern side is boarded too.
Most of them are half roofed with boarding and zinc, and half
with fine wire netting. The roof of one is partially glazed instead
of being boarded ; this seems to suit the Waxbills and small
Finches as a residence for Summer, and even till late Autumn.
It is an additional protection against wind if the sides of the
flight, or even the most exposed side, are boarded for a few
feet next to the inner house. The floors of the outer flights,
when entirely roofed over, are covered with river-sand and fine
gravel nearly a foot deep ; those partially roofed over are
gravelled in the same way under cover, and the open part is
covered with rich earth to the same level as the gravel. Here
I plant shrubs, by preference climbers trained up the
netting, elder, box, wild plum, and especially China rose and
French honeysuckle (the latter grows most rapidly and is
deliciously fragrant all the Summer), in them I tie little baskets,
nearly flat-bottomed, in which Doves of all kinds delight to nest.
For small birds I tie cocoanuts to nails and perches, generally
under cover, and put small box-cages on shelves in the house,
of course with the doors fastened open. Many perches, mostly
of natural boughs and twigs, are placed all about both in the
inner houses and the outer flights.
I may here give two hints. Firstly, that the makers of
such aviaries often send iron cross-rods to add to their stability :
it is well to insist upon wood being used for this purpose ; iron
is dangerous to feet alike in great cold and great heat. Secondly,
it is best to have wire netting, both of strong gauge (not less than
19) and small mesh ; there is no great difference between the
prices of iin. and Ain. mesh--the latter will confine the smallest
birds, and can scarcely be bent.
As I have said, the woodwork of my aviaries is all raised
upon brickwork ; they are not safe without it, and where rodent
vermin abound (which, fortunately, is not the case with me) fine
strong wire netting should be laid over the entire area under

ground. The floors of most of my inner houses are of wood,
somewhat raised above the level of the ground outside; those
for small birds are thickly covered with river sand, for large
ones with pine sawdust.
3. My large enclosure--"The Paradise" we call it--has
only lately been finished, and is, of course, very bare of foliage;
but yet much less so than might be expected, for when shrubs
are moved from one's own grounds (as many of mine were) they
bear transplanting better than when procured from nurserymen.
I often longed to see the agile flight of my foreign Doves in a
larger space than my aviaries afforded ; now and then one
escaped--once many--and how happy did they look flitting from
tree to tree ! Every season, too, nest after nest was lost from the
intrusion and persecution of pairs who set their affections on the
same abode. My first idea was to enclose a bit of a wood, with
thick shrubs ready grown and trees enveloped in masses of ivy--
perfect fastnesses for nesting. Mature consideration showed that
the plan was impracticable. For a great portion of the year
such an enclosure would be dank and miserable, and the fall of
a tree might do untold damage. I therefore fell back upon a
less ambitious plan ; but one which alread3 r gives much pleasure
to myself, and, apparently, to the birds (which have been but a
fortnight in it), and promises, in the end, to be both successful
and ornamental. I was making a number of large pheasantries
for foreign Pheasants in a lofty paddock. This paddock slopes
rapidly from East to West, on both of which sides it is protected
by thick woods ; on the North it is also protected, by a fine row
of old beeches ; on the South it is entirety open. Between two
large pheasantries I got in such an ordinary aviary as I have
described, running North and South. At right angles to it, so
that instead of opening into space the door of the flight should
open out into this larger enclosure, is " The Paradise." It is 64
feet long sloping rapidly length-wise, and 24 feet wide. The
height of the sides is 7 feet, that of the central span between 13
and 14 feet. It is entirety covered with 1 inch mesh strong netting,
which is carried a foot into the ground, and on the North side is
partially boarded. There was some contrivance to make its span
at once perfectly strong and light to look at. The central ridge
is supported by }^oung felled oaks, up which, already, ivy and
Virginian creeper are growing Half-way between the side-posts
and the central ridge it was necessary to have strong uprights :
these are yews and spruce-firs cut down in my own grounds, with
many small side boughs left for perches ; creepers have been
planted to grow up them. Along the whole length of the North

side, save where it is broken by the aviary at right angles in the
centre, a Thuja hedge is planted in the pheasantries next to it,
which, in time, will be a great protection. Along the whole
South side, and here within the wire, is planted a privet hedge
(:Ligustrum ovalifolium ) which turns the corners at both ends.
Various other bowers-to-be are planted, and some quite big
shrubs are doing well. Towards the two ends, East and West,
are limes destined to be cut into arcades as one sees them on the
shores of Swiss and Italian Takes.
Creepers have not been forgotten. Travellers in Japan
record that we hardly know what wistarias are till we have sat
under them in Japanese tea gardens. Wistarias are planted to
grow up the side posts and, it is hoped, one day to meet over
head. But I am making too long a story of what, after all, is
only a modest aviary containing about 16,000 cubic feet.
Within eight days of the Doves having been turned into
it, there were several nests, some of them made by birds which,
poor things ! have never before been able to nest. There is, too,
very little squabbling, simply because those who don't like each
other can keep apart. There are a couple of coops with small
Pheasants within it, which neither interfere nor are interfered
with.
I should add that, on all sides, there is a second line of
defence, i.e., other enclosures, which add to the safety of " The
Paradise." It is conspicuous from the windows of the old
"folly"--of the last century; probably late in the twentieth
century, if some of its trees survive, it too will be called "the
folly" of a strange aviculturist of the nineteenth century.
THE GOLDEN-SHOULDERED PARRAKEET.
(Psephotus chrysopterygirisJ.
By Reginald Phillipps.
Those of our members who are interested in Parrakeets
may remember that, in July, 1898, fsee vol. iv.,/&amp;gt;. 155J I mentioned
having shut up a female of this species with a young male
Redrump.
Tater in the year, having disposed of those Parrakeets
which would have persecuted these birds, I loosed them in the
birdroom with garden attachment.
I had failed to obtain a male Golden-shoulder; but the
female and the Redrump became inseparable friends.
In the spring of this year I noticed, day after day, feathers

of the Golden-shoulder lying about, and supposed that she had
commenced to moult; and she was looking very ragged and
untidy. On two occasions, however, I picked up a very substan-
tial " mouthful " of her blue lower-back feathers, and not till
then did it dawn upon me that the feathers I had noticed lying
about had probably been pulled out by the Redrump in his
endeavours to stop her and bring her to reason. The two birds,
moreover, were very adtive prospecting all over the place, and
more than once seemed inclined to settle down in some nesting
spot, but w'ere invariably ousted by an old Musky Rorikeet, who,
" paired " with a Golden-fronted Parrakeet (Bivtogerys tuiparaJ,
was determined upon nesting, and in turns took possession of
every box and log that I was able to supply, ruthlessly destroying
every nest that came into his way ; and so it came about that
I ceased to concern myself with the doings of the Golden-
shoulder.
On May 14th, I suddenly became aw r are that the Golden-
shoulder must be sitting, and found she had a nest in the bird-
room, close by the door; and, feeling in the log, I found it
contained four eggs. As there were other birds in the bird-room
I was obliged to go in occasionally; but she sat so timidly that
she invariably dashed out of the room the instant I touched the
handle of the door. Otherwise she sat well, never coming off
the nest but for the shortest possible time. While sitting, I
think she was never fed on the nest by the male Redrump. The
Redrump, nevertheless, could not have been more watchful and
attentive. By word of mouth, he let her know everything that
was going on in the outside world. They had a by no means
meagre vocabulary, and, although of different species, under-
stood one another perfectly. Should anyone appear, instantly a
few very high-pitched piercing notes were sounded in rapid
succession, almost as high pitched as the squeak of the bat
which is inaudible to some ears. When that note had been
uttered, the Golden-shoulder would lie like a log. Indeed,
except when disturbed, I doubt if she ever left the nest until he
came for her, and called her off with a few shrill whistles followed
by pretty warbling notes, which she usually obeyed at once. He
would then instantly feed her ; and she would quickly rush off for
a nibble at the green grass or something, and dart away back to
her nest accompanied by her warbling mate.
On not less than two occasions, the Musky Rorikeet
invaded the nest. The Redrump made no offer of assistance ;
but the Golden-shoulder, from the interior of her log, growled

so fiercely and ominously that the Rorikeet thought better of it
and withdrew.
But their hopes and mine were doomed to disappointment,
for the four eggs were clear.
Whether this was the fault of the individual Redrump, an
aviary-bred specimen I am told, which never seemed to have half
the life and energy of my former Redrumps and has not grown a
full-length tail to this day, or whether the sterility was owing to the
birds being of different species, I am not able to say. It does
seem a pity that a male Golden-shoulder should be unobtainable.
The eggs are small, of a stout oval in shape, of precisely
the same length as those of the Peach-faced Rovebird but
thicker.
A few preliminary attempts at a second nest were made,
but without results; and both birds soon afterwards fell into
moult.

NESTING OF THE SCOPS OWL

(Scops giu.)
By E. G. B. Meade-Waldo.
Two pairs of this delightful and grotesque little Owl have
nested and successfully hatched and reared all their young ones
in our aviaries this summer. The Owl family have always held
the first place in our affedtions amongst the birds kept here, both
as aviary inmates, and as wild inhabitants of our woods and
farms. The Scops Owl, a very occasional straggler to these
islands, is a regular summer visitor to Southern Europe, and is
almost or entirely an insedt eater.
I have always found them very difficult to start in confine-
ment, as they require a most astonishing supply of insedts and
other tender food. However, they seem to get hardier after a
time, and, provided they have sufficient suitable food, have
thriven. They become delightfully tame. For the last two
years we have had a pair flying loose in a conservatory attached
to the house, who, when a door was opened, used to come into
the hall, perching on the pidtures and the tops of the doors ;
and who would come down to be fed, and allow themselves to be
picked up, without showing the slightest fear. The sight of
a stranger will, however, transform them at once into what
appears to be a broken-off piece of decayed wood with rough
bark on it. This is done by quickly but almost imperceptibly

drawing all their feathers tight to the body, standing very
upright, drawing the shoulder of the wing next to the supposed
enemy half across the breast, elevating the ear tufts, and almost
shutting the eyes. The protection of this manoeuvre is most
complete. It is done by all the Owls, but in the Scops family it
appears to arrive at its most perfect development.
The first pair of Scops that nested with us this summer
chose a good sized and solidly-made box with a lid in which a
certain amount of decayed wood was placed ; they had a roomy
aviar}^ to themselves. The cock commenced to call almost
continuously from the middle of April, and the first egg was laid
the 12th of May. The hen commenced to sit on May 17th, when
she had completed her clutch of three eggs: differing from the
generality of Owls, who usually commence incubation with the
laying of the first egg. The young were hatched on June 10th,
so incubation lasted twenty-four days, the shortest period of any
Owl. They were covered with white down, grew most rapidly,
and left the nest strong perchers on July 1st, and were apparently
larger than their parents, but with short tails and wings, though
able to fly several yards. They are now, July 10th, strong on
the wing. The hen alone sat, and was carefully attended by the
cock, who also did the whole work of providing food for the
3^oung until they left the nest, the hen staying with them and
tearing it up. The food consisted of Cock-chaffers, May-flies,
Alder and Caddis-flies, all of which were, fortunately, abundant
at the right time, also Cockroaches and Mealworms, with young
Sparrows and Mice ; the amount of food this little family would
consume was something astonishing, on one occasion when
nearly ready to leave the nest they cleared up twenty-five Short-
tailed field voles in one day--besides many insects.
The second pair went to nest ten days later, and have
behaved precisely as the first pair, except that the cock has
usually roosted with the hen in the nest. This pair have not
got an aviary to themselves, but have for companions a Siberian
Jay, a Spanish Azure-winged Pie, and a pair of Black-breasted
Sandgrouse.
The white down in the nestling is replaced by a plumage
almost precisely resembling that of the adults, so they differ
from all the Owls, except the Barn Owls, in having no inter-
mediate down on the body between the casting of white down
and the assumption of the full plumage.

A YELLOW-FRONTED AMAZON
By A. G. Butler, Ph.D.
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.996699585365854" page_id="32638535"  page_num="Page 161" year="" vol="">
The Hon. and Rev. F. G. Dutton has expressed a wish to
hear of the experience of other members of the Society touch-
ing Amazon Parrots.
About 1893 an aunt of mine, who was moving, asked me
if I should like to have her old Amazon Parrot: the bird had
been twenty years in her possession and had previously been the
pet of two other owners, though for how long she could not
ascertain. As I understood that it was a good talker I gladly
accepted it, and it remained in my possession until its death in
February, 1898 : it is quite likely that this parrot was from forty
to fifty years old when it died.
Mr. Abrahams, who saw our Amazon soon after it was
given to us, unhesitatingly declared it to be a hen (I believe
chiefly on account of the pale colour of its eyes) and dissection
after its death proved conclusively that he was correct.
The bird was a Yellow-fronted Amazon ; and, so far from
being unable to talk, it had entirely forgotten its own language ;
so that when enraged (as it was off and on every day of its life)
it shouted at the top of its voice exactly like a naughty boy :
indeed on one occasion a visitor to our house imagined that a
drunken man must have got into the kitchen, where the bird was
kept.
Dike most birds, and especially Amazons, Polly was
intensely jealous and exceedingly treacherous : even our
servant, who used to walk about with the bird on her shoulder
and who could do almost what she pleased with it, got bitten
once or twice. It liked me very well and soon learned to call
me Arthur, but my wife was no favourite aud my son it detested,
which did not surprise me, since he always teased it for the
fun of hearing it shout and sob.
As Mr. Dutton says of the Blue-fronted Amazon, our bird
often had conversations with itself, the questions being almost
all unintelligible and the answers invariably ' No! ' spoken
very decidedly. It undoubtedly knew when to say certain things
and only said them at the proper time : for instance if it saw
any of us dressed to go out it would say--' Are you going out ? &amp;gt;
' Are you going in the Park ? ' and as you left the room it said
' Good-bye ' or ' Good-dight ' always saying the first in the morn-
ing and the second in the evening.
Perhaps the greatest proof of the reasoning power of these
birds was that when my servant w 7 ent upstairs leaving Polly

alone, she soon got tired of her own company^ and began to call
' Addie ' (she usually pronounced n like d) and when no notice
was taken she tried to bring her down by an admirable imitation
of the shout--' Ba-ker ! '
It was very funny 1o see the knowing way in which our
bird cocked its head on one side when asking a question--
' Quite well ? ' ' Got a headache ? ' and, when she was answered,
she always said--' Oh ! ' and sometimes--' Quite right.'
Some years before this Amazon was given to me, a child
was staying with my aunt, whose nurse was an Ayah, named
Nana : the child used to call out its nurse's name, and the
parrot, not being able to say Nana learned to shout Lala at the
top of its voice. As an evidence of how sounds having no
meaning in themselves may be misinterpreted by those anxious
to make sense of them, it is significant that at least two of our
neighbours insisted that they had repeatedly heard our bird call
out ' Mother! '--a word which it never spoke and perhaps had
never heard.

BREEDING PLUMAGE of the COMMON AVADAVAT.
f SporcEginthus amandava ).
By W. T. Page, F.Z.S.
The birds (r cock and 2 hens) are kept all the year round
in a garden aviary, the front of which is always open to the
weather.
1896. Moult commenced December 4th, completed Jan.
3rd, 1897. I 11 full color, June 6th, 1897.
1897. Moult commenced December iotli, completed
December 30th. In full color, June 30th, 1898.
1898. Moult commenced December 5th, completed
January 14th, 1S99. In full color, June 20th, 1899.
The above data refer only to one and the same bird--as
aforementioned I have only one cock ; when out of color he
resembles the hens, with the exception that the red rump is
more intense and there are several small black fan-shaped spots
on his breast.
The assumption of breeding plumage is brought about by
a growth of color in the feathers, though one or two of the
larger flights are moulted at this time--I cannot say how many
as I did not catch him--it would have disturbed his nesting
companions too much.
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.9786218125" page_id="32638537"  page_num="Page 163" year="" vol="">
The hens moulted concurrently with the cock, the moult
in their case being a little more protracted.
The hens sing, though their song is neither so sustained
nor so varied as that of the males.
It would be interesting if those who keep the Avadavat
indoors would publish their data--as these birds in a state of
nature moult somewhere about February or March, whereas
mine have moulted regularly in December, it would appear as if
this variation had been brought about by climatic conditions ;
though one would have looked for the opposite : i.e.. Summer or
early Autumn for the moult instead of December.
I attribute my success in moulting them out of doors in the
Winter, to their so readily eating the soft food and mealworms.
I use Abraham's, Arthur's and Maschke's soft food alternately,
with a liberal addition of ants cocoons.

BIRDS OF KUMASI, WEST AFRICA.

Sir,--I send 3 7 ou a few notes in the hope they maj^ be of interest.
When I was in Kumasi in May, of last year, I made the acquaintance
of an old chief, who ruled an outlying district, and by dint of much
explanation, I got him to understand that I was interested in birds, and he
promised to send me some. He first sent me a very large Hornbill, which
was a great pet for some weeks till a young Blotched Genet, that used to run
about 1113' hut, one day made an end of him. He had an extraordinary trick
of swallowing a large bead I had on my table, and then when I held out my
hand he would return it in such a solemn fashion that all my visitors used
to be vastb' amused. That he really swallowed it I know, for I could feel it
in his crop.
Shortly after, a part3 7 came in from my friend the chief, bringing a
couple of Touracos: they were the Thick-billed Touraco and were exactly
the same as the Senegal Touraco in colouring, but were a trifle larger, and
had yellow beaks instead of red. Well, one died but the other did well
and is still alive: he survived a journey in a cold room up the channel in
Februar3^ of this year, so must be pretty tough. I gave him to Mr. Housden
and hope he will like him. This bird is commonly called the ' Clock bird'
on the Coast, from his habit of going off like an alarum clock at dawn ;
mine always did it when I was at Cape Coast Castle, and always preceded
his gruff note of ' hough-hough-hough ' ad lib. with a shrill ' kik.' The
power of swallowing is enormous for the size of the bird, half of a large
banana slips down his gullet with the greatest ease. Mine was a most
cleanly bird, and so tame that he alwa3 7 s tried to get into 1113&apos; tub in the
morning as soon as I poured it out, even if I was in it myself: I might add
he was nearty alwa3 7 s loose.

morning, I onlj r twice saw tlie bird, but then a green bird in a thick green
tree is never a conspicuous object.
Nearly all the huge cotton trees in the Sacrifice Grove at Kumasi
were destroyed by our troops in the 1895 Expedition, but one monster was
left among other smaller ones. In a hole about 40 feet up a pair of Grey
Parrots were nesting in February, 1898. I went up by means of a bamboo-
ladder, and found three white eggs about the size of a Woodpigeon's. In
about a month the young ones were old enough to come to the mouth of
the hole and look out, when I took them. One died, but two I still have:
they are very tame, sham death, and do lots of ridiculous tricks and also
are beginning to talk fairly well. I found the Sierra Leone Grey Parrot
to be a much darker and uglier bird than the Gold Coast kind, perhaps it
is P. timneh, please inform me Mr. Editor.
I will send you a few further notes, if they will be of any interest, on
the birds of Sierra Leone. Boyd Horsbrugh,
Lieut. A rmy Service Corps.
PYTELIA MELBA AND PYTEL 1 A AFRA.
Sir,--I should be glad if some expert of the Avicultural Society
would explain the differences between Pytelia melba and Pytelia afra.
There seems to be some confusion between the two species, both of which
are described as the Red-faced Finch.
At the end of March last year I received a splendid pair of Red-faced
Finches, and a week later a second pair from the same source. This second
pair I took to be an immature pair of the same species as the first pair.
The horizontal white lines on the breast were not nearly so pronounced,
and the red on the face of the male was only represented by a few small
spots. But as no change took place in these birds after several months'
possession, be}'ond perhaps a few more red spots on the male's face, I began
to regard them as something distinfit from the first pair. One very marked
difference exists in the colour of the feathers under the tail. In the first
pair these are quite white, but in the second pair the white is crossed bv
dark bars. On referring to the illustration of Pytelia afra in Dr. Butler's
work on 1 Foreign Finches,' I find these dark bars are represented. I have
therefore formed the opinion that the second pair are Pytelia afra , and the
first pair Pytelia melba.
The two Pytelia melba and the hen Pytelia afra were exhibited at the
Crystal Palace, in October, 189S. The report in the Avicultural Magazine
referred to all three birds as Pytelia afra. Another periodical called the
cock Melba a Wiener's Waxbill. Acting on this information I entered the
cock Melba at the Alexandra Palace in November, 1S98, as a Wiener's
Waxbill. The same paper then stated that it was incorrectly entered. At
the Crystal Palace Show in February, 1S99, the cock Pytelia melba was
exhibited alone, and the pair of Pytelia afra together. In this case the
report in the Avicultural Magazine expressed a doubt as to whether the
two exhibits were really two species as entered. I11 the Feathe?-ed World ,
of June 23rd, both pairs are spoken of as Pytelia melba.
The hen Melba died at the Roj-al Aquarium Show in November, 189S,
and the cock Afra came home dead from the Crystal Palace Show in
February, 1899, but both birds are preserved and mounted for future
reference. The cock Melba and the hen Afra are still alive and in the best
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.98657162" page_id="32638539"  page_num="Page 165" year="" vol="">
of health and feather. It has been said that it was a pity that a hen was
not shown with the cock Melba at the Crystal Palace Show in October,
instead of separately. It would have been a far greater pity if it had been,
or except in the case of the Shama I have never known a hen to be so
ill-treated by its mate. When first received they were the best of friends,
and so remained for nearly two months, when one morning the hen was
found with several feathers missing, and the head bleeding, in a corner of
the cage. Each bird was then kept in a separate cage, and about eyery
two weeks an attempt was made to put them together, but the persecution
always recommenced immediately. This state of things continued till the
death of the hen in November.
The pair of Pytelia afra on the contrary always remained together in
perfect friendship, and three white eggs were laid on the floor of the cage,
with an interval of about a week between each. The first egg was placed
in a nest suspended in the cage, but the other eggs were laid on the floor as
before. The three eggs were kept in the nest for a long time, but the birds
took no further notice of them. If they had returned in safety from the
Crystal Palace they would have been allowed to try again in an aviary, but
unfortunately only the hen returned alive.
All attempts to mate the hen Afra with the cock Melba have proved
most unsuccessful. E. W. Hawkins.
BEARDED TITS.
Sir, --In the last number of the Magazine Mr. Phillipps writes of a
pair of Bearded Tits in his aviary as "inveterate egg stealers.'' It is much
to be hoped that the pair he kept were exceptions to the rule in regard to
behaviour. I have not kept these interesting birds till this season, but now
have a pair in a small aviary, which is built over a ditch, and in which my
Kingfisher "Johnnie" lived four years; though it is an ideal place for
Bearded Tits they have made no attempt at nesting, but in the same place
are a pair of Goldfinches, which have successfully nested, also a cock
Serin Finch mated with a hen Lesser Redpoll--these have also nested--and
though I have seen the Bearded Tits daily within a few inches of each nest
no egg has been disturbed. The hen Redpoll laid five eggs, but only two were
fertile: one young one died, the other is a fine bird now flying about, and
the hen Redpoll is again sitting on five eggs. I am not sure if this cross
has been previously recorded, but I fancy they should be pretty little
hybrids.
It seems a pity the American Goldfinch or Siskin ( C . tristis) should
be so difficult to keep. I have had several but they all seem to go off in a
few months; many dozens W'ere imported in Londou this spring and I
should imagine not a tenth part are now alive. If we could only get some
bred here they might be hardier.
I am afraid the very changeable weather we have had this summer
will have made it a bad season for the breeding of British birds in aviaries.

dealers always have a large stock about June; the females are very rare
and probably few of our Members have ever seen a genuine live one.
I was fortunate enough to secure three hens last autumn, and I was
able to winter them all right; and this spring I turned them out in two of
my big outdoor aviaries, one pair in each. The reason for this is that
Nonpareil cocks are so abominably combative that if two were put together
one would soon have to yield up the ghost. As it was, for some days, the
two cocks spent most of the day trying to get at each other through the
dividing wires of their aviaries.
I saw once that someone asked if Nonpareils changed colour. They
do, most undoubtedly ; in winter the cock is quite a sober looking gentle-
man, and only gets his splendid livery as summer draws on. Another
thing--they take about three years before they come into full colour, (b)
The hen Nonpareil is a very sober little lady ; a sort of olive green
on top and very pale buff below.
She has not the slightest suspicion of blue about her, and if she has
(though it sounds a bit Irish) she is an undoubted young cock. Nearly all
the so-called hens are young cocks. I once looked carefully through
about sixty so called hens one by one, and out of the whole lot, only two
were genuine hens.
I suspeft that very few people keep Nonpareils for any length of
time, as they are, like our own Chaffinch, more than half insectivorous, and
a seed diet soon leads to wasting away or consumption.
The cock has a pretty little song and he is very fond of sitting on the
top of a bush and giving out his performance. I often hear mine singing
quite late at night when it is almost dark.
My birds built their nest in a box tree, quite low down, and it was a
very pretty affair, made externally of fine hay and grass and lined inside with
fine roots and horsehair. The hen laid three eggs and sat splendidly, she did
not seem to mind my looking at her one bit. The eggs are sea green in
colour and heavily blotched with sienna brown on the big end. They are
in fact somewhat like a small Dhyal's egg. Two young were hatched and
one egg was clear and I have it now. At first the young were covered
with very dark fluff, like young Bullfinches.
So far as I could see the hen did most of the feeding, at any rate the
cock did not let me see him stoop to domestic duties, though I dare say he
did some. Whenever I went in to feed he perched himself on a high twig,
as if to say : " Now what are you up to ? " The hen soon got to know that
my visits meant food for the babies, and she was always ready for me after
a few days. When the young are being fed their call-note is something
like si, si, si.
The excreta are carried out to a distance and dropped.
The young grew grandly and at the end of about thirteen days left
the nest, July 7th. The}&apos; are funny little grey birds with black beaks and
stumpy little tails.
I saw them yesterday, July 22nd, and the tails were more presentable,
and they fly very decently, and very proud do the parents seem of them.
(6). I have had a good many of these birds, but my males never put on a different
plumage for the winter ; moreover, the numbers exhibited at our Shows are always
recognizable as typical, whether exhibited in winter or summer. I have had two hens,
one of which is still living. I purchased her some four or five years ago in nestling plum-
age.--A. G. B.

The young were reared entirely on insect food; and only those who have
tried, know what that means.
I believe that this is the first time that Nonpareils have ever been
bred and reared in England and therefore my pair are justly proud of
their effort. C. D. Farrar.

Sir, --I should like to ask you or any member of the Avicultural
Society whether the above bird, Turduspolyglottus (Wilson), is the wonderful
mimic he is made_(c)nt to be in books.
I have had one for twelve months, and he is in good health and song
(he is singing now) and his song much resembles the chirping of a good-
sized chicken. As for his mimicry, I don't detect him mimicking either
human being, animal, or bird, although dogs, cats, ten different kinds of
birds, children, etc., abound. Now I have heard this power of mimicry
questioned by others, though, in a book I have just read, a writer states
that he has heard the bird mimic 24 different sounds of beasts and birds.
I should, therefore, be very glad if any English aviculturists will
state what their experience is of the bird's vocal abilities, (a)
A. Jones.
THE AGE OF CAGE-BIRDS.
Sir, -- In the March number, Mr. Meade-Waldo has an article on the
ages to which birds live in confinement, and he hoped the members would
be induced to record any that seemed to be sufficiently important. I have
kept account of dates of purchase of the smallest Finches and Waxbills,
and when death ensued, and in the majority of cases about eight years
seems to be the length of duration of their lives in confinement when kept
in cages.
Here are a few cases. On the nth June, 1889, I bought three birds--
a hen Green Avadavat and a pair of African Grey Waxbills. The former
lived to 27th March, 1897 -- within three months of eight years. The pair
of Waxbills died in the same year : the cock on the 31st May, and the lien
on the 20th July -- one just under, the other a little over, the above-mentioned
time. O11 the 8th November, 1889, a pair of Orange-cheek Waxbills arrived ;
the cock lived until the 17th January, and the hen until the 20th February,
189S. These dates were a little over the usual period.
I can ' go one better ' than our Secretary with regard to his pair of
Golden-breasted Waxbills, that he has had about seven years {vide April
number, page 112). A pair was sent me 011 the 12th of June, 1890; the cock
getting through the f-inch bars of the cage, was killed the same year bj*
a cat; but the hen is still in good health. As Mr. Goddard wrote that they
had moulted with him the previous autumn, she must have been in this
country for ten years.
The above are cage records with regard to duration of life in confine-
ment. Do any of our members keep their wee birds longer in outdoor or
indoor aviaries? If so, will some of them kindly give the average age of
their feathered friends. W. T. CaTreugh.
(a). I gave a detailed account of my American Mocking-bird in the Feathered World
for April 5th, 1895, and I have again described it much more fully in my Articles on
Foreign Bird-keeping (F. W. 1898, chapter IV). This bird is a superb singer and mimic:
possibly Mr. Jones may possess a hen.--A. G. B.

In writing of the Princess of Wales's Parrakeet (Polytelis
alexandnz) only superlative adjectives can be used. Of all the
Parrakeets it is the rarest, the most elegant in shape, the most
beautiful and at the same time the most delicate in colouring,
the tamest, the most desirable as a pet, and the least objection-
able in " song." I had almost written that it was absolutely
without objection in regard to the screaming which is such a
drawback to the keeping of Parrots ; but when it likes, the
Princess of Wales's Parrakeet has a very shrill whistle which is
somewhat trying to the human ear. This, fortunately, is only
resorted to occasionally, and then only when it is protesting
against attentions being bestowed upon other inmates of the
bird-room. There is one other superlative adjective which,
unhappily, must be applied to the bird--it is most delicate in
constitution. Possibly in the remote wilds of the extreme
interior of Australia, whence the bird comes, it finds some food
which cannot be imitated in captivity, or possibly the very few
specimens of which I, or any one else for that matter, have had
any knowledge, have been extra delicate representatives of the
species.
Only one specimen has ever been acquired at the Zoo, and
that was "deposited" in 1895 (cC). On my last visit to the Gardens,
the bird was alive, but was sadly " out of form." Of my own two
specimens, the cock did not survive importation very long ; and
the hen has required considerable attention ever since I have had
her. Many times her life has not seemed worth a day's purchase.
For a long time she refused seed altogether, and was kept
alive entirely on fruit and sponge-cake, with port wine and
(a) I distinctly remember seeing&apos; two specimens of Polytelis alexandree at the Zoo a
few years ago : one was, I believe, the property of the Society, and the other was deposited.

beaten egg in the place of water for drinking. She is now in a
healthy moult, and is living on a mixture of millet and canary
seed.
The extreme rarity of the bird seems to be due to the
difficulty of getting it through the journey of a thousand and
odd miles to the coast, across a country devoid of roads. With
my two birds were brought down two others, a pair, and these
were "deposited" in the Adelaide Zoo by the gentleman, an
Australian explorer, who had brought them from the interior.
Of this pair the cock bird, like my own, has since died, but
fortunately not before a pair of young ones had been hatched,
and I believe these are now doing well in the Gardens. If they
are for sale upon the return visit to Australia of the friend who
gives me the information, they will be bought for me, so I may
yet have another pair.
In view of the admirable drawing by Mr. Smit, a repro-
duction of which appears in this number, it is quite unnecessary
for me to describe the plumage of this beautiful bird, especially
as, although even a painting must fail to do justice to the delicate
gradations of colour to be found in the living specimen, a
written description would, to a still greater extent, fall short of
adequately expressing those wonderful combinations of rose-
,colour, grey, green, and blue.
THE BLACK LARK.
Melanocorypha yeltoniensis.
By Reginald Phillipps.
Except in the London Zoological Gardens, I have never
seen or heard of this species being kept in confinement; and in
my limited library, the only accounts of it that I can find are in
the Royal Natural History and in the Catalogue of Birds, British
Museum, Vol. XIII.; and I have kept only one pair. It must be
borne in mind, therefore, that my observations have been based
solely upon these two birds, living under unnatural conditions,
and fed, while breeding, almost entirely upon mealworms.
On the 19th February, 1898, I obtained a pair of Black
Larks. They were so weak from having been fed only on seed
that for a time I despaired of saving the male. As soon as they
were strong enough, they were placed in the garden, where they
have been from that time to this,--during the winter with the
free run of the whole aviary, but during the rest of the year shut
off in the reserved portion, which is so crowded with trees and

shrubs as seriously to interfere with their flight and general
welfare. Happily there are some sheds nearly four feet, and a
structure above seven feet, high, on the roofs of which they pass
a great deal of their time. And the female often used to sit on
two thick perches fully eight feet from the ground, one on either
side of the aviary, and would sometimes spend a good half-hour
flying backwards and forwards from one to the other. Our Sky
Lark, be it remembered, in some parts of the country freely
perches on stone walls.
It was not to be expected that such exceptionally timid
and nervous birds, and withal so weak, should nest the first
summer. A certain amount of flirting went on : during some
months the male was perpetualty trotting about, warbling almost
unceasingly, with his tail cocked up in the air. This spring,
however, I considered they might nest; the reserved aviary had
a number of little finches in it, but every bird was removed that
was likely to interfere with them. Unfortunately, I was obliged
to make one exception, for the Pied Rock-Thrushes, male and
female, became so quarrelsome as they threw off their winter
clothes and donned their nuptial robes (a little point in natural
history which is ignored by theorists) that I had to locate the most
forward pair in the Larks' aviary. They did not interfere much
with the female ; but almost every time the female Rock-Thrush
came off her nest she went for the male Lark. In the open, the
Lark would have made off, but in the aviary he hadn't a chance ;
for minutes at a time she would viciously pursue him ; and the
poor creature so knocked himself about against the roof of the
aviary that my hopes of his breeding fell very low indeed.
Happily she became more quiet or otherwise occupied when her
3^oung were hatched ; and I cleared them out of the avia^ a few
hours before the young Larks were supposed to be due to appear.
Very early in the spring I had noticed that the female
Lark had commenced to work out a hollow, at the extreme end
of the aviar3% under the stem of a Virginia creeper. I may here
mention that, when at work, the female (for the lazy male,
imitating his masters, was above work ; but he was not above
seeing his wife work) seemed never to use her feet ; she
invariably worked with her bill, moving it masterfully, right and.
left; but when taking a dust bath she would scratch like a
common fowl. On May 21st, the female commenced carrying
mouthfuls of the shortest obtainable ha3^ in the direction of the
nest; on the 25th she was still busy, and still carried a little on

might not sit on the zinc ; and, curiously enough, both this bird
(for her first nest) and the Rock-Thrush used only this soiled
hay for their respective nests. Watching from a window of the
house, I was able to see her fly down with this hay, but nothing
more. It transpired afterwards that six eggs were laid ; and she
seems to have commenced sitting with the first; and the first-
born of the four was perhaps six days older than the youngest.
The female Lark sat very timidly, instantly leaving the
nest (first running some yards, then flying) if the handle of the
house-door, which opened into the adjoining aviary, were but
touched. There was one curious difference between this species
and the Rock-Thrush. The male Rock-Thrush, with a meal-
worm in his bill, would sit like a lump for any length of time if
he could detect the slightest sign of my presence at any of the
windows, and it was weary work watching him ; but the Lark
seldom, if ever, although so wary, detected me through the glass.
On June 15th, creeping on all-fours beneath the thick foliage, I
paid my first visit to the nest. It was not where I had supposed.
The thickening foliage had driven the Lark away to the most
open (overhead) spot she could find at the back of the garden.
Observing the nest-hole under the wall to have been deserted,
for a moment I was nonplused, when I suddenly found the
young under my nose. I counted them carefully, only three
heads were visible, and these three heads with their three
corresponding bodies were thickly coated with exceptionally
long down of a light yellow, or yellow-buff, colour. Now that I
knew where to look for the nest, I found I could get a distant
peep at it from the feeding-place ; and as the lump of yellow
down swelled above the level of the ground, when attending to
the food and water, I could daily form an idea as to how matters
were progressing.
On June 22nd, the female commenced building another
nest. On the first day she carried only lumps of earth :--If I
ever had any doubts as to the power of a bird to cany its eggs or
anything else, they were dispelled by the sight of the ease with
which this bird carried really large lumps ot earth to her nest.
After depositing each lump in the nest-hole, which presumably
had been excavated before I was up, she proceeded to work at it
with her chest, moving her body right and left. Disgusted with
the thick foliage, this second nest was built in the front of the
aviary, and could be watched from the house.
To return to the young birds :--On June 23rd, the nest was
chock full, the first-born sprawling as usual over the others ;
but on the following day there remained but one lialf-fledged

creature, looking the picture of misery. Later in the day I saw
two youngsters hopping (they could not walk until some days
later) after their mother, and by accident they found the new
nest and instantly flopped into it, and made it their head-quarters
for some two hours, floundering about, and hopelessly marring
their mother's schemes of concealment. Afterwards they
hopped about all over the place, rushing to their mother for food ;
and later I observed a third. But the mother repaired and took
to her nest ; and on the evening of the 25th the three young
looked neglected and very miserable. On the 26th, the piteous
cry of one of the young birds, No. 3 in order of age, nearly
broke my heart it had been entirely deserted. I made a
search, and found the dead body of a No. 4, evidently the one I
had seen alone in the nest. It was now lying about two feet
from the nest, or perhaps a little more, and probably had been
carried to the place where I had found it, and then had been
deserted as too young to follow for food. No. 3 I took into the
house, but did not succeed in rearing it. The sitting mother
came off her nest from time to time to feed Nos. 1 and 2, who
settled themselves down in the neighbourhood of the uest, and
darted after her the instant she came off. Eventually No. 2 died
a few hours after a thunderstorm, apparently from inflammation,
and No. 1 alone survives,
The only peculiarity about the nests was their depth, and
steep coffee-cup sides.
According to the Royal Natural History, " the female lays
four eggs, bluish in colour and spotted with yellow." I11 the
first nest, there were four young birds ; and I found two eggs,
one near the place to which the female carried the excreta, and
the other in the same direction but not carried so far. I am
reasonably satisfied that these eggs had been laid in the nest, and
had been removed by the female. Only two eggs were laid in
the second nest; but I picked up a third on the 13th July, in
the spot whither the female often retreated when disurbed. At
a very early stage of the second nest I had noticed the prema-
ture rejection of the male by the female, which was followed by
the sudden desertion of the nest ; this splendid bird had taken
a chill, and, to my great sorrow, died during the night of July
12th-13th.
I cannot make my eggs agree with the description
mentioned above. The ground is a pale gray-white; and they
are blotched all over with pale or gray-brown. At the thick end,
the " spots" run more into one another than over the rest of the

egg. Some of the eggs have darker and more decidedly brown
spots than the others.
The female did all the work of nest-making, incubating,
and feeding and attending upon the young. More than once the
male savagely attacked the young birds; and I cannot place to
his credit a single certain instance of his having fed them.
During the whole of the spring and nesting-season, he had been
my great delight ; and I am grievously disappointed that he
should have turned out to be such a selfish character. From
early morn till late in the evening he used to sing and posture
incessantly : it was one continuous, never-ending warble. The
song was neither powerful nor beautiful, but it was very varied
and highly pleasing. So long as the growth of grass and wheat
was sufficiently short to allow him to keep to the ground, he was
perpetually on the trot with a cocked-up tail. Should he chance
to meet his mate, he instantly commenced to dance and caper.
He had a true love dance ; and with high arched neck would
prance and skip right merrily. Before the eggs were hatched,
however, he was driven off the ground, and thenceforth spent
most of his time on the roof of a shed, slightly under four feet
high and overlooking the second nest. Here he went on with
his warbling, the tail jerking up and down with the stiffness of
a wooden toy, and here also he would dance if joined by the
female even for a moment. For a while I could not understand
some of their courting postures, until I found that they copulated
in the air. Perhaps this is not uncommon with Larks, but I do
not know. It came as a surprise to me. When the female was
not very amiable, he would charge at her again and again until
he forced her into flight. When she became more affectionate,
however, it was a pretty sight to watch them. Standing up at
his full height, some two feet from her, with wings and tail
spread out to their full extent, with quivering, shimmering wings
he would slowly approach her. If very loveable, she would rise
and meet him likewise with outspread wings. The male Black
Lark evidently glories in his black, as the courting Golden-
winged Woodpecker glories in his golden, underparts, for not
only did he disport himself as described when actually with the
female on the shed, but, from the nearest edge of the shed, he
would stand over her, as it were, with outstretched quivering
wings, while she was sitting on her second nest.
So long as the Rock-Thrushes were in the aviary, the male
clearly understood that he had a duty to perform, and regularly
patrolled in the front, charging furiously at every bird that came
to the ground, including the male Rock-Thrush. When the

female Rock-Thrush came to the ground, he would crouch down,
keeping his head always towards her, and would execute various
strategical movements to the rear until he was able to manoeuvre
himself altogether out of her neighbourhood. From the moment
that he realised that the Rock-Thrushes had really gone, he
ceased to keep guard, feeling that there was no longer a foe
worthy of his steel. Thenceforward, and up to the actual day
on which the female died, he gave himself up to warbling and
posturing ; but, since, he has been mute, and keeps almost
entirely on the ground along with his child, with whom he is
now quite friendly.
As regards the plumage of these birds, the female may be
briefly described as of a light sandy-buff much speckled with
darker.
The male, in winter plumage, is nominally like the female ;
but my male lias always shewn a much darker plumage, with
appareutty black primaries. His only moult is in the autumn.
According to the Br. Museum Catalogue,--" In winter plumage
the male is black, but the whole of the feathers are obscured by
broad edgings of sandy colour. By the wearing off of these
margins the full black plumage is attained." This is doubtless
substantially correct; but I am not quite satisfied that it accounts
for all the changes I have noticed. The same authority says of
the young, which one might suppose would have been like
the female,-- " Mottled like all young Barks, and especially
resembling a Shore-Lark, but blackish on the head and back.'"
My young birds had no juvenile mottling ; if they are to be
described as mottled, so must the parents, especially the mother.
Numbering them according to age, of No. 4 I can only saj^ that
it was blackish and without mottles ; it was very juvenile, and
the reverse of savory when picked up, and was promptly
cremated. Of the three elder, as they trotted about, No. 1 was
alwa}^s lighter than the others, while the other two were exactly
alike. Presumably they were a female and two males. Nos. 2
and 3, when in a squatting position, seemed to be wholly black
above, with a conspicuous sandy superciliary streak. On close
examination, however, it appeared that most of the feathers had a
faint edging round the tips of sandy ; whilst those round the neck,
on the chest, and especially on the wings, were more or less
edged with the same colour; but the lower breast, abdomen, and
vent were of a dead sooty black without a trace of lighter. As
No. 1 developed, the sandj^ tips seemed to grow and hide the black ;
but she remains distinctly darker than the old female. At one
period, a bold line of sandy ran up from the bill to about the

centre of the crown ; and this line, and the superciliary streaks,
formed very conspicuous marks on the blackish ground. On
July 15th, I found the young bird on one of the sheds for the
first time, and, at a distance of about four feet, made the
following notes :--The superciliary streaks, although still very
conspicuous, seemed inclined to spread ; the central streak had
dispersed, and formed a cluster of sandy spots on the crown ; a
new sandy streak started on each side from the corner of the
mouth, passed well below the eye, but curved upwards close
behind it and almost joined the superciliary streak, giving the
face a curious but not pretty expression ; the back of the head,
nape, and cheeks were spotless and of a deep brown colour,
almost black. Something like a circle of sandy still appeared
round the neck. Back brown, each feather being edged with
sandy ; shoulders similar, but strongly inclined to be spotty.
Secondaries broadly edged with sandy ; primaries as folded,
almost entirely brown, but a little lighter along the edge of the
wing. Chest white sandy, spotted with darker. Tail brown,
laterally edged with light sandy. I never noticed the latter on
the mother during her life, but found afterwards that the whole
of the outer feather on each side was very light sandy, and also
the edge of the outer web of the second feather. I11 the young
bird, this light edging down the sides of the tail is often con-
spicuous as she runs about, but I do not notice it in the male.
The tail was forked. Although still inclined to darker, the black
has practically disappeared. Where has it gone to, and how
came the young to be so very black? I have never studied colour
feeding, but cannot refrain from suggesting that the unnatural
feeding of these young birds may have caused an unusual flow of
latent black pigment. The mealworms were stopped as soon as
possible ; and the blackness in the survivor has subsided or been
absorbed. I am inclined to think that the male obtains some of
his colouring from a flow of pigment in the spring. On the
other hand, as a protective colouring for the young, the black
must be valuable; for the three tots, as broad as they were long,
when squatting about, looked remarkably like cattle droppings ;
and when one would raise his head in the long grass, the thick
bunch of sandy down on the eyebrows, not far off an inch long,
gave the black urchin such a venomous-reptile and generally
uncanny appearance as would hinder many a foe from approach-
ing too near.
As regards the survivor, she and her mother were devoted
to one another ; and, as she frisked and skipped around her in
youthful glee, I felt inclined to frisk and skip myself, and to

THE NESTING OF THE PENNANT,

<bodyText confidence="0.978138818181818" page_id="32638552"  page_num="Page 176" year="" vol="">
By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
I am sometimes afraid that members of our Society will
weary of my frequent signatures over articles sent in ; but I
cannot help my birds doing so well ; so with this brief apology,
I will begin again.
I may perhaps be permitted, before commencing my story,
to refer my readers back to a paper I wrote last } r ear on the " Sex
of Pennants." I then pointed out that there is no possibilit}&apos; of
mistaking a cock and hen Pennant.
The cock has a crimson head extending right over the
cheeks and neck ; the hen has her head of an orangy-reddish
tint. But leaving out, for fear of wearying my readers, many
other points to which I then drew attention--the absolutely
certain way of telling a hen is by her tail. In the hen Pennant
the centre feathers are gree?i ; in the cock they are rich violet.
I refer to this point because Mr. Fillmer saw fit to put
in, what I considered under the circumstances, a most (shall we
call it ?) impolite footnote to my article :--
" We do not hold ourselves responsible for any of the
opinions or facts stated in this article. The same applies to all
articles published in this Magazine ; but we wish it to be clearly
understood in this case, as our personal feeling is that Mr.
Farrar's conclusions require to be confirmed by the observation
of other specimens, besides the pair he writes about, before they
can be accepted.--E d."
I said nothing at the time ( a ), but, thinks I, we will bide
our time, and "all things come to him that waits." These
things have come to me. My Pennants have bred, and it is not
the same hen I wrote about then, but a new one ; and she has,
mirabile dictu, the same signs of sex as her predecessor! So even
Editors may live and learn.
( a) This is scarcely correct--Mr. Farrar said a good deal, in correspondence with
is.--E d.

I should like here to say that the Editor may in future rest
quite easy that I do not say what I cannot prove. Not only is
the old hen Pennant marked as I say, but in the nest of young
ones, of which there are five, two have green tail centres and three
have blue : hence there are three cocks and two hens. If anyone
will in future look at a lot of Pennants, they will see that it is as
I say, and that it is quite easy to distinguish the Sex of Pennants.
So much for my own defence--for even the worm will turn if
you tread hard enough.
I might say that if the British Museum Catalogue gives
one description alone of the adult plumage, as Mr. Seth-Smith
says, the sooner the authorities alter the description the better it
will be for accuracy.
They began nesting operations sometime in May : the
cock diligently feeding the hen being the first sign of good
things to come. When pairing, the cock makes a terrible noise,
something like the barking of a dog, and he also gives a pretty
whistle from time to time. If the hen is not ready to mate,
should her lord prove too demonstrative, she runs at him along
the perch, head down, and pretends to bite his leg savagely;
when he sheers off quickly.
One night, by the look of the hen, I knew eggs were not
far off, and the next morning there was an egg laid on the floor,
through inexperience. Thinks I, this will not do, my lady; so
I popped the egg into her log and awaited issues. Next day she
took the hint and laid her egg, like a well-regulated bird, beside
the other in the nest. Altogether, five were deposited ; but at
first she did not sit very closely, and caused me thereby much
mental anguish. However, she apparently knew her business
better than I did, and what Pennants' eggs required by way of
heat--for every egg hatched out in due course : about twenty
days, as far as I could guess, for it is impossible to tell such things
to a day, unless you are idiot enough to interfere, and I am
not. The first I knew of the hatching out, was the noise the
youngsters made. Day by day it grew, to my great joy, and at
first resembled the barking in miniature of a pack of hounds,
but gradually the voices changed to the whistle of the adults,
and then to a hoarse grumbling noise.
Both parents worked early and late ; and well they might,
to feed those five hungry mouths, and to their credit they have
reared ever}&apos; one. One curious thing I noticed, that, when the
old cock was going to feed, when the youngsters were small, he
used to put his beak down on the perch and bring up the food
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.999753" page_id="32638554"  page_num="Page 178" year="" vol="">

repeatedly into his mouth, perhaps for five minutes at a time;
and then off he would fly to the nest, as much as to say, " I
think the feeding bottle will do now."
The hen brooded her young closely for about four days ;
afterwards she only stayed in the nest at night. Too hot I
expect !
The young ones are all out. but are being fed by the
parents. They have yellow beaks ; the hens onl} r a carmine crown
on the top of their heads, followed by sage green ; backs sage
green with dull black centres ; tails of hens tipped with white
and green centres ; cocks' tails blue where the hens' are green.
The young hens have much more green on the necks and sides
than the young cocks. Size, when they first came out, about
that of a big Rosella. They are now, August 21st, nearly as big
as their parents.
I have looked carefully through all books I know of, and,
so far as I can see, this is the first authentic account of rearing
Pennants. I paj^ no attention to vague general statements.
I might say that my Pennants dote on mealworms, and
eat them like shrimps, held in one claw. It may be nice for the
Pennant, but I should think decidedly nastj^ for the mealworm.
We have printed the above article exactly as received from the writer--and are quite
content to leave the point at issue to the good sense of our readers. It is possible that
Mr. Farrar has discovered a sexual distinction which escaped the notice of Gould,
Salvadori, and other ornithologists, and which the many aviculturists who have kept
Pennants for years have also failed to observe--but we do not consider that he has at
present proved this. We shall keep an open mind on the point until Mr. Farrar's
conclusions are confirmed or disproved by other observers. If such a very marked
difference in colouring in the sexes actually exists in all examples, it is passing strange
that it has not been noticed before, and that the series of skins at the British Museum fails
to shew it. We should be glad if members who keep Pennants, of which they know the
sex, would carefully examine their plumage in the light of Mr. Farrar's remarks and
communicate the result to us for publication.--E d.
Everyone who has had any experience of the Pennant Parrakeet (either living in
its native haunts, in captivity in Plurope, or dead in Museums) has unhesitatingly
described the sexes as alike; but Mr. Farrar, having apparently secured one or two
females of the closely allied species Platycercus adelaidee, and paired them successfully
with P. pennanti, has felt it his duty to set everybody right. The Adelaide Broadtail
is so closely related to Pennant's Broadtail, that it would be quite remarkable if they
refused to interbreed. When races interbreed, examples resembling each parent are
quite likely to be reproduced by them. The young of typical Pennants are described as
being entirely green. Breeding Pennants has been repeatedly done in Germany, but
rearing the young has only been occasionally successful : nevertheless this has occurred.--

REVIEW.
" Foreign Bird Keeping ," by Arthur G. Butler , Ph.D., F.L.S.,

appeared in the Feathered World.

Readers of the Aviculiural Magazine do not require
any introduction to Dr. Butler as an author, and in this unpre-
tentious"book they will once more appreciate the accuracy and
thoroughness by which his writings are always distinguished.
After a chapter on "Aviaries and Management," Dr. Butler
gives an account, first of some of the more frequently imported
soft-food species, and afterwards of the finches and finch-like
birds. Only between 20 and 30 insectivorous species are treated
of, but of the small seed-eaters a very much larger number are
described. It will doubtless be read with interest by those who
have not already perused it in the Feathered World , and it will be
handy to beginners as a book of reference.
We should have expected to find the important subject of
food more fully discussed in a work of this kind. With regard
to the feeding of soft-food birds, Dr. Butler's views are well
known, and are, of course, re-stated in " Foreign Bird Keeping."
Dr. Butler's method of treatment does not commend itself to
the present writer.
It appears to us that in several instances Dr. Butler
generalises too much, and draws conclusions as to the character
of a species from too limited experience--but this is the fault of
all writers on aviculture, and one which it is almost impossible
to avoid.
There are numerous illustrations, some by the author and
some by Mr. Lydon.

CORRESPONDENCE.
THE SPOTTED PANTHER-BIRD.
Sir,--I wonder if any of our members know whether the Spotted
Pardalote (Pardalotuspunctatus) (Gonld) or its congener, the Allied Pardalote
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.997585466666667" page_id="32638555"  page_num="Page 179" year="" vol="">
(P. affinis), have been imported and kept in confinement in this country. It
seems to me that they might be kept quite as easily as many other birds
which are now regularly offered for sale, and more beautiful creatures it
would be difficult to imagine.
In case the birds are not generally known, I enclose a drawing of the
Spotted Pardalote made from specimens collected by myself in Australia.
They are fairly common in the North of Victoria, and South-West of New
South Wales. I do not know much of their habits, but imagine their food
consists of various seeds and small insects. As far as I know, the sexes are
alike, as all the specimens I obtained resemble one another.
The Allied Pardalote is a little larger than the Spotted variety (the
drawing is life-size) and has the markings more in the form of streaks than
spots. The mark over the ey r e runs completely over the base of the upper
mandible, and is cadmium-yellow in front and white behind. The beak is
greyish olive without markings, and the upper tail-coverts warm olive-brown

instead of crimson. The wings have, in place of spots, the feathers
margined with white, and the bastard wing is decorated with brilliant
scarlet. The under parts are greyer than in its Spotted relative, but in
other respects its colouring and markings are not dissimilar.
I have only seen these birds mentioned in Gould's " Birds of Australia,"
but that may merely be ignorance on my part. It seems a pity, however,
that they are not better known, and I, for one, should be delighted to obtain
some living specimens. Norman B. Roberts.
The following answer has been sent to Mr. Roberts :--
The Spotted Pardalote was imported by Mr. J. Abrahams in 1882, and
he forwarded a pair to Dr. Russ; but unfortunately they arrived dead. The
allied Panther-bird has, I believe, never been imported. Our Zoological
Society has never owned examples of any species of Pardalotus.
There is no reason why these pretty little birds should not be kept
quite as easily as Tits, which they resemble in their actions, habits and food.
They build domed nests in holes, either in trees or in the earth ; lay white
eggs, and feed upon seeds, buds, and insects.
What do you wish done with your charming coloured drawing? It is
quite fit for publication. A. G. Butter.

Sir,-- Dr. Butler is undoubtedly correct in stating that the cock
Nonpareil does not change colour in winter, at all events not invariably.
For five years I have kept one in an open aviary, and, beyond so much of a
duller tone as may be caused by the natural wear of the feathers at the end
of the season, he undergoes absolutely no change of colour. I may say,
however, that so experienced an aviculturist as Mr. Abrahams differs from
me on this point: he has observed that birds under his care lose the bright
blue on the head, while the red breast assumes a yellow tinge in the winter.
Possibly individuals may vary in this particular.
In May, 1896, I purchased two hen Nonpareils, which I selected out
of a cageful of two or three dozen ; these I placed with my cock bird and
have twice had nests and eggs, but without further result. The Nonpareil
is decidedly a shy and timid bird, probably requiring ample space or freedom
from the disturbing influence of other birds, to breed successfully. I fancy
too much is made of the insectivorous habits of this species. At one time
I supplied them rather freely with caterpillars and mealworms, but I have
ceased doing so for some years with no ill results : in fact they are, if
anything, more disposed to nest now than before. Of course, in an open
air aviary birds are able to obtain a fair proportion of insects for themselves.
The Dhyae.-- "Quarrelsome" is almost too mild an epithet to apply
to this otherwise charming species. My bird possesses an absolutely
demoniacal temper. His aviary companions are rather too large to be
trifled with, and he therefore considers it safer to vent his spleen on his less
formidable owner. The moment I open the door of his aviary, he descends
on me with the utmost fury, usually attacking my hands with all the force
he can put into his beak, and frequently succeeding in drawing blood ; at
times he alights on my shoulders, digging his beak into my neck, or, if in
an unusually good humour, merely attempting to pull out my hair. At one
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.999188384615385" page_id="32638557"  page_num="Page 181" year="" vol="">
time, I had a Shamah who also was of opinion that I was meant to be eaten,
but he was mildness itself compared with the Dhyal.
For the past two seasons a cock Red-lieaded Bunting ( Emberiza luteola)
and a hen Saffron Finch, in one of niv outdoor aviaries, have paired, built a
nest in a box and laid eggs; these, I suppose, could hardly be expected to
prove fertile, at all events, they have never hatched.
I have noticed, lately, a number of the Japanese Bunting ( E. rutila)
at a bird shop; it seems to be seldom imported. I had for some years a pair
given me by the late Mr. Allon, which he received, I think, from Germany.
They are handsome birds : the cock bright chestnut above and yellow
beneath, with a brown patch on the throat; the hen is generally pale and
without the throat patch. Their disposition is rather timid, but they are
very hardy. The cock has a bright little song, which is, however, not very
noticeable.
I do not remember to have noticed any remarks on the North
American White-throated Song Sparrow {Zonotrichia albicollis) in the pages
of the Magazine, and conclude that it is a rare bird in captivity. A pair has
been in my collection since November, 1897. During the first winter they
resided in an indoor aviary ; in the following spring they were removed to
outdoor quarters, where they have since remained. In disposition this
species is shy and retiring, the hen especially so, taking the shortest
possible flights and quickly taking refuge under cover when observed.
Through the spring and summer months, the exceedingly high-pitched and
reiterated notes of the cock are almost incessant during the day and even
frequent at night; the hen also sings at times, but her short and scrappy
song is more of a Bunting character, though loud and harsh. I have never
noticed these birds to be at all pugnacious, as might perhaps have been
expected.
The Diuca is another bird that sings freely at night, especially when
the moon is shining brightly. W. H. Hudson, in " Idle Days in Patagonia,"
writes very enthusiatically of the song of this bird, and it is certainly
bright and cheerful; but, as rendered in captivity, I think this is about as
much as can be said for it; in the silence of night, however, it can be heard
distinctly at a considerable distance. This species does not seem to be as
hardv as one would expect--a pair I attempted to winter in the open,
succumbed to the inclemency of the season. In a moderately heated aviary
it gives no trouble, and, if afforded plenty of space, would probably breed
freely. My birds once nested, but the eggs were thrown out and broken
when on the point of hatching.
The moulting of the Avadavat has always been rather a puzzle to me.
My birds are kept indoors. I have, unfortunately, never taken any notes on
the subject, and cannot, therefore, speak precisely, but roughly I should say
Mr. Page's dates are about usual. The puzzling part, however, is that,
besides the more or less regular yearly moult, there are various and frequent
subsidiary changes of colour. I shall endeavour, in future, to make more
accurate observations on this interesting subject.
Whilst referring to colour changes, I should like to record an
observation on the assumption of colour in the genus Pyromelana. This
spring I had occasion to catch an Orange Bishop, at the time when the
change was commencing. While handling the bird, I noticed that the red
feathers on the head were a palpably fresh growth and not, as is generally
believed, merely a change in the colour of the old feathers.

I have had as little success in breeding this year as Mr. Savage. Some
half-dozen Zebra Finches are all I can boast of, though I have had plenty of
other nests but not a single hatch. Green Cardinals have three times built
and laid eggs; in previous years they have regularly hatched out and then
killed and cast out their young; this year they have more humanely cast
forth the eggs instead. R. A. Todd.
BREEDING RESULTS.
Sir, --In the hope that other members may be induced to give their
experiences of the breeding season just closing, I give a few notes of what
has occurred here.
A pair of Parrot-finches reared a brood of four fine young, the nest-
lings leaving the nest-box the first week in July 7 . The red feathers are now
being gradually assumed. A pair of Black-headed Gouldian Finches, bred
by a friend last Autumn, are now sitting in a box suspended in the outer
portion of their aviary. My Long-tailed Grassfinches nested, but the eggs
proved unfertile, or the young perished at an early stage. The pair are now
going to nest again.
Several nests have been made during the Summer by the Cordon-bleus,
of which I have had three pairs in perfect condition for two years; but, for
various reasons, there were no results till last week, when, from a nest
cleverly fitted into an angle of the roof under a gutter, a brood flew.
Unluckily, the youngsters were not expected so soon, and no precautions
were taken for their safety; with the result that one of my Rollers was seen
the first thing one morning with a young Cordon-bleu in his bill, beating
its life out against a perch. Of course, the Rollers were at once shut off,
and now there is one remaining Cordon-bleu flying about and doing well.
The dead nestling showed a blue wart in the angle of the mouth each side,
and on the palate three dark spots, reminding me of the moutli-decoration
of the Gouldian Finches described in the Magazine last Autumn by
Dr. Butler.
I was anxious to give every chance to the Rollers, which at one time
appeared likely 7 to breed ; and no doubt the small birds confined with them,
though quite accustomed to the larger birds as a rule, were disturbed by the
Rollers' restlessness at times, and I know several nests were forsaken from
this cause. Of this pair of Rollers, the male was very anxious to nest, and
was continually going in and out of a hollow log. He is very 7 tame and
impudent, and, in the Spring, when I went into his aviary, he would fly 7 on
to my head ; and if I put up my hand to push him off, he would retaliate
with digs of his powerful bill. The hen bird was timid, and as she declined
the dainties offered by 7 her mate, he used to come to me, and try to push the
mealworm, or black-beetle, under my 7 collar, or into the folds of my cap.
Finding his mate indifferent, he became aggressive, and for some weeks she
was rather seriously persecuted. Since the Summer moult commenced, I
am glad to say that he has become more gentle towards her, and I may 7 have
more success another Spring, for the hen is much less shy than she was.
To the Rollers, at any rate to the very tame one referred to, I must
attribute the loss of the first brood of Chinese Painted Quail. The Rollers
had, up to the time of the hatching of the Quail, shown no signs of
hostility towards the smallest of their companions; but the sight of the

poor little chicks was too much for the Rollers, and several were seen to be
swallowed, only two being rescued, and subsequently reared.
My Diamond Doves have just reared a young one, the newly-hatched
young of a previous nest having been destroyed by some Rock Thrushes.
A pair of Scops Owls nested in a log; but they were not at that time in
the excellent condition of those described in the last number by Mr.
Meade-Waldo, and the eggs came to nothing.
My Pin-tailed Sand-Grouse laid several clutches of their beautiful
eggs, and in one case three were hatched ; but they were very weak from
the first, and after a few days died. The Black-bellied Sand-Grouse also
laid several clutches, but declined to sit. Of larger birds, we have a young
Snowy Owl, and four young Eider Ducks, two of them now full-grown.
W. H. ST. QuinTin.
THE ORANGE-WINGED AMAZON.
I once possessed, for a few weeks or months, an example of this
species (Chrysotis amazonica). The bird had been in the possession of
acquaintances of mine for about three years, and was given to me by them.
It never said anything beyond " Polly," which was uttered fairly distinctly ;
was by no means tame ; and seemed lacking in intelligence. While in the
cage in which it had lived at its old home, it had the habit of turning a
somersault under its perch, and uttering at the same time an ear-piercing
imitation of the sound of a rusty pump--when transferred to a different
cage it abandoned this habit, but returned to it on going back to the old
cage.
In appearance this species is much like the Blue-fronted -- so much so
that an inexperienced person might confuse them. It is, I think, larger
than the Blue-fronted, and of a gaunter and much less pleasing appearance.
The expression of the bird being somewhat forbidding, while the Blue-
fronted is amiable-looking.
I soon got rid of my specimen, as I did not take to it.
Horatio R. Fiu.mer.
THE AGE OF CAGE-BIRDS.
Sir, -- M} r experience is that birds live comfortably and happily for
many years in cages, if properly treated.
My niece has a Lizard Canary, a cock, which her brother brought
to her in December, 1889. It was given to him by a friend who had had it
for two years, so it must be nearly twelve years old. Here it lives in a cage
36 inches long, 26 inches high, and 19 inches wide. It alwaj^s has plenty of
river sand on the floor of its cage, and every variety of food that is good for
it. It is very cheerful, and sang merrily all the spring.
In the same cage are two other birds--a Red Cardinal and an
American Sparrow, hens -- both of which have been here since November,
1892, which makes them just seven years old.

THE CHINESE BULBUL.
Pycnonotus sinensis.
By A. G. Butler, Ph.D.
This is rather a pretty bird, mostly ashy and olive-
yellowish above ; brownish, yellow and white below; the head
and neck may be roughly described as black and brown with
conspicuous white patches on crown, sides of head and throat;
the wing and tail feathers dark brown edged with yellow.
I have been unable to come across any notes on the
nesting habits of this Bulbul, yet it must be a tolerably widely
distributed and common species : there has been a fair number
in the market this year, and I secured a healthy example on
June 8th which I still possess: I feed it upon my soft mixture,
orange, banana, and mealworms.
Dr. Russ seems to have been unacquainted with this bird
when he published his Handbook in 1887, but it is included in
volume II. of his larger work " Die fremdlandischen Weich-
futterfresser," published during the present year: he quotes
the following short note on its habits from Pere David. " The
bird is abundantly distributed over the whole south of China up
to the neighbourhood of the river Nautsekiang. It is evidently
a very gentle and tame bird, which one sees throughout the
year in the gardens at Shanghai, but never in the woods or in the
mountains. It confines itself continually to cultivated country
where berries and insects are never lacking to it. Sitting upon
the top of a bamboo or tree it gives voice to a deep, tolerably
pleasant sounding, but little varied song."
Dr. Russ speaks of having received this species hap-
hazard : he says that " when chasing its mate, it hops round her
either 011 branches or the ground with highly erected crest and
nape feathers, drooping wings and fan-like tail, it indeed appears
to be white-headed ; but then it puffs out its entire plumage, so
that it seems considerably larger than it actually is. Now it gets

out of the way of no other bird, even though it be the largest
and most powerful inhabitant of the bird-room, moreover I have
noticed that even the much larger Cassiques or Starling-like
birds and Military-Starlings avoid quarrelling with it. Indeed
they by no means attacked it, but invariably got out of its way.
All other birds, equally large or small it drove from its vicinity
or chased them away. It was only malicious to its red-cheeked
relatives."
Dr. Russ' pair went to nest in 1893, but the first nest was
destroyed through the interference of a Porto Rico Pigeon
(Columba squamosa ) ; indeed he says he lost two broods from
this cause. Eventually the hen Pigeon died and he took the
cock out, so now he says he hopes to have satisfactory results.
It appears that Mr. Eangheinz owned a remarkably tame
specimen of this Bulbul, which would alight on the food-basin
whilst still in his hand and would not even leave the banquet
when he touched it with his finger and strove to push it away.
" Whoever then can give the time to it will soon be able to make
this Bulbul finger-tame."
My own experience of the Chinese Bulbul is---that it is
the most nervous and least confiding species that I have hitherto
owned ; which clearly proves that it is quite impossible to decide
as to the temperament of a species from the study of one
individual: however, since my example was purchased it has
become a little quieter, and does not invariably rattle all over
the cage when I give it fresh food.
The song is short, rapid, but rather brilliant, with a
distindt sound of high piano-notes in it ; the length and
character of it may perhaps be expressed by the following--
Tiddle tend, tiddle tiddle terut, uttered as quickly as possible :
it seldom varies much.
THE BLUE-FRONTED AMAZON.
By Reginald Phieeipps.
The best talking Parrot that I ever myself came across
was a Blue-fronted Amazon, in one of Mr. J. Abrahams' private
rooms. All its natural notes had been obliterated, or at any
rate suppressed ; and the bird kept up a constant flow of plainly-
spoken sentences and well-sung songs. At a meeting of the old
Cage Bird Club, I referred to this Parrot ; and another member
present stated that the best talker he had ever met with likewise
was a Blue-fronted Amazon.

My own experience with this species is that, when young,
it learns quickly, but that it forgets a great deal after a time, and
that, as it grows older, its powers of learning seem to fail.
For many years a male of this species, belonging to my
sou, was in my charge. He learned a few things well and more
imperfectly. His laughter was always a pleasure to listen to ;
and his "Shake a paw," as he raised his right foot and clasped
one's extended finger, was, and still is, perfect. He picked up
from me "You old Fool" practically straight away, and for
some time revelled in the sentence, playing on the word " Fool "
with great emphasis and satisfaction. On one occasion, he was
on a long perch in the garden aviary when I brought in a lady
to see the birds. With bristling feathers, excitedly hurrying
backwards and forwards, he instantly struck up "You old Fool;
Fool ; Fool ; you old Fool," never stopping for a moment
until the lady, greatly offended, and regarding it as a personal
affront, abruptly withdrew into the house.
At one time, in my dining-room, where Polly was kept, I
had a Blue-cheeked Barbet. Anyone who has kept the male of
this species will be acquainted with its curious water-bubbling
note. Polly quickly picked it up, and, although this was many
years ago, still uses it as one of his favourite calls. Having
learned it, he came to regard it as his own ; and when the
Barbet uttered his own call Polty would go mad with rage,
thinking he was being mocked, and almost frantic in his
endeavours to get at him.
Polly could be terribly cruel. One day I carried him into
the garden, when he espied in a dark corner, well out of my
reach, a Scops Owl. I had forgotten, for the moment, that the
male was not in hiding as usual, but was keeping guard just
outside the nest on which the female was sitting. I heard Polly
utter a horrible chuckle, the import of which I knew well, and
at once realized the danger. I uttered a howl which might have
awakened the dead,--which Polly disregarded--and made a rush
for a long-handled net ; but it was too late. Polly gave but one
crunch ; and the poor little hero fell with a sickening thud, a
bloody shapeless mass ; the Parrot's long upper mandible had
entered the back, smashed up one of the shoulders into splints,
and laid open the vitals. This was one of a few occasions
which I have experienced in bird-keeping when I had to bottle
up my wrath veiy tightly^--for I could have torn Polly limb from
limb in my hot anger. Marvellous to relate, the Scops recovered,
fully recovered his health, but of course was never able to fly
again.

When in the garden, Polly did not by any means always
have his own way. He was universally detested ; and some of
the Jays and Pies played him many a pretty trick. The male
Struthidea, too, had a pleasing little way of suddenly pouncing
down upon him, and knocking him headlong from his perch.
But the Hunting Cissa was his pet aversion. The male
Cissa is a terrible scamp, and as cunning a rogue as may be
found in Asia. Polly is brought into the garden, and placed on
a long perch, and along the perch he trots ; but he suddenly
stops and looks nervously round, and finds that the Cissa has
suddenly appeared on the same perch behind him ; -- -but he is
looking the other way, and seems so innocent, that Polly trots on
again. He quickly stops, however, and looks anxiously back ;
but the Cissa, although certainly much nearer, is only indus-
triously wiping his bill. Again Polly trots off, but suddenly
stops short, for the Cissa, who is still wiping his bill, is now
close behind him. Polly is in a quandary ; if he turns once
more, he knows what is in store for him ; for the Cissa never lost
an opportunity of pulling Polly's tail, and this he would do with
no gentle tweak, but with a tug so vicious that Polty would yelp
like a toe-trodden puppy. So nervous did Polly become that,
eventually, when put out, he would at once fly into a sheltered
corner where he could not be attacked from behind, and there
he would stay until taken in again.
What with Polly's jealousy of, and madness towards,
some of the other birds, and his horrible and continuous
screaming when not being petted, he was voted a nuisance, and,
after some years, was handed over to a niece, who pays him
unremitting attention. Mr. Dutton refers to the uncertainty of
the temper of the Amazons. There is no such uncertainty about
Polly. His present owner hardly dares to let Polly out of his
cage because of the difficulty she experiences in getting him
back again, for Polly will be pretty certain to bite her if thwarted.
But to-da}% as in the past, Polly obeys 1113^ orders in a moment,
because he knows I am master. With the larger Parrots,
Cockatoos, Horses, and Sunday Scholars, if you are not master
you are nowhere. Teach them first and foremost to respect you,
and then you may shew kindness, but to begin with and to trust
to kindness, and kindness alone, is fatal. Of course these
remarks do not apply to timid birds, only to the savage and
strong, and to those who have sufficient reasoning powers to
know right from wrong.
Occasionally I pay Polly a visit ; and the moment my

voice is heard wild cries resound through the house, for I still
stand first in his affections. And when I open the cage-door
and he comes on to my hand,--with every feather on end, with
wings extended and tail outspread, quivering with excitement,
and talking and laughing away to his utmost capacity--it is
difficult to imagine a more attractive creature ; and I wonder
to myself how I ever could have hacl the heart to part with Polly.
Polly often " nested," and would certainly have bred with
me if he had had a mate.

DISTINCTION OF THE SEXES IN PENNANT PARRAKEETS.

[We have received a letter from Mr. Farrar in which he states (i) that
he has no Adelaide Parrakeets, either cocks or hens (2) that he knows the
difference between Adelaides and Pennants perfectly well (3) that all his
birds are common Pennants (.Platycercus elegans ). Unfortunately his letter
is worded in a needlessly aggressive wa}'--and we therefore consider it better
not to insert it.]
Sir,--I saw Mr. Farrar's Pennants not a fortnight ago, and I most
emphatically say that, in my opinion, there is no doubt whatever about
their being ordinary Pennants.
Does Dr. Butler imagine that Mr. Farrar does not know a Pennant
from an Adelaide ? The hen Pennant is quite easily distinguished from the
cock by the dull bricky-red of her colour; her small rounded head, and, as
Mr. Farrar says, absolutely certainly by her tail, the middle of which is green,
whereas, in the cock it is deep blue.
I saw Mr. Farrar's first hen Pennant, and though she was more
orangey-red in colour, she had the same shaped head and the same tail
colouring.
I have a hen Pennant, at present, identical with Mr. Farrar's No. 2
hen, and I know another member of the Society who has one also.
Young Pennants, moreover, are not " all green," as Dr. Butler asserts;
nor "all brown," as Mr. Gedney affirms; but marked precisely as Mr.
Farrar says in his recent article.
G. LE C. Grace.
Sir,--A s you invite notes on this subject, I should like to say a few
words on the matter.
In the first place, I may say that during the last six or seven years I
have had a dozen or more of these birds. I have three at present, one cock
and two hens--the cock is identical with Mr. Farrar's description of his
( v) The dispute is about the female in Mr. Farrar's possession--we believe the male is
admitted by all to be an ordinary Pennant Parrakeet. Will Mr. Oates tell us whether his
own hens shew the same difference from the cock (in plumage) as Mr. Farrar's does?-- Ed.

male bird (v), and I doubt very much whether Dr. Butler or any other
person ever saw an adult full-plumaged cock with centre tail-feathers green.
In addition to blue tail, you must look for a bold masculine head,
brilliant colour, and size.
On August 29th I had the pleasure of seeing the birds in question,
both young and old, and I consider them typical birds of P. elegans.
Would Dr. Butler sav whether the bird he calls Adelaide Broadtail is
identical with the Yellow-rumped Parrakeet illustrated and described by
Dr. Greene, in vol. II. p. 8 of " Parrots in Captivity " ? ( b)
F. W. Oates.
Sir,-- If I may venture to comment upon Mr. Farrar's letter,
published in the September number, about the colouring of the female
Pennant, I would say that I believe I possessed a true pair of these birds,
which I kept in 1113' outdoor aviaries for a year (I still have the male bird),
and the only difference I could discern between the male and the female
was that the latter had a smaller head, with an altogether feminine
appearance, when side by side with her mate. To a practised eye the
difference was decided. The colouring was the same, except that in the
female it was less brilliant.
I regret that she died, as also did a hen Crimson-wing about the
same time, whilst her mate (as in the case of the Pennant) still survives.
This is only too often the case.
I believe the foot-note of A. G. B. is, probably, quite correct, with
regard to Mr. P&apos;arrar's remarks. Do not all young Australian Parrakeets
resemble, for the most part, the adult female when the}&apos; leave the nest ?
It is not likely, if the Pennants bred in Mr. Farrar's aviary were pure, that
some would have green tail centres, and some blue. This fact seems to me
to show that the male and female are of different species, and that two have
taken after the mother, and three after the father (Platycercus adelaidce and
P. elegans respectively). Naturally, one would not like to state this as an
absolute surety, for, whatever one's experience, one can always be open to
correction.
May I be allowed, in all courtesy, to say that it seems a pity that
letters should be couched in a style which do not exactly assist an Editor
in the somewhat difficult task of correcting or offering his help in pointing
out mistakes on the part of the writers ? Neither do I think that Mr.
Fillmer's original comment upon Mr. Farrar's original letter about Pennants
was in the least ' impolite.' Mr. Fillmer's duty was to state what he believed
to be a wrong impression, and in that statement he took care to say that his
remarks were not aimed at Mr. Farrar personally, but would apply to all
articles published in the Magazine.
Readers of it would not weary of Mr. Farrar's articles on birds (as
such they are most interesting), but would they not soon grow weary of a
(3) Certainly not ; but that is probably the bird which Mr. Farrar takes for the
Adelaide Broadtail. The latter corresponds in every respect with Mr. Farrar's description
of his supposed female Pennants and is the only species which (in both sexes) answers to
his description of the hen. If Mr. Oates has birds so-coloured, and believes them to be
hen Pennants, I am afraid he will have to alter his opinion ; it is not probable that there
are two forms of female Pennants, one almost identical in every respect with the male, and
the other indistinguishable from the hen of the Adelaide Broadtail.--A. G. B.

tone of defiance towards tlie Editor, or towards anyone who ventures to
disagree with the writer ?
I hope that Mr. Farrar will not take umbrage at what I have, I trust
in courteous language, tried to say ; for I feel, and probably many others
with me, that courtesy* and not too much prominence given to ' thinks I,'
are two of the most advisable means for carrying on any&apos; correspondence in
a proper spirit.
In any&apos; case, whether the young Parrakeets bred by&apos; Mr. Farrar are
pure Pennants or not, it is a very interesting experience, and one decidedly
not to he kept in the background.
Hubert I). Asteey.
Sir,--S eeing in the letter of the Rev. C. D. Farrar that he is the first
to rear Pennant Parrakeets--I have bred about twenty in the last six years (c),
and have had hens breed freely that are bred in my&apos; outdoor unheated
garden-aviary&apos;; but all my birds, when in adult plumage, are identical. The
males are larger, have much flatter heads, and are more aggressive in the
Spring. I have had as many as six in one nest. I find they 7 so often die
after they 7 have left the nest about ten days. I have only one pair now. The
seed, etc., should be put where it is no trouble for them to find it.
This season I have bred three King Parrakeets. eight Peach-faced
Lovebirds, three Red-headed Rosellas, and several Budgerigars. My Red-
mantled Parrakeets had two young ones : they died when about two weeks
old.
Edwd. Le Heup Cocicsedge.
Sir,--I do not think that Mr. Farrar is right about Pennants. One
\0x25A0of mine has just died, and post mortem examination proved it to be a hen--
there was not a single green feather in her tail, and the only differences
from the male, that I could see, were that the head was smaller and the
plumage not quite so bright.
(Mrs.) M. B. Lancaster.
I have carefully examined the series of skins of the Pennant
Parrakeet (commonly 7 called Platycercus pennanti, but P. elegans in the Cat.
Birds Brit. Mus.) and of the Adelaide Parrakeet (P. adelaidce) at the British
Museum, in the company of Dr. Butler.
There are several skins of the first named which are marked as being
those of females, and these are distinguished from the rest by&apos; their smaller
size and slightly duller colour--but not, so far as I could see, by&apos; any such
differences of tint as are stated by 7 Mr. Farrar to exist in the case of his
Parrakeets.
If it be admitted that Mr. Pkirrar's female is a true example of
P, elegans, he is still as far off as ever from proving that all females of the
species differ from the male in the same wav as his does. Mr. Farrar's
female Parrakeet may be a Pennant, or it may be an Adelaide, or it may be
neither--I am not concerned to prove what it is. All I say about it is
simply this,--that if the hen in question differs from the male Pennant in

the manner and to the extent stated by Mr. Farrar, it is not a typical adult
specimen of P. elegant, and Mr. Farrar has not proved that such differences
are true sexual characteristics.
P. adelaidce agrees remarkably in many respects with Mr. Farrar's
description of the female. It differs from P. elegant in having the crimson
replaced by orange-red; the violet on the chin is much paler ; the feathers
on the back have traces of a colour which Mr. Farrar describes as that of
the strand Magazine ; the tail has a more decided greenish tint; the legs are
greyer. It therefore seems to me very probable that Dr. Butler's solution
of the difficulty may be the true one--but I do not pledge myself to that or
any other theory.
It is somewhat curious that in Mr. Farrar's article on "The Sex of
Pennants " he describes the centre tail feathers of the cock as "black"
(vol. iv. p. 108), while in his article on "The Nesting of the Pennant" he
calls them " rich violet " (page 176 of this vol.), and Mr. Grace and Mr.
Oates, in their letters printed above, describe the colour as " blue."

NOTES AND QUERIES.

<bodyText confidence="0.99941728125" page_id="32638567"  page_num="Page 191" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I hope you will excuse the casual nature of the present "Notes
and Queries," suggested by recent communications to our Magazine.
Shatnas, etc. I was much interested in Miss Alderson's account of her
birds ; her experience of this species tallies remarkably with mine in at
least two points. A male bird I kept some time by himself used to bask on
the floor with outspread wings, in just the way she describes, and like no
other bird I know. Also, when first put in a cage together with a hen, he
attacked and persecuted her furiously. Afterwards, when both were placed
in a much larger cage together, she turned the tables on him, and led him
such a life that I had to remove her altogether. I infer from this that, with
Shamas, a long and formal introduction is necessary if a pair are to agree,
and I think Miss Alderson is doing very right in keeping hers apart. The
Shama, like other members of the Thrush family, seems naturally un-
sociable even with the other sex of its own species, but even sociable
species may at times refuse to chum up at first. Some time ago, when
joint Secretary to the Zoo here, I introduced a hen Liothrix into a cage
where a bachelor male had long remained. He immediately made violent
love to her, showing off with his wings slightly- expanded and inclined
sideway-s, like some Pheasants, and breast rather puffed out--but she would
have nothing to do with him, either then or a long time after, though they
are as friendly as possible now, like their charming species as a rule. Does
Liothrix , by the way, always show off in this way ? This is the only
occasion on which I have ever seen it done, and I have kept several of both
sexes myself. Also, does the Hedge-Sparrow (Accentor modularis) which is
sometimes considered very nearly akin to Liothrix, ever cuddle up to and
caress its companions, and employ its foot for holding its food ? These
habits are most characteristic of Liothrix, and of the Babbler family-,
to which it undoubtedly belongs, generally.
Food for Waterfowl. Miss Alderson should take care that her pond
contains plenty- of water-snails, small enough for her birds to swallow. I
have observed many species of Ducks, and find that these molluscs are
a favourite food with them, especially with the diving kinds; two Flam-

ingoes, even, that I kept, used to eat them, judging from their swallowing
movements.
Mimicry by Birds in a Wild State. My experience in India corrobor-
ates Mr. C. Harrison's, in that I have never heard a wild Parrakeet imitate
another bird. In England, however, I have heard a Starling give the
Peewit's call, and I fancy our common Mynahs ( Acridotheres tristis) here are
natural mockers.
Emerald Bird of Paradise. Mr. H. J. Fulljauies, with whose dis-
appointment, after his very plucky purchase, I most heartily sympathise,
may be interested to know that for some years we have had males of both
the Large rnd Small Emerald Birds at the Calcutta Zoo.
F. Finn.
BLUE ROBINS.
Sir,--I fear Miss West's experience in breeding Blue Robins is that
of many others : failure in rearing the young is very frequent. Some
aviculturists have been more fortunate than others, probably where the
birds have been kept in large outdoor aviaries and were able to find there
part of the natural food they require to feed their young upon. Under
other circumstances, non-success in rearing the young is often the result.
Probably few soft-billed birds nest more readily in confinement than
Blue Robins, that is, build nests, la}&apos; eggs and hatch them : but rearing the
young is another thing. A young hen Blue Robin was once reared in my
aviary, and she had young the following year, but they all died at a very
tender age. I saw my birds treat their young exactly as Miss West's did,
and carry them, dead or dying, about the aviary--the fuss and noise they
made in doing so attracted my attention. I mentioned this in the Magazine
in July, 1S95, and sent, a little later, a few notes on breeding these birds.
The greater part of my time from the middle of September until
towards June, is spent in travelling on the Continent, and during that time
my birds are looked after by others, servants chiefly; so I have given up
keeping soft-food birds, for I find, during my absences, they don't get the
care and attention they should have, and most servants object to touching
the " horrid mess " the birds require for food. They (the servants) probably
do their best, but it is a very poor " best " sometimes--it is better therefore
to leave soft-billed birds alone, than keep them and not have them properly
looked after, as would be the case with me.

Sir, --According to most avicultural books, Parrakeet-breeding is not
at all a difficult matter, providing only you have a good-sized aviary fitted
up with logs, nests, etc. I must say my experience does not quite bear this
out, and I am acquainted with other Yorkshire aviarists whose experience
is the same.
I have always had a love for birds, and when quite a little chap in
petticoats, nothing gave me greater pleasure than to get hold of a young
one, which I generally managed to rear.
Up to a few years ago I devoted most of my attention to Britishers,
mostly insectivorous, since which I have gradually drifted to the foreign

species ; but to hark back to the Parrakeets. The great difficulty with most
species is to get a true pair, and then, if newly-imported, to get them
acclimatised. It is generally useless to expect them to breed the first
season, indeed, it is better not to encourage them to do so, and there is less
danger from egg-binding if not allowed to nest until their second season.
Some three or four years ago, I had an ambition to breed Mealy
Rosellas. I procured a couple from our esteemed member Mr. Housden ;
in his opinion they were a true pair, they were young birds and had their
heads splashed with red. I eventually (after twelve months keep) proved
them to be both cocks. Advertising one in the Magazine, I sold it to a
gentleman in Surrey. An advertisement for a hen failed to have the desired
effect, and it was not until the August following, 1898, that I procured one--
a newly-imported bird, in poor condition and very weakly. With a lot
of careful nursing and attention I brought her round, and she has re-
warded me this Spring by going to nest and successfully rearing two fine
young ones. I am in hopes the} 7 will even do better next season.
I also might add that in an adjoining box a pair of Cockatiels have
brought off a nest of five -- this speaks well for the disposition and amia-
bility of both pairs.
The other inhabitants of this portion of the aviar} 7 are Red-rumps,
Blossom-heads, Blue-wings and Madagascar Love-birds. It may be of
interest to note that, in another division of the aviary, I have a brace of
Chinese Quails, a week old at the time of writing. Last year they got as
far as perfectly-formed young in eggs, but failed to hatch.

THE NEvSTING OF THE CRIMSONWING.
Sir, -- I quite hoped to send, next month, to the Magazine, an
account of the successful rearing of the Crimsonwing ; but, alas, I have
been disappointed on the very verge of success. I had three beautiful
youngsters hatched from three eggs ; fed most carefully by their parents,
and feathering well, and nearly a month old; when, lo, there came two
bitter cold nights after the tropical week in July, and they took a chill and
died. I could have wept tears of vexation and disappointment over their
untimely death. So near to success and then to have to wait another year !
Mr. F. W. Oates, one of our members and a great friend of mine, has
to-day seen the bodies, and he will certify in a note what grand birds they
were.
I have no heart to write any more ; but if we live another year, I
hope to succeed.

water, even in the Buffalo-wallows, begins to disappear, the Turtles and
Water-snakes bury themselves in the mud, and lie off till the first Monsoon
rains soften the soil and release them for another season. This particular
individual was under about two inches of soil, so dry and heated by the sun
as to be most disagreeable to walk on even with the protection to one's feet
afforded by a heavy pair of shooting boots. Originally the ground had
been covered by a thick growth of grass, but that had all been burnt off
about a month before by a jungle fire, exposing the cracked soil to the full
rays of the sun, and the small round breatliing-hole to the sharp eyes of
my Burman guide. It was quite lively when dug out, and has never to my
knowledge eaten anything since. It seems equally indifferent whether its
residence is in a bag, a basket, an empty cartridge box, or a pail of water. I
saw the shells of several others lying about, but whether they met then-
end by jungle fires or other causes I could not find out.'
" Mr. Finn also exhibited a head of the Clucking Teal ( Nettium
formosum ) from a specimen shot in India recently, and made remarks upon
it." F. Finn.
(d) If we are to admit reptiles (and they are certainly deserving- of notice) would
it not be well to try and amalgamate our Magazine with th &amp; Zoologist ? in which I see an
avicultural corner has very properly been started at Dr. Butler's suggestion.--F. F.
I am quite sure that our member Mr. R. Phillipps never intended to introduce Reptiles
into the Magazine when he wrote his short paragraph on his friend's Tortoise. I am also
quite sure that there would not be room in the Zoologist for the Avicultural Magazine .--
A. G. B.
The insertion of Mr. Phillipps' and Mr. Finn's communications must not be taken
as an indication of an intention to throw the Magazine open to zoological subjects other
than ornithological--though personally I am strongly in favour of such a course. Such a
change of policy would require the approval of the Council. It would not, I think, be
wise to go beyond the vertebrates.--H. R. F.
