REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 19 c 25
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.938248" page_id="56188388"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
The year 1925 is fast drawing to a close, and in looking back we
have to confess that it has been rather an anxious one for the Society.
First there was the amalgamation with the Foreign Bird Club, which
took place on 1st January, 1925. A few months later that was followed
by change of editor, and then came the death of our president, Mr. Astley.
All these events involved a certain amount of extra work and anxiety.
However, we are glad to report that we have now successfully
surmounted the difficulties, and our future to-day looks far more
hopeful than it has done for some time past.
Our membership increases month by month, and our Magazine
has been in such demand that many of the monthly numbers for the
past year are out of print and therefore unobtainable.
We would like to tender our best thanks to all who have contributed
to the welfare of the Society during the past year. To authors, donors
to the illustration and general funds, and to Mr. A. Ezra, Mr. Delacour,
and Captain Stokes, who presented coloured plates.
We would also like to thank Lord Tavistock for his services as
Editor, and Mr. T. H. Newman for preparing the Index both to the
Magazine and to the special book on " Aviculture ", and to Miss Chawner
for her valuable translations of French articles. During the year the
Society's medal has been awarded to Mr. A. Ezra for breeding Spreo
superbus , and to Mr. Shore-Bailv for breeding Turdus olivciceus and
Penthetriopsis macrura.
(Signed for the Council) E. Maud Knobel,
Honorary Secretary and Treasurer.

The Bulbuls (Pycnonotidce) are distinguished from the Timeliidce,
which they resemble, by their short feet, the length of the tarsus never
exceeding that of the middle toe together with its claw. Besides
this they invariably have some long hairs proceeding from the nape ;
these may sometimes be short or inconspicuous, but they are never
absent altogether.
Bulbuls have sweet voices ; they usually frequent gardens and are
very common in their native countries. The males and females
are often alike ; they feed chiefly on fruit, but also eat insects ; they
are not migratory and build cup-shaped nests in which they lay
spotted eggs.
Several kinds of Bulbuls are frequently imported ; they live well
either in a cage or an aviary, according to the species. Different
species require different feeding, so we will divide them into two groups
and indicate how to feed and care for each of them.
Bulbuls occur in South and Eastern Asia, throughout Africa,
in the Malay Archipelago, the Philippines, and the Moluccas.
Green Bulbuls
Green Bulbuls, sometimes called Fruit-suckers ( Chloropsis),
inhabit the South of Asia, the Malay Archipelago, and the
Philippines. Their short tarsi ally them to the Bulbuls. Their
colour is usually brilliant bright green, beak about the length of the
head, slender and slightly curved. They have no crest, have rounded

wings, and short square tail. They live in trees, feeding chiefly
on the insects which, they find among the foliage ; they also partake
of nectar from flowers and soft fruits. Their voices are strong and
pleasing. As a rule they are about the size of a small Thrush.
These birds are often imported, particularly some Indian species,
and thrive well in a cage ; they are long-lived, very beautiful, tame,
and warble pleasantly. They do equally well in a flight aviary if
certain precautions are observed ; some have even spent the winter
out of doors, but it is safer, nevertheless, to give them heat during
bad weather.
The best food is bread and milk sweetened either with sugar or
honey, insectivorous mixture, and sweet fruit, with a few mealworms.
They will also do well on some of the Sugar Birds' sop, or hard-boiled
egg, crushed biscuit, and ants' eggs mixed. In any case they should
have some mealworms and as many live insects as possible.
The Gold-fronted Green Bulbul ( C . aurifrons) is the most commonly
imported of this genus. It is bright green with pale blue wing-
coverts. The forehead and crown of the head, orange yellow ; throat
and cheeks dark blue surrounded with black, which extends to the
lores, the sides of the neck, and base of the throat; a wide line,
beginning at the eye, is itself surrounded by a yellow line. The female
is like the male only slightly less brilliantly coloured.
Malabar Green Bulbul (0. mcdabaricus). This bird also is
occasionally imported. It only differs from the preceding by its
black throat (the cheeks only are blue) and by the absence of the
yellow collar. The female is like the male. This species inhabits
the western part of India and Ceylon.
Yellow-headed Green Bulbul (C. icterocephalus) from Malacca
and Sumatra differs from the above in having the forehead and a band
round the throat yellow, a blue tail, and the wings marked with blue.
It has only been imported once, and is a native of Malacca and
Sumatra.
The Blue-whiskered Green Bulbul (C. cyanopogon ) is smaller than
the preceding species and its green head has merely a shade of yellow
on the forehead. The female is not black-throated. It is a native
of the Malays, Sumatra, and Borneo.

Jardon's Green Bulbul ( C . jerdoni) inhabits India and Ceylon.
It is entirely green, with black lores, chin, and throat, and a blue
moustache. One specimen was imported in 1908 by the late M. E.
Boullet. It lived five years in a cage, and was fed on honey and
water, fruit, and hard-boiled eggs crushed with potato.
Hardwick's Green Bulbul (C. Jiardwickei ), which is found in the
Himalayas and the Malayan Peninsula, is the most beautiful of the
genus. Larger than any of its relations, the male has upper part of
the body green, tinted on the head with tawny yellow. The lower
part of the head, throat, and the upper chest are black, with a large
cobalt-blue moustache. The body underneath is bright orange-brown,
tail blue, washed with purple ; wings green, with the small coverts
pale blue, the primaries black edged with purplish blue. The female
is green with a pale blue moustache, the belly orange brown, and the
coverts pale blue.
This splendid bird is imported from time to time and does well
in captivity.
I shall place the magnificent Blue Drongos on Fairy Blue Birds
next to the Green Bulbuls.
One species, Irena muella , has twice been imported. The London
Zoological Gardens still have a female which has lived there five years.
I obtained a pair, unfortunately in very bad condition, which did
not live. The Blue Drongo owes its common name to a certain
affinity with the true Drongos, among which it was formerly placed.
It is found in Ceylon and Southern India, in Malaya, and Indo-China.
It is as large as a Blackbird, the beak strong and hooked. The male is
brilliant glossy blue with lilac shadings. The long upper tail-coverts
are of the same blue. The rectrices are black ; the under parts of
the body, sides of the head, flights, and the wing-coverts are intensely
black. The beak and legs are black, the eyes red. The female is
dull blue with brighter tips to the feathers.
The Blue Drongo lives in small flocks or in single pairs ; they
frequent the large forest trees and feed chiefly on fruits.
Psaroglossa spiloptera, long considered to be a Starling, may be
placed here ; it has been imported several times. It is a grey bird
with black markings, brown above with a reddish chestnut throat

and pale rust-coloured under parts. The female is brown above,
pale brown below. It is found in the Himalayas, Northern India,
and Burmah.
The True Bulbuls
These birds have rather small, straight beaks, and the head usually
ornamented with long plumes which they can raise into a crest. The
sexes are alike and their prevailing colours are grey and brown, relieved
with white, black, or yellow, rarely red.
Bulbuls are plentiful and tame in most countries where they
are found--Asia, Africa, the Malay Archipelago, Philippines, and
Moluccas. They are frequently met with in gardens.
In captivity they may be given the same food as Thrushes--
insectivorous mixture, boiled rice, and fruit. They are generally
robust and some species are hardy enough to pass our usual winters
out of doors. They sing a short but lively song, and some species
imitate the song of other birds and become really remarkable songsters ;
these do better in cages, but as a rule they are aviary birds. They
breed readily if they have space and cover to their liking. Several
species have reared young, but more often these vanish, and this is
due to an insufficient supply of live insects, which should be provided
in quantity when the birds have hatched.
The Black Bulbuls ( Hypsifetes ) are distinguished by their stout
bodies and forked tails. The head is garnished with slender plumes.
They are to be found in India, Indo-China, China, Japan, and the
Philippines. Three species have been imported :--
H. psaroides, from the Himalayas, is deep grey with the crown of
the head, the base of the beak, and moustache black, the belly whitish,
beak and legs bright red. It is sociable, familiar, and noisy. It
sucks nectar from the large flowers of rhododendrons.
H. ganeesa , from Southern India and Ceylon, resembles the
preceding, but the grey is much darker, almost black.
H. amaurotis , from Japan and East China, has a black beak and
legs ; it is grey striated with black, much darker on the back, wings,
and tail, with a chestnut band beginning at the eye and descending
to the shoulders ; belly, tawny brown.
The Green-winged Bulbul (Hemixus fiavala ) has a square tail

ashy grey above, with the wings and tail edged with yellowish green.
The head is ornamented wdth slender plumes which can be erected
into a crest; it is dark grey, lores and cheeks black, ears brownish grey,
chin, throat, and the centre of the abdomen are white, the remainder
of the under parts pale grey.
This pretty bird inhabits the Himalayas and the mountains to the
east of India. It lives in forests in large trees and also on their out-
skirts. It feeds on fruit. It is brought over occasionally and is
easily kept in a cage. A closely allied species ( lole macclellandi)
has also been imported from these parts. It is olive green above,
the crown of the head chestnut brown ; grey and white beneath, the
ears chestnut, as are also the inferior portions of the body.
The Black-headed Bulbul ( Microtarsus melanocephalus) is a large
bird, brown, tinted with olive green ; the head is straw-coloured,
the lores and cheeks black. The feathers on top of the head are rough
and close. It lives in the Malayan forests.
The Serin Bulbul ( Bleda serina) is found in the forests of West
Africa. Its colour is olive yellow, with a white face, and is brighter
yellow on the under parts. The beak is reddish brown.
The Madagascar Bulbul (Ixocincla Madagascariensis) is greyish
brown, lighter underneath, the top of the head furnished with long
slender black feathers ; beak and legs, yellow. It is common wherever
there are trees; it lives on fruit, seeds, and insects.
The Red-vented Bulbuls are very common in their native lands,
India and the Far East, frequenting gardens in pairs and uttering
their gay notes. They live in trees and eat fruit chiefly. They may
be known by their thick crest, covering the whole crown of the head,
the brightly coloured vent, and tail tipped with white. They are
frequently imported and do well in captivity.
Several kinds of Red-vented Bulbuls ( Molpastes) have been
imported. The common Indian species (M. pygceus, M. hoemorrhous)
arrive most frequently, but sometimes a Chinese species (M.
chrysorrhoides) . They are all very much alike; greyish brown
birds about the size of a Lark, every feather tipped wdth white ;
black head and throat, the coverts and end of the tail white, the belly
whitish, and the vent red. They breed readily in confinement. I have
an Albino specimen all white with a red vent.

The Crested Bulbuls ( Otocompsa ) differ from the above in having
a very long fine crest on the crown of the head. Their habits are
similar. ^
The White-eared Bulbul ( 0 . leucotis) comes from Persia, the
N.W., and Central India. It is slightly smaller than the preceding.
It has a black head with white ears and cheeks. The body is greyish
brown, lighter beneath ; the tail black, tipped with white ; and the
vent bright yellow. It is frequently imported, lives well in an aviary,
and has been bred.
The White-cheeked Bulbul (0. leucogenys) has the forehead and
crest brown, the feathers edged with pale grey. The sides of the
head are black with two white spots, surrounded by black on the
cheeks and ears ; the rest of the plumage is olive brown above, earth
colour below ; the tail is white-tipped save for the two middle feathers,
vent sulphur yellow.
This species inhabits the Western Himalayas and Afghanistan.
It has been imported occasionally.
The Red-whiskered Crested Bulbul (0. emeria), a native of India,
Indo-China, and China, is the most frequently imported of this family.
It is very pretty, black-headed, with a white spot on the cheeks and
a red one under the eyes extending to the ears ; upper parts brown,
the lower white ; a white-tipped tail, with red vent. It is a first-rate
aviary bird and has bred in confinement.
The Black-crested Yellow Bulbul Jfl. jlaviventris) has been imported ;
it is very handsome, entirely yellow shading into olive on the back,
with the head and throat black. It is a native of Indo-China and the
Malayan Peninsula.
The Bulbuls of the genus Pycnonotus, the type of the family, only
differ from the preceding in being without crests. They are found in
forests and do not frequent gardens. Most of them are dull coloured,
but some are very pretty. They all do well in confinement, and some
species are much sought after for their song. Many of these species
are found in Africa, Asia, the Sunda Islands, and the Philippines ;
some of them have occasionally been imported. We need only mention
the following very dull-plumaged species :--P. capensis , from the Cape ;
P. layardi, P. nigricans , from S.E. Africa ; P. arsinoe , from Abyssinia;

P. barbatus, from North Africa ; P. xanthopygus, from Syria and
Palestine ; they are all either brown or grey, and more or less black-
headed ; the vents either yellow or white. Their only interest lies
in their song. Some, especially the Syrian Bulbul, imitate other
birds and sing very well.
The Yellow-bellied Bulbul (P. aurigaster) from Java is brown
above, pale grey beneath, with a black head, cheeks and throat white,
and the vent yellow.
The Bimacula ted Bulbul (P. bimaculatus) , from Java and
Sumatra., is one of the prettiest of the genus. It is olive brown
above, the wings barred with yellow, the head dark brown with yellow-
tinted cheeks and two bright yellow spots between the beak and eye
and above the latter ; grey breast, spotted with dark brown ; light
grey underneath, with a yellow vent. These two species were brought
over in 1920 by M. Frost, and have figured in Mme. Lecallier's
collection.
The Chinese Bulbul (P. sinensis) also is a handsome bird. It is
grey with olive green marking above, wings and tail olive green, tawny
underneath ; the nape brown, likewise the cheeks and ear-coverts,
which become white at the back of the black head with a large white
crescent on the nape and sides ; chin and throat white. It has been
imported several times.
The Bed-throated Bulbul ( Rubigula gularis) is a splendid bird
from the south-east of India ; it is yellowish green above, brilliant
yellow underneath, head black, and throat ruby red. It has very
rarely been imported.
The Finch-billed Bulbul ( Spizixus canifrons) differs from all other
Bulbuls in having a short, thick, curved beak ; it is square-tailed,
it has a long, pointed, thick crest, and very short weak feet. It is
green with a grey forehead ; the crest, a ring round the eyes, the
throat, and the end of the tail, black ; cheeks grey speckled with dark
brown, ear coverts brown, beak and feet yellow. A few specimens
have been imported. I have had some which arrived in bad condition
and did not live long.

The birds of the family of the Campophagidce resemble the Shrikes
in their appearance. They differ in that the feathers on the lower
part of the back have rigid shafts, and their beak is less powerful
and less hooked and wider at the base. They are also allied to the
Flycatchers: the small species especially resemble these. They
are like them in their habits, being purely insectivorous. They are
found in Asia, Africa, and Oceania. They mostly have grey plumage
with black and white markings, and are rather large, varying in size
from a Jay to a Lark. They are usually migratory. They build
cup-shaped nests, their eggs are speckled, and the young have streaked
plumage. As far as I know, only two genera have been kept in captivity
in Europe. They lived on the same food as the small Soft-bills, such
as Flycatchers.
The Tri-coloured Cuckoo-shrike or Caterpillar-eater (Lalage tricolor),
from Australia, has been on view in the Zoological Gardens in London
and Berlin. It is of medium size ; when the male is in breeding
plumage he has the top of his head, the back of the neck, and the
top of the back black ; the lower part of the back is light grey.
The wings are black and white, the tail black tipped with white on
the outer rectrices ; the cheeks, throat, and the upper parts of the body
are white ; the female, and the male when he is out of colour, are
light brown above, pale tawny lightly streaked with black below ;
the eyebrows cream coloured ; the wing-feathers and tail black,
bordered tawny rust colour. This bird is a good songster.
The Minivets ( Pericrocotus ) are allied to the Flycatchers. They
are magnificent birds, inhabiting India, Malavia, Indo-China, China,
Japan, and the Philippines. Generally speaking the sexes are not
alike, the males being black and red or yellow, while the females are
grey and yellow. Minivets live in little flocks among the trees, hunting
insects in the leaves.
Four species of these fine birds have been imported up to now.
They require the same treatment as Flycatchers, that is to say, a diet
suitable for small Soft-bills.

The Scarlet Minivet (P. speciosus) has the breast, the rump, the
lower back, all the under parts of the body, part of the wings and
the tail bright red; the remainder of the plumage is black.
The female is dark grey above, yellow beneath. This superb bird
is about 23 cm. in length, and is a native of the East Himalayas.
The Short-billed Minivet (P. hrevirostris) is smaller, but much
like the above ; its beak is shorter and tail longer. The female
has an orange-yellow tail and wing markings. It also is found in the
Himalayas.
The Small Minivet (P. peregrinus), which is found from India to
Indo-China and Java, is grey above with the rump red ; wings and
tail, black and red ; throat and sides of the head, black ; under parts,
orange yellow, scarlet on the breast; female, pale grey, yellowish
white underneath ; size, small.
The Rosy Minivet (P. roseus), from the Himalayas, is greyish brown
above ; wings and tail, black and red ; under parts rosy pink, whitish
on the throat; in the female the rosy pink of the male is replaced
by pale yellow.

The numerous family of Flycatchers is made up of small birds,
mostly migratory, which may be known by their short, often flat
beaks, the presence of numerous hairs springing from the forehead
towards the nostrils, and their extremely weak feet. They feed on
insects, sometimes also on berries. They prefer to perch on dead
boughs or on stakes, etc., whence they take wing to catch insects
in the air, returning each time to the same perch.
Flycatchers are extremely graceful, and many of them have fine
plumage in which blue predominates. They live well in confinement
on small Soft-bill mixture, that is to say, an insectivorous food and
living insects, ants' eggs, mealworms, etc. They are best kept in
cages.
Flycatchers are found all over the world. A few species inhabit

Europe and America, but they are particularly numerous in Asia,
Africa, and Oceania.
Four European and a dozen or so of foreign species have been
kept in captivity in Europe.
The Grey Flycatcher (Muscicapa grisola) is the grey bird which
every one knows in gardens. It arrives in May and leaves us the end
of summer. It often builds its nest in espaliers and sometimes chooses
the most extraordinary places.
The Black Flycatcher (M. atricapilla) lives chiefly in the South
of Europe, and is rarer than the preceding. In summer the male is
black above, with the wings and tail marked with white ; forehead,
cheeks, and all the under parts are white in winter, the black and
white both greyish. The female is grey, paler underneath, with white
in the wings.
The Pied Flycatcher (M. collaris) differs from the above in having
the white frontal spot much larger, and a large white collar behind
the neck. It inhabits Central Europe.
The Buddy-throated Flycatcher (Siphia parva) inhabits South-
east Europe, Central Asia, and India. It is like a Bobin : brown
above, yellowish white below, throat and upper portion of the chest
orange red, two blue grey marks on the sides of the head. The female
lacks the blue grey on the head and her breast is yellowish red.
Tickell's Blue Flycatcher ( Cyornis tickellice) is blue, slightly slate
coloured, with black lores and ear-coverts grey blue ; throat and
breast are bright rust red ; the belly is white ; the beak rather long
and narrow. The female only differs in having rather duller colouring.
This Flycatcher is a native of India, Ceylon, the Malayan Peninsula,
and Indo-China. It nests in holes in banks and trees. It is a true
Flycatcher, feeding on insects which it catches on the wing or on
branches. They have been imported occasionally. I have owned
several. They have a pleasant song, but they are decidedly delicate.
The Yerditer Flycatcher ( Stoparola melanops) is more often imported
although still rarely enough. I have owned it several times. It is
found in India, in Malaya, in Indo-China, and China. Its beak is
short and rather wide, its colour light sea-blue turning to verdigris,
brightest on the head ; the lores and round the beak black. The female

is rather duller and is speckled with white on the throat. It is a
delightful bird, and once acclimatized lives well in a cage.
The Niltavas ( Niltava ) are remarkable for their glorious plumage,
in which bright blue predominates. They frequent thick forest and
live on berries as well as insects. They have narrow beaks, the base
covered with thick hair. The females are unlike the males, but in
both sexes Niltavas may be known by bright blue spots on the side
of the neck.
Niltavas live well in confinement; they should be given the same
food as Flycatchers and sweet fruit, especially grapes. Three species
have been imported, one, N. sundara, fairly often ; they are among
the most beautiful and graceful birds one could possibly have.
The Greater Niltava (N. grandis) attains a length of 20 cm. in Indo-
China; it inhabits East Himalaya. The male has the top of the head, the
rump, the wing-coverts, and a large spot on either side of the neck
very bright cobalt blue ; the back is violet blue, the flights and the
rectrices are black and deep blue. The remainder of the body is dull
blue. The female is olive brown above, tawny below, with a blue
mark on each side of the neck.
The Rufous-bellied Niltava (N. sundara) is smaller (15 cm.). The
male has the forehead, lores, the sides of the head, and the throat
black ; the crown of the head, the nape, the rump, the coverts of the
wings and tail brilliant blue, the rest of the upper part of the body
deep blue, all underneath is bright red. The female is olive brown,
with a white mark on the front of the neck and two blue marks on
the sides.
This beautiful bird inhabits Eastern Himalaya, Indo-China, and
China.
The Lesser Niltava (N. macgregorice) has recently been imported.
It is to be found in the Eastern Himalayas. It only measures 12 cm.
The male is entirely blue, most brilliant in the same parts as the
preceding. It is black in front of the eyes and round the beak ; the
cheeks, ears, throat, and breast purple ; the under parts ashy grey.
The female is olive brown above, yellowish below, with two blue
patches on the sides of the neck.

is smaller than the preceding. It is dull blue above and white below,
with white eyebrows and a wide blue collar interrupted in front.
The female is olive brown washed with blue. It spends the summer
in the Himalayas and the winter in India.
The Japanese Blue Flycatcher (Cyanoptila bella) is a fasci-
nating blue bird with the sides of the head, the throat, and breast
black, and a white belly. It is to be found in China also, and migrates
to Indo-China and Malaya for the winter.
The White-starred Bush Robin ( Pogonocichla stellata) is the only
member of its family which has so far come to us from Africa. It is
a small bird, recalling the Redstart in appearance. The sexes are
alike. The head and neck are blue grey with a little white spot in
front of and above each eye, the back olive green, wings grey blue,
the under parts orange-yellow, also the tail, which, however, is edged
and tipped with black and the two middle feathers black. It has the
curious power of hiding and showing the white spots on its forehead
at will, though they are usually visible.
This charming bird inhabits South Africa ; it is a forest dweller,
frequenting thick bushes, and is very shy. It is altogether
insectivorous. To judge by the one I possess, which is the only
specimen yet imported and which has been over three years in Europe,
first with the Hon. Mrs. Bourke, then with me, it lives well and thrives
on the mixture which suits the small Soft-bills.
The Rhipidura or Fantail Flycatchers are very abundant in
Oceania ; several are also natives of India and the Far East. They
may be recognized by their thick beaks, amply furnished with hair
at the base, and their large rounded fan-shaped tails.
The Three-coloured Rhipidura or Black and White Fantail ( Rhipi-
dura tricolor ) has been imported from Australia ; its body is black
with dark brown tail and wings, the eyebrows, very slight moustache,
and the belly are white.
The Red-headed Robin ( Miro australis ), from New Zealand, has
occasionally figured in European collections. It is black above, marked
on wings and tail with white, the throat is black, the breast orange,
and the belly yellow.

Shrike-like bird, very common and tame in Australia. It is grey,
with yellow under parts, olive back and rump, and a white throat.
The Scarlet-breasted Robin (Petroica multicolor) is another
Australian bird, black and white, wuth pinkish red breast. A close
relation (P. phoenicia ), with an orange-red breast, has also been
imported.

In writing articles on our insectivorous species (of which, during the
last forty years, I have kept successfully every species that I consider
capable of being kept in perfect health and tame, and which have all
been of intense interest to me), I trust my remarks will be helpful
to those aviculturists who also keep insectivorous birds.
To keep these birds in perfect condition and song has always been
my aim, and it has been through observing the birds in their wild
state for hours at a time that I have learnt many things that have
been a tremendous help to me in keeping them in the condition they
should be kept in.
One can learn a good deal from outdoor observation, but one can
learn a great deal more when he keeps them as pets, which he
could never learn from them in the wild state ; and in writing, I shall
endeavour to show how I feed, exactly what staple food I use, the
various live foods as the seasons come round, the size of cage for each
species, the way to moult them, and also the few ailments which all
birds--not only in cages or aviaries, but in the wild state--are
occasionally subject to, and the way in which these ailments can
be absolutely cured.
Now I do not wish for one moment that these articles shall appear
as an advertisement for my foods, but if I am to write and show how
my own birds have been fed to attain the best results, I shall fearlessly
mention exactly how they are fed and on what foods.

P. F. M. Galloway --
The Nightingale (Danilas luscinia)
The Nightingale is not at all a difficult bird to keep in confinement.
Either the hand-reared or adult will thrive and sing well; the adult
male will often commence singing when caged only a short time,
sometimes within a fortnight; the young commence to practise their
song before they are full-growm, but do not sing a good, full, loud song
until the second year.
These birds vary considerably in the quality and length of the
passages in their song : some will sing indifferently in cage or aviary ;
others will sing grandly, but there are good, bad, and indifferent
songsters in the wild state just the same. Some Nightingales make the
underwoods echo with long and beautiful notes with hardly a pause
between the passages ; others sing poorly and in snatches, and it is not
a case of one being a last season's bird and the other, the best songster,
being adult.
The Nightingale arrives about the middle of April and commences
to sing as soon as it has arrived at its favourite spot, which may be
an overgrown double hedgerow with a ditch in the middle, with brambles
and rank herbage growing thickly, or they will select the corner of some
underwood where the hazel nut bushes flourish, especially where
ivy and bunches of nettle abound, or on the edge of a common where
thorns, brambles, and the furze grow well, but wherever they have
selected they seldom move far from it and then only for a short time,
to fight and drive away another cock-bird that has come too near
its selected spot. There may be three or four Nightingales in one
underwood, but they keep a respectful distance from each other, but
if they encroach on the other's preserves there is a row at once and
a great chasing in and out of the bushes, singing one against the other
as if in defiance all the time until the intruder has gone back to his
own spot. This goes on at intervals until the hens arrive and the
birds have mated up.
It must not be imagined that all the males find mates and breed ;
they do not, and those males that have not found mates are bachelor
birds that can be heard singing after the others have practically
finished for the season.
The fact is that, in the nests, cocks predominate. I have examined
</bodyText>

many nests of young, and have invariably found more cocks than
hens, but with species who have two and even three nests of young
in the season, the last nests generally contain more hens than cocks.
Referring again to the song of this bird, in the wild state it only
sings from about the middle of April until the first week in June,
when the young hatch, but in captivity we can beat nature hollow,
for it will often sing for many riionths, even in some cases throughout
the year, except during the time occupied by the moult. " Birds in
a cage or aviary do not sing because they are unhappy S " If this were
so, then how very unhappy they must all be in the wild state, for the
song is exactly the same when the bird is kept as a pet as it is in the
wild state--not one atom of difference. I have known Nightingales
live in perfect health for years in cages and sing well: even up to nine
years of age. Goldfinches have lived and thrived over twelve years,
infinitely longer than they would ever get a chance of doing in the
wild state, for they have too many enemies, and their worst enemy
is the weather. It is the latter that has been the chief cause of the
scarcity of our common Swallow (Hirundo rustica).
The Nightingale builds towards the end of the third week in May.
The nest is built of dead oak and other leaves, also the loose dead
rind of the wild honeysuckle and dead stalks of the dog&apos;s mercury ;
a lot of leaves are used, and the nest is placed generally on the ground,
but sometimes on a stump of a hazel-nut bush, or in a small bunch
of nettles. Others I have found three feet from the ground in black-
berry brambles, also on a few occasions built up in a hedge beside
a wood ; it is lined with a few fine roots and a little horsehair, the
nest being rather deep. The nest is built with the dead leaves when
they are wet, so that when it is completed the whole is firm and
practically cemented together.
Many birds build rapidly during and after a shower of rain, even
the Thrush builds with wet material, and the lining of wet mud and
cow-dung, as soon as dry, is quite firm and looks not unlike the inside
of a coconut shell.
The eggs of the Nightingale are different in colour to other small
birds, being dark olive green all over, with occasionally a fairly
pronounced zone at the larger end of deeper olive brown.

The young are hatched generally during the first week or early
part of June, some extra early nests I have found with newly hatched
young by the end of May.
When I speak of birds thriving in captivity, I am alluding to those
kept by people who take a keen interest in their birds and see that
their wants are supplied in regard to food, water, etc., and understand
the matter ; and this brings me to the subject of cages.
The cage for a Nightingale should be 2 ft. by 1 ft. 3 in. and 10 in.
deep, with a perch at each end, placed from back to front, and one
along level with the front rail, so that the bird can fly down to the
food and water vessel. The perches arranged at each end of the cage
allows the bird to fly from one to the other. Some people put far too
many perches in a cage, and the bird simply hops from one to the
other.
It is not hopping exercise that a bird wants only, but flying exercise.
It is like a man having his legs tied but being allowed to move his
arms, and therefore not able to take walking exercise. It is far
healthier for a bird to be compelled to fly from one perch to the other,
than to hop only. Padded perches are quite unnecessary, clean
perches absolutely necessary, or birds' feet become sore or swollen.
This I shall deal with under the heading of " Ailments of Birds "
later, on.
(To be continued.)

I have my aviaries arranged in one long rectangle, and this I have
divided into compartments (each compartment 9 feet long by
3 feet wide). The front faces south-east, and is all wire (wire netting,
J in. mesh). At the top I have 18 inches of wire in the front, as I find
the Parrakeets love to hang on the wire, and let the rain drop on to
them ; after they have done this they usually go to their baths and
bathe thoroughly. Then for the other part of the roof I have wood and
felt, so as to keep the birds dry, and not only keep them dry but give a
good shelter from the sun and winds. I find birds require shade as well

as sunshine, and by this method I think I have both. I keep chiefly
Parrakeets and so cannot have any shrubs in their aviaries, only two
perches across, and a few pieces of apple wood hanging on the wire,
for them to bite up and amuse themselves with. I always do my best
to let them have as much exercise as possible, for that, I think, is the
most essential thing to keep them in good health. When the breeding
season is over I have a succession of doors (which lead from one aviary to
another, all the way along) and these I open and keep so that all through
the winter they get a good flight from one end to the other. Of course,
I only keep birds together which agree, and Broadtails, I find, will live
peacefully together when not wishing to breed. Conures I always have
to keep alone, as I find they are most quarrelsome with other Parrakeets.
I must say I have been very careful in the building of the aviaries,
as I hope the photographs show. I have the whole rectangle on a
foundation of bricks about 18 inches in the ground, and this (so far) I
have found quite enough to keep out rats. Mice I cannot keep out,
as they creep through the wire when they are very young and never
leave ; but, with no cover for mice to hide in, I am not worried
much ; but in aviaries where there is cover--and they are not used
for Parrakeets, but for Finches, Quails, etc.--I find mice a fearful
nuisance, and am always waging war against them.
This year I have not had much success breeding, as the cold east
winds in the spring rendered the Parrakeet eggs unfertile, and when a
few eggs happened to hatch the cold, damp weather killed the young
birds. I have lost two nests of the Yellow-fronted Conures (which was
a great disappointment), both from the weather, I fear. In the last nest
I had two young ones, and they were nearly feathered before they died.
Now, in October, I have a nest of Gouldian Finches (three young
ones) nearly feathered, a nest of Green Singing Finches (three young
ones), but as their nest is in a very exposed place I fear the rain
will wash the young out of the nest. The Chinese Painted Quails
have laid again (they do every autumn). These, I fear, will do no
good, owing to the lateness of the year. I have been trying to get a pair
of Barbary Doves to nest, and then I should put the Quail's eggs under
them and try to rear in a foster-mother. This, I think, could be
managed. I tried the eggs in an incubator last year, but had no success.

My Quails nested in the spring of this year, but, alas ! the eggs were
eaten by mice.
My Shamahs had three nests this year, but the hen ate the young
ones as soon as ever they hatched. This, I think, was due to too
stimulating food. The second nest of eggs I placed under a Spotted
Fly-catcher, and she brought the young ones up to a good size and then
I tried to hand rear, but, alas ! I fear I gave them too much food--
although I fed chiefly on live insects--and they all died.
I have reared three Ringnecked Parrakeets, all strong, healthy birds,
and just over the moult.
I will conclude by only hoping that other aviculturists have had
better successes this year than I have had. Last year was a much
more interesting time in the aviaries than this--chiefly, I think, due to
better climatic conditions. I had an interesting cross between a Bauer
and Mealy Rosella. I had four beautiful young birds, two of which I
presented to the London Zoological Society. One of my remaining young
birds died during the first month ; the other I have, and it is a most
intelligent bird, an excellent mimic, and extremely handsome. She
imitates the call of the cock Painted Quail beautifully. In the spring
I am going to try and pair her with an Adelaide Parrakeet cock. Of
course, the result may be nil, but one can never tell the result till
one tries.

The Cinereous Tinamou is a bird that enjoys a very extensive
range. According to the British Museum Catalogue, it is found from
Guiana and Eastern Peru to the Rio Madeira, and Hudson says that
it is also found in Northern Argentina and Uruguay. I think that
my birds probably came from Guiana, as I got at the same time a
specimen of the very rare Crypturus maconelli, whose habitat is British
Guiana.
C. cinereus is about the same size as our Red-legged Partridge ;
in colour it is greyish brown, the feathers on the back and upper parts

being prettily edged with brown. The throat and upper breast is
dirty white. Legs grey and not yellowish as stated in the British
Museum Catalogue. The feathers on crown of head are erectile,
and as the under sides are black the bird looks, wdien excited, to have
a black crest. This is a very distinguishing mark.
G . maconelli is a rather smaller bird, and is uniformly plumbeous
grey all over, a very unusual form of colouring for this type of bird.
Every other Tinamou I have seen has barred plumage on some part
of its body. I turned my two pairs of birds into a large summer
aviary, where they quickly disappeared into the thick cover. Little
was seen or heard of them until towards the end of May, when I heard
one of them calling. A search was successful in locating a nest in
a thick tuft of grass containing eight nearly black eggs, intensely
glossy as are most of the eggs of the Tinamou family. On examining
the nest on 15th June, I found that they were on the point of hatching,
but the following morning when I went to take the young ones to
rear in a foster-mother the nest was empty. A search for the young
proved a lengthy business, as they had scattered all over a rather
large and densely planted aviary, and every little one was apparently
on its own, and independent of its parents. However, in three days
we caught six of them, and concluded that the other two must have
died. These we reared in a foster-mother, and they did very well,
becoming very tame. One we lost, as when the foster-mother was
open it became frightened and flew straight up into the air and
disappeared. In about a month's time both hens went to nest again,
the cocks of course doing the incubating, and one day whilst I was
examining one of the nests I flushed a bird which on examination
proved to be a half-grown Tinamou, one of the birds that had escaped
us earlier in the year. Later on we found a second youngster, and
both of these, in spite of the very wet summer, grew into fine birds.
Whether the cock parent mothered them at night I am unable to
say, but he certainly did not do so when we found them, as he was
sitting on eggs. I think that, altogether, both Tinamou hens had
three clutches, two of which I removed for my collection. However,
late in the season one of the males brought off a troop of four or five
young from a nest that I had failed to discover. None survived,

although one at least was alive five or six weeks after I first saw them.
In conclusion, I would say that this Tinamou makes quite a nice aviary
bird, although it is hardly so steady as the larger Rufous Tinamou.
I can find no record of its having been bred in captivity, and it seems
to have been very rarely imported.

1 think that the experience of the vast majority of us who have used
oil in any way to heat our aviaries is that, sooner or later, we come one
morning and find a dense fog and our birds dead. Happily for my birds
and myself, my experiments took place in a small greenhouse with only
plants to suffer. After scrubbing the place out and repainting the inside
I wrote to the gas company to see if they could help me. They put in
a small-sized " Daisy " boiler, fitted up the hot-water pipes, ran the
gas-pipe 30 feet and through the garden wall, picked up and relaid the
path outside, connected up with the main, all for #16 18s. 8 d. I find that
the gas costs me no more than the oil did, at the price that it was then,
two years ago.
The boiler and gas chamber are contained in an oblong iron case,
which projects into the greenhouse at the side and only opens in the
front outside, avoiding any possibility of gas fumes entering the house.
Beyond brushing out the gas chamber about once a week to keep the
jets clean, and looking to see if it is burning properly once a day, there is
no trouble whatever. If at any time I was forced to use oil again
I should use hot-water pipes connected with a boiler and lamp in a
separate compartment, and if it smoked no harm would be done to
the birds.

We have received from an Indian member, Mr. Satya Charan Law,
a copy of the first volume of his book, Pet Birds of Bengal. This volume
deals chiefly with insectivorous birds, some of which are well known in
England, while others are rarely imported. Mr. Law's book is as
interesting from an avicultural point of view as it is accurate from a
scientific one, and we look forward with pleasure to the appearance of
Vol. II._

THE AIM OF KINGFISHERS AND OTHER REMARKS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997641333333333" page_id="56188428"  page_num="26" year="" vol="">
Sir, --In the Avicultural Magazine for 1923 there is, on page
277, an article headed " Fearlessness of Kingfishers ", by Katherine
Currey, in which that writer, referring to birds in Surrey, quotes the
words of another observer--" never misses prey."
Whether such a dogmatic statement would hold true if applied
to the species in various parts of Britain and Ireland seems to me
exceedingly doubtful--even if full-grown birds only are included--
they being presumably more experienced and skilful fishers than part-
grown ones.
Certainly such a statement would not hold true if applied to the
larger bird known as the Brown-headed Stork-billed Kingfisher of India,
Pelargopsis gurial, judging by the doings of a healthy adult which
lived several years ago, about 1902 or 1903, in the Western Aviary
of the London Gardens, and which was often watched by me, there
being an account of it in a notebook of mine. This bird was

a large one, being about 14 inches in total length with stretch of wing
about 6 inches, and used to sit on a perch before feeding and make
successive rapid rushes through the air towards the pond in which
fish were put for it, always returning to the same perch to crack a fish
on the head after catching one in its large beak.
Possibly the large species of the group which live almost exclusively
on fish (called Alcedinince by the late R. Bowdler Sharpe) offer
more resistance to the air, during their rapid flight towards the fish
they are trying at the moment to catch, than do the small species
such as the British one Alcedo ispida, only about seven inches long ;
and so a large bird cannot aim so accurately with its beak as a small
bird can. But be that view as it may, the fact remains that the above
large Indian bird often missed its aim at a fish (especially when the
first few were caught and eaten, and the remaining fish swam hurriedly
about to try and escape).
An acquaintance I met in the Gardens about five years ago, also
told me he had often seen wild birds of this species miss prey in India,
thus confirming my observations. The above was, without exception,
the prettiest Kingfisher yet seen alive by me, whether of this group
or of the mostly insect and reptile-eating group, the Dacelonince, and the
colour of it recorded as ## large red beak, head chocolate brown, breast
and abdomen yellow with yellow collar round neck, red feet, back
wings, tail, are blue." In Museum specimens the latter are given
as greenish-blue (R. Nat. Hist., vol. iv, p. 71) ; but comparison of the
live bird with Museum skins shows these fade to some extent after
death, which has been referred to by me before in the Avicultural
Magazine for 1923.
I may add that the acquaintance mentioned also told me he had seen
this species eat a nestling of another kind of bird, after uttering loud
cries, much like the scene recorded in R. Nat. Hist, above mentioned
as seen by Mr. Stuart Baker. Frederick D. Welch.

Obituary
First breeder in the United Kingdom, Teschemaker, 1908. Avic.
Soc. Medal. Two young were reared, and a second nest followed
from which two more were reared. (See A.M ., 1908, 257, and B.N.,
vii, 120; viii, 190.) The specific name used in the accounts was
' griseola ", a synonym. The species has also been bred elsewhere,
i.e. by Poltimore, who reared six. (See B.N., 1914, 50.)
I know of no previous record of the breeding of the Olivaceous
Thrush or of the Yellow-backed Whydah recorded by Shore-Baily
on pp. 255 and 256. The breeding of the Lesser Sulphur-crested
Cockatoo will also, I think, be a " first " if the young are fully reared.
Perhaps the breeder will let us know where the breeding took place
and the date. The cross Roseate Cockatoo and Lesser Sulphur-
crested Cockatoo is one recorded: Mrs. Lee, 1917. (See B.N.,
1917, 204, 232.)

OBITUARY
MRS. DALTON-BURGESS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998441647058823" page_id="56188430"  page_num="28" year="" vol="">
It is with very deep regret that we announce the death of
Mrs. Dalton-Burgess, of Clifton, which took place in December. Though
.a comparatively new recruit to Aviculture, Mrs. Dalton-Burgess was
extremely keen, and possessed a really wonderful collection, accounts
\0x25A0of her birds having frequently appeared in the Magazine. The
accommodation available at St. John's Road hardly did justice to many
Tare and beautiful species and to the personal care of their owner in
attending to their wants, and, sad to say, at the time of her death,
Mrs. Dalton-Burgess was in the middle of constructing a fine range of
aviaries at her country house which should have ensured many
interesting breeding successes.
Mrs. Dalton-Burgess was a frequent contributor of articles to the
Magazine and had made a generous promise of coloured plates. The
Editor and her other friends in the Society will never forget her kindness
in giving, or lending, rare and valuable birds. She was particularly
successful in breeding blue Budgerigars of various shades and her stock
was always of fine size and colour.

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed
account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from the date
of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the Executive
Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the
young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent
of their parents.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine before it
is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of the young,
and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the species.
These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal
is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have been
awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures 2 |inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 ". On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to [name of recipient ] for rearing the young of [name of
species ], a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom."

WAGTAILS AND PIPITS

The restricted family of the Motacillidce includes two principal
groups : the Wagtails ( Motacilla ) and the Pipits (Anthus).
Every one knows our Wagtails, whether it be the Dishwasher,
grey, black, and white, or the " Printaniere ", grey and yellow. They
are pretty birds, with a delicate beak, long slim legs, and a long tail
which they constantly wag. They have terrestrial habits and walk
with the greatest ease, frequenting stubble, meadows, and above all, the
edge of water. The Dishwashers, especially, are very aquatic, hopping
from stone to stone, resting on floating plants, and even when on the
wing hunting insects which rise from the surface of the water ; they
are extremely graceful and nothing is prettier than to see them moving
about amongst the rocks of a torrent.
The majority of the species are migrants ; they are then sociable,
and often live in small flocks. Their diet is entirely insectivorous.
The males have a special livery in summer, and in winter they assume
that of the females. One meets with Wagtails everywhere, and some
among them have a very wide area of distribution.
The Wagtails nest on the ground, in small cavities, mostly in the
neighbourhood of water ; their eggs, four to five in number, are very
much spotted.
One hardly ever sees any but European species in captivity ;
exotic species, excepting two, have never been imported ; it must

be said that they very much resemble our own and offer no particular
interest. Moreover, in spite of their undoubted grace/ Wagtails
and Pipits are not really adapted for a life of captivity.
The White Wagtail, or Dishwasher ( Motacilia alba), is a beautiful
bird with a grey back, with black and &apos;white wings and tail, white
abdomen, head white in &apos;the middle, &amp;quot;black above and below, black
breast, and is seen everywhere near water. With the hen, and the
cock in winter, the head has no black and the top of the throat is white ;
the plumage of the body is more mixed with grey. An allied species,
the Pied or Yarrel's Wagtail (M. lugubris), is blacker on the top of the
body, and is peculiar to England, where it replaces the preceding
species.
The Blue-headed Wagtail (M. cinerea) has the top of the body
slate-grey and the lower part yellow ; two white lines start from the
beak and pass above the eye and under the cheek ; the cock in summer
has the chin and the throat black ; they are white, edged with black
towards the bottom, in the hen, and the cock in winter; the tail is
white, with the median feathers grey edged with yellow.
This Wagtail is more frequently met with in the southern parts
of Europe. It is generally speaking sedentary, but one sees it in greater
numbers in the North of France in winter.
The Yellow Wagtail (M.flava) has a shorter tail than the preceding
ones, and goes farther from water. The male, in summer, has an olive
green back and a head grey on the top, with a wide white eyebrow ;
it is pale yellow below ; the wings and the tail are shaded with grey
and yellowish white ; the whole of the under part of the body is yellow.
The female and the male in winter are paler, and have a white throat.
We shall only cite the allied species, which differ by a different
distribution of the colours grey, black, yellow, and white: M. rayi,
M. feldeggi, M. campestris , M. borealis.
The Alpine Pipit (Anthus spipolett(R). ) is ashy-brown above, the middle
of the feathers being darker ; lower surface whitish, washed with
vinous colour and spotted with brown on the \0x25A0 sides; eyebrow, tawny
white.
This species is found in summer in the mountains and descends
into the plains or migrates towards the south in winter. An allied

species, the Eock Pipit (A. obscurus), of a more olive colour, is met
especially at the seaside in the north-west.
The Meadow Pipit (A. pratensis) resembles the preceding : it is
smaller and has the under part of the body all spotted with blackish
brown. It frequents fields and meadows.
The Tree Pipit (A. trivialis) is olive grey above, streaked with brown
on the head and back. Below, it is whitish, tinged with brown, with
the breast and sides spotted and streaked with blackish brown. It
is migratory and frequents the " Landes ", bushes and sparse woods.
The Tawny Pipit (A. campestris) is brown above, fawn below,
with a wide eyebrow of isabelline colour, brownish cheeks variegated
with yellow, the lores and a stripe on the sides of the throat black.
It is migratory and frequents sand dunes and open and arid places.
Some exotic species have been imported ; for example :--
The Madras Wagtail ( Motacilla maderaspatensis), black above
from the beak to the tail, which is edged with white ; the wing is black,
marked with white ; head black, with white eyebrow ; breast black ;
the under part of the body is white, washed with bluish grey on the
sides. This species inhabits the whole of India and Ceylon.
Another Wagtail also has been imported from India, the Limoni-
dromus indicus.
Finally, the Cape Pipit (Macronyx capensis) is brown tinged with
orange on the forehead ; tail, brown terminating in white ; orange
eyebrow, as well as the whole of the throat, which is surrounded
with a black line starting from the beak and widening on the breast;
under part of the body orange yellow, spotted with black on the breast;
in winter the plumage is more sombre. This bird inhabits South Africa.
The Pipits stand, so to speak, half-way between the Wagtails and
the Larks. They are also terrestrial and, while they have the delicate
beak and the slim legs of the former, they resemble the latter by their
tawny brown plumage, flecked with dark brown and their habit of
singing while in flight. They also resemble the Larks by their mode
of life and their movements ; they are, however, more insectivorous.
The cock and the hen are similar.
The Pipits are distributed all over the globe. They nest on the
ground, and lay from four to six spotted eggs.

Wagtails and Pipits thrive very well in a cage and in an aviary,
where they only require the ordinary care and diet of small insectivorous
birds ; some insectile food, mixed half and half with bread and
milk and scraped carrot suits them very well. However, on account
of their terrestrial habits, they must be given a specially arranged
cage, long and low, with a clod of turf, sand, and stones to rest on ;
for the Wagtails it will be well to place at their disposal a fairly large
basin, strewn with large pebbles.
In an aviary these birds thrive equally well, and when they have
access to a small brook or to a pond, their evolutions on its banks
are charming. Unfortunately, they are rather quarrelsome and one
can hardly associate them with birds weaker than themselves. In
spring, the cocks have to be separated.

AMERICAN WARBLERS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.96902385" page_id="56188458"  page_num="32" year="" vol="">
By J. Delacour
In America a family of small birds is found which replaces our
European Warblers, and this is the reason its members are called
American Warblers. These are the Mniotiltidce.
These birds have a fine beak and generally resemble our Warblers
in appearance, but on a smaller scale and with brighter colours, which
are more elegantly distributed. Some sing well, but the greater part
have a mediocre voice. On the other hand, nearly all of them are
very pretty birds, many being more richly adorned than our European
Warblers. Their tongue is bifid or furnished with brushes, and in
this they resemble the Ccerebidee. They are, however, essentially
insectivorous. The majority are arboreal in habits, but some like to
walk on the ground, while others climb on tree trunks.
The American Warblers are very numerous and very varied.
The majority have not been imported, and those which have been
have only arrived on rare occasions. Their transport is difficult,
and many species, being protected in the United States, cannot now be
exported ; they also offer slight interest to the majority of amateurs,
who have never had the opportunity of seeing them. Otherwise,
they are charming birds which, in captivity, require the diet of small

delicate insectivorous birds such as the Willow Warblers,
Nightingales, etc.
By reason of their scarcity in captivity, we shall only briefly cite
the few species which have been brought alive to Europe : Helmin-
thopliila pinus, olive yellow, with grey wings and tail; Compsothlypis
americana, ashy grey, with olive coloured back, throat and breast
yellow, and in &apos;the middle a double band of dark brown and orange ;
Mniotilta varia, all lined with white and dark brown ; Dendroica
oestiva, yellow, with back, wings, and tail mingled with grey and
reddish brown lines on the breast; D. palmarum, olive grey with
the upper part of the head maroon; D. coronata, variegated with
dark grey and white, with the top of the head, the sides, and the rump
yellow ; D. virens, with the back and the tail olive green, the top
of the head olive maroon, the wings and flanks dark grey and white,
the belly pale yellow, the sides of the head bright yellow, the throat
and the breast black. All these species are very small in size, very
elegant, and have arboreal habits.
Siurus auricapillus is rather terrestrial; it is olive brown
above, whitish spotted with dark brown below, with the crown
bright red surrounded by a black line.
Icteria virens, larger, is olive brown above, with the eye
surrounded with black and white above and below and all the lower
parts yellowish fawn.
Oporornis formosa resembles it, but has no white on the face.
All these birds inhabit the United States in summer and migrate
in winter to Central America and the West Indies. There are many
other species, some even much prettier. But they will never be the
habitual guests of our cages and we need not enlarge upon them here.

and adult plumages of both sexes of either species taken from observa-
tions of the living birds.
A few weeks ago a fellow member, the late Mrs. D alton - Burgess, of
Clifton, kindly invited me to examine a new Ring-neck ?5 , which had
been imported by one of our older and original members, Mr. John
Frostick, of London, and who after examining skins at South Kensington
could make it out to be no other than P. Salvadori.
I have kept living specimens of P. torquatus and docilis, P . nepalensis
and most of its subspecies, P. cyanocephala, P. rosa , P. fasciola, P.
longicauda, and have seen alive P. tytleri, P. alexandrina (Javan
Parrakeet), P. derby ana, and P. peristerodes , and am not unfamiliar
with illustrations and in some cases skins of P. nicobarica , P. modesta ,
etc., but my first impression on seeing the subject of these notes
was that it was new to me ; was only second in size to the Alexandrine
(not Spathopterus) Parrakeet, and had peculiar moustache streaks
and cheeks of a hue not seen by me in any of the group before. Since
then I have examined skins at the Museum and they agree with the
bird in so far as adult males are concerned, allowing for loss of colour.
Described from mental imprint I should say, including tail, that the
bird measures full 20 inches. Prevailing colour green. The edges
of the median wing-coverts yellowish, but not presenting so marked
a yellow wing area as in some old specimens of the Banded or Moustache
Parrakeet.
Moustachial streak broad and velvety black, extending from
gape to end of ear-coverts and not tapered off as in some of the species
in the group similarly marked. Feathers of the cheeks from gape to
ear-coverts rich purplish lavender (not unlike the colouring of the
breast band in some male Gouldian Finches) : a thin bridle of black
runs from in front of the eye to the nostril area. Crown and top of the
head bluish green. Nape intensely rich moss green, followed by
greyer green back, mantle, and feathers. Under surface from throat
almost to vent greyish lilacine lavender. Upper mandible orange red,
paler at point and edges; lower mandible black. No vinous line from
back of the ear-coverts down the sides of the neck-coverts noticeable.
Irides golden yellow and narrow, being scarcely noticeable and not
exhibiting that wide pale area and dilatable pupil so marked .in

Allen Silver-Some Notes on a Bare Bing-necked Parrakeet B5
P. eupatria and torquatus. The bill and skull in life conveys a comfortable
rounded outline set on a thick rounded neck, and does not convey
the massive and powerful appearance of the head so noticeable in the
Alexandrine Parrakeet, which is portrayed to the fullest extent in
the subspecies P. magnirostris, hailing from the Andamans.
Referring to P. derbyana Mr. Sclater kindly showed me recently
at South Kensington, a coloured illustration in a book written by
Mr. Hartert, and that agrees pretty well with the living specimens
of derbyana I have seen, and shows a black bill as does the illustration
on Tab 13 in Reichenow's " Papageien ?5 . A pair or two Derbyan
Parrakeets were sketched by the late A. F. Lydon for the Feathered
World some years ago, and the illustration is reproduced in Foreign
Birds for Cage and Aviary by Dr. -A. G. Butler.
Mr. D. Seth-Smith, in his most excellent work Parrakeets , gives
the male of P. derbyana as having the upper mandible red and the female
as having both mandibles black. Dr. Butler gives female as having
the upper mandible red, which as far as I remember of a supposed
living pair was the case. Of the sexed skins of P. salvadori I saw at
South Kensington, the dry mandibles of the males were once apparently
red and the females black and a young male (resembling the adult
female) exhibited signs of the upper mandible changing colour from
black to red.
Mr. Seth-Smith's work, p. Ill, mentions the plate of P. derbyana
by Wolf in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society and Mr. Louis
Fraser's communications. The living Derbyans I saw came from
China, as also did this specimen of P. salvadori .
Little seems to be known of the wild life of these Chinese Parrakeets.
Can our Editor and Mr. Seth-Smith definitely clear up the matter as
to whether Derbyans are or are not hens or immature specimens of
P. salvadori ? In other words, was the first skin described and termed
P. salvadori a handsome old cock Derbyan seen for the first time ?
If, however, there are clear specific differences in sex and young
in both cases the matter should not be difficult to decide, but as
information relating to the matter is so meagre I am not myself clear
whether these birds are entitled to be lumped or hold only subspecific
or racial rank or the differences are only those of age and sex.

Written descriptions of Derby ana do not give prominence to the
extraordinary cheek colour and very broad ended moustachial streak
which forms so conspicuous a feature in the living example of the
bird termed salvadori. The B.M.C. describes the upper&apos; mandible
of derby ana as red (David et Oustalet) \0x25A0 and in the type description
says, " bill black, feet usual Parrakeet colour. 55 Possibly someone
familiar with Chinese birds of the interior may also help us in the
matter.
[The Editor has never seen a true Derbyan Parrakeet. The pair
of birds sold to Mrs. Dalton-Burgess as immature Derbyans did not
agree with the description of the species on reaching maturity: they
were far too small and were wrongly coloured, and appeared to be
only a local race of P. fasciola-- Ed.]

BIRD LIFE NEAR BUENOS AIRES

<bodyText confidence="0.9933576" page_id="56188462"  page_num="36" year="" vol="">
By Bernard E. Potter
It was an impressive event at the end of August last to cross 5# the
line 55 for the first time, to see the sun in the north, and the Southern
Cross by night. Still more impressive the changed face of Nature at
an old estancia 24 miles south of Buenos Aires. Here, close to Hudson's
home, one could get a glimpse of the life he loved so well.
Seen everywhere strutting and bowing in its walk and tame as
a Fowl, is the Hornero or Oven-bird, so-called because of its wonderful
domed mud nest about 9 inches high, which looks like an oven. These
nests are built on ledges about houses, in the fork or bough of a tree,
one I photographed was on a gate at its hinge-end. A long and perilous
drought has just ended with heavy rains. One nest near my window
was being rapidly restarted. I noticed that the bird had in its bill
some stiff material such as a twig coated, with mud. The floor is not
completed before the top and. sides, so soakage by rain is avoided.
When finished the entrance is at the side of the face of the structure,
the other side is closed and infolded, so that there is entire protection
from wind, weather, and natural enemies, nor can one's bent fingers
reach the inside. The season was early spring, leaves just showing,
many birds not yet paired. All the feathered folk seem much more

animated and vociferous than with us. Especially so the Hornero.
It is a treat to watch two greet each other with outstretched, quivering
wings and joyous notes. The bird resembles a plump Thrush ; its
rufous tail is enough for detection.
&apos; The ombii-tree is the chief of the few indigenous trees. A single
tree has numerous trunks emerging from a high raised dais of immense
gnarled roots. The shade cast when in full leaf is a great protection
from the sun&apos;s heat. These trees are unlike any we know, and form
wonderful landmarks. They are often single, but here and there are
in clumps. Most must be of great age. The site of many an estancia
house has been selected for the shade of the ombii. The tree is, I believe,
preserved with superstitious reverence. Wandering about Buenos
Aires I came upon a great ombii at the comer of Once Square, close
to the great and busy Western railway terminus. Many others right
within the city must have lived long before the houses came. On the
naturally almost treeless pampas the ombii has been the home and
shelter of birds, so one has tried to give it some account.
The Yellow House-sparrow is a bright bird with yellow body and
orange front; the hen bird is brown. Driving along the tracks, their
golden hue reminded one of Goldfinch ; near the house their, shacks
of nests were seen in the ombii. The common English House-sparrow
has, alas, come to stay, and often sagaciously makes use of the old
oven-nests.
The Argentine Cow-bird is very striking: black, with purplish
play of colours of the Starling, which it equals in size, the hen being
dun-coloured. These birds are polygamous,- and like the Cuckoos
lay their eggs in other birds&apos; nests. They are vivacious and ubiquitous.
The males seem to outnumber the females. One afternoon I watched
many following the plough. In the furrows with them and Black-
headed Gulls were also numbers of Jay-like birds, very quaint in many
ways, with long tails and yellow bills and head feathers slightly plumed.
They were the Guira Cuckoos, called by \0x25A0 some Magpies. They are
about 15 inches long and wander about in trailing flocks. On little
provocation they make a great complaining chatter, and love to clamber
about piles of sticks or clumps of bushes.
Much of. my observation could happily be made on horseback,

which gave one the advantage of a nearer approach than on foot.
The usual paces are a slow hand-canter or a walk. The native horse
can keep up this easy canter for miles without effort, and it is peculiarly
suited where roads are mere tracks and horses 5 feet unshod.
Often I passed Hudson&apos;s home, crossing on the way a sluggish
stream or arroyo frequented by Marsh Birds. It was here, I am
informed, that the great naturalist made many of his observations.
Browny-black birds, sometimes in flocks, were always passed, wading
in the water or on the banks. They resemble Curlews except in colour,
have long legs, and long down-curved bills and slender bodies. I
learnt that the names for these birds is Cuervo. They also show the
curious disparity in size of the Curlew, some tall, some short. They
were very tame.
Perching on the long rush stems I saw the lovely Yellow-shouldered
Marsh Bird; except for the bright gold colour of the shoulder the
plumage is black, the female is brown. Another bird of the marshes,
also seen in the montes (small woods), is the Silverbill. This bird is
a little smaller ; also black except the bill, which is of palest yellow
colour and also the raised ridge round the eyes and line from eyes
to bill. In flight the wings are white, but at rest black, due to the
peculiar overlap of the feathers, which are black at the bases and tips.
The marshes contained many of the Paraguayan Snipe. It interested
me to watch one bird quite half mile away to windward soaring and
descending, at each descent producing a sound resembling that of
a far distant express train. Another marsh bird, the Greater Yellow-
shanks, was constantly, seen in company with smaller Waders. The
Spur-winged Lapwing, or Tern Tern, has a very aggressive mien.
I saw them mostly in twos or threes. The noise they set up reminds
one of that of Guinea Fowl or a flock of Geese. They are larger than
our Lapwing, have more intense colourings, and are very bold.
During my last ride past the marshes I had the luck to see pairs
of the beautiful many-coloured Marsh Tyrant, or Kinglet, the size of
Marsh Tits. They had probably just arrived and were very active
flitting about the lower part of the reeds. The most conspicuous
colours were black, white, yellow, and red. The light was not too
good,, but the red beneath the tail I took note of.

Our estancia house with its gardens and trees is a great centre
for birds in a country which is naturally almost treeless. The woods
consist chiefly of the tree of heaven--Paradiso. This grows well,
makes excellent firewood, and is proof against the attack of locusts.
Locusts were beginning to appear singly, about 2J inches long. I
remember watching one in flight high in the air. At points along the
line different birds would fly up as if to capture it, but would look at
it then leave it.
The groups of tall, evergreen trees are mostly eucalyptus, forming
excellent landmarks. In height and shape they take the place of our
elms. Peach-trees are in full bloom, and orange- and lemon-trees
heavily laden with fruit.
The House Wren is very like our own species, the song is not so
stirring and lacks the trill; it is seen much in the woods as well
as about houses.. The Pigmy Dove, locally called " Palomita " or
" Tortolita ", is very tame and attractive. It is of a dun colour, but
in flight light feathers of the tail show up. As it sets off to fly it has
a curious roll so typical of the Doves. In the woods there had just
arrived the Larger Spotted Dove, or " Torcasa Four large dots
can be counted upon the wing when at rest. I saw no Wood-Pigeons
but great flocks of House-Pigeons. In our square-built dovecote,
with Pigeon-holes on the entire inner faces of four walls, I calculated
over 2,000 could be accommodated. The young birds are much used
for the table.
The Calandria Mocking-bird is nearly the size of a Magpie. It
has the same long tail and habit of making loops of flight from the
ground. It is full of fun and very interesting to watch. The head
and body resemble in colour those parts in a Grey Shrike, but the long
tail--which can be spread like a fan---is characteristic. Martins and
Swallows arrived during our visit in the middle of September. The
Martin is larger than the Swallow. The black and white of the former
and the forked tail of the latter were the chief noticeable points. The
birds were wont to perch on the small branches of the ombu. However,
as the weather grew suddenly colder they disappeared, although old
nests under the eaves had been visited.

the sprightly Chingolo or Song Sparrow. His song is delightful. He
takes the place of the Chaffinch and sings all day. The note consists
of four sounds, the second higher than the others and the fourth
a trill. The head has a little crest and the sides of neck rufous
patches.
Wherever one may be, in or out of the house, the cry of
the " beinteveo " (I see you well) can always be heard. He is a bold
bird of the size of a Thrush, with a black and white head and bright
yellow under parts. I tried with field-glasses to see a yellow line on
the crest of the head. However, one day I chanced happily to watch
two birds close by fly in the air displaying to each other, and then
saw how a gorgeous golden-coloured cap expands over the whole head.
The " bienteveos " cry enabled me to see, then hear, this bird right in
Buenos Aires high up in the trees close to the Plaza Hotel, and again
in the gardens by the quayside at Rio.
Owls are numerous, but in our part only the variety known as
the Burrowing Owls. They are very active by day, are usually in
pairs, often sitting close together on one of the conical ant-hills.
One afternoon, whilst walking towards some swampy ground I
saw a large bird like a Buzzard flying low. Its general colour was very
dark with light cheeks and under parts. Later, I noticed a dog rolling
on his back. Going up to the spot I came upon the freshly killed head-
end of a reddish-brown crop-eared sharp-toothed animal which I learnt
to be a Huron. The bird had evidently just killed and partially
eaten the animal. I was told that the bird was a Carancho. A very
common bird of prey is the Chimango, a large Hawk of light drab colour,
with broad light bands across the tail and wings as seen when these
parts are expanded in flight. It beats the ground like a Harrier, but
does not look at all formidable for its size. I saw many, but never
noted any of the dash of the Sparrow-hawk or pounce of the Kestrel,
though both the latter are smaller. I have seen Chimangos with
Black-headed Gulls and other Waders at the edges of the ponds, or
lagunas (the local name).
It was not long before I flushed the Spotted Tinamu, generally
known as a Partridge. This bird is solitary, does not fly unless almost
trodden upon, then gets away with a great speed in a straight line.

It is very tame and can be easily made out by its long neck running
in the grass and biding behind tussocks.
In the paddocks near the house were three Crested Screamers,
known by the natives as Chajas. Though well able to fly they spent
most of their time near their adopted home, and would even allow
themselves to be handled. At the fine Zoological Gardens at La Plata,
I came upon three of these great birds, being attracted by their loud
screams. Their concert was a weird one to witness.
In the paddocks also was a fine old male Ostrich, the last of a flock
which had been brought from South Africa. The smaller native
Ostriches, or Rheas, which used to be common in these parts, have now
disappeared into the interior, where the ranchers tell me they are still
very numerous.
Alas ! my holiday was all too brief to let me watch for the many
migrants due to arrive very soon, including the Humming-birds.

It is a common complaint among visitors to the Riviera that there
are no birds. Flowers there are in abundance, both wild and cultivated,
but there seem to be few birds, and those difficult to see.
It must be admitted that on the Promenade des Anglais at Nice,
or round the bridge tables at the various English clubs, there are
very few birds to be seen. But the Riviera, both French and Italian,
includes wooded hills, wide river beds, rocky cliffs, and sandy shores
where, if you sit still, you can see and study birds of all kinds.
Some visitors are disappointed with the number of birds they
see, because they usually leave for England before April and May,
when many birds arrive from Africa.
. A few notes, therefore, on some of the birds which have been seen
and identified along the Italian Riviera may be of interest. It is
only right and proper to begin with the Golden Eagle, the king of
birds, and a passage in Riviera Nature Notes by " C. C." tells us
that in the spring of 1898 a postman going from Sospel to a neigh-
bouring village was attacked by Eagles and so seriously injured that

he died not long afterwards. However this may he, Eagles are not
uncommon in the mountains that enclose the Riviera on the north,
and I saw two that had been shot fairly recently, one near Valdieri
and one in the mountains above Taggia in the Argentina Valley. I also
saw another in captivity which had been taken from the nest when
young.
The Griffon Vulture is said to nest near Tenda, and I saw a specimen
in a private collection at Bordighera.
Among the Hawks the Sparrow-hawk and Kestrel are not uncommon,
and the Peregrine Falcon, though rare, has been seen and, alas ! shot.
The Plovers include the Stone Curlew or Norfolk Plover, with
his large pale yellow eye and lifelong habit of trying to evade notice ;
the Green Plover, or Lapwing, here as in England the devourer of
countless wire-worms and other insect pests ; the Ringed Plover,
found in flocks along the shore; and the Golden Plover (with sharp
pointed wings unlike the rounded wings of the Green Plover) on the
rough hillsides.
Ptarmigan, seldom found below 2,000 feet, inhabit the mountain
ranges of San Remo, while the Blackcock is met with on the lower
slopes. At the mouths of such rivers as the Nervia and the Roya,
Woodcock and Snipe find the soft mud from which they extract worms,
on which they feed ; and the Avocet, scooping with upturned bill
from side to side in shallow pools, has also been observed.
On the same stretch of shore you may see, in May, the Oyster-
catcher's bright orange legs and bill ; and the Little Stint, whose
home is in Arctic Europe, is an occasional visitor. The Curlew, nesting
on the uplands, makes periodical visits to the shore in search of
Crustacea ; and the Great Crested Grebe, though rare, is not unknown
in the Nervia Valley.
On the rough, heath-covered hills above Bordighera, the mysterious
Night-jar lays her two eggs on the bare ground, and escapes notice
by day by sitting lengthwise on the bough of a fir-tree. The Wryneck,
or Cuckoo's Mate, may be seen in Spring whipping up with its long
and sticky tongue the ants of which it is so fond.
Should you stay so late as May, you ought to see the Hoopoe raising
his tawny crest as he alights on the ground ; and, before now, in

Bordighera gardens, a gleam of gold and black among the evergreen
oaks has revealed the Golden Oriole.
The Kingfisher flits--a living sapphire--along the banks of the
Nervia, and the merry Dipper boldly plunges in where the stream
is clear, to emerge a moment later and begin a series of bows on a lichen-
covered rock.
Partridge, Pheasant, and Quail are all to be found along the Riviera,
but usually after May ; and the Pratincole, which winters in Africa,
comes over to this district now and then. Along the cliffs you may
look out for Puffins, which breed as far south as Portugal, and for
Razor-bills, which spend half the year, from August to March, at sea-
Among the many Gulls frequenting the coast, the commonest
are the Black-headed, the Lesser Black-backed, and the Kittiwake
Gull. This last has great power of sustained flight, and ringed Gulls
have been known to accompany liners across the Atlantic. The Duck
family do not appear to be so very numerous in this district, but among
the Diving Ducks found on the Riviera are the Tufted Duck, and the
Red-crested Pochard, while the Teal, Mallard, and Shelduck represent
the surface-feeding Ducks.
The Black-winged Stilt is conspicuous among shore-frequenting
birds, and among other long-legged Waders are the Heron, the Night
Heron, the Glossy Ibis, and the Crane. This last is a rare visitor
from Africa, but the Night Heron appears to be as common here as
the ordinary Heron is in suitable localities in the British Isles,
I also noticed a Bittern, but was given to understand that they
are uncommon.
The Ruff and the Reeve are to be met with occasionally, and I have
seen specimens both in Italian and French collections of birds. The
House Martin, Swallow, and Alpine Swift are all well known along
the Riviera, though the Alpine Swift naturally is seldom seen away
from the Alpes Maritimes. The bird which you are perhaps most
likely to notice on your arrival is the Blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla),
whose liquid melody charms the ear as much as his slender grey form,
crowned with black, pleases the eye.
Among other warblers you will hear the Chiff-chaff, even if you
do not see him, and the Willow Wren and Garden Warbler sustain
a thin but melodious under-current of song.

The Golden-crested Wren, the smallest of European birds, and
one ever heedless of the onlooker, may often be seen carefully searching
the branch of some fir-tree for the insects that his eye alone could
detect; I have watched them more than once within two hundred yards
of a main road. The Tits to be met with include the Great Tit, Blue
Tit, and Long-tailed Tit; and not long ago, near Bormes-les-Mimosas,
I watched the lively movements of the Crested Tit (Pams cristatus).
Thrushes include the Mistle Thrush, Song Thrush, Fieldfare, and the
Blue (or solitary) Thrush, which loves to perch " all alone upon the
house-top
On the surface of the precipitous cliffs of the Roya Valley has been
seen the beautiful grey and rose-coloured plumage of the Wall-creeper
(Teichodroma muraria) whose true home is in the Swiss Alps, and
he is worth going far to see.
Over the same valley the Buzzard and the Kite occasionally float
on broad pinions, and a specimen of the former was added this year
to the private collection I have mentioned before.
The Spotted Ely-catcher is abundant everywhere, and both Grey
and Pied Wagtails can be seen running nimbly in pursuit of insects
along the margin of almost any stream.
In May, the bright-hued Bee-eater may be looked for, a visitor
from Southern Spain ; but I could not obtain any evidence of its
nesting in this district.
Two Pelicans, at least, are recorded in Liguria, but it would be
unfair to hold out much hope of seeing this skilful fisher so far from
his native Africa.
The Sedge Warbler is not uncommon in the cane-brakes by the
riverside, and one specimen of the Penduline Tit, a wanderer from
Southern France, was obtained near Bordighera. The Redstart
is plentiful, and only a short time ago I met a visitor who had watched
the Dartford Warbler sufficiently long to be sure of the identity of
that shy lover of the gorse. With the familiar Green and Great Spotted
Woodpeckers, the Robin, Blackbird, Jay, Starling, and Jackdaw
I will bring these notes to an end in the hope that they may induce
visitors to this pleasant land of sunshine to extend the list, which is
by no means exhaustive, from their own observation.

I had a great treat in May this year. Mrs. Dalton-Burgess very
kindly allowed me to see her wonderful collection of rare Foreign Birds.
They are perfectly beautiful. I had heard about them, but when I saw
them I was like the Queen of Sheba who, when she saw the glories of
Solomon, said, " Behold, the half was not told me." I wish all our
members could have seen them. I cannot remember the names of many,
the Lories in particular. When I think of them, all I can see is a perfect
blaze of gorgeous colours. They were so very well cared for that although
there were a great many there was not even the slightest birdy smell: the
air was sweet and fresh. They were in aviaries and cages all in spotless
condition. Mrs. Dalton-Burgess lived in a charming house furnished
with exquisite taste; at the top of the house there is an enormous
room, which was full to overflowing with the most lovely and valuable
birds. It is beyond my powers to describe them as they deserve, but
I felt I should like to write a few words about them for our Magazine.
I do not know which struck me most. The Hyacinthine Macaw that
lived in a little room by himself, and dances and sings and eats Brazil
nuts as if they were bananas, or a sweet little White Cockatoo about as
big as a Grey Parrot and so tame that he snuggles up against your
neck like a baby, or a Whistling Crow that loves to lie on the floor of
his cage and have his chest rubbed ! Or a young Blackcap, the first
to be bred in captivity. Then there are crowds of magnificent Parrakeets,
Kings, Common Lories, Queen Alexandras, Rock Peplars, Adelaides,
Rosellas, Mealy and Redheaded Rosellas, Pennants, and many lovely little
birds such as Gouldian Finches, Weavers, etc. I cannot think of half
of them. Then we came to the Budgerigars, a perfect feast of colour.
The beauty of the deep blue, the delicate loveliness of the pale blue,
the quiet and fascination of the greys with black or white margins, the
rather sombre olives, or the cheerful yellows and greens of ordinary
kinds all in faultless condition, it was delightful to see them. I was
three hours having all these treasures shown to me, and I should
have liked to have begun over again ! I came away after being fortified

for my journey with a most delightful tea and feeling that I could
never thank Mrs. Dalton-Burgess enough for the pleasure she had given
me. I must just say to end that when I reached home and went into
the garden and saw my own aviary, about 16 feet long, with a few
Budgerigars, I felt still more like the Queen of old, for there was no
more spirit left in me. I have got over that feeling now, and am
gradually getting a few more birds. I have now Peaceful and Diamond
Doves, and some day hope for Blue Budgerigars !

[Concluded from p. 16.)
The foods I use for all my birds are the same. I use my own
insectile mixture--" Life This I put into a basin and use boiling
water, not cold : a little poured over it, and then stirred with
a fork. If not sufficient, I add more until it is fairly moist; not sloppy 7 .
I then press it down and leave it for a short time, after which I stir
it again, and find that the food has absorbed the boiling water and it
is all beautifully crumbly and moist. I then use a milk cheese called
" Little Wilts " (all grocers keep it). I use a piece over which I have
sprinkled a little powdered biscuit and chop it fine like suet, the
biscuit preventing the cheese from sticking to the knife, in the pro-
portion of one small teaspoonful to every tablespoonful of insectile
food. The cheese sounds a peculiar food for a bird to eat: there is no
" Little Wilts Cheese " for them in the wild state ; quite true, but,
.however this may be, it is a food that the birds are fond of and is most
nourishing without being fattening, and easily digested, quite the
reverse of ordinary cheese, and curiously enough it is the first artificial
food (if I may use the term) that a bird first caught will pick out.
This preparation I call the staple food, and as I have always found
the birds do so well upon it, I am content to leave well alone.
It is easy enough to mix a lot of ingredients together and give it

How to Keep Insectivorous Birds in Perfect Condition 47
to birds as a staple food, but there is one thing that has to be remembered
--there are fat-forming foods and foods that do not make undue fat.
If a wild bird is caught and its bodily condition examined, it will
be found that it is plump and well covered with flesh, with a little
fat at the base of the neck or commencement of breast; but a bird
in cage, if fed on too stimulating or fat-forming food, is bound to
suffer sooner or later, and this is what takes place. The bird, after
a time, puts on a great deal of fat externally. Later it cannot put more
on externally, so it gradually gets fat internally, and the result is
that the exertion in flying from one perch to the other often results
in the bird falling on the floor in a fit. These fits often occur one after
the other ; each fit undermines the bird's constitution and a severe
one takes place, the bird dropping stone dead. It will be found that
ifc has ruptured a small blood vessel on the brain or in the region of the
heart.
Exercise is the outlet for superfluous fat, which the wild bird, of
course, is able to get; therefore, when in confinement, it must have
a nourishing but not a fat-forming diet.
Live diet is very essential. I have been asked if half-a-dozen
mealworms a day is sufficient for one bird ; I may at once say it is not.
An insectivorous bird when at liberty is devouring insects at intervals
from sunrise to sunset; therefore, it is quite obvious that it is not
sufficient to give six mealworms.
This is how I feed mine. After I have placed the staple food in
their tins I give each bird four mealworms killed and cut in halves
first thing in the morning ; again at noon, and the same at about
five p.m. in the evening. This is during the short days of winter.
In addition, I give two or three wasp grubs.
In the long days from April to August I feed four times per day--
at 8 a.m., 12 o'clock, 5 p.m., and their last feed about dusk.
I give, during April and May, as live food, mealworms only, as the
wasp grubs are at an end by this time, being used up during winter, and
there is nothing else until the fresh ants' cocoons are in season, which
is from the first week in June until end of August. I then dispense
with mealworms to a great extent, only giving them twice per week
as a change of diet.

P. F. M. Galloway --
If I could get fresh live ant cocoons all the year round, I should
use very few mealworms, for I consider the former the finest live diet
of all, and so do the birds ; and the feeding round, where many birds
are kept, takes less than half the time.
In an aviary, instead of having to prepare the food with meal-
worms, all that is necessary is to stir in a couple of handfuls of ants'
cocoons, every bird gets its fair share of live food, whereas if given
mealworms they often do not. A. bird will swoop down and eat more
than its share, and some of the others have to go short and sometimes
get none.
Where birds have nests of young in an aviary and partake of live
food, the young do exceedingly well during the fresh ants' egg-time.
I have not had much experience with foreign birds, but have had
some, and although they may be seed-eaters they will eat with relish
my insectile food.
My Blue Budgerigars devour it greedily, and go straight to their
young and feed them, and I could not wish birds to grow and feather
more rapidly.
I have also three (Yuhinias) Indian Crested Tits. When I first
had them they lived on Nestle's milk and honey mixed with warm
water, and fresh, live ants' cocoons.
They now eat the wasp grubs and insectile food well, and are in
perfect health and condition.
I have mentioned this to show that insectile food is a fine change
of diet from everlasting seed, just in the same way that ants' cocoons
and wasp grubs are a welcome change from the everlasting mealworm
in feeding insectivorous birds.
The Blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla)
This bird is another excellent songster and one very easy to keep.
A Blackcap that will sing some of the Nightingale notes mingled
with its own, I consider beats the Nightingale. I have, on a few
occasions, heard a Blackcap in the height of the singing season pour
out several liquid notes of the Nightingale song, so perfectly that
had I not seen the bird actually in the act of doing so quite close to me,
I should never have believed it could imitate so accurately.

How to Keep Insectivorous Birds in Perfect Condition 49
A hand-reared bird will, like the Nightingale, begin to warble in
undertone long before it is full-grown. In the nests all the young
have light chocolate brown caps, but to an experienced eye the cocks
can be picked out easily from the hens ; in the latter, the cap is lighter
in colour and the breast more buff than in the opposite sex. A young
cock bird has the cap deep brown, in some cases quite three shades
deeper, and the breast lighter and more of a very pale, silvery grey,
with throat also much lighter than a hen.
The Blackcap will thrive and live to a good age, if properly fed
and attended to.
I have known them arrive in mild seasons in my county so early
as 27th March, their usual time being about the end of the first week
in April.
In regard to their nest, some are very badly built. I have found
nests so flimsy and badly attached to the briars that as soon as the
young were large enough to show quills the nest has given way and
the whole lot destroyed. But birds do not cry because their young
have been lost or taken, wdiether by human hands or vermin ; neither
do they weep because their eggs have been taken, any more than the
fowl weeps because its egg has been taken for the breakfast table,
yet this trash has been written, which is most misleading to those
who know little about birds.
Instead of fretting, they commence, often within a few days, to
build again, so that in reality they have simply been delayed. Not
that I am advocating for one moment the wholesale taking of nests;
far from it.
I have seen children destroying nests, and many a lecture I have
given them, and nearly lost my temper over it. They simply, in
country places on their way to school, pull out the nests they find.
It does not matter if they are even only half-built, out they have to
come, to be kicked about the road like a football. They take the
eggs for the sheer love of destroying, without rhyme or reason. They
have no cabinet in winch they could have just one clutch of each
species, where they could be learning something interesting about
birds. It is simply wilful destruction. I only hope that the children
are not of the same destructive habits in other parts as they are about
here in my locality.

I consider that the children about here at any rate are as destructive
to the birds as the vermin, and their parents should help to put a
stop to it.
Birds do not fret over the loss of their eggs or young, as I said
before. I have proved this over and over again. Only this season
I knew a Nightingale's nest in a narrow underwood, she had been
incubating four days when her eggs were destroyed by field-mice.
This happened on the 20th May. The birds moved up the underwood
about one hundred yards away from the spot where the nest had been
destroyed, and by the 20th June she had her second nest containing
four young about 3 days old. She had actually built, laid her
clutch of eggs, and hatched all under a month. Unfortunately these
were also all destroyed by vermin a week after I found them, and
as the season was so far advanced, she would not build again--at
any rate, I should very much doubt it.
It is no trouble to keep a Blackcap in confinement, as so much
of its natural food can be found, not for a few weeks only, but nearly
the whole year round.
This species is a great lover of berries, and although it will eat
fruit, berries of various kinds are its favourite ; this, of course, in
addition to its natural insect food ; like the Garden Warbler it eats
both insects and berries.
The first food this bird seeks out on arrival in this country in
regard to berries, are those of the ivy. This would be in early April;
they are then ripe. After these are over, they feed on insects of various
kinds until the wild raspberry is ready about June, and later in the
year on elderberries.
They will hang about in the neighbourhood of elder bushes when
the berries are ripe for some considerable time, in fact, right up to
the time of migration, feeding almost wholly on these.
The cage suited for a Blackcap should be rather smaller than for
a Nightingale : one about 18 inches long by 12- |inches high by
9 inches deep.
From the nature of their food (fruit and berries) the floor of their
cage requires to be cleaned regularly every day.
They should be fed on the insectile mixture exactly like the

Nightingale, also upon the live food described for that bird, and, in
addition, berries.
In April they can have ripe ivy berries ; when these are over,
give a small piece of banana or sweet pear : then when the raspberries
are ripe, substitute these for the banana and pear. In August, or as
soon as the elderberries are ripe, let the bird have these as long as they
can be got, for they love them. They would be over by about the
middle of October, and before very long, the privet berries will be
ripe, and these will last until about February.
It will be seen from this that a great deal of the Blackcap's food,
in regard to berries and fruit, can be obtained nearly all the year round.
Blackberries they do not care for, and I have never known them in
the wild state to touch them.

Sturnia sturnina. " Daurian Starlet." " A male purchased
in June, 1916, kept in good health until the autumn, when it sickened
and died. It was a cheerful little bird and sang often, the song
being occasionally harsh, but containing many melodious notes. It
was very cleanly and very fond of bathing, keeping its plumage so
free from dirt that when it died it w^as difficult to tell from the
made-up skin that it was a cage-bird. This bird's favourite food
seemed to be bread and milk. It also ate millet and raw beef,
but did not care for fruit or grasshoppers. However, when plants
covered with aphides were placed in the cage, it picked these off
with evident pleasure." La Touche. Birds of N.E. Chihli. 1920,

Hitherto, the only hen recorded as imported is a hen King bird,
which died the day after reaching Sir Wm. Ingram's aviary. Ex

New Birds of Paradise at the Zoo ; brought by C. B. Horsbrugh.
Seven Raggi's, seven Lawes', eight Hunstein's, four Manucodes
(Phonygama purpureo-violacea and chalybeata), one New Guinea
Rifle-bird (Ptilorhis intercedens), three Black-headed Cat-birds
(Mluroedus melanocephalus) , two Sub-alar Bower-birds ( Amblyornis
subalaris ). 1908, 636, and 1909, 209.
The following reached the Zoo October, 1908 : Five Raggi's,
one Hunstein's, one Rudolf's, seven Lawes', two Yiolet Manucodes,
one New Guinea Rifle-bird, one Black-headed Cat-bird. 1909, 209.
Mr. Horsbrugh writes that after settling down " Live birds,
mammals, and reptiles came in to such an extent that our collapsible
cages were soon filled, and we had to build two large aviaries under
the house . . . Into one of these we turned all the Hunstein's
Birds of Paradise, which soon became tame enough to feed from our

hands ; the other held several sorts of Doves and some Kaggi's
Paradise-birds ... we had never handled such confiding and
fearless creatures as these (Paradise-birds). They would usually
take food from our hands within three days of their capture.
The Hunstein's were decidedly more delicate than the other
species, but usually agreed very well amongst themselves when
caged."
Later, about a dozen Lawes' Birds of Paradise were obtained.
" Unlike Hunstein&apos;s . . . they were as hardy as we could wish,
and quickly became tame.
Our natives could not appreciate our wish to receive hen Paradise
birds ... We had to offer double rewards for hens of P. raggiana,
and even then we only obtained three specimens."
We also got six Mluroedus melanocephalus, a few Amblyornis
subalaris and Phonygama purpureo-violacea, and one Ph. chalybeata.
"The first-named were delicate and we had very great difficulty in
keeping a couple of females alive ; but the Manucodes were as strong
as Parotia lawesi, and soon developed murderous tendencies towards
each other, necessitating separate cages."
A single Lophorhina minor obtained but it had been too roughly
treated by the natives and it did not live. C. B. Horsbrugh.
To Brit. New Guinea for Paradise Birds. 1909, 209.

WARBLERS AND SMALL INDIGENOUS
TURDIDIA

The family of Warblers, or Sylvidce, is subject to frequent
modifications at the hands of classifiers because it contains side by side
several species of birds which are anatomically nearly allied, but differ
widely in their habits and behaviour. For the sake of simplicity they
are here divided into three groups. Warblers proper, Aquatic Warblers,
and Wood Wrens.
I. Warblers properly so called
The true Warblers live in woods, hedges, and gardens. They
are very lively, flitting unceasingly from bush to bush, and rarely
descend to the ground. They are insectivorous and frugivorous,
and very fond of fruit and berries. Their song is rather loud, agreeable,
and varied. They build slight cup-shaped nests of dried grass, and lay
four to six oval eggs which are nearly always spotted.
Warblers are quickly tamed and soon become accustomed to
captivity, they are long lived, and breed readily. They should be fed
on insectivorous mixture, a little crushed hemp, a few mealworms,
ants' eggs, and fruits and berries in their season, such as elder or
service berries, etc.

The Blackcap ( Sylvia atricapilla) is olive brown above and ashen
grey beneath, the male has a black cap and the female a reddish one.
It inhabits the greater part of Europe, North Africa, and Asia Minor.
This common Warbler is one of our most melodious songsters, and
in consequence much sought after by amateurs.
The Garden Warbler (S. simplex) is olive brown above with a
whitish throat, breast and flanks russet grey. The female is like
the male, only slightly paler. It is found throughout Europe except
in the extreme North, Asia Minor, and Persia, and passes the winter
in North Africa. It is a sweet songster, its notes soft and flute-like and
very varied.
The Lesser Whitethroat (S. curruca ) has the top of the head ashen,
its nape, back, and rump are ashy brown, wings and tail brown,
white beneath. The female is rather duller. Like the above-
mentioned, it is widely distributed and common in the same countries.
This Warbler owes its name to its continual lively but monotonous
twittering.
The Orphean Warbler (S. orphea). Head dark brown, body
olivaceous above, whitish below, wings dark grey, tail brown with the
outer feather partly white. The female slightly redder, wings and
tail of a lighter brown. It inhabits Central and Southern Europe
also North Africa. This is a large Warbler (length 17 cm.), and one of
our most lively songsters ; the Germans call it " master of tongues ",
and it certainly does imitate the song of several other birds.
The Grey Warbler (S. communis). Crown and cheeks ashy grey
tinted reddish, wings blackish, throat pure white, breast faintly pink.
The female's breast is russet rather than pink, and her throat is not
so white. It is found throughout Europe and winters in Africa.
A very common species, very lively in its ways.
The Subalpine Warbler (S. subalpina). Ashy grey above, more
or less bluish on the head and neck, breast chestnut, belly whitish,
wings and tail brown. A white streak separates the grey head from
the red lower face. It inhabits the southern countries of Europe,
and lives on rocky ground among brushwood ; its song resembles
that of the Grey Warbler.
The Spectacled Warbler (S. conspicillata) . Head ashy blue, back

ashy red, throat white, breast vinous red, lighter on the belly. Lores
and round the eyes black, eyelids white. The female is duller. It
inhabits Southern Europe and Northern Africa, is much rarer than the
preceding species, but has the same habits.
The Barred Warbler (S. nisoria). Dark grey above, throat white,
belly whitish with brown transverse blotches. The female darker
above, and having the abdominal marking less pronounced. Inhabits
Central Europe from the Baltic to Italy, not common in France,
winters in Africa. This bird and the Orphean Warbler are the largest
of the family, and they both mimic the songs of other birds.
The Black-headed Warbler ( S . melanocephala) . Black-headed,
body dark grey above, greyish white beneath, becoming russet brown
on the sides of the body, eyelids reddish. The female has the crowm
of the head dark grey. Inhabits the Mediterranean Basin, Asia Minor,
and North Africa.
Riippell's Warbler (S. rupjpelli). Crown of the head, throat,
and front part of neck black ; white beneath with a pink tinge in the
middle of the abdomen. A white stripe from the beak to the neck.
The female has no black, and her colour is more ashy. This pretty
species is found in Greece, Asia Minor, and the east of North Africa
in winter.
Here may be mentioned another little bird of modest plumage
and insignificant song, the Dartford Warbler ( M . undata), which is
only found in waste places, mountainous spots, and a lover of brambles
and heaths, inhabiting the south and west of Europe. Various sub-
species are found in England, in the west of France, and in Corsica.
This family also contains a bird which is not commonly met with in
France, the Rufous Warbler (Agrabates galactodes), with reddish
plumage and a bright red tail. These two uncommon birds are
without interest to the amateur.
II. Aquatic Warblers
Reed Warblers differ from the above in their abode and habits.
They live in damp places, on the banks of ponds and watercourses.
They run about on the ground hopping amongst and climbing reeds,
build their nests among the stems of aquatic plants, and feed exclusively

on insects. Their song is varied, and with some exceptions more noisy
than tuneful.
In captivity these birds require care and special feeding. As
many insects as possible should be added to the best soft-bill mixture.
If they are kept in a small aviary it is a good plan to plant clumps
of reeds round the drinking fountain, or failing these some upright
bars. I will only mention the best known species.
The Icterine Warbler ( Hypolais icterina). Greenish brown above,
wings and tail brown, bordered yellowish grey, bright yellow beneath,
a yellow streak on either side of the forehead. It inhabits Europe
and winters in Africa.
The Melodious Warbler (H. polyglotta). Above olive brown, wings
and tail brown, edged with olive, very bright yellow beneath, a yellowish
streak on each side of the forehead. The habit which this species
has of imitating the songs of other birds has gained it the name
of " the counterfeiter ".
The Great Reed Warbler ( AcrocejpJialus arundinaceus) . Olive brown
above, slightly tinted with russet, whitish below; a faint streak above
the eye, and a circle round the eye yellowish white. Inhabits the
North and South of Europe and Northern Africa. This very common
Warbler forms a link between the Blackbirds and the Warblers. It is
a rather large bird (19 cm.). Other nearly allied species differ very
slightly from the preceding, they have the same habits and live in the
same places; for instance, the Reed Warbler (A. streperus) and the
Marsh Warbler (A. palustris).
The Sedge Warbler (A. schoenobcenus) and the Aquatic Warbler
(A. aquaticus) closely resemble the above. They show great agility
in running among and climbing reeds and water plants ; their song
is not unpleasing and they sing by night as well as day.
The Grasshopper Warbler (Locustella ncevia) has the upper parts
of the body olive shaded with brown with oval blackish spots in the
centre of its feathers, the under parts are ashy white with small brown
spots on the throat and narrow yellowish eye-streaks. It inhabits
Central and Southern Europe and winters in Africa. This charming
little bird always hides itself; it has a curious song which much
resembles the sounds made by grasshoppers or crickets. Absolutely

insectivorous, in order to keep it alive in captivity it must for some
time be fed only on insects and very gradually be got on to an
insectivorous food of the choicest kind.
Among other Locustellse which are found in Europe and have
the same habits, I will mention Locustella jluviatilis, luscinioides,
certhiola, lanceolata. These birds are all so much alike that to describe
one is to describe all.
III. The Wood Wrens
Wood Wrens are small birds (11 to 12 cm.), which all have the same
way of living and the same manners. They are lively, active, and
quick ; they jump about perpetually moving their wings and tails ;
their song is not particularly varied, but serves to distinguish the
different species. Their domed spherical nests with the opening
at the side are fairly large and generally built on the ground. These
little birds do well in captivity, they make delightful pets, and require
plenty of insects with their food.
The Chiff-chaff ( Phylloscopus collybita) is olive brown above,
yellowish-white spotted with yellow beneath, and has yellow eye-
streaks. It inhabits Central and Western Europe and winters in
Africa, as do also the following:--
The Willow Wren (P. trochilus) greenish grey above, yellowish
below, eye-streak yellow.
The Bonelli's Willow Wren (P. bonnelli). Above, greyish olive,
the rump more or less yellow, under parts whitish, eye-streak white.
The Wood Wren (P. sibilatrix) . Greenish above, under parts
sulphur yellow paling to white below the breast. Europe and more
particularly Asia possess many other species of Wood Wrens, which
all have the same habits. They are naturally confiding and allow
themselves to be closely approached. It is easy to watch them moving
among thin woodland and hedges ; you will first hear the bird, and
perhaps you will think that it is some way off, but all the time it is
close to you just above your head, but practically invisible in its green
and yellow plumage, which is so well adapted to harmonize with the
foliage of the tree which shelters it.

B. The Small Thrushes
I. Redbreasts, Redstarts, and Nightingales
Two groups of birds are included among the Turdidse, together
with Blackbirds and Thrushes, notwithstanding their small size, because
of the many points of resemblance between them. These groups
consist of Redbreasts, Redstarts, Bluethroats, and Nightingales
on the one hand, and Chats and Wheatears on the other. They are
sometimes called miniature Turdidse, because in their habits, ways
of living, and general characteristics they strongly resemble Blackbirds.
Like them they are lively, gluttonous, and run rapidly over the ground,
often quivering their tails meanwhile.
These birds are all charming in captivity, their song is marvellous,
and their plumage beautiful; also they become very tame. It is,
however, essential to keep them by themselves, two cock birds should
never be put together, even different species which are of the same
colour. In order to enjoy the melody of the best singers among them,
they should always be kept in a separate cage.
The Redbreast (Erithacus rubecula) is one of our best known and
best loved birds. Clad in olive brown on the upper part of the body,
his belly is silvery wdiite ; and he derives his name from his handsome
orange red breastplate. The female may be known by her paler
colouring and smaller size. This is always an extremely tame bird
even in the wild state, and very inquisitive when, standing very upright
on his delicate feet he looks intelligently at one out of his large expressive
eyes. In captivity he should be given a mixture, wdth berries, meal-
worms, and table scraps, for which he will thank you throughout
the year with his cheerfulness and his sw~eet melancholy song. They
have bred in aviaries ; some people have even succeeded in obtaining
a cross between the Redbreast and Hedge-sparrow. The type and
some subspecies inhabit Europe and Asia.
The Redstart (Phcenicurus jphcenicurus) is much desired for a pet,
for to beauty of plumage he joins a charming song. The male has the
crown of the head, the upper part of the neck and body ashy blue,
the forehead, sides of the neck, and throat are beautiful velvety black ;
the rusty red of the breast becomes slightly paler on the flanks only

to blaze brightly in the tail-feathers, and a pure white diadem adorns
the forehead. The female wears a simple russet gown. Of a
melancholy nature and loving solitude, this bird requires careful feeding
and a liberal supply of live insects. It is found throughout Europe
and migrates into Asia and Africa.
The Black Bedstart (P. titys) has the same habits and is found
in Central and South Europe; it requires similar treatment in
captivity. It is not as brilliantly coloured ; the upper parts are
ashy blue, forehead, cheeks, and throat deep black, the tail bright
red. The female is grey, slightly russet above. This species prefers
stony localities and buildings, thus it is often met with in towns. Its
song is not melodious, it utters harsh quick notes and then hurried
cries. It should be noted that these species have a summer and
winter plumage.
Asia possesses some fine species of Bedstarts, as also Northern
Africa. From the latter country I will name the Algerian Bedstart
(Diplootocus moussieri). One of the most delightful birds with the
song and habits of our Bedbreast. It has often been kept in
confinement; our colleague, Dr. Arnault, has some young ones which
he brought back from a recent ornithological journey.
The Bluethroat (Luscinia cyanecula) is much sought after for
the beauty of its plumage and its rarity. The male has a deep brown
back, the belly greyish white, and the throat adorned with a fairly
large patch of beautiful azure blue, in the centre of which shines a
round pure white spot. The female has only a small blue spot on
the throat. The Bluethroat frequents marshy places and ground well
covered with brushwood and osiers. It should be given the same
food in captivity as the Bedstarts. It has a curious song, one might
fancy that one heard two voices, one deep-toned like the sound of a
hurdy-gurdy, the other clearer and more flutelike ; it augments its
song with scraps borrowed from sounds which it is accustomed to
hear ; for instance, one of my Bluethroats imitated the croaking of
tree frogs which were in the same spot.
There is a subspecies ( L . suecisa gaetlcei) in the Norwegian mountains
which has a red spot instead of a white one. All the Bluethroats
occasionally have a spotless blue patch. The type species inhabits

Central and Northern Europe and in winter conies south to Northern
Africa, with a double migration in France.
The Nightingale (Luscinia megarhyncha), king of songsters, wears
a very sober costume ; russet on the back, whitish on throat and belly,
darker on the sides, wings and tail reddish brown. It is difficult to
distinguish the sexes, except in the breeding season when the male
genital parts are very much developed. This, together with the song,
is the only certain distinctive mark. The Nightingale, which comes to
us with the fine weather, chooses woods, shady valleys, and flowery
spots to dwell in. There he marks out his own territory and waits
for a mate, and the pair then busy themselves with their nest. It
inhabits Europe and North Africa.
For lovers of music the Nightingale is the favourite. But the
finding of a perfect songster is quite a matter of chance, for it is a
capricious bird. To buy a Nightingale is a lottery ; young ones taken
from the nest never make the best songsters, not having graduated
in Nature's school. The true Nightingale-lover must catch his bird
himself. This is easy, as the cocks arrive first and sing while waiting
for the hens to come over. Thus one may be certain of having a cock,
and can choose him from among all the songsters around him.
A Nightingale's cage should be entirely shut in at bottom and roofed
with dark canvas ; when first caught, the other sides should be entirely
covered with green baize. It is desirable that the food and drinking
vessels should be so placed as to avoid the necessity for putting one's
hand inside the cage (some German cages are wonderfully well adapted
for the needs of these kinds of birds). It is desirable to decide before-
hand on the most suitable place for the cage, for once in position it
does not do to disturb this capricious bird while he is in song. The food
should consist at first of fresh ants' eggs and mealworms. Later on
the bird can gradually be accustomed to the mixture which will
eventually form its chief food.
II. Stonechats and Wheateabs
These two groups are represented by pretty birds which are much
alike in their habits and food. Stonechats are met with in fields and
cultivated spots, but Wheatears prefer uncultivated stony places or

ploughed fields, but they are alike in their way of living. Both are
fond of perching on salient points, the Chat chooses a bare bough of
a bush and the Wheatear perches on a stone or a clod of earth. In
captivity they delight their owner by their handsome plumage. They
require great care and at first are very wild ; on the other hand, young
birds taken from the nest become charmingly tame. They must have
a food that is very rich in insects, but some kinds of berries please
them. There are many species in Asia and North Africa. I will name
the commonest in Western Europe :--
The Whinchat (Saxicola rubetra) has plumage in which blackish
brown and rust colour predominate ; the eyebrows, lower portion of
the cheeks, throat and sides of the neck are pure white, as well as a
large oblong spot on the wing. The female is like the male, but is more
russet, and the white is replaced by a yellowish tint. It is a common
bird with a fairly sweet song. It summers in Europe and winters
in Africa.
The Stonechat ( S . rubicola ) is a little smaller, and is prettily marked
with cap, breastplate, and tail black, the breast and sides red brown.
The female is blackish brown with a pale rust-coloured breast. It has
the same ways and inhabits the same spots as the preceding.
The Wheatear (CEnanthe oenanthe). The male is blue grey with
eyebrows, forehead, throat, and the middle of the abdomen white, a
wide deep black stripe proceeds from the beak, surrounds the eyes, and
ceases at the nape. The female is ashy brown above, and light rust
colour beneath. This Wheatear is particularly fond of waste places
or ploughed fields, where it loves to perch on a large clod of earth.
In captivity it remains wild and unfriendly for a long time. It is
found throughout Europe and in parts of Asia and Africa.
The Black-eared Wheatear (CE. hispanica) has the crown, the upper
part of the neck and body, the breast and abdomen more or less rusty
white ; the cheeks, throat, wings, and most of the tail deep black. In
the female the white is more rusty and the black is replaced by darkish
brown. The male is a very beautiful bird ino nfinement. It is found
in the south-west of Europe and winters in Africa.
The Pied Wheatear (CE. melanoleuca) is also called the Great Wheatear,
for it measures 19 cm. It is&apos; entirely black except the upper and

lower tail coverts, which are pure white, as well as nearly all the tail
feathers. It is shy and very wary, and its habits remind one of the
Rock Thrush or the Blue Thrush. Like these birds, it leads a solitary
life, perching on a rock and remaining stationary for a very long time.
It inhabits South-Western Europe.

<bodyText confidence="0.997342407407407" page_id="56188504"  page_num="66" year="" vol="">
By J. Delacour and M. Legendre
The Tree-creepers (Certhiidce) remind one a good deal of the Sun-
birds by their long, thin, and curved beaks, but their tongues are
simple and pointed, without a brush, and their feet are adapted to
hold on to the trunks of the trees. They are wholly insectivorous.
Everybody knows the Tree-creeper (Certliia familiaris), which,
with its different varieties, inhabits the whole of the northern hemi-
sphere ; it is a small grey bird, striped with brown.
The Wall-creeper (Tichodroma muraria ), which is found in the
mountains of Europe and of Asia, is one of our prettiest birds ; it is
grey, shaded with black, with the wings marked with bright carmine.
Both have been kept in cages, but this demands a skill which
cannot often be repeated. Mr. E. Plocq writes us on the subject of
these birds as follows :--
" The Tree-creepers are, in my opinion, the most difficult to preserve
of all the small birds (after the Swifts, however). I was never able to
keep them through the winter. I give them meat powder, which I mix
in equal parts with white cheese and fresh ants' eggs. With this food
the Creepers maintain good health, but when there is a shortage of
fresh ants' eggs they die. Neither dried ants' eggs well softened
nor mealworms can replace them.
" I only once possessed a Tichodroma, having captured the adult
myself at the end of October ; I kept it until the end of May. It
would never eat insectile mixture ; I fed it exclusively on cockroaches
and mealworms. It died at the moment when ants' eggs were about
to commence or I should certainly have been able to keep it during
the whole year."

kept in a cage for several years ; it was given, in addition to insects,
insectile mixture and minced meat.

Nuthatches
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999378935483871" page_id="56188505"  page_num="67" year="" vol="">
The Nuthatches are thickset, vigorous, and active birds ; their
characteristics are somewhat intermediate between the Woodpeckers
and the Titmice. They are fairly common and more resident
than migratory; they live alone or in pairs, but never in flocks.
Splendid climbers, the Nuthatches are perhaps still more skilful
than the Woodpeckers, because they show as much facility in climbing
along the trunk of a tree as in descending and stopping head down-
wards to catch an insect or to open a seed.
The Nuthatches are found everywhere except in Africa and in
South America. The European Nuthatch (Sitta europoea) inhabits
Scandinavia and the North of Europe ; the Buff-breasted Nuthatch
(Sitta cosia ) is found over all the rest of Europe; the Whitehead's
Nuthatch in Corsica. In the East of Europe there are two other
species, the Krueper's Nuthatch and the Syrian Nuthatch ; this
latter builds a very remarkable nest.
It is therefore the Buff-breasted Nuthatch which is found in the
West of Europe, where it is widely distributed in our gardens and our
woods. This bird never seems to have any rest; it does not lose a
minute in visiting, without stopping, all the trees of an orchard. It
often commences with the upper branches and, trotting along like a
little mammal, it finally arrives at the bottom of the trunk, and
takes flight to a new tree.
Being very cautious, the Nuthatch usually has several hiding
places where it deposits nuts and beechmast; it is often a crack in
a tree which is found to contain a regular row of nuts. It makes
its nest in the hollow part of a tree, and reduces the opening to its own
size by means of masonry work which it shapes with its sticky saliva.
When this work is once finished, it is very solid.
The well-known plumage of the Buff-breasted Nuthatch is bluish-
grey above, fawn below, with the throat and the cheeks whitish ;
a black line, starting from the beak and passing across the eye, stops

at the neck and separates the bluish-grey of the upper parts from
the reddish fawn of the lower parts.
The Nuthatch consumes a large quantity of insects, but during
the cold season it adds all kinds of seeds to its diet. In captivity
its gaiety, its agility, and its cleverness in hiding its food are its principal
qualities. It must not be enclosed in a cage made of too soft wood?
as this would not resist the strength of its beak, because, like the
Woodpeckers, it has the habit of pecking continually. Its food must
consist of insectile mixture, bread and milk, with walnuts and hazel-
nuts ; it is also very fond of grains of oats, sunflower seed, and hemp
seed, which it takes in large quantities in its beak and arranges them
in rows in the cracks in its cage in order to break them. It requires
a hollow log to spend the night, and one should put at its disposal
branches covered with bark.
The Nuthatch is a fighter, and it is advisable not to associate
it with little birds. As a rule two males should not be put together
they would soon kill each other.
Some exotic Nuthatches have been imported into Europe ; they
do not differ as regards their habits from our native species, and require
the same care in captivity.
The Indian Nuthatch (S. cinnamomeiventris) is bluish grey on the
back, brown below, with a black line starting from the beak, passing
by the eye and finishing at the shoulders, the cheeks and the chin are
white. The S. castaneiventris of the Himalayas only differs from it
by its smaller size.
The Black-fronted Nuthatch (S. frontalis), which is found from
India to the Philippines, is a lovely bird, blue above and a pale rosy
brown below, with a white throat, the forehead and a stripe on the
sides of the head black.
The Golden-crested Wrens
The Golden-crested Wrens are the smallest birds in Europe ; they
owe their name (Roitelets--Kinglets) to the pretty crown of feathers
which they carry on the head. They are gentle, alert, and graceful, and
in many respects resemble the Tits ; like them, they are of wandering
habits. They feed entirely on small insects, larvse, and insect eggs, which

they pick up, continually uttering a little shrill call note ; but they
also have a very gentle and agreeable song.
Like the Tits, the Golden-crested Wrens specially frequent fir and
pine forests. Except in the breeding season, they always live in the
company of their kind, and when the winter has come, when the
birds collect together in bands to search for food, the Wrens join the
Crested and Cole Tits ; sometimes one or two Creepers join this group
and sometimes also a Nuthatch. Nothing is more interesting on a
winter's day than to follow with the field-glass the movements of
such an association of birds. The Golden-crested Wrens build a nest
which is very difficult to find, and is often situated at the end of a
long pine or fir branch.
In captivity these birds require a lot of care ; they are delicate
and only with difficulty become accustomed to a new diet. Several
of them must always be kept together, isolation appears to be fatal
to them. Their food consists of a very good insectile mixture, a
paste which must be very fresh and to which one should always add
mealworms cut into fragments or whole, but in the latter case, very
small. During the summer months, one should also give them fresh
ants' eggs and especially flies. Mr. E. Plocq advises as their diet
a paste composed of meat powder to which half the quantity of heated
cream or white cheese is added, with a little very ripe fruit crushed,
and in addition very small mealworms cut into fragments and a lot of
greenfly when obtainable.
The Golden-crested Wrens should not be kept in a large aviary,
from which they always endeavour to escape by any opening,
abandoning the places where their food is found ; but a cage of
medium size is suitable for them with one or two branches of pine
on which they perch with pleasure ; they roost there every night
close up against each other.
Two species of Regulus inhabit Europe, and one sub-species is found
in Corsica. The first is the Golden-crested Wren (Regulus cristatus),

surmounted by a crest of bright orange-yellow, framed with black
feathers. The female has a light yellow crest and less bright colours.

is approximately of the same size and colours as the preceding bird,
but is distinguished from it by its black rudimentary nasal feathers
and two white streaks, the one above the other, below the eye and
separated by a black line. It is much more delicate in captivity than
the Golden-crested Wren.
The American Wren (R. satrapa) resembles the preceding bird,
but its crest is of a brighter red ; it inhabits North America.
The Ruby-crowned Wren of Pennsylvania ( R . calendula) is
distinguished from the foregoing birds by its red crest not surrounded
by black. It is found in America, from Greenland to Guatemala.
All these species have been kept in cages in Europe.

SCENES IN THE LIVES OF TWO EAGLES

By Frederick D. Welch, M.R.C.S.
A large collection of Indian birds was brought to London in 1920,
and among them were two Eagles which were finally labelled Fishing
Eagle (Halicetus leucoryphus).
One scene in their lives has been already mentioned by me in the
Avicultural Magazine for 1921, pp. 111-12, when they showed
some hostility to each other one day during August, 1920, both Eagles
facing each other, the feathers on throat and neck raised in excitement,
eyes glittering, and wings partly raised ready for flight in attack.
Some people think that birds of prey are not interesting to observe ;
but, for my part, the cages containing them have had a special attraction
for me for some years--more so than those where Finches and such
birds are--and therefore some observations made since the afore-
mentioned scene may be worth adding to the above.
As previously stated in the Avicultural Magazine, 1921, p. 112,
these two Eagles seem to me to be male and female.
One sunny morning in July, 1921, the bird which looks smaller
settled after a flight in a posture which was an interesting one to see,
because no Eagle either of this genus or any other one seen alive by me
has clung in such a position.
Both Eagles had been very active in flight about their cage for

several minutes when the smaller bird, seated on the floor, flew upwards
and flapped about the cage for several seconds, and then caught hold
of the network forming the roof part of its cage with the claws of
both its feet.
There it held on for about forty seconds, its legs separated some-
what from one another more than when sitting in normal upright
position, its head and body hanging, therefore, upside down !
Seeing it in this unusual clinging position recalled to mind at once
the peculiar position which is usually and normally chosen by the small
Hanging Parrots of the genus Loriculus, which curious creatures
sleep--as members who observe Parrots are aware--hanging by their
feet head downwards from a bough.
The Fishing Eagle differed, however, from such Parrots seen by me
in earlier years in that, during the time it clung upside down, it was
frequently moving its head and neck about and looking around
the cage beneath it, evidently on the look out for another position
to fly to.
After a little while, it suddenly let go its hold and dropped,
turning in flight into an upright position during its aerial course, and
settled on the floor.
The scene showed that Eagles of this species can hang without
difficulty with their toes ; for instance, they may cling to another Eagle
with which they may be fighting in aerial combat when in a wild state.
To pass on to the next scene of interest witnessed between the two
Halicetus leucoryphus in the Zoological Gardens; this occurred in August,
1922. The summer of that year was, on the whole, a cold and wet
one ; but one afternoon in the month above mentioned, the sun came
out shining, and it was a nice warm afternoon--a pleasing contrast
to previous days.
The two Eagles spent the hours I watched them in very different
ways--the one flying about the large cage exercising itself, the other
sitting quite still at one end of the perch in an attitude which showed
it to be almost, if not quite, asleep.
After one flight, the smaller Eagle flew towards the motionless
one, and settled very suddenly on the perch close up against it, so
that it half-collided with its sleepy companion, shaking the latter

and making its foothold on the perch unsteady owing to the force
of the collision !
This, of course, immediately made the larger Eagle awake and
the method by which it restored its balance and regained a sure
foothold with its toes on the perch was interesting to see.
Personally I expected to see it expand its wings and flap them
while endeavouring to prevent its grasp of the perch being loosened
any more. But this it did not do, keeping its wings just as when in
the sleepy state previously. The tail was expanded very widely--
what looked to me to be the fullest expanse possible in a live bird--and
with a few rapid movements of these feathers in various ways (too
complicated to describe on paper), the Eagle completely restored its
balance after wavering unsteadily on the perch for about four seconds.
Having witnessed the angry scene in August, 1920, referred to
in the opening sentences of this account of their doings, I expected
the Eagle which had been awakened by such an unpleasant shaking
would get angry and attack its companion who flew up against it; but
here again matters went differently to what was expected, because
the larger Eagle, after gazing at its companion for about a minute,
settled down again in its sleepy attitude, just as it had been before
being flown into !
The action above referred to seemed to me to demonstrate that the
tail feathers in these Eagles are certainly of as great importance as the
wings are in balancing during sudden turns or movements during flight
;--possibly even more important judging from the fact that the tail
alone was used by this Fishing Eagle to restore its balance. In this
connexion it seems to me that Eagles which hunt fish (as these H.
leucoryphus do) have to move at times very suddenly when making a
dash at them, because some fish only show to the view of the Eagle on
certain occasions for a very few seconds indeed before disappearing too
deep below the surface of the water for an Eagle to reach them; there-
fore, a Sea Eagle hunting over sea, lake, or river, has occasionally to
change its course of flight at very very short notice if it is going to be
successful in catching that particular fish. On the other hand, mammals
which are preyed upon by true Eagles are exposed to the bird's view&apos;
for longer periods than fish--for instance, hares chased by Golden

Frederick I). Welch--Scenes in the Lives of Two Eagles 73
Eagles and small antelopes by the Eagles of Spizcetus genus in Africa--
and so it seems reasonable to think that sudden movements and sudden
dashes at prey are more often made by Sea Eagles than by the genera
Aquila (true Eagles) and Spizcetus (Hawk-eagles), and the tail to them
therefore is very useful indeed. When considering dashes at fish as just
mentioned above, it is interesting to notice how wonderfully well
the legs of Fishing Eagles are adapted for such purposes by having
the metatarsus above the toes bare of feathers !
After an Eagle has dashed its limbs into sea, lake, or river, and
grabbed a fish in its toes, the water easily runs off when the Eagle
rises again in flight towards land to eat its prey, and is no hindrance
to rapid rising into air. Legs which were heavily feathered, as in true
Eagles, and to lesser extent in Hawk-eagles, would retain the wet
longer, and therefore be less suitable for the birds' method of getting
its usual prey. The above mentioned is the case not only with the
species here considered, but applies of course to others in the genus
Halicetus.
As regards voice, both the Halicetus leucoryphus in the Gardens
are very noisy birds ; and their voices are similar which, if the diagnosis
that they are male and female be correct, shows that wild birds cannot
be distinguished, male from female, by voice alone.
The sound which is uttered most commonly is a rather quiet one
for an Eagle, and is like " cack, cack, cack," etc., during which the
mandibles are held wide open and there is some bulging of the skin
at the extreme upper part of the throat as long as it is continued,
wdiich is sometimes for several minutes without any stop.
Another sound is like " hock, hock, hock ! " uttered in bass voice;
but this is very much louder than the other--more like a bass screech.
There are also other sounds louder than the one first mentioned,
but so like each other when heard by human ear that I cannot describe
them in words approaching accuracy. It may not be out of place
to compare the voices of these birds with the Sea Eagle from Corea
(Halicetus branickii), mentioned by me in the Avicultural Magazine,
1920, p. 55, because the latter species is not often, according to my
experience, brought alive to Britain.
On many occasions I have watched this magnificent bird, and

while, on the one hand, it was a quieter bird than the H. leucoryphus
because these 1 call oftener and keep it up for a longer period, the
H. branicJcii had, on the other hand, a voice which was very much
louder when it did use it, and could be heard a much further
distance away. The screech was twice as loud, if not more so, than
that of leucoryphus. Its squeal was also louder than that of these
Indian birds; and, it may, perhaps, be added with advantage,
than that of any White-headed or White-tailed Sea Eagles yet seen
alive by me.
In 1920-1 the H. leucoryphus were brown in plumage and iris,
beak blackish, legs yellowish ; but during the latter half of 1922
the tails became lightish grey with broad black tips. When the
wings are folded, most of the grey is covered, but about one inch can
be seen when viewed from behind.

The Wood Wren (Phylloscopus sibilatrix)
This bird is a lover of oak and beech woods, and I don't remember
ever finding it elsewhere.
A pair will select some corner of a beech wood for its breeding
haunt, as often as not near a footpath or old cart-road or timber track.
They are far less numerous than either the Willow Wren or Chiff
Chaff, and it is seldom that one finds more than a couple of pairs in
one wood. I have never found them even in an underwood, but always
in beech and oak woods.
The nest is built right on the ground, sometimes under a small
piece of bramble, at other times on the bare leaves that have fallen
the previous autumn without any grass or brambles to hide it: even
then it is difficult to find, you may stand over the nest and notice only
a small portion of leaves and dead grass raised up, as if a mole in working
underground had hunched its back up and had thrust up a portion
of the dead leaves in doing so. This is the nest, for if you turn your

head sideways you will at once see the entrance to the nest, which is
on the side, for it is of the domed type.
The inside is always lined with dry grass as fine as horsehair, no
feathers being used.
When near the nest the birds fly round, sometimes within a few
feet of you, uttering their call note which is a rather drawn-out,
mournful " Tweet, tweet! " uttered at short intervals ; the bird is very
bold during the nesting season, and will come quite close to you.
In the end of April or first week in May the bird arrives, and it is
rather difficult to catch sight of it until it moves, although it may be
but a short distance from you ; this is on account of the leaf and bird
being so much alike in colour. I call the Wood Warbler a most
beautifully coloured bird. I have heard people say they have been
unable to tell the Willow Wren and Wood Wren apart in the wild state :
all I can say is, the Willow Wren and Chiff Chaff are not to be compared
with the former species for colour. The Wood Wren is a beautiful
beech-leaf green all over, the upper parts with a bright sulphur yellow
supercilliary streak over the&apos;eye much broader than in the Willow
Wren. The chin and throat also sulphur yellow, its breast and under
parts, including under tail-coverts, almost pure white, the wings are
dark, edged with bright yellowish green, as also is the tail. The wings
are very long, reaching when closed to within about a quarter of an
inch of the end of the tail.
In the spring, when they have been here a few days and before the
hens arrive, I have fetched the bird down within a few feet of me by
imitating the call note " Tweet, tweet", the bird appearing annoyed
at not finding the other (human) bird uttering the " Tweet, tweet ".
They have a peculiar habit in the early part of the spring in regard
to flight; instead of flying in an undulating manner from one tree to
another, they will fly very slowly in a slightly zigzag way, very much
like a bat uses its wings.
When singing they raise their head slightly backwards and produce
their shivering song of zit, zit, zit, slowly at first, then quicker until
the end of the song is extremely rapid, the whole body seems to shiver
or shake in the effort to produce the notes.
It is wonderful how these birds live through a long spell of drought;

76 Hoiv to Keep Insectivorous Birds in Perfect Condition
no matter how dry the season I have always been able to find any
particular pair of Wood Wrens at all times, and I have known all the
ponds dried up and no water anywhere within reach of the birds ;
whether they find the morning dew (when there is any) sufficient,
I do not know. This has often struck me in regard to other species
that inhabit woods only, and never appear to leave them : one can
understand birds like Woodpeckers and Starlings that use holes in the
trees in woods for nesting, and then fly distances away, they do
have a chance of finding moisture; but, with other species who do not
move away, it is wonderful to me how they survive a long spell of
drought.
The young are almost as bright in colour in the nest as the adults:
it is a picture to see perhaps half-a-dozen bright coloured little Wood
Wrens with heads all pointing towards the entrance of the nest.
The adult birds will rear their own young in captivity, feeding them
within half an hour of being put into the cage, and so will many other
insectivorous birds, provided the food at first given is that which
they have been feeding them on in the wild state, afterwards sub-
stituting cut-up mealworms and fresh live ant cocoons. They will
rear their young perfectly and become themselves very tame in an
extraordinary short space of time. The cage used being roomy, with
a few green boughs put in and green moss all over the drawer board,
they will keep the nest perfectly clean and behave exactly as if outside.
The food of this species when kept should be exactly the same
as that provided for the other previously mentioned species, with the
exception of fruit and berries, which they do not partake of.
The cage should be like that used for the Blackcap, but can be
slightly smaller.
There is nothing to recommend this species as a cage-bird, except
its beautiful and delicate coloured plumage, the song not being of
high order.
One curious thing about this bird is that it can be heard and seen
any time whilst it is rearing its young, but as soon as the young are
large enough to look after themselves not a sign of the adult or young
nor a sound of them can be heard in any woods or any of the surrounding
country. They appear to clear right away, and are not seen again

By J. Delacour
It seems a curious fact that although Great Britain has always
been the leading country for most forms of aviculture, yet rare Pheasant
breeding has never been very successfully carried out on the northern
side of the Channel, while it has been most flourishing in France for
nearly a century.
This is even true now. There are no big collections of Pheasants
in England at present, while in France and in Italy a few very important
collections and many lesser ones exist. Moreover, there are also
numerous persons of small means who breed fancy Pheasants for
profit and do well on it: clergymen, schoolmasters, and small
officials have always been very successful at it.
I have always had a great fondness for Pheasants ; they are
such gorgeous birds ! If the wild and timid temperament of many
is a real drawback, yet the interest of breeding young ones makes
up for it easily.
Since 1905 (and I was quite young then) I have kept a large number
of Pheasants. Up to 1918 my pheasantry in Picardy was flourishing,
and its destruction was not only a terrible blow to me, but also to
aviculture in general, as with it disappeared some of the last specimens
in Europe of such rare birds as the Mikado, Scemerring's, Vieillot's,
and Wallich's Pheasants, which have never been bred since.
As soon as the war was over I set to work again, and succeeded
in gathering a nice lot of birds.
Perhaps a few lines on the accommodation that I have here might
be useful to some members.
For newly imported or sickly birds I have a few indoor heated
aviaries, which are necessary but seldom used for any length of time.
Further, I dispose of a dozen roomy flights (from 50 to 150 square

feet) with heated shelters for delicate species such as Argus or especially
valuable birds in their first winter. I find that almost all the Pheasants
can stand their second winter in a cold shelter and often even out of
doors, but they need care the first one. The majority of my other
pens are scattered in groups of 6 to 10 in different spots in the park ;
they all have grass, plenty of bushes, and a small wooden house, the
whole thing as natural as possible. Each pen is separated from the next
one by concrete slabs (" fibro-cement ") 2 ft. high, so that the birds
cannot fight or be disturbed. These pens are as large as possible,
from 150 to 400 square feet. All Pheasants' pens must be wired over ;
other fences are never safe, even with pinioned birds ; I must confess
that I still have some uncovered pens, but I only keep in them
common species.
Feeding is of great importance : fertility depends a great deal
upon it; in the spring, heating food is necessary, and fattening stuff
such as maize must be given with great precaution.
To avoid failures it is necessary to know that while you can (and
it is better) put several hens to one cock in some genera, you would
undoubtedly never get a fertile egg if you did so with others. The
following groups of Pheasants are polygamous in captivity : Jungle-
fowls (Gallus), True Pheasants ( Phasianus ), Long-tailed Pheasants
( Lyrmaticus ), Reeves', Elliott's, Soemerring's, Mikado, Golden, and
Amherst Pheasants. Those which must have only one hen are:
Tragopans, Monauls, Polyplectrons, Crossoptilons, Firebacks, and
Kaleeges ; this includes Silver and Swinhoe's Pheasants, in fact, all
Crested Pheasants except Golden and Amherst's.
Eggs should be collected daily and put under Bantam hens within
a week.
The chicks are first kept in coops and runs and soon allowed liberty
(while the foster-mother remains a prisoner) in a field well away from
where old Pheasants or poultry are kept.
When three months old, young Pheasants must be caught up and
put into aviaries.
Rare species, to avoid any accidents, we rear in a field covered
in with wire. Of course, the coops should be rat-proof and the birds
shut in carefully at night.

Food for young Pheasants is not always easy to provide, and varies
according to species, locality, weather, etc., but the fare should
always include ant cocoons and custard.
Just now my collection is fairly good, and I have great hopes for
the coming season. I have several pairs of the following species :
Red, Java and Sonnerat's Junglefowls, Chinque's and Germain's Poly-
plectrons, Mountclussion Crossoptilons (or Ho-Kis), Monauls,
Temminck's, Cabot's and Satyr Tragopans, Golden, Amherst's,
Reeves', Elliott's ; Silver, Lineated, Black-crested Kaleege ; Horsfield's
and Swinhoe's Pheasants ; Siamese, Bornean, and Crestless Firebacks ;
but my best birds are two pairs of Argus, two pairs of the rare Bel's
Pheasants from Annam, and three pairs of Edwards' Pheasants, a
bird which was only known by four skins before I went to Annam
this year. The pearl is the unique pair of the Imperial Pheasant,
a fine all-blue bird, which I have just discovered in North Annam.

In the year 1813 a Russian ship's captain named von Krusenstein
visited the Marquesa Islands, and on his return to St. Petersburg
the following year produced a somewhat crude drawing of a small
Ground Dove which he had obtained in the mountains of the island
of Nukuhiva, one of the Marquesas.
In 1918 the naturalist Vieillot described this bird from the illustra-
tion, and named it Columba ruhescens. His description in French
is printed as a small-print note in the B.M. Catalogue, vol. xxi, p. 606,
where it is placed in the genus Phlogcenas.
Nothing further was heard of this species for more than a hundred
years.
In 1920, through the generosity of Mr. Harry Payne Whitney,
an expedition was organized by the American Museum of Natural
History to conduct ornithological field work in eastern Polynesia,
under the leadership of Mr. Rollo H. Beck, and amongst other birds
collected in the Marquesas was this lost Dove, as was discovered

A Small Aviary and some Gadgets
when the collection was worked out in New York by Dr. Robert C.
Murphy, of the American Museum of Natural History. A good series
of skins was obtained, not from Nukuhiva, from which it appears to
have vanished, but from the islands of Fatuhuku and Hatutu.
In addition to the dead specimens, some living birds were brought
home for Mr. E. W. Gifford, of Oakland, California, in whose aviaries
they very soon bred. Some of the young were apparently sent to the
Bronx Park, and the Zoological Society of New York, with their usual
generosity, have presented a specimen to the Zoological Society of
London, and this is apparently the only example, alive or dead, in
existence outside the U.S.A. and the Marquesa Islands.
It is a rather small Dove with somewhat long legs and may be
described as follows : Head, neck and breast grey ; the remainder
of the under surface, as well as most of the upper surface, fuscous-
black ; the feathers of the upper back scapulars and lesser wing-
coverts broadly margined with iridescent violet-purple ; middle
back glossed with dark green. The quills and tail-feathers have
the proximal half white, the terminal half black, the white being
a very conspicuous feature during flight, though invisible at other times.
Legs and feet are reddish-black.

A SMALL AVIARY AND SOME GADGETS
Having moved, it was of course necessary to build an aviary for
my small stock of common foreign birds.
The only site available unfortunately faced north, and was on
a slope. To make the best of this required thinking matters out
for a time, as I wanted to visualize the complete erection before starting
to build.
Finally, a stout, open-fronted shed with span roof was bought in
sections and erected on dry bricks. A low wall of breeze slabs coated
with cement was laid in a concrete-filled trench all round inside the
shed and across the open front and this was filled with coarse gravel
rammed hard and covered with 6 inches of builders' sand. This
provided a dry shelter, and any incursions of rats from below would

be at once apparent in the loose sand. One part of the shed was
boarded in, except for a narrow doorway at the back, so that a cosy
draught-proof place was available for severe weather. A window
was placed in this for light, but was not of clear glass but translucent
only. For the open flight the space remaining was sloping and
the shape of a right-angled triangle, based on the open front of
the shed.
Obviously the water pool and the door must be at or near the
apex of the triangle, so a hole was dug about 2 feet square and the
same deep, and filled up nearly to the ground-level with broken pots,
slates, china, etc., with a 2-inch pipe set in the middle. A layer
of rough concrete round the pipe, followed by cement, made a pool
with the outlet pipe level with the bottom and the depth varying
from nothing to 4 inches over the pipe. A rubber bath-plug screwed
on a stick and the thing was done, and the pool could be emptied,
scrubbed clean, and refilled in no time. In the last layer of cement
small round pebbles were set to give a better and more natural
appearance. To catch early and late sunshine over high hedges it
was necessary to have the roof of the flight at the apex of the triangle
as high as possible, so the door was put here also. A low door with
a high peak of flight over it at the narrow end of the flight was thought
the best scheme for avoiding escapes when entering, as any birds near
the door would fly up and back to the wide end of the flight. This
has proved perfectly successful. To make it clear please get a scrap
of paper and draw a rectangle, lettering it ABCD. The back being
A-B and the open front C-D.
On C-D (remember your Euclid) make a right-angled triangle,
CDE. CE being a continuation of AC, cut off the point at E leaving
a narrow end only, and parallel to CD. That gives you the ground
plan, and saves our magazine from the cost and space of an illustration.
I have not put in the enclosed part of the shed ABCD, mentioned
earlier. The narrow end at E is the door and the flight runs up to
a high peak at E over it. To get over the difficulty of the slope down
from the shed, rough bricks and bits of breeze block were used to terrace
up the slope into three broad, shallow steps, part of which was used
for planting a small tree or two, part for a narrow path, and part

A Small Aviary and some Gadgets
covered with sand, or a patch of grass and weeds if room enough.
The lower part of the sides of the flight was constructed of rough
walling made with breeze blocks (cement washed) and rough stones
set in cement mortar, all being on a trench filled with concrete to keep
rats from burrowing under. The rest of the sides and the top was
of the usual wire netting and stout creosoted batten construction.
One valuable tip for this or chicken-run construction : have the hinge-
side post of your door of heavy square hardwood set in cement, or better,
in concrete. It saves your structure from straining when the door
is opened. In fact, I had both the door posts of this sort, and con-
sequently the whole structure is rigid. Paint your wire-netting well.
Being on a slope the question of drainage solved itself except for the
final exit of water under the door. I made the inner doorstep with
a bottom layer of concrete, then a layer of broken glass, pots, odd
clean stones, etc., and then by covering this with a piece of sacking
I finished off my " sandwich " with a layer of fine concrete. The water
therefore drains through the middle layer of the sandwich, which
is of course perfectly rat-proof, and out under the door, but there is
nothing visible of this middle layer except at the end where it is exposed
under the door. I hope this is clear.
Perches and nest-boxes w r ere fitted as convenient, taking care
that the full length of the flight was kept as free as possible. A shelf
in the high peak over the door at E is much appreciated. Seed hoppers
were hung in the shed clear of the sides and by a single wire, as it is
almost out of the question to keep out small mice, although half inch
wire seems too small for full-grown ones to pass. The shed was largely
lined with brushwood, tacked on, and the inside coated with light
green washable distemper. Branches were also fixed in the apex
of the span roof for roosting purposes.
That is my little aviary, and it is a success. The birds get all the
sun there is, and the flight being 9 feet high at the apex or door end
and 6 feet high at the shed end, they have plenty of room. It was
made in three months, in spare time only, and working single-handed.
Note, it is advisable when using breeze slabs for outdoor or exposed
work, to coat them with a thickness of cement wash, otherwise they
will absorb water, and when a frost comes they will split and crumble.

Also they look better, and if the cement is put on thickly in lumps,
so much the better for appearance and for utility.
If possible get that creosoted battening which is sold for edging
garden beds as it is creosoted to the heart under pressure instead of
being just painted over with preservative. It will last a lifetime
off the ground.
If really troubled by rats half-inch wire netting laid all over the
ground space and covered with 6 inches of sand or dry ashes will be
useful, provided the edges are made safe with concrete.

Sir, --In the special article on the Flycatchers by J. Delacour,
that writer refers to the Red-headed Robin (Miro australis) as
occasionally seen in European collections. Several years ago, some-
where about the period 1902 to 1905, there were in the Western Aviary
of the London Gardens two charming-looking birds labelled White-
bellied Robins, (Miro albifrons). So far as I now remember they came
from South Island, New Zealand, and were in general colour a slaty-
grey with white breast, belly, and vent, and were rather large in size.
Whether the species is commonly imported I cannot say ; but as
they were nice birds and had the same generic name as the Red-headed
Robin, and presumably closely allied to it, I thought it might be of
interest to mention them. They had a twittering song, so far as I now
remember.

of flight from the start. Both old birds fed them for another month,
when quite unexpectedly the male parent attacked them, tearing
one of them literally to pieces. The other I rescued, only slightly
injured, and placed in a separate aviary. It fed itself without difficulty
on hard seed, and is now in perfect condition in every respect. The
behaviour on the part of the father may, I think, be attributed to his
desire to nest again and his consequent jealousy of the young birds.
The young bird had a horn-coloured beak until Christmas, when it
rapidly assumed a black tint.
My Cockatoos nested in a suspended tool-chest in an open-air
aviary 35 by 16 feet, and 16 feet high, part of which is covered
over. In the same aviary are some Doves, a Rosella, a Ring-neck,
Cowbirds, Glossy Starlings, and several smaller birds. For some
time I have been trying to cross Leadbeater's Cockatoo with the
Roseate, but so far without success.

CHEESE AS FOOD FOR BIRDS
Sir, --I find my Glossy Starlings prefer cheese to any other food,
except of course mealworms. My Budgerigars were very fond of it
also when they were breeding, but I don't think they eat it much
now that I don't keep hens. Wild Robins, Accentors, and Sparrows
also are very fond of it. It seems to suit them all very well, yet I have
never seen it mentioned in any book, so it may interest your readers.

follows :--
626. Pin-tailed Sand Grouse, Pterocles alchatus (L.)
With Meade-Waldo this species " bred regularly from 1896 to
1914. From several pairs over sixty young were reared. They were
bred from both the Eastern and Western 1 races . . . Exustus never
eats green food, which is relished by the other species ; and won't
sit on grass, which is preferred by the others ; it is also much more
lethargic. The young of all species are very independent ". Meade-
Waldo in litt., Sept. 6th, 1924. See also A.M. 1906, 219 ; 1910, 133.
One of his hens lived 17 years in captivity. They were also bred
by St. Quintin; see A.M. 1905, 64.
627. Lesser Pin-tailed Sand Grouse, P. exustus (Temm.)
First breeder, St. Quintin in 1904, two young birds being reared.

THE timeliidt:
By J. Delacour
In Oceania, in Africa, and especially in Asia, a large number of
insectivorous and frugivorous birds are found which approach pretty
closely to the Thrushes and Warblers ; they are distinguished from
these, however, by short and rounded wings, and frequently by a longer
tail, thicker beak, and stouter legs ; their movements are rapid, and
they move from place to place by large hops.
These birds are exceedingly numerous ; their size varies from that
of a Warbler to that of a Jay, and one group differs considerably from
another in appearance. Their classification is still doubtful.
These birds are known as the Timeliidse, the most familiar type
of which is Liothrix, or the Pekin Robin.
On account of their number and of their extreme diversity, we will
divide them into five groups, which we will study separately. To
begin with, we may state that all the Timeliidse are excellent cage and
aviary birds, lively and intelligent ; many have a fine plumage and
some a very agreeable song. They are generally easy to feed, and
content themselves with the ordinary diet of insectivorous mixture
and fruit, with a few insects. The large species must be treated like
Thrushes, the small ones like Warblers.
I. The Jay-Thrushes ( Crateropodince)
The Jay-thrushes, which are large Timeliidse, live in flocks;
they are very noisy and full of curiosity. Their eggs, with very few
exceptions, are blue or white without spots ; they are laid in nests in

the form of cups. They mostly feed on the ground, like thrushes, whose
habits and diet they follow rather closely, although their shape and
appearance remind one rather of those of the Jay. The males and
females are alike. Their feet are very strong, and their heads more
or less crested. Their voice is penetrating and singular, and they
sometimes all start calling suddenly together, spreading out their
crests, tails, and wings.
They are generally common in wooded regions. Certain species
frequent gardens. I have frequently observed and captured them in
India and Indo-China.
These birds are admirably suited for the aviary, where their activity
and sudden movements make them very amusing. They are too
large and too active for cages. They sometimes nest in captivity, but
rarely rear their broods ; most frequently the young are killed by
the parents before leaving the nest.
Two Australian Jay-Thrushes which are very peculiar have
appeared in European aviaries.
The Spotted Jay-Thrush (Cinclosoma punctatum) lives in the
south-east of Australia. It is a bird which inhabits rocky gorges full
of undergrowth, and it lives and nests on the ground ; its flight is
heavy. The male is brown on the back, each feather having a dark line
in the middle ; the wing coverts are bronzed black with white tips ;
the middle tail-feathers are green, the others black with white
ends ; head brown on the top, passing into grey on the forehead ;
eyebrows white as well as a large spot on the sides of the neck ; parotic
regions brown ; round the eye, chin and neck, black ; breast grey,
bordered below with a black line; under part of body white
in front, spotted with yellowish brown and black beneath. The female
has no black on her head, on the throat, nor on the breast, nor any white
on the neck ; the wings and tail are greyer.
The Coach Whip Bird (Psophodes crepitans) is a very fine bird
which is found in the east of Australia. The top of the body, the
wings, the tail, and the sides are of a bronzed olive green ; the head,
provided with a big crest, is black as well as the breast; a large white
mark starts from the base of the beak and runs along the sides of the
neck ; the abdomen and chin are white, spotted with grey. The female

<bodyText confidence="0.998977611111111" page_id="56188533"  page_num="89" year="" vol="">
is similar to the male. This bird inhabits forests and lives among the
bushes and the creepers ; it feeds on insects which it catches on the
ground. It is shy and very lively in its movements. The song
of these birds is strange, and ends by a snapping sound like the
cracking of a whip preceded by two gentle whistles ; the female takes
part in this.
The Dryonastes are distinguished by their nostrils being covered
and by the stiff feathers at the base of the beak; they greatly resemble
the Jays.
The Chinese Jay-Thrush (D. chinensis) is olive brown shaded with
ashy grey, with a black head ; the cheeks are white. It is seen from
time to time in aviaries. It is a very beautiful bird, a favourite
with the Annamites, who frequently keep it in a cage.
I have just brought back from Annam some D. lugens, which differ
from the preceding bird in having grey cheeks.
Three other species have also been imported : D. ruficollis from the
Himalayas, olive brown with slaty grey head marked with white, the
front of the neck, area round the beak and the throat, black; the sides of
the neck of rosy red ; D. perspicillatus, of Southern China, Indo-China,
and Siam, brown with the head varying between grey and blackish ; it
is very common in Annam in the bamboo hedges which surround the
villages ; I have just brought back some specimens ; D. coerulatus,
from the East Himalayas, reddish brown, black round the eyes and
the beak as well as the chin and under the body, white.
The Garrulax are the most frequently imported members of the
group. They only differ from the preceding species in the fact that
their nostrils are less covered by the feathers of the forehead. They
are in general larger and provided with well-developed crests.
The White-crested Jay-Thrush (G. leucolophus) is a superb bird, of
the size of a Jay, brilliant olive brown, with the head, neck, and well-
developed crest pure white ; a large black line passes over the eye.
It inhabits the Himalayas and is replaced in Burma and in Indo-
China by closely allied species (G. diardi). Its note is amusing and
agreeable, resembling a peal of laughter.
It is fairly frequently imported, and is an excellent aviary bird,
being very hardy.

The White-throated Jay-Thrush (G. albigularis) , of the Himalayas
and of China, is brown, with a pure white throat, and black round the
eyes ; it reaches us from time to time.
The Black-gorgeted Jay-Thrush ( G . pectoralis) is olive brown shaded
with fawn, the end of the tail being white, a black line passing by the
eye, and a wide black bar on the breast. It inhabits the Himalayas
and Burma.
The Collared Jay-Thrush (G. picticollis) is tawny brown ; back of
the head is dark brown, separated from the back by a band of orange
red ; thin white eyebrows surrounded with black, face and neck
yellowish white, surrounded by a black line ; sides of the neck greyish-
blue. This Garrulax is higher on its legs and has a finer beak than the
preceding ones; it resembles in appearance the large Nightingale
of Japan.
The Ianthocincla only differ from the Garrulax by the absence of
the stiff feathers at the base of the beak ; their nostrils are covered by
a few long hairs ; their secondary wing feathers end in white tips.
The Grey-headed Jay-Thrush (I. cinereiceps) of China is of a light
olive brown, the eyebrows as well as round the eyes being of a whitish
colour ; the top of the head ashy grey, as well as a line passing over the
eye ; the cheeks orange coloured and a dark brown line passing from
the beak above the cheek; the primary wing feathers and the
secondaries are olive green with a black spot terminated by a white
tip ; the tail is similar.
The Trochalopterum have no hairs on the nostrils ; generally their
wings are provided with a mirror of bright colour. Their size varies
greatly, and the smaller species resemble the Timeliidse.
The Bed-headed Jay-Thrush (T. erythrocephalum) is olive brown
above, tawny below, with a russet head; the parotic regions, the breast,
and the top of the back are spotted with black ; tail grey, tinged with
yellow ; wings variegated bluish grey and yellow. Its habitat is the
Himalayas. &apos; From the same region some other species have been
imported, which are mentioned below.
T. nigrimentum is variegated russet and brown ; it is distinguished
by the feathers of the cheeks and throat, which are black, bordered
with russet, T. lineatum, which is very common in its native country,

has the head, the nape of the neck, and the back striated ashy
grey ; the lower part of the back and the wing coverts are reddish
brown variegated with white ; the russet tail has a subterminal
black band and ends in grey ; round the eyes it is white and grey ; the
cheeks and the eyebrows are chestnut; the chin, the throat, and the
chest are maroon spotted with grey ; the under part of the body is
greyish brown.
T. rufigulare is of a general olive brown colour or russet spotted with
black; the head is curiously marked with grey, russet, white, and black.

form closely resembles the very large Nightingale of Japan. It was
frequently imported some years ago under the name of Pekin Nightin-
gale ; it reaches us more rarely nowadays. This is the favourite cage
bird of the Chinese, who esteem it for its sonorous and varied song and
for its pugnacious disposition, which enables it to be employed as a
fighting bird. It is of a chestnut brown, lighter below and on the rump,
and lightly striped with black on the back ; the eye is surrounded with
white, which extends to the eyebrows.
The Striated Jay-Thrush ( Grammatophila striata) is recognized
by its short and thick beak, and by its greyish-brown plumage striped
all over with white ; the wings and the tail are maroon. It inhabits
the Himalayas.
The Argya differ from the previous genera by their partly feathered
nostrils and by their longer and very tapered tail. They are found in
the plains of India, of Asia Minor, and of Africa. They have the same
habits as the other Jay-Thrushes. Their colours are generally very
dull; grey and brown of various shades striped with black dominate
therein. They are in short very moderately attractive aviary birds,
and we shall content ourselves with enumerating the few species which
are sometimes imported : A. malcolmi and A. caudata from India ;
A. squamiceps from Arabia ; A. acacice from Abyssinia. It is possible,
indeed, that some other species very common in Africa or in India
may have been introduced.
The Crater opus are only distinguished from the Argya by their
larger size, their shorter tail, which is much less tapered, and their
thicker beak. They are found both in Africa and in India.

Aviculture
The Grey Babbler or " Seven Sisters 55 (C. canorus) is imported
from time to time. It is a bird of a dull and rather pale brownish-grey,
which is only remarkable for its yellowish-white eyes, and its amusing
attitudes. In 1908 a couple were brought from Bombay by the late
Mr. Boullet; he kept them for several years in his aviary at Corbie,
where they nested two or three times each summer in the ivy, but they
never brought up any young. He gave me these birds in 1912 ; when
kept by themselves in an aviary they continued to nest, but destroyed
their young at the end of a week. None were ever reared.
Two South African species have also been imported : C. jardinei,
of a brownish-grey, striped with dark brown and white, and the C . bicolor ,
a beautiful white bird with the tail and wing feathers of a dark brown.
During the last few years one could see a very remarkable bird in the
Zoological Gardens, in London. It was the Pterorhinus davidi of North
China. Its dress is, however, very modest : earthy brown, lighter
below, with bluish-grey wing feathers ; its beak is fairly long and
curved, of yellow colour, half covered by long pile-like feathers growing
from the base. But the plumage of this bird is delightfully light and
soft, and its attitude most graceful. The specimen in the Zoological
Gardens in London was very tame ; it lived nearly three years.
It is the only one, I believe, which has been seen in Europe.
The birds of which we have just been speaking have a peculiar
beak; the Scimitar Babbler (Pomatorhinus) has its beak longer still,
thinner, and more curved ; the tail is tapered, and the feathers of the
crown are lengthened and can be erected when the bird is excited.
These birds nest close to the ground and lay white eggs without
any spots. Their nest is pretty. They form a numerous and well-
defined genus ; they are found in India, China, in the Sunda Islands,
in Indo-China, and as far as New Guinea and Australia.
Up to the present only Indian species have been imported.
It is the Bust-cheeked Scimitar Babbler (P. erythrogenys) which
is most frequently seen in Europe. It is olive brown on the back; russet
moustache near the beak, then black ; forehead, parotic regions, sides
of the neck, legs and lower covering of the tail brown ; sides of the
breast and of the body chestnut, with stripes of olive green ; chin,
throat, centre of breast, and abdomen white.

It is an excellent aviary bird, with a strange appearance ; there
is nothing more curious than to see it striking the ground to the right
and to the left with its great beak in order to seek its food there.
P. macclellandi only differs from the preceding by its breast spotted
with black.
P. schisticeps has the top of the head of a slaty-grey ; the upper
part of the body is olive russet brown ; white eyebrows, lores and
parotic regions black ; under part of the body white with a great
brown spot on the sides of the neck, of the breast, and of the abdomen.
P. olivaceus scarcely differs from the preceding except by the absence
of the brown on the sides of the breast and of the abdomen. I found it
in Annam in the tall grass.
II. The Lesser Babblers (Timeliince)
The Timeliince are Jay-Thrushes in miniature ; a strong beak,
short wings, and large feet are typical of the group. They live, however,
a rather solitary life close to the ground, and are not very noisy ; their
eggs are spotted, except in the case of the Stachyris, and they have no
crest; males and females are alike. They are found in Asia, Africa, and
Oceania.
So far as I know, only six species have been imported and only the
Golden-eyed Babbler has been imported in any abundance.
In captivity these birds, when once acclimatized, are not delicate;
the food of the small insectivorse such as the Warblers, suits them very
well; they like a little chopped raw meat.
They generally become very tame, they are always very intelligent
and adopt charming attitudes ; they are, therefore, very desirable
both as cage and as aviary birds. They have not hitherto bred
in captivity, so far as I am aware.
The Bed-capped Babbler (Timelia pileata) is a charming little
bird, whose black, deep, and narrow beak gives it a peculiar
expression. It has a white forehead and eyebrows, black lores, a
dark russet crown ; the lower part of the body is white shaded with
grey, the beak olive green ; the tail is striped with brown in two
shades. It inhabits India, Indo-China, and Java.
I had one of these Babblers in a cage ; it was delightfully intelligent
and lively, but rather delicate.

P. F. M. Galloway --
The Golden-eyed Babbler (Pyctorhis sinensis) is of a russet brown
above, with the lores and the eyebrows white, as well as the chin,
the cheeks, the throat, and the breast; the abdomen and the sides are
a pale fawn. The particular feature of this bird is that it has eyelids
of a bright orange yellow and a pale yellow iris ; the beak is black.
It inhabits India and Indo-China.
These Babblers are excellent cage birds which one can put into an
aviary for the summer. Like the preceding species, they have charming
manners.
Four other Babblers have also been imported on rare occasions,
viz.: Stachyris leucotis of Malay and of Borneo, S. nigriceps from the
Himalayas ; Stachyridopsis ruficeps from the Himalayas and China,
and S. pyrrhops from the Himalayas.

The Grasshopper &amp;quot;Warbler (Locustella ncevia)
This bird I have found in my locality every spring. I know of
several favourite marshy places along the River Kennet in Berkshire,
where I can be fairly certain of seeing and hearing it at the right time
of the year, and also on three commons on the hills not far from the
town of Reading, for this bird chooses dry open commons where the
furze grows luxuriantly and where the grass, heather, and oak scrub
grows rank, just as often as the low-lying marshes.
It is not by any means a common species, at any rate I cannot call
to mind any one season that I have heard or seen more than half a dozen,
and if they were about I think I should know of them, for I am out
and about their favourite haunts a great deal.
Some years I have found only two pairs, others anything from two
to five pairs ; like other species they appear in some seasons to vary a
good deal in numbers. I do not, of course, know if this applies to
other parts, but I am speaking of my own neighbourhood.

How to Keep Insectivorous Birds in Perfect Condition 95
They arrive in their favourite haunt about 10th April, but in some
seasons I have not met with it until the 23rd of the month.
When they first arrive they sing their reeling notes at intervals
during the day, but after a short time hardly a sound is heard from them
until sunset, and they can be also heard at sunrise.
This species is rather skulking in its habits, slinking along the
ground slowly, threading its way through the grasses and undergrowth.
I have always been greatly interested in this little Warbler ; although
very sombre in colour it is very neat and graceful in appearance.
In colour it is olive greenish brown on the upper parts, each feather
being darker in the centre, giving it a slightly speckled appearance,
the dark centres of the feather graduating up to the forehead where they
are very tiny, but quite distinct. The breast is pale creamy buff, the
throat being a little lighter; on the latter is a little necklace of tiny
brown spots. The hen is like the cock but minus the spots: the under tail-
coverts unusually long, ashy buff with dark splashes of brown in the
centre, and reaching to within half an inch of the end of the tail, about
the longest under tail-coverts of any British Warbler ; the tail has the
outer feathers very short and gradually increasing to the centre feathers,
which are the longest, and when this bird spreads it like a fan, which it
often does, the tail looks very wide for such a small slender bird.
This species does not hop, but walks slowly and picks its feet up
like a proud little Game Bantam. This is the only bird I know that
can take a step or two backwards if anything should disturb it in front;
if one of these should be kept and the owner should put his hand towards
the front of the cage when the bird is approaching, instead of running
to the side it will take a step or two backwards just as easily and
gracefully as it does in moving forwards ; at times it can run along fairly
fast, as I have seen them do when driving the hens to nest.
I have read some works in which it has been stated that the Grass-
hopper Warbler is so shy that it is difficult to get even a glimpse of
the bird, and that it is so cautious that it will run out on to a twig,
deliver its song, and retire into the undergrowth at once.
In all my experience I have never seen it do so. I have been on a
common and with care have been able to approach within a few feet
of it, so near that I could see its tongue moving whilst reeling.

P. F. M. Galloway --
The great thing is to stand motionless ; if no movement is made
on the part of the observer, the Grasshopper Warbler will take no notice
of you, and when I say I have had them reeling and running almost
over my boots I can speak, I think, from experience. It happened in
this way.
One lovely evening during the middle of May, when the sun was
just sinking and the weather calm and warm, I went out on to a
common where I could hear a Grasshopper Warbler reeling loudly ;
after picking my feet up and placing them down very quietly, taking
care to avoid treading on any sticks, I came upon the spot where he
was; it happened that this particular piece of ground contained rather
low bushes, and where I stood the furze was scanty and very short.
The bird was within a few feet of me and where I stood was a rabbit
run, and my feet within an inch or two of it. I stood quite still, round
came the hen, running fast right in the rabbit run, the cock bird was
a foot behind her running with his tail spread out like a fan and his
wings raised up over his back, displaying to the hen and reeling as
hard as he could reel; round they went in a circle and past my feet again
within an inch of my boot; this they did several times before going off
in another direction, and I believe if I had put my foot into the middle
of the rabbit run they would have run over my boot.
The reeling song of the Grasshopper Warbler, resembling the noise
made by a grasshopper (insect), does not exactly convey the song. The
song more nearly resembles the noise made by a new free-wheel on a
bicycle, but this is too high pitched ; the nearest noise you can make
to the song of this bird is to get a check reel from a fishing tackle shop,
and choose one of good size that produces the sound as near as possible
in the right key.
If you know a locality where for certain there is a Grasshopper
Warbler, just turn this check reel fairly fast and quite evenly and the
bird will soon disclose his whereabouts.
I have had this bird come round me, and whilst I have been reeling
he has been reeling, both reeling together, the bird being very agitated
and popping in and out of the undergrowth close to me, no doubt
worrying himself at not being able to find out where the other Grass-
hopper Warbler was.

How to Keep Insectivorous Birds in Perfect Condition 97
The nest of this species I have found on two occasions only, and
I can safely say it is an extremely difficult nest to discover.
Both of those I found were on a common, and although it was an
extensive one, and the bird chould have chosen a quiet place, yet the
nests in both instances were placed close to a footpath and hard road
on the edge of the common.
The nest is placed right on the ground, and these particular nests
were not placed under large bushes nor in tall tufts of grass, as in some
cases, but were placed in quite short furze with just a little grass growing
through it, but were carefully concealed.
These.nests I found at the end of May, and both contained young
a few days old.
I sat down within 4 feet of one nest to watch the parents
feed their young. The cock bird would show himself now and again
with a large moth or sometimes a caterpillar in his mouth, but the hen
I never saw, so careful was she that, although I could almost see the
nest and had my eyes fixed on the spot, she got on her nest each time
without my seeing a sign of her.
The eggs are of a pinkish ground colour with numerous spots of
rusty red, in some the eggs are much more spotted than others, appearing
as if sprinkled with cayenne pepper.
The Grasshopper Warbler will, like other insectivorous birds, rear
their own young in captivity quite easily if given plenty of live ants'
eggs, small mealworms, and a few green caterpillars ; the latter can
be found in plenty rolled up in nettle leaves ; it is the caterpillar of
the pearl moth.
This bird will reel in captivity at intervals all day, but is silent
after July until the following spring.
The cage most suitable should be long--about 30 inches long,
13 inches high, and 9 inches deep ; it should have a few small
tufts of grass and heather placed on the floor of the cage and a perch
each end, and one long perch level with the front rail. This bird will
enjoy walking about and threading its way through grass and heather.
They do not fly far at a time, and it is wonderful how this bird
ever covers the distance in migrating.
If you see the Grasshopper Warbler on perhaps a small oak sapling,

or bush, as I have seen him, on being disturbed he either runs down a
bough to the ground like a mouse, or else drops or flutters down into
a small piece of furze, and if the observer kicks the bush, instead of the
bird flying a distance away, he just lazily comes out and falls into the
next bush often only a couple of yards away.
This species appears to feel the cold in winter more than most of
the other Warblers, and requires heat: a temperature up to 65 degrees
is quite suitable.
The feeding of this species in captivity should be the same as
recommended for the Nightingale, but I always, in the way of titbits,
gave it occasionally a few house flies, or when I found a few small
spiders I gave them ; sometimes in my rambles I came across some
small green smooth caterpillars on the low oak boughs, I thought of the
Grasshopper Warbler and put them into an empty matchbox for him,
and he always appreciated them, for this bird is purely insectivorous,
and does not eat fruit or berries.

short notes on their wild life and full directions as to their treatment
in captivity, their breeding, etc., while the whole is well illustrated,
the two volumes containing sixty odd coloured plates, and some 600
black and white illustrations. It is certainly a book no bird-keeper

price, but my two volumes cost #1 and 305. respectively second-hand ;
they are more than worth that to me.
Of all the insects which are used for living bird-food, and which
can be bred without much difficulty, the mealworm is the most
important.
This is the larval stage of the meal-beetle, and has been bred from
early times. In the Gefiederte Welt., 1903, p. 125, D. Waschinsky, of
Berlin, the owner of a large mealworm breeding establishment, gave
an account of his methods and directions how to achieve success and
avoid the many mishaps and failures which attended his early efforts.
He writes : " Mealworms are commonly kept in pots, glass jars,
or tins, but these are not fit places for breeding, and seldom produce
successful results. If such a pot or tin, which is fairly full, is examined,
it will be found that the interior is markedly warmer than the air of
the room in which it stands ; this heat is caused by the continual move
ment of the worms, and by their rubbing one against another, and the
result is that the interior of the pot becomes wet and sweating, and the
bran, in which the insects live, damp and soggy. All this favours the
development of the worms' greatest enemy, and their breeder's bugbear,
mite ; when these appear, the whole brood is lost, the bran becomes
a black, sticky mass with a mouldy putrid smell, and the owner can
do nothing but throw the whole thing away. All this can be avoided
by the use of wooden boxes with lids, to which perforated zinc is fixed
to provide ventilation, and which fit inside the rim of the box resting
on a narrow batten all round. The size of the box does not matter
very much, except that its depth should not be more than 10 to 12
inches, for deeper ones are no good. Boxes fitted with narrow strips
of metal all round inside, to prevent the insects crawling up and escaping
are in actual practice useless, for in time, owing to the drying and warping
of the wood, channels form which allow their passage. In proper boxes,

feeding the worms is quite easy, and when they have been in use for
some time the whole thing can be limewashed and scrubbed with sand,
and so thoroughly cleaned and the wood preserved. Do not attempt
limewashing when the box is well-peopled, for then the moisture caused
will only help towards the development of mite.
A small table should be fixed in the middle of the breeding-box, and
its top surrounded by a narrow rim to form a tray, on which the
moistened food for the worms can be placed. This device prevents the
development of damp in the litter itself, and it, as a matter of fact, is
the main instrument to success. The box is to be filled with white
bran reaching up to the level of the food-tray, and to avoid the intro-
duction of meal-mites with the bran, 0. M. Kisch recommends that it
should be baked in an oven at a good heat before use.
The box is now ready for the reception of the beetles, worms,
pupae, or eggs. Beetles are difficult to obtain, so one usually starts
with the worms, the whole development of which (worm, pupa, beetle,
eggs, worm again) is most interesting to watch. As to the number of
worms to be used to start operations, opinions vary, but too few are
better than too many, for frequently when too many are introduced
the resulting harvest does not equal what was put in. A friend of mine
took 8 pounds of mealworms, which in spite of my warnings, he put
into two boxes ; his final result only totalled 2 pounds, while I have
obtained as many as 80 pounds from 8. My advice is to start with
1,000 worms, 900 pupae or 800 beetles, for a box with a floor area of
12 by 12 inches. 1 It may be asked why more worms than beetles. The
answer is that 1,000 worms produce 800 beetles, the other 200 dis-
appearing for one reason or another. As soon as the worms, pupae,
or beetles have been introduced, the box is in breeding order, and for
food, pieces of crumbled white or black bread must be placed on the
tray, and a good supply of discs of carrot added in such quantity and
renewed often enough to ensure the worms never being without food
for more than two days. When carrots are scarce, lettuce stalks can
be used, or if neither are obtainable and the bread stale, it must be
1 The illustration in the original shows a larger floor-area than this, about
18 by 18 inches, that is, in relation to the height (10-12 in.) as given above. This
seems a more natural and more suitable size.--E. H.

soaked and more or less dried before crumbling on to the tray. This
food suits both beetles and worms--the tray will be always found
swarming with them--but without moist food both beetles and worms
die quickly. What remains of the food should be removed every two
days, and with it all refuse, which has collected, not only on the tray,
but any which has fallen into the bran. This is also eaten by the insects,
as one sees from the powdery state to which it is reduced, and fresh
bran must be added from time to time, but never much at a time. For
satisfactory breeding, at least two boxes are required, and as soon as
beetles appear they must be left undisturbed in the bran ; directly
dead ones are found, a second box should be started for further breeding,
and the first now used as a food supply for the birds. Finally, I should
say that the best temperature for mealworm-breeding is that of an
ordinary room and that too much warmth is just as bad as too great
cold. Breeding may be started at any time of the year.
The development of a meal-beetle takes about a year, and from
five to seven months after the laying of the eggs a good supply of food-
worms ought to be available. These should be collected from the
food tray, and not hunted for among the bran.
Mites which have gained access to a breeding-box, may, if dis-
covered early enough, be expelled by heat applied in such a way that
it is first felt at the bottom of the box ; as the heat gradually rises
through the litter, they come to the top to escape it; then if a piece
of linen is spread on the top of the bran, they will all collect on this
and eventually can all be removed en masse on it. Mites can crawl up
even glass or polished metal. One can also recommend warming of the
box at night, and removal of the cloth every morning, leaving the box
afterwards to stand all day in the air or, better still, in the sunlight,
as the latter in a very few days will get rid of all the mites and destroy
their eggs. The worms, pupae, and beetles suffer no harm from such
heating, though naturally, care must be taken that the heat is not too
great or applied for too long. (See Gef. Welt., 1903, 311.)
As regards the use of mealworms for feeding birds, the following
recommendations should be followed. Except under exceptional
circumstances they should not be given in large quantities or as a regular
food. Their special value is for the " meating-off " of fresh-caught

birds, and these will often need an abundant supply ; birds which have
been longer in captivity should only have them as treats and during
the moult, or as a stimulus to song in its season. The giving of too many
mealworms, except to birds in song, may be the cause of all sorts of
diseases, such as ulcers of the feet (in Redstarts), brain-trouble shown
by fits or staggers (Warblers), cramps, and other affectations. Meal-
worms are also of great value in the rearing (by hand or by their parents)
of young birds ; for this the softest whitest worms should be selected,
and, if necessary, be freshly skinned. Although birds as a rule can
quite easily deal with the live insect, many keepers pinch the worm's
head before giving it, and this should always be done when they are
to be added to a food-mixture. Small birds should only have small or
medium-sized worms, as they might have difficulty in swallowing
larger ones.

and New Guinea, either Batchian, Morotai, Obi, or Raou, in 1918 ;
being apparently quite a young bird, sex unknown, but believed
to be a female, anyhow she was named " Poppy A description is
unnecessary, as Mr. Dempster has done her ample justice; her measure-
ments, however, are as follows, total length about 11 inches, wings
6 inches, tail 3J inches, tarsus # (0-75), culmen 1 inch. She is at liberty
to do just as she pleases. During the summer she spends the whole of
her time out of doors, climbing trees and pulling flowers to pieces;
carnations and pinks are her favourites, she thrusts her brush-like
tongue into the centre of these, and then tears them open. She is very
clumsy on the ground, taking long jumps, and as often as not falling
over, a poor flyer, rarely rising more than a few feet above the ground,
but she is very fond of climbing a small tree about 10 feet high, and
gliding off, shrieking meanwhile ; she always seems to land rather
heavily, but does not appear to mind, as she will repeat the performance
several times. I am not afraid of cats getting her, as I have two

Scotties, with both of whom she is on quite good terms, unless they
try and steal her milk, and then there are many angry words on her
part. She is a great bather, and seldom misses a day unless very cold.
An excellent whistler, quite a conversationalist, but at times difficult
to follow, a fair mimic, exceedingly inquisitive, and passionately fond
of music. She dislikes strangers, and is very hostile to other birds,
especially to a little all-green Parakeet, which is also at liberty. Her
food consists of Nestle's Milk made rather weak, one teaspoonful to four
tablespoons of boiling water, served slightly warm ; she likes the
milk just as it is, and generally refuses it if any biscuit, Mellin's Food,
or honey is added, very occasionally I am able to add a little cornflour.
All fruit juices are welcomed, as are most soft fruits, especially grapes
and oranges, she will sometimes take apple, but not banana, care must
be taken not to give orange and milk together. I have seen her catch
Crane flies, but she makes no attempt to eat them. Honey does not
agree with her unless it is well diluted ; once during an absence she
was given some straight from the comb, and she was very queer
internally for several days. This is the only occasion she has been ill,
and although her diet is so limited, she is always in perfect condition.
She is quite tame for a Lory, and loves to sit on the back of my chair
and run her beak through my hair ; she will sit on my hand, but
dislikes being stroked, a liberty which is on no account tolerated from
a stranger. She is very playful, and her favourite toy is an old gold
bracelet, which she tosses into the air, after which she dances round it,
tapping her beak on the ground. She has a passion for a small wooden
box cage with the wire front removed, and becomes most excited if
she cannot find it. If she is up a tree, and I whistle, and hold her cage
up for her to see, she immediately comes down and gets in, always
through a circular hole in the side, and never through the front. The
floor of this cage is covered with about If inches of sawdust, to which
a little Sanitas powder is added, this is of course changed daily. She
seldom sleeps on a perch, but makes a " scrape " in a corner. Moderate
cold and rain she does not mind, but wind she hates. Of course, she
is not allowed out in the winter, but is kept in a conservatory. Taken
all round, she is a most interesting bird, and makes an ideal pet as long
as she is kept out of the house.

By Annie C. Thompson
Unlike the Green Cormorant which rarely leaves the rocky coast-
line, the Black Cormorant is a wandering bird. It has been recorded
from almost every county of the British Isles, and is a well-known
visitor to the fens of Cambridgeshire from time to time.
My specimen was caught on cultivated land near Soham. It was
mistaken for an otter, chased into a drain-pipe, secured by the neck
with a pitchfork, and transferred to a sack. In this it was brought to
an ornithological friend of mind who, having no suitable place in
which to keep it, passed it on to me.
Happening to have a sufficiently large covered aviary vacant, I
hastily improvised three bass rocks of brickwork, filled up the cement
tank (which was far too small) with water, and introduced the bird to
its new quarters. By this time it was quite dark, so I scattered several
pieces of fish about the floor, and left the Cormorant to settle down.
In the morning I found it was very wild, and continually flew on to
the wires of its cage, to which it clung with its webbed feet in the
cleverest manner. It had not touched any of the carefully counted
pieces of fish.
As he continued to refuse food, I decided on the following morning
to try forcible feeding. I put on a pair of stout leather gloves, protected
my eyes with goggles, and entered the cage.
I caught my bird without much difficulty, but his neck came round
like a flash of lightning. The hooked point of his beak caught my arm
between the top of the gauntlet and my rolled-up sleeve, a contact
which resulted in an incision 3 inches long. Fortunately I was able to
slide my hand higher up the neck without letting go my hold, and my
husband put small pieces of fish into his beak.
He swallowed a considerable number of these, and then declined
to take any more, so we let him go, and left some food on the ground,
which again he refused to touch.
The sixth day he fed from my hand readily, and showed con-

siderable skill in catching pieces thrown to him as he sat on his pile of
bricks.
On the eighth morning I found him waiting for me at the cage
door, and on the eleventh I began to feed him from the inside of the
aviary. He did not allow me to stroke him until the twenty-second
day, but after that he made rapid progress, and on the twenty-fifth
he jumped into my lap as I was stooping to feed him.
Next day I got a friend to clip one of his wings, and put him out
on the lawn, with the result that he went straight back to his cage.
However, he soon became perfectly used to freedom, and got to like
it so much that he had to be enticed home with a display of fish.
He preferred company, and would sit down on an arrangement of
bricks at my feet in perfect contentment so long as I was reading or
sewing, but if I got up and wandered down the garden, he would
spread both his wings and come sailing after me in a series of long hops,
so as not to let me out of his sight. Whenever left alone, he sought
a perch at some height from the ground, the back of a garden seat, or
preferably the sundial.
He did not readily take to water, and absolutely declined to pick
up pieces of fish put in it; while he tolerated rather than enjoyed a
gentle spray from the hose-pipe.
He greatly enjoyed a game of pretending to catch him by the
feet, and would dance up and down just out of reach, waving his
wings, and uttering sharp cries between a caw and a bark for as long
as I cared to continue the game.
He was intolerant of great heat, which made him gasp and droop
his wings. He disliked wind, and in wintry weather always sought
the most sheltered of his indoor bass rocks.
I fed him entirely on fish, and although he showed a decided
preference for small herrings, which he swallowed whole, he would
eat practically any sort. Large bones he rejected, small ones he
swallowed and returned again in the form of a pellet. On several
occasions he came across frogs while loose, but although he invariably
killed he never ate them.
My experience is that weeks, sometimes months, are required to
make a really wild bird tame, and the extraordinarily short time

which elapsed before this one became not only tame but an affectionate
pet surprised me extremely.
We called him Cavendish because of his strong resemblance to a
shag, but we were never sure of his sex, especially when he developed
the habit of making nests with stray pieces of stick and other oddments,
such as gardening gloves.
When he first came to me he had the blue iris of a young bird.
While with me this changed to green, the mantle became much brighter,
and signs of white patches appeared on the thighs, but he never reached
full maturity. He began to mope and then to decline food during a
prolonged absence I took from home, and although everything possible
was done for him he died before I got back, and I could only give him
an honoured resting-place beside the Linnet and the Jay.
I have never had a more interesting pet, nor one with more character
and individuality, and none, I think, whose loss I so much regretted.

The Cage Bird Show at the Palace on the 6th, 7th, and 9th February
was a great success, and the foreign bird classes were, on the whole,
well supported. One missed the fine collection, which last year helped
so much, from the late Mrs. Dalton-Burgess, whose recent death has
been a blow to the foreign bird interest, but it was very satisfactory to
find such a strong team shown by Mr. Hubert Whitley, whose enterprise
in transporting so large a number of rarities from Paignton is to be
highly commended.
Budgerigars appeared to be becoming exceedingly popular, and
one hears of a club being formed especially to look after their interests.
At the show, besides a number of the familiar yellows and greens, one
saw the exquisite sky-blue and the less common cobalt-blue varieties.
We heard of mauve, white, olive, and other varieties, but surely the
sky-blue will never be beaten for beauty ?
The class for Lories and Lorikeets contained a very fine Musky
Lorikeet (1st prize) and a nice pair of Yellow-backed Lories (2nd),
both owned by Mr. Frostick, while Mr. Whitley obtained third with a
good Black-capped Lory.

In the class for Lovebirds, Brotogerys, etc., Mr. Frostick came first
with a very good pair of Orange-flanked Parrakeets, a second pair of
the same species obtaining third prize for Captain Rattigan. Second
was awarded to Mr. Whitley for a good pair of Rosy-faced Lovebirds.
There were two pairs of Abyssinian Lovebirds in this class ; this
species, once so rare, having become a comparatively common cage-bird
now. It is quite possible, however, that in a few years it may be as
rare as ever again unless amateurs will breed it. Its present abundance
may be due to a chance importation which may not occur again.
Rosellas, Redrumps, Ringnecks, etc.--In this class Mr. Whitley
scored the first three honours with a pair of Banded, an Alexandrine,
and Blossom-head, all first-class birds. Mr. Maxwell's Redrumps came
fourth. There were only three entries in the class for Conures, and here
Mr. Whitley took first prize with a bird that no one present could name.
It is a very rare Conure, which should one of these days make a journey
to South Kensington for identification. Its condition was perfect.
The same exhibitor obtained second prize with an excellent pair of
Golden-fronted Conures, while third went to Mr. Frostick for a pair
of Green Conures, either C. leucojphthalmus or C. holochlorus.
The class for Broad Tails contained seven entries, the first prize
going to Mr. Frostick for a very good Bauer's Parrakeet. Lord
Tavistock's Barnard, a splendid bird, came second, besides which
there were two hen Pennants, a pair each of Kings and Mealy Rosellas.
Amongst the rarer Parrakeets were some real gems, the first
prize going to a splendid Queen Alexandra owned by Lord Tavistock,
while another, almost as good, sent by Mr. Whitley, obtained second
prize. A Rock Peplar belonging to Mr. Maxwell came third, while
a Yellow-bellied Parrakeet, a very rare species nowadays, belonging
to Lord Tavistock, was given fourth prize. Mr. Whitley also sent a
good Blue-bonnet which was awarded V.H.C.
In the class for Hybrids and other curiosities, Mr. Whitley scored
first with a Hybrid Red-rump and Blue-bonnet--a very beautiful and
interesting bird. Second and third prizes were awarded to Mr. Sumner
Marriner for pairs of Black-cheeked and Peach-faced Lovebird Hybrids,
resembling small Peach-faces with dirty faces. Fourth prize went to
Mr. Whitley for a Cinnamon-coloured Java Sparrow.

There was nothing very striking amongst the larger Short-tailed
Parrots, but in the class for Macaws and Cockatoos some treasures.
Mr. Whitley's very fine Hyacinthine and Mr. Maxwell's Lear's Macaw,
obtaining first and second respectively, were a fine couple. The third
prize went to a splendid White-crested Cockatoo owned by Mr. Frostick,
while Mr. Whitley's exceptionally large Sulphur-crest was of especial
interest, as it was hatched and reared at liberty amongst the trees of
Paignton. Unfortunately, one of the parents was subsequently shot
by a neighbour, who should have known better.
Mr. Whitley obtained first, second, and third prizes in the class for
"Any other Species of Parrots", with (1) a very good pair of Red-
capped Parrots, (2) a hen Red-sided Eclectus, and (3) a beautiful little
Yellow-lored Amazon. Mr. Whitley was the sole exhibitor in this, as in
the next class, which was for Quails and Doves : here were four exhibits
which took prizes in the following order : First, a Nicobar Pigeon;
second, a Red Mountain Dove ; third a good cock Peristera cinerea ; and
fourth, an example of the rare West Indian Violet-backed Ground Dove
(Geotrygon chrysia).
The classes for the Commoner Waxbills, etc., might have been better
supported, since these birds are so widely kept. Amongst the Commoner
Mannikins, Mr. Frostick exhibited a pair of Javan White-headed
Mannikins, a species very similar to the Maja Finch of the Malay
Peninsula, but distinguished by its deeper chestnut colour and black
throat and fore-neck.
The next class was for the rarer Mannikins, Quail-finches, Long-
tailed Finches, etc. Here Mr. Whitley took first prize with a nice pair
of Chestnut-breasted Finches, and second with an equally good pair
of Long-tailed Grassfinches. Third prize went to Mr. H. W. Simpson
for a pair of Cherry-finches, rarely seen nowadays, and fourth to a
cock Quail Finch shown by Miss R. Follett.
The class for Gouldians, Diamond, Parrot-finches, and the rarer
Buntings and Waxbills contained thirteen entries. Mr. Frostick
obtained first prize and various specials for a good Violet-eared Waxbill,
Mr. Whitley second with a splendid pair of Rainbow Buntings which
I think should have come first, third went to Mr. Frostick for a
Nonpariel, and fourth to Mr. Stewart for a Red-headed Gouldian.

Mr. Whitley's very fine Versicolor Bunting certainly deserved more
than V.H.C., being, besides its rarity, a very difficult bird to get into
show condition ; and Mr. Maxwell was most unlucky in his Tricoloured
Parrot-finch being overlooked.
In the class reserved for Cuban Finches, Seed-eaters, Grosbeaks, etc.,
Mr. Frostick again came first with a good Bed-crested Finch,
Mr. Whitley second with a Blue Grosbeak, while Mr. E. Allison
obtained third and fourth prizes with an Olive and a Cuba Finch,
both cocks, in excellent condition.
Mr. Whitley came first in the Cardinal class with a beautiful Black-
cheeked Cardinal, a species said to be very common in Guiana and
Venezuela, but very rarely imported. Mr. P. W. D. Barrett obtained
second prize with a Bed-crested and Mrs. Bickerstaff third with a good
Virginian.
The Weaver class was a failure, having only two entries,
Mr. Whitley's Dinemeli Weaver (first) and Mr. Frostick's Bed-
collared Whydah (second).
The Tanager class contained only six entries, Mr. Maxwell's very fine
Superb taking first and special, and his Silver-blue second, while
Mr. Whitley's very fine Archbishop, or more correctly " Ornate ",
came third, the same owner being awarded V.H.C. and H.C. for a good
Superb and a rare Crested Black Tanager, probably Tachyphonus
surinamus. This last deserved a higher award.
Sunbirds, Sugar-birds, and other Tanagers, were poorly repre-
sented by only four entries. Mr. A. Martin took first with a good Purple
Sunbird, the only one in the show ; Mr. Whitley second with a good
Yellow-winged Sugar-bird, another of the same species being shown
by Mr. H. W. Simpson, while Captain Battigan obtained third prize
with a good Chestnut-headed Tanager (Calliste desmaresti), the last
being a very rare species.
Only three entries were obtained in the class for Pekin Bobins,
Shamas, Bulbuls, etc. Mr. Whitley took first and second prizes with
a Bed-eared Bulbul and a Shama, while Mr. J. D. Bruton obtained third
prize with a pair of Liothrix.
The class for Hangnests, Cow-birds, etc., contained but four entries.
Dr. J. du Barrie sent a fine Crested Cassique (first) and a Yellow-

rumped Hangnest (fourth), and Mr. Whitley two Cow-birds (second
and third), but of their exact species I am uncertain.
Mynahs and Starlings, three entries only, and all by Mr. Whitley.*
The first prize went to a fine Pagoda Starling and the second to a Blyth's
Starling, a rare bird.
The Glossy Starlings made up a fine class of ten entries, of which
the best birds in the class were entirely overlooked by the judge. These
were Mr. Whitley's very rare Chestnut-winged Starling (Amydrus
morio), and Burchell's Glossy Starling. Then first prize went to
Mr. Maxwell's pair of Superb Spreos, of which species another example
obtained third prize for Mr. A. Martin. This beautiful Starling, of
which there were five in the class, has been imported in large numbers,
and is no longer a rarity. It is, moreover, a bird that manages to keep
itself in perpetual show condition. The second prize was awarded
to Dr. J. du Barrie for a very nice Purple-headed Glossy Starling ; and
the fourth to a Green Glossy Starling sent by Mr. F. C. Levett.
The class for Crows, Pies, Toucans, etc., contained five entries,
four being from Mr. Whitley. First went to a Bed-billed Toucan of
Mr. Whitley's, the second to another of the same species belonging to
Mr. Frostick. A White-backed Piping Crow of the small Tasmanian
race came third, and a beautiful example of the Australian Crow-shrike
(Strepera) fourth.
The two last were All Other Species classes, the one for birds not
larger, and the other for birds larger, than a Blue Bobin.
In the first of these Mr. Maxwell scored first with a small accentor-
like bird which I could not identify, second and special to a pair of
Tanagers belonging to Mr. Whitley that were also difficult to name,
probably some species of Sallator, third to a Great Saltator, and
fourth to a Golden-fronted Fruit-sucker.
The last class contained a fine pair of Laughing Kingfishers (first
and special) and a Long-tailed Boiler. Five out of the six entries
making up these two classes were from Mr. Whitley's collection.
One would like to see the lighting arrangements improved at the
Palace. In the foreign bird section many of the exhibits could not be
seen at all unless the cages were taken down and held in the light,

Society are deserving of very hearty congratulations on the success of
the undertaking. It is much to he hoped that next year many more
aviculturists will participate, for on this occasion had it not been for
Mr. Whitley's fine collection half the classes would have had to be
cancelled.

LICE IN BIRDS

<bodyText confidence="0.99572856" page_id="56188559"  page_num="111" year="" vol="">
Sir, --To show that one cannot be too careful in examining newly
arrived birds, the following note may be of interest. Last August I
received a number of different birds from a dealer. These all appeared
to be all right and healthy, and after the usual quarantine, which all
my birds undergo, they were placed out in various aviaries. Some three
weeks later I noticed that a pair of gallinaceous birds, and a pair of
small insectivorous birds, part of the above consignment, were ailing.
On examination these were found to be infected with a very small
lice ; one bird was covered with them, giving it quite a grey appearance,
but yet they were so minute that only a close examination revealed
them. The other birds of this consignment were apparently all right.
The badly infected bird soon died, I believe solely from the lice. The
others were isolated and eventually cured. The aviary in which they
had been was disinfected and whitewashed throughout. To-day,
that is, seven months later, I have caught up a Military Starling and
an Orange-headed Marsh Bird, old birds I have had a long while; they
have been caged together in a small aviary, a long way from the
previously infected one, although they both abutted on to the same
wall and there was no other aviary between them. These two birds
are, I find, both infected with the same lice, which must have travelled
along the open wall from one aviary to another. The lice are so small,
that they may easily pass undetected, unless specially looked for. It
would be interesting to know if other aviculturists have had a similar
experience with these filthy pests.

seen cheese mentioned as suitable for birds.
In the February issue of this year, p. 46, the " Little Wilts " cheese
is recommended by the late Mr. Galloway in his very excellent article
on how to keep Nightingales in perfect condition, and by his advice
I have made use of it for a good many years.

afford it to give coloured plates for the Magazine. If several are
done at the same time they are cheaper than single ones. May I say
that I will defray the expense of one for this year if three other members
will do likewise ?
I should like to see a good representation of the different varieties

a pair of Crimson-winged Parrots, accompanied by an article by
yourself ; some other member would perhaps select a Dove ; another
an insectivorous bird, etc.

III. The Whistling Thrushes (Brachypterygince)
This name has been given to a group of birds, which are
distinguished by their long feet and short tails ; their habits are mainly
terrestrial. These birds greatly resemble the true Thrushes ( Turdidce )
having about the same habits, and they form a link between them and
the Timeliidse. I consider even, with several ornithologists, that it is
among the Thrushes that they should be placed. However, their young
are not spotted, which is an important characteristic feature of the
Turdidce, and generally they are not migratory. Their eggs are spotted.
They are found in Asia and in Oceania.
Although this group is fairly important, only three species of the
genus Myophoneus have been imported ; they are big birds with a
strong beak, rather shorter than the head ; the eye is large, the
feet long and strong, the tail short, and the plumage, generally speaking,
of a dark blue coloration. The two sexes are identical.
The Himalayan Whistling Thrush (M. temmincki) inhabits these
mountains, and those of the neighbouring regions ; it is met with along
the torrents and it feeds chiefly on molluscs, the shells of which are
found in heaps near the places it frequents. It is dark blue, each feather
being terminated with metallic blue ; lores and bottom of forehead
black ; remainder of forehead cobalt blue ; wings and tail black,
the feathers being edged outside with cobalt blue ; small feathers of
wings black edged outside with metallic blue, some tipped with

white ; yellow beak with culm and base of the upper mandible blackish,
claws black. It measures nearly 40 cm. in length.
This bird lives well in a cage or an aviary and requires to be treated
like a Thrush. It has a pretty whistling call.
The Chinese Whistling Thrush ( M . cceruleus) is distributed over
the whole of China ; it is distinguished from the preceding by its
smaller size (33 cm.) and its black beak. The wing is not marked with
white.
It frequents the banks of watercourses, and feeds chiefly on aquatic
insects. Its voice is sweet and of great compass ; it reminds one of the
Blue Bock Thrush, which it also somewhat resembles in other respects.
Horsfield's Whistling Thrush (M. horsfieldi) inhabits the centre
of Southern India, where it frequents the banks of streams in the
hills. It is a little larger than the preceding species. Its beak is black.
IV. The Sibias ( Sibiince )
The Sibias are of medium or small size, varying from that of a
Lark to that of a Goldfinch ; they are of arboreal habits, and do not
migrate ; the sexes are similar. Their plumage is generally brilliant,
and they are met with in more or less numerous flocks. Their eggs are
spotted.
The Sibias inhabit India, China, Indo-China, and the East Indies.
Some species are imported and make excellent cage birds and
good aviary birds in the summer. They require the diet of small
insectivorous birds, with fruit.
The Black-headed Sibia ( Lioptila capistrata) is frequently met
with in captivity ; it has a slender, rather curved beak, the head is
quite covered with a short black crest; all the under part of the body,
the rump and a collar of a bright pinkish red ; greyish brown back,
very long reddish tail, with a black band terminating with blue grey ;
wings variegated grey and red, with a white band. It measures about
23 cm.
This beautiful bird inhabits the Himalayas. I have seen it at
Darjeeling. It is easily tamed, and is charming in captivity; some
specimens become remarkably tame.

The Blue-winged Siva ( Siva cyanuroptera) is a pretty little bird of
15 cm., 6.cm. of which are tail. It is reddish olive above, very pale fawn
below, with the top of the head, the nape, the back of the neck, the
wings, and the tail sky-blue, more or less striped or marked with black
and white ; beak light yellow, claws flesh-coloured.
This delightful little bird comes over at rare intervals ; it is tame
and hardy, when once acclimatized, and requires the ordinary food of
insectivorous birds. It inhabits the Himalayas, and is seen flitting
about the trees in small flocks seeking for insects under the leaves.
Allied species inhabit the Malay Peninsula, Indo-Ohina, etc.
The Yuhinas have a medium-sized beak, curved and pointed, a
fairly short square tail, and a well-developed crest. They live in small
flocks on trees, and feed on small berries and insects. They are
found in India and China in the mountains.
Several Yuhina gularis have recently been imported from Nepaul,
from Sikhim and from Bhutan. These are small birds, olive brown
tinged with red, and are not very striking to look at.
The Yuhina nigrimentum has also been imported from the
Eastern Himalayas ; its forehead feathers and those of the crest
are black, edged with grey ; the nape and the sides of the head grey ;
the lores and the chin black ; the throat white ; the upper part of
the body olive brown, and the under part tawny red.
The genus Ixulus only differs from Yuhina in the shorter, thicker
beak. They have a heavy crest. They inhabit the Himalayas, Malay
Peninsula, and China. To my knowledge, only one species has been
imported from the Himalayas, Ixulus flavicollis, which has a brown
head and crest with the parotic regions grey, the lores and a long
moustache black, the nape and the back of the neck bright red, the
upper part of the body olive brown, the under part white with a
tawny tinge.
V. The Liotrix (Liotrichince)
The Hill-Tit or Pekin Eobin is the most popular bird of the whole
family. Every one knows and appreciates it; as a matter of fact it
combines all good qualities ; it has charming plumage, a peculiar and
graceful carriage, and a pretty voice. Moreover, it is regularly imported.

It is the group type which is of interest to ns here ; all the birds
composing it are of aboreal habits ; there is a slight difference between
the sexes; generally speaking, they lay spotted eggs. Otherwise
they present all the characteristics of the Timeliidse, especially short
wings and strong claws.
The Hill-Tit or Pekin Eobin ( LiotJirix luted) is too well known to
require a detailed description ; the beak is red ; upper part of the
body olive green, the forehead tinged with yellow ; tail notched,
black, with long olive green coverts, terminated with white ; a
yellow line passes over the eye ; a dark green moustache separates
the olive green of the cheeks from the bright yellow of the throat,
which spreads over the whole of the lower part of the body and is
tinged with orange red on the breast; the wings are brilliantly marked
with yellow, orange, and red on a background of dark olive green. The
hen shows the same colours, but considerably duller, and has no red
on the wings ; the forehead has no yellow.
The typical species inhabit China and is replaced by a very similar
species (L. calipygus) in the Himalayas.
In the wild state, the Pekin Eobin lives in little flocks in thick
jungles ; it feeds on insects, berries, fruits, and grain. It builds in
some thick bush a cup-shaped nest composed of dead leaves, roots
of grasses and moss, and usually lays three pale green eggs marked with
brownish red.
In captivity, the Pekin Eobin is very easy to keep, it eats anything,
including seeds ; canary seed, whole and crushed hempseed. But
that does not suffice for it; it ought to be given insectivorous bird
food and fruits. A cock bird alone makes a charming cage bird ;
couples, in an aviary, are one of the most beautiful ornaments in it;
they are inoffensive towards their companions, and have only two
faults: they are too fond of hiding in the bushes and are inclined to
devour eggs; precautions must be taken in this respect. They can
stand our climate perfectly well all the year round in the open air,
and are easily bred in captivity as long as they have space and bushes
at their disposal and are supplied with insects for rearing their young.
I have described under the name of LiotJirix astleyi , dedicated
to my friend, Mr. H. D. Astley, who has studied birds so well and keeps

.such a fine collection of them, a Liothrix brought from an unknown
locality in China. One pair of these birds reached me in 1921. The cock
is similar to L. lutea , but has the forehead, the belly, and the eye-
brows brilliant yellow, and the breast is carmine. It is a much more
beautiful bird than the ordinary species.
The Silver-eared Mesia (. Mesia argentauris) greatly resembles the
Liothrix. It is rather stouter, has a longer tail, a shorter body, a larger
beak, the head feathers can be raised into a sort of very short crest.
It is found in the Himalayas, the Malay Peninsula, and Indo-China ;
it is replaced in Sumatra by a more beautiful species, M. laurince.
The cock bird has a yellow forehead ; the top of the head is black
as well as the nape, the lores, the cheeks, and a moustache surrounding
the parotic regions, which are light silver grey ; the back and the coverts
of the wings are greenish grey, the belly olive green ; the remiges are
marked with black, orange yellow, and red ; the tail is black, with the
coverts orange red, which is also the tint of a ring round the neck and
the whole of the breast; the throat is yellow. The hen is duller ; the
coverts of her tail are tawny orange.
The Mesias live in the mountains, and their habits are very similar
to those of the Liothrix. Their song is similar but louder. They are
much scarcer in captivity, but nevertheless arrive from time to time.
They must be treated like the Liothrix. They have bred in aviaries,
especially with Mr. Pauwels.
The Minla (Minla jerdoni) has rarely been imported. It is a charming
little bird from Szechuen (China), a similar species existing in the
Himalayas (M. igneitincta) ; it is olive grey above, with a black head,
and a long white eyebrow which is prolonged as far as the back ; the
throat and the lower parts are yellowish white variegated with olive
brown on the sides ; tail feathers black, edged with red ; coverts of the
wings and secondary remiges black, tipped with white ; primaries
black, edged with red at the base, and with yellow at the end.
A group of curious little birds from India and China, the Para-
doxornis , are connected with the Timeliidse ; they, also have affinities
with the Tomtits, which they resemble in their habits. Their
characteristic is a short and very deep beak, which gives them a peculiar
appearance.

One species of this group at least has been imported, viz.
Scceorhynchus ruficeps from the Himalayas, which, unlike^ the other
Paradoxornis , has a short tail; it is an olive brown bird, tinged with
white below, with the head and the top of the back maroon colour.

THE TITMICE

The Titmice (Paridce) are pretty birds which are distinguished by
their thickset forms, a short beak, strong legs armed with curved
claws, short and wide wings, a medium tail slightly scalloped, an
abundant soft plumage in which blue, yellow, black, and white pre-
dominate. Very frequently the two sexes are approximately of the
same appearance. The various genera and species of this family are
distributed all over the world, with the exception of tropical America
and Polynesia. Their diet is composed of insects, but also of berries,
fruits, and seeds. They are met with in the forests and the woods as
well as in parks and gardens, where they attract attention by their
vivacity and their activity. They breed very freely and generally
build their nest in hollow trees.
The song of all the Titmice is insignificant, but the beauty of their
plumage, their lively movements, their gaiety and their acrobatic
turns, are a pleasure to watch, and an aviary arranged to hold
some species of these birds will always charm the bird fancier.
The Titmice are endowed with an excessively wrangling disposition,
and often give way to fits of anger ; the feathers of the head become
erect, their claws contract with extraordinary force, their cries become
more piercing, and with redoubled blows of the beak they attack the
cause of their bad humour. Two species, the Coal Titmouse and the
Blue Titmouse, are principally subject to these fits of anger, and in
a small cage it is advisable not to put them with birds less strong than
themselves.
In order to keep the Titmice in excellent condition they require
a fairly varied diet; paste for insectivorse--half-crushed seeds (hemp,
sunflower) and fruits. Opened nuts are an excellent delicacy for their
health. Finally, it is indispensable to supply certain species with living

food, such as mealworms. The aviary, which should be fairly large,
must be supplied with nesting-logs which are used by most of the
species to sleep in.
The Great Titmouse (Parus major) has a superb livery, marked with
yellowish olive green and bluish grey. On the head a brilliant black
frames the very white cheeks in the form of a triangle, and is found
again on the neck, the throat and the middle of the abdomen where it
forms a longitudinal streak. This streak is smaller and also less pro-
longed in the case of the female.
This Titmouse, which we encounter in all the country districts, and
even sometimes in large gardens in towns, is lively and active. Of all
the Titmice, it is the one whose song is most agreeable ; between
February and June its voice is very frequently heard. It has a clear
and free call which somewhat resembles that of the Chaffinch. It nests
in the holes of trees and also in cracks in old walls, sometimes in the
abandoned nest of a Magpie or of a Crow.
The Blue Titmouse (Parus coeruleus), with its delicately coloured
plumage, is the commonest member of the family. It has a blue
head and white cheeks ; a collar of a bluish black runs from the throat
to the nape of the neck; a line of the same colour starts from the
beak and connects this collar to the throat; another rejoins it at the
nape and passes by the eye. Back, olive green ; abdomen yellow, with
a blue spot; wings and tail, bluish. The female has duller colours.
Except in coniferous woods, where it is rarely seen, it is found
everywhere. By its habits and its movements, it resembles the Coal
Titmouse ; it is very impudent, and gets into every trap, and it is
the hardiest and fiercest of the family. It builds its nest in the hole
of a tree.
The Marsh Titmouse (Parus palustris) is a small Titmouse with
a modest livery, but it is perhaps the most lively and agile of the
family. The top of the body is of a light reddish brown, the abdomen
a light grey, a black cap descends very low on to the nape of the neck ;
the chin is of the same black, and the cheeks whitish.
It is a reduced edition of the Blackcap. It is very nice in the
aviary on account of its vivacity and its dexterity in movement;
on the bars and on the wire netting, it executes the most amusing

.gymnastics. I have often seen my Marsh Titmice suspend themselves
by one leg, head downwards, on the netting forming the ceiling of the
aviary, and pecking at a piece of nnt held on the other foot in the
attitude of a Parrot. These Titmice become tame very rapidly;
they nest in the holes of trees.
These three species of Titmice can stand captivity very well, for
they can easily vary their insect diet with all sorts of seeds. They
adjust these latter between their claws, and pierce them with marvellous
dexterity by blows of the beak. They breed in a large aviary, and the
Marsh Titmouse, allied to the Blue Titmouse, has sometimes produced
beautiful hybrids bearing the hall-mark of their double origin.
Two other Titmice much less common than the preceding ones,
frequent the coniferous forests together. The first is the Coal Titmouse
(Parus ater), known also by the name of Small Coal Titmouse. The
head and the top of the breast are black, the cheeks white and a spot
of the same colour is on the nape of the neck, the top of the body ashy
grey mixed with olive green, the breast white, tinted with grey, and
two white bands on the wing.
Living especially on insects, it constantly examines the pines and the
oaks, always making its little cry heard. With great foresight, it lays
up supplies which it hides like the Nuthatch in the fissures of tree-
trunks. In captivity it very soon becomes familiar, but retains this
instinct, and the titbits which it takes out of one's&apos; hand, are quickly
hidden away in the corners of the aviary. It frequently returns to
visit its hidden stores, and sometimes it is the cause of a quarrel with
a Blue Titmouse which has discovered the hoard. It also makes its
nest in the holes of trees.
The Crested Titmouse (Pams cristatus) inhabits the same v localities
as the Coal Titmouse, where it finds the same food. It is a very pretty
little Tit which can be recognized by its black crest edged with whitish-
grey, which it continually erects. The mantle, wings, and tail are of a
reddish grey, the throat and the front of the neck black ; a collar of
the same colour surrounding a wider white collar goes up as far as the
occiput.
This Titmouse is extremely vivacious ; it hops without stopping
from one branch to another &apos;with energetic movements and the crest

in motion. It utters a call note resembling the rolling of a drum.
In captivity it is charming, very sociable, not in any way fierce. It
makes its nest in the hole of a tree, sometimes in an old Crow's nest -;
one day I had the surprise of finding a brood in an abandoned Squirrel's
nest. In a large aviary it has been known to breed in a nesting-log.
These two latter Titmice require a very insectivorous regime if they are
to be preserved for a long time in captivity.
We now pass on to a small Titmouse somewhat different from the
other species as regards its form and nidification. This is the Long-
tailed Titmouse (Mgithalus caudatus roseus), a small bird measuring
15 centimetres in length, of which 8 represent the tail; its
plumage is of fresh and velvety shades ; the background is black and
white, shaded with russet pink and ash coloured. The variety which
we have seen in France has bright red borders round the eyes and
traversed by a black band.
This Titmouse is much gentler and more peaceable than the other
species ; it frequents the woods and gardens. During the cold season
it approaches human dwellings. Essentially insectivorous, it only
feeds on insects of the smallest size and on their eggs. Its nest, in
the form of a lengthened purse, is a little masterpiece of art and of
patience, which is admirably made so as to be mistaken for the bark
of the tree on which it rests.
The Long-tailed Titmice are interesting birds in captivity. During
the first days they require a great deal of care, but as soon as they are
accustomed to their new regime they become very familiar. Their
graceful movements, the gentleness of their manners, are pleasant to
observe. Sometimes the males utter a very shrill little song. They
become accustomed to the aviary more quickly when several of them
are together because, like when at liberty, they all follow one after
another. In the evening they always assemble at the same spot, and
they cuddle very closely together one against the other to sleep ; they
then form nothing more than a big parcel of feathers, from which the
long tails emerge to the right and to the left.
The typical form of the species (JE. c. caudatus) inhabits the north
of Europe and of Asia, but especially in winter we sometimes find it
among the troops of our resident Long-tails. These birds are

slightly larger than ours, and the head and the neck are of a pure white.
For a certain time I kept some specimens of this species which had
reached me from Eastern Prussia in my collection of Titmice.
Two other birds classed in another genus, connect themselves with
the family of Titmice : the Bearded Titmouse, or the Reed Titmouse,
and the Penduline Titmouse. These two birds, which are much rarer
than all the others, inhabit swampy places.
The Bearded Titmouse (Panurus biarmicus) is greatly sought for
by amateurs on account of its beauty and its attractive habits. The
male has a russet brown coat, with the head of a fine ashy grey, on
which stand out the fine black feathers forming the beard. In the
females the top of the head is light brown, and there is no beard.
They feed on insects, small molluscs, and aquatic seeds ; they build
their nests in the reeds and the male shares the duty of incubation
with his female.
In captivity these Titmice are charming ; a single individual would
certainly not live very long, for these birds, which are very affectionate,
are always in couples and show great tenderness to one another. The
male and the female constantly follow and ceaselessly caress each other,
and sleep closely pressed against one another. They always require
a big bath, for they bathe very frequently, and love to pursue each other
in the water. It is useful, especially in a small aviary where everything
is artificial, to fix some bars vertically, as these Titmice have the habit
of perching in this way on the reeds.
Bearded Titmice have been induced to breed in a cage. I have had
as many as six pairs of these birds ; they always kept together in
couples, and frequently mated. It is very easy to keep them in good
health by procuring for them, in addition to paste for insectivorous
birds, seeds of white poppy, and especially of ordinary poppy.
The Penduline Titmouse (Anthoscopus pendulinus) is a smaller
bird than the preceding one, and the plumage approaches more closely
to that of the Panurus (Bearded Titmouse); it has no beard, but a black
streak surrounding the forehead, the eye, and the cheek. This Titmouse
is found in Southern Europe : South of France (Camarque, banks of
the Rhone), Spain, Italy ; the South of Eastern Europe as far as
Hungary, and the South of Russia. Seven other forms are found in Asia.

Like the Bearded Titmouse, the Penduline Titmouse is found in
swampy places, and both have the same habits. Its nest is in the
form of an infant's bootee ; of all the European nests, it is the most
curious, and the one most artistically constructed. In captivity, it is
much more delicate than the Panurus (Bearded Titmouse) ; it is very
comical and always in movement. It also requires vertical bars. Its
call is very piercing.
Some species of Titmice inhabiting Asia and Eastern Europe have
at times been reported in Western Europe, the Siberian Titmouse
(Pams sibiricus ), which is also called the White-belted Tit, and the Marsh
Titmouse (Pams lugubris) of South-Eastern Europe, which is of the
size of the Great Titmouse, and has the plumage of the Marsh
Titmouse. One particularly pretty species is the Azure Titmouse
(Pams cyanus ), a lovely bird a little larger than the Blue Titmouse,
but with a prettier coat of azure blue and white.
The foreign Tits are too rarely imported into Europe. These are,
however, some very pretty species. From India the pretty Crested
Titmouse with yellow cheeks (Machlolopus xanthogenys ) has sometimes
reached us.
This Titmouse, which is a little larger than our Crested Titmouse,
has exactly its form and its movements. Back greenish grey, wing
and tail black, with small white spots, head and abdomen golden
yellow, stripes of a brilliant black arranged as in the case of our Coal
Titmouse ; the bird has therefore yellow cheeks framed with black
and a well-developed black crest.
I have had several of these birds which had the same habits and
the same calls as our Titmice. They appear to me very delicate, and
require an enormous quantity of fruit. The following have also been
imported:--
The Black African Titmouse (Parus niger) which inhabits the whole
of this Continent except the North. It is bluish-black, the wings being
spotted with white.
The Variegated Titmouse (P. varius) of Japan ; the forehead, the
cheeks, the lores, the parotic regions, and the sides of the neck are of
a creamy colour ; the remainder of the head is black with a white spot
at the nape ; russet shoulders; upper part of body bluish-grey;
chestnut coloured below.

The Black-headed Canadian Titmouse (P. atricapillus) is of a
light grey, lightly tinted with yellow, with the top of the head and the
throat black, the cheeks, the lores and the sides of the neck white.
The Grey Indian Titmouse (P. cinereus) only differs from the Coal
Titmouse by its considerably smaller size and the top of the body
greyish-blue instead of olive green.
Several other very pretty Titmice have been introduced from the
Himalayas, but they only lived a very short time : Pams monticola,
Mgitholiscus erythrocephalus, Lophophanes melanonotus, and Cepha-
lopyrus flammiceps.
Finally the two varieties of a South African species, a near relative
of the Penduline Titmouse, have been imported, viz. Anthoscopus
capcnsis and A. c. caroli. The first is light brown above, yellowish
below and on the rump ; the second has no yellow and the lower part
of the body is fawn.. The first named inhabits Africa from the Cape
as far as Abyssinia ; the second Damaraland.

THE SHRIKES

By J. Delacour and M. Legendre
The Shrikes constitute the family of the Laniidse. They are birds
with a strong beak, very much compressed, and provided with stiff
bristles at the base ; the upper mandible is hooked and strongly
serrated. The wing is short and rounded, but the tail very long and
tapered. Lively, quarrelsome, and even cruel, they are small birds
of prey, having the courage and the audacity of the larger birds of prey.
They live in the fields and the little woods, where there are large
trees and bushes ; their flight is rather poor and they constantly move
the tail. Apart from their somewhat raucous and monotonous call,
these birds have no particular song ; they have, however, a curious
talent for imitation and imitate perfectly the warbling of other birds.
The Shrikes are insectivorous and carnivorous, hunting not only
the large insects but also small mammals and unfortunately birds,
daring even to attack the large species. They have the curious habit
of carrying off their victims into a bush and of impaling them on the
thorns in order to be able to pull them to pieces more conveniently.

Their cup-shaped nests are very artistically constructed. This family
is represented in all parts of the world except in South America, and
a dozen species of different sizes appear in the fauna of Europe, of which
five which are fairly common are found in France.
The great Grey Shrike (Lanins exeuhitor ) measures from 24 to 25
centimetres in length ; the top of the head, the nape of the neck, and
the back are of a pretty ashy-grey, with a black stripe over the eyes,
the wings are black with white spots, the lower parts pure white. This
bird is widely distributed over the whole of Europe. Being sedentary
(non-migratory), it becomes more common in winter near inhabited
places ; it then likes to perch on a high branch to survey its
surroundings, and, just like a little Hawk, it drops on any prey what-
ever. Formerly it was trained for the chase, and it figured among the
favourite birds of King Francis the First.
The Southern Shrike (Lanins meridionaiis) is of the same size as
the preceding one ; it inhabits the South of Europe and the North-
West of Africa. The upper part of the body is of a very dark ashy-
grey, with a wide black streak on the sides of the head ; breast and
abdomen grey tinted with pink. Its habits are about the same
as those of the preceding species, but it is perhaps even more audacious
and more cruel to the little birds, large numbers of which it destroys.
It builds a very voluminous nest.
The Italian Shrike (Lanins minor) is a very pretty bird which is
also called the Pink-breasted Shrike. If inhabits not only the country
whose name it bears, but also the whole of the South and Centre of
Europe. Its back is of a light ashy-grey colour, the throat white, the
breast and the sides as if glazed with pink, the forehead, the region of
the eyes and of the&apos; ears black, the wings black with a white spot. This
pretty Shrike is one of the most pleasing of the family ; it is perhaps
more insectivorous than the others. Its size is smaller than that of the
preceding ones.
The Busset Shrike (Lanins senator) differs more from the other
species; in this bird the head is of a fine bright russet colour, the forehead
and the region of the eyes and of the ears black, the back and the wings
black, the latter variegated with white, the lower parts whitish. It is
found in Europe and in Africa. On its arrival in France it takes

up its abode in the orchards and copses and immediately starts
breeding.
The Red-backed Shrike (Lanius collurio) is one of the commonest
species ; it is also, with the Russet Shrike, one of the smallest of the
family (17 centimetres). It is distributed all over Europe and in
winter in the North of Africa ; it is very pretty, and the male bird in
spring is truly remarkable for the brightness of its colours. The head,
the nape, and the back are of a bluish ashy colour, the mantle of a
chestnut russet, the throat pure white, the breast and the abdomen
russet pink, with black round the eyes and ears. This little Shrike is
hardy and courageous. It destroys a large number of small birds and,
more than any other, it has the habit of spitting its victims on thorns
and stocking its larder in this way.
In captivity the Shrikes are pleasing owing to their fine colours
and their vivacity ; they very rapidly become tame and live a long
time if they are provided with a mixed diet into which a great deal
of meat must enter. They should therefore be fed on insectile
mixture, small pieces of meat being mixed with it; the best meat
to give to the small species of birds is ox-heart placed for a few seconds
in boiling water. They should also be given some live insects, mice,
and the offal of some small birds.
The amateur who is interested in their habits can put in their cage
a piece of wood provided with long nails, and the Shrikes will make use
of the same to impale their prey. This little larder should be put in a
corner of the cage, and high enough not to injure the birds in their flight.
The Shrikes are very good mimics, imitating the voices of other
birds. Some repeat entire phrases of the song of the Lark, and of the
Warbler, mixing with it the call of the Quail and of the Hoopoe ; it
is a real jumble, which finishes up with the calls of the Jay. But the
sanguinary instincts of these birds and their pronounced taste for
living prey do not, of course, permit of their being kept in an aviary
with other companions, as they frequently attack birds which are even
double their size.
A certain number of exotic Shrikes have been imported. Those of
the genus Lanius do not differ as regards their habits from our native
Shrikes ; these are the Lanius borealis of North America and L. lathora

of Afghanistan and Northern India, which differ very little from the
L. excubitor ; L. collaris, a fine bird from Africa, variegated with black,
white, dark brown, and grey ; L. cristatus, which inhabits the whole
of Eastern Asia and which is russet brown above, whitish below, with
the head marked with black and white ; L. vittatus of India, with a
grey and chestnut head, with the lower parts fawn, the face, the wings
and the tail marked with grey, black, and white. These two latter
species approach the Red-backed Shrike.
The Long-tailed Shrike ( Urolestes melanoleucus) of South Africa
is black, with the wings and the upper covering feathers of the tail
marked with white. By its long tail it reminds one somewhat of the
Whydah bird. It is a savage and stupid bird in captivity ; we have
had individuals in our possession, and cannot recommend it.
There exist in Africa numerous and magnificent Shrikes whose
plumage is frequently adorned with bright colours, especially red and
green. They are more insectivorous and less rapacious than the
Shrikes properly so-called. Although they are not more delicate in
captivity than the others, they are very rarely imported.
Such are the Laniarius atrococcineus, of a brilliant black marked with
white on the wings, with all the lower part of the body of a scarlet red :
it inhabits South Africa ; the Chloroponeus quadricolor of South-
Eastern Africa, green above, red and yellow below, with the head
variegated black and orange.
Another group of Shrikes inhabits Australia and the neighbouring
islands. The species which compose it are similar as regards their
size, their general form, and their habits, to the Corvidae ; they have
the long beak, the well-developed wings, and the fairly short tail of
the Crow. The best known to amateurs is very common in Australia,
where it is called the Magpie (on account of its black and white plumage
and its habits, which somewhat recall those of our European Magpie.)
These large birds in their movements greatly resemble the Rook, with
the beak less broad and more sharp pointed. This beak is white,
passing to dark grey at the end; the plumage is black above and below,
with the nape, the back and the sides of the neck, the coverings of the
wings, the lower part of the back, and the front part of the tail above
and below of a pure white. There is another form which differs by its

stronger build and its entirely white back ( G . leuconota). Certain
individuals have a white back spotted with grey. However this may
be, the Piping Crows are excellent aviary birds. They are almost
always exceedingly familiar, and nature has endowed them, moreover,
with a fluting voice and a great talent for imitation. They imitate
perfectly all kinds of noises and songs, and can enter into rivalry with
the Parrots ; they even succeed in talking.
In captivity they are very hardy ; the diet of the Corvidae suits
them very well (paste, meat, fruits, etc.) ; they are omnivorous. Cold
does not trouble them at all. One can frequently even keep them at
liberty, and they scarcely ever go away. One must, nevertheless,
beware of their carnivorous instincts, as they may cause the same
damage as the Magpies and the Crows. Some species of the allied genus
Cracticus have also been imported, viz. C. destructor, C. picatus, and
C. cassicus. These birds are more tree-loving ; their beak is thicker
at the end and terminates in a more apparent hook. Their plumage is
generally variegated grey, black, and white. They are very attractive
in captivity.

The Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus streperus)
This species is rather late in arriving in this country, one seldom
hears or sees it until long after the Sedge Warbler has arrived.
I have generally first seen it about the 10th of May.
In ditches around water meadows where reeds and meadow-sweet
flourish is their haunt, and also in osier beds, but never far from the
river, as a rule.
I have known them frequent a large pool, overgrown with tall
reeds, in the middle of a meadow where cows used to drink ; this was
about five or six hundred yards away from the river.
In this particular spot I have known five pairs breed, and

for three years in succession have found a young Cuckoo in one of the
nests.
This year, 1923, being a sunless, cold spring, almost up to July,
the reeds did not grow to any height until much later than usual, the
Reed Warblers not nesting till nearly the third week in July, and as
the Cuckoo left soon after 21st June, well up to time, no Cuckoo's egg
was deposited in the Reed Warbler's nest this year in this favourite
pool.
The nest is a beautiful bit of work, being woven round three or four
reed stems, and is very deep ; some nests, however, are quite an inch or
more deeper than others. I have read in some works that the nest is
lined with wool and hair.
Personally all I have found (and I have found many) have been
lined with the brown blossom of the reed bloom or reed grass.
The flesh of the young when a few days old, before the quills appear,
is almost a purplish shade, much darker than the young of the Sedge
Warbler.
The wind may blow and the tall reeds rock backwards and forwards,
but the young in their deep cradle are safe, even when the young are
feathering and have filled up the nest they cling tightly to the fabric
of the nest.
It is curious to find a Reed Warbler's nest in some reeds that have
not fully grown, because when you visit it some time afterwards, the
nest is much higher up the reeds, the reeds have grown and the nest,
as it were, has grown upwards with them.
Not always do these birds build in reeds. I have found the nest
in a lilac-hedge, also up in a pollard-tree some considerable height
from the ground, woven to three of the twigs, also I have found it in
osier beds attached to the rods.
The Reed Warbler is a fine songster ; they sing during the day, but
to hear it at its best, stroll down to its haunt in the summer evening
when the weather is fine and settled, at sunset, he then pours forth some
lovely flute-like notes. They do not sing a hurried, chiding song, like
the Sedge Warbler, but each note is delivered slowly and distinctly,
and in fair variety. I consider the Reed Warbler a pleasing songster.
I think I prefer it to the Garden Warbler.

180 How to Keep Insectivorous Birds in Perfect Condition
This species is of a deep slightly reddish nut-brown all over the
upper parts, the? breast pale buff, lighter on the throat, under tail
coverts also light buff, the outer tail feathers very slightly shorter
than the centre, which does not give the wedge-shaped appearance as
it does in its congener the Sedge Warbler; the rump is slightly chestnut
in colour, the beak is rather long and the mandibles as flat almost as
that of the spotted Flycatcher, there is also a short indistinct buff
streak over the eye, the legs are greenish leaden colour, and the soles
of the feet yellowish, the inside of the mouth bright orange.
These birds move about the tall reeds with great agility, chasing
the small flies which their haunts are infested with, and they make
a very audible snap with their beak in capturing the insects.
They explore the withy beds, climbing up quickly to the tender
shoots at the top, and there devour the little bunches of purplish
coloured blight that collect there.
The cage for this species should be about the size of that used for
the Wood Wren.
These birds should have placed in the cage a few stiff portions of
reeds and a few sticks placed upright at the back of the cage. They do
not care for perching on the ordinary perches placed from back to front
of the cage ; they will, of course, do so, but are more at their ease on the
slanting ones.
When I kept this species I fed it exactly as I did the Wood Warbler,
or Wood Wren as it is called, as this species again is another which
does not require fruit or berries.
Like the Grasshopper Warbler, it requires a little warmth in winter;
it will devour mayflies and stoneflies, and in some seasons the former are
so numerous that one switch into a cloud of them with a butterfly net
will provide more than enough for a couple of days, but it is best to get
a few at a time, as these insects if kept packed in a tin dry up. Of
course, it is not essential that this Warbler should have these, but those
who happen to have this bird, and live near brooks or a river, can
easily procure them.

BREEDING THE RED-BREASTED CONURE
(PYRRHURA VITTATA)
By W. Shore-Baily
Last year I sent you an account of the breeding of the Azara
Parrakeet (Pyrrhura chiripepe ), this season I have been equally
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.996356" page_id="56188585"  page_num="131" year="" vol="">
successful with the nearly allied Pyrrhura vittata , which comes from
Brazil. Early this season I turned my little " Azaras 55 into an outdoor
aviary, but when they had been there about a week the little wretches
found a weak spot in the wire and ate their way out. The weather was
very inclement at the time, and I had little hope of getting them back
again. However, after about a week one of them was picked up in a
dying condition, and the other was recovered a few days later not much
the worse for his adventures. I should like to point out here the
extreme importance of overhauling our aviaries occasionally, as wire
netting even of the best gauge will not last for ever. Following the
escape of the little Parrots, I had a still more serious loss. On entering
their aviary one morning, my man managed to frighten my big
Eagle Owls, from the Falkland Islands, and they flew straight
through the wire and escaped. This aviary had been in use for nearly
twenty years--the wire had no doubt perished. My consternation can
be imagined when these fierce big birds got free, as I had valuable
Pheasants, Ducks, etc., all of which had to be caught up and placed
in shelters. After five or six days we caught one of the Owls with a
Sparrow-net, but the other eluded capture, and was finally shot whilst
devouring a Turkey belonging to a neighbouring farmer.
But to return to our Parrots, I was now left with only one, so I made
a special visit to Chapman's, and found that he had three just landed
from Brazil. I secured them at a reasonable pjice, and thought at
the time that I was buying P. chiripepe , but on visiting the Zoo I found
they had a pair of the same birds there labelled P. vittata. On inquiry
at the British Museum, I found that the principal difference between the
two species is that P. vittata has much more red upon the tail and lower
back than P. chiripepe. This difference can be best seen when the birds
are in the hand, as in flight they look exactly alike. On getting the
birds home, I gave them their liberty in an aviary where the wire

netting was in good condition. One of them died, as did also the Azara,
but the other two took possession of a nest-box, in which they regularly
roosted at night. About the middle of July I missed the hen, and on
looking into the nest-box found her sitting on five eggs, and on the 24th
four young ones were hatched. Both parents fed them, and they
grew fairly fast; but there was little sign of feathering until they were
nearly a month old, then the white around the eye began to show,
and a week later their heads were feathered and wings well grown, but
it was not until 13th September that the first youngster left the nest.
It was exactly like its parents, and active and strong on the wing.
Three others left the nest in due course, all very nice birds. From the
first they nibbled away at apples, of which they are very fond, although
both parents fed them for a week or two after they left the nesting-box,
to which, by the way, they regularly retreat at nightfall. These little
Conures are charming little birds and as playful as monkeys, but I
can quite imagine that they would do some mischief in a sparsely
planted aviary. I believe that this is the first time that this species
has been bred in captivity.
[Can any member quote a previous record of the breeding of this
Conure ?--Ex&gt;.]
A TAME RED-VENTED PARROT
By P. Kingsford Venner
I am the owner of a charming little Red-vented Parrot.
I believe these little birds are somewhat rarely imported. " Baby,"
as I call her, is exceedingly tame, quite the tamest bird, with the
exception of my Leadbeater Cockatoo, which I possess. I purchased
her last winter fronr Manchester, being informed that she was a " Blue
Mountain Lory". She arrived on a damp, unpleasant December
evening, but at once made herself at home, and although packed
after the manner of chicken in a rough box, with no covering beyond
several strips of wood nailed over the top, she. was none the worse
for her journey. I saw at once that the only resemblance to a " Blue
Mountain " was her head, and at once had a vague idea of her species,
which was confirmed when I looked up the Red-vented Parrot in Butlet's

P. Kingsford Venner--A Tame Bed-vented Parrot 133
Foreign Birds . She soon learnt her name--which I gave her on account
of her small size (not much more than half that of an Amazon)--and
says it in a small husky voice. She also has a sweet little cooing note
like that of a Dove, and a pretty whistle. She had been taught the
inevitable " Polly " before I had her, and says that in two totally
different tones, one the small husky one, the other a clear little
voice like that of a small child. The latter is only used as a request to
come out of her cage, which she loves doing, and she generally prefixes
it with " pretty I notice that Butler states that the Bed-vented
Parrot is " a hateful screamer ". This, as far as " Baby " is concerned,
I deny. She indeed has a funny little cry, something like " Kike-
Kike " or " Keek ", which she utters when she sees any strange object,
but this is not to me unbearable at all, like, for instance, the ear-
piercing note of the Lorikeets, etc.
She sometimes carries on long conversations with herself in a husky
" sotto voce ". What she says then, I don't know. She adores coming
on one's shoulder, and will frequently fly thither when loose. I have
had her in the garden, but she is not a very good homer w unless one
happens to walk under the tree or bush in which she is, when she will
fly suddenly down on one's head or shoulder. I feed her on sunflower
seed, oats, monkey-nuts, etc., fruit, which she loves, and green food,
including cooked vegetables, and sometimes a little bread and milk.
She is very friendly with other Parrots, etc., and quite fearless. She
frequenty used to enter the cage of a Bosy-breasted Cockatoo I possessed
if the door was open for a moment, and the two were on very good terms,
although the " Galah " resented her at first. She also, if I put her in
my aviary when she is too importunate, has great games with my Bed-
collared Lorrikeet. But she cries loudly if I leave her there long,
liking human society better than feathered. I may mention that I call
Baby " her " because, judging from Butler's remarks, the red under
" her " tail is hardly dark enough for a cock bird, being a bright rosy
red, with no tinge of crimson (to me). I have already somewhat bored
you, I am afraid, but since you also require notes on the Lories (not
Australian) I may add that I have a splendid " Purple Cap ", very tame,
who goes by the name of " Lucifer," partly from his gorgeous crimson-
scarlet red and partly from -his disposition, which, as far as other birds

are concerned, is not very amiable. I have had him for nearly a year,
and feed him on oranges, bananas and any other fruit, and sweetened
bread and milk, sometimes a little moistened cake (especially " sponge "}*
I have seen that milk sop is injurious for some Parrots, but Seth-
Smith believes in it for Lories. " Lucifer " has always been in grand
condition.
I have lately turned him into my big bird-room, as somehow I
dislike keeping even the Parrot tribe in cages. He has turned over a
new leaf here, and appears to be quite harmless. I watched him most
carefully at first. In conclusion, should you care for a few notes on
what I believe is the tamest and most affectionate Leadbeater--indeed,
I might say Cockatoo--in existence, I shall be happy to let you have
them.

CORRESPONDENCE
BIRD OF PREY VERSUS CARNIVOROUS MAMMAL WITH
" WARNING COLORATION "
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996246611111111" page_id="56188588"  page_num="134" year="" vol="">
Sir, --The account of the " Carancho " page 40, line 25, which was
evidently a southern Carrion Hawk known as Polyborus tharus, killing a
" crop-eared sharp-toothed animal ", line 23, found " partially eaten ",
is of special interest as evidence on the question whether a carnivorous-
toothed mammal, in which the coloration is conspicuous, and often
called " warning " by naturalists, can successfully beat off the attacks
of a formidable bird of prey.
The mammal was evidently a Grison, known scientifically as Galictis
.vittata. It is one of the musteline carnivora allied to Martens, Weasels,
etc., having a short, broad head, long body, short legs, and tapering
tail of moderate length. In behaviour they are fearless, and anyone
who has seen two Grisons fight each other can realize the mammal
would fight vigorously against a bird which attacked it !
The colour which makes it conspicuous to enemies is the fact that
upper parts, such as crown of head including the ears, back of neck,
and back are very pale and of a whitish grey ; whereas the under parts
are much darker, of a dark brown or blackish (this being the opposite
plan of coloration to that of many other mammals).

Now, while on the one hand the pale upper parts may act as a
" warning 55 to wild cats and foxes in S. America, not to attack a Grison
again after being once repulsed in a previous fight ; on the other hand,
the evidence on page 40 shows that such colour is no protection against
Carrion Hawks--which presumably have an advantage in being
able to descend in flight and attack the Grison in the back and adjacent
parts (which wild cats and foxes obviously cannot).
From what I remember of skins in Kensington Museum, seen some
years ago, Grisons range extensively over Brazil,- into Peru, etc., and
Central America ; so there is every reason to suppose that conflicts
between them and Carrion Hawks are not such rare occurrences as some
people think. Besides being called Huron in Argentina, I believe it
correct to say another name for the same mammal is Furao in Brazil.
The name Grison is founded on the grey colour above referred to.

A QUARREL BETWEEN GEESE--TWO VERSUS EIGHT
Sir, --On 1st April, when walking alongside the water in St. James 5
Park, London, I came upon a rather amusing quarrel.
Two South African Upland Geese, Chlosphaga magellanica, a male
and female, were walking about on the land close to the water&apos;s edge,
both angry and using their voices, and were keeping eight other Geese,
which were in the water swimming in a flock, from landing at that
particular spot, they being two Indian Bar headed Geese, Anser indica ,
and six European Bernicle Geese, Bernicla leucopsis. During the time
I watched them, the eight made attempts to land, but were always
repulsed out to water again by the South American pair, the latter
showing more vigour in the quarrel and being clearly more than a match
for their opponents, even though the latter were four times as numerous.
No signs of eggs could be seen, but the Uplands had presumably selected
the place for future breeding purposes. A working man, who was
watching them on my arrival, told me the conflict had been going on
for about a quarter of an hour.

By J. Delacour
In this chapter we have put together several families which have
no very close links with one another, but only few representatives of
which are imported, and the insectivorous diet of which is more or less
similar.
I. The Prionopidh:
These birds, although approaching fairly closely to the Shrikes,
form nevertheless a fairly distinct family. In external appearance
they rather resemble the Thrushes with their long legs, but their
beak is thicker. They are found especially in Oceania, but some genera
also inhabit Asia and Africa. They are insectivorous. One single
species appears to me to have been imported sometimes, and that is the
Australian Magpie Lark (Grallina picata) which indeed is of very
different aspect to the other Prionopidce. It is of the size of a Thrush,
but has a peculiar aspect with its long, black legs and very short toes.
Its beak is white ; the upper parts black with the wings and the tail
spotted with white ; the head is black with the forehead wide, eye-
brows, the cheeks, and the sides of the neck white ; the throat and the
breast are black, the remainder of the lower parts white. The female
is distinguished by its white mask and throat.

Aviculture
This bird is found in Australia, and it is common wherever there is
water. It lives on the high banks of the watercourses, like our Wagtails.
Its nest, in the form of a cup, is placed on the large horizontal stones
which rise above the water, and is made mainly of mud.
In captivity the Magpie Lark is hardy and is satisfied with the
Thrush's diet.
The Vangidce constitute an allied family very similar to the Shrikes ;
they are insectivorous. Their habitat is Madagascar and the adjoining
islands. None of them have been imported up to the present.
II. The Artamid^; or Wood Swallows
This family is very homogeneous, and is composed of curious birds
with a thick and moderately long beak, with very long and very
pointed wings reminding one of the Swallows, with short tail and legs.
They are found especially in Australia, but several species also inhabit
other parts of Oceania, the Indies, and Malasia ; one species is even
found in West Africa.
They are migratory birds ; they fly a little, like the Swallows, in
search of insects, but constantly return to their branch. They frequent
the wooded banks of watercourses and of tarns, and they nest in the
large forks of the trees and build cup-like nests. In addition to
insects they are also very fond of the nectar of flowers.
The Artamidce live perfectly well in an aviary on a good
insectivorous diet, and have even bred in England. The young are
only fed on living insects.
So far as I know, three Australian and one Indian species have
been imported, but these birds are nevertheless still rare in captivity.
The Swallow of the Woods, or Masked Wood Swallow (Artamus
personatus ), measures about 20 centimetres in length. The plumage
of the male is slaty-grey above, light grey below, with white at the
end of the tail, and a black mask bordered with white on the cheeks.
The female has a less distinct dark grey mask, and the lower part of
the body fawn-coloured.
The white eyebrowed Wood Swallow (A. superciliosus) is of
the same size. The male is dark grey above with black cheeks and a
wide white eyebrow, the throat and the breast dark grey; the lower

The Prionopidip , Artamidce, Waxwing S, Fireos ( Greenlets) 189
parts brown, the tail ending in white. The female is duller and has less
pronounced colours. This is the species which bred in Mr. Brook's
aviary in 1908, and has bred in the London Zoological Gardens.
The Dusky Wood Swallow (A. sordidus) is a little smaller. It is of
a dark brown with dark grey wings and tail marked with white.
These three species inhabit Australia.
The Brown Wood Swallow (A, fuscus) is met .with from India to
Southern China. It is of a dull grey above, with the head and the neck
lighter, the chin and the cheeks darker, and the tail tipped with white ;
the lower part of the body is of a vinous brown.
III. The Waxwings
These birds constitute the little family of the Ampelidce and are
met with in the North of Europe, of Asia, and especially of America ;
some species are found as far South as Central America. The Waxwings
are birds of heavy form and short and rounded beak, and the head
surmounted by a crest. Their tail and wings are often adorned with
brilliantly coloured patches. They are mainly berry-eating, but also
feed on insects. They seem rather erratic, especially the European
species which, during certain years, undertakes great migrations ; thus
from time to time we see them arriving in large numbers in the West
of Europe.
The Waxwings are very pretty birds, and their plumage is of a
remarkable silky appearance. They are very gentle in captivity, indeed
even slow and placid, and thrive on the diet of Thrushes, viz. paste
and fruit, soaked currants being very useful.
The European Waxwing (Ampelis garrulus) also called " Bohemian
Chatterer ", lives in the northern regions of the two hemispheres.
Its length is about twenty centimetres ; its plumage is of a silky grey
shaded with brown ; the forehead, a stripe passing across the eye, and
then rising to the top of the head, the chin and the throat are black,
with a white line under the eye ; the forehead and the cheeks are
tinted with russet; the head is adorned with a large vertical crest which
the bird lowers towards the nape of the neck at pleasure. The wings
are magnificently coloured, marked with black and white, and orna-
mented with yellow and red waxy patches. The tail is dark grey,

tipped with yellow, while the sub-caudal feathers are of a bright
brown.
The Cedar Waxwing (A, cedromm) is met with in North America
and as far South as Cuba and Jamaica. It resembles the foregoing
bird, only differing from it by its generally more yellow colour, its olive
yellow abdomen, and its less brilliantly marked wings. It is also
considerably smaller. It is a very popular bird in the United States ;
it is imported from time to time, and lives very well in captivity.
Two allied species have been imported exceptionally, viz. the
Phainopepla nitens from the south of the United States and from Mexico,
the male of which is entirely of a brilliant black with a long and tapering
crest and the tail and feet are longer than in the case of the Waxwings ;
and the Ptilogonys cinereus of Mexico, a fine bird without a crest, of
a bluish grey with a white forehead, the wings and the tail partly black,
the sides and the sub-caudal feathers yellow.
IY. The Yireonidje (G-reenlets)
The Yireos (Greenlets), although related to the Shrikes, in every
way resemble the Warblers and have similar habits. They are small
birds, all American, which are distinguished by their rather stronger
beak terminated by a more pronounced tooth, than that of the Warblers
and the Mniotiltidce. From the point of view of aviculture, they are
only of small interest because their plumage, although gracefully
variegated in grey, white, and olive yellow, is not very brilliant. So far
as we know, one single species has been imported into Europe, the Red-
eyed Greenlet ( Vireosylvia olivacea ) which is entirely of an olive green,
lighter below, with the top of the head of a slaty grey; an eyebrow,
a spot under the eye and the throat whitish, and a black line across the
eye, which is of ruby colour.
In captivity the Greenlets require the diet of the small insectivorous
birds.

<bodyText confidence="0.974230257142857" page_id="56188597"  page_num="141" year="" vol="">
Within the last few years several very fine birds have been
introduced to aviculture from Abyssinia, a country whose fauna was
little known but a few years ago. The French have been capturing
and importing birds from there somewhat freely, and it is to be hoped
they will not overdo it.
The Abyssinian Lovebird, unknown a few years ago, has now
become common, and the showy Superb Spreo now inhabits many
aviaries. More recently still, the lovely Royal Starling ( Cosmopsarus
regius) has been imported in small numbers, while last of all has come
a fine Touracou (Turacus donaldsoni), quite a number of which
appear to have reached Marseilles, from which a fair quantity have
drifted to London.
This Touracou was described by the late Dr. Rowdier Sharpe in
1895 and named after Dr. Donaldson Smith who first obtained specimens
in Western Somaliland. A good coloured figure by Iveulemans was
published in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society for 1895. It is
a very fine species hardly excelled in beauty by any of the genus,
which contains some of the most lovely and attractive of birds. Like
most of the genus its prevailing colours are grass-green and deep blue,
with carmine primary wing-feathers. The chief distinguishing features
are found in the coloration of the head. The rounded crest is of a
delicate pink at its extremity, while in front of the eye is a conspicuous
white spot and a white streak crosses each cheek. The bill and skin
round the eyes is bright red.
Touracous have never been common birds in captivity because they
were never imported in any numbers formerly; single examples
arrived, generally from the west coast of Africa, where the local species
is often known as the " Clock-bird ". Consequently, the breeding
of these birds in captivity has been a very rare event; but with the
arrival of a number of T. donaldsoni aviculturists have a very fine
species to experiment with. Its nesting habits appear to be unknown,
but there is little doubt that these do not differ from those of other
members of its genus which build an open nest of sticks like that of
a Pigeon, and lay some four or five w T hite eggs.

The Blue-winged Grass Parrakeet ( Neophema venusta) deserves
special care, both on account of its beauty and because it appears
to be on the verge of extinction. It has many peculiarities, ignorance
of which is likely to bring disaster. Like the two previously mentioned
species, it begins to do badly if kept in a fixed aviary for any length
of time. It is absolutely necessary to protect the top of its cage with
canvas and the top of its aviary flight with string netting, otherwise
sooner or later it will dart up against the wire in sudden alarm and
fracture its skull. During hot weather some branches should be laid
on the top of the aviary flight, as it is rather liable to sunstroke. To
prevent the birds biting the string netting in the aviary flight a smooth
board about twelve inches wide should be fixed immediately below
where the netting joins the sides. They have then no foothold, as
they are poor climbers. It is decidedly risky to attempt to winter
Blue-wings out of doors, and they are best brought in towards the end
of October and kept in large flight cages until the following May.
These cages must be really large, otherwise the hens will get too fat
during the winter and go wrong when laying their eggs. Blue-wings
do not seem to thrive flying loose in an indoor bird-room. Their
quarters must be kept scrupulously clean, as they get tuberculosis
and septicaemia on the slightest provocation. Pairs will not agree
together. Blue-wings are fond of green food, particularly groundsel.
The hen has a much less vivid blue frontal band, and the blue on her
wings is also less intense.
During the past few months there have been small importations
of three interesting species of Parrakeets which sometimes do not
reach this country for years together. None of them are altogether
easy to keep, and to prevent disappointment and loss for those who
may have bought them a few notes may be helpful.
The Rock Peplar Parrakeet (Polytelis melanura) seldom survives
more than a year or two unless kept in a large aviary with a grass
bottom, which is moved on to fresh ground every year. Managed in
this way they are no trouble at all, breed freely, and should live half

as long as their owner. Ordinary care needs to be taken to protect
them from chills when they first come over, but once through their
first moult they will stand almost any amount of cold and wet. They
should be fed on the usual seed mixture with plenty of fruit, a morsel
of sponge cake, and a few mealworms if they will eat them. The
male, after the first moult, gets a blue-black tail, and the female has
always a green one. Eock Peplars like a deep nest-box, the interior
being made climbable by wire netting tacked to the wood.
The Yellow-bellied Parrakeet (Platycercus flaviventris) also needs
a movable aviary with a grass bottom; kept in the usual type of
fixed aviary it is very subject to all manner of infectious diseases,
especially septicaemia and tuberculosis. It does not need artificial
heat, but must be induced or compelled to roost in a place well protected
from wind, wet, and draughts. In other respects it should be treated
like a Kosella : it is often fond of mealworms. The female has a much
smaller head and beak, but in plumage she resembles the male.

By James B. Housden
A suggestion has been made to me that I should write my experience
of an adventure that befel me in my search for the Mexican Wild
Turkey.
I would first say to any of our members who may have the pleasure
at any time of journeying in those beautiful mountains, " Do not
do as the writer did, venture into these lovely forests, even with
a guide, without first taking your bearings and providing yourself
with a good pocket-compass." Perhaps the writer felt a little too
self-confident.
I am copying from my journal sent home at the time, the entry being
headed " How I got lost in the Eocky Mountains of the Far West ".
Our ranch house stood in the southern part of our twenty-square-mile
ranch. We had staying with us for the benefit of his health an ex-officer
of the American Army, a Mr. McG--. I found him a very genial

James B. Housden --
companion; an archaeologist who knew the country well, he was also
a great help to me in the study of American birds ; he had taken me
long distances in our " Ford ", and I found him a very reliable driver
over those rough roads. He had taken me up one of the highest
peaks on the ranch to the graves of some Pawnee Indian chiefs ;
apparently no one ever visited these lonely graves of the Red men ;
years ago someone had opened one of these, and I brought away
some pieces of pottery I found lying near. Some beautiful birds
frequented this spot.
My friend suggested that we should go in search of the Mexican
Wild Turkey outside the ranch, locally known as Blackbeard.
From my bedroom window I had a very charming view. The
wonderfully clear atmosphere of the mountain plateau makes the hills
appear to be considerably nearer than is actually the case ; one range
visible from our house was, I was told, 250 miles away. While I was
at the ranch a forest fire broke out and our nearest neighbour was the
Forest Ranger at a distant town. I saw him call out the fire-fighters,
coloured and white, chiefly Mexicans ; this occurred in what is called
the black ranges, 70 miles away, but it certainly looked much nearer
the three days it was burning.
We arranged to have breakfast and start at daybreak. There
was a brilliant blue sky and already the sun was intensely hot. We
were soon outside the fence of the ranch : lovely and strange trees
and flowers--juniper, cherry, pinyon, cotton-wood (a lovely large
green tree), immense pines, real patriarchs of the forest--" live oaks ",
as these trees are called, green all the year round. There were also
many bright red and yellow cactus-trees. Some of the large pines
were dead, and had become the homes of bright and beautiful Wood-
peckers ; others had fallen, and lying prostrate for years had become
the abodes of vast swarms of red ants. On a distant mountain range
was the eyrie of a pair of White-headed Eagles.
We journeyed along, small flocks of Californian Quails racing along
the track in front of us, and other birds, which I believe were the
beautiful GambePs Partridge, flew across the ravine before we got
very near to them. We walked a long way, crossing canyons and
gulleys, and came to a very beautiful spot more open than most parts

Our Quest for the Mexican Wild Turkey and. how it ended 145
of the forest with a background of forest-clad mountains. Several
beautiful Hawks were flying about, and here we found our first traces
of the Wild Turkey. We walked along in Indian file for some time,
and found that the Turkeys had gone into the more jungly part of
the forest. My guide suggested that we should cover more ground
in looking for the nests, so we parted. Every few minutes he whistled
and I answered him ; we had both agreed to keep going straight
ahead. After a time I came to a very thick part of the jungle. I
tried for some time and found I could not get through ; I turned back
and tried to get through to him ; this was a fatal mistake. My guide
went on thinking I was through, while I went back along a ravine
and whistled but got no reply. I also put my hands up and coo-eed,
but there was no response. I then went along a canyon and hurried
on, but went from bad to worse in trying to find my way. I retraced
my steps and wandered on for a long time. It became intensely hot.
I coo-eed from time to time but no response came.
My nephew a few days before, in a very serious way, had said to
me : " Uncle, if it is ever your misfortune to get lost in these mountains
don't get panicky ; it is fatal for anyone to get into a panic ; stop, sit
down, and quietly think over the situation ; try to locate the sun,
or any of these mountain peaks behind our house." There were too
many trees to do this where I was. A week before I had visited, some
miles from our ranch, " Dead Man's Camp." Some years ago a white
traveller was murdered by Mexican bandits who took all his belongings,
and his body was found buried in the canyon. I had given up looking
for the Wild Turkeys, and was now anxious to find my way home.
I was parched with thirst and I must admit I became a little nervous.
The intense silence was surprising ; in this vast forest one could
almost hear the falling of a leaf. It required a very little stretch of
imagination to see a band of hostile Indians or Mexican bandits in
that lonely forest, and then I remembered that this was also the
home of two species of bears. On the ranch we knew of a large cougar,
while a pair of fierce timber wolves (the Lobo of the natives) had
killed a number of kids from the flocks of Angora goats. There were
also some coyotes, and a number of tiger cats had been trapped and
killed on the ranch.

I was quite unarmed, having only a walking-stick, and thinking of
all these animals made me hurry along and not rest. By this time I
began to feel very faint; it was a terribly hot day, my lips were cracked
and swollen, my tongue and throat parched. I searched about hoping
to find some spring, but was unsuccessful. All this long day I had no
food, neither did I feel hungry; only this great thirst. It certainly
was a very trying position for one to find himself in who had passed
the allotted span of life.
Time passed on, and as I did not return everyone got alarmed
on the ranch and search-parties were sent out. H., my cowboy friend,
made great efforts to find me ; he tracked me a long way along the
canyon and across the ravines, but lost the trail as I had returned part
of the way back. Mr. McG-- and others did the same ; unfortunately
for me, my nephew was away 200 miles from home, on the Bio Grande
River.
At times I felt I could not go any further, then I remembered I
had booked my passage four months before in the White Star ss.
Majestic and should soon be homeward bound with all my collection
of plants, etc. (no bird skins). This was an inspiration for me to keep
on under very trying circumstances.
While I rested on the mountain side (it was very steep) with one
foot on a fallen tree--I could not sit down as there were swarms of red
and black ants everywhere--I thought I caught the sound of the
tinkle of a goat or cow bell a long distance away. We have outside
our kitchen on the ranch a large bell hung between two trees, a very
loud-sounding bell. This is used to let the Mexican herdsmen know
the time for meals on the distant mountains. My niece could not go
out with the search-parties : she was the only one left at the ranch,
so thought she would keep the bell ringing, and I might perhaps hear
it. I found afterwards it was the ranch bell I heard.
I turned and walked in the direction of the sound. Afterwards
I came to a little cultivated patch. I said to myself, " Surely I have
reached civilization again " ; I found this was correct. Soon after-
wards I met an old coloured man ; he looked at me with mute astonish-
ment. I w&apos;as feeling very faint, covered with dust, and must have
looked like the Prodigal Son. He saw my plight and hurried to get

me a drink of water. I have been a water-drinker for a life-time, but
I think that mug of water, although quite hot, was the sweetest draught
of water I have ever tasted. I sometimes wonder if that old coloured
man realized what it meant to my parched tongue and throat. He
was most kind to me, and made me rest for some time. I got him to
understand I wanted Silsby's ranch ; he put up his hands, shook his
head, and made me understand I was going away from it.
As I knew everyone would be so anxious about me and I was eager
to get back, he went some distance with me and&apos;pointed out the way.
I left him with grateful thanks.
I found I had still a long way to go. I noticed a large number of
the beautiful Crowned Jays flying in front of me. I reached the top
of a very high hill, and fortunately for me my niece saw me painfully
straggling along.
Some time afterwards I woke from a deep sleep. I was covered
with dust, and found I was lying on the sofa at the ranch. I felt
devoutly thankful. I must have walked miles that day.
After a few days I was apparently little the worse for my unique
adventure. I may add the only Mexican Wild Turkeys I saw were
those in a still life 55 in the New York National Museum.

As far as weather was concerned, the season of 1924 was the worst
I can remember during the early part of the time, April and the
beginning of May being very cold and wet. No young birds dislike
cold rain more than ducklings, and none of these so much as Carolinas.
I lost the whole of my first hatch of Carolinas, some 25 in number,
between 25th April and 10th May. This was entirely due to cold
east winds, no sun, and much rain or drizzle. I am, in consequence,
going to erect some sort of garden frames before the hatching season
this year, with movable glass " lights Young Carolinas alone
should pay for the cost! Mandarins are very much hardier; than
Carolinas, and fortunately nest rather later, and losses were negligible.

148 Hugh Wormald--Duck Breeding Results, 1924, at Dereham
Fertility all through was very high, considerably better than usual,
due, I fancy, to the fact that the breeding birds were supplied with
meat meal during February, March, and April.
On the whole, last season was much the most successful I have
ever had. I obtained eggs from 26 species out of a possible 28, the
two species which failed to go to nest being Chestnut-breasted Teal
and Canvas-backed Ducks. The latter may not have been old enough
to breed, although last season was their second spring and the ten
birds were properly paired. They are still alive and I am likely to
get them to breed this year.
I suppose that I am the only person who has kept Chestnut-breasted
Teal without breeding them ! I have seen nests in friends' collections,
but have never seen an egg here. This species will, in all probability,
die out before long, as every bird in Europe to-day is descended from
a pair brought over from Australia in 1908 by Mr. Seth-Smith, and
unless somebody can import some fresh blood from Australia, I think
the race here is doomed. The breeding birds in this country now lay
a great number of infertile eggs, and nearly all the young birds which
are reared are ducks. A pair in the late Mr. E. S. Montagu's collection
laid three clutches of eggs last year and not one fertile, and Mr. St.
Q.uintin tells me that he had a large proportion of infertile eggs from
his birds. It seems a great pity that we cannot obtain some fresh
drakes from Australia, as this is a free-breeding Duck in confinement
(except here !). Perhaps the most interesting nest here last season
was that of the Common Scaup. This species has twice bred at Lilford,
but I believe nowhere else. But what made it interesting here was
the fact that both parents were not ten months old when they went
to nest. All the recognized works on Ducks tell us that Scaup do not
assume fully adult plumage or breed until their second year ! but the
birds were absolutely perfect by January, 1924, though hatched on
the 11th July, 1923, from eggs sent to me from Iceland. I showed them
to several first-class ornithologists, Mr. St. Quintin, the Hon. E. S.
Montagu, and Mr. Jim Vincent (watchman and head keeper at Hickling
Broad), and they all agreed that they were fully adult.
I fail to see how it is possible to tell the age of a nesting bird in
a wild state, and it seems to me that because good naturalists see

a certain number of obviously immature non-breeding birds in May,
June, and July, they immediately assume that no birds of that species
either assume their full dress or breed until they are two years' old.
I think it is quite probable that a great number of Scaup do not breed
until their second year, but I am perfectly certain that still more do
so. I reared several last season both from eggs laid here and from
eggs sent to me from Iceland, and several of these drakes are, in plumage,
indistinguishable from my old drake when on the water, the only part
they have not moulted clean out from their juvenile plumage being
on the belly, and these feathers will be moulted a pure white by the
end of February, and the birds in full adult plumage and, I hope,
will breed, in May.
While on the subject of Scaup it may be of interest to note that
they share with Red-crested Pochards a habit that I have never seen
in any other Duck. Just before the female goes to nest the male
continually makes short rushes at her from behind with open bill,
though he never actually touches her, and when one sees a Scaup or
Red-crested Pochard drake doing this you may be certain that the
duck will lay within a week.
I imported a pair of Lesser Scaup from Canada which arrived
together with some Blue-winged and Green-winged Teal about
Christmas, 1923. These birds I had hand-reared for me in Canada
in the summer of 1923, and here again the " books " caused me to
make a bad error !
I read that the Lesser Scaup does not breed until the second year,
and it so happened that there was an unattached American Wigeon 9
on the pond, and I noticed in April that the Lesser Scaup drake was
making advances to her, but believing that his own duck would not
lay until this year, if then, I took no steps to prevent the drake mating
with the American Wigeon 9 if he wanted to. Imagine my disgust
when it became clear about the middle of May that the Lesser Scaup 9
was going to nest (for the first time in this country !). I caught up the
American Wigeon 9 in the hope that the Lesser Scaup &lt;$ would turn
to his own 9 &gt; but he took no notice of her, and in a few days she had
begun to lay ! I never saw any drake take the least notice of her,
but on principle set her eight eggs, and to my astonishment two proved

fertile, duly hatched, and grew up to be a pair of hybrids between
the Common Scaup and the Lesser Scaup 9 " and this while the
Common Scaup's own duck was daily laying fertile eggs to him !
This pair of hybrids are now in M. J. Delacour's collection, and are
about intermediate between the two species.
In December, 1922, I imported some Redheads and Canvas-backs
from Canada. The latter, as stated above, did not breed, but from
two Redhead ducks mated to one drake I got 49 eggs last spring,
most of which hatched and were reared. I believe this to be the first
time this species has bred in this country. These ducks were parasitical,
and laid in Yellowbills', Pochards', Mallards', and other Ducks' nests,
and Mr. John C. Phillips, the author of a magnificent work on the
Ducks of the world, of which three volumes have now been published,
tells me that they are parasitical in a wild state. I should like to
draw my readers' attention to Mr. Phillips' book, the letterpress of
which is quite excellent, with very good information on birds in confine-
ment, and is far and away the most comprehensive work yet published
on this most interesting family of birds.
Roth the Blue-winged and Green-winged Teal imported with the
Lesser Scaup nested and the young were reared, the Green-winged
Teal being the first to be reared in this country as far as I can find out.
(In any case I am not eligible for a medal as all my Ducks' eggs are
hatched and reared under Bantams or Hens.)
The following is a list of the species which laid eggs here last

from Iceland. These three little Harlequins would look at nothing
in the food line at first, until I thought of live ants' " eggs " floated in
shallow trays, when two of them began to feed well, and looked like
doing, but one suddenly went off-colour and died, the other--a drake--
grew up and to my lasting regret was killed by a stoat in October !
I sent three of the Barrow's Golden-eyes to M. Delacour, but by
some mistake on the part of the shipping agents they were delayed
three days and arrived dead, and unfortunately I lost the pair I kept
for myself in December.
Deferring again to the age at which Ducks go to nest, I know that
some naturalists will say that one cannot judge by the behaviour
of birds in confinement. Against which I maintain that it is quite
impossible to tell the age accurately of birds in a wild state. Fitness
and consequently the desire to breed seems to be largely a matter of
food, and I can hardly believe that a Scaup reared artificially and
kept almost entirely on corn--an unnatural diet--will be fitter and
more advanced than a wild bird. Especially as it appears very unlikely
that a wild Scaup can ever go hungry, seeing that he is a sea-living
Duck, at any rate up till the breeding season, and he has only got to
dive to find an unlimited supply of small shell-fish, mussels, and other
food, besides what he finds on the " muds " at low tide.
I have myself seen immature plumaged wild Wigeon and Shovelers
in May and June which were obviously not breeding, but it would be
absurd to say that because I have seen these neither Wigeon nor
Shovelers breed their first year ! and yet when one sees wild, full
plumaged Scaup breeding it seems that the authorities assume that
these birds must be second or third year birds, whereas in all probability
a large portion of them are only ten months' old, though I willingly
grant that the drakes one sees in patchy " half-plumage " in May do
not breed that year.

tame, and fed so greedily from the hand that, if allowed as many small
fish as they would take, they were apt to die of surfeit. They drank
sea water, and if deprived of this, eventually perished of thirst, as they
would not touch fresh water once they had tasted it and knew what
it was.
Failure to provide sea water to drink may perhaps account for the
almost universal failure which people experience in their attempts to
keep alive Auks, Petrels, and other purely marine birds which are
occasionally picked up exhausted inland in unexpected places. When
sea water is unobtainable, Tidman's Sea Salt dissolved in fresh water
in the right proportion might be tried. It is unlikely that ordinary
salt and water would be beneficial to the birds, as sea salt is, of course,
different in its chemical composition from common salt.

The Lesser Whttethroat (Sylvia curruca)
This species is much smaller than the Common Whitethroat,
and it lacks the chestnut browm edges to the wing feathers. It is
of a mouse-grey all over the upper parts, the head being of a very
clear grey, the throat and breast nearly white, the outside tail feathers
partially ashy white, feet leaden grey.
Lesser Whitethroats arrive about the end of the third week in April,
or a short time after the Common Whitethroat has made its appearance.
The song is a bubbling number of notes more or less mixed up together,
but it always ends on a higher note which is somewhat sustained.
The nest is smaller and shallower than that of its bigger brother,
and is often built in a hedge, but occasionally down an old lane in
brambles. It is built of dead clover or goose grass and the interior is
lined with horsehair. There are often two broods in the year. The
eggs differ from those of the Common Whitethroat in having a whiter
ground colour, and being more or less spotted with grey and umber.

The young are much purer in their colours than the adults, and their
white breasts are flushed at the sides with a very pale delicate flesh
pink. The adults often bring their young when fully fledged into
gardens to feed on the ripe raspberries, of which they appear fond,
and many times I have seen the juice of this fruit on the side of their
beaks, like a naughty child that has been dipping into the jam-pot

The cage for this species should be the same as for the Willow
Warbler. Foods also the same, but this bird requires in addition
fruit and berries. It will eat elderberries, also red currants.
The Lesser Whitethroat is quite an easy bird to keep, and thrives
well in confinement and as a variety is interesting, this being its only
recommendation, as its singing powers are not great.
[To be continued.)
AN AFTERNOON AT FOXWARREN PARK
Some forty members of the Society accepted the kind invitation
of Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Ezra and spent a most enjoyable afternoon
at Foxwarren Park, near Cobham, on Saturday, 16th May. The
weather was ideal. Mr. Ezra had most kindly provided a char-a-banc
for the party and the drive from Hyde Park Corner was very enjoyable.
Foxwarren, so beautifully situated overlooking Wisley Common,
with the Surrey Downs and beyond in the distance, was reached about
3 o'clock, and a move was made through the gardens to the aviaries.
The situation of these is ideal, between two plantations of larch trees
on a sandy soil sheltered from all cold winds and bathed in sunshine.
They consist of a row of some nine compartments with warmed wooden
shelters opening into wire-netting flights. Beyond these flights are
other very large enclosures some 50 feet square planted with shrubs
and containing bathing pools and so forth. Each of these large flights
communicates with three of the smaller ones, so that the occupants
of any one of the aviaries can, by merely opening a door, be allowed
access to one of these huge enclosures.
All of the birds were in excellent condition, while many species
were nesting. Violet Tanagers had made a beautiful nest in a bush,

while Superb Spreos, Long-tailed Grassfinches, and many others were
either sitting on eggs or rearing young. The visitors were especially
charmed with three examples of the exquisite long-tailed Royal
Starling, a pair of Crowned Wood Partridges, Indian Redstart, Orange-
headed Ground Thrushes, Annam Tree Partridges, Cuban Doves,
and many other rarities.
The Parrakeet aviaries were next visited, and specially noteworthy
were a pair of Alexandrine Parrakeets of which the male is blue and
the female yellow. The blue male is perhaps the most wonderful
freak amongst Parrakeets that has ever been known. A very perfect
pair of Barraband Parrakeets were also much admired.
On returning towards the house a flock of Demoiselle Cranes,
accompanied by a solitary Crowned Crane, were met strolling about
the lawns and evidently very much at home. After a sumptuous
tea had been done full justice to, the visitors inspected the flower-
gardens with their ornamental pools and fountains and many rare
plants and shrubs ; some of the party paid a visit to the farm with
its herd of Jerseys, its Llamas and Shetland Ponies, while others were
shown a large area of woodland and open heather-covered ground
that is being fenced in as a home for such interesting creatures as
Emus, Kangaroos, and the smaller Antelopes.
It was after 8 o'clock when the party reached London, all feeling
very grateful to their host and hostess for their kindness.

TWO RARE LOVEBIRDS FROM TANGANYIKA

Living examples of two very rare species of Lovebirds, never before
imported alive to Europe, have recently passed through London
en route for the U.S.A., and it is as well that a record of this event
should be kept.
Mr. Painter, of Cleveland, Ohio, is a very enthusiastic aviculturist
as well as a great traveller and big game hunter. He has recently
made a trip through East Africa, and on to Cairo via the Nile. At
&amp; place called Nagara Nagara in Tanganyika Colony, at an altitude of
</bodyText>

some 6,000 feet, he obtained several birds, amongst which were two
species of Lovebirds, of which a number were secured. A journey of
one thousand miles by motor-car and another two thousand miles by
river steamer while confined in travelling-boxes greatly reduced their
numbers, and four only of the Lovebirds reached London. I am
indebted to Mr. Painter for the privilege of seeing and identifying
these.
There were three examples of the Masked Lovebird ( Agapornis
per sonata), the most characteristic features of which are its blackish-
brown face and conspicuous band or collar of yellow surrounding the
hind neck and throat. The remainder of the coloration is as follows :--
Upper parts, pale olive-brownish; upper breast, reddish-orange ;
back and wings, green ; under parts, paler green ; upper tail-coverts,
pale ultra marine-blue ; middle tail-feathers, green, the others orange
at the base, green in the middle, then a black band and yellowish
tip ; smaller under wing-coverts, green ; the greater ones grey-blue ;
iris, brown ; bill, coral-red ; naked skin round the eye and cere, white.
Of Fischer's Lovebird (Agapornis fischeri) there was but one example.
It is something like the Bosy-faced Lovebird, though perhaps more
beautiful. The following description is abbreviated from the British
Museum Catalogue :--Forehead, cheeks, and throat orange-red, darker
on the forehead, paler on the throat where it becomes rose-colour ;
top of the head, dull olive tinged with reddish on the occiput; a band
of reddish-yellow on the hind neck ; the throat margined with yellowish
underneath ; back and wings, green ; the body underneath, pale
green ; upper tail-coverts, blue ; central tail-feathers green with the
tip pale blue ; outer tail-feathers red at the base, green in the middle,
and pale blue at the tip, and with a black band on the inner web before
the blue tip ; small under wing-coverts, green, the greater ones grey-
blue ; bill, coral-red ; feet, grey ; naked skin round the eyes and
cere, white.
Both of these species were described and figured by Dr. Eeichenow
in 1887 in the Journal fur Ornithologie, but very few skins exist in any
museums.

PEREGRINE LAYING EGGS IN CONFINEMENT

Sir, --I should be interested to know if you have noted any records
of the Peregrine Falcon having laid eggs in captivity, as I have pleasure
in informing you that my specimen has recently laid three eggs for
the first time. She must be now about 10 or 12 years old. I have
have also a Buzzard that has laid from time to time, but I do not
consider this so worthy of record.
H. Lovibond.
[The Editor hears that the bird has since laid five more eggs. He
believes that there are other records of the Peregrine laying in captivity.
Can anyone supply details ?]

DRINKING HABITS OF THE PAINTED FINCH

<bodyText confidence="0.9834683" page_id="56188612"  page_num="156" year="" vol="">
Sir, --How does the Painted Finch (Emblema pieta ) drink ?
The late Dr. Russ pointed out that the Diamond &amp;quot;Finch, a near
relative of the Painted Finch, unlike most other Finches, does not tilt
its head backwards in order to swallow each mouthful of water, but
sucks up the liquid after the manner of a Dove.
In my Foreign Finches in Captivity I confirmed this statement,
and added that I had seen the Green Amaduvade do the same thing.
Has any member of our Society who has kept the Painted Finch
noticed whether it also drinks in this fashion ?
Arthur G. Butler.
A TALKING BUDGERIGAR
It is well known that a Budgerigar, if kept by itself with only human
companions, soon becomes tame and makes a very charming pet,
while such birds will occasionally learn to articulate words and even
sentences quite plainly. The following letter on this subject, which
was sent to the Zoological Society, will interest our members.
Sir, --I believe the following lines will interest you. I have a
Green cock Budgerigar which I have had for two years last Christmas.
When I first had him he was very wild indeed, so, after a few months,
I bought him a mate but she only lived about three months. Now

I have been told that they must be kept in pairs, but this one has been
much happier since being alone. Now comes the interesting part.
I have a boot shop and this bird is in with us : his cage has always been
left open, so the only time he spends in it is night-time. One day about
eighteen months ago I held a glass of beer to him. He took some
and now looks for it everyday ; since he has had just those few drops
everyday he has never had a minute's illness and his plumage is always
in good condition. I have read in books that it is possible to teach
these birds to talk if taken from the nest early. Well, this one talks
as plain as any human being, and he was adult when obtained. We
have always called him by the name " Joey ", so you can guess we
were surprised to hear him say " Joey " about eighteen months ago.
Since then he has picked up quite a lot of words. We have not spent
hours teaching him words as one does a Parrot, but have just spoken
to him as one would to a child, and he has learnt that way. The
following are some of the sentences he says quite plainly :--" Joey
loves his master " ; " Where's Joey's Beer " ; " He's just bit his
master " ; " Is Joe a pretty boy ? Yes, course he is " ; " I'll kill
you, you little devil " ; " Mabel (my wife&apos;s name) come here, I want
you " ; " Poor Joey's tired " ; " Kiss Joe " ; " Joey Cole, Earl's
Court." That's just a few, so as you can see he can pronounce
practically every letter. He is now beginning to understand, when
we ask him anything, to know what to answer us. Now, as regards
food, he eats and drinks anything, always sits by my saucer when I
have my first cup of tea and waits for me to give him some ; the same
thing at breakfast time. At midday, if I forget to give him anything,
he shouts out " Where's Joe's Beer ? " and he always helps himself to
a little. He won't eat fruit, except oranges, which he is very fond of,
also flowering grass.

Two Starlings have a nest with young close to where the disturbance

We have received from Messrs. Longmans, Green &amp; Co. the first
copy (price 16s.) of a new four-volume book on British Birds by
Archibald Thorburn. Twenty years ago a well-illustrated book on
British Birds, portable and reasonable in price, was a thing unknown.
Recently, however, more than one quite useful book of this kind has
made its appearance, but there is little doubt that Mr. Thorburn's
work, when complete, will prove decidedly the best. The first volume
deals with the smaller perching birds--Finches, Warblers, Tits,
Wagtails, etc. The letterpress is thoroughly up to date, and no rare
straggler on the British list is omitted, nor any subspecies that energetic
" splitters " have been able to differentiate from the type. The
numerous coloured plates are, it is almost needless to say, beautiful,
and many rare birds are figured as well as all that are well known.
A severe critic might consider the figure of the Hawfinch and cock
Chaffinch as not entirely satisfactory, but most of the plates reveal
that absolute perfection which we are accustomed to associate with
all Mr. Thorburn's work.

THE REV. C. D. FARRAR'S REMINISCENCES
The older members of the Avicultural Society will remember the
many very interesting articles, often flavoured with a strong taste
of genuine Yorkshire humour, that appeared in the Magazine
in the " good old days " some time before the War, from the pen
of the Rev. C. D. Farrar. We used to much enjoy those articles,
although the successes in breeding rare birds therein described often
made some of us green with envy ; and the Magazine, for several
years past, has been the poorer for their absence. We are very
glad to hear that Mr. Farrar still occupies the Vicarage of Micklefield,
though whether the famous aviaries are now tenanted we do not know,
but at any rate from the Vicarage has emerged a very entertaining
4s well as instructive book recording the many successes with rare
birds, that have been achieved there. We are not sure when it was
published but a copy has been sent to us and its perusal has given us
very much pleasure ; we are quite sure that our members will thank
us for bringing it to their notice. It is called Through a Bird-Room
Window , and is published at 6s. net by F. V. White &amp; Co., Ltd.,

The Council and members of the Avicultural Society are much
indebted to the Marquess of Tavistock for having edited the Magazine
during the past eighteen months. Lord Tavistock now finds that
with his time greatly occupied in philanthropic work he cannot
devote the necessary leisure to the Avicultural Magazine and has
reluctantly decided that he must resign the post of Editor. The
Committee have therefore prevailed upon Mr. Seth-Smith to under-
take the editorship once more, commencing with the present number.
Mr. Seth-Smith is a very busy man, and he hopes that members
will give him every assistance in their power by supplying " copy".
There are many members who keep birds, some extensively, who
never record the many interesting events that happen in their
aviaries, and we appeal to these for notes on any subject that would
be likely to interest our members.
Some of our members are very generously defraying the cost of
some of the coloured plates; Mr. Astley, Mr. Ezra, M. Delacour,
Miss Crosse, and Captain Stokes have each either given or promised
one, and it has been suggested that other members might be willing
to do likewise. The cost of good coloured plates varies according to
the number of different colours in the subject, but from #20 to #25
for the drawing and reproduction of a coloured plate is about the
figure.
Members need hardly be reminded that more members are
urgently needed, and we would ask every member to try and obtain
one or more new members.

PITTAS, CHATTERERS, TYRANTS, ETC.
By J. Delacour
Several of these families are somewhat uninteresting from the
avicultural point of view, as they are so seldom imported alive ; others,
however, include many strange and magnificent birds, such as Pittas,
Chatterers, Manakins, and Broadbills, and the wonderful Australian
Lyre-bird is amongst them.
I have been able to make observations on a good many of these
birds, as much on captive birds I have kept as on wild birds in their
American or Asiatic haunts.
A. The Pittas
The Pittas form a compact family, somewhat resembling the
Thrushes, with long thin legs and very short tails. Almost all of
them have very bright colours ; sometimes the sexes resemble one
another, sometimes they are different.
Pittas are insectivorous and live on the ground or in low bushes ;
they are very difficult to see, and build covered nests on the ground.
They are migratory, but few go beyond tropical countries. They are
found in India, Indo-China, China, and Japan, most of the East Indian
and South Sea Islands, Australia, and one species only occurs in Africa.
In captivity Pittas need the same food as other insectivorous
birds ; they are difficult to feed, but their weak point is their feet,

which are inclined to get sore, and they often die of it; it is therefore
necessary to give them soft, clean, and slightly damp ground, made of
dead leaves or other soft material, and to watch the state of their feet.
They stay all day on the ground, or on a log or stone which should
be provided ; they roost only for the night.
The Blue-winged Pitta (Pitta cyanoptera) has seldom been imported.
It is a fine bird, the size of a Missel Thrush, which inhabits Indo-China,
South China, and Borneo. I met with it in Annam, and Dr. Cogneveq,
Governor of Cochin-China, keeps in an aviary at Saigon a very good
specimen, which he feeds mostly on earthworms. Head, brown with
black sides and white throat; upper part, green ; wings and tail,
silky blue ; chest and flanks, buff; belly and under tail-coverts,
crimson.
The Bengal Pitta ( Pitta brachyura ) from India is the commonest
species .in captivity. It resembles the above, but is smaller and less
bright; it also differs in having a black band on the crown and
occiput, and less crimson underneath.
The Noisy Pitta ( Pitta strepitans) from Australia and New Guinea
is imported at intervals. It differs from the above mostly in having
the sides of the head and neck, nape, throat, and upper back black.
Pitta novce-hiberniw has once been imported.
The Hooded Pitta (Pitta cucullatus) comes sometimes from the
Himalayas, Burma, Annam, or the Malay Peninsula. It is a
bright green bird, with blue shoulders and tail, with a chestnut hood
on the head, surrounded by black on the throat and sides of the head ;
under tail-coverts crimson.
The Rainbow Pitta (Pitta iris) from North Australia is rather
similar, but has the head, breast, and under parts entirely black, save
for a chestnut crescent on the nape. It has lived in the London Zoo.
The Blue-tailed Pitta (Eucichla cyanura) from Java has been
imported in 1919, and was the property of Mr. H. Astley ; it differs
from the above species in having a longer tail, although this is still
very short. The head is black above and on the cheeks, with pale
yellow eyebrows and throat; a black and blue band across the chest;
under parts with dark blue and yellow stripes ; back, reddish-brown ;
wings, black and white ; tail, blue.

B- The Chatterers
Chatterers include birds varying from the size of a Goldfinch to
that of a Baven. They vary a good deal in aspect as well as size,
but most of them have a rather short bill and large gape, short wings
and tails. They are almost entirely frugivorous, although taking
insects as well. They all inhabit Central and South America, living
in the tropical jungle, always in the trees, and often on the tree-tops ;
they are rather timid and avoid human presence. Some of them,
such as the Cock-of-the-rock and the Blue Chatterers, are amongst
the most beautiful birds in the world. Their voice is generally very
strange and powerful, and while staying in Guiana I often heard the
astounding calls of the Lathria and Bell-birds ; no other bird's voice
can give an idea of their, strength ; they can be heard two or three
miles away ; others, such as the Calvifrons, imitate the bellow of a
bull or, like the Attila, never cease to utter a monotonous enervating
song. Chatterers are difficult to accustom to captivity and, with the
exception of Bell-birds, arrive in Europe on exceptional occasions
only. They should be kept in large cages or indoor aviaries at least
from October to May, and be given plenty of fruit, grapes especialty,
insectile mixture, raisins and dry figs, boiled rice and potatoes, etc.
They are very quiet and rather dull, but the lovely plumage of some
of them and the extraordinary voice of others make them very
desirable cage birds.
The Cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola rupicola) is a wonderful bird of
a big size, with a short tail, the colour of which is brilliant orange red
save for the brown wings and tail; a big crest on the head, curved
towards the beak. It is found on the rocky banks of streams in
inaccessible parts of Venezuela, Guiana, and Amazonia. Other species
inhabit Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. This bird vanishes as settle-
ment encroaches. A few specimens have been kept in captivity
in Mr. Pauvel's collection in Belgium and in the London and New
York Zoological Gardens. They are delicate and need good fruit,
especially grapes ad lib.
The typical Chatterers belong to the genus Cotinga, and are among
the most magnificent birds that exist: of the size of a Thrush, they are
of a bright blue, metallic and silky above ; wings and tail, black ;

according to species, the under parts have more or less extensive reddish
violet marks. The Banded Chatterer (C. cincta) from South-Eastern
Brazil, and the Blue Chatterer (C. cayana) from Guiana and Amazonia,
have been imported ; they do well on the ordinary Tanagers' food.
The Pompadour Chatterer (Xipholena punicea) from Guiana has
been brought to New York by Mr. W. Beebe ; it is a near relation
to the above genus ; it has a curious white and wine-coloured dress.
Pyroderus scutatus , a bird the size of a Crow, black with red throat
and foreneck, has been imported from Brazil.
The Umbrella-bird ( Cephalopterus ornatus) is another large bird,
all black, with curious crest in shape of an umbrella over the beak,
and a large feathered wattle hanging from the neck. It has once been
imported to England. It is found in many parts of tropical America,
but is scarce everywhere.
The Bell-birds (Chasmorhynchus) are oftener imported than any
other Chatterers ; the size of a big Thrush, they live well in confinement
on fruit and insectivorous and other mixtures. All the four species
have reached Europe.
The Naked-throated Bell-bird (C. nudicollis) is sometimes on dealers'
price-lists, and comes from Brazil. The male is all white, with a pale
green naked throat; the female, greenish-brown.
The Snowy Bell-bird (C. nevius ) from Guiana resembles the
preceding species, but possesses a long, curved, and thin wattle above
the bill.
The Pied Bell-bird ( G. variegcitus ) from Trinidad, Venezuela, and
Guiana differs from the above in having a brown head and black
wings ; its naked throat is covered with small caruncles.
The Costa Bica Bell-bird ( C . tricarunculatus) is the strangest of
all ; it is a brown chestnut bird, with white head and breast; three
long and narrow caruncles, in shape of spines, rise from the front
and under the eyes.
Bell-birds are remarkable in uttering a resounding call, which
reminds one of the noise of a hammer striking an anvil; they call in
captivity.
We shall only mention the Manakins ( Pipridce ), small tropical
American birds related to the Chatterers and having most of their

habits. They are commonly found in the low parts of the jungle ;
they generally have small bills and short tails, sometimes with pointed
feathers ; their colour is often very bright, being black with yellow,
red, or blue zones. I often watched several species in Venezuela and
Guiana. One only of the many I captured lived for several weeks
on fruit ( Manacus manacus).
We read in avicultural papers that Manakins have not been
uncommon in French aviaries in the old days, especially Pipra aureola,
Chiroxiphia pareola, and C. caudata, but since I have been keeping
birds I have never heard of any being kept in Europe.
C. The Tyrants
The Tyrants are very commonly and widely distributed all over
America, but they are much more numerous in tropical parts. They
vary in size from that of a Wren to that of a Shrike or Thrush ; many
resemble closely the Flycatchers, of which most of them have the
habits and diet, and are called by their name in America ; others
look rather like Thrushes or Wagtails, or even Larks. Many Tyrants
are very tame and inhabit gardens, villages, and even towns, roosting
on telegraph wires and roofs ; they are well known to all who have
crossed over the Atlantic, as they are very noisy and cannot escape
notice, even from the most casual visitor. All are insectivorous,
and are seen all the time catching their prey. They are most pugnacious
and plucky, and drive away even much stronger birds. Tyrants vary
greatly in aspect, according to their size and terrestrial or arborial
habits ; their bills are either short and small or long and broad, but
always rather flattened, with a strong hook and long bristles. Many
are plain grey or brown, and therefore not very attractive ; numerous
species, however, have almost the same dress, which is not without
elegance ; back, wings, and tail, brown or grey; under parts, yellow ;
throat, white ; head, dark brown or grey, with white eyebrows and a
red or yellow band on the top of the head ; the latter forms a sort
of crest, which is nearly always hidden when the bird is not in action.
But two groups of Tyrants are of exceptional beauty : the Vermilion
Flycatchers (Pyrocephalus) , whose heads and under parts are bright
scarlet in the male, and the Royal Flycatchers (Onychorhynchus ),

which has over the forehead a wonderful fanlike crest, red or yellow,
with a metallic blue border. But, so far, none of these lovely birds
have reached us alive.
Tyrants are little appreciated as cage or aviary birds owing to their
unattractive plumage and shape, and their voice is often disagreeable ;
the name of " Keskedee ", which comes from the French " Qu'est-ce
qu'il dit ", under which several species are known in their haunts,
gives a good idea of their call, which they utter unceasingly and to
a rather tiresome and sharp tune.
A dozen species have been imported and they do well on the ordinary
diet for insectivorous birds, but my own experience is that it is not so
easy to get them on artificial food when they have been caught up.
Tcenioptera nengeta has been brought from Brazil; it is a Wagtail-
like bird, ashy-grey with black and wdiite markings.
Machetornis rixosa, which is found from Venezuela to La Plata,
resemble the above species, but the ordinary colouring of many
Tyrants, brown above, yellow underneath, with the red band on the
crown.
The Elainea look like Flycatchers. I brought one from Martinique,
E. martinica, ashy grey, but of very pretty shape ; it had a pretty
song and was quite tame.
The Phoebe ( Sayornis phcehe) is a popular bird in the United States,
and also resembles a Flycatcher.
The Keskedees ( Pitcmgus ) are the most frequently imported
Tyrants ; very common in the gardens and streets of towns in Central
and South America, they are extremely noisy ; they are all brown
above, yellow below, with white throat and eyebrows, black head and
orange red crest; their bills are long and strong. P. sulphur atm
from Argentine, P. rufipennis from Central America, P. lictor from
Venezuela, Colombia, etc., and Megarhynchus pitanga, which differs
from the above by its larger bill, is found all over South America,
and is offered from time to time and does well in aviaries.
The true Tyrants (Tyrannus) have longer wings, but weaker and
shorter bills and feet.
The King-bird ( T . tyrannus) from North America is dark grey
above, light grey underneath, with a red crest. They are very
pugnacious.

The Southern King-bird (T. melancholicus) is greyish-brown
above, with a grey head and red crest, pale yellow underneath ; throat
and cheeks white. Both species are very tame and like gardens,
where they are seen all day catching insects in a Flycatcher's way
They have sometimes been brought to Europe.
A very pretty Tyrant ( Muscivora tyrannus) has been shown in the
London Zoo ; I have seen hundreds of them in the interior of Venezuela.
It is a lovely grey bird, white underneath, black head, and yellow
crest; but its beauty lies in its long, forked, black tail, which reminds
one of that of a Whydah.
D. The Oven-birds and Woodhewers
The Oven-birds are other American birds especially numerous
in the South. They are rather small, rufous red or brown ; some
are terrestrial, others arborial, and even living on the trunks of trees,
reminding either of Stonechats, Titmice, Tree-creepers, or Larks ;
their bill is generally long and weak, sometimes curved. All are
insectivorous. The most striking feature in these birds is the nest
of many species, built of clay and mud in the shape of an oven.
The only species which is sometimes imported is the Kufous Oven-bird
(Furnarius rufus), brown above, whitish below, with white throat
and belly ; it inhabits Argentine and does well in captivity on the
ordinary diet for insectivorous birds.
The Woodhewers ( Dendrocolajptidce ) form a closely related family
inhabiting the same parts ; they are larger birds, mostly brown and
resembling large Tree-creepers in habits, but, like Woodpeckers,
they tap the trees ; their bill is often very long and curved. None
have ever been kept in captivity; they would be difficult and
unattractive.
E. The Ant-birds
The Ant-birds (Formicariidce) form a large family of birds found
in Tropical America, like the preceding ones, including over 400 species ;
but on account of their insectivorous habits and dull plumage it is very
seldom that any of them are brought to us, and they remain little
known to aviculturists. They vary from the size of a Wren to that of a

Jay; many resemble Thrushes, Dippers, and Pittas ; they feed on insects.
I have often watched some species following an army of ants through
the South American jungle and catching the unfortunate insects
which had escaped their voracious enemies. Many Ant-birds live on
the ground or close to it.
Most Ant-birds have a brown dress, but many are prettily streaked
or marked with white, black, or rufous red ; others are long, their
tail and wings short. Only two species, we think, have been imported
alive : Grallaria varia , from Amazonia and Guiana, a big ground bird
reminding one somewhat of a Pitta ; olive-brown above, with grey
nape, feathers of the head edged with black, throat and chest chocolate-
brown, surrounded by white and pale rufous under parts; and
G. brevicauda, from South-Eastern Brazil, resembling the above,
but with a less short tail, olive-brown above, buff with black stripes
underneath, with a ruddy head and white spots near the eye. In
confinement they need the same care and food as Pittas.
F. The Lyre-bird
This is the place to speak of this wonderful Australian bird which,
although being decidedly of the Passerine order, resembles a gallinaceous
bird by its size, aspect, and habits. It is terrestrial, scratching among
the dead leaves to find its food. Among all its interesting points,
on which I cannot insist here, I shall only mention the wonderful
lyre-shaped tail which is spread when the bird is displaying, and the
extraordinary voice which enables its owner to imitate all noises,
songs, and whistles.
Unfortunately, this splendid bird has been on the verge of extinction;
very strict steps have been taken to protect it, and we hope they will
be efficient. In the past it has been sometimes shown in European
Zoos, in London and in Paris especially, where it used to live well.
Nowadays it is far too rare in Australia to be allowed to be trapped
and sent over to Europe.
G. The Broadbills
To close this chapter we shall only mention a small family of birds,
almost restricted to a dozen species, all remarkable by their strange

shape and lovely feathers : they are the Broadbills ( Euryloemidce ),
and are found in the tropical parts of Asia and the Malay Archipelago.
They are arboreal, living in damp forests, their purse-shaped nests
hanging from branches. Some are rather small, green, or ruby-
grey ( Psarisomus , Serilophus , Calyptomena) ; others are larger, black
variegated with white, yellow, red, etc. (. Eurylcema , Cory don, Cymbo-
rhynchus). I have often admired them in their tropical haunts, and
always dreamt of bringing some alive. Until now none have ever come,
but I suppose they could live in confinement on a proper diet of fruit
and insects.

THE BLUE-WINGED GOOSE OF ABYSSINIA

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.980601428571428" page_id="56188627"  page_num="169" year="" vol="">
By E. E. Blaauw, F.M.Z.S.
About two years ago I heard of the probable importation of Blue-
winged Geese from Abyssinia, and at once took measures to get my
share should the importation be successful. Blue-winged Geese have,
as far as I know, only been imported alive to Europe once before.
This was to Schonbrunn, for the zoological collection of the Emperor
of Austria just before the war, and they did not survive long.
When, in December, 1923, I got my lot of seven Blue-winged
Geese, I was never more disappointed, after great expectations, than
I was at the sight of the birds that walked out of their packing-cases.
They were in very bad plumage and general condition, and were
walking with their breasts carried forward and their heads resting
amongst the ruffled feathers of their backs. Besides, they were all
continually pecking at each other.
I put them in a warm bird-house and separated the greatest fighters
amongst the lot without being able, however, to produce friendship
or even peace amongst those that remained together. I fed them
on all sorts of grain, bread, greenstuff, and even chopped raw meat
and after months of the greatest care I apparently had saved the lives
of six of them, one surplus male having died.
Those six were three males and three females, and I daily expected

to see some improvement in the way they carried themselves, but in
this I was totally disappointed.
They were either sitting in a lump together, occasionally pecking
at each other, or they would walk about with their breasts carried
forward and their heads on their backs. Only on rare occasions they
would get excited and lift heads and necks and carry themselves like
ordinary Geese.
The males&apos;have a very melodious jwhistle~and the females a soft
and much lower note, and these can be distinguished from the males
by their smaller size. I kept the birds in the bird-house until last
spring, when&apos;I put them in an enclosure with a shed within it so that
they might be taken in at night during the first few weeks. Then,
as the warm weather came, which unfortunately was only with us during
a short time last summer, the birds began to moult, flight-feathers
and all, and are now in superb plumage. ^The moult and good con-
dition did not, however, change the way they carried themselves.
One day I had a surprise. I happened to pass their enclosure when
it was nearly dark, and there I saw my Geese^quite active--grazing,
carrying neck and head in an erect position, whistling to each other,
and in short doing everything that is expected of healthy Geese. I
thought I had, and still think I have now, the explanation of it all,
as I have since seen this thing over and over again.
This species of Goose, Ihave no doubt, is nocturnal, and only active,
therefore, during the night.
This, however, does not explain the very peculiar way these birds
have of carrying their heads and necks during the day-time. The head
not only rests on the back, but all the large wing-coverts which surround
the spot where the head lies are ruffled, and as they are curved and
more or less lengthened this makes them look all the more peculiar.
Although looking so huddled up, these birds are extremely agile if
there is need for it, as I experienced once when we had to catch them
to bring them to another enclosure. I know of no other species of
Goose that walks about in this position, and, if remarkable, it certainly
is not ornamental.
In other respects this Goose resembles in shape members of the
genus Bernicla or Chloephaga, The head is small and the bill com-

paratively quite as small and about the same shape as that of the
Upland Goose and the size is about that of the Ashy-headed Goose,
The shoulder feathers, which are white in members of the Ghloephaga
group, are of a delicate pale blue in our birds, and there is also a shining
green mirror on the wings.
* The general plumage is of a soft greyish-brown, with brighter
coloured tips at the end of the lengthened wing-coverts of the back
mentioned before.
There are light spots on the flanks, and the breast is also lighter.
Legs and feet and the bill are black. The birds might be attractive
if they were active during day-time. As they are they are certainly
interesting, but they are of the class which old Mr. Albert Jamrach
would no doubt have called scientific birds, this being his appellation
for birds which he could only sell on their claim of being either rare
or peculiar but not attractive.

Dr. 0. Heinroth of the Berlin Zoological Gardens is not only a very
experienced ornithologist but a most skilful aviculturist. With the
help of Frau Heinroth he has reared a number of delicate young birds
in his house, and he has had Nightjars nesting on the hearthrug in
his dining-room !
In the&apos;Journal fur Ornithologie for 1924 he gives a most interesting
account of the hand-rearing of a young Cariama cristata, of which we
append a translation of a part :--
" In the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London , September,
1912, D. Seth-Smith published a&apos;&amp;quot;communication on the subject of
the breeding and rearing of a Cariama by its parents in the Zoological
Gardens in London. Since, however, this account was very short,
my wife and I were delighted to have the opportunity of rearing a
Cariama in one of_our rooms, the pair in the Zoological Gardens in
Berlin havingjhad a second brood after losing the first. After an
incubation oUtwenty-five days, during the evening of 12th June,
1914, a young* bird came out in the incubator, the egg having been
entrusted to a common hen till the last moment. When newly hatched

the Cariama weighed 42 gr., its eyes were open, it lay still, but soon
raised its head and snatched at pieces of food which were offered to it.
At the same time it made a soft cheeping and, on taking hold of the
food, a hoarse rattling noise. Its beak w~as black, pink at the roots ;
its feet were also pink, the middle claw white and the others dark ;
the iris was grey. We could not detect any incipient quill-feathers.
At a superficial glance the down resembled that of the Night Heron
( Nycticorax ), at the same age, and also reminded us slightly of a newly
hatched Kite ( Milvus ). For the most part the down was brownish
yellow with light and dark shadings. On the second or third day
we noticed that the bird was not thriving ; it ate little and, as evacua-
tion seldom took place, the crop gradually became enormously
distended.
" On 16th June, at the age of four days, it died, and the gizzard was
found to be full of undigested food. The skin of this bird, a female,
was sent to the Zoological Museum in Berlin.
" On 18th July, 1914, another young Cariama was hatched after
twenty-six days' incubation. The egg had first been placed under
a hen and then given to a duck to hatch. The young bird weighed
45 gr. In contrast to its sister it had the navel well retracted and it
throve well; the rest of my observations refer to this bird. At the
beginning it always had one or two pieces of crushed meal-worms,
fresh ants'-eggs, a few cockroaches, spiders, and the like ; later it had
in addition raw heart with yolk of egg, pieces of lizard, mice, etc.
At first it lived in a Blackbird's nest, later in a nest made of a flat
basket and, during the first few days, artificially heated. In evacuation
the bird slid backwards, an instinctive action designed, of course,
to keep it clean. Probably the parent-birds then remove the droppings.
Of course it had no idea of the purpose of its action for, unless we took
care, it often immediately lay down upon its own droppings.
" This specimen, like the first, showed a falling-off in appetite and
well-being on the fourth day. It began to peck at the pupae of ants,
only to throw them away again. This suggested to us the idea of
offering it little stones and sand. Both were greedily swallowed and put
an end to the trouble. A close inspection of the nest which the parent-
birds had built on a shelf put there for that purpose showed that

there were sand and earth at the bottom. So it is possible that in
a state of freedom the young bird is in this way enabled from the
beginning to assimilate indigestible matter such as I have mentioned.
Young Herons do not eat these things.
" On the sixth day the eyes, which had increased in size, took on
a yellow tinge and the first quills appeared on the shoulders and the
wings, as well as amongst the down. As a rule, the bird sat upright,
resting on its hind claws, but it could not as yet stand. When it was
a week old we heard the first high, loud screeching notes, with which
we are familiar in the full grown birds. Moreover, it succeeded in its
earliest attempts at standing, supporting itself at first with its beak.
In sunshine and warmth the little fellow was very cheerful, hopped
about, flapped its wings and began to preen itself, but could not as
yet reach the vent, nor did it attempt to scratch. At ten days' old
it could stand well. For some time it had had the habit of picking
up anything thrown to it. The wing-feathers now emerged from
their sheaths.
" At twelve days old, on 30th July, our fosterling danced about,
flapping its wings and giving the true cry of the Cariama. At this time
it began to jump out of the nest, so that as a rule it spent its time
running about outside. 1 About six o'clock in the evening it used to
become restless and tried to get on to high objects. It gradually
began to take sand-baths. (The Cariama never bathes in water.)
"At three weeks old the first down was shed, to the weight of 6 or
7 gr. At this age the Cariama ate in a single day a bird as large as
a House-sparrow cut up in pieces, four lizards, some cockroaches,
15 gr. of fish and a piece of heart, putting on 20 gr. in weight. Every
evening, after having betaken itself about five o'clock to a high perch
for the night, it was put back in its basket, and at once settled down
to sleep.
" At four weeks old it sprang on to chairs and liked to go to sleep
on our shoulders. At such times it drew in its head but did not put
it under the feathers on its shoulders. When climbing it made use both

of its very sharp claws and of its beak. From this time on we took it
for a walk in the open air every morning, and it ran everywhere after
us, as though taking us for its parents. When it approached the Cranes
it answered their chattering with its own cry, but it was afraid of its
parents, uttered a note of alarm, and ran away. The parent birds,
however, took almost no notice of their offspring. It took about
90 gr. of food daily and gained 27 gr. in weight.
" At forty-three days old, on the 31st of August, it could spring on
to a shelf 90 cm. high. Some time previously the moulting of the small
feathers had set in ; the new feathers were darker than the old. This
new plumage was not merely a substitute for the old feathers but
the new feathers sprouted between them in the manner with which
we are familiar in other birds.
" When it was seven weeks old I was taking it for a walk one evening
near some high oaks when suddenly I lost sight of it. After a long
hunt I saw it on a large bough 5 m. high. It was nestling against
the trunk, having settled down to sleep. It had succeeded in climbing
up the rough and perfectly perpendicular tree trunk, for at this period
it could not fly. At this age its favourite food was first mice, then
lizards, then fish ; it would also eat grapes.
"At eight weeks old the bird could fly a distance of some metres
and to a height of 1 metre ; it could spring straight on to a table
and from there to a cupboard. When live snakes were put before it
it was terrified ; it hissed and retreated, but at a distance it made
with its beak the motion of throwing, with which it was wont to kill
live lizards by dashing them on the ground.
" When two months old the bird flew about 10 m. at a height of 1 m.
and was good at climbing trees. Its beak was black and its feet
red-brown in parts. Its mental capacities were small; in particular
\0x25A0we did not think that it could distinguish us from other people, for
it would follow anybody. We noticed the same fact in a Crested Quail
and a young Bustard. Often the most harmless things aroused its
mistrust. Once when an airship flew overhead the bird cowered
down in some bushes. It killed mice and the like without ado and
used the claw of its inner toe to help in tearing them to pieces. Once
some half-fledged birds hopped from a Finch's nest and fluttered on

to the ground, thereupon the Cariama seized and killed one of them
with the. speed of lightning before we could prevent it. It was very
fond of sand-baths and would lie comfortably, often with its wings
spread, in the sunshine. At six months old the moulting of the small
feathers had practically ceased. The bird spent the winter in a large
covered space, and in June of the following year was placed in an
outside cage in the Zoological Gardens and during the summer was sold
and sent to New York.
"The general impression which I received of the movement and
behaviour of the young Cariama is that it does not resemble those
groups of birds with which it is generally classed : young Cranes,
Bustards, and Birds of Prey behave quite differently. Unfortunately,
I am not acquainted with the development of the Sun Bittern, the
Trumpeter, and the Kagu. The most striking feature of the Cariama
is that it is not pre-eminently a bird which remains in the nest, nor does
it show a marked tendency to leave it. The young bird sits in the nest
for a short time but soon leaves it, although not fully fledged. Possibly,
as I hinted earlier, this behaviour is due to a primitive instinct of
its kind."

By D. Seth-Smith, F.Z.S.
The nuptial display of the male bird to its mate as the nesting
season approaches is one of the most beautiful spectacles in nature,
especially when nature has provided special highly ornamental plumes
for this purpose. In nearly all species of birds some degree of display
by the male takes place, although in a few species it is the female
that does the courting and who is specially decorated for the purpose,
such cases, however, being few in number. The Birds of Paradise and
the Pheasants may be cited as outstanding examples of excessive
development of the plumage of the males in order to enable them
to perform a startling effect before their consorts. This special
development of the plumage takes very varied forms, such as
lengthened plumes of special texture and often brilliant colours,
growing from the flanks, chest, nape, head, tail, or wings, and the

176 D. Seth-Smith--The Argus Pheasant and its Display
method of display is designed so as to bring these ornamentations
into special prominence.
That the display is of the utmost importance to the existence of
a species is evident from the fact that such over-development of the
plumage is provided for the purpose of the nuptial display and this
alone, for at all times other than during the display the excessive
development of wings, tail or flank-feathers is an actual incumbrance
to the bird, rendering flight and concealment far more difficult for the
males than for their unencumbered mates. With polygamous birds
the fact that the males are less well protected from the natural enemies
of the species than are the females is of no detriment to the species
as a whole, since the female is the most valuable sex and must be more
carefully protected ; and so we generally find her protectively coloured
and with no hindrance to her rapid flight from danger. The
extravagant ornamentation of the male is therefore simply and solely to
enable him to perform a brilliant display to the opposite sex, often
at the expense of his own safety.
In the Pheasants there are several species in which the males
are specially decorated for the purpose of the display, but perhaps
the two outstanding examples of this are the Peacock and the Argus
Pheasant, the former with the upper tail-coverts enormously produced
and. decorated, and the latter with the secondary wing-feathers extended
to twice the length of the primaries, of great width and elaborately
decorated. The method of display of the Peacock is too well known
to need further reference, but that of the Argus Pheasant is rarely
witnessed and some notes thereon may not be out of place.
When in its normal attitude with wings closed the Argus Pheasant-
gives the impression of a plain brown bird with a very long tail, a close
inspection showing that the plumage is minutely- spotted and
vermiculated with buff or cream-colour. The head is bare of feathers
except for a tuft of short black feathers on the crown and some hair-
like feathers, grey in colour, along the nape, the skin of the head being
blue. The bird is well camouflaged, except when it opens its wings.
The great beauty of the Argus Pheasant lies in the wing feathers,
both primaries and secondaries. The secondaries are of great length
and breadth, and are decorated throughout their length with a series

of large spots or ocelli, drawn with mathematical precision and shaded,
as by a skilled artist, so as to represent balls revolving within their
sockets. The primary feathers, which are of no abnormal length,
are also of great beauty, the shafts being blue and the webs spotted
with dark brown shaded with rufous on a cream-coloured ground,
while on the inner w T eb is inlaid a band of rufous minutely spotted
with white and giving the appearance of a separate feather.
William Beebe is probably the only white man who has seen the
Argus Pheasant display in its wild state, but this phenomenon was
observed in captivity a long time ago, both by the late A. D. Bartlett
and T. W. Wood, the latter being not only a very good observer but
also a skilful artist. He made a drawing of the bird in display, which
is a most clever piece of work considering the difficulty of the subject;
though it is not surprising that a detail such as the position of the head
in relation to the wing is not quite accurate.
I have seen the display on many occasions during the present
year as well as once in 1912. At its commencement the cock-bird
walks round the hen in a wide circle with bent neck and high steps
like a well-trained carriage-horse, at every step stamping loudly upon
the ground. He continues with narrowing circles and as he approaches
the hen-bird suddenly lowers the wing nearest her and performs a
lateral display as he rushes past her. This may occur several times,
but if she does not walk right away he will then face her and very
suddenly erect his wings into a huge screen held well in front of the body,
while the head is held behind one of the wings (Fig. 1). The
tail, with its long central feathers, is jerked forward and backward, the
long upper tail-coverts remaining erect. The comparatively short
primary feathers are pressed against the ground and the whole bird
sways gently backwards and forwards while a rustling sound is heard.
With the head held behind one of the wings, the question arises
as to how the bird contrives to see the hen, who is the supreme object
of his attentions. Bartlett believed that in order to do so he pushed
his head between the feathers of the wing and even went so far as to
state that the secondary feathers at one point became frayed in the
process 1 Darwin (Descent of Man) writes : " the bird, in order to see
the female before whom he is displaying himself, sometimes pushes

178 1). Seth-Smith--The Argus Pheasant and its Display
his head between two of the long wing feathers (as Mr. Bartlett has seen),
and then presents a grotesque appearance. This must be a frequent
habit with the bird in a state of Nature, for Mr. Bartlett and his son,
on examining some perfect skins sent from the East, found a place
between two of the feathers which was much frayed, as if the head
had here frequently been pushed through." Beebe, following Darwin,
who got his information from Bartlett, writes : " Naturally the bird
is rather anxious now and then to see what effect the display of his
beauties has upon the female, or if indeed she is still present; and to
accomplish this the head is poked through between two of the feathers,
either of the right or left wing, a momentary glance taken, and the
head withdrawn. Thus through the peep-hole in his living curtain the
feathered actor is able to keep watch upon his audience. In old males
shot toward the end of the breeding season, it is possible to locate
this peep-hole by the rather disturbed, frayed condition of the web
in its immediate vicinity. It seems to be confined to one side, each
individual Argus being either right or left-winged in this respect."
He goes on to say that he has seen this display a number of times
in captivity and once in the wild state, and this being so it is a pity
he did not observe it more carefully, when he would have seen that
the bird is able to watch the female during the whole time he is dis-
playing, not by the crude method suggested of poking his head between
the secondary wing-feathers, a process which I believe originated in
Bartlett's imagination, but by looking between the wings.
A glance at the photograph (Fig. 2) will show that in the position
in which the head is held it would be impossible for the bird to poke
its head between the secondaries : it could not reach that position.
Wood's drawing, published in the Descent of Man and in Tegatineier's
Pheasants , gives the impression that it could do so, but the position of the
head in relation to the secondary feathers in the drawing is inaccurate.
The two cock-birds at the Zoological Gardens are very tame and during
the display are wholly indifferent to the presence of human beings,
and I and Keeper MacDonald have on several occasions been able
to obtain a view of the displaying bird from directly in front, at a
distance of not more than 2 or 3 feet, when the eye of the bird,
peering through the opening formed by the angle of the wing, was

clearly visible. My friend., Mr. Neville Kingston, was successful in
obtaining a photograph which clearly shows this, and I am much
indebted to him for allowing me to reproduce it here. (Fig. 3.)
Regarding Beebe's statement that each individual Argus is either
right- or left-winged, in my paper published in the Proceedings of the
Zoological Society , 1925, Part 1, I stated that I had only seen the head
held behind the right wing. Since then I have seen the same bird
hold the head behind the left wing, and during a prolonged series of
displays he would use the right or left wing position as it suited him
best. Thus, if the hen were towards his left side he would obtain the
best view of her by holding the head behind the right wing and looking
through the opening with his left eye. If she were towards the right
side he would adopt the opposite position, and if directly in front
either side would serve his purpose. It has been frequently stated
that the hen bird appears to be quite indifferent to the advances of her
mate, and this is usually the case with most species, but in the case of
the Argus Pheasant I have noticed that as a rule the hen does appear
to be quite appreciative of what is going on. In fact, as a rule, unless
she advances towards him or stands still as he approaches, he will not
display ; and on several occasions I have noticed that as he displays
she walks up to him and appears to look directly into the centre of
the brilliant feathery screen in front of her. (Fig. 4.)

Mr. Astlev was born on 14th July, 1860 ; a cousin of the 21st Baron

Obituary
Educated at Eton, at Christ Church College, Oxford--of which he
was M.A.--and at Cuddeston Theological College, Mr. Astley was
ordained a clergyman of the Church of England in 1886 and held several
clerical appointments until 1899.
In 1895 he married Lady Sutton, widow of the late Sir Richard F.
Sutton, Bart., of Benham Park, Newbury, Berks, whose only son by
her first marriage. Captain Sir Richard V. Sutton, Bart., M.C., died of
pneumonia in hospital in France in November, 1918 ; he had served
in the war with great distinction and had twice been wounded.
Mr. Astley had one daughter, the Hon. Mrs. Humphrey Wyndham,
and one son, Captain Philip R. Astley, M.C., of the 1st Life Guards.
All those who were fortunate enough to know Mr. Astley have been
struck by his wonderful personality. He was a man of many activities :
religion, arts, travels, archaeology, natural history, and horticulture were
his principal occupations, and his knowledge of each was great.
Uncommonly gifted, he wrote and sketched charmingly and humorously.
In 1900 he produced a delightful book, My Birds in Freedom and
Captivity, a chef-d'oeuvre of keen observation, as well as of clever style,
which he illustrated himself.
Before all, Mr. Astley was a lover of birds and an aviculturist;
he kept pets near him from his earlier years, and as soon as circumstances
allowed, he gathered a large collection. At the same time he made
accurate observations and numerous sketches of wild and captive
birds, both at home and on the Continent, in North Africa and the
Canary Islands. Also he was as keen a protectionist as an aviculturist.
Artistic as he was Mr. Astley always arranged his cages, aviaries,
and enclosures with wonderful taste; everything with him was
picturesque and pretty, as well as practical and convenient. First
at Chequers Court, afterwards at Benham Park and at his Italian
Villa on the Lake of Como, at Varenna, and later on at Brinsop Court, he
kept numbers of rare and fine birds in lovely surroundings ; his cages
and aviaries, like his house and gardens, showed the mark of his most
original and tasteful mind. Fortunately, the Avicultural Magazine,
since 1895, has contained several accounts and views of his birds and
aviaries, so that future generations will be able to realize what a
clever naturalist and artist could do in our times. ... It is impossible

here to enumerate all the birds which have been kept for the first
time in Europe by Mr. Astley; there is hardly a family a species
of which he did not try to succeed in keeping. Among the
greatest rarities, we might mention Queen Alexandra's Parrakeets,
Fairy Blue-birds, Yellow-headed Gouldian Finches, Lidth's Jays,
several Niltavas, Pittas, Woodpeckers, Sunbirds, and Humming-birds,
while his collections of Waterfowl, Cranes, Flamingoes, Doves, Pigeons,
and Parrakeets were always among the best in the world.
In a coming number, we shall hope to give an account of his collec-
tion, as it was in May last, with coloured plates from his own drawings,
which Mrs. Astley's generosity enables us to print. His breeding
successes have been very numerous ; even last year a young Australian
Crane, several Queen Alexandra's Parrakeets, and numerous White-
breasted Doves, among others, were reared at Brinsop. He was the
first to breed Queen Alexandra's and Hooded Parrakeets, Rose-breasted
Grosbeaks, and Orange-headed Ground-Thrushes, and was awarded
medals for these.
In 1914, the Societe Nationale d'Acclimatation de France awarded
him its great silver medal for his successes in keeping and breeding
rare birds, and also for his work as contributor and editor to the
Avicultural Magazine.
Mr. Astley was first elected a member of the Council of the
Avicultural Society in 1895, and ever since was one of its main con-
tributors. He drew the design for its present cover in 1909, and took
up the editorship in 1912, keeping it until 1917. In spite of growing
difficulties, he managed to make the Magazine bright and lively to an
extraordinary degree. In 1921, he was elected President, and then
directed the Society with considerable ability and authority.
Mr. Astley was also a Fellow of the Zoological Society of London,
and a member of the British Ornithologists Union and of the Societe
Nationale d'Acclimatation de France. His knowledge of the French
and Italian languages enabled him to make many friends abroad, where
he was nearly as well known and appreciated as in England.
Besides his great merits as a naturalist and an artist, besides his
bright intelligence and intense activity, Mr. Astley had the kindest
heart, and was in the highest degree a perfect gentleman. His

Dr. Arthur G. Butler, who has been an active member of the
Avicultural Society since its foundation, more than thirty years ago,
died at his residence in Beckenham, Kent, on 28th May, at the age of
80. From early youth Arthur Gardiner Butler took a keen interest
in Natural History, his tastes at first tending towards entomology ;
and in 1863 he entered the service of the British Museum as
a systematic entomologist under Dr. J. E. Gray, and later under
Dr. Gunther. He was appointed Assistant Keeper in 1879, a
post which he held until his retirement in 1901. Of the large
amount of scientific work on insects carried out by Dr. Butler
we need say no more here, but the very excellent condition of the
collection at the present time is largely due to his work. He was
always a keen student of British birds and his scientific training fitted
him well for the thorough working of a hobby which during his appoint-
ment at the Museum he had little time to indulge in, that of the keeping
and studying of foreign birds, w T hich he took up whole-heartedly as
soon as he was able. The volumes of the Avicultural Magazine
from its commencement bear testimony to the scientific methods
adopted by A. G. Butler in aviculture and his books on the subject
have been of the greatest help to aviculturists. With old age he
allowed his collection to gradually decrease, and as his birds died off
at a ripe old age he did not replace them but contented himself with
another hobby, that of gardening, which was also dear to his heart.
But even at the age of 80 his interest in aviculture and the Avicultural
Magazine had not died out; for he wrote a letter to the June number
which he was not permitted to see in print, as he died two days before
it appeared. For many years Dr. Butler acted as Honorary Corre-
spondence Secretary, and the great help he gave the present writer
during a former and lengthy term of Editorship is gratefully
remembered. D. S-S.

A BUDGERIGAR FARM

<bodyText confidence="0.984017869565218" page_id="56188651"  page_num="183" year="" vol="">
Sir, --A friend of mine is considering starting a " Budgerigar
Farm ", and I am writing to ask you to be kind enough to answer a
few particulars.
Could you suggest an ideal outdoor aviary for, say, twenty-five
pairs, as a start ?
Also what would be, roughly, a good year's breeding ? Would a
mixture of canary and white millet, in equal parts, be sufficient diet,
with green food added ?
Any other suggestions you could make will be greatly appreciated.
Thos. L. S. Dooly.
[We hope soon to publish an account of a large breeding establish-
ment for Budgerigars in France, where many thousands are bred
annually.
For twenty-five pairs we would suggest an aviary of say four com-
partments, each to contain six or seven pairs and to have a covered
shelter and a flight, each of about 10 feet square and 8 feet or so in
height, so that the whole aviary would cover an area of 40 by 20 feet.
We have found that the addition of soaked bread is useful while young
are being fed, and plain canary seed is preferable to canary and millet.
Chickweed and flowering grass should be given ad lib.
In such an aviary, with the stock suggested, you might produce
from 150 to 200 birds in the season--with luck.
It is advisable to separate the sexes in the autumn.-- Ed.]

Sir, --As a member of the Avicultural Society, allow me to ask you
for information about the Lovebirds from Tanganyika, of which you
speak in the last number of the Magazine. Are the Masked Lovebirds
the same as the Agapornis nigrigenis (Black-cheeked Lovebirds) ?
When I read your colour description of the A. per sonata, and I compared
it with the description and the picture of the A. nigrigenis in the new
Neunzig, it seemed to me as if it was the same. But otherwise I cannot
believe it to be the same, as you say they have never before been
imported alive to Europe.

I would be very thankful if you would be so kind as to give me some
information concerning this misunderstanding, and I hope you will
not mind my asking you this.

[Although there is a certain amount of similarity in the colouring
of the two Lovebirds referred to in Dr. Luig's letter, they are quite
distinct. A good coloured figure of Agapornis nigrigenis appeared in
the Avicultural Magazine of October, 1908, and from this it will
be seen that only the cheeks are black, or blackish, the forehead and
crown being reddish brown and the throat orange. The species occurs
in Rhodesia, and was first discovered as recently as 1906. Agapornis
personata has practically the whole of the head black, which fades
away into a very distinct collar of yellow encircling the neck and
extending on to the chest. It inhabits the country surrounding the
Victoria Nyanza and Tanganyika. The coloured figures of A. personata
and A. fischeri in the Journal fur Ornithologie appeared in the volume
for 1889, not 1887, as stated in our last number. --Ed.]
MEALWORM BREEDING (p. 98)
Sir,--I n fairness to the author whose work I translated, I should
like to make clear that the translation begins on p. 99 (para. 2) with the
words " Of all the insects ..." and continues to the end of the
article (p. 102).
This is not quite obvious as printed, and I ought to have separated
my introductory half-page (as far as ". . . worth to me ") from the
remainder, the translation itself.

THE BREEDING OF THE BLACK-HEADED SIBIA

By Albert Sherriff

I am told that the above birds have never yet been bred in captivity;
so that an account of a pair that I have, which at the second attempt
have succeeded in rearing two young, may be of interest to members.
The cock has been in my possession for three years. I obtained
him out of a shipment of birds that had just arrived from India. The
hen had spent a considerable time in a London shop before I bought her.
Prior to the purchase of the hen the cock Sibia was very affectionate
towards a Brown-eared Bulbul and the two always roosted together,
and the Sibia was constantly caressing the Bulbul, which I should
imagine was a hen.
As soon as the hen Sibia was introduced into the aviary the cock
deserted his first love and the antics he performed were really ridiculous
to watch and were at the same time most interesting. I felt absolutely
assured that I had been fortunate enough to obtain a true pair. The
poor Bulbul suffered rather a bad time from the hen Sibia, as the latter
was on no account going to lose her new found mate.
As is known the sexes are very difficult to distinguish, though I
can always differentiate between my two birds as the hen is duller
than the cock and possibly less active. The former distinction may,
however, be due to the fact that the hen spent a considerable time in

a London shop, while the cock has lived in a large flight aviary since
his arrival in this country.
I had made up my mind to try and breed these birds, and so in
February of this year the two birds were turned out alone, with the
exception of a pair of Painted Quails, into a large flight aviary with
a heated shelter attached. The aviary had one particular advantage
which I believe partly accounted for the success in rearing the birds.
The height from the ground was 16 to 18 feet at the back, and was built
in the shape of a lean-to against a wall. Further, it is the warmest
place in the garden, and although it does not get the early morning
sun the wall has the effect of retaining a considerable heat from the
evening sun.
In early April the cock was seen to be carrying nesting material
which had been put into the aviary, and within a week the nest was
completed. In shape it was the ordinary open type, rather like that
of a Blackbird, but slightly smaller. It was made of hay and the
inner part was lined with dead leaves, hair, and fine grass. Strangely
enough the first time the nest was built only about 4 feet from the
ground in a bay-tree. The hen maintained complete apathy during
the time occupied by the building of the nest and for about ten days
afterwards, so much so in fact that I imagined the attempt to breed
the birds would end there.
However, one morning the gardener informed me that there was
one egg in the nest, and the next morning the hen was sitting on two.
Everything went well for a week until one morning on going to give
the birds their usual allowance of mealworms I discovered that the
cock was on the nest. When, however, the mealworms were thrown
into the cage he immediately jumped off the nest but I did not at that
time see any harm. In the evening, however, both birds were off
and apparently were taking no interest whatever in the nest. On
looking I discovered one egg, which was cracked and the second egg
had disappeared completely. I was very disappointed. I believe
that in his anxiety to obtain the mealworms the cock bird left the nest
carelessly and broke both eggs with his claws. I can see no other
reason which can possibly account for it.
I determined, however, to give them a further trial, and four or five

days afterwards the cock was again building ; this time high up in
a prunus-tree, about 10 feet above the level of the path, which tree
had got little in the nature of leaves on it as it was its first year in
that particular position. The hen on this occasion seemed to take
rather more interest in the nest, and I actually once saw her carry
a piece of hay up to the cock as though to suggest that he was getting
on very slowly with the nest, and she would often sit on a twig by the
nest while he was engaged in the building of it.
On the morning of the 19th May the hen was again sitting--*
presumably on two eggs, but owing to the height from the ground
it was impossible to see. The birds both sat very tight and allowed
anybody to approach right up to the aviary without getting disturbed.
As far as possible, however, nobody was allowed near. Fifteen days
after the young were hatched, as could be seen by the fact that the
older birds were carrying food to the nest. I was sorry that I could not
see the condition of the young at this time, but this was due to the height
of the nest from the ground, as mentioned before. Within four days
the young could be seen putting their heads up to receive food and at
that time appeared to be covered with grey down.
The parents were assiduous in the feeding, and to this end, were
kept well supplied with spiders, caterpillars, and mealworms. Green
and black fly were given them in large quantities and they appreciated
this very much, as could be seen by the way they licked them off the
leaves. The nest was apparently kept scrupulously clean and, as is
the case in a lot of young birds, the excreta is in the form of a pellicle,
and I often saw the hen take it out of the nest and, strangely enough,
carry it to the further end of the aviary before dropping it. When
mealworms were given the older birds immediately came down and
took them to the young and it was very interesting to note that in the
presence of a stranger the cock would always utter his warning note
if the young showed above the nest, and naturally they&apos;immediately
dropped down out of sight. The hen, however, was not so particular,
and would take worms to the young in full view of anyone, provided
they kept still. The cock strongly disapproved of this procedure.
On the seventeenth day after hatching the young left the nest. They
were fully fledged with the exception of the tail and crest. The former

is still quite short and the crest is not yet fully developed. There
is still a small amount of white round the gape.
Owing to the cold nights which we have had recently, I put both
the young birds in the shelter where the parents still tend them care-
fully. One seems to be slightly stronger than the other, but up till
now, which is a week since they have left the nest, both are doing
well.

By the Marquess of Tavistock
He came to me late in the autumn of 1923. He had lost most of
his toes, had a permanent injury to one eye, was very short of breath,
never stopped moulting, and had every mark of extreme age. Altogether
he was as scrubby an old crock of a Mealy Bosella as I ever set eyes
on. His mate, a much younger and finer bird, caught a chill and died
soon after her arrival, and as I did not much mind what happened to
the widower, who was obviously quite useless either for exhibition
or breeding, I turned him loose to take his chance in the garden. Why
he did not die a dozen times over during that long and severe winter
I cannot imagine. But frost and fog and bitter wind made not the
least impression upon him. Moreover, in spite of his age and infirmities,
it soon became apparent that his heart was still young and open to
the influence of female allurements. In my aviaries was an unmated
Brown's Parrakeet, and it was upon her that the Mealy set his affections.
Unfortunately, however, he had a rival--an old cock Brown's, too
aged to breed, who had been living for some years as a pensioner at
liberty. Although the Brown's was long past his prime he was still
a more vigorous bird than the Mealy, and more than a match for him
in a fight. Many were the battles that raged round the aviary. The
Mealy would fight the Brown's as long as he could, and even when
temporarily defeated he would dodge the victor round and round
the hen's abode until he flopped exhausted on the grass hardly able
to fly another yard. This went on for nearly nine months until I
happened to release a cock Pennant who had been confined all the

summer. Then the Mealy saw his opportunity. He made himself
most agreeable to the Pennant and showed him round the garden,
at the same time preserving a meek and deferential attitude towards
him. He even introduced him to the hen Brown's, and I fully believe
used to tell him that she was more than a little impressed with his
beauty and gallantry. But this was not all. While he appeared to
encourage the Pennant's interest in the hen Brown's he never lost
an opportunity of making bad blood between him and the cock. Over
and over again I saw him start a quarrel with the cock Brown's and
then retire to let the Pennant finish the fight for him. Very soon
the Pennant grew to detest the Brown's as cordially as did the Mealy
himself, and he went for him on every possible occasion. If the Brown's
had kept out of his way it would have been all right, but the sight of
the Pennant showing off to the lady he regarded as his mate was too
much for his discretion and he stood up to him over and over again,
only to get heavily punished by the big bird nearly twice his size and
still in the prime of life. Several times I interfered on the Brown's
behalf and tried to drive the Pennant away, but it was of no use ; as
soon as I was gone the Mealy enticed him back again. At last I saw
the Brown's get a bad bite and he flew off very weak and wobbly.
A day or two later he vanished altogether, and I have little doubt
that his enemies knew what became of him. The Mealy had got rid
of his original rival, but only, it seemed to me, by substituting another
more formidable one in his place. Would he resign himself to the
unsatisfactory role of playing gooseberry, or would he try and oust
the Pennant by main force and so share the fate of the Brown's. I
soon found, however, that I had under-estimated his intelligence.
The Pennant was certainly attracted by the hen Brown's, but he had
been many months in confinement and liberty had other delights
to offer besides the chance of sitting all day on the top of an aviary.
There were all sorts of delicious wild foods in remote parts of the
garden, and cosy sheltered corners when the wind was sweeping across
the lower field. So the Pennant was sometimes absent from the chief
centre of interest, but the Mealy watched the aviary as a cat watches
a mouse, and directly he saw he was alone he would fly down and pay
compliments to the Brown's and offer to feed her, with such success

that she soon came to prefer the more attentive suitor to the one who
was often absent. So before long the Pennant found that his visits
were received with cold indifference. The Mealy was as polite as ever,
though I fancy I caught the suggestion of a wink in the one eye that
he still had under proper control, but the Brown's simply ignored the
Pennant altogether. There are some birds that will continue to press
an unsuccessful suit on the most unresponsive female, but a cock
Broadtail is not one of them. Proud and hasty-tempered, he expects
his advances to be received by the lady of his choice with a proper
blend of appreciation and modesty. A too forward and saucy minx
he puts in her place in no uncertain fashion, while a hen who is
indifferent to him he simply has no further use for. So when the
Pennant found that his visits to the Brown's were no longer welcomed
he simply cleared off and took no more interest in her than he did in
the Barrabands next door. The diplomat had won. Ancient,
dishevelled, lame, and half blind though he be, he comes to the aviary
the Brown's accepted mate. The race is not always to the swift,

Miss R. G. Cross sends the following extracts from a letter she
has received from Mr. Wilfred Frost:--
" A paragraph in an ornithological periodical anent the Yellow
backed Lory (L. flavopalliatus) ' associating, as these birds are wont
to do, in flocks of large size ', leads me to make the following
observations :
" Lories never flock : I am speaking of all species ; they invariably
travel in pairs, or couples. Granted they may assemble at times in
crowds numbering many hundreds on a tree or trees to feed on blossoms
or fruit, but once settled it would take an exceptionally sharp eye,
even with the aid of field glasses, to detect a single specimen, and
anyway observation would show that they would all eventually
depart, as they arrived, in pairs, widely separated. Nearly twenty
years of watching, trapping, carrying, and caring for Lories of every

species yet introduced to Aviculture has enabled me to form a fairly
accurate and comprehensive idea of their little ways and temperaments.
" The bird to which you refer (L. flavopalliatus) was probably
purchased at Ternate, and no doubt originally from the adjoining
mainland of Halmaheira or Gilolo as indicated on old maps and charts.
The species L. Jiavopalliatus and L. garrulus occur also on Batchian,
and I have even met with a few stray specimens on the North Coast
of Obi; but the common name of Ceram Lory is a misnomer, the
species being absolutely unknown in a wild state in that island,
L. domicella, the Purple-capped Lory, being the common Lory of
Ceram, to which locality it is confined.
" As far as I can gather, the Yellow-backed Lory is as plentiful
on Batchian as on Halmaheira, but curiously enough I have never
yet met with a specimen in captivity there, whereas at Ternate (which
by the way is merely a more or less dormant volcano, with no resident
Lory of its own) the species may at any time be purchased in scores
from the Halmaheira natives, who come across the bay to meet the
ships, bringing canoeloads of White-crested Cockatoos, Tanygnathus,
Great-billed Parrots, Eclectus, Yellow-backed Lories, and immense
numbers of Violet-necked Lories.
" At present I have only two old friends that always accompany
me, a Chalcopsittacus insignis (Bed-quilled Lory) and a Chalcopsittacus
scintillatus (Yellow-streaked Lory). The former is the only one of
its species I have ever met with: it talks and acts, and is altogether
a wonderful chum ; the other is a trapped bird, and although tame
and docile enough now will never, I am afraid, sufficiently overcome
its initial timidity to become affectionate and accomplished in any way.
Still the two make very good company for each other, and incidentally
quite a fine contrast in colour effect."
Dr. E. Hopkinson, C.M.G., D.S.O., has just arrived in England
from the Gambia with several interesting birds, amongst which are
two beautiful Spreos, Spreo pulcker, one West African Golden Oriole,
Oriolus auratus, and one Blue-breasted Roller, Coracias cyanogaster.
We believe all three species to be ne^y to aviculture.

By J. Delacour and M. Legendre
The Woodpecker family contains a great many birds which inhabit,
according to their species, large forests, woods, or orchards. They
are spread all over the surface of the globe, with the exception of
Madagascar, Australia, and Polynesia.
These birds are very agile climbers and are distinguished by the
following characteristics : beak as long as the head, very massive,
straight, and shaped like a real working tool ; tongue slender and very
long, provided with small lateral hooks and constantly covered with
sticky saliva ; this tongue, thanks to a special apparatus, can be
swiftly projected for some way beyond the beak, and permits the bird
to pick up rapidly the insects hidden in galleries or under the bark
of wood. The tail consists of strong and slightly curved feathers ;
when the Woodpecker climbs these feathers are pressed against the
trunk of the tree and partly support the weight of the body. Tarsi
are extremely short and powerful; two toes are in front and two
behind ; they are provided with heavy claws, curved and sharp.
Woodpeckers live chiefly on insects, either in the perfect state or
as larvae ; many take fruit, nuts and walnuts in winter, and some even
store them up. The flight is undulating and generally short. They
are not great travellers, and breed and sleep in holes in trees which
they have often made themselves. The eggs, of which the number
varies according to the species, are more or less shining white. They
have no song ; their calls are not musical; they have a habit of
producing by rapidly repeated blows with their beaks, a kind of
drumming, which serves to drive out insects and also as a call, for by
imitating this noise it is very easy to call up Woodpeckers.
Every bird has a charm for the bird lover by qualities peculiar to
its kind ; some are kept on account of the beauty of their plumage,
some for their song, some for their pleasant natures. Woodpeckers
surely are prized for the harmonious and rich colouring of their plumage
and also for their tameness, which makes them, when domesticated,
as interesting as Parrots. They can be kept loose in a room, or on
a chain fastened to a perch, or in a cage.

Loose in a room they become very familiar. A Middle Woodpecker,
which we had thus kept for a long time, would always come to perch
on us, or, if he happened to be on the ground, would hop on to our
boots and climb up round and round our bodies. Arrived on our
shoulders our shirt-collar interested him, and he would amuse himself
by striking it with his beak. He would come when called by name,
hid his nuts in every corner, and put the cat to flight in order to steal
her food. Unfortunately, everything made of wood bore the marks
of his beak. In any case the tameness and amusing habits of these
birds are a great recommendation.
Many people, not feeling inclined to put up with the trouble and
damage of a Woodpecker at liberty, fasten it by a chain to a perch ;
treated in this way the bird is very amusing and will allow himself
to be caressed. The perch should be made of two fairly thick pieces
of wood with the bark on.
When caged Woodpeckers require a fairly large place strengthened
with metal. Branches fastened vertically are necessary for them
to climb, for without ceasing they climb to the end of a branch and then
fly to the ground and begin to climb again at once. If they are not
given branches they climb up and down the wire netting of their cage
and break their tails.
All the European kinds and a fairly large number of foreign ones
have been kept in captivity. The Green Woodpecker and the
Ashy Woodpecker are in my opinion the noisiest and perhaps
the wildest. The Little Woodpecker (small spotted) is the most delicate
on account of its chiefly insectivorous diet. Their food should consist
of insectile mixture, beech nuts, hazel nuts, and some seed ; insects,
and above all when in season, ants' nests. For the larger kinds a little
meat (bullock's heart) cut into wormlike pieces. They require a
shelter in which to pass the night.
Woodpeckers are arranged in numerous genera ; we will speak
first of the best known species of Western Europe.
The Black Woodpecker (Pious martins) is the largest European
Woodpecker (43 to 49 centimetres in length). The whole body is jet
black, but the crown of the head from forehead to occiput a fine crimson
red. It is chiefly found in the depths of large pine forests, where it

lives in pairs ; it nests in a very large cavity and lays three to five
eggs. In Europe it occurs as far as the Mediterranean, in Asia as far
as Japan ; it is found in the forests in the East of France. In 1910
while we lay hidden in one of the fine forests of the Vosges on the
look out for Capercalie, we had the pleasure of observing a pair
of this fine Woodpecker, and could easily realize how well it was suited
to its calm and majestic surroundings.
The Green Woodpecker (Gecinus viridis) has the upper portion
of the head, the occiput, and moustache bright red ; the upper parts
are a beautiful shade of green, the lower yellowish white, and the
rump greenish yellow. The hen has a black moustache and less red
on the head. This Woodpecker is sedentary and common ; it may
be seen in woods and parks shaded by large forest trees. It is more
often seen on the ground than the other kinds, popping about after
insects, especially ants and their eggs, of which it is particularly fond.
Its well-known, often repeated call is supposed by some to foretell
rain. It is found in Central Europe. A sub-species, Gecinus viridis
sharpei, inhabits Spain and Portugal.
The Ashy Woodpecker ( Gecinus canus ) differs from the above in
having yellowish green plumage ; the male has the forehead only
ornamented with crimson ; the female has no red on her head, which is
ashy. It has the same habits and pretty much the same habitat
as the Green Woodpecker, but is much rarer in Western Europe.
The Pied Woodpecker (Dendrocopus major) has lustrous black
plumage adorned with white, with the under parts dirty white. A
reddish-white band across the forehead, the occiput bright red, also
the lower belly and under the tail. The hen has no red on her head.
It has much the same habits as the Green Woodpecker, but is less
confiding, for at the least noise it clings motionless against a tree.
It is a native of Europe. Numerous sub-species replace it in Corsica,
in Great Britain (D. m. paroti and D. m. anglicus ), in the Canary Isles
(D. m. canariensis), in Russia, etc.
The Middle Woodpecker (Dendwcoptes medius) is often confounded
with the foregoing, but is smaller (21 to 22 centimetres against Pied
Woodpecker's 24 to 26 centimetres). Its plumage is likewise black
and white, but the sides are washed with pink. Both the male and

female have the top of the head and the nape ornamented with slender
feathers less vivid red than the Pied. It has the same habits and is
found in the same localities as the foregoing ; but is much rarer and
somewhat intermittent. It is found in Europe from South Sweden
to the Mediterranean. A sub-species (D. m. sancti-johannis). is found
in South-East Europe and Asia Minor.
The White-backed Woodpecker ( Dendrocopus leuconotus) has the
top of the head and nape red, back and rump white ; wings black ;
lower parts also white and rose-coloured sides. The moustache is
black and the lower belly red. The hen may be distinguished by her
black head. It has the same habits as the pied Woodpecker. It is
found in Central and Eastern Europe, and has been met with in France
(Jura to Pyrenees). There are sub-species in Northern Russia and
Siberia.
The Lesser Spotted Woodpecker (Dendrocopus minor ) is the size
of a Sparrow, and is the smallest European species. Its plumage
is also black spotted with white like that of the Pied Woodpecker,
but it has no red under the tail. The hen has no red on her head.
This little species lives in woods, shrubberies, and orchards. It is
not shy and often makes its nest near houses in the country ; it often
has to defend its hole against Tits and Tree Sparrows. Is found in
Middle Europe ; sub-species inhabit Russia and Asia.
The Three-toed Woodpecker ( Picoides tridactylus) is very different
from the other species. This bird has the top of the head a fine golden
yellow, the upper part of the body black and white, below white with
black streaks on the abdomen ; black moustache. The hen has no
yellow on her head. It inhabits Northern and Central Europe and
the mountains of the South (Alps and Jura in France). It is only
met with in large forests and its ways and behaviour is the same as those
of other Woodpeckers. There are several races of this species.
Of exotic Woodpeckers we chiefly receive American species ; but
some Indian ones at times.
A specimen of the Golden-naped Woodpecker (Chrysophlegma
flavinucha) has lived for the last six years in the late Mr. Astley's
possession. It is a fine large bird, having olive green wings and back,
with quills barred black and chestnut ; the head chestnut above,

white beneath, the nape adorned with a splendid golden crest; the
upper chest white, spotted black ; under parts grey ; tail black.
It is found in India and Indo-China.
The Yellow-backed Woodpecker (Brachypternus aurantius) from
Northern India is another large and magnificent species, which has
once been imported. It has the crown of its head and the crest red,
the back and a great part of the wings golden yellow ; the rest of the
plumage is black and white.
Colaples auratus from the Southern United States is a large bird
with grey plumage of different shades barred with black ; a red spot
on the nape ; face and throat vinous red.
Chloronerpes striatus from West Indies is of the usual type among
American Woodpeckers : the crown, nape, and rump red ; wings and
back barred greenish yellow and black ; tail black ; under parts tawny.
The Melanerpes make up a very numerous genus of American
Woodpeckers of medium size ; several species have been imported
and may occasionally be obtained from dealers. They do well in
captivity.
Melanerpes erythrocephalus from the United States is very hand-
some ; the head, neck, and breast of the male are bright red, the large
wing coverts and those of the tail and all the under parts white ; the
back, the wings proper, and the tail are black.
M. candidus from Central S. America is white with the back, wings,
and tail black ; a white line starts from the eye and reaches to the
upper part of the back.
M. flavifrons is very pretty indeed. The male has black wings
and tail; the back is white, spotted with black ; forehead and throat
yellow ; crown and nape red ; white breast, sides white, streaked
black ; the belly red ; the female has no red on her head. They are
natives of Southern Brazil and Paraguay.
M. superciliaris from Cuba is black, striped with white above ;
dun underneath, with crown, nape, and the middle of the belly red.
M. wagleri, M. aurifrons, and M. santacruzi only differ from the above
in point of size and in the arrangement of the red or yellow on the
crown of the head.

and black with a red spot on the nape. It has been imported from
Canada.
Celeus flavescens from Brazil is another large and beautiful Wood-
pecker, with head and large crest, back of the neck and the rump
golden yellow, marked with red on the cheeks ; the under parts and tail
are black ; the mantle is black spotted with yellow.
Campophilus principalis from the United States is a large black
Woodpecker, with stripes from the beak to the shoulder and part of
the wings white, and a red crest.
Before finishing we must mention the Picumnus ; tiny Woodpeckers
spread over America and Asia, of which one Brazilian species ( P .
cirrhatus) has been imported. It is about the size of a Wren, brown,
streaked tawny above ; white, with black spots underneath ; the front
of the crown red and the back black stippled with white.

In the classification of birds Wrynecks come immediately after
Woodpeckers. They have certain affinities with the latter, first in
having feet with two toes in front and two behind, secondly in their
extendable tongue, terminating in a dart. But this is all. The
Wryneck's straight, conical beak is the same as that of any other
insect-feeding bird, and its tail has not sufficient strength to be a useful
prop in climbing vertical branches. Unlike the Woodpeckers it does
not climb long or often ; but for all that it hangs on to the trunks
of trees and can remain a long time in a vertical position.
The Common Wryneck ( lynx torquilla) during its migration is
spread over a great part of Europe. In winter it may be seen in
Africa and through Asia to Japan. A sub-species (lynx t. tschusii)
differs from the type in being smaller and darker plumaged. Found
in Corsica, Sardinia, and Italy. The Wryneck is a very curious bird.
Its mysterious life and peculiar habits have always interested the
naturalist, and many legends are woven round it. It is a migratory
bird which returns every year to Europe, arriving a few days before
the Cuckoo. Eighteen centimetres long, its beautiful plumage recalls

in design and colouring that of certain night moths. Its plumage is
delicately stippled, striped, and streaked with cunning designs
harmonizing delicately on a ground which shades from grey into
chestnut, giving the illusion at a distance of a withered leaf or a particle
of bark. Thanks to this perfect mimicry the bird often remains
unseen. Therefore it is hard to know whether it is really abundant
or not very common.
The name of Wryneck has been given it because of its exceptional
power of twisting its head as though its neck were dislocated. Through
all time it has attracted attention by its strange faculty of imitating
a snake. In this way it goes through some really comic postures
but which certainly alarm a good many of its foes.
When irritated or alarmed it first makes a very sudden movement
and spreads its tail widely. Then it flattens itself, keeping its eyes
wide open and fixed and its feathers tightly depressed except those
on the head which stand on end ; next, with body bent forward, it
slowly moves its neck forward and then shoots it out with a sudden
movement while giving a little hiss like a snake. It does this several
times over. An adult captured bird very often goes through these
movements in confinement. Young ones taken from the nest, tamed
and used to confinement and people coming and going, only very
rarely assume this wonderful attitude of the wild birds. In a state of
nature danger and the instinct of self-defence develop faculties which
have no meaning in captivity.
This bird nests once a year in a hole in a tree, where it lays six to
eight pure white, very thin-shelled eggs. It lives on various insects--
caterpillars, chrysalids, and flies--but prefers ants' eggs to everything
else.
Few of our country's birds lead as solitary a life ; it emigrates
singly towards the beginning of September.
Wrynecks are birds which do well in confinement and are com-
paratively easy to rear. They are as contented among company
in aviaries as alone in a Blackbird's cage. They make, indeed, charming
pets which never trouble their fellow captives no matter how tiny.
They become very tame, and soon learn to take mealworms from
the hand. Without being dull they are not noisy, and often cling for

a long while to the wires, either resting or performing their toilet.
They like, too, to hop about on the ground, where with spread tail
they push their long tongues into every comer.
It is a large feeder ; it usually begins by thrusting its tongue into
its food vessel to pick out its favourite morsels (such as ants' eggs)
afterwards using its beak in normal fashion. It is in my mind that
I have once or twice seen a wet Wryneck, but I cannot be positive.
Certainly I have never seen them bathe ; but they drink a good deal.
An adult Wryneck when caught should be fed for the first few days
only on fresh ants' eggs and mealworms whose heads should be crushed
in order that they may not escape. Then little by little insectivorous
paste should be mixed with the ants' eggs and the mealworms, which
last should be cut up into small pieces. In this way the Wryneck
will get accustomed to eat the whole mixture, and it may be considered
completely acclimatized when ants' eggs are no longer indispensable.
The bird-keeper who desires tame and healthy birds will find
it best to take them from the nest and rear them by hand. Except
for singing birds, which do not reach the full perfection of their song
unless they have grown up in a state of nature, it is the only way to
have birds fittest for cage life. They are easily reared at any stage of
their growth, but I advise that they should be left until they are ready
to leave the nest, in this way they will not take so long to rear as they
will soon become independent of their owner's care.
If tame birds are desired Wrynecks are among the most suitable.
They should then be held in the hand while they are being fed, and
accustomed to come and perch on one's finger when called. Above all
they should be given mealworms only when in this position. Wrynecks
rarely appear in bird-lovers' collections, but they have all the qualities
desirable among aviary birds, song excepted ; they are peaceable,
gentle with their companions, and tame with their keepers. They
only need a very little heat in winter, do not require very special food,
and it is easy to rear them from the nest.
Here should be placed two families of birds from Tropical America,,
the Jacamars (Galbulidoe) and the Buccos (Bucconidce). They inhabit:
forests, where I have often observed them, the former on low branches,
or the telephone wires passing through thickets, the latter among the:

tree tops. They are purely insectivorous and nest in holes which they
dig in sloping banks. They have very small feet. The Jacamars
are splendid ; they are like Bee-eaters, but have stronger, straighter
beaks. Most of the species are golden green, silky and metallic,
really beautiful, and the under parts bright rust colour.
The Buccos are more thick set, have thicker and shorter beaks
strongly hooked at the end, and their colouring varies from brown
to grey, more or less marked with black, white, and red. In shape
they rather remind one of certain Barbets.
I caught several of these different birds in Guiana and Venezuela,
but could never accustom them to cage life. They have not yet reached
Europe alive.

The recent introduction to Aviculture of two new Glossy Starlings--
and strikingly handsome species too--in two consecutive years (1923,
1924) is a noteworthy event, especially as one of them has been bred.
Neunzig, in his invaluable work Die Fremdlandishe Stuhenvogel
(which is largely drawn on below), describes 15 species as having been
kept in captivity. Interest in these two new additions, together
with the timely arrival of the April Magazine and Mr. Seth-Smith's
full account of the Crystal Palace Show therein and its " fine class of
Glossy Starlings of ten entries " (p. 110), has led me to tabulate the
records of those species which have been imported and kept, as far
as I know them. The result, which follows, may interest others and
bring to light other species which ought also to be included. Our
Zoo, I feel pretty sure, has had others, of which I know nothing. The
total number I can now bring up to 19, or 20 or more if hurchelli is
separate and if sub-species are counted separately.

7. Green Glossy Starling (Lamprocolius chalybeus H. &amp; E.),
N.E. Africa and ( L. eh. hartlaubi Neum.) West Africa (Senegambia).
Nzig., p. 500.
Neunzig (under Chalybeus ) says : " One of the most commonly
imported Glossy Starlings. It first reached Europe (the Amsterdam
Zoo) in 1866, and in 1872 was bred at the London Zoo." Butler (AGB.,
ii, 36) confirms this. A more recent success (or possible success) is
referred to in Bird Notes (viii, 137), where the Editor, Mr. Page,
writes, " . . . Mr. Bush informs me that this species has bred freely in
his aviary and that he was surprised to find the nestling plumage
glossy ... We hope to give a detailed account in our next ..."
No such account appeared, so whether there was real success or not
must remain uncertain.
All accounts must almost certainly refer to the West African race
{hartlaubi), as they were very much more likely to be imported than
East African species ; at any rate this was the case at the date to which
these records refer, though nowadays we receive almost as many birds
from East as from West, at any rate as regards Starlings.
Hartlaubi is quite a common Gambian bird, the larger of our two
Green Starlings ; I have had live ones from time to time.
8. Green-winged Glossy Starling (Lamprocolius chloropterus Sw.).
Nzig. , p. 501.
This is another Common Gambia Starling, and if it, as I believe,
is the smaller of our two green birds, it is much the commoner species
here, but according to Neunzig " it is only rarely imported and that
usually for zoological collections only ".

This I take to be the larger and bluer of our three Gambian short-

ones, but resemble them in habits, except that perhaps they are rather
fonder of trees and less on the ground than these are. Neunzig does
not mention purpureus (unless under another name. Query : is it the
same as chalcurus, No. 9 here ? ), but according to Russ the species
was bred in the London Zoo, and Wiener says that young were hatched
there in 1871 and 1874. Butler (AGB., ii, 35), however, says that he
can find no record of the occurrence in the Proceedings. Wiener may

A truly splendid bird of West Africa (Senegal to Togo), which is
unfortunately becoming very rare owing mainly, I am afraid, " to
the bloody and unceasing pursuit of native skin-hunters, and unless
precautions are taken it will soon be extinct; it is no longer found in
Casamance, where formerly it was common, but in Fouta Jallon and
in Upper Guinea, where hunters are so far absent, it is to be met with
in largish parties. . . . They do badly in captivity. The selling price
of a skin is from 2 to 3&apos;50 fr."
This I quote from a most useful little work on the fauna of that
part of French West Africa near the Gambia, which appeared in 1906 ; 1
perhaps we may hope that the war, and the greater difficulty in obtaining
powder since, may have helped the bird against the man. It certainly
might appear to be the case in Gambia. I never saw one till last year,
when I saw three, and again this year a few more at the same place in
Niumi. Here apparently they have always been rare and only rainy
season visitors to our seaward end, Kombo and Niumi. They are
rather larger birds than the ordinary Green Starlings and, besides
a particularly brilliant gloss with coppery as well as blue or green
reflections in parts, their diagnostic character is a distinct bronzy
ear-patch.
According to Neunzig, the species was in the Amsterdam Zoo in
1863, and later at those at Berlin and Frankfort, being wintered out
of doors at the last place.

which are thriving and which I hope to get home. They live chiefly
on " white ant " and grasshoppers, which are easy to get in abundance
here, but have taken to bread and biscuit, chopped meat and cheese,
so ought to do. Like all Starlings they have become ridiculously tame
in a very short time. They and a Green one all escaped the other day.
The sight of the grasshopper tin and a few dead ones thrown into the
cage was enough to get them all three back again inside ten minutes,
and they are now in a larger cage with an almost fool-proof door.
Neunzig says, " rarely imported and only for Zoos."

17. Superb Spreo (Spreo superbus Biipp.).
A bird which merits its title just as much as does splendidus, perhaps
more so. An East African bird, which first appeared in England
in 1923, introduced by Mr. Ezra, who was also the first to breed them
in an outdoor aviary in the following year. By this time they had
become almost common and comparatively cheap, for a London dealer
imported at least one large consignment. They were also bred at the
Zoo and elsewhere in 1924. (See Avicultural Magazine, 1924, 168.)

A strikingly handsome, fairly long-tailed East African Starling,
whose introduction to aviculture (1924) is another of Mr. Ezra's many

reached his aviaries which, I hope, they still grace ; and there is a
pair, presented by him, at the London Zoo.

About 1919 Hamlyn imported some of the South African race,
and I think Gamage and others had some more later.

Sir, --To the number of Babblers mentioned as having been kept
in confinement in M. Delacour's interesting article in the April number
(p. 87) can be added two West African Crateropus : the Broad-tailed
Babbler, Crateropus platycercus, and Reinwardt's Babbler, C. rein-
wardti. Both are common Gambian birds. I have brought home the
first at least twice, one pair of which lived at the Zoo for years and
nested there, though I think without any eggs resulting, certainly no
young. One reinwardti (out of several I have had) also reached home.
They are among the easiest of Gambian birds to catch ; as soon as you
have got the first he (or she) will call others at once, and they do well
for the journey home on biscuit soaked in milk as a staple food, to
which they very soon take and seem to prefer to the more natural
diet, white ants and ripe bush fruit, which one can get so easily out
here, and which feeds practically any insect-eating bird one may get,
but which, of course, is not available for the journey.

fed on the diet of sunflower seed. Several died of fits when on other
diets, but I never lost a bird on account of this diet. Occasionally
the Ornate Lorikeet is given little tit-bits of fruit, cake, soft dry
bread, and raw scraped carrots, but always in very limited quantities.
She is in the acme of health and perfection of plumage. There never
was a tamer nor more affectionate little bird. She plays on the table
while I am writing.
My collection of Parrots, Lories, and Parrakeets numbers about
150 birds, including some of the rarest specimens. I have
2 Ceram Lories, 1 Purple-cap Lory, 3 Black-cap Lories, 2 Dusky
Lories, 3 Astoria Lories, 1 Cochin Lory. Last summer my Cochin
Lories laid, but the eggs were clear. The hen sat for about a month
and died two days after I took her eggs away, although she was
apparently in good health.
I have also 1 Great Palm Cockatoo and 3 Gangas, besides several
other Cockatoos.
In regard to their feeding, I wish to say that they are all fed alike
and are allowed all the clean water they wish to drink. The attendant
feeds them only upon sunflower seed, while they get tit-bits of fruit,
cake, etc., from me or the members of the family.
I do not keep any of my birds in cages, except the Love Birds and
Budgerigars ; I have 5 Bourkes, 2 pairs of Golden-shoulders, 1 pair
of Elegants, 1 pair of Many-coloured, and quite a number of other
Australian Parrakeets. These are all in separate aviaries. Last
December one pair of Golden-shoulders hatched two young, but they
died of the severe cold when about a week old ; they were in an outdoor
aviary. The two pairs of Golden-shoulders which I have are both
nesting now.
All the large Parrots and Conures are on stands which are portable
and are placed about in the garden during the summer. Here on
Long Island, New York, we cannot allow any bird full liberty, for they
always come to grief within a short time.
All my birds are exceedingly tame and love to be touched and
fondled. I have 2 Hyacinthine Macaws and 2 Glaucous Macaws
that play and roll on the ground with us and the dogs in perfect con-
fidence. I also have Keas which are exceedingly tame and very

THE NESTING OF RUSS'S WEAVER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993400259259259" page_id="56188684"  page_num="208" year="" vol="">
Sir,-- Last year, about the end of November, a pair of Russ Weavers
nested in my aviary. I had not discovered the fact until they had
laid and had been hatching for some time. As I found them most
interesting to watch, a few notes here may be found acceptable.
In a clump of twigs they selected from a number of old nests one
particular one, and to the entrance of it added a small narrow tube.
Not knowing anything of the nesting habits of these birds I at first
took no notice of this, but a few days later, by the strange behaviour
of the birds, it could clearly be seen that they were nesting.
Going up quietly to the nest I saw the hen slip out and fly to the
other end of the aviary.
On observing them more closely I found that the hen did most of
the incubation, the cock only taking his turn for a few minutes while
she left for food.
When flying to or from the nest she always uttered a loud squalking
noise, so that one could tell immediately she had left it. She had an
extraordinary way of puffing out her feathers like a clucking Hen,
and at the same time shuffling her wings up and down. All the time
during the incubation the cock guarded the nest, and should any other
bird come too close would immediately puff out his feathers in the
same manner as the hen and chase it off.
Unfortunately, just at about the time the eggs should have hatched
they were thrown out by another bird.
I examined the nest after they had left it, and found that it was
much more strongly woven than any of their other nests and that
there had been two eggs--blue in colour.

NOTES FROM RHODESIA

The following does not in any- way pretend to be a scientific study
of the bird-life of Rhodesia, but is rather a series of notes commenced
on leaving England and kept as a kind of ornithological diary during
a period of about eighteen months spent in the beautiful district by
the Umsururu River, about twenty or more miles from Salisbury,
where the writer stayed for health reasons.
One seldom hears of Rhodesia mentioned in connexion with matters
ornithological, the reason why I cannot tell: possibly it is because
it is a comparatively new country or on the other hand because there
are no ornithologists there. To my mind it is of surpassing interest
for the following reason : being situated about midway between the
Tropical and Temperate regions its avifauna consists of species from
both areas, making it particularly rich in bird-life.
The birds of Rhodesia, unlike the mammals, fortunately seem to
hold their own against the advance of white civilization. The farmers,
the majority of whom are well educated, in that respect differing
from most of their congeners at home and whose geniality and
hospitality make Rhodesia one of the most hospitable regions in the
world to live--seem to recognize what an essential economic factor
the bird-life is in keeping down the insect pests which destroy the
crops. This applies especially to the larger birds, excepting the birds
of prey, and there seems to be a sentimental feeling towards the smaller
ones. The great enemy of these latter is the small boy with the shot
gun, who kills for the sake of killing, making no discrimination.

Waxbills, Zosterops, Sunbirds, and Warblers, etc., fall alike, to be
picked up and thrown away. No doubt as they grow older they tire
of this disgusting sport, if it is sport, and recognize the birds as the
friends of mankind.
The natives, too, take a heavy toll of the bird life, robbing
systematically nests of young birds for the pot, and nothing seems to
come amiss to them, from Finches to Ostriches. Fat young nestlings
rank with flying ants, locusts, and hairy caterpillars as being the
" bon bouche " of the Kaffir table !
These notes were begun after sighting land for the first time after
leaving England, off the coast of Spain, where small flocks of those
wonderful little birds the Storm Petrels (Procellaria pelagica), whose
tiny wings never seem to tire all day long, followed in the wake of the
ship, never for a moment resting, their wings just seeming to skim
the surface of the water as they made their zigzag flight over the ocean.
Why they follow the ships I could never tell, for not once did I observe
them feed upon the refuse that was cast overboard.
When about a thousand miles from land another ocean wanderer
seemed to loom up from nowhere, that well-known bird the Wandering
Albatross (Diomedea melanopJirys) ; at first only one was seen, then
two, three, four, until there were perhaps eight or more. A creature
more graceful in the air could hardly be imagined--but on land it is as
ungainly as the Swan--with outspread motionless wings these birds
will follow the ship for days, sometimes coming so close that they can
be touched with the hand, their sharp eyes ever on the alert. How
and where they rest seems to be a mystery : the only time they settle
on the water is when they feed upon the scraps thrown overboard,
and then it is only a matter of a few seconds. Usually their plumage
is spotless, looking very different from the poor mangled specimens
one sees in museums. The food of this Albatross consists mainly
of the squid, octopus, and any variety of marine creatures, augmented
by carrion and garbage from ships.
When about five hundred miles from the coast of West Africa
we had a surprise visit from a Grey Wagtail and a Dove : what species
the latter was I do not know for sure, but I believe it was some species
allied to the Scaly-winded Dove. How these two birds came to be

right out in the ocean is a mystery. They only remained a few days
and then disappeared.
Soon after the Albatross came a pair of Southern Skuas (Stercorarius
antarcticus) put in their appearance. These birds superficially resemble
large brown Hawks, and seem equally at home on the wing as does the
Albatross. When many miles from the African coast the Southern
Skuas were joined by a pair of Richardson's Skuas (Stercorarius
crepidatus). These birds are slightly smaller than the former, and
have the two central tail-feathers long and pointed. Both these and
the Southern Skuas live principally by robbing the other sea-birds of
their lawful prey, though they also feed upon garbage and carrion.
Small parties of from about six to twelve Cape Cormorants
(Phalacrocorax capensis) were seen flying at right-angles to the ship,
apparently going out to sea for their day's fishing. These birds fly
low over the water, and form a great contrast to the Cape Gannets
(Sula capensis), which fly high over the waters, their snow-white
plumage glistening in the sunlight, dropping every now and then with
a great splash into the water, after having no doubt caught sight of
some tempting morsel.
As the boat neared Cape Town our feathered attendants became
more and more numerous, until as we sailed into Cape Town Harbour
we were the centre of a screaming mass of sea-birds. Amongst the
motley throng I noticed the pretty little Cape Pigeon (Daption capensis),
which is a Petrel and bears no resemblance to any member of the
Columbae, the Southern Black-backed Gull (Larus dominicanus) , and
Hartlaub's Gull (Larus hartlaubi), which seems to be the Southern
representative of the Black-headed Gull.
In and around Cape Town one observes many interesting birds.
In the public gardens, which are situated in the centre of the town and
which are a credit to the municipal authorities, one finds many birds.
The commonest and the most familiar, both in the gardens and the
city and its environs, is the Laughing Dove (Turtur senegalensis ),
a bird about the same size as the Bombay Dove but much more hand-
somely coloured superficially resembling the Common Turtle Dove.
In any part where there are trees one is sure to hear their incessant
coo. Many of these birds seem to have bred with the Cape Turtle

Sydney Porte&apos;)--Notes from Bhodesia
Dove ( Turtur capicolct), which is very common throughout the whole
of South Africa, but in Cape Town it frequents the outskirts of the town
and does not live in the town itself as does its smaller cousin. One
sees many hybrids between these two, exhibiting a mixture of plumage
of both birds.
Sometimes one sees at the docks a solitary specimen of the Jackass
Penguin ( Spheniscus demersus) quite at home amongst the ships and
looking more like a miniature seal in the water than a bird. These
birds breed on small islands on the West Coast, and are protected by
the Government, but their eggs are collected every year and sold for
edible purposes ; it was not the breeding season at the Cape during
my stay there, or I might have sampled them.
Underneath the pier at Cape Town are about half a dozen of these
wretched birds, confined with several seals in semi-darkness, half-
stunned and under most disgusting conditions. Amongst the crowd
of birds that one sees on the slopes of Table Mountain are two which
at once attract attention, namely the Cape Long-tailed Sugar Bird
(Promerops cafer) and the Orange-breasted Sunbird (Anthobaphes
violacea). The Sugar Bird, which has no relation to the Sugar Birds
of South America but is allied to the Sunbirds, is classed in a family
with one other closely allied species, the Natal Long-tailed Sugar
Bird. It is a general dull greyish brown colour with the rump and
tail-coverts olive yellow, the tail being extraordinarily long and
graduated, the bird itself being about 5J inches long and the tail 11 to
14 inches. The hen is similar in colour but lacks the long tail.
These birds are confined to Cape Provence, and are comparatively
common on the slopes of Table Mountain, frequenting the scrub of.
protea bushes, aloes, etc., feeding on the juices of the flowers and upon
various insects. I have seen them catching flying insects in the manner
of a Flycatcher, taking up a position on the topmost twig of a bush
and taking short upward flights into the air as an insect passed over-
head ; it is then that the bird is most conspicuous. It is said to play
a great part in the fertilization of the various flowering shrubs which
clothe the slopes of the world-famous mountain. The other bird, a
tiny jewel, whose plumage may be described as follows : The head,
neck, upper back, and throat rich metallic green ; the upper breast

metallic purple ; the lower breast orange red ; the lower back and tail-
coverts olive-yellow. The female is a drab brownish. The length
of this tiny bird is 6 inches, of which the tail takes up 3. Like
its near ally, the Sugar Bird, it frequents the shrub-covered mountain
slopes, feeding on nectar and insects, but it is never very conspicuous
owing to the fact that it lives in the denser bushes and thick under-
growth, hiding in the centres of the bushes as soon as it sees that it is
being w~atched. They seem to live in small parties, no doubt comprising
the old pair and their progeny.
The Cape White-Eye ( Zosterops capensis) is very common in Cape
Town and its environs. Always on the alert, so slim that it looks
as though it could be passed through a finger ring, with little fear of
man, searching in every nook and corner for the tiny insects upon
which it feeds, even round the lamps in the principal streets. I once
saw a White-Eye imprisoned in one, having got through a hole in the
bottom and evidently not able to find its w r ay out again. I couldn't
do anything, but in passing several hours later it was gone. Out of the
breeding season these birds are said to collect into small flocks, and
when insects are scarce to feed upon juices of flowers, berries, and soft
fruit.
The Cape Robin Chat ( Cassypha caffra) is another familiar bird
intermediate in size between the English Robin and the Thrush, and
in demeanour it resembles both. The upper parts being olive-brown,
the lower parts bright orange rufus, fading into slaty grey and dull
white towards the centre of the abdomen. The tail is rufus, and there
are two conspicuous eyebrow stripes of pure white.
It frequents the parks and gardens, spending most of its time under
the bushes and round and about flower beds searching for insects,
always on the alert and assuming the same confiding manner as our
Robin at home.
The Red-winged Starling (Amydrus morio) which in no way resembles
the bird of the same name in America, is fairly common, inhabiting
the rocky coastal parts. I have never seen these birds very far inland
at the Cape, but amongst the rocks and boulders, and they seem to
seldom perch upon them.
In size it is rather larger than the English Blackbird, but has

the same manner of flight. In colour it is glossy purplish black, the
inner webs of the flight feathers being chestnut red, so that it is only
in flight that the colour is seen. The flight feathers seem to have a
transparent tendency, for I have often noticed as the bird was flying
overhead in the sunlight, the light shone through the feathers, making
them appear a most beautiful orange red. The female is small and
duller than her mate. These birds nest in crevices in the rocks and
cliffs, making a nest of small sticks and grass, and laying four or five
bluish green eggs.
The food of this Starling, in common with most other members
of the Starling tribe, consists of insects, no doubt supplemented by
wild fruit and berries. They are said to be a pest in the orchards in
the fruit season.
The Pale-winged Starling ( Amydrus caffer) is also sometimes seen,
but is not nearly so common as the Red-wing. It is very similar in
habit and appearance, but the inner webs of the flight feathers are a
pale yellowish colour.
The Cape Wagtail (Motacilla capensis) is a very familiar little bird,
seen everywhere in the gardens, parks, roadsides, and even in the
streets, and especially on lawns searching for insects. In plumage
it somewhat resembles a pale edition of the European Grey Wagtail.
The Cape Sparrow ( Passer arcuatus), which is much darker and more
distinctly marked than its European cousin, frequents the gardens and
outlying districts of Cape Town, it differs also from Passer domesticus
in lacking the bold and confiding demeanour of that bird. Its behaviour,
too, is much more aristocratic, and it is nowhere common. It feeds
upon the seeds of grasses and weeds, and no doubt supplements its
diet with insects, especially during the breeding season.
The Fiscal Shrike (JLanius collaris) is an exceedingly common bird
in Cape Provence. In size about the same as the Common Shrike, its
plumage is an arrangement of black and white, the upper parts black
and the under parts white.
One always sees this bird in some conspicuous point of advantage
The top of a bush, or a post, or sometimes on the telegraph wires,
always on the look-out for its prey, which consists mainly of insects,
sometimes small birds and mice.

Its local name of Jack Hangman is no doubt derived from its practice
of impaling its surplus food upon thorns, which is common to most
of the Shrike family. It is a bird that courts attention, and even the
most unobservant would not fail to notice it.
The Bacbakiri Shrike ( Laniarius gutturalis) is a much rarer bird
than the foregoing, and quite different in appearance, superficially
resembling a Thrush than a Shrike. The upper parts are olive green,
the head greyish, the throat bright orange red. Below this is a broad
semi-circular black band which commences at the base of the beak,
passing down the side of the neck and across the middle of the breast.
The under parts are bright sulphur yellow. I have sometimes seen this
bird around Cape Town, but more often in the bush bordering the rivers
in Bhodesia, but I have never seen the Fiscal Shrike so far north.
Out on the lonely headlands around Cawe Town one occasionally
sees the South African Kestrel ( Tinnunculus rupicolus) behaving in
exactly the same way as the European Kestrel, from which it differs
but slightly, hovering high up in the air on the lookout for some
unfortunate mammal or bird below. #
The Cape Thrush (Turdus olivaceus) is a dark-looking bird, slaty
olive above, the throat white, striped with black and rufous, the breast
being dark olive going into orange rufous on the sides and lower
abdomen.
This bird makes its home in the rich bush lands and gardens, and
occasionally I have seen it in the public gardens at Cape Town, hunting
under bushes and plants, in very much the same manner as the Black-
bird, for insects. Although it is a fairly confiding bird, it does not like
being watched, and will at once take shelter behind a plant if it sees
one's eyes fixed upon it.
A very conspicuous bird around Cape Town is the Black and Yellow
Weaver (Pyromelana capensis), a fairly large bird for a Weaver, and
must not be confused with the commonly imported Black and Yellow
Weavers, which are quite different. The size is accentuated by the fact
that the bird puffs out its nuptial feathers, making it appear to be
nearly twice its real size. The plumage is rich velvety black, except
the lower back, which is brilliant yellow, the feathers being elongated,
and the shoulder and lesser wing-coverts, which are yellow also. The

hens are the usual type, that is, a mixture of browns, but this one
seems to have a very decided yellowish cast.
This very attractive little bird inhabits the marshy places and the
banks of rivers, or in fact anywhere where the tall reeds grow. There
it makes its nest, beautifully woven between two or more reed stems.
This lovely Weaver seems to be seldom imported into Great Britain,
for I have never seen it or heard of it for sale. The food consists of
grass and reed seeds, and also small insects.
The Rock Martin (Ptyonoprogne fuligula) a bird the size of a Swift,
and of a drab brown colour, is often seen flying around the lonely
promontories on the coast, always keeping around the rocks, and seldom
indulging in aerial gymnastics like the Swallows or other members of
the Martin family.
On the bush-veldt one notices a tiny brown Warbler-like bird with
a long tail which is held at right angles to the body, constantly on the
move, flitting from one grass stem to another. This is the Cape Wren
Warbler (Prinia maculosa ) which is fairly common, in Cape Provence.
On the Cape^ flats, a low-lying area of ground some miles outside
Cape Town, where there are rank marshes and open pools, one sees
the Common Heron ( Ardea cinerea) motionless beside the water, some-
times knee-deep, waiting for its prey; sometimes I have seen an
individual bird balancing on the wire fences, a difficult operation for
a bird with such large feet.
On the wilder slopes and on the hills and cliffs, and very often near
the artificially planted pine woods, is found the Ground Woodpecker
(Geocolajptes olivaceus ) a fairly large bird, olive brown in colour, striped
with faint lines of white in the usual Woodpecker fashion, the stripes
being more pronounced on the wings; the head is grey, the throat is
white, edged with grey, and tipped with crimson. The rump is crimson
too. The tail olive above and golden below, striped with white, the
feathers are pointed and tipped with red. The breast is olive, tipped
with crimson. The female is similar, but lacks the red about the head.
As its name implies, this bird is of terrestrial habits, associating
in small parties and searching the rough rock-strewn ground for the
insects upon which it feeds, using the long tongue to procure them
from out of the crevices and fissures in the rocks.

The colouring of this bird makes it a very conspicuous object,
especially when flying, for then the brightly coloured rump is exposed
to view. The flight is rapid, very heavy, and the bird usually flies just
above the ground.
A bird that is fairly common in Cape Provence is the Grey-headed
Bush Shrike ( Laniarius starJci) which haunts the sparse covered bush
lands and the scrub-covered hill sides. Outside Cape Town at Groot
Schuer is a small collection of birds and mammals got together in the
days of Rhodes, and it has apparently been dwindling ever since, the
collection seldom being augmented by fresh additions. There are
quite a few water-fowl living in a state of semi-freedom. Spur-winged
Geese (Plectropterus gambensis), Knob-billed Duck ( Sarcidiornis
melanonota), White-faced Tree Duck (Dendrocygna viduata), Yellow-
billed Duck ( Anas undulata ), also one or two Stanley Cranes ( Tetra-
pieryx paradisea), and Ostriches. In aviaries there are a few birds of
prey, Weavers, and Waxbills. The collection hardly justifies the name
of Zoo, as the local residents term it.

A collector employed by Messrs. A. W. Gamage, Limited, arrived
in London on 20th July, with a wonderful collection of birds from
South Africa, many of which are new to aviculture. They arrived
in most perfect condition, most of them without a feather out of place,
and very great credit is due to the collector for the great care with which
he brought these birds home. The most striking of all were the Crimson-
breasted Shrikes ( Laniarius atrococcineus) , with upper parts black and
under parts vivid crimson; examples were first imported in 1923
(Avicultural Magazine, 1923, p. 247). Then there was the Bacbakiri
Shrike (L. gutturalis), an olive-green bird with yellow throat, and the
Greater Puff-backed Shrike (Dryoscopus ferrugineus ) which is glossy
black above with fluffy erectile feathers of orange-buff on the rump,
the under parts being white tinged with rufous-buff ; and the Long-
tailed Shrike (Urolestes melanoleucus) with glossy black and white
plumage and long tail.

The White-shouldered Robin Chats ( Cossypha humeralis), of which
there were several in the collection, is a very beautiful species, combining
black, white, orange-red, and grey in its plumage. The Cape Robin
Chat ( C . caffra) also represented in the collection, has been previously
imported several times.
The White-shouldered Bush Chat (Thamnolcea cinnamomeiventris)
is glossy black above, the rump and upper and under tail-coverts
chestnut; a whitish line separating the breast from the abdomen,
which is chestnut-red. It is said to be a good songster. The Mountain
Chat ( Saxicola monticola) has the plumage brownish-black with the
rump and upper tail-coverts white. The male goes through several
stages of plumage, some old birds being entirely grey.
The Ground-scraper Thrush (Turdus litsipsirupa) and the Cape or
Olivaceous Thrush (T. olivaceus) were both attractive species, as was
also the Short-toed Rock Thrush (Monticola hrevipes) with its slate-blue
head and back, white eyebrow, and chestnut under parts and tail.
There were two very beautiful Plovers, Temminck's Courser
(Cursorius temmincki) a smaller and richer-coloured bird than the Cream-
coloured Courser, and the Crowned Lapwing (Stephanibyx coronatus)
an exceedingly handsome species of which we publish an illustration.
There was a long-tailed Roller ( Coracias caudatus) and a number of
Red-vented Tit Babblers ( Parisoma subcceruleum) a very attractive
little grey bird with a chestnut-red patch under the tail.
Of the three species of Sunbird in the collection, the Southern
Bifasciated Sunbird (Cinnyris mariquensis) is apparently nSw to
aviculture.

Toucans (Rhamphastidse) are a very homogenous family of big
birds from tropical America, characterized by an enormous beak,
in some cases as large as the whole body, brightly coloured and very
light; the tongue is a flattened blade. This beak gives the Toucan
a very peculiar and somewhat deformed appearance, but its brilliant
colouring, added to the equally gay ones of its plumage, always attract

attention. Toucans are entirely arboreal and inhabit forests, principally
the tree-tops ; to see them fly past with their huge beaks cleaving the
air is a curious spectacle which I have often witnessed in Guiana.
Toucans feed on fruits, large insects, and small vertebrate animals ;
they nest in holes in large trees. In captivity they are more often
met with in Zoological Gardens than in private collections, but they
are very amusing and often exceedingly tame. I have owned a great
many : their only drawback being their frightfully harsh voice. They
thrive perfectly on boiled rice, boiled potato, bananas, and other fruit
and insectivorous food, to which a little meat should be added. They
succeed well in an outdoor aviary during the summer, but require
heat through the winter.
The Toucans proper (Rhamphastos) are the largest of the family, the
Toco being as large as a Crow and also having the biggest beak. They
all have the upper parts of the body black with the subcaudal feathers
and under parts white, yellow, or red. Ten species have been imported,
an$ some are generally in stock among the dealers.
The Toco Toucan ( R . toco), the largest of the genus, is black with
a white throat, shading into yellow on the breast; the upper tail-
coverts are white, the under ones red ; the enormous beak and the bare
skin round the eyes are reddish-yellow ; the base and point of the beak
are black. It is a native of Guiana and the Argentine.
The Keel-billed Toucan (R. piscivorus) inhabits Central America
and the South of Mexico. It is black like the preceding, white above
the tail, and red underneath it, but the mark on the throat is larger
and bright yellow, edged with red on the breast; the skin of the face
is light green and the beak the same except that the point and part
of the upper mandible are red and the base has a black circle. It is
not as large as the Toco.
The Short-billed Toucan (R. hrevicaratus) found from Honduras
to Colombia, is like the above save that its beak is smaller.
The Tocard Toucan (R. tocard), extending from Honduras to the
Equator, has the same plumage as the preceding, but is larger and its
large beak is black beneath and red above.
The Red-billed Toucan (R. erythrorhynchus) , from Guiana, is black
with yellow upper tail-coverts and red under ones, the throat and

upper breast pale yellow, edged with red at the bottom, the skin of the
face and base of the lower mandible sky blue, the base and arc of the
upper mandible yellow, and the rest vinous red.
Cuvier's Toucan ( R . cuvieri) found from Colombia to Peru, has
that part of its beak black which is red with R. erythrorhynchus.
The Culminated Toucan ( R . culminatus ), found from Venezuela
to Bolivia, is a smaller edition of Cuvier's Toucan, but the base of its
bill is green instead of white.
The next three species are the most freely imported, especially
the Green-billed Toucan ; they have smaller bills and the bright colours
are more widely diffused than with the preceding.
The Ariel Toucan (R. arid) is black with tail-coverts and lower
breast carmine red ; the throat and upper breast are deep golden
yellow, bordered with light yellow ; the beak is black, its base yellow
edged with black ; the skin of the face bright rose colour. It is found
in the east of Brazil.
The Sulphur and White-breasted Toucan (R. vitellinus), ranging
from Venezuela to Brazil, has much white on the top and sides of
the throat; the skin of the face and base of the beak also are white.
Otherwise it resembles the above.
The Green-billed Toucan (R. discolorus), from South-East Brazil
and Paraguay, is the most popular of the genus ; it is very much like
the Ariel Toucan, but has more red on the under parts ; its bill is
yellowish-green with a black band at the base.
Very pretty little Toucans have been fairly often imported : olive-
green above, old gold to yellow underneath and on the head and
neck ; the upper tail-coverts red, as are also the skin of the face and
sides of the bill near the base, surrounded with bluish grey, the rest
of the bill being yellowish green. This is Baillon's Toucan ( Andigena
bailloni) from South-East Brazil.
The Aracaris (Pteroglossus) are small or medium-sized Toucans,
with long bills not so high as those of Rhamphastos, curved and having
marked notches in the upper mandible.
The Black-necked Aracari (P. aracari), from Guiana and East
Brazil, has a black head and neck, the upper back wings and tail
dark green, yellow underneath, with a red band on the lower breast;

the lower back also is red ; its bill is black, but the sides of the upper
mandible are dull yellow, as is also an edging near the face.
The Collared Aracari ( P . torquatus), native of Colombia, differs
from the above by its breast and abdomen being yellow barred and
marked with red and black, and its beak which is black beneath and
along the culmen, yellow shaded red on the sides.
The Lettered Aracari (P. inscriptus ), from North-East Brazil, is
smaller and distinguished from the preceding by its clear yellow breast
and abdomen, and its yellow bill, black along the culmen at the base
and point, with spots of the same along the sides of the upper mandible.
There are a great many more kinds of Aracaris which closely resemble
those just described ; some may have been imported, but it is not
possible to assert it positively.
The Toucanets (Selenidera) are small Toucans with proportionately
smaller bills ; they are all almost alike except in the colouring of their
bills. Unlike the other Toucans the sexes are different in plumage.
The Spotted-billed Toucanet ( S . maculirostris) is freely imported.
The male has dark olive green back and wings ; tail of the same colour
tipped with chestnut; the head, neck, and all the breast are black
with the exception of the cheeks, which are orange-yellow, and a clear
yellow spot which lengthens them ; the dark green of the back is
separated from the black of the neck by a yellow band.; orange sides,
yellowish green abdomen. The bare skin on the face is green, the bill
grey, with the culmen and point green spotted black. The female has
those parts chestnut which are black in the male. This species does
well in confinement and has nested in a log but failed to rear young.
The Green Toucans ( Aulacorhamphus ) are usually fairly small;
they have grass-green plumage more or less tinted with blue, chestnut,
or pale grey. Two species have been imported which live well in an
inside aviary : A. sulcatus from Venezuela, where I captured it, which
has. a black and red bill; and A. prasinus from Mexico, which has the
tail tipped with chestnut, this being also the colour of the under tail-
coverts and the base of the abdomen ; its yellow and black bill is
exactly like a ripe banana.

THE BARBETS

Barbets as a family rather remind one of Toucans ; but though
their beaks are thick and strong they have nothing whatever in common
with the enormous appendages of the latter ; like them, however,
they .have short wings and bright colouring ; their tails are often
short and they are fairly small; the smallest are the size of a Goldfinch
and the biggest that of a Jay.
They are arboreal and are usually seen on the tree-tops, uttering
their monotonous and often repeated call. They nest and shelter in
holes in the trees. Certain species are to be met with in trees in gardens
and streets of towns ; the little Red-fronted Barbet (Xantholcema ), for
instance, is very common in Saigon. On the contrary others are purely
forest birds.
Their food is a mixture of insects and fruits ; according to the
species they are more or less insectivorous or frugivorous. The
Asiatic species eat chiefly fruit, the Americans are, on the contrary,
extremely insectivorous, and the Africans come midway between the
two. Barbets are to be found in the tropics of all three continents
and the islands of Souda and the Philippines.
Barbets live very well in cages or indoor aviaries, but I have not
found them do well in the open air ; they are very easy to manage
under cover, and I myself own a Giant Barbet which has been more
than six years in confinement. Their bright colours and their tameness
make them very pleasant to keep, and they should be given insectivorous
mixture, fruits, boiled rice and insects.
About twenty species have been imported, and as they are easy
to keep alive no doubt many others will be imported some day.
The Collared Barbet (Lybius torquatus) inhabits South Africa,
and two or three specimens have turned up of late years. I had one,
which proved easy to keep. About the size of a small Thrush, it is
olive-green above, the wings and tail variegated with yellow ; the head
and throat are bright red ; the nape and chest black ; the under parts
are yellow. The rather hooked beak is black.
The Pied Barbet (Tricholcema leucomelan), from the same parts,

was imported with the preceding, and I have had several. It is small;
the upper part of the body is black, spotted and streaked with yellow,
except the shoulders, which are marked with white ; the under parts
are white ; the head is black, with large pale yellow eyebrows, white
moustaches, and red forehead ; the beak is black.
The Giant Barbet ( Megalcema virens) is a native of Upper Burmah
and South China, and a very closely allied species {M. marshallorum)
inhabits the Himalayas ; the first-named has a dark green head,
the other a violet blue one ; both kinds have the breast, the middle
of the back, and wings brown, the flight feathers and tail green ; red
under the tail; a yellow crescent on the upper part of the back ;
the under part of the body striped yellow and brown, with the middle
bluish green ; the yellowish green beak is very large. This is the largest
of the Barbets ; it lives very well in confinement.
The Blue-throated Barbet (Cyanops asiatica) is most frequently
imported and can easily be obtained ; it inhabits the Himalayas ;
its body is bright green ; its head light blue, having the crown and
two little spots on the sides of its neck a beautiful carmine red ; the
mark on the head is cut by a black band, which is prolonged above
the eyebrows ; its beak is horn-coloured. It is a medium-sized bird.
A great many kinds closely resemble the Blue-throated Barbet,
the only differences being their size and colouring of the head and
neck. I believe two species have been imported : C. franklini from
the Eastern Himalayas has black, yellow, red, and grey marks on the
head, and C.fiavifrons from Ceylon (whence I brought three specimens),
which has the under parts slightly watered dark green on light green,
the throat and cheeks blue, the upper part of the head and the
moustaches yellow.
The Grey-headed Barbets (Thereiceryix) are rather large. They
have green plumage, with the head, neck, and breast grey streaked
with buff. Their rather long beaks vary from yellow to flesh pink.
They are very common in their native country.
Three species have been imported :-- T. zeylonicus, from India and
Ceylon, has a yellow beak and a fairly dark head. T. viridis, from
Southern India, is smaller with a black beak, a light breast, and the
top of the head dark. T. lineatus, from Indo-China, has a rosy-grey

beak, head and neck pale tawny, each feather bordered with dark
grey. They live well in confinement.
The Red-fronted Barbet (Xantholoema ncematocephala) , widely
spread throughout tropical Asia, Sumatra, and the Philippines, is a
pretty little bird, green above ; the top of its head is bright red ;
this red cap and the cheeks are outlined with a black line which also
passes through the eye delimitating two yellow spots above and below ;
its throat is yellow, its breast red, edged below with yellow ; the under
parts of the body is yellowish streaked with green.
Le Vaillant's Barbet (Trachyphonus cafer), from South-East Africa,
is occasionally imported. It is a largish grey-green bird with a weak
recurved beak ; it has a black crest, is spotted green and red except
on the nape which, together with the neck, the upper breast and back,
is black. The wings and tail are black marked with white ; the lower
back yellow and the under tail-feathers red ; the lower breast is yellow,
striped red ; belly yellow. It lives well in a cage and is more
insectivorous than the preceding.
The Pearl-spotted Barbet (T. margaritatus), from Senegambia and
Abyssinia, has been rather frequently imported during the past few
years ; I owned the first two. Smaller than the preceding, it has
a red beak ; its head is black on top, yellow below ; the nape is yellow
spotted with black ; the upper part of the back, wings, and tail are
brown, spotted wdth white ; the lower back is yellow ; subcaudal
feathers red ; a necklace of black and red spots on the breast; lower
parts yellow.
The Ked-throated Barbet (Capita niger) is the only American
species which has been brought alive to Europe. I brought back
a male from Gluiana in 1922 ; it is black and yellow with a red forehead
and throat.

and Asia. They feed on insects and fruits. They are to be met with
in the tropical parts of Asia, Africa, and America. In this last-named
country they are most plentiful and also most beautiful, especially
the Quetzal of Guatemala, clad in shining green mingled with carmine
and having a very long tail. Most of the American and African species
are blue or green above, red or yellow below ; the Asiatic are more
often brown above, red or yellow underneath ; but all are magnificent.
Unfortunately it is hard to accustom Trogons to confinement and
they have always been very rare in our &apos;aviaries ; only one species
has been imported to my knowledge, which is the Cuban Trogon
(.Prionotelus temnurus ), which has the crown of the head and neck
blue and the under parts, as well as the breast, pale grey ; the back and
middle of the tail are a fine golden green ; the wings are black and white
as well as the lateral rectrices ; the abdomen is bright pink ; the tail
of this bird is very curious, every feather being ended by two lateral
horns.
This Trogon in confinement does well on insectivorous mixture,
mealworms, and other insects and fruit; but care must be taken to
eliminate everything tough, such as grape skins ; otherwise it will
suffer from intestinal obstruction. I kept two of these birds for several
years.
A South African species ( Hapaloderma narina) has been caged in
the Transvaal.

The Willow Warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus)
This little Warbler is about the commonest of all the summer
migrants--it is common everywhere.
It has no particularly favourite haunt, it just settles down contented
anywhere. On some open commons, nearly every 30 or 40 yards
there is a Willow Warbler perched on the twigs of some bush,
or on the top of a piece of furze, or on the boughs of some blackthorn
snow-white with blossom.

The late P. P. M. Galloway --
The song is not of great compass, beginning with a high note and
running down the scale, but is pleasing and quite in keeping with
other familiar spring songs of birds.
The nest, which is domed, is built on the ground of dry grass and
mosses in a piece of rough grass or under a small piece of bramble,
or sometimes in a grassy bank beside a wood, in fact, in a variety of
situations, but always on the ground and lined with feathers and
generally speaking is fairly well concealed. The young, after their
first moult are a much brighter colour than their parents, the breast
especially being of a much yellower greenish tinge. A cage 18 inches
long, 13 inches high, by 9 inches deep, will suit this bird well, with the
usual perches placed as mentioned previously for other species. Foods
should be the same, but no fruit or berries are required in their menu.
There is nothing very interesting in this species as a cage bird?
both song and colour being poor rather as compared with others,
but may be interesting where variety is sought after.
The Garden Warbler (Sylvia hortensis)
Why this bird is called the Garden Warbler I can never understand,
for this species is not more addicted to gardens than any of the other
Warblers.
The Garden Warbler can be found in a variety of places and seems
satisfied with the rank growth of brambles outside a wood, on commons
generally on the outskirts, in thick ragged hedgerows, in bushes beside
streams, and numerous other situations.
This species is a good songster, but in my opinion not so fine as
either the Blackcap or Nightingale, previously mentioned. Its
song has a deep tone and several notes resembling some of the passages
sung by the Blackbird.
As a rule, their nests are built like those of the Blackcap, but
much firmer ; the young are very much like their parents in colour,
and are easily reared by hand.
The Garden Warbler often has two broods in the season ; the second
I have known just leave the nest as late as the first week in August.
They are fond of ripe fruit, such as raspberries, red currants, and
cherries, also partial to elderberries and the red glassy or transparent

berries of the wild honeysuckle, which show in little bunches where
the flower has fallen.
The cage for this bird should be the same as used for the Blackcap,
and the feeding and treatment the same as for that species.
The Chiff-chaff (Phylloscopus rufus)
This is about the hardiest of all our spring migrants, arriving
sometimes as early as the 17th March. I have known isolated instances
where it has been heard and seen by the 28th February.
This hardy little migrant will sit on a bough with the rough, chilly
wind and stormy weather rocking him backwards and forwards, and
in spite of all this he will sing his well known notes of " chi A:, chaff
Although it is cold, we can say with truth that spring is here. The
dog's mercury is unfolding its leaves in the wood, the bluebells have
poked their noses out of decayed leaves on the ground, the white-
thorn is trying to burst into bright delicate green, and many signs
of out-of-door life begin to show, that although it is cold we have
slipped away from the dark, dreary days of November and December.
The catkins on the hazel, the palm-trees, the first hibernating brimstone
butterfly flits past you ; they all tell you that the spring is here, and
the best time of the year is close at hand.
Our little harbinger of spring seems to have been in a hurry to
get here and overshot the mark, but in a very short time a finer type
of weather will follow him, although it may be a short spell; the little
Chiff-chaff seldom appears to make a mistake. This bird is fairly
distributed over the country, but although it is common, it is not so
plentiful as the Willow Warbler. The nest is again a domed one,
but is not built upon the ground like that of the Willow Warbler or
Wood Wren, but is placed more often than not in brambles, sometimes
in the middle of a wood, sometimes just in a corner of the wood,'and
generally from one to two feet off the ground. It is rather a larger
nest than either the Willow or Wood Warbler's, and built of dead grass,
moss, and often a fair quantity of dead leaves, and thickly lined with
feathers.
I seldom see young Chiff-chaffs out of the nest until quite the end
of June, and although it is possible that an earlier nest has been built

The late P. F. M. Galloway --
and destroyed, yet I am inclined to think, although this bird is such
an early visitor to this country, it does not nest so early as one would
imagine. Often, two broods are reared in the season, the second
sometimes not being out of the nest until early August.
This bird's familiar song is uttered all through the season until
the moult begins, then it is silent; but after the moult, sometimes
far into September, it is again heard, even up to the second week in
October, when he sings " adieu ", for he will suddenly depart, and
about the time he is missed the Redwing from the North has taken
his place--the trees are rapidly turning colour--the end of the season
is here.
If this species is kept a cage as recommended for the Willow Wren
will do. The feeding exactly the same as for that bird. It is a hardy
bird and will stand a wonderful amount of cold. I once saw one on the
15th of December, after a severe black frost, trying to find food on
a blackberry bramble, and no doubt it perished through hunger.
The Wryneck (lynx torquilla)
The Wryneck is an interesting bird ; although not brightly coloured
the markings of various shades of browns, greys, and black are
beautifully arranged. It is a good size, being much larger than the
Nightingale.
The upper parts, including the crown of the head, are of a mottled
grey and brown ; on the nape of the neck in the centre, a narrow dark
brown streak occurs which widens as it reaches the back and is about
three quarters of an inch in the widest part, the rump and upper tail-
coverts speckled grey and brown ; on the shoulder is a band of very
dark brackish brown tipped with greyish white. The throat and upper
breast is pale orange buff, becoming paler on the belly and under parts ;
round the throat there are fine pencilled lines of brown, like half circles,
and when the breast is reached these lines are replaced with fine arrow
or Y marks on the tips of the feathers and carried right down the
flanks ; on the side of the face there is also a short brown slanting
streak ; the flights are dark brown with more or less square spots of
light chestnut brown on the outer edges. The tail-feathers rather
broad, mottled grey with about four of more or less distinct bars of

How to Keep Insectivorous Birds in Perfect Condition 229
dusky brown ; under tail-coverts buff with dusky arrow marks, like
the breast.
The whole plumage being handsomely mottled puts one in mind
of a weather beaten piece of the bark of a tree, this bird being very
similar in its shades of browns and greys to the Nightjar. The hen is
a trifle smaller, and the dark brown mark in the centre of the back
is neither so long or broad as in the opposite sex. The bird is very
early in its arrival; I have heard it on several occasions by the 31st
of March.
The songs of birds are often difficult to describe in writing. The
notes resemble as near as possible " Qui, qui, kew, kew, kew, kew ",
very much like the cry of the Kestrel but not so shrill. The tongue
of this species is long and the feet have twm toes in front and two behind,
as in the Woodpeckers, but unlike the latter they do not climb the
boles of trees, their tail not being stiff and pointed they would get no
support. Some writers state that the Wryneck's food consists of ants
and other insects ; personally, I am convinced they feed entirely on
meadow ants, both red and black, and their eggs, and also feed their
young entirely on these, so that in reality they are birds that do no
good nor harm, as the ant is as harmless an insect as the earthworm.
This bird is sometimes called the Cuckoo's mate on account of its
arriving about the same time as that bird, while it does nothing of
the sort. It arrives a fortnight in advance of the Cuckoo, although
we read of persons having heard the Cuckoo even in February. I
know these early Cuckoos ; and the note that was heard was never
produced from the throat of a Cuckoo at that time of the year, for this
species arrives between the 12th and 14th of April, and in many seasons
nearer the 18th.
The Wryneck, like the Woodpecker, builds no nest, but uses an
existing hole in a tree. They will, however, bore into a decayed tree
and make a very neat nesting-hole, but their beak being very much
weaker than the Woodpecker's, the tree has to be a soft dead one.
They will select sometimes a natural hole in an old pollard, but as a rule
they are more often met with in fruit orchards, and the nesting hole
is often an existing one in a cherry-tree.
Although this bird is an early visitor to this country, one would

imagine they would nest quite early. They would probably do so
if it were not for the Starlings, who seize every hole they can find,
therefore, they are compelled to wait until the latter have flown,
which is often well into June. I have known the Wryneck not able
to nest until early July, and sometimes have young in the nest only
fit to fly by the 12th of August, grouse-shooting day. The eggs, from
seven to ten in number, are pure white. The young are fed, as
previously stated, on ants and their eggs, only these are licked up,
not pecked up, by the parents. The tongue has a glutinous substance
on the little barbs at the extreme point, and if you were to place fresh ant
cocoons on a sheet of blapk paper in front of a tame Wryneck the
tongue would be darted out so rapidly that the eggs would fly up to
the beak as a needle would to a magnet.
Some years ago I found a hole in a cherry-tree so low that I could
stand and look into it. It contained young Wrynecks, five in number,
only about three days old. The eyes appeared not to be open and
they were, of course, bald. I had not been at the hole a minute before
I discovered that a swarm of bees were taking possession of the nest-
hole. These young and the old birds would have all been stung to
death before long, and as it was, when I got them out one of the
youngsters had already been stung on the head and was wriggling
about in agony and I had to destroy it. I had a terribly anxious
time in getting them safely out, for every time I put my hand in
a bee either wanted to go in or else come out, and I was quite half
an hour getting them out of the hole. Sometimes I had to clear away
altogether, especially when they came in massed formation. At last
I got them safely, and I at once filled the entrance hole up tightly
with mud. This I did so that the adults should not nest there again
only to be killed. I got the four young nicely warm, and kept them
in artificial heat, fed them on the natural food, ants' eggs, and they
grew tremendously fast, feathered well, and when full grown were the
largest and finest Wrynecks I have ever seen. I consider I saved their
lives for certain.
The Wryneck has a peculiar habit of hissing at an intruder if
he should look into the nest-hole when the bird is incubating. It will
twist its neck round and round, raise its feathers on the head, and then

They become exceedingly tame in confinement, but must be hand-
reared ; an adult is useless, they never appear to become so tame as
other adult birds. The cage for this species should be the size of that
recommended for a Nightingale ; the floor and perches should be
kept scrupulously clean, or they suffer with foot trouble. A good
layer of peat and sawdust mixed should be used. They are

THE BREEDING OF HYBRID QUEEN ALEXANDRA
AND CRIMSON-WINGED PARRAKEETS
(Polytelis alexandrce X Ptistes erythropterus)
By the Marquess of Tavistock
My first attempt at breeding this cross was made in the summer

<bodyText confidence="0.985540294117647" page_id="56188713"  page_num="231" year="" vol="">
of 1923. At that time I had no hen Alexandra Parrakeet, my only
specimen being a cock, aviary bred in Australia. I had tried unsuccess-
fully to pair him with a Sulu Island King Parrakeet, but he would have
nothing to do with her, and having a spare hen Crimson-wing, known
to be a breeder, I thought I would see if he liked her any better. They
soon took to one another, and the Crimson-wing laid four eggs in a
" grandfather-clock " nest-box. Two young birds were hatched, but
only survived for a few days. I have since found that this type of
nest-box, while attractive enough to Parrakeets that object to the
ordinary patterns, gives very poor results, anyhow in the open flight,
and young seldom thrive in it.
In 1924, the Alexandra and Crimson-wing were occupied with mates
of their own species, and the latter reared two young in part of a natural
tree trunk which I gave her as a substitute for the unsatisfactory
artificial nest. This year the two birds were again disengaged, and
I provided them with the same tree trunk in which the Crimson-wing
had been successful last season. When first introduced, the couple

232 Breeding of Queen Alexandra and Crimson-winged Parrakeets
did not seem very friendly, the Crimson-wing being the master, but
after a time she began to affect a great timidity and coyness, even
though the Alexandra was quite anxious to make advances. My
belief is that the Crimson-wing really rather enjoys the thrashing and
bullying she gets from a male of her own species, and finds the courtship
of a polite and gentle suitor rather a slow business. Hence, if she has
no real cause to fear her partner, she likes anyhow to pretend that he
is a dreadful tyrant !
The Crimson-wing usually lays in April, but this season was a very
late one, and May was well advanced before she began to take a serious
interest in the log. In dire course the squeaks of young birds were
heard, and about the middle of July two hybrids emerged. In
appearance they resembled the mother more closely than the father.
They were quite as big as Crimson-wings of their age, but more slenderly
built. The main colouring is green, of which two shades are noticeable
on the wing. The lower edge of the yfing is scarlet, the amount of red
feathers being not noticeably less than in a pure-bred Crimson-wing.
The thighs and most of the under-surface of the tail are pink, and the
male had a trace of pink on the throat and some grey on the head, the
rump also being grey. The tail is intermediate in shape between that
of the two parents, less tapering than an Alexandra's, but longer and
narrower than a Crimson-wing's. Unfortunately, the more brightly
coloured bird was unexpectedly picked up dead early one morning.
The survivor is a beautiful specimen, and now quite independent of
her parents, but I fear that there is little doubt of her sex, and her
plumage changes will be small and of little interest, whereas her
brother, had he lived, should have developed into something truly
gorgeous and original.

BUDGERIGAR BREEDING IN TOULOUSE
By J. Bailly-Maitre

[We are permitted to reproduce this extremely interesting article
from U0is.edu, the translation from the French having been most
kindly undertaken by Miss Ohawner.]
Everybody may know that Toulouse is the town of&apos; violets, but
it is not yet so well known that it might also claim the name of
Parrakeet Capital.
The industry of breeding Budgerigars--for it has really assumed
the proportions of an industrial undertaking--was started about
1880 in this town.
Until then the rearing of Budgerigars was almost entirely carried
on in Belgium, and our amateurs and dealers were dependent on
certain Belgians who, like M. Grheure-Petit of Bineke, had undertaken
the breeding of these birds on a large scale.
In Toulouse the industry started in the most modest fashion.
The invasion of phylloxera, which since 1875 reached its height in
the southern vineyards, had brought about pretty well everywhere
the introduction of American vine stocks destined to replace the
French vines. Among the nurserymen who devoted themselves
to this new culture was a M. Bastide, who at the same time was so
passionately fond of birds that he devoted all the spare time his business
allowed him to leaving Toulouse and selling birds at the various fairs
held in the Vicinity. My childhood's memories are full of the delight
experienced at every visit I paid to the caravan of Bastide the bird
dealer. And then what a caravan ! The immense carriage was so

arranged that in front of the part intended for the hawker's dwelling
one side was completely covered by bird cages ; you had only to raise
one panel and to let down another to see the most dazzling display of
many-hued birds, fluttering and chirping among the copper and glass
beads with which the interior was abundantly furnished.
Then one day the caravan did not come, and I heard that its
proprietor had given up these journeys in order to devote himself
altogether to rearing Parrakeets.
It was not until 1888 that I went for the first time to the Avenue
Frizac in Toulouse to visit the establishment founded by the old
hawker. I was absolutely amazed. How they were changed, those
little cages which I used to see fastened to the side of the caravan !
In a huge quadrangle entirely enclosed by walls were on three sides
two rows, one above the other, of spacious aviaries 4 metres by
6 metres in depth by 3 metres in height--forty-eight aviaries in
all! And peopled by such a crowd of Budgerigars ! Every aviary
on the ground floor contained breeding pairs, from sixty to eighty
couples ; in the upper storey young birds were placed in companies
of from four to five hundred, so that I had in view more than 15,000
Budgerigars.
I remember that autumn had just begun and everyone in the
establishment w r as busy separating the cocks and hens for the winter ;
they were cleaning out the nest-boxes and the quantity of clear and
unhatched eggs was so enormous that they were taken away by the
wheelbarrow full. This detail will give some idea of the size of Bastide's
establishment even as far back as 1888.
I revisited the Avenue Frizac many times and always found fresh
enlargements ; three more " Parrucheries ", at least as large as the first,
were added to the one which I have just described.
A still greater surprise awaited me in 1913. Messrs. Bastide Brothers,
who had succeeded their father, had lately constructed their " Jardin
d'Acclimatation ", a huge open-air rearing ground covering two and
a half acres of ground, and containing 112 aviaries arranged in most
attractive surroundings.
As already intimated, each one of Bastide's aviaries is 4 metres
long by 6 deep and 2*90 or 3 metres high. Four metres of the

depth are covered and enclosed on three sides and serve as shelters ;
the 2 metres in front are entirely covered with large meshed wire-
netting, which prevents attacks by cats or other beasts of prey. The
average population of Bastide's " Perrucheries " is between 80,000
and 100,000, and if one were to place the 290 aviaries end to
end in a straight line one would have 1,200 metres of them.
Therefore one must walk several kilometres in order to visit them in
detail and observe the enormous number of birds which they contain.
To gain a real idea of the importance of such establishments one
should see the seed store replenished. 600, 800, or even 1,000 sacks
of millet are required every two or three months by the Bastides
to feed their birds, and at present prices this quantity costs annually
between 350,000 and 360,000 francs.
If one adds to these figures the expense of employing at least
twenty people, and the interest on the enormous capital locked up
in this enterprise, one can readily comprehend that it is necessary
to rear and sell more and yet more Budgerigars if at the end of the
year the undertaking is to show a satisfactory balance-sheet.
Though most industries suffered on account of the war it can
safely be asserted that none lost more heavily than the Budgerigar
breeding establishments of Toulouse. England, Germany, and Russia
were their chief customers. Suddenly all these outlets were closed,
and besides it was necessary to suppress all useless mouths. Con-
sequently after August, 1914, the House of Bastide had to slaughter
all the 120,000 Budgerigars in their aviaries at the declaration of war ;
for five years their aviaries remained silent and empty, and though
they are now as full as ever it is easy enough to understand what
huge sums had to be spent after the w T ar in order to regain a sufficient
number of birds to start the business once more.
Blanchard's Ornithological Establishments, which own two very
important rearing centres in Toulouse, are nearly as old as those of
Bastide. They were founded, to be exact in 1886, and their yearly
output to-day exceeds several tens of thousands of Budgerigars.
Nevertheless, while the Bastide breeding establishment confines
itself at present to supplying the world's market with green or yellow
Budgerigars, the rival house has of late years taken up the production
of all the other colour varieties of this Parrakeet.

Although M. Blanchard is still a dealer who turns out myriads
of Budgerigars, one can discern in him the amateur who is really
interested in his birds.
The " Perrucheries Blanchard " actually rear hundreds of Blue
Budgerigars, which were so intensely rare and only within the reach
of a few privileged amateurs. Some of the aviaries in Blanchard's
establishment are occupied only by Olive Budgerigars, a very distinct
variety created by M. Blanchard himself. He also produces the jade
and watered varieties, and is trying with all his might to evolve a
pure white Budgerigar. No modification in the plumage of his strains
escapes M. Blanchard, and by dint of methodical selection he has
lately announced the creation of two new varieties, the lilac and
the grey.
When one visits collections of Budgerigars as important as those
of Blanchard one is struck by the numerous variations -in the plumage
of these birds. There are, we believe, few kinds of animals which
having been for such a short time in the hands of man, have produced
so many varieties. If one refers to the information supplied by
Hervieux de Chanteloup in his " New Treatise on the Canary Finches "
which was published in 1785, one can see that at that date the varieties
of Canaries really fixed were not in any way superior to what we now
find among Budgerigars ; yet the Canary has been cage bred for not
less than three centuries, while the Budgerigar is still a comparatively
recent introduction.
It seems that the great variability which this little Parrakeet has
displayed in so short a time must be attributed to certain favourable
circumstances, and among others to the facility with which the species
has acclimatized itself in every country to which it has been introduced,
and its remarkable fertility, which has enabled it to breed in great
numbers in confinement. When one remembers that change of climate,
food, and style of living represent the essential factors of variation,
one can understand how, removed from its original country, deprived
of its natural food and subjected to a mode of life quite different to
that which it enjoyed when free, the Budgerigar once it became
acclimatized and, so to speak, domesticated, must obey the law of
variation, of which all other domestic animals furnish examples. For

all that one could name plenty of other species which, although reared
in captivity for many generations, have not yet given us any one of
the individual modifications of which the Budgerigar is so lavish.
But it must not be forgotten that variation only appears in very rare
cases, and therefore it is necessary to produce a great many individuals
to insure the likelihood of obtaining one which has some peculiarity
which is capable of giving birth to a new variety. When one considers
the enormous development in the breeding of this little Parrakeet
since its importation and how it is intensively cultivated in confinement,
one understands that it is most favourably placed in the required
conditions to bring about the numerous varieties which we may observe
in it to-day.
As is always noticed in similar cases the Budgerigar's plumage
was unchanged for a long time after it became acclimatized, and
for many years amateurs only knew the primitive green type,
which they considered, and justly, to be a marvel. Nobody then
thought of changing this beautiful bird's plumage. Beside, variation
comes of itself, and it does not depend on the rearer's skill to bring
it about. It was quite by chance that a Green Budgerigar one day
produced a Yellow Budgerigar. It w~as probably raised first in Belgium
between 1875 and 1880, and for some time it was so rare that French
amateurs only knew of its existence by hearsay. In that very complete
work which E. Leroy published in 1883 on the Budgerigar, and in the
pamphlet by Alfred Bousse which appeared the following year on
Parrakeets, this author--who appears never to have handled nor even
seen the Yellow Budgerigar--only devotes a few brief lines to describing
its chief characteristics, and mentions that it was obtained in the North. 1
When the variety perpetuated itself it was received with great favour,
but not much surprise, because other green birds had sported yellow
individuals in captivity. 2
But on the contrary the creation of a Blue Budgerigar was received

J. Bailly-Maitre --
with equal admiration and astonishment. A coloured plate, which
was published in 1882 by " l'Acclimatation Xllustree " of Brussels,
enables us to form an exact idea of the new coloured plumage in which
this variety was first clad. The pair which are figured there differ
little from the type which we see now among more or less azure blue
specimens. The birds which served as models for this plate belonged
to M. Limbosch of Uccle (Belgium), who preserved the strain with
jealous care.
It was not until thirty years later, to our knowledge, that the Blue
Budgerigar was introduced into France ; and in any case it was not
until February, 1911, that it was produced and publicly shown in
Paris by Mme. Quentin de la Gueriniere. (The first Blue Budgerigar
displayed in the Natural History Museum was offered that year by
Mme. de la Gueriniere and presented to our colleagues of the Societe
d'Acclimatation at the sitting of the 4th December, 1911, by
Professor Huessart.) It seems superfluous to say that they were
considered exquisite, seeing that nowadays every amateur has the
opportunity of admiring this variety. But, if they excited general
admiration, the appearance of the Blue Budgerigar caused equally
great astonishment to all who asked themselves how the primitive
type was able to produce this new coloured plumage and change from
green to blue.
If two Budgerigars, one Green and the other Blue, are examined,
it will be observed that all those portions of the plumage (forehead,
throat, and edges of the streaks) which are yellow in the first, are
white in the second : consequently the Blue Budgerigar is the result
of the complete elimination of the yellow colouring from the plumage
of the original type, whose green parts are composed of a mixture
of yellow and blue colouring elements. 1
Having these three varieties--green, yellow, and blue--the breeders
of Budgerigars were in a position to create all the other varieties which
they have made known to us to the present time, and the number is
still increasing. All the intermediate colours between yellow and
green have been obtained, and the gradation of tints between them

is so slight that it has become very difficult to agree on the names
by which to call these new varieties. Besides this, very often these
shades are quite fugacious, and in many cases the moult brings them
back to the type whence they were derived.
By dimming the green colour Olive Budgerigars have been produced,
and this shade is now constant and very characteristic.
The great ambition of most Budgerigar breeders is to obtain a pure
white variety. It is by means of the Blue Budgerigar that they try
to secure a perfectly white one, and it must be allowed that some
individuals approach pretty nearly to the desired type.
It has been noticed ever since it first appeared that the Blue
Budgerigar has a wide range of colour between one individual and
another ; by the side of azure blue specimens there may be others
of more or less washed-out tinge, and on the contrary others so intensely
blue as to be quite cobalt. In our opinion this last shade reproduces
in the highest degree the characteristic plumage of the Blue Budgerigar ;
but, unluckily, few amateurs have endeavoured to preserve this,
and for the most part the palest specimens are selected with the object
of obtaining the white form. By this means they have succeeded
in producing some very colourless individuals, with whitish plumage,
if not actually white, and which have none of the original pencilling
on the upper part of the body, but the underneath is always more or
less blue and the large quills of the wings and tail still betray their
origin. 1 One may therefore doubt the likelihood of obtaining a white
Budgerigar by selecting always the palest blues ; dilution of colour
is not change of colour ; that can be fixed by selection in a few genera-
tions, but when one has to do with merely diluted colouring individuals
will always revert more or less to their ancestral tint.
There is no reason to suppose that a white race of Budgerigars
cannot be obtained, just as there are already yellow and blue ones ;
if it be admitted that it can be obtained through albinism. 2
1 In Mr. Astley's aviaries, which contain about fifty Green and Blue Budgerigars
together with birds of all kinds, a white one has appeared at two different times.
No special selection is carried out, and Yellows are hatched also from time to time.
2 Perfect albinism is quite exceptional among Green Parrots and Parrakeets.
The commonest form of colour change is " lutinism" either partial or complete.
" Bluing " is also met with at times, though more rarely. Mr. Ezra has an

Budgerigar Breeding in Toulouse
In the true White Budgerigar colouring matter will be altogether
lacking, and in consequence its eye will be red or unpigmented ; but
none such have yet been seen.
Still, a red-eyed form was obtained in Belgium more than forty
years ago : it was figured on the coloured plate which we spoke of
a propos of the Blue Budgerigar ; it is described under the name of
the Golden Budgerigar, and has uniformly yellow plumage, without
the least trace of pencilling on the upper parts of the body.
The colour of the pencilling has altered at the same time as the
plumage in all varieties which have as yet appeared, and so as to
harmonize with it. In the Greens the pencilling is very sharply drawn,
plain black edged with yellow ; in the Olives the pencilling takes a
bronze shade; in the Jade the black marks amalgamate with the
greenish yellow, the pencillings stands out less distinctly, and they
scarcely show at all in the Yellows, where they may even be completely
absent.
The pencilling of the Blue Budgerigar is grey ; fairly dark in the
deep blue individuals, they become lighter according as the blue
plumage fails and white spreads over the upper part of the body;
and they finish by shading into blue and even disappear where the colour
is so diluted as to approach white. The modification of colour through
which the pencilling of the Blue Budgerigar pass, allow of the realiza-
tion of a very handsome form, with azure blue plumage on which the
delicate pencillings of the same colour have a white background.
To this series of varieties, already so rich, which are known in the
Budgerigar, we must add the Mauve and the Grey, which M. Blanchard
has lately recorded . 1
Although they seem so strange and unexpected these two new
varieties in the plumage of Budgerigars is not inexplicable. In
fact, very complete study carried out on a certain number of animals,
shows that modification of colour is determined by the nature and
Alexandrine which is entirely blue and another which is all yellow. The Marquess
of Tavistock has in his collection of Alexandrine Parrakeets some which are all
yellow and Blossom-headed Parrakeets (P. rosa) with yellow spots. It has been
observed that females are much more liable to lutinism than males. They breed
freely, but up to the present have only produced green offspring.--N. D. L. R.

constitution of the colouring agents belonging to each species. Each
one of them bears the germ and possibility of future variation, so that
no colour can appear or be developed if it is not already contained :
it may be in combination or separate, in the fur or feather of the
typical individual.
Thus it can be explained how the Green Budgerigar, the colour of
whose plumage was made up of the fusion of the colouring elements
yellow and blue, is able to give rise to the yellow variety by the
disappearance of the blue colouring element on the one hand, and on
the other to the yellow variety by the suppression of the yellow colouring
matter. When we know that white results from the absence of
colouring matter, we can understand that it may appear in certain
parts of the Blue Budgerigar. We have also observed that the changes
in the coloration of the pencilling are allied to the changes of colour
in their edgings, and we have noted that, in the Blue Budgerigar, the
grey of the pencilling appeared at the same time that the bordering
has lost colour and become white. So the Grey Budgerigar could be
produced through the spreading to other parts of the plumage which
till then was localized in the pencilling of the Blue Budgerigar.
The arrival of the Lilac Budgerigar seems attributable to the same
factor, for the typical Green Budgerigar reveals by a simple examina-
tion of its plumage the existence of a mauve colour element. For
that matter I have always been surprised that all the authors who have
described the species have fallen into the same mistake of describing
the spot which adorns the cheeks of the Budgerigar as blue, it suffices
to look with a little attention at this mark to realize that it is far more
indigo, becoming more or less violet or mauve in the same degree as
the general tint of the plumage draws towards blue or yellow.
As a finish to the diversities which are to be noticed in the
Budgerigar, we may remark that, as a rule, the Yellows are the largest
and the Olives the smallest.

birds, and dividing those which Mrs. Astley was not able to keep
amongst our late President's avicultural friends, fell to the lot of
M. Delacour. He describes the splendid collection, which to the last
had been kept up to its high standard, as he found it. While several
of the rarities have been given to friends, Mrs. Astley will retain the
greater part of the collection and Brinsop Court will retain its present
features, and the birds will still fill in the picture of the beautiful
old mansion.
The following is quoted from M. Delacour's article:--*
" During the thirty years that Mr. Astley kept birds very many
extremely rare kinds lived in his aviaries ; one of our plates gives
a Blue-bellied Parrot ( Triclaria cyanogaster) from South-East Brazil,
an extremely rare bird, which lived many years in captivity and ended
its days in the Zoological Gardens of London. Mr. Astley possessed
many other Parrakeets, and was the first to breed the Queen Alexandra's
(Polytetis alexandrce) and the Golden-shouldered Parrakeets (Psephotus
dissimilis) ; he likewise bred Pileated Parrakeets (Porphyrocephalus
spurius), Stanleys, Many-colours, etc. He owned a Lear's Macaw,
a Pachynus brachyurus, a Microglossus, and Solitary Lories from Fiji,
along with other rarities.
" His collection of Doves was very good, also that of the Waterfowl ,
of these he kept for seven years Cotton Teal ( Nettapus ), and was the
only person to keep them alive so long. He had many waders, too,
particularly Agamia and Thinocorus, and obtained hybrids between
the Australian Ibis (I. spinicollis) and the Indian Black-headed Ibis
(I. melanocephala) . He always kept many Cranes, and a young
Australian Crane was reared at Brinsop in 1924.
" His cages and aviaries were always well filled with Passeres,
but only the rarest can be given here ; various Birds of Paradise,

Sugar-birds, and Humming-birds ; the Australian Blue Wren, several
kinds of Niltavas, Loo-Choo Bobins, Red-headed Himalayan Tits,
Yellow-headed Gouldian-Finches, Blue Drongos, Motmots, etc.
" He was the first in Europe to rear the Pink-breasted Grosbeak
and Orange-headed Thrush, and in his aviaries Shamas, Blue Robins,
American Robins, Crimson Finches, Cuban Colins, and others bred
freely.

By the Marquess of Tavistock
Few aspects of bird life are more interesting to study than the
" personal " element in the relationship between a male and female
that have mated and also between parents and their young. The
variation is amazing, not only in the conduct of birds of different
orders, but in the conduct of species belonging to the same genus and
even in the conduct of individuals of the same species. Careful study
of the subject indicates that birds are far from being mere automata,
influenced solely by heredity, instinct and environment.
It is not a little remarkable that birds, although regarded by
scientists as structurally very inferior to mammals, and although, like
them, descended from a polygamous ancestry, should in so many cases
have evolved a pure and strict monogamy which among mammals
is so rare as to be almost unknown. With the exception of the American
fox, no species of mammal is at present known with certainty to be
very strictly monogamous and to pair for life. Even man, with all his
boasted reason and moral sense and with science, religion, and
civilization to help him, is still, as a species , struggling along somewhere
about the level of the less reputable of the Ducks, having been badly
beaten in the race towards an ideal sexual relationship by most of
the Parrots, Cranes, and Swans. Even as a parent, the lord of creation
has little to boast of. It is true that he is in the habit of treating his
fully adult young with considerably more affection than is displayed,
even in the best of bird circles, but there his superiority, as a species,
ends. Take the percentage of Crane parents that are cruel and
neglectful towards their immature young and compare it with the
percentage of human parents--and where is man ? Even if it be argued
that man is far kinder than the birds in his treatment of the children
oTother members of his race, he is no better in this respect than the

cock Rhea and the domestic Gander, who are ready to adopt their
neighbours' orphans. The varied marriage customs of the Parrot
family are both interesting and amusing to observe. All Parrots are
naturally monogamous, and the great majority pair for life, but while
in some cases the hen is master of the establishment, in others the cock
controls the movements of the pair.
I have comparatively little experience of the typical Parrots or of
the Conures, but as far as my observations go male and female live
throughout the year on terms of affectionate equality, fondling one
another, playing with one another, and occasionally indulging in a
mild squabble. The same holds good with the Lories and Lorikeets
and most of the Cockatoos. The Black Cockatoos are somewhat different
in their behaviour towards each other. Fondling is unknown among
them, and the hen is always master. During the breeding season the
cock feeds her, but at other times of year she is inclined to be selfish
and short-tempered, clearing him unceremoniously out of her way,
especially at meal-times, though not objecting to him sitting close to
her when the pair are at rest. A strange male and female introduced
for the first time take comparatively little interest in each other, and
this indifference continues until the hen comes into breeding condition.
The different species of Palcernis Parrakeets vary somewhat as
regard the attitude of the sexes towards each other, but the ladies of
the family, as a whole, display a most shrewish disposition towards
their unhappy partners when not engaged in domestic duties and are
both willing and able to kill them in a confined space. The exception is
the Alexandrine Parrakeet, which is the mildest-tempered member of
the whole genus. While not showing any marked attachment outside
the breeding season, the sexes are usually quite good friends throughout
the year ; the same is true, but in a lesser degree, of the Plumhead ;
some hen Plumheads are quite kind to their husbands, others become
little vixens with the advent of the moult.
A hen Ringneck, not in breeding condition, usually gives a strange
cock a very unfriendly reception, and although she will not actually
kill him in a large aviary, will take good care that he is not anywhere
near her. In February her demeanour begins to undergo an amazing
change, and the hen-pecked mate at once responds, showing, it always

seems to me, a most Christian spirit of forgiveness towards his late
persecutor ! He squirms round her in his most attractive fashion,
rocking himself backwards and forwards and kissing the back of her
head, nibbling her toes and drawing her wing feathers through his
beak--familiarities which a few w^eeks before it would have been as much
as his life was worth to attempt! The lady receives all these attentions
with the greatest good humour and forbearance, and does not even
bite him, as a Rosella hen would do, when he pesters her with offers of
food after she has had enough. This happy state of affairs continues
until the children have left the nest. The hen tires of her offspring
some time before their father ceases to feed them. She starts to bite
them when they come near her, and soon afterwards begins to treat
her partner in the same way, though she seems not to dislike him quite
so much as she did before they were first married. I find that when I
give my cock Ringnecks their liberty they do not always return to their
former mates when spring comes round, but are disposed to select
fresh partners. I do not blame them in the least, and should do the
same if I were afflicted with a wife having a disposition like that of a
Ringneck hen ! It may be that in a wild state Ringnecks pair for the
season only. A pair of Malabars in my collection seem pretty sociable
throughout the year. The cock gives way to the hen, but on one occasion
he lost his temper owing to her persistent refusal to go to nest, and in the
rather serious scrimmage that ensued he came off victor.
I have not had much opportunity of observing the habits of pairs
of Crimson-wings at liberty owing to the unfortunate penchant of this
species for exploring chimneys which usually brings them to an
untimely end.
All the cocks I have had in aviaries have believed in the maxim :
" A woman, a dog, and a walnut-tree ;
The more you beat 'em the better they be ! "
and have kept their wives in a state of strict, not to say intense
subjection. They were also much addicted to promiscuous flirtations,
and I should consider it doubtful if the Crimson-wing in his native land
remains faithful to one partner for life. The cock Crimson-wing, on the
whole, appears to more advantage as a father than as a husband.
If his marriage be one of his own choice he will attend to the wants of

<bodyText confidence="0.999657666666667" page_id="56188738"  page_num="246" year="" vol="">
his family with much devotion, even restraining the natural inclination
to bite his wife so long as there is a danger of disturbing the young
family by the process. When his partner has been forced upon him by
an unsympathetic owner and he has been too occupied with brooding
over the charms of his neighbour's wives to be able to spare a thought
for his own offspring, he will still receive them kindly when they make
their appearance in the world, and will even show a like forbearance
towards all other young birds of his own and allied species, over a period
of several months.
The Crimson-wing's near ally, the King Parrakeet, believes in
keeping his wife in her place, but he is faithful to her as long as both
remain alive. A pair of Kings introduced at any time of year when not
actually in moult will show excitement and pleasure, and take to one
another, but if the hen is too forward in her advances she is likely to
receive a sharp bite to remind her to behave with ladylike modesty,
and it is often most amusing to see a hen who is fearfully taken with her
suitor's appearance, trying to control herself sufficiently to avoid
receiving a snub, painful both to her person and her mind !
In the case of Barraband's Parrakeet, it is the hen who is always
master and who decides where the pair shall go when both are at
liberty. The cock Barraband is most devoted to his mate once he has
actually paired with her, and will never leave her. Both parents feed
their young long after they have left the nest, and will usually give way
at the feeding dish to other young birds not their own offspring as
long as they show signs of obvious immaturity. Even unmated cocks
and hens show the same forbearance towards youngsters.
Cock Barrabands, at any rate in some cases, show a remarkable
recognition of each other's rights in matrimonial matters. Some
years ago I had two cocks unmated, an old and a young one, the former
being the master. When I obtained a hen I used to put her out on
the verandah in her cage on fine days, the cocks being at liberty during
the daytime and shut up in an aviary at night. The young cock was
the first to discover the female, and at once began to pay his addresses
to her, his attentions being very well received : after some days I
introduced the old cock to the hen during the younger bird's temporary
absence. The old cock was equally attentive to her and she, I regret,

to say, was as responsive to him as to her first suitor. Before long,
however, the latter appeared on the scene, not best pleased with the
turn events had taken. I expected a squabble in which the young bird
would be worsted, but to my surprise the old fellow gave way to him
with hardly any resistance at all and left him with the lady, obviously
recognizing that he had a prior claim. Yet the same evening when
the hen had been taken indoors and the two cocks were alone in the
aviary, the old one was master as before. I tried the experiment several
times and always with the same result. The old cock would court
the hen with great energy until the young one turned up and then
immediately cleared out, but when he and the other male were about
together the young bird gave way to him. In the end I paired the
hen to the old cock, shutting the two up in the same aviary, and very
soon the young cock recognized that his suit was hopeless and when
they were again all together he gave way to the old bird on all occasions.
Eventually I was able to console him with a mate of his own.
In the case of Rock Peplars the hen is master, but the cock not
infrequently asserts himself during the breeding season and if he
suspects his mate of neglecting her domestic duties drives her home to
the nest with bites and abuse. I have a cock Rock Peplar paired to
a Crimson-winged Parrakeet whom he is not powerful enough to
discipline in the way he might do a mate of his own species. If the
Crimson-wing appears to him to be neglecting her log, he dare not
bite her, but makes up for it by continual nagging, following her about
whining and grumbling and flapping his wings (a Rock Peplar's way of
showing anger) until he so gets on her nerves that for the sake of peace
she gives way to his wishes ! Rock Peplars are good parents and both
sexes feed the young long after they have left the nest, and give way
to them for many weeks after they have ceased to feed them.
I have not owned a sufficient number of Queen Alexandra Parrakeets
to be able to say with certainty what are the relations between the
sexes. As a rule male and female seem to show little regard for each
other outside the breeding season, and the female is usually master.
They certainly do not seem anything like so attached to one another
as Barrabands.
The Broad-tailed Parrakeets are in many ways a great contrast

to the Polyteline. With Broad-tails the cock is very much master,
and decides the movements of the pair when at liberty. During the
breeding season he allows his wife a certain amount of licence, and
permits her to pretend to bite him when he gets in her way, but she
knows very well that she must not presume too far and keeps out of
her mate's reach if anything happens to upset his always rather
irascible temper. The cock Broad-tail is, in fact, a gentleman of the
old school. In many ways he is a faithful and devoted husband
and is much concerned at the loss of his wife at any time of year.
But he is also proud, jealous, and peppery. When the hen is first
introduced to him he expects her to show a becoming degree of modesty,
and woe betide her if she allows herself to appear too forward and
demonstrative. If he suspects her (often on the slenderest grounds)
of encouraging a rival he can be very spiteful, and if he is convinced
of wilful desertion he can be perfectly murderous. I once had a cock
Barnard whose hen was liable to egg-binding, and whenever she was
returned to the aviary after being taken into hospital for treatment
it was necessary to drive the cock out and keep him out for some days,
for he was furious and for at least forty-eight hours was bent on killing
her. It was not simply that he mistook her for a new hen, for his
behaviour towards a stranger, though very unfriendly, was entirely
different. Broad-tails get tired of their young and drive them off
a few weeks after they have left the nest, the hens being the first to
turn them adrift. In the rare cases when, in captivity, the hen of a pair
of Broad-tails proves to be the master there is little prospect of a
successful marriage. The cock fears and often dislikes his too masculine
companion, and lack of proper discipline has a most pernicious effect
on the character of the lady who becomes more and more unfeminine
in her actions and demeanour.
The Psephoti have much the same marriage customs as the larger
Broad-tails, although the cocks are, on the whole, on more intimate
terms with their mates, sometimes preening their heads and rarely
provoked by any contretemps into inflicting punishment upon them.
They tire quickly of their young when the latter have left the nest.
Among Bluebonnets the cocks rule the roost, but they are on
very intimate terms with their mates with whom they sometimes

play like Lorikeets. Trie curious aberrant Red-capped Parrakeet
(Porphyrocephalus spmius) appears to live on friendly terms with
his mate throughout the year, and like the true Broad-tails feeds
her when she is sitting.
In the case of the Blue-winged Grass Parrakeet (Neophema venusta ),
and probably also of its near allies, the hen is very decidedly master,
and keeps her husband well in subjection, treating him in the severest
manner if she suspects another lady of taking too great an interest
in him. The parents seem to stay with their full-fledged young longer
than the. Broad-tails, possibly because they are single brooded. With
Budgerigars, as is generally known, the hens also are the stronger
sex, and depraved individuals have been known to go so far as to murder
their partners. The cock Budgerigar sometimes pairs for life, but he
is decidedly fickle and his affections are easily diverted when his wife
is not in breeding condition, nor under these circumstances does she
seem to worry if he goes off with a fresh companion. As is usual
among Parrakeets, the cock tires of his family less soon than the mother,
and feeds them for a longer period, although it cannot be said that even
he is in favour of coddling children old enough to take care of
themselves.
In the case of the true Lovebirds and Parrotlets the hens are
mistresses of the situation. The sexes seem very faithful and pair
for life, exhibiting a great deal of affection, but also, on the principle
" amantium irae amoris integratio est " indulging in fairly lively
squabbles from time to time.

At times a solitary Knorhaan would be seen flying with measured
wing beats over the scrub. The Knorhaans are large birds of the
Bustard family, and are fairly common all over South Africa.
In the sandy wastes of Bechuanaland flocks of Sand Grouse were
disturbed by the passing of the train. After running a few yards
they flew far away with their swift, pigeon-like flight.
By the sides of streams and rivers one often saw small parties
of the White-bellied Stork (Abdimia ahdimi), a short, thick-set bird
much shorter than the familiar White Stork, and in carriage resembling
an ibis rather than a Stork. These birds are very familiar objects in
Rhodesia, associating in great flocks and frequenting the cultivated
lands in search of insects, especially locusts. The name given to this
bird by the Rhodesians is the Black-locust Bird. Its great economic
value is universally recognized. The plumage is glossy black with
a broad white band which crosses the lower abdomen.
At one of the stations en route was a tame Brown-necked Parrot.
These Parrots, I understand, live in the interior of Bechuanaland
m
and also, of course, further up north.
Rollers were extremely plentiful, occupying conspicuous places
by the side of the railway, but of these beautiful birds I shall have
more to say later on.
At one little siding, amongst other zoological treasures brought
by the natives for sale was a nest of four baby Moselikatze's Rollers
(Coracias caudatus) in perfect health and plumage. How I longed
to buy them, but as I had three more days to go in the train it was
quite impossible.
A few miles from Gwelo, which is between Bulawayo and Salisbury,
on a flat-topped tree by the side of the railway, was a Secretary Bird's
nest with both birds standing in it, so I should think that they
evidently had young ones.
Imagine my joy upon arriving at my destination to find it a perfect
avian Eldorado ; everywhere were crowds of birds ; flocks of snow-
white Egrets, gay Bee-eaters, Rollers, and jewelled Sunbirds, and
around my hut were crowds of Waxbills, divers Finches, Flycatchers,
etc. What happy anticipations I had of spending nearly two years
amongst such a host of feathered friends !

I remember seeing some years ago in Hamlyn's a large cage full
of grey birds, and being little more than a child at the time I had no
idea of what they were, but they looked fascinating, and on asking
I was informed that they were Grey Turacos (Schizorhis concolor).
Strange to say, these were the first birds that I saw and heard in
Rhodesia. The Grey Turaco is a bird that the proverbial blind man
in a dark room could hardly miss. It is a large bird, about two feet
in length, uniformly a smoky grey in colour. The tail is long and the
whole plumage of a very light soft texture. The head has a full crest
of decomposed feathers. The beak is thick, short, and slightly
hooked.
These Turacos consort together in small flocks of from six to twelve,
and frequent the well-wooded districts, feeding upon the wild fruit
and berries. They seem to glide from tree to tree with a remarkably
graceful and easy undulating flight, jerking their tails up and down
upon alighting. They are extremely noisy birds and their chatter is
incessant, but the most remarkable thing is the call-note,, which is
" Go-away ", repeated several times, and from which it derives its
African name the " Go-away Bird ". The call is wonderfully distinct,
clear, and resonant, and can be heard from quite a long distance,
and when once heard can never be forgotten.
In the winter-time, when the fruit is ripe these birds visit orchards
and feed upon the fruit, especially upon guavas. The nest is said
to resemble a pigeon's and also the eggs.
There are several different species of Turacos that inhabit Rhodesia.
One that comes from the eastern part of Rhodesia, inhabiting dense
forests on the borders of Portuguese East Africa, is of extreme beauty,
namely the Purple-crested Turaco (Gallirex porphyreoloplius), but the
Grey Turaco is the only one that I have personally observed. Of
the lovely family of Rollers Rhodesia can boast of many examples
of these super birds, but only -three have come under my observation--
the well-known European Roller (Coracias garrulus), the Moselikatze's
Roller (Coracias caudatus), and the rarer Racquet-tailed Roller (Coracias
spatuiatus). Of the former there is very little to say, as it is so well
known and was bred in the days before I was born by a member of
the Avicultural Society. It is exceedingly abundant in Rhodesia

in the summer months, but leaves at the beginning of the winter
(April). Around Salisbury its favourite perch is on the telegraph
wires, where it can be seen in the same numbers as the Swallows in
England before the migration.
The second bird named after the famous Zulu chief Moselikatze
(pronounced " Umsilikars "), is the most noticeable of the three, and
when in flight there are two very pronounced features, namely the
beautiful lilac-pink bloom about the chest and the long pointed outer
tail-feathers. This bird is rather shy, and will not allow such close
observation as will the European species. Its favourite perch is on
the topmost branch of a dead tree, from which it sails forth at frequent
intervals to capture winged insects. I have often seen it stated that
Rollers feed exclusively on insects captured on the wing, but from
my observation this seems to be rather erroneous, because I have
many times seen them searching for insects upon the ground, especially
locusts and grasshoppers. In common with the rest, of the family
these birds feed upon lizards, young snakes, also the eggs and young
of smaller birds. Some years ago there was a coloured plate of this
handsome bird in the Avicultural Magazine.
The Racquet-tailed Roller is occasionally seen but is not nearly
as numerous as the previous two, and can easily be distinguished by the
long spatule tail, and it is altogether of a more general pale blue.
In Rhodesia there are several kinds of soil--red soil, sand veldt,
contact, and black soil, etc.--and it is a very noticeable feature that
different species of birds are partial to the different kinds of soil, the
Rollers seem particularly attached to the sand veldt. The reason
for this I have been unable to find, except that it may be more con-
ducive to the insects upon which they feed.
In the whole of South Africa the family of Coraciidse are known
as Blue Jays.
The gem of all the river birds is certainly the Malachite Kingfisher
[Coryihornis cyanostigma )--a tiny gem only about half the size of the
English Kingfisher. The whole upper portion of the body rich
ultramarine blue shaded with violet, the throat white, and the under
parts bright chestnut. There is a fan-shaped crest which is not notice-
able, except when the bird is sitting on some branch overhanging

the water in a state of relaxation. The feathers of which it is composed
are narrow and alternately banded with black and bright blue. The
extraordinary long bill, which seems almost as long as the bird itself,
is bright coral red, which is also the colour of the diminutive feet.
Sitting by the beautiful Umsuru River in the heat of the day under
the welcome shade of a mimosa-tree, one sees in the sunlight on the
water what seems to be flashes of brilliant violet and red : it is this
tiny Kingfisher flying at an incredible speed over the surface of the
water taking fish to his hungry brood in the nest burrowed out in some
high sand bank higher up the river. In fact the flight is so swift that
the unobservant eye never notices it at all. Sometimes he will rest
awhile on a twig just over the water and preen his feathers or gaze
awhile at his reflection in the dark mirror beneath.
What happy days those in that paradise of sylvan beauty : the
slow-moving dark river in some places nearly covered by the pale blue
fragrant lotus lilies, the edges fringed by tall green reeds and giant
mimosa and a dozen kinds of other trees whose branches nearly touch
the water. The bright green water-snakes gliding with scarcely a
ripple over the water, and sometimes the sinister figure of a crocodile
floating downstream looking like a log of wood except for the cold
cruel eyes. I would that I could paint with my pen a picture that
would convey to the mind the beauties of that river, but alas ! my
literary capacity is limited, as these notes show. But there is the home
of a hundred and one brilliant birds--Bee-eaters, Rollers, Pittas,
Kingfishers, Woodpeckers, Turacos, Whydahs, Weavers, etc.--the
place where they live their lives undisturbed by man. Would that
it could always be so, but in a few years' time, as the progress of civiliza-
tion advances, the trees will be cut down to feed the fires of the tobacco
barns, the fertile soil ploughed up for mealies, cotton, or tobacco,
and the birds too will be gone. I hope I never return then.
To return to our subject, the Malachite Kingfisher inhabits the
whole of South Africa and is fairly common by all rivers, streams,
and ponds, feeding almost exclusively on small fish which it captures
by diving under the water. The nest is at the end of a narrow tunnel
excavated by the birds in a bank. The tunnel varies from eighteen
to twenty-four inches in length and one and a half inches in diameter.
The eggs are white, five to six in number, and are very thin-shelled.

Sydney Porter--Notes from Bhodesia
Occasionally on the sand veldt one sees several members of the
genus Halcyon, or Bush Kingfishers. These birds differ in many
ways from the other members of the family of the Alcedinidse ; in
the first place they inhabit the dry, partially-wooded bush veldt,
spending most of their time in the tall trees, but usually there is a river
in the vicinity, perhaps within half a mile or so, and secondly their
diet is less an exclusively fish one. They subsist mainly upon insects
such as grasshoppers, locusts, etc.
The two species that I have observed at close proximity are the
Striped Kingfisher (Halcyon chelicuti) and the Brown-hooded King-
fisher (Halcyon albiventris ). The former is rather a drab-coloured
bird for a Kingfisher, being of an ashy-grey colour on the head and
breast striped with narrow longitudinal streaks of black. The wings
are a pale greenish-blue and the tail and lower back the usual King-
fisher blue. The Brown-hooded Kingfisher is a much more handsome
bird. The head is similarly coloured to the preceding. The neck is
whitish, the feathers streaked in a like manner to the head. The
wings bright blue, the primary coverts tipped with black, the mantle
and lesser wing-coverts rich black, the lower back, rump, and tail
bright cobalt blue. The chin and throat white, and the breast rufous.
Beak red, tipped with black, and the legs also red. The female differs
in having the upper parts dark brown instead of black.
The Bush Kingfishers are timid and wild, but if one has great
patience and carefully and quietly follows these birds up they can
be watched at pretty close quarters for a considerable length of time.
Their large soft brown eyes are in constant motion and at the least
sign of danger there is a flash of blue and they are gone.
These birds inhabit the temperate regions of South Africa, seeming
not to wander much further north than the Zambesi Valley. They
are said to frequent the vicinity of the homesteads, but this has never
been my experience.
The nest, as is usual with all Kingfishers, is at the end of a fairly
long tunnel in a high bank ; sometimes the tunnel is as long as 4 feet.
Sometimes when lazing by the dreamy river a loud piping, but
rather melodious whistle would bring one to the land of reality. It is
the call-note of the Pied Kingfisher (Ceryle rudis), a handsome fellow,

though he boasts of no brilliant colours like most other members of
the family. His plumage, as his name implies, is black and white
arranged-in such a fashion as to render an accurate description rather
tedious, but the upper parts have a general speckled appearance
and the under parts white, the male having a black band across the
chest, which is lacking in the female. The head in both sexes is crested.
The long beak and feet are glossy black. The flight is swift but not to
be compared-with the arrow-like flight of the Malachite.
A pair of these birds I had under observation for a considerable
period. They had a nest in a high bank of a little bay in the river :
it was in a very conspicuous position, but almost impregnable, for the
bank rose sheer out of a deep still pool that the swirling water of
flood-time had cut out. The earth was so hard that it was almost
impossible to chip it with a penknife, so how the birds managed to
bore their burrow to over a depth of 3 feet is rather a mystery,
unless it was done in the rainy season when the earth was soft and moist.
The hole was about 4 inches in diameter, and the bottom half to
the depth of about half an inch was filled with wet mud of quite a
different composition to the surrounding earth. The fish bones of which
the nest was composed were almost like crumbled rich paper, quite
clean and wholesome.
These two birds, the owners of the nest in question, seemed to
show a great affection for each other, both perching on the same branch
overhanging the water. The cock would sidle up to his mate with
crest erected, looking at her with many loving glances, preening her
feathers, and talking to her the while in a sweet warbling undertone.
The mode of fishing of the Pied Kingfisher differs from that of
most Kingfishers. It poises itself in the air over the water with almost
motionless outspread wings and drops down into the water on to its
prey, which consists mainly of small fish. Its mode of bathing is
peculiar too, and resembles that of the Swallows, dashing along the
surface like a half-submerged submarine.
Sometimes these birds migrate from one river to another, flying
high in the air but unmistakable owing to the great length of the
beak, which seems quite out of proportion with the rest of the body.
There was a sad sequel to the happy existence of our little pied

friends. One night there was a terrific storm and the river came down
in flood, flowing in a raging torrent high above the nest in which the
whole family met their doom.

PRICES: THEN AND NOW
By Dr. E. Hopkinson, C.M.G., D.S.O.
From about 1894 to 1900, when hopes were higher and keenness
greater, I kept a record of advertised prices of birds. Having just come
across this old record, I think it may serve for an article of some interest
for comparison with present prices and opportunities--both as regards
most species, how much greater than in the " good old days ", " good "
from a pecuniary point of view in this connexion, but rather older than
I care to think about. This list will provide the " then " of the heading,
the u now " (1924-5) can be got every week in Cage Birds, or monthly
elsewhere. For comparison I have noted and added a few prices
recently advertised.
The list is more or less alphabetical and the names used are mostly
those of the original list, and these, in spite of the continual chops and
changes, will, I think, be recognizable.
Alpine Accentor. --Fairly commonly advertised by Maschke, of
Islington, 10s. a pair to 10s. each.
Aurora Finch. --Sporadically imported, 20s. to 7s. 6d. a pair.
Amadine Finch (= Bib Finch).--7s. 6 d. to 5s. 6 d. a pair.
Avadavat.-- 3s. 6d. to Is. 3 d. a pair, and even 10s. a dozen. Cheapest
usually from July to October. Extra fine ones in colour sometimes
5s. 6d. to 6s. 6 d. a pair.
Alario Finch. --Only two entries. Cocks 7s. 6 d. each.
Bengalese. --7s. 6d. to 4s. 6d. a pair. All white ones rather dearer,
10s. to 7s. a pair.
Bicheno Finches. --50s. to 16s. 6 d. a pair, and once 12s. 6 d., but
these I remember were a particularly seedy lot.
Blue Grosbeaks.--O ccasional; average 30s. a pair.

E. Hopkinson--Prices : Then and Now
Nonpareil. --12s. 6 d. to 6s. 6d. each. Only cocks imported and they
came over with Indigos in the cages (each bird separate) in which
the Hartz Canaries had been taken to America. Recent advertise-
ments give 25s. each as the price.
Pintail Nonpareil. --Sporadic, 40s. to 20s. 6d. a pair, with one
fall to 12s. 6 d. and 10s. a pair. The odd sixpence in such prices as
20s. 6d., 200s. 6d., will perhaps recall to the more mature the particular
dealer who made almost a speciality of this little supplement.
Nunns and Mannikins. --Chocolate Mannikins, 3s. to 2s. a pair,
10s. a dozen ; 6s. a pair the present price. Tricolour Mannikins, 8s.

Military Troupials averaged from 10s. to 6s. each, with one advertise-

Sir, --Aviculturists, particularly those with large collections,
sometimes have birds which are rather in the nature of wdiite elephants,
being unattractive to their owners and their owners' friends and worth
very little in the market. I wonder if members realize that, in Great
Britain at any rate, such birds can be disposed of in a way which
gives an enormous amount of pleasure to people less fortunate than
ourselves and insures a happy home for the birds where they will be
cherished as though they were the greatest rarities ?
All that is necessary is to write a letter to the weekly paper Cage
Birds , offering the bird to a good home and giving a brief description
of its appearance, requirements, and outstanding virtues and vices.
No matter how common, plainly coloured, or even defective and injured
the specimen for disposal may be, the letter will evoke a perfect sheaf
of applications. If, however, the stipulation is made that no prepaid
telegrams or stamped envelopes be sent, and no replies be expected
from unsuccessful claimants, the trouble of looking through the
correspondence and picking out the most suitable application is not
really great. When disposing of surplus stock in this way I have been
both astonished and touched to discover the enormous number of
people there are in the world, including children, cripples, and disabled
ex-Service hien, who simply long to have a bird of some kind as a pet,
but are unable to afford to buy one. Many applications are also
received from people who already keep a few birds and are obviously
experienced in attending to them. Canaries and British birds are
accepted as eagerly as others. Tavistock.

THE BEAUTIFUL SPREO

<bodyText confidence="0.995399" page_id="56188759"  page_num="263" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I think it may perhaps interest the readers of the Avicultural
Magazine to know that I kept the " Beautiful Spreo " (Spreo pulcher)
some years before the War, as you consider him to be new to English
aviculture. I had some of these interesting birds that I kept in large
cages or all together in a large aviary. They did not breed with me,
though, I suppose, I had cocks and hens at a time, perhaps because
I had too many birds in the aviary. Some time before the War
I acquired a fine cock at Bordeaux. He is still living and well. I con-
sider him as being a very hardy bird, as I have wintered him out of

doors these last yfears, which have been very wet in this country.
In 1921, M. Delacour bought a hen, and I sent him my cock to pair with
her. The hen laid fertile eggs in a log and incubated them, but they
did not hatch out. She died of a chill in the autumn, and the cock,
who had also been taken ill, was sent back to me. I kept him in a
warm room all the winter, coughing and breathing heavily. He
recovered, however, and is now in good condition ; I think he would
breed, in spite of his old age, if I were fortunate enough to get a mate
for him. Though not so brilliant as the other Glossy Starlings, he is,
in my opinion, one of the finest of his tribe. The finest of all is certainly
the Cosmopsarus regius. I think I was the first in Europe to keep
this species in captivity, for I bought the first pair that reached
Marseilles in January, 1924. The species is not so robust as the other
Glossy Starlings, and is very sensitive to cold and wet.
I have not been very lucky with my birds this year. I have lost
some valuable birds and so far have not bred many young. The Blue
Robins (Sialia sialis) and the Shamas have young out of the nest,
and some Australian Finches, Doves and Parrakeets have bred, too.

A LUTINO BLUE-FRONTED AMAZON
Sir, --By the kindness of Mr. P. Castang, I was able, some weeks
ago, to obtain a very beautiful Lutino Amazon Parrot--the only one
I have ever seen. When first I heard of the bird, I was somewhat
suspicious of its genuineness, recalling tales of South American Parrots
doctored with a preparation which produces a growth of yellow feathers.
Mr. Seth-Smith, however, was good enough to have a look at the bird
for me and pronounced it a true Lutino, as it certainly is.
Its plumage may be best described by saying that all those areas
which are green in a normal Blue-front are a lovely deep golden
yellow, all the blue areas are white, and all the red of the normal
plumage is retained. The eye is pink and the beak and feet cream
colour. The bird is quite tame and in excellent health, though deep
in moult. If the fates are kind I hope to show it later in the year,
and I think it will take some beating !
Being a Lutino and an Amazon, it is almost certain to be a female.
Miss Knobel has been good enough to send me a member of the opposite
sex which is so strangely rare in confinement, and the year after next
I shall hope to induce the pair to breed. Tavistock.

BREEDING THE GARRULOUS HONEY-EATER
(MYZANTHA GARRULA)

The Garrulous Honey-eater appears to be a rather rarely imported
species. It is of sober plumage, but is, nevertheless, quite a handsome
bird. The following is a brief description of the adult: Grey, darker on
upper surface, narrowly barred on back of neck and breast; crown,
\0x25A0ear coverts, and V-shaped mark on throat, black ; naked patch behind
\0x25A0eye, yellow; forehead white.; wings brown, with distinct tinge of
green in certain lights ; tail, brown with dirty white tips to most of
the feathers ; bill and feet, yellow. The female is slightly smaller than
the male, but similar in plumage. Size about that of the Starling. An
illustration appeared in the Avicultural Magazine for August, 1924.
These birds are very easy to cater for in captivity; they thrive
on milksop and a few mealworms. They will also eat a little inseetite
food and fruit occasionally.
They are restless and noisy, and their voices can be heard at a great
distance. Although not quarrelsome, they would probably be dangerous
to small birds when nesting. They are not fond of bathing.
My birds, which were obtained in February of the present year, were

the enclosure, they commenced to gather dry grass into three or four
shapeless heaps in the bushes. These accumulations were added to

266 W. E. Suggitt--Breeding the Garrulous Honey-eater
of them bore the slightest resemblance to a nest I began to lose a good
deal of interest in the proceedings. One day, however (15th June),
on entering the shelter shed rather suddenly I flushed one of the birds
out of a small round basket, fixed on the wall, about 7 feet from the
floor. The basket contained a compactly built nest, about the size of
that of the Song Thrush, but with a shallower cavity. The nest was
built of coarse grass with a lining of very fine pieces of the same
material. It contained one egg, white with a warm pink tint, and with
large spots of bright red,, fairly evenly distributed, but slightly more
numerous at the large end.
The hen apparently missed laying on 16th June, on the 17th there
were two eggs. Incubation commenced with the laying of the first egg.
It is almost impossible to ascertain whether incubation is shared by
both sexes. The slightly smaller size and slenderer bill of the female
are not perceptible unless the birds are closely compared, and I could
never catch one of them relieving the other on the nest.
The din made by both birds when anyone went near the nest was
appalling. Their voices, when raised in protest, were like the noise made
by the squeaker in an indiarubber toy, but incomparably louder, and
if any attempt was made to examine the nest they would go one better
and give vent to ear-splitting screams.
I did not care to run the risk of the birds deserting their nest on
account of too much interference, and only made occasional furtive
inspections with the aid of a hand mirror. On 26th June one of the
eggs had disappeared ; the remaining one hatched on the 30th, when
a hasty peep with the mirror revealed a dark-skinned squab.
I gave them a liberal supply of small mealworms, three or four times
daily, in addition to spiders and other live food that I was able to
collect; blow-fly pupae were also provided, but these the old birds would
scarcely touch. When there were no mealworms or spiders available
milksop was freely given to the nestling.
On this diet the youngster made splendid headway, its constantly
repeated food cry of whit whit growing stronger every day. On the
morning of 16th July it was sitting on the edge of the basket, fully
fledged, and in the afternoon it had taken up a perch on a branch--a
strong perky little fellow.

Early in August the young one was able to fend for itself, but it
continued to follow- its parents about for food until it was over ten
weeks old.
Towards the end of July a second nest was built in a thick privet
bush. Three eggs were laid on successive days, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th August.
Incubation commenced as before, with the laying of the first egg. From
this nest I had hoped to get a fuller description of the nestlings and their
development, but unfortunately all three eggs proved to be infertile.
The young bird is now caged separately. It resembles the adults,
except for a few minor differences ; the barring is not quite so distinct,
the naked patch of skin behind the eye is dirty white instead of yellow,
and the bill and feet are darker.

(Continued from, p. 256)
There is one bird that frequents the environs of The Homesteads,
and which is occasionally seen in the wooded parts by the rivers,
that is of surpassing beauty--the Scarlet-chested Sunbird (Ginnyris
gutturalis). I am sure that it can put some of the humming- birds
in the shade as far as beauty is concerned. It is one of the largest of
the Sun birds, about the size of a Great Tit, but of a more slender build.
As one sees these beautiful creatures in the trees they appear to be
black, not a sombre black but an intense velvety black with a rich
maroon tinge; but when the bird turns and faces one there is a flash
of brilliant, fiery, ruby red, and the whole breast appears like a glowing
ember. On closer examination it will be found that the wings and
tail are of maroon-brown, the forehead and crown brilliant metallic
bronze-green, also the upper part of the throat and two moustache-like
lines at the base of the beak ; the breast feathers, which at a distance
appear-to be intense ruby red, are really metallic pale blue tipped with
the former colour. The blue is only seen when the bird is handled,
when one observes the beautiful effect of the blue shining through the
red. After death or after the bird has been in captivity for a little
time the colours lose their intensity. The shoulders are a pale metallic

bronze-purple. The long curved beak and feet are black. The hen is
a mouse colour, with black marking about the face.
They flit and hover around the flowers, inserting their long slender
beaks into the cups, sucking up the nectar and minute insects with
their hair-like tongue. I have often wanted to make an examination
of the crop to ascertain exactly what food they really did subsist upon,
but I could never bring myself to shoot one. One would be lacking
in feeling, I think, to extinguish the tiny flame that animated such a
glorious exterior. I have sometimes seen these Sunbirds catching
flies after the manner of a Flycatcher and also hovering in the air after
the manner of a Humming Bird under the eaves of the farm buildings
searching for spiders, etc. In the garden was an old thatched pagoda
covered with climbing plants ; this was the favourite resort of Sunbirds,
who spent most of their time minutely examining the foliage for insects.
The nest is a beautiful structure, pear-shaped and about 8 inches
long and 5 in diameter, composed of cotton wool and various
vegetable downs stuck all over with tiny pieces of bark, lichen, and
skeleton leaves, and bound together by spiders' webs; the inside
is lined with the softest down, the whole is securely fastened to the end
of a slender branch of a tall tree and swings like a pendulum in the
slightest breeze.
I have a nest composed of vegetable down and covered with pieces
of fine lace and embroidery.
The female alone seems to feed the young, though no doubt the
males assist at times. I often wonder if this bird is polygamous, for
one usually sees several females in the company of one male.
One day I found the little boy of the house with a young Sunbird
of this species which a native had taken from a nest near by ; he was
trying to rear it on breadcrumbs, and had placed it in an old Weaver
bird's-nest in the bush, but fortunately this method of rearing only
dated from a few hours previously, and when I rescued it it was just a
tiny atom, naked and shivering, apparently only a day or two old. I took
the nest, lined it with cotton wool, and fixed it firmly into a cardboard
box. The lining I changed at frequent intervals during the day. I fed
the youngster at intervals of about fifteen minutes from dawn to dusk,
that is from about 4.30 a.m. to 6.30 p.m., on a syrupy paste of partly

boiled egg, powdered biscuits and flies, the latter from the kitchen,
which swarmed with them. At intervals between the paste feed I gave
a syrup of diluted milk, sugar and squashed flies from the end of a
quill into which the little bird would insert its beak and greedily suck
up the liquid with the aid of its slender tongue. I also gave small
insects whole, such as spiders, etc.
Everything went well, and the young bird throve apace, the pin
feathers appeared, and in time the whole body was beautifully feathered,
the colour was quite different from either of the parents, the back was
mottled olive-brown and yellow, the breast bright yellow with brown
markings at the sides.
In time it grew to anticipate my coming, and would climb on to
the edge of the nest, making a peculiar whistling sound. It grew
stronger every day, and would sit preening its feathers on the edge
of the box that the nest was in; in fact my hopes of rearing it ran high,
and I sent for a portrait attachment to my camera that I might be
able to take its photograph, but it arrived a day too late. Now comes
the sad ending, which is all the more disappointing because it was
through my own carelessness--imagine my horror one day after feeding
the Sunbird and placing it on the table in my room, on returning and
finding one of my pet Crows playing with a tiny yellow and brown
wing, all that was left of my charming little pet.
I had another Sunbird of the same species, an adult male in perfect
plumage but with a broken wing. I had it for a day or two but it died
in the end, for I think it must have had some internal injuries.
Some cynic once said of Africa that it was the land where men
know not honour, the women virtue, and the birds song ; he must
have been a cynic or one of those unfortunate persons who if they
see any bad anywhere lack the faculty of discerning the good: those
kind of people who meet an objectionable individual of some other
nationality than their own and straightway condemn the whole nation,
or if they hear one raucous voice in the chorus of birds' songs can
hear none of the sweet notes.
Of the first two cynical assertions this is hardly the place to discuss
them even if I were in a position to do so. Our disappointed friend
could certainly never have heard the liquid notes of the Bulbuls as

Sydney Porter--Notes from Rhodesia
the golden dawn stole across the sky, or the beautifully sweet song
of the little Black-throated Seed-eater and a dozen others whose voices
swell the joyous chorus that each day welcomes the rising sun.
The little Black-throated Seed-eater ( Serinus angolensis) has
one of the sweetest songs of any of the birds that I have come across
in Rhodesia. It is a small bird about the same size as a Redpoll,
very similar to it in colour except that the lower back is bright yellow,
which is only seen when the bird is in flight; the throat is black and
there are also black markings on the face. The male, female, and
young are all the same in plumage. It is never found far from the
homesteads and is of a comparatively confiding nature.
The nest is a frail structure looking more like that of a Humming
Bird than that of a Finch, and is placed or rather woven between some
slender forked branches of a fruit-tree. This little bird seems to show
a partiality for peach orchards. The eggs are two or three in number,
seldom more, white finely spotted with chestnut; the young when
feathered are exact replicas of their parents, and seem to leave
the nest in an incredibly short time after they are hatched.
Their food consists mainly of grass seed. I have frequently seen
them alight on the flowering grasses and feed upon the seed after the
manner of a Waxbill.
One of the commonest birds in Rhodesia, certainly the commonest
Weaver, is the Cabanis Weaver Bird (Hyphantornis cabanisi), which
in common with all Weavers, Whydahs, etc., goes under the designation
of " Fink ". In colour and size it superficially resembles the well-known
Baya Weaver of India, being of a brilliant golden yellow, the face and
throat being dark rich brown, almost black ; the wings, tail, and back,
olive, each feather edged with yellow.
There are three unique things about this bird : the first is the
brilliancy of the female, who is as highly coloured as her mate, but
lacks the dark face ; and the second that the young are as brightly
coloured as their parents but, as in the female, lack the dark face;
the third is the unique position in which the nest is placed, which in
itself is a beautiful piece of work, being of an almost round shape,
woven so well that it resembles basket work, and is lined with the
unripe downy flowering heads of ropoka grass ; the nest is always

woven of green grass, which of course dries after a time; it is placed
without exception at the extreme end of a slender branch from which
all the leaves have been stripped with the exception of the end two,
which are woven into the nest, either directly overhanging the water,
especially over rivers which renders it quite inaccessible, or in the
immediate vicinity of a hornet's nest, so that it is almost impossible
to tamper with the nest without getting stung, and a hornet's sting,
I may say for the benefit of those unacquainted with it, is no joke.
The eggs are from three to six in number, white finely spotted
with red.
The song is the kind typical to the family, harsh and rasping.
Near the homestead was a fowl pen in which was a plantation of
young m'sarsa-trees about 20 feet high, and in these roosted a
flock of Cabanis Weavers in company with other Finches, and the
noise made by these birds singing in unison was incredible ; the females
sang with equal gusto, and it was amazing the amount of energy that
the birds put into this morning and evening song. If one was under
the trees during this chorus it was impossible to hear oneself speak.
The superbly coloured Northern or Schalow's Green Fruit Pigeon
(Vinago schalowi) is often seen, always in flocks of from six to twenty
individuals, but never singly.
To really appreciate this bird one must see it in its natural haunts,
in the tall dense trees, on kopjes, or in the wooded parts by the rivers.
If one keeps perfectly quiet underneath one of their favourite trees
they will come noiselessly and feed upon the fruit, evincing little
fear, and can be observed for a considerable length of time.
While feeding their movements are remarkably Parrot-like, in fact
the first time I saw one feeding at a distance I mistook it for a Parrot.
They climb about the branches with great ease, sometimes hanging
head downwards to reach a berry or fruit.
These birds harmonize wonderfully well with the surrounding
foliage, especially when the sunlight is shining through the leaves.
In colour this Fruit Pigeon is a beautiful pale green of remarkable
intensity, which fades upon death ; it is paler below than above,
and on the hind neck is a patch of French grey ; the flight feathers,
secondaries, and the greater wing-coverts black edged with yellow,

the flights faintly, the secondaries more so, and the coverts broadly
striped. The shoulders rich maroon-grey ; the legs, which are entirely
feathered, are brilliant yellow, the lesser under tail-coverts green edged
with white, and the larger ones chestnut edged with the same colour.
The iris is of a remarkable pale blue, the base of the beak coral-red,
the other half ivory-white, the feet coral-red.
Unfortunately this bird is held in great esteem by Europeans
for the pot, and is consequently shot at every turn, so that it is remarkable
that it is as common as it is when one considers that Fruit Pigeons
are such slow breeders. Both male and female are alike in plumage.
They live upon wild fruit and berries, principally the wild fig.

THE BREEDING OF THE MANY-COLOURED

</sectionHeader>

By the Marquess of Tavistock
Some early writers have described the Many-colour as an almost
hopelessly difficult bird to keep, dying from what they believed to be
cerebral haemorrhage owing to the lack of some natural food for which
we are unable to supply any satisfactory equivalent. Later writers,
on the other hand, have asserted that the Many-colour is as hardy
and prolific as the Redrump. As a matter of fact, there is an element
of truth and a great deal of error in both theories regarding this pretty
Parrakeet. The Many-colour can be a most disheartening bird, but
it does not die of cerebral haemorrhage, and there is no sort of difficulty
about its food. Although with patience, and a certain amount of luck
in securing robust individuals, it can be acclimatized to the point of
standing a winter in an unheated outdoor aviary. It is capable of
giving rather more than the average amount of trouble in the matter of
chills, is susceptible to tuberculosis, and more than susceptible to every
form of septicaemia from the ordinary virulently infectious kind which
causes yellow spots on the liver to the more subtle ultra-microscopic
variety which enters the blood stream, kills birds singly, and gives
rise to symptoms easily mistaken for cerebral haemorrhage. If the
Many-colour by reason of the good luck or good management of its

owner manages to escape the various diseases to which it is so
exceedingly prone sufficiently long to arrive at the breeding season
after a clean moult, it is certainly no less willing to nest than its cousin
the Redrump but I wonder how many aviculturists who call the
Many-colour a hardy bird can boast of having kept the same pair
for shall we say eight or ten years, breeding from them successfully
each season ?
I have kept Many-colours on and off for more than ten years,
for the most part in the usual fixed type of aviary. In Bedfordshire
I had to give them up as hopeless as they never escaped tuberculosis
or spotted liver septicaemia for more than a year. In the Isle of Wight
they beat me by their proneness to the pseudo-cerebral haemorrhage
already referred to, and I had no better luck with them in Hampshire
for a time. As a last resort I tried them last year in my new type of
movable aviary with hanging shelters. The mortality at first was
as heavy as ever, but at last it was from preventable causes. They no
longer got infectious disease, but contracted chills from roosting in
exposed places, or committed suicide by hanging themselves against
the wire in night alarms. I therefore had an aviary made with an
inner lining of string netting to the roof and end of the flight, and a
closed shelter into which the birds were driven every night. Into
this aviary I turned the best surviving pair. In late autumn the hen
caught a cold, and I was obliged to put her for the winter in a roomy
cage in the heated birdroom, but the cock survived the bad weather
in the best of health and spirits. When May was well advanced I
put up two nest-boxes in the shelter and turned the hen in with her
mate, who was delighted to see her and very attentive. For a day
or two she put on airs when he fed her, standing as far away from him
as possible, and either biting him at the end of the operation or dashing
away as though she was afraid he would bite her. Very soon, however,
they were on the best of terms, and the cock kept trying to cajole
or coerce her into the nest-box. During all this time the birds were
shut up regularly each night, for my experience is that summer changes
of temperature are more deadly than those of winter. In due course
the eggs arrived, and late in July three young birds left the nest.
Two of them.-----a cock and a hen--were very fine, but the third little

hen was more backward and less strong on the wing when she first
came out of the shelter. It was pretty to see the concern of her parents
when she blundered about and seemed in danger of hurting herself.
As a precaution against accidents we put her back in the shelter,
where she remained several days, and when she again emerged she was
much better able to look after herself and she is now almost
indistinguishable from her sister. The other two young birds were
very quick to learn to go home to bed in the shelter through the small
hole used for the purpose, and after the first two or three nights were
as docile and easily managed as their parents. For a time the Many-
colours were a very happy family. I have seen the young cock combing
his sister's head feathers, while the latter performed the same kind
office for her mother ! The youngest hen was, and still is, the old
cock's favourite, and he used to be amusingly firm in seeing that she
got her fair share when he was feeding his offspring. If one of the
bigger ones pushed in before he considered that she had had enough
he absolutely ignored its demands and shifted his position until he
could reach the baby again. One afternoon I noticed that the old hen
seemed slightly out of sorts and was vomiting, but fortunately I took
her in time and after a couple of days in the hospital she was well
again, and I was able to pat her in a cage in the birdroom until I had
a suitable aviary vacant for her. It is a most important maxim in
successful bird-keeping never to return a bird that has been ill to the
same conditions as it was living under when it contracted the illness.
If you do, it is ten to one that it will soon be ill again, and probably
the second illness will be severe or fatal.
A few days ago the old cock began to get snappy with his son,
so I moved the latter to a separate aviary. His sex had been apparent
from the first, for although he had the red wing bar of the female
plumage, his cheeks were green, and he had a yellow frontal band.

mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish, the birds alone forming a wonderful
series of the rarest species. The writer spent a very enjoyable day
there recently, and feels that, as this collection is not so well known
as it might be, a few notes on it will be acceptable to members of the
Avicultural Society.
There are several ranges of aviaries, some entirely covered in with
glass roofs, some with extensive outside flights ; all are substantially
built and mostly heated by hot-water pipes.
The first aviary we visited contained an example of the curious
and unprepossessing New Guinea Crow (Gymnocorax senex), a fruit-
eating species of great rarity. The second aviary contained four
specimens of the very beautiful Pigmy Falcon (Poliohierax semitorquatus)
from Abyssinia, which appeared to be in excellent condition, though
it is certainly a difficult species. The next contained Senegal Rollers
and a very beautiful purple-coloured Jay, probably Cyanocorax
violaceus.
A large aviary, apparently partly formed out of a greenhouse,
was tenanted by Touracous, Crowned Pigeons, and Glossy Starlings,
not to mention a record pair of Leopard Tortoises.
A series of smaller aviaries contained Parrots, a wonderful series
of Amazons--Lesson's (lilacina), Salvins, the Diadem, Spectacled,
and others ; a magnificent Hawk-headed Parrot; pairs of Greater and

and Blue-headed Pionus, Ruepell's and Brown-necked Pceocephalus.
One aviary with a large grass enclosure contained quite a flock of
Gouldians which had bred freely, usually during the winter months,
and Mr. Whitley has discovered that the young are fed to a very large
extent upon short tender blades of grass. If the grass is allowed to
grew coarse failure is the result, but if kept cut so that the young shoots
can be eaten success in rearing is assured, and the cold of winter does
not seem to affect them. A large outside aviary contained White-faced
Herons, and a beautiful grey-coloured Egret, while near by was a very
fine South African Ground Hornbill. In another compartment was
the finest pair of Abyssinian Ground Hornbills that one could wish
to see anywhere, while a pair of White-necked Storks were nearly
as perfect. In a large open paddock was a pair of Crested Screamers

(Chauna) with their newly-hatched chicks, jolly little fluffy yellow
mites. The parents spend their lives with full powers of flight, and
are often seen on the wing at a great height. They nested some distance
away, and the hen and chicks were carried to the paddock nearer
home, a few feathers of the hen's wing being cut. She settled down
in the new place and was soon joined by her mate, and when I saw
them they all looked most happy. Later on I saw the cock bird flying
across the valley, and a fine sight he presented.
Kagus have nested on two occasions during the winter months,,
and although success has not quite been achieved there seems every
prospect that young may be reared ere long. The nest was made under
an inverted box, with one side broken away, in the wire enclosure of
the aviary. One egg only is laid to a clutch, and on the first occasion,
the chick died in the shell. A second attempt was soon made, but on
this occasion the chick died at hatching. So far as I know it is only-
in Australia that the Kagu has been bred in captivity, and there the
seasons are the same as in its own country--New Caledonia. One
became almost bewildered with all the rarities, and my notes were scanty
and do not profess to include anything like all the good things that
delight the heart of an aviculturist when he visits Primley. There-
was a pair of the rare Great-billed Raven ( Corvultur crassirostris)
from Abyssinia, the Leaden Crow Shrike from Australia, Beechey
Jays from Mexico, Mot-mots and Lanceolated Jays, Scarlet Ibises,,
and a very beautiful Slaty Egret (Lepterodius gularis). One largo
thickly-planted aviary contained Roulroul Partridges, Cuban Thrushes,
and Diuca Finches, and one would imagine all would breed, but for
some reason or other it is an unlucky aviary and birds decline to
breed there ; they appear to do better in small aviaries, each containing
one pair of birds. In such an aviary the beautiful Long-tailed Roller
(Coracias caudatus ) has nested and hatched, though the young died
at ten days old. Just at the time of hatching the hen violently attacked
the cock, though the reason for this behaviour is not clear. In another
aviary a Burchell's Glossy Starling mated with a Red-winged Starling,
and fertile eggs resulted. Red-collared Lorikeets have bred successfully,
and I saw a beautiful mud nest of the Grey Struthidea formed on the
top of a narrow beam. The birds were most attentive to one another

and to the nest, but no eggs had been laid at the time of my visit.
A pair of Barn Owls were diligently rearing young in one of the aviaries.
Two small Cockatoos were particularly interesting, for their species
has not been determined. They are the size of the Lesser Sulphur-crest,
but obviously quite distinct from this. They lack the yellow on the
cheeks and have smaller bills. They are in fact small images of the
Greater Sulphur-crested Cockatoo.
Red-collared Lorikeets have bred successfully, and so have Glossy
Starlings, but the species of the latter is a little uncertain.
I was greatly interested in a pair of young Red Mountain Doves
(Geotrygon montana) which Mr. Whitley show&apos;ed me in the nest, and here
I think Mr. Whitley has made an important discovery. These nestlings
possessed, besides the egg-tooth on the upper mandible, a similar
but sharper tooth or hook on the lower mandible. I made a rough
sketch of the head of one of the squabs at the time, and reproduce
it herewith. Whether this hook is used to enable the nestling to get
a hold with its bill to the inside of the parent's bill during the feeding
process, or whether it is for purposes of climbing is uncertain, but if
the bill is held in one's hand the sharp little hook is very distinctly
felt to catch on to one's skin.
I must not omit to mention a fine pair of the African Black Pie or
Piapec, and three splendid Cassowaries, one belonging to a species that
we could not determine ; nor must I forget the fine series of raptorial
birds, including the Angolian Vulture, Vociferous Sea Eagle, Jackal
and Common Buzzards, Black and Turkey Vultures, and Virginian
Eagle Owls.
A flock of some ten Emus, old and young, occupy a large paddock,
while Cranes of several species wander in semi-freedom, and on the
large pond may be seen a great variety of Waterfowl.

About three years ago, a London dealer wrote me that he had a
pair of South American Finches that he had shown to two or three
well-known ornithologists, who were all unable to put a name to
them, and asked me if I would care to have them. This sounded
interesting, and as the price asked was reasonable I decided to have
them and see if I could win another medal. On their arrival I was
rather disappointed, as they were extremely plain-looking little birds,
about the size of our Chaffinch. The general colour was greyish-brown,
the forehead, throat, and a patch on the rump brick-red. After a while
I found that one of them had a very good voice, not unlike that of
some Canaries that I have kept. They, were, however, always quarrelling
and I began to suspect that I had got two males. This was rather
confirmed in the following seasons, as no attempt was made at nest-
building, and one bird was always chasing the other. Last summer
our member, Dr. Hopkinson, honoured me with a visit, and he at
once pronounced them to be Mexican Rose-finches (Carpodacus
mexicanus), and that my birds were both males, so my hopes of breeding
them were at once knocked on the head.
On visiting Chapman's one day this spring I was surprised to see
a whole cage full of these birds that had just been landed from Mexico.
Amongst them was one bird without the red forehead and throat, and
this one I promptly secured. On introducing it to one of my males
his delight was immense, and I thought that he would burst his throat
in his singing efforts. Very shortly afterwards they went to nest,
building at the very top of a conifer, close under the wire of the aviary.
The nest was cup-shaped, made of roots and moss, and lined with a

few feathers. The four eggs were pale bluish-green, with a few widely
scattered buff spots. The nest was very much exposed, and, as I
feared, the first heavy rainfall drowned them out. However, this
didn't daunt them, and very soon they had made another nest in
a much more sheltered position. This time two young ones were
hatched after an incubation period of thirteen days. Both birds fed
the young, apparently principally upon seed. The only artificial food
provided was soaked bread. Twelve days later they both left the nest,
but for nearly a week kept themselves hidden in the bushes. As far
as I can see without handling, they are exactly like the mother. The
red throat and forehead will, I presume, not appear until after their
first moult.

genus. They are little birds about the size of Larks, with moderate-
sized beaks, the head covered with a long slender crest; short wings,
very long tail; their four toes are all directed forward, only the first
one is able to be brought back. They live in trees in flocks ; they
have a curious habit of suspending themselves from the branches,
with their bodies hanging below and on one side. They build cup-
shaped nests in bushes.
Colies are entirely fruit eaters and do very well in confinement
on the ordinary diet of such birds. But they are timid, stupid, and
dirty, and are not interesting in spite of their shape and curious habits.
They are fairly often imported, and the following have been on sale
in Europe and some even have nested.
Colius striatus from the Cape, brown varied with grey and striped
with dark tawny, and C. nigricollis from the Congo are almost alike,
.but the latter has a black throat and forehead.
C. leucotis from Abyssinnia differs in having whitish cheeks.
C. castanonotus from Western Africa, chestnut chocolate above,
yellow beneath, with the front of the head black powdered white,
and rosy grey cheeks.

Everybody knows our European Cuckoo, its unique song and parasitic
habits ; it is one of a very numerous family which embraces birds
varying from the size of a Lark to that of a Crow, and which is spread
all over the world. Nearly all Cuckoos are insectivorous, and have more
or less powerful, slightly curved beaks. They may be divided into
two groups : Cuckoos proper (Cuculince) and Coucals (Centropodince).
The first mentioned are arboreal, have slender beaks, long wings,
the tail rather poorly developed, and short legs. They are parasitic,
laying their eggs in other birds' nests. The second group have strong
beaks, long legs, short wings, and long tails ; they are ground birds,
and bring up their own young.
Many Cuckoos are pretty but modest in colouring, only the Emerald
Cuckoos (Chrysococcyx) have beautiful metallic colouring, but they
have not yet been kept in confinement. They are not much to be
recommended to aviary keepers, and are accordingly not often imported.
We may add that they are hard to keep alive, for they will only eat
living insects and balls of meat rolled in powdered insects or grated
breadcrumbs.
The Coucals make the best aviary birds, and although their
colouring is nob showy, they are elegant and live well on an insectivorous
mixture and a little meat.
The genus Cuculus comprises birds which have the following
characteristics : a large beak, rather depressed at its base and not
as long as the head ; wings long and subobtuse ; tail graduated, rounded,
short tarsus almost entirely feathered. A little bare space round
the eyes.

The Common Grey Cuckoo (Guculus canorus) is as big as a male
Sparrow Hawk; it has a similar flight, and when seen from below,
with his ashen grey breast marked with transverse black stripes, it
is sometimes taken for that bird. Indeed, in some countries the
peasants think and declare that the Cuckoo in its second year turns
into a Sparrow Hawk ! To define its plumage, the upper part of the
body, neck and breast are ashy blue ; the belly, thighs, abdomen and
lower tail-coverts whitish with transverse blackish-brown stripes ; the
webs of. the tail feathers blackish with a few small white spots.. The
edges of the beak and rims of the eyes are orange yellow. The immature
plumage or a more or less faulty moult have for a long time given rise
to belief in a distinct .species.
The. Cuckoo reaches Europe about the first week in April, and
spreads immediately through woods and coppices by the sides of
fields. It feeds almost exclusively on insects, grasshoppers, crickets,,
cockchafers, and above all on hairy caterpillars, which nearly all other
birds refuse ; to these delicacies it adds a little fruit. Being of a solitary
and distrustful nature,, it is generally. observed perching, for it is
awkward on the ground, only advancing by hops. It prefers to fly
*even short distances. The call of the male bird is the. well-known
" Cuckoo " which so delights the ear in the spring. In mild, clear
weather he calls most often in the evening, repeating without a pause.
He perches meanwhile on a bough and each time, raising his long tail,
he sings through the fine summer nights with great ardour, for he
seems to rest in the daytime, and at times leads a practically
nocturnal life.
The nesting habits of the Cuckoo were mysterious to us, and on
this subject alone if all the writings ancient and modem were collected
they would make a large book, and we may agree with Toussenel, who
so truly wrote " The history of the Cuckoo is one of the most interesting
in the whole animal kingdom 55 . Facts mount up, true, manifold,
and dissimilar from laying the egg till the young are fully reared.
One cannot but think that often the bird must act from an individual
impulse according to the circumstances which present themselves,
and does not, simply obey a general rule common to all the species.
We will simply say here that the Cuckoo distributes her eggs singly

among the nests of Passeres who incubate them and undertake the
rearing of the young Cuckoos. Before its departure towards the end
of September the Cuckoo becomes quite fat, which is contrary to the
proverb, " Thin as a Cuckoo."
It is found throughout Europe in summer except the extreme
north, Africa, and the West of Asia.
An example of the African Cuculus solitarius has lived for some
months in the London Zoological Gardens.
The Crested Cuckoo (Coccystes glandarius) or Cuckoo Jay. Both
male and female of this rare species have the crown and sides of the
head ashy grey streaked with black, the upper surface greyish brown
with a slight greenish lustre. Underneath yellowish-white, the sides
shading into grey ; wings greyish-brown tipped with white. Beak
brownish-black. This bird has not altogether the same habits as the
Cuckoo, and is more sociable ; its infrequent appearances in France
are always made in small troops. Its flight is rapid and light, it is not
difficult to approach, and moves from branch to branch, raising its
crest; it does not often settle on to the ground. Its voice is not like
the Cuckoo's, it is a sort of titter like that of the Magpie. It also lays
eggs in other birds' nests, especially those of Crows and Magpies.
This bird is a native of South and South-West Europe, Africa, and the
West of Asia. It is an accidental visitor to Central Europe as far as
England. It sometimes appears in the South of France, where it has
been taken in several places. It was proved to have bred there in
1884, when a young bird was caught which had fallen from
the nest.
The Coccyzus is exclusively American. Two species have been
accidental visitors to Europe. These birds build nests and incubate
their eggs. Their characteristics are a strong beak higher than wide
at its base, and as long as the head. Wings subobtuse, the tips reaching
to the middle of the tail, which is long and graduated.
American Cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus) is olive-grey with greenish
metallic reflections on the upper parts ; underneath it is yellowish-white
with the sides shading into grey. This species is confined to Central
and Southern America between which it migrates annually. Commonly
known as Bain Cuckoo, it collects into large companies which betake

themselves southward. A very rare accidental visitor to the West of
Europe, it has been taken in England, France, Belgium, and Italy.
The Red-eyed Cuckoo (Coccyzus erythrophthalmus) . In this bird
both sexes have the upper part of the body metallic olive-green with
the front of the head slate-grey. Below white with yellowish breast,
and the sides of the neck grey. Bare space round the eyes Vermillion.
This American species was once captured in England, 1871, and
another time in Italy.
The Cuckoo is not interesting in captivity; it would only be reared
as a curiosity, for it has no desirable qualities as an aviary bird. It
is not wild, but it seems sulky, melancholy, its movements are ungraceful,
and it is exceedingly voracious. It must be kept in a large aviary,
because in a moderately-sized cage it very soon soils its plumage,
which appears to be rather delicate. Its food should consist of insectile
mixture, meat, and a few large insects. The last Cuckoo we kept in
confinement was found in a public garden in Paris ; it was a young
bird which had escaped from a cage, for it was very tame and quite well
understood how to ask for food.
The Jay Cuckoo is said by those who have kept it in their aviaries
to be much more interesting ; it requires the same food, but is much
more lively and active, which preserves that elegant shape which the
Cuckoo sometimes loses.
We will only quote briefly such exotic Cuckoos as have been
imported:--
Hierococcyx varius from India resembles a Sparrow Hawk.
The Koel (Eudynamis honorata), very common in India and
Indo-China ; the male is black, the female striped black and white.
I have kept several examples in an aviary in Annam ; they are partly
frugivorous.
Urodynamis traitensis is allied to it; it comes from the Pacific
Islands ; it is marked with dark brown, red and white.
Coucals properly so called ( Centropus) live on the ground or in
bushes, and are usually very common. Many species are chestnut,
with head, neck and under parts more or less pure black; others have
these parts streaked white on a brown ground. C. sinensis from Asia
belongs to the first category; and C. senegalensis, monachus , super-

ciliosus from Africa to the second ; as for the large C. pko^sianus from
Australia, or Crow Pheasant, its head and breast are black, back wings
and tail tawny rayed with brown. All, or almost all, have ruby red
eyes. The legs are long and strong, and the hind toes are prolonged
by a very long and straight claw.
Saurothera vetulci, from Jamaica, is somewhat like the above,
but has not the long claw ; it is brown, paler underneath.
The Carpococcyx are handsome, large Ground Cuckoos found in
Sumatra, Borneo, and Indo-China. C. radiatus from Borneo, which
has been kept in London, is dark green above, grey streaked with
black below ; head violet-black ; C. renauldi is a very rare bird from
Annam and Siam, grey above, pale yellow below, with head, neck,
breast and tail bronzy-black. In Annam I kept the only seven specimens
yet met with alive for a fortnight.
Geococcyx mexicanus is another large Ground Cuckoo which has
olive-green and white plumage, the belly being of the latter colour ;
it is a native of North America.
The Guira (Guira guira) is another American Cuckoo from the
Argentine, with tawny and chestnut plumage. It has been bred in
England.
Lastly we will mention the Ani ( Crotophaga ), a black bird with
metallic spots and large swollen beak. They live among the cattle,
which they relieve- of their ticks, and nest gregariously, several females
uniting for incubation. They are found in all parts of tropical America.

There are perhaps birds of more magnificent plumage than the
Touracous, but to my mind none more entirely desirable ; most
of them possess all the qualities which one requires in an aviary bird.
Their shape is perfect, their plumage enchanting ; their character
tame and gentle ; they live long without special care, and, with me
at any rate, breed freely. I own that Touracous are the birds which
I like best of all.

called " Louries ?5 , and in West Africa " Clock Birds They are
fairly large, ranging from the size of a Magpie to that of a Pheasant;
their feet are short but their toes fairly long, two are turned to the
back and the fourth, the outside one, can be turned either one way or
the other indifferently. More often they have small short beaks,
but some are thick and arched; the head is adorned with a thick
crest, the wings are rounded, the tail long and wide, the plumage is
very delicate.
The male and female are alike, but the former is usually
distinguishable by his superior size and stronger beak.
Touracous are arboreal and live in forests ; they move along the
branches with an ease which reminds one of Squirrels. They are
vegetarians, living chiefly on fruit and leaves, occasionally a few worms
or insects, but many of them do not care about these. Their resounding
call sounds like a loud coo, short and often repeated ; they also utter
a low grunt.
These birds build large nests of twigs like those of certain Pigeons,
and it has been said that they lay as many as five eggs. My experience
with Touracous in confinement is that they invariably lay two eggs.
Fraser&apos;s Touraeou, which nested with Mr. Johnstone, and the Bose-
crested Touracou from both of which Mr. Astley obtained eggs, all laid
two eggs in large baskets.
With me at Yillers-Bretonneux, where I reared during several
years and to the third generation Senegal Touracous, they always
nested in large boxes provided with an open front. Besides the
cases mentioned above, no other Touracous have been bred in an
aviary. The young are covered with black down, and are remarkable
for having claws on their wings, which disappear after a time.
Touracous must be given large aviaries, for they are active, and
their beauty---when in flight they display all the splendour of their
scarlet wings--makes it worth while to indulge them. From October
to April they should be given moderate heat, but they are not delicate.
For food I have found them do satisfactorily on fruit, especially apples,
bananas, cooked rice and potato, raisins, and dried figs. They also
eat leaves. All my young birds &amp;quot;were reared on this diet.
Unfortunately, Touracous are rarely imported and command

high prices ; I have only lately been able, after ceaseless endeavour,
to obtain a pair to replace my three breeding pairs which I lost in the
destruction of my birds in 1918 at Villers-Bretonneux.
The most numerous and prettiest of the family are the Green
Touracous ( Turacus ) ; they are also the smallest, more or less the
size of a Magpie. All the species resemble each other : their general
colour is green, with wings and tail violet or green shot purple, and
carmine flights ; this beautiful colour is made of a special pigment
which is said to be soluble in water ; the head and crest are marked
with either white or pink ; the crest is high and covers all the head ;
the whole base of the beak is hidden by feathers. Several kinds have
been imported.
The Senegal Touracou (T. persa) is a native of West Africa.
It is green with purple violet wings and tail; the crest is green,
slightly pink at the tip ; the lores black ; a white line passes below
the eye, another in front and before it, the skin round the eye
is red.
I reproduce here what I previously published concerning these
delightful birds :--
" In the spring of 1914 our colleague, M. Robert Pauvels, consented
to sell me the pair of these birds wdiich he had kept after the sale
of his superb collection at Everberghe (Belgium). They were brought
to me in the month of May at Villers-Bretonneux. They had lived several
years in Belgium, but never laid. I placed them in an outdoor aviary,
12 metres long by 4 wide, planted with shrubs and enclosed by
walls on the north, east, and west. In the centre of the north wall
was a glass shelter of 2 X 1 metre. Under this shelter I arranged a
covered box with an entrance hole of about 50 square centimetres.
" The Touracous at once made themselves at home in their new
abode and frequented the box, where they passed the night.
" The beginning of June, on visiting them, I found two large white
round eggs about as big as a Golden Pheasant's laid on some wisps
of hay roughly put together. I was charmed with this discovery,
all the more so because the male and female incubated steadily, and
at the end of eighteen days I saw two nestlings hatch out covered with
black down. My joy did not last long. At the end of eighteen days

I found the corpse of one nestling thrown out underneath the nest,
and on the morrow the second.
" Two days later the female had laid again in the same nest, which
had been kept very clean, and the second incubation began ; two young
hatched out the end of July, and they also were killed and thrown out
. by their parents. I despaired then of rearing these birds, which seemed
to have the same fault of so many exotic birds, which is the most serious
impediment to their reproduction in aviaries : the exaggerated ardour
of the male, who kills the young after one or two weeks so as to start
a fresh nest.
" I was mobilized from 1st August, and thought no more of the
Touracous until my mother, who busied herself actively with my birds
in my absence, wrote to me that a young Touracou had been born
the 1 st September, during the German occupation, and that its parents
this time were rearing it w T ell!
" The season was advanced, the breeding fever of the male had
cooled down, and he no longer troubled about reproduction. The young
one lived two and a half months, but it was rickety, its feet were
defective, and it died the beginning of November, when the pair of
Touracous were taken indoors to a heated aviary, where they passed
the winter.
" My mother had them put. back in their open-air aviary at the
end of April, 1915. They lost no time in building their nest in the box ;
two young hatched out during June, and were quickly killed off by
their parents. On 23rd July they laid again, and two more young
appeared the 10th to 12th August. This time my mother intended to
take the young birds when they reached the age of twenty days and
bring them up by hand.
" She watched them most carefully to prevent their murder. But
this time the birds reared their young perfectly, and on 5th September
one left the nest and was found perching on the branch of a shrub.
It was still small and covered with black down, nevertheless the black
wing feathers were sufficiently developed for it to fly. At night, however,
the youngster was replaced in its nest, whence it came out every morning.
. The other nestling, which was weaker, did not emerge. It had
malformed feet, and died when two months old.

" The first one progressed rapidly and seemed always in perfect
health ; on 20th September its crest began to show, black feathers
gradually replaced the down, and some red feathers appeared in the
wings. By 10th October it was two-thirds as big as its parents, its
crest was larger and turned green, but there was neither red nor
white about its eyes. The red circle round the eyes appeared on
15th October. It was turned into the heated aviary with its parents
on 20th October, and on the 24th the white lines showed near the eyelids.
By 24th December it resembled its parents save that it was a very
little smaller, its crest not quite as thick and colours not quite as
brilliant. By the end of January, 1916, even these differences had
disappeared.
" The young Touracou began to feed itself at the end of September,
but its parents still tended it devotedly.
" It was separated from them in May, 1916, when the old pair
were again turned out of doors.
"In 1916 the Touracous had a brood in June, and killed their
young as before ; then a second brood was hatched on 20th July.
One young one died at the end of fifteen days. The second was healthy
and grew up as the one of the previous year.
" In 1918 two more young were reared, one by the old pair, the other
by the young hen reared in 1915 and an imported cock. All these
Touracous had the same food : potato, bananas cut into small cubes,
and raisins, no insects nor any kind of animal food, and no other
kind of fruit. On this diet only the old birds reared their young,
which I believe they nourish after the fashion of Pigeons."
Buffon's Touracou (T. buffoni) from the same regions as the above
is distinguished only by the absence of the white line under the eye ;
it is doubtful if it be really a distinct species.
Schalow's Touracou ( T . schalowi) from South-East Africa is-
distinguished from the Senegal Touracou by its long crest, tipped with
white, and its dark green wings shot with blue.
Livingstone's Touracou (T. livingstoni ) differs only in having
a greener tail. It is West African. T. hybridus from Nyassaland is
also very closely related.
The Lourie Touracou (T. corythaix) from South Africa is like the

above ; it has the two marks on the face and the edge of the crest
white; wings and tail bronzy green. This species nested with Mr. Astley,
but the young did not live.
Fraser's Touracou ( T . macrorhynchus) from West Africa wears
a green crest with a white band and a terminal black band ; it has only
one white mark on the face under the eye. The whole back, wings
and tail are purple-violet. It has been bred in England.
The Pink - crested Touracou (T. erytliroiophus ) comes from the
same locality; it is slightly smaller, its face and chin are white, crest
and nape bright pink; the former tipped with white; the wings,
back, and tail are bronzy-green. It nested with Mr. Astley, but the
young could not be reared. We reproduce a photograph of this bird
taken by Mr. Seth-Smith in the London Zoological Gardens.
Donaldson's Touracou (T. donaldsoni) , a very beautiful species from
North-East Africa, has been recently imported in considerable numbers.
The genus Gallirex contains two species, distinguished from
those of the genus Turacus by the beak being freer; like them their
flight feathers are beautiful carmine-red. Two species of the genus
have been imported : the Purple-crested Touracou ( G. porphyreolophus)
from Southern Africa, which is entirely dark green shot with violet,
except the neck and front of the breast, which are light green shot
with rose colour ; and G. chlorochlamys from East Africa, which is
only distinguished by having a pure green neck.
The Grey Touracous ( Chizorhis ) are much plaiuer than the species
described hitherto. G. concolor from South Africa is uniform ashy-grey ;
it was freely imported some years ago, and I owned several, but found
them dull and uninteresting. C. afncana, a large grey bird marked
with black above, white striped black underneath, and having a brown
head, was also imported. It comes from East Africa.
The Plantain - eaters (Musophaga) are large Touracous with
strong yellow bills prolonged by a little helmet. Their plumage is
metallic violet with the top of the head carmine-red as well as the
flights; both species of the genus have been imported ; M. violacea
from Senegambia, which has a very short crest and a white line under
the eye ; and M . rossce from Angola and the Congo, with a more
developed crest, and without the white line on the face.

Lastly I will mention the Giant Touracou (Corytkceola cristata)
from Angola and the Congo. I owned the only specimen which ever
came over to us. This splendid bird is the size of a large Pheasant;
the neck, back, and wings are pale blue, the breast yellowish-green,
the belly chestnut, the median tail feathers are blue, the others pale
yellow, all finished off by a wide black band ; the head is whitish-grey,
and carries a large black crest, the long curved beak is yellow, the
tip red.
In my opinion the peculiar Hoatzin (Opisthocomus hoazin), which
is to be met with in the hot parts of South America, is related to the
Touracous, to whom it bears a faint resemblance, although it is heavy,
awkward, and slow. Young birds have well-developed claws on their
wings and use them in climbing ; they swim and dive equally well.
These birds always live by the side of rivers on trees overhanging
the water, and spend their lives there feeding on leaves and building
Pigeon-like nests. They are as big as a Pheasant, brown streaked with
white, with a large slender crest.
I had the opportunity of seeing Hoatzins at close quarters on the
Apure in Venezuela, and in Guiana, and they are really most curious
birds, not timid. Mr. Beebe, who has made a close study of them,
considers them ugly and grotesque. I, on the contrary, think they
are curious, even handsome. No living Hoatzin has yet reached
Europe, but their importation is not impossible, for individuals have
lived in confinement in British Guiana, fed at first on different kinds
of leaves and then on lettuce and cabbage, which they eat readily
and which suits them very well.

Sir, --I have been rather struck by the care and intelligence displayed
by one of my cock Barrabands in training his offspring to understand
the construction of the aviary. All my cock Barrabands, old and

against Owls are trained to re-enter an aviary each evening through
a small door low down in the front end. This door, by reason of its

size and position, is not at all readily found by an untrained bird,
especially from the inside, but the trained ones know all about it and
fly straight down on to the bracket holding the food dish and out
through the opening directly the door is opened in the morning.
Some even fly straight through the small hole without settling at
all, but untrained birds fly backwards and forwards among the upper
perches. The bird about which I am writing has one son a few months
old, who, having found his way into the night aviary, experiences
considerable difficulty in discovering the exit. For several days, when
I opened the little door in the morning, his father, in place of flying
on to the bracket and then out, would climb down the wire from one
of the top perches and climb into the open doorway. He would then
turn round and address some remarks to his child, obviously calling his
attention to the lesson, after which he would climb back again and
repeat the whole process once more. Then, as his son remained stupidly
indifferent, he would lose patience and fly off for the day, evidently
thinking he had done his best for the silly child ! I thought that
the old cock showed something more than mere instinct, for not only
was he trying to teach his offspring about something quite outside
the natural experience of his race, but he even seemed to be aware
that the young bird, though as fast and strong on the wing as himself,
when free would more easily find his way to the awkward and obscure
opening by climbing down to it than by flying down to it, as he did
himself. It is, in fact, always by climbing to it that young Barrabands
first learn the secret of the little door.

THE DISPLAY OF THE ZEBRA DOYE
Sir, --I have seen no record of the very pretty display of the male
of this little Dove. The other day I was looking at my birds, when
suddenly the male started bowing to the female and spreading his
tail up like a Fan-tailed Pigeon, but much prettier; when the tail was
up it formed a long oval fan of grey with white dots or eyes all along
the edge, finishing off with the black tips of the tail feathers. It was
a pretty sight, and I hope it will prove attractive to the hen ; so far

UPS AND DOWNS OF THE BREEDING SEASON
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996711741935484" page_id="56188800"  page_num="292" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Now that the breeding season is over, I should like to relate
some of my successes and failures, the latter being such as the
aviculturist meets with during a season, especially when he is trying
to breed with fresh imported birds so as to be first on the field to succeed
in breeding some bird or other that has not been bred in an English
aviary before.
Starting with my successes--I have bred this year the Green,
Olive, Yellow and Blue Budgerigar in plenty; Peach-faced Lovebird,
five young; Black-cheeked Lovebirds, nine young; Cockatiels, five
young; Redrump, three young; Orange-flanked Parrakeets, five
young, two killed when about ten days old; Abyssinian Lovebirds,
four young, only two reared; and I think if the summer weather had
only lasted a little longer I should have been able to add the Tuipara
Parrakeet to my list, but alas, they did not come into my hands until
late in the season, and by the time a nest box had been chosen and they
were thinking of nesting seriously, the cold weather started, and I
would not chance such little rarities and gems to the cold and risks
of egg-binding, but am hoping for better results with them next year.
Now for failures. The birds that I have been unable to do anything
with are: Blue-headed Pionus, a cock Black-headed Caique mated
to a hen Yellow-headed Caique, Blossom-headed Parrakeet, Senegal
and Meyers Parrots, Blue-winged and Madagascar Lovebirds.
These have all teased me throughout the year. Each pair took
to a nest, fed each other, were in and out the box all day, sleeping
in it at night, and Heaven help an intruder, and after all this my
hopes went west, as only one bird of this lot even condescended to
lay. That was the Blossom-head, but she would not sit, and a
Cockatiel would not oblige by taking the eggs.
Hoping to hear through our Magazine of breeders and their
successes, which I think are always of general interest.
W. Lewis.

line ? In the issue of 9th September a whole column bears the heading
" Avicultural Notes ", and deals with birds, mostly foreign, and their
needs, real or supposed. A year or two ago a Red Cardinal had almost

HYBRID ADELAIDE AND PENNANT PARRAKEETS
Sir, --It may interest some of the members of the Avicultural
Society to hear of the breeding of some hybrids that has lately taken
place this summer in my aviaries. I had a pair of Adelaides and an odd
Pennant hen ; the cock Adelaide paired with the Pennant, and would
have nothing to do with the Adelaide hen, so when I saw this I took
away the Adelaide hen, and immediately the Pennant went into the
nesting box, laid three eggs, and hatched three nice young birds, which
are all now flying about and very healthy. They are very like young
Pennants, and I expect it will be interesting when they moult to see
which type they most favour. The curious thing about them is that
they are so much smaller than the parent birds.

eight coloured plates. With regard to the former, some may consider the

author slightly behind the times in his nomenclature ; for instance, he
retains the name of Cypselus apus for the Swift, and that of Dendrocopus
major for the Greater Spotted Woodpecker, names that we have all
known from our youth, instead of employing the new ones of Apus
apus and Dryohates major anglicus. When one is reviewing the
birds of a continent or of the world it is necessary to employ trinomial
nomenclature in order to differentiate the various geographical races,
but in a popular book confined to purely British birds the old familiar
names are best, and we think Mr. Thorburn's method will commend
itself to the ordinary bird-lover. A short, concise, and up-to-date
account of each species, occupying a page or so, gives all the information
that one requires. How up-to-date the letterpress is may be judged from
the account of the Cuckoo in which Mr. Edgar Chance's quite recent
observations of its laying habits are cited. But the great value of the
book lies in its illustrations. Howard Saunders and others have given
us admirable books on British Birds, but their wood-cut illustrations
were not sufficient to allow of accurate identification, and the only
works with coloured plates were excessively expensive. Mr. Thorburn
has illustrated almost every species with coloured plates that can only
be described as superb, exquisite drawings having been most admirably
reproduced. Certainly never before has such a beautiful book on birds
been produced at such a very moderate price. The work will be com-
pleted in four volumes, each containing forty-eight coloured plates.

The German avicultural journal, Die Gejiederte Welt, is a really
wonderful production in all ways. It goes on year after year (it is now
in its 54th) always the same, that is, full of interesting and instructive
articles (often illustrated) and notes on birds and bird matters, and
yet ever varying. It flourishes, too (perhaps the greatest wonder),
with scarcely a mention of the Canary, and with advertisements
occupying only about 25 per cent of its pages, instead of the 50 or
more which, together wdth about the same amount of Canary matter,
seems essential to the existence of a similar paper with us.
Another remarkable point about the Die Gejiederte Welt is the fact

that during its 54 years' life it has only had two editors. It was founded
by Dr. Karl Russ and edited by him for many, many years, to be
succeeded by his friend, Karl Neunzig, who now holds the reins and
carries on the excellent tradition of the founder.
Among the many excellent articles which have appeared during
the last two months, one of the most interesting perhaps is the Editor's
review of new arrivals and rarely imported species, which is still " to
be continued ". Among the birds described are several Woodpeckers,
Celeus jlavescens (a number imported in 1924 and once at least previously
--1877), Chloronerpes flavinucha (Mr. Astley's bird, Avic. Mag., 1924),
and Brachyptemus aurantius (Berlin Zoo, 1905). Dull accounts of
all these are given with illustrations of some, and the article deals
with a number of other birds, of which there is only space to mention
the " new " Donaldson's Turaco, a variety of Toucans, and among
smaller birds, Emins Weaver ( Othyphantes emini). Have any of the
last reached England yet ? Among " new to aviculture " birds, it
will be noticed that Herr Neunzig includes Uraeginthus bengalus
schoenus Neum., Lagonosticta senegala carlo Zedh, Aidemosyne canlans
orientalis Lor. and Hellm., all East African races of common West
African " Waxbills ". Alas ! Are sub-species to invade Aviculture
and constitute new records ?
Besides the longer articles, every week's issue contains a number
of " Notes ", Answers and Queries, and four to six illustrations mostly of
the rarer species. Once a quarter a coloured plate is issued, and all for

Election of Officers
There is no doubt that permission would be given to the Avicultural
Society to import certain Australian birds for the private collections
of its members, but the transport of such birds would be a difficulty.
They would have to be accompanied by some experienced person who
would give them every attention during the voyage, and it is difficult
to see how the Society could arrange for this, but we understand that
Mr. Chapman, of 17 Tottenham Court Road, London, W. 1, has obtained
permission to import a limited number of such birds, providing these
are destined solely for Zoological Gardens or for the private collections
of members of the Avicultural Society, and that he proposes, very
shortly to send out one or two experienced persons to collect and bring
home a collection. But before doing so he must receive definite orders,
accompanied by an undertaking that the required birds, or other
Australian animals, are solely for the collection of the member ordering
them, and are not to be used for trade purposes. We would strongly
advise our members to take advantage of this opportunity.

In the last two or three years our stock of foreign aviary birds
has been greatly increased by importations of Abyssinian species,
among which two of the most beautiful are the Royal and Superb
Starlings (Cosmopsarus regius and Spreo sujperbus). The latter has
become a most popular bird, and a great number have been imported,
being very hardy and easy to breed. Last year I related my success
in breeding them for the first time in Europe, and since then others
have been equally successful. I will now add a few words to complete
my account of their nesting last year. It may be remembered
that I was puzzled as to the sexes of my four birds, and only last
autumn I discovered that I had three cocks and only one hen.
The first bird, which was attacked by the other three which I had
turned out of the aviary, was the hen bird. She had layed the eggs
before she was removed from the aviary, and had nothing to do with
the incubating or the rearing of the young. All this was very success-
fully done by the three male birds. Later on, when I put the hen
back with one of the cock birds, she nested again, and hatched
three young, which were not fully reared owing to the lateness of
the season. This year the same pair reared three young early in
May. Later they had nests and young ones on three occasions,
none of which were fully reared on account of the extraordinary
behaviour of the three first young ones reared. These insisted
on continually feeding their younger brothers and sisters, and

consequently killed them by kindness, as they were also being fed
by their parents. The Royal Starlings, of which I have three
specimens, are probably the most beautiful of all Starlings, and the
finest birds one can dream of. The accompanying plate shows that
they are beautifully shaped birds and not lacking in colour. They
sing a good deal and have a soft voice. I do not find them as hardy
as the Superb and other Starlings, and they are not able to stand
cold and damp weather. Mine are kept indoors all the winter
and are turned out in the large aviary in the summer. Out of the
three I have, two are always together, and are most friendly, but
they showed no signs of nesting this summer. Both these Starlings
make excellent cage-birds.

This bird, which comes from Cuba, is about 10 inches long
and about the size of a Bleeding-heart Pigeon, but thicker-set.
The forehead is whitish-grey, changing into dark grey on the top of
the head. Neck, dark grey with green and violet reflections ; back,
glossy violet changing into dark blue on the rump ; whitish throat
and a grey breast; middle of the abdomen reddish-white ; under
tail-coverts cinnamon; wings, greyish brown with purple and
green reflections; primaries edged with cinnamon; bill, pinkish
white at the tip and carmine red at the base ; feet, pale pink ; eye,
vermilion red. Female : a little smaller and duller than the male.
It is a very rare bird in Cuba, where it lives mostly on the ground
in thickly wooded parts, and is threatened with extinction by the
increasing cultivation of the country, so it is very advisable to breed
and keep up the species in captivity. I got my pair from
Mme. Lecallier who, I believe, has had four young ones from
one pair of birds, and has had a good many more eggs. M. Decoux^

has had several clutches but reared only one young bird. My birds
had a nest and one egg in May, which came to nothing. Then they
successfully reared one young one in June. All these dutches have
been of one large egg of rather a. deep buff colour, so it can be safely
concluded that the bird lays only one egg. The newly-hatched
bird is covered with yellow down. When leaving the nest, the feathers
of the upper part are dark brown edged with reddish buff. The
under parts are chestnut brown. Forehead, brownish grey and throat
pale grey and a brown bill. When about two months old the bird
moults into the adult plumage. They do not seem to be so
insectivorous as the Bleeding-heart Pigeon, and although I have
seen them eating mealworms, the young are brought up on seed.

After trying for several years I have at last been successful in
obtaining some living specimens of the very rare Pink-headed Duck.
This bird has become so rare that a good many people thought
they were really extinct. By offering rewards to Indian bird-catchers
my brother was successful in getting me five live specimens--three
drakes and two ducks. They all arrived in perfect condition some
time in July, and were at once turned out in my largest aviary,
where there is a fair-sized pond. I am sorry to say that one drake
died of an accident, and another, a month after arrival, of some
affection of the eye. The three remaining ones, one drake and two
ducks, are flourishing, and up to the time of writing (end of October)
look wonderfully well. They are out all day long, but I shut them
in at night. I hope- they will survive. the winter and breed next
season. The unusual coloration of the:adult male is a rich blackish
brown with a white mirror on the wings. The head,, side, and back

foreparts of throat and neck are brownish black. Legs and feet,

Although, sad to relate, I have no breeding success to chronicle,
the melancholy interest that attaches itself to any bird on the verge
of extinction justifies a few notes on this interesting race of the Red-
fronted New Zealand Parrakeet, once well known to European
aviculturists. The brown rat, it appears, has overrun Norfolk
Island with the usual consequences to the native fauna, and the
Parrakeets, being ground-nesting birds, are said to be now extinct
on all but one or two outlying islets where a few pairs may, perhaps,
linger. Through the kindness of a friend I was able, in the summer
of 1924, to obtain two pairs of Norfolk Islands, and my hopes
of breeding them ran high, as the New Zealand Parrakeet has a
reputation (undeserved in my own experience) of being easy to manage
and very prolific. Ill-luck, however, attended the venture. A few
days after their arrival an epidemic broke out among some Ceylon
Hanging Parrots which had arrived on the same boat, and the infection
had evidently reached the Norfolk Islands, two of which also fell
victims. The survivors I turned into an outdoor aviary, shutting
them up each night. They did. well for some weeks and then the
hen (?) got a chill and had to be brought into hospital. On her
recovery I returned her to the aviary, but a short time after she
got another chill and again had to be brought indoors. As the
nights were getting cold, I decided, as a precautionary measure,
to bring the cock in too. He was in splendid condition but two
days later he fell ill and died, while his more delicate partner recovered!
I later turned her into an old aviary where the shelter was kept at

a high temperature. Here she lived the greater part of the winter,
but in April she suddenly succumbed to fatty degeneration of the
heart. Shortly before her decease I had received two more Norfolk
Islands, and at the same time I learned that I had been feeding
my birds wrongly. It appears that they should have hardly any
hemp or sunflower and should be fed almost entirely on canary seed
and oats, with a few peanuts and apple. On this diet the last arrivals
have done extremely well, but I fear that both are males, for although
they show a difference in the shape of the head they have crimson
eyes, while the eyes of the bird that died in April were much browner.
In June I turned the couple into one of my newest movable aviaries,
shutting them up at night and warming the shelter with brooder
lamps. They are now clean moulted and have come through the
latest weather eccentricities of, from an avicultural point of view,
the most abominable year I can remember, without ill effects. In
many ways the Norfolk Island is an interesting and attractive.bird,
very unlike most Parrakeets in some of its ways. It is about the
size of a Pennant, but with a shorter tail. The plumage is green
with a red cap. The beak is rather large and of a silvery colour
merging into black. The toes are very long, as one would expect of
a bird that spends much of its time on the ground. The Parrakeet's
movements are very brisk and sudden, both in flying, running, and
leaping from perch to perch. In the aviary they spend as much
time on the perches as any other Parrakeet, a circumstance which
rather surprised me, as I expected I might have to provide
accommodation for practically terrestrial birds. The cry is peculiar--
a soft " Heigh-ho ! " varied by a gentle murmuring and a louder
and somewhat goat-like bleat.
My Norfolk Islands seem to be intelligent birds. Though rather
wild on arrival they soon learned that people outside the aviary
will not hurt them and now permit a very close approach. One,
in particular, rather objects to being shut up at night. He goes
through the hole into the shelter docilely enough, but the moment
my back is turned, as I go to let down the slide that closes this hole
he is often out again like a flash and carefully conceals himself behind
a board where he is invisible to anyone standing at the end of the

aviary. He executes this strategem with so much dispatch that it
was by the merest accident that I discovered that he was still in the
aviary flight the first time he tried it. I had, as I thought, shut both
birds safely up for the night and sat down at some distance from the
aviaries to watch some Barrabands I was training to fly at liberty
and come home in the evening. After about a quarter of an hour
I was surprised to see my friend the Norfolk Island still disporting
himself in the open flight ! Next time I drove him in I kept my eye
on him and saw him whisk out again and hide himself the moment
my back was turned. He knew perfectly well what he was about as,
when let out in the morning, he never thinks of hiding. I have never
seen a Norfolk Island attempt to climb wire-netting with the aid of
the beak and they seldom use the foot to hold an object they are
eating, nor do they often sit on one leg when at rest. Like most
Parrakeets they are fond of nibbling the bark on their perches,
but they do not damage exposed woodwork, nor bite holes in wire-
netting.

Although there is enough evidence to show that the practice of
keeping birds in captivity in the East, and especially in India, was in
vogue from the very earliest times, the species or varieties of birds so
kept were usually those which could be easily reconciled to cage-life and
would readily thrive on a diet which came handy to their keepers.
Not infrequently the majority of these birds were graminivorous or
omnivorous by choice, being very hardy and having a wonderful
capacity for adapting themselves to changed circumstances as regards
both food and environment. These keepers of bird-pets, although
taking sufficient care of their charges, never aspired to solve the various
problems which confront the modern aviculturist regarding proper
food, suitable accommodation in the different seasons involving
different degrees of temperature, humidity, etc., appropriate nesting
sites, the limit to which birds of varied temperament and habits
could be allowed to mix together, etc.

Food Problem in Aviculture under Indian Conditions 303
The idea of furthering the cause of science with the aid of aviculture,
that is to say, by a study of the habits and life-history of birds belonging
to the different parts of the earth, originated with the Westerners ;
and although we sometimes find traces of sporadic attempts at bird-
culture in Asia they can never be taken as the outcome of a serious
study of bird-life from the scientific point of view. Nothing could
better testify to the whole-hearted devotion of European aviculturists
towards this end than the world-wide impetus they gave to the collec-
tion of rare species, the effect of which was felt in India. The desire of
these devotees to science for stocking their aviaries with birds gathered
and purchased at enormous cost from all parts of the world fostered
a brisk trade amongst foreign bird-dealers, who set about collecting
for exportation new species which were hitherto unknown as cage-birds.
Indian bird-dealers were not slow to avail themselves of this opportunity
and contrived with the aid of clever catchers to keep alive delicate
insectivorous birds by means of an artificial diet. Hitherto the staple
diet known to the Indians for insectivorous " soft-billed birds " was
satoo and ghee mixed together, with an admixture of maggots. But
this diet had little success with the smaller and more delicate insect-
eating birds. The bird-dealers hit on the ingenious device of mixing
meat and carrot with the satoo diet, and managed to keep these birds
alive sufficiently long to cover the period of exportation. This served
their purpose, no doubt, but for an aviculturist to achieve success
with the aid of this diet, not only in keeping alive his charges for any
length of time but also in encouraging them to breed and rear their
offspring, is a knotty problem. A man with any experience of Indian
conditions and the supply of insect food by professional Indians, is
apt to be diffident of the value of such a diet. He knows that even
minced meat will not much improve its quality, though it might
have some success with a few larger insectivorous birds. In Europe
the conditions affecting the supply of insect food is different--a rich
and a varied menu, both live and preserved, is catered for, and people
are never loath to supply artificial stimulation with the help of heat
and electricity. Even prepared milk and kindred sources of food
supply are available in plenty, so that the aid of science is brought
in towards the solution of a very difficult problem in regard to aviculture.

To quote one example of this resourcefulness of Western aviculturists,
the name of Mr. Alfred Ezra stands pre-eminent. It is through his
efforts that such nectar-eating tiny birds as the Nectariniidcz are
nowadays included in the category of cage-birds.
The ingenuity of the Indian bird-dealers is never on a par with that
of European birdmen. But sometimes we find that the example of
the latter is emulated by the Indian professionals who, in their zeal
for making money by exporting Indian birds of various sorts, tax their
brains to devise ways and means to reconcile wild-caught feathered
folk to captivity. In the district of Barielly, for instance, there is a
class of dealers who resort to the cruel device of stitching up the eyes of
newly caught birds and hand-feeding them for a time, after which
the latter settle down to their confinement, when their eyes are released.
The effect of this process is marvellous, and I have seen such difficult
and recalcitrant birds as the Terpsiphone paradisi and Pericrocotus
speciosus quietly submitting to their altered lot and thriving on an
artificial diet. Barielly, being a hilly region, it is the centre of a large
supply of insectivorous hill birds noted for their song, colour and
sprightly habits. Another means of keeping the wild newly caught
birds reconciled to captivity is the provision of a suitable cage where
these birds can be housed side by side with the tame and steadied
birds belonging to the same species, genus or family and having many
traits common to each other. The most inexpensive means which
the Indian dealers have devised for providing such a house is no other
than a rectangular cage of split bamboos with six or eight small
compartments in it. A tame bird (one which has been steadied and
reconciled to confinement for some time) is introduced into each of the
compartments on its immediate right or left, so that the free and
easy manners of the tame birds make the newly caught bird shake
off its fright due to new surroundings. The feeding cups of the new
captive are placed adjacent to those of its neighbours, so that, when
it sees other birds taking food of their own accord, it gradually follows
suit. Of course, forcible hand-feeding becomes necessary for some
time till the new bird reconciles itself to its diet.
Although we have reasons to wonder over the rare achievements
of these unlettered professionals, we can easily guess the motive which

Food Problem in Aviculture under Indian Conditions 805
spurs them to these occasional outbursts of ingenuity in the matter
of keeping alive the wild and newly caught insectivorous Indian birds,
viz., their greed for money-making. Hardly in all India will one meet
with an unselfish aviculturist really worthy of the name. True, the
craze amongst the Indians for cage-birds and other captive pets is
as strong as among the inhabitants of many European countries,
but the " fancy " chiefly consists in keeping a few birds of song or
colour confined to a small cage and wrapped up carefully with one or
two pieces of clean linen. Thus the Nightingale, Koel, Hawk Cuckoo,
the Indian Plaintive Cuckoo, Common or Pied or Hill Mynah,
a few species of Parrots, the Indian Bulbul, the Shama or Dhayal,
sometimes a Kastura, a few Munias, or very rarely a Singing Bush
Lark or the Crested Chendool are all that close the list of the Indian
bird pets which are looked upon as the special subjects for the cage.
That the caging of birds could have any ulterior purpose like the
study of their habits, etc., which might add to human knowledge
is unknown to the people of India, and they hardly understand or
conceive the knotty problems as regards food, etc., which still baffle
the expert aviculturist.
With this survey of Indian conditions and the growing bird trade
in India, despite the local apathy towards the " hobby ", it would
not be out of place to record the experience of one who has drunk
deep the Western spirit of scientific aviculture. My devotion to my
hobby covers well over a period of fifteen years; and during this period
I have had under my observation mostly the smaller Indian insectivorous
birds like Mgiihina tiphia , Chloropsis aurifrons , Sturnia malabarica ,
Molpastes leucotis, Copsychus saularis , Cittocinda macrura , Merula
unicolour , etc., all of which attempted to breed and rear young in my
aviaries. Without recounting the experiments which at&apos; first proved
futile, I think it best without much ado to confine the attention of
my readers to the crux of the whole thing, viz., the problem of food
and food supply in the different seasons in the solution of which alone
lies the secret of success. As I stated before, the supply of insect
food in India is restricted to maggots- which are reared in horse or
cow dung by a class of professional bird-food suppliers, and a limited
number of live grasshoppers. Minced meat is also catered for. But

the staple diet remains satoo and ghee mixed together. This diet,
so far as my experience goes, might hold good for a caged specimen
covered up day and night with linen in order to provide warmth and
stimulation for song; but it would never do for a mixed company
of birds kept in a spacious aviary provided with all the amenities
which the modern experience in aviculture dictates. This ration can
never afford sufficient nourishment during the rainy season and cold
weather months ; besides, its value as diet for the young during the
breeding period is absolutely nil. Even if one adds egg-food and bread
and milk sop with ripe fruits, matters will not improve. My experience
with this diet with the Australian Finches, which require insect food
during the nesting season, is not encouraging at all. During my
experiments I wished vainly for the varied menu of insects such as
is obtainable in England and Europe, e.g. mealworms, ants' eggs,
and other prepared insectivorous food. Once I tried live crickets
(and parenthetically I may mention here that, although India is rich
in insect fauna, it is very difficult to get insects under the conditions
prevailing in a city like Calcutta), and to my utter disappointment
and mortification killed the three well-grown youngsters, almost
wholly feathered, of a pair of Shamas breeding within the hollow of
a bamboo pole hung up against my aviary wall! Since then I determined
to set my face against this class of insects, and the idea suddenly
flashed in my mind of trying with the larva and jpujpa of a class of
red ants known as (Ecophylla smaragdina which build among green
leaves. Almost an unlimited supply of these insects could be had
from my suburban country house, which contains an extensive grove
of trees and shrubs. There is a dearth of these ants during the hot
months, but otherwise for the rest of the year a continual supply may
be obtained. Experimenting with these grubs I obtained results as
good as I could look for, although sometimes I felt tempted to believe
that the ration, unless provided in measured quantities, led to over-
stimulation of the nesting couples, which in one instance showed
an unusual desire to commence nesting operations but little attempt
to brood the eggs.
The nest of the red ants contains not only the larvae and pupae
but also a number of workers and adult ants which can with difficulty

be separated from these so-called eggs (the real eggs can hardly be
seen with the naked eye). These adult ants are also eaten by some
of the hardier birds which take the precaution of beating them against
the feathers of their wings or tail before devouring them. As I have
mentioned before, this insect food if supplied with caution forms
a valuable asset in the menu not only of insectivorous birds but of
the Seed-eaters and delicate Finches, especially in the breeding season.
With the aid of this insect diet my pair of Shamas could rear their
broods successfully. Their first clutch of eggs began on the 13th May,
1923. One egg was destroyed. On the 27th the first young one was
hatched and two more followed the next day. One of these died
and was removed from the nest by the mother. On the 8th June the
two surviving nestlings were completely feathered, and the next day
when they left their nest I confined them in a large cage with their
mother until they were able to feed themselves independently of the
latter's help. Since the very birth of the young Shamas, I found the
mother bird showing great care and discrimination in picking up
the appropriate food for her offspring. For the first two or three days
after the young were hatched she would touch nothing but ants' eggs
(larvae and pupae of (E. smaragdina) ; after that period she would take
a few of the smaller green grasshoppers in addition to ants' eggs.
Not until a fortnight after their birth did the mother give them a bit
of the artificial menu --satoo and ghee mixed with minced carrot and
yolk of fowl's egg.
The aforesaid larva food helped my Dhyal to rear her two young
ones very successfully. Two or three days before the hatching of the
eggs the only precaution I took (dictated by my previous experience)
was to confine the cock bird in a wire cage hung up within the same
aviary in which the female was incubating. In this case I saw hardly
any necessity for supplying a varied insect menu. A daily supply
of the ant larvae in gradually increasing quantities gave the best
results. Of the non-insect diet, varied as it was to meet the needs
of a heterogenous group of birds located in the same aviary, the Dhyal
never showed its dislike for the staple satoo diet mixed with some
yolk of fowl's eggs ; but how far it relied on this in the matter of
feeding its young soon after they were hatched it is hard to say. The

efficacy of the larva diet can easily be realized when we find the Dhyal
chicks could fly out of their nursery (within a hole in the western
wall of the aviary) only a little over a fortnight after they were hatched
(date of hatching, 4th May, 1924 ; date when the young came out of
nest, 20th May, 1924).
The red ants' eggs proved in several instances the most wholesome
diet for my couple of Grey Partridges during the periods when their
young ones were hatched. A pair of Sturnia malabarica, which were
able to rear their young three times in my aviary, were observed to
count to a great extent on this ration while the parents had to find
food to bring up their new-born babes. It is worthy of note that
non-insect food, like bread and milk sop or ripe fruit, was never discarded
as unwholesome at this period, morsels of which, together with ants'
eggs and maggots, were given regularly to the young by their parents.
Fruit-eating birds like the Bulbuls, Molpastes leucotis, M. leucogenys,
Otocompsa emeria, displayed a wonderful fondness for the larva food
exclusively for the first three or four days after the hatching of their
young in my aviary. In another instance a pair of Molpastes leucotis
gave preferential attention to the softer crickets and green grasshoppers,
discarding the ants' eggs when their two young ones were six days old.
This diet of red ants' eggs, as I observed in many cases, gives a
stimulus to many shy couples to think about nesting. Being fed on
this diet, Chloropsis aurifrons --a record of whose breeding in captivity
hardly exists--developed an inclination to nest so that I had a rare
opportunity of observing the courting habits of the male bird.
Unfortunately the sudden death of the female, due to an accident,
cut short my prospect of further observation. Another shy couple,
Merula unicolor (I might mention that both the birds were specially
caught for my aviary and steadied by me), which met with many
rebuffs from a bullying pair of Copsychus saularis, went to nest on
the top of a bamboo pole hung on the north wall of the chamber
in which they were housed and had three eggs which proved clear not
once but three times, much to my chagrin and utter disappointment.
I hope I shall have better fortune with this pair next time. A pair of
Ioras ( Mgithina tiphia) --both of them hand-reared--came into my
possession during the fag-end of the last breeding season (1924).

Food Problem in Aviculture under Indian Conditions 309
Having had a regular supply of the ants' eggs, the male developed its
native courting instinct and went through the faery antics, ejaculations
and mellowed whistles so characteristic of this bird during the mating
season. The female was appreciative of all this attention, and attempted
to build a nest of fine coir. Unhappily her prospect was marred,
partly due to the lateness of the season and partly owing to unsuitability
of the place which she selected for her nest.
It may not be known to many of my readers that the Iora is far
too delicate a subject for a cage, so much so that notwithstanding
Finn's meagre record nothing is known regarding its life in captivity.
In India, too, it is a rara avis for the cage-bird fancier. Happily my
pair are in perfect breeding condition now, and I have already given
them a spacious flight with shrubs and foliage, and expect better luck
this time. I succeeded in hand-rearing two extra Iora nestlings mainly
with ants' eggs, both of which are females and now grown up into
healthy birds. It is worthy of note that once acclimatized and reconciled
to captivity the Iora becomes quite hardy and is capable of holding
its own in a mixed company.
I perceived the effect of the larva diet in the two striking cases
where a pair of Chendool (Galerita cristata ) and a pair of White Wagtails
(Motacilla alba dukkunensis) thought of housekeeping and made abortive
attempts at site selecting. The Ttain Quail (Coturnix coromandelica)
laid several eggs within its nest in a box, and the male bird's quaint
manner of puffing itself out and uttering a reverberating sound not
only captivated the attention of its mate but its human warder also.
This note is peculiar to the breeding period.
The possibilities of the larva diet are well demonstrated in the
several instances mentioned above. The fact that it is hard to get within
the town of Calcutta and can never be had from the professional bird-
food supplier does not detract from its supreme efficacy. A little
search will soon reveal that there is an unlimited source of supply
lying untapped near at hand in the suburbs. An aviculturist in India,
situated as he is, must take pains to devise ways and means to get
at the appropriate food for his birds ; and his outings for this purpose
to neighbouring rural areas are never expensive but are likely to confer
incalculable good on his body and mind.

By Sydney Porter.
(Continued from p. 272)
Giant Kingfishers (Ceryle maxima ) seem to prefer the thick woods
and forests that border on the rivers and streams rather than the more
open parts. Always on the look-ont for that arch-enemy of the bird
world--man--if they see you there is a whirr of wings and they are
gone. Sometimes, in a shady nook in a mimosa wood through which
runs a clear, fast-flowing stream, I have watched these Kingfishers
who, with the Pittas, seem to reign supreme in the green twilight,
the whole demeanour of the former seemed to be dominated by nervous
anxiety.
The colour of the bird is blackish-grey on the upper parts, the wings,
and tail, and spotted with white. The head feathers are elongated
and form a full bushy crest which is usually compressed, and only in
odd moments of relaxation on the bird's part is it noticeable. The
throat is a mixture of black and white, the lower parts rich rufous.
The female differs in having the upper part of the breast white with
a band of black spots across. The bill in both sexes is black.
The nesting habits and also the manner of fishing resemble those
of its pied congenitor. There is one curious thing that I have sometimes
noticed, that is, when the birds have been disturbed near their nesting-
place, they would fly on to a small twig that grew out of the main
trunk of a mimosa-tree and would apparently disappear, but upon
close examination one found that the plumage of the bird harmonized
so well with the lichen-spotted bark of the tree that the bird was
rendered quite inconspicuous. This is the first time I have seen
protective coloration in Kingfishers.
The Black-collared Barbet (Lybius torquatus) is fairly common
in certain localities, especially around wooded kopjes where wild fruit
trees are plentiful.
A bird about the size of the English Thrush but more stoutly built,
a greyish-brown in colour, mottled with yellow on the back and wings,
pale yellow below. The front part of the head, cheeks, and throat
bright crimson, bordered behind with a broad collar of glossy black.

The flight feathers faintly edged with yellow, the secondaries broadly so.
The two central tail-feathers black, edged with yellow. The rest
greyish-brown. The thick, stout beak, black. Both sexes are similar.
For their size these birds have enormous vocal powers, and when
a flock alights near at hand the noise is incredible. They live in small
troops of about a dozen or less, never wandering far from their regular
haunts, subsisting upon wild fruit and berries and no doubt, to a lesser
degree, upon insects.
I have seen them feeding upon the small, round, and plush-like green
unripe berries of an unnamed shrub. Their actions whilst feeding are
very Parrot-like.
The nest is made in a hole in a tree, which the birds excavate
themselves. This is a work of great patience on their part, as they do
not chip the wood away as in the case of the Woodpeckers or Parrots,
but gradually wear it away with a constant motion of the beak.
The birds will make a small hole first into a tree that some mysterious
instinct tells them is hollow, and enlarge it from the inside. I have
seen the hen with a good deal of squeezing get inside the hole and
enlarge the entrance with a systematic semi-circular movement of
the beak for half an hour at a time, the only part of her being visible
was her bright red head. Sometimes she would stop her work and gaze
at me with her beady black eyes.
There were two charming little Warblers of species quite new
to me, the first a tiny creature the size of a Goldcrest with a long
graduated tail that was kept in constant motion. In colour it was
mouse-grey above and pure white below, the throat being divided
from the breast by a thin black line. This tiny Warbler was one of
the most fearless birds that I ever came across : whenever it saw a
human being its curiosity would get the better of it and it would come
within a few feet, viewing one from every possible angle, uttering all
the time its sweet call-note.
The other was the Crombec Warbler (Sylviella rufescens), a
perfect replica in colour and size of a Nuthatch, perhaps very slightly
paler. It appeared to have no tail, but on close examination it could
be seen but was so short that it was hidden by the tail-coverts; the beak
was long and slender and slightly curved.

Sydney Porter--Notes from Rhodesia
These birds associate in small parties of from four to ten
systematically searching every leaf, branch, nook, and cranny for
insects, usually minute ones, upon which they subsist.
Of all the elusive birds that T came across, the Angolian Pitta (Pitta
angolensis) was perhaps the worst. It is so unobtrusive that very
few white people in the part where I lived knew of its existence, and
I am sure that when I described it to them they thought that I had
pictured to them a bird of my imagination.
The following is a description of one of the most brilliantly plumaged
birds in Rhodesia, the head straw-coloured with longitudinal stripes
of black, the breast straw colour, and the under parts bright scarlet,
the wings and upper back rich dark green, the wing marked with
lazuline blue, the lower back also green, the tail dark green, the tail-
coverts sky blue. A very noticeable feature is the large deep brown
eye. The Pittas, as though conscious of the conspicuous colouring,
frequent the dense undergrowth, seldom venturing out into the open.
They seem, to be equally terrestrial and aboreal, they seldom make
long flights, only flying from branch to branch or tree to tree ; it is
when in flight that the scarlet under parts are so conspicuous, at other
times if they see that they are being watched they will turn their
green backs, which harmonize so well with, the surrounding foliage,
towards one, and watch with their heads turned completely round.
To watch these birds in their native haunts requires great patience.
The best w T ay is to move as slowly and quietly as possible through the
woods with ears alert for the sound of the rustling of dead leaves.
As soon as one hears that they should remain perfectly quiet and
'watch, and soon the eye will catch sight of the scarlet breast of our
little friend as he runs here and there, with his stumpy tail bobbing
up and down, systematically turning over the dead leaves, very much
in the same manner as the English Blackbird, searching for insects
upon which he feeds.
This Pitta is found in Equatorial Africa, seldom wandering further
south than the Zambezi.
A pair will haunt a certain spot for a time and then suddenly
disappear entirely from the neighbourhood. I know- nothing of their
nesting habits.

During my sojourn in Rhodesia I was singularly fortunate in seeing
over 200 different species of birds that I was able to recognize,
and many species that, of course, I was not able to. These latter
included many small Warblers and Finches, many of which I think
are unnamed. I was lucky in seeing all the species that I had previously
desired to see, including the Ground Hornbill, the Pittas, Woodhoopers,
the Crowned Cranes, and last but not least the Great African Bustard
(Otis Icori), or " Gom Paauw " as it is called in Africa. This bird is rapidly
being exterminated in Africa, and its total extinction will only be a
matter of a few more years unless some drastic measures are taken for
its protection. It is nowhere common, and many old Rhodesians
have only seen it but a few times in their lives.
Its extermination from an economic point of view is greatly to be
deplored owing to its feeding upon great quantities of locusts, grass-
hoppers and other obnoxious insects, but owing to the fact that it goes
under the nomenclature of game birds and its being greatly esteemed
for the pot, and, last but not least, to its large size, for it is the longest
South African bird after the Ostrich, it is shot without mercy wherever
it is found.
In Rhodesia solitary individuals are found roaming the country,
seldom remaining long in one place, always shy, wary and suspicious ;
it is impossible to get within more than several hundred yards of them,
and it will see one long before one sees it. When approached it will
at first walk quietly away, but on nearer approach it will run several
yards and then take wing. On hot days I have seen birds panting and
gasping with the exertion of having to run, but when once on the wing
the flight is by no means laboured or heavy, but consists of leisured,
easy wing-beats ; sometimes the bird will sail for a considerable distance.
When startled it will fly about a quarter of a mile before settling.
In colour the Great Bustard is a mixture of brown, white and black ;
the feathers of the head, which are black, are elongated and form a
full loose crest; the under parts are white. The neck feathers are
long and loose.
The female is similar in plumage but, as in the European Bustard,
is considerably smaller than her mate.
The Great Bustard inhabits the dry open veldt, and sometimes

Sydney Porter--Notes from Bhodesia
when the grass is high and the bird partially concealed I have mistaken
it for a small buck.
The eggs are laid on the bare ground with no pretence of a nest,
are large, mottled, olive brown. The Black Kite (Milvus korschun)
is fairly common, much to the chagrin of the farmers, for it is rather
partial to Chickens and other small domestic birds, and therefore
is shot on every occasion, which seems rather a pity because it must
do a considerable amount of good in other ways by feeding upon rats,
snakes, locusts, etc. It is easily distinguished on the wing from other
birds of prey by its uniform dark brown colouring and by its com-
paratively long slightly forked tail which seems to be on a swivel, as
it is always rotating from side to side when the bird is in flight.
Sometimes I have seen an individual bird hanging almost motionless
in the air in a flock of flying ants, catching them with its feet and
transferring them leisurely to its mouth.
The well-known Secretary Bird (Serpentarius secretarius) is to be
seen fairly often, but cannot be regarded as common. A pair frequented
a large paddock about a mile from the homestead where I was staying,
where they could usually be seen making a systematic but dignified
search of the ground for their food.
Secretary Birds are usually found in pairs, though I have occasionally
seen odd birds on the veldt.
At a distance these birds look remarkable Crane-like both in regard
to their gait and general demean our. They will allow of a near approach,
but when they think one has come far enough they will walk leisurely
away, and it is only when one comes within close proximity that they
take flight, flying perhaps 50 yards and then settling.
It is very much to be regretted that the protection afforded to
this unique bird by the Rhodesian Government has been relaxed owing
to the fact that it is said to occasionally eat small buck, but surely
any trespass in this way is fully compensated by the sterling service
that it renders by the destruction of snakes and obnoxious insects, etc.
But although the protection has been relaxed I do not think that
it is shot to any great extent.
I am sure that the Secretary Bird is too well known to need a
description. The most noticeable features are the long grey and black

feathers of unequal length that spring from the back of the head
and the extremely long central tail-feathers.
This bird is distributed over nearly the whole of South Africa,
excepting the damp or forest regions. Usually the birds will attack
a snake with their feet and trample it to death, using their wings as a
shield, but it is a well-known fact that they will seize a snake, fly
high into the air, and let it drop upon some rock. I have never seen
this done myself, but I have been assured that it is quite true.
The nest, which is a huge flat-topped affair, composed of sticks,
sods, etc., is usually placed on the top of a thick spreading tree. The
eggs are two or three in number, and are a bluish-white colour.
The Snake Bird or Darter (Plotus rufus) is extremely common
around the rivers in Rhodesia, and is seen usually sitting solitary
on an exposed branch of a dead tree overhanging the water. In size
and shape it is rather reminiscent of a Cormorant, but is of a more
slender build. It is perfectly at home in the water, and is, as far
as my observation goes, almost entirely aquatic, for even though it
perches in trees it never seems to move about in them; it is never
seen on land, and rises straight out of the water wdien disturbed.
It swims with' the body entirely submerged, only the long thin neck
and head being visible above the water : it is then that the bird lias a
very reptilian look, especially when the narrow head is swayed from
side to side in the manner of a snake.
It dives with great agility, and transfixes its prey, which consists
of fish, with its dagger-like beak.
Black is the principal colour of this bird, the scapular feathers,
which are long and pointed, and the lesser and medium wing-coverts
have a central white stripe, the greater wing-coverts are dark bronze.
There is a narrow white band bordering the throat and forehead-;
the lower throat and neck are rufous, and the bare throat is creamy
white.
The nest, which is a rough and bulky structure of sticks, is placed
in the fork of a tree overhanging the water. The eggs, which are from
three to five in number, resemble those of a Cormorant.
A very well-known bird in Rhodesia is the Pale Harrier (Circus
macrnrus), well known because of its conspicuousness and not because

it is very common. At first sight one would be liable to mistake it
for a Seagull. The adult male is a beautiful silver grey in colour, with
the primary wing-feathers black, and is a conspicuous object in the
landscape, sailing with easy and graceful flight, resembling a Seagull
more than a Hawk, at no great distance above the ground, searching
for its prey, which consists of rats, mice, small birds, large insects,
lizards, frogs, etc. Sometimes when flying past the dark green m'sarsa-
trees it appears white. The females and immature males are a brownish
colour, marked with black, and one sees birds in all stages of transitory
plumage. They appear to be migratory, as I have never seen them
in the winter time.
The Black-breasted Harrier Eagle is a large and majestic bird,
superior in size to the Golden Eagle. It is frequently seen with huge
upturned, outstretched, motionless wings soaring at a great height,
the pure white breast gleaming in the sunlight.
I have spent many fascinating hours watching with a pair of
binoculars this grand bird searching for its prey, sweeping round and
round in vast circles, sometimes only a few yards from the ground,
the bright, gleaming, cruel eye ever on the watch for the slightest
movement in the grass beneath.
This Eagle is very often mistaken for its congener the Martial
Eagle (Eutolmaetus bellicosus), which though found in Rhodesia is
comparatively rare, but it can easily be distinguished as the Black-
breasted Harrier Eagle is much darker in colour. " Black-breasted "
is rather a misnomer, as it is only the throat and upper breast that is
black, the whole under parts being snow-white with the exception
of a few black markings on the flanks.
The Egrets, to my way of thinking, are the acme of grace and
beauty, as anyone who has studied them in their natural haunts will
verify. I have had the good fortune of being able to observe these
birds at very close quarters. Rhodesia boasts of several species of
these lovely birds, the commonest species being the Buff-backed
Egret (Bubulcus ibis), locally designated the White Tick Bird.
In marshy places, in the vast malarial swamps, by the side of
rivers or streams, or wherever herds of cattle are providing they are
not too far from water, these birds will be found in flocks, comprising

sometimes hundreds of individuals. In summer time one seldom sees
a flock of cattle without a flock of these birds in attendance, running
in and out between the legs of the cattle, feeding not so much upon the
ticks that infest the cattle as upon the insects that are disturbed as
the beasts walk about.
One of the red-letter days of my stay in Rhodesia was when I
discovered the roosting-place of the Egrets. In the evenings I had seen
flock after flock winging its way down the river valley in an endless
procession for perhaps over an hour, so one day I set out, tramping
many miles down-stream in search of their night abode, thinking
naturally that it would be some giant tree, easily discernible because
of the accumulation of feathers and excrement underneath, but as
evening came on and I was unable to find my objective I retraced my
footsteps, disappointed at my failure ; but when about a mile from the
starting point I noticed in the river two huge white objects that I
had not seen before ; they looked like trees covered with snow, and
upon approaching I soon saw that this was indeed the roosting-place
of the Egrets.
There were thousands and thousands of them, and they completely
covered two mimosa-trees in the river, and at a distance it was impossible
to see anything of the trees. As I came within about fifty yards the
whole flock took flight; the roar made by simultaneous flight of the
birds was incredible. The entire flock circled round for some time,
and as I moved away settled down again on the trees with the usual
bickerings and squabblings for places.
Since then I spent many pleasant hours in the proximity of those
two trees. I was able to creep within quite close quarters, and with
the aid of a pair of binoculars I could observe the birds as though they
were only a yard or two away.
These beautiful creatures must be seen in their natural environ-
ment to be really appreciated. The graceful contour of the relaxed
bird in its filmy nuptial plumage is a feast to the eye ; there is something
about it that gives the impression of being too ethereal for the sordid
mundane world.
Every now and again the filmy scapular plumes are raised and
expanded so as to form a cascade over the back, and at the same time
the elongated feathers on the head and neck are expanded.

I once thought that if only the females who deck their head-dresses
with the feathers of these birds could but see them, so full of graceful
vivacity, in the perfect setting beside the lotus river, they would relent
and demand no more the product for which such bloody toll has to be
paid--but, alas, I have been disillusioned.
The Buff-backed Egret is a migrant arriving in the early spring
(September) and leaving in the autumn (April) for its breeding grounds
in Europe and Northern Africa. When the birds arrive they are in
the pure white undress plumage but shortly before they leave they
assume the pinky-yellow feathers of the nuptial plumage.
One usually finds a small number of Snake Birds roosting with
the Egrets, making a strange contrast.
The Great White Egret (Herodias alba) is sometimes seen, but
it is never common. One usually sees a single pair inhabiting a marsh,
and while one is feeding the other is keeping watch so that it is impossible
to get very close up. No doubt this shyness is due in a great extent
to the persecution it has received on account of its highly prized nuptial
plumes, and although it is protected, great quantities of feathers
are smuggled out of the country, especially from the Belgian Congo.
One never sees this Egret in the company of cattle like its smaller
congener, but it keeps exclusively to the marshes and pools. It is
also a migrant, arriving about September or October and leaving
in March or April.
The Little Egret (Herodias garzetta) and the Yellow-billed Egret
(H. brachyrhyncha) are also occasionally seen in the large swamps,
but are far from common. Their habits resemble those of their larger
cousin, the Great White Egret.

two or tliree other sentences quite distinctly. They were very tame,
and suffered Mr. Hedges, who had charge of them, to handle them
freely. While not exactly afraid of them myself, I still have considerable
respect for their powerful beaks, and if I want to shift them from one
aviary or cage to another I prefer to get them to take hold of a stick,
on which they can be carried anywhere. It is only necessary to catch
one, as they are inseparable, and will follow each other everywhere.
In spite of their habit of screaming they are most charming little birds,
and I think one of the prettiest of the Conures. I think with a little
trouble that they could be made quite good talkers. My birds are in
an outdoor aviary, and have little chance of picking up fresh phrases
or sentences. The only thing they have.learnt since I have had them
is to exactly imitate the cackling of a hen that has just laid an egg.
This is not exactly musical, but it is a change from their natural scream.
No doubt they think that having produced eggs themselves they
have as much right to cackle as any old hen has. Quite early in
June they took possession of one of my nesting-boxes, and on the 16th
the first egg was laid. Four was the clutch, and of these two were
hatched on or about the 19th July. I was away on holiday at the time,
so cannot describe the young ones in down. When I returned and
went to examine them, the cock greeted me wdth " I'm a very good girl "
and " I'm your sweetheart ", but the hen was silent, and as she
pitched upon my head and began to take an interest in my ears,
the glance I had at the young ones was only cursory. As far as
I could see they were covered with greenish down, the heads only
being feathered. They were then about three weeks old. A fortnight
later I had another look, they were then feathered nearly all over,
those on the back and wings being marked very much like those of
the Lineated Parrakeet, with faint transverse barrings. On
1st September I had another look, as I thought it about time they
should leave the nest. On lifting the lid of the box both birds flew
out. They were quite strong on the wing. To my surprise the barrings
on the upper feathers had disappeared and they were a uniform bright
green all over, and but for their smaller size could not be distinguished
from my White-eyed Parrots (Conurus leucophthalmus). I suppose
that they will not get their red heads until their second or third year.

320 J. Delacour--Bird Breeding at Gleres in 1925
Writing of these birds in the Avicultural Magazine , 1st Series,
Yol. YI, Mr. Goodfellow says : 45 These birds I saw offered for sale
in Guayaquil at 5 s. each, and no doubt at half that price they could
have been bought. Being rather large birds they show oh their colour
to advantage. I imagine though that they must be rather noisy birds
to keep, for they have a disagreeable shriek. They ought not to be
at all delicate for we shot specimens near the volcano of Parace by
Popayan in Columbia, at an altitude of over 8,000 feet. In passing
through the little village of Carmen on our ride from Buenaventura
to Cali, we saw the sam# birds in immense clouds coming from their
feeding grounds in the high mountain forests to pass the night in the
little sheltered valleys below. Carmen could boast of little else in the
way of vegetation, but bamboos which grew in great thickets, and every
branch of these giant grasses was literally weighing down with its burden
of C. rubrolarvatus. The noise was simply deafening. Those we shot
by the acid waterfall of Parace in the month of May, 1898, were
undoubtedly nesting in the crevices of the perpendicular cliffs there;
for on the report of our firearms numbers of them flew out screaming
from the holes and ledges around. I noticed too that the plumage of
some was draggled evidently by sitting on their eggs. 5 '

The past breeding season has been rather successful. June and
July were very fine, and when the bad weather set in, in August and
September, many young birds were already strong enough to stand it.
It is true to say that our little valley is as wet and chilly at night,
especially in the summer, as the worst English ones, and precautions
must be taken, especially with freshly imported birds, which never
ought to be allowed to sleep out of doors during their first summer
with us ; but now they are acclimatized most birds are living and
breeding well. On the other hand, our winters are generally mild and
animals and birds do not suffer during the cold months. However,
a few birds have proved impossible to keep in good health out of

Full details of the young birds have been given in UOiseau
(1925, Nos. 10 and 11), and I shall only quote here the most interesting-
facts.
The greatest success was the first breeding in Europe of the
rare Pheasants which I brought from Indo-China in 1924. Out of
three pairs only one of Edward's Pheasants bred, laying three clutches,
the second pair laid but two eggs, and the third none at all. A
surplus cock Edward's mated to a Swinhoe's hen produced a pair
of hybrids. A curious fact is that, although the Edward's Pheasant
is a close relation of the Swinhoe's, its incubation is but tw^enty-
one days, instead of twenty-five with all other Hierophasis and
Gennceus, and also that the young birds take their full adult plumage
at the first moult and are like the adults when six months old; they
very likely breed the first year. I always suspected it, as I had never
captured or heard of an immature specimen in the autumn or winter
in Annam.
The rare Imperial Pheasants gave three young ones, but two met
with accident, and only one, a female, was reared. The incubation
period is of twenty-five days. The two pairs of Bell's Pheasants gave
three and two clutches, and five pairs were reared. It is a very
scarce bird in its natural haunts, only found on a few higher hills
over 5,000 feet of altitude. It is darker and finer than the Silver,
and just as hardy and robust. It had been bred before in the Paris
Museum Menagerie, from the type specimen, between 1898
and 1903, but none were surviving after 1913. It has never figured
in any other public or private collection. My Argus, although in
perfect condition, stupidly laid in the winter, and the eggs proved
unfertile. Different Firebacks--Bornean (nobilis), Vieillot's, Crestless
*--have not laid yet, but I have good acclimatized pairs which ought

to breed next season. A very interesting new race, of which a pair
has been sent to me by my friend, Professor A. Ghigi, of Bologna,
has been named by him after me, Lophura sumatrana delacouri;
it resembles in every way the Bornean bird ( L . ignita), but shows the
pure white central tail-feathers of the Vieillot's (A. rufa).
My only Javan Jungle hen, imported last spring, did not lay, but
I breed a good many young hybrids, and hope to build up in a few
years a good strain of practically pure birds from half-bred pullets
and pure Javan cocks, of which I possess three beauties ; Javan
hens are almost never imported, as bird-catchers do not care to
trap them on account of their dull plumage.
Interesting additions to the Duck collection have been Eiders and
Cotton Teal; two pinioned pairs of the latter are now on the lake.
The scarce Chestnut-breasted Teal, of which I have two drakes
and five females (adult), have produced three young ones in the
spring, all females ; seven more were hatched in August, three of
them only surviving the exceptionally cold and wet weather we had,
and four more were hatched in September ; three of them can be
considered as safe now. The fourth one had been overlooked, and
remained a few days on the lake, then disappeared ; the drake
always kept with the mother, an uncommon habit with Ducks,
and looked very carefully after the young one, attacking other
Waterfowl which came too near. It is most annoying that, through
inbreeding, the percentage of females is so high among the young
birds ; but I hope to have at least two drakes in other youngsters.
I have recently received Great Bustards from Spain, through the
kind help of Captain and Mrs. R. Paget, and they make a very
valuable and long-desired addition to the bird collection.
I have been rather successful with Budgerigars ; a good number
have been bred from a mixture of Blue, Olive, Green, and Yellows,
ten pairs altogether ; about twenty Blues were reared, but I was
lucky enough to obtain five Cobalt or Mauve without ever having
had to purchase any of this pretty but costly variety. They have
been produced, I think, by Greens issued from Olive cocks and Blue
hens.

and Doves, breeding amongst others Geotrygon caniceps for the first
time in Europe ; four young have been reared so far; she also
bred the Plumed Ground Dove and has two pairs of Bartlett's
Bleeding-hearts incubating now. As usual, M. Deeoux bred many
Finches, Parrakeets, and Doves ; he had several broods of Parrots,
Finches, and also some G. caniceps , after several failures; his best
success has been the breeding of two Silver-eared Mesias, which
species had never been reared completely before, as the young ones
had always died after a few days out of the nest. M. Decoux's
birds cannot be distinguished now from the parents. Both
Mme. Lecallier and M. Deeoux have bred Blue Robins and Shamas
this year.

Sir, --I purchased a pair of Bayard's Bulbul (Pycnonotus layardi)
last spring, and turned them out in one of my large aviaries with a good
many other birds. In May they built a nest in a Portugal laurel
and laid two eggs. Both of these were clear. The next nest was
built on some faggots in the indoor aviary. Soon there were two
hungry young ones looking over the nest, and the parents fed them
all day long. Unfortunately the cock bird died, but the hen took
full charge and reared the young ones successfully. As one had
a deformed leg I destroyed it, but the other is perfect and looks
exactly like the parents. This bird comes from Africa and makes
a splendid aviary bird. Colour, olive brown with a darker head and
a yellow vent. I believe this bird was bred some years ago by
Dr. Amsler, but the event was not recorded.

beginning to sing at the time of writing, 30th August.
On this the Editor (a Thomas, as we most are, in regard to this
cross) comments as follows :--
" This is really a most remarkable achievement of Herr DisselhofPs
--Chaffinch-Canary hybrids on the wing--for although eggs and
nestlings have frequently been reported, none have till now been
known to have been reared, and any records of such must, as Barth
in his book Mule-breeding says, be received with the greatest caution,
particularly the one, which appears in one book, of six broods of
these hybrids, one after the other."
We must agree and hope for further details and additional
evidence.

DEFECTIVE BUDGERIGARS

Sir,--I shall be much obliged if you will be so kind as to answer
the following query !
I have purchased a fine adult Olive Cock Budgerigar, and also
a hen blue. The latter bird I- got cheaply, as it has deformed wings.
The man I bought it from tells me that this is due to inbreeding,
is that so ? The only thing that is wrong with her is that the flight
feathers have not grown. Do you consider that these will come
right when she moults, or not ? If not, do you know of anything
I can do for her to improve them and is she likely to breed in this
condition ? I should be obliged if you will also kindly give me as
full details as possible as to the best diet for them. Though I have
kept Budgerigars for years, and been very successful with them,
these are the first of the more valuable varieties that I have had and
I wish to do the best for them I can.
Thos. L. S. Dooly.
[Budgerigars with defective flight-feathers or no flights at all are
not likey to recover these feathers and are useless for breeding.
It is a condition popularly known as " French Moult ", to which
Budgerigars are subject, especially when they have been bred under
very artificial conditions, and the blue variety which is often in-bred
and lacks the stamina of the normally-coloured bird is particularly
liable to it.
Budgerigars should be fed upon sound canary-seed and spray
millet and given plenty of green food, especially flowering grass and
chickweed, and when there are young to be fed stale bread soaked
in cold water and squeezed out is useful. We believe that some
breeders of Blues add a small quantity of good insectivorous food
to their diet. Cuttle-fish bone should always be supplied.-- Ed.]
