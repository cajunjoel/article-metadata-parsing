BREEDING THE FULVOUS-FRONTED PARROTBILL
by M. &amp; N. Curzon

<bodyText confidence="0.996996266666667" page_id="56285787"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
The Fulvous-fronted Parrotbill Paradoxornis fulvifrons is a very small
bird, only about 12cm (4in) long, half of which is accounted for by the tail.
It is among the smallest of the 19 members of the Parrotbill family, of which
the best known is the Bearded Reedling Panurus biarmicus. The Fulvous-
fronted Parrotbill is recognisable by its very short, globular bill (hence the
name Parrotbill) and general fulvous coloured plumage, with an eye stripe
extending to the nape, and a grey belly which at times looks almost whitish.
Colour illustrations of this species can be seen in Birds of Sikkim and the
Handbook of the Birds of India and Pakistan (compact edition), neither of
which are very true to life, for the live birds are very slender. They are
found from south-eastern Tibet and eastern Nepal, through Sikkim and into
China. There is the nominate form and three races, but we are unsure to
which of these our birds belong. They were bought in February 1995 as
'Grey-cheeked' Parrotbills.
One needs to be very careful when catching and handling them. They
are very quick, especially when moving around the aviary. There they spend
a great deal of time in the bushes and as they clamber about remind you of
mice running along the branches. Their diet consists of finely chopped
fruit, insectivorous mixture and mini mealworms. Generally a dish of nectar
is also available and they have been seen to take some. After being kept in
a flight cage they were put outside in the summer of 1995. They shared the
aviary with some Red Avadavats Amandava amandava. This is the same
aviary (14ft x 12ft x 8ft high (approx. 4.2m x 3.6m x 2.4m high)) in which
in 1989 the late Donald Risdon bred the Royal or Golden-breasted Starling
Cosmopsarus regius. The parrotbills nested in a box bush 1ft (30.5cm)
from the central path in the aviary and 1ft (30.5cm) above the ground.
However, the nest built mainly using coconut fibre, together with the eggs
were washed away during a thunderstorm, after which there was no further
nesting activity in 1995.
The following year there was no nesting activtiy due to the fact that they

were housed in a 3ft x 3ft x 6ft high (approx. 0.9m x 0.9m x 1.8m high)
flight, within the aviary in which we bred the Yellow-fronted Tinkerbird
Pogoniulus chrysoconus. This aviary was constructed principally to house
new arrivals, where perhaps a new mate can be put to see how an original
inmate reacts to it, or where an aggressive bird can be put perhaps to reduce
its level of condition. The parrotbills spent time here due to the fact that we
hoped to breed from our Red-headed Tits Aegithalos concinnus , but they
disappeared due perhaps to vermin.
On Saturday, 15th March 1997 the parrotbills were let into the main
flight and started calling immediately. Within a few days they had started to
build a nest but it took almost a month to complete, the same length of time
that it took the bush, a shrubby honeysuckle, to thicken up after its winter
pruning. The nest was 3?. ft (approx 1.1m) above the ground, 1ft (30.5cm)
from the wire and 4ft (approx. 1.2m) from the birdroom wall.On the morning
of Tuesday, 29th April five blue eggs were found. They were very beautiful
and looked like those of the Dunnock Prunella modularis. At the time we
were not sure if the pair was sitting but ten days later on the 9th May, two
young fledged. It seems a very short fledging period, unless of course they
were disturbed and left the nest prematurely.
From then onwards whenever anyone was in the garden the parents
seemed to give an alarm call. The young appeared to be fully feathered,
except that neither had a tail. They hopped about in the bushes, perhaps
because they were still unable to fly. The parents did not appear to take any
extra livefood, but we presume that they must have done. At the time, of the
fruit offered, only grapes and sultanas were taken. They also took some of
the insectivorous food, namely Witte Molen Universal paste. They also
liked to run their beaks through seeding grasses. After the first few days
only one youngster remained. The body of the other was never found. The
surviving youngster was a very dull, pale version of its parents and lacked
any of their fulvous coloration. The parents were never aggressive to other
birds but were always noisy.
After the young left the nest, the parents were caught and each fitted
with a split ring, to distinguish them from the youngster, which has never
been caught or handled. At the time of writing (9th December 1997) all
three look alike. We are still unable to distinguish the male and female
parents, but expect to be able to do so when they nest again. Watching them
follow each other is like watching Long-tailed Tits A, caudatus. As autumn
changed to winter, they would not go inside, even after the short, sharp
bursts of cold frosty weather at night followed by heavy rain that we
experienced here in Somerset.
Their outside aviary is 3.6m x 3.6m x 2.25m high (approx, lift 8in x
lift Sin x 7ft 4in high), with the indoor accommodation measuring 1.8m

As described above, the Fulvous-fronted Parrotbill Paradoxornis
fulvifrons, has been bred by M. &amp; N. Curzon. This is probably the first
successful breeding of this species in Great Britain or Ireland. Anyone who
knows of a previous breeding is asked to inform the Hon. Secretary.

In his article Twenty-five Years at Cobham' ( Avicultural Magazine, 103,
2: 49-66), Raymond Sawyer mentioned a number of species which have
been bred there, which are almost certainly first breedings within Great
Britain or Ireland.
They are:-Wattled Ja 9 ana Jacana jacana , Black-winged Stilt Himantopus
himantopus, Black-necked Stilt H. mexicanus , Masked Plover Vanellus miles ,
Violaceous Touraco Musophaga violacea. Black-cheeked Woodpecker
Melanerpes pucherani, Plumbeous Redstart Phoenicurus fuliginosus, Blue
Whistling Thrush Myiophoneus caeruleus, Island Thrush Turdus
poliocephalus. Red-tailed Siva Minla ignotincta , Southern Tit Warbler
Parisoma subcaeruleum, Blue-faced Honeyeater Entomyzon cyanotis, Black-
masked Crimson Tanager Ramphocelus nigrogularis , Black-billed Weaver
Ploceus melanogaster, Emerald Starling Lamprotornis iris, Splendid Glossy
Starling L. splendidus.
Anyone who knows of a previous breeding of any of these species is
asked to inform the Hon. Secretary.

Probably Another First Breeding
During a telephone conversation, just prior to this magazine being printed,
Raymond Sawyer mentioned that at Cobham, one of the pairs of Blue-bellied
Rollers Coracais cyanogaster have three young, which at the time were

the nest. Raymond also said that a pair of Choughs Pyrrhocoraxpyrrhocorax
have reared a youngster.

CHESTER ZOO BIRD REVIEW 1997

Chester Zoo is well known for its parrot collection and emphasis on
working with breeding programmes for vulnerable and endangered birds.
Our most important breeding in 1997 was that of the endangered Red-tailed
Amazon Amazona hrasiliensis. These birds are part of the European EEP
breeding programme co-ordinated from Dresden Zoo by Dr Hubert Liicker.
Chester's pair of Red-tailed Amazons arrived in 1995, the male from Paradise
Park, Cornwall and the female from Loro Parque, Tenerife. This was their
first breeding attempt and we were delighted when two strong chicks fledged
in late July. Unfortunately one died shortly after fledging. The post mortem
indicated a most unusual parasite, Besnoitia as being the cause of death.
This is the first time Red-tailed Amazons have been bred at Chester and to
our knowledge it is also the first breeding of this species on public display
in any zoo.

two Black-cheeked Lovebirds Agapornis nigrigenis. We received the
excellent news that a male Carnaby's White-tailed Black Cockatoo C.
latirostris that we sent on loan to Rotterdam Zoo has successfully sired a
chick.
Mountain Peacock Pheasants Polyplectron inopinatum are another EEP
breeding programme species which were bred for the first time at Chester in
1997, with one chick being foster-reared by a bantam. Other pheasants
raised by foster parents or hand-reared included two Palawan Peacock
Pheasants P. emphanum, two Himalayan Monals Lophophorus impejanus,
two Golden Pheasants Chrysolophus pictus and six Lady Amherst Pheasants
C. amberstiae. Three Satyr Tragopans Tragopan satyra were reared by
their parents. A young male Congo Peafowl Afropavo congensis reared by
its parents was allowed to remain with them whilst they incubated a later
clutch of eggs. Three chicks were hatched which the half-grown male helped
to look after.
A pair of Common Peafowl Pavo cristatus reared five chicks. The Green
Peafowl P. muticus had fertile eggs but none were hatched this year. Two
Roulroul Partridges Rollulus roulroul were parent-reared in their aviary in
the Tropical Realm'. Sixteen Red-legged Partridge Alectoris rufa were
hand-reared from eggs laid by birds in 'Europe on the Edge'. The Red-
legged Partridges hatched chicks in the enclosure but these failed to survive.
Chinese Painted Quail Excalfactoria chinensis successfully reared a chick
in the mixed 'Finch Flight'. The Red-crowned Cranes Grus japonensis
hatched and reared one chick and two West African Crowned Cranes
Balearica pavonina pavonina were foster-reared by bantams. Our Blue or
Stanley Cranes Anthropoides paradisea laid for the first time but the single
egg was infertile. We were devastated when later in the year we lost the
male of this pair and more than grateful to the Tropical Bird Gardens, Rode,
for the loan of their male. The Demoiselle Cranes A. virgo again had infertile
eggs and a new male has been received on loan from Dr Martin Bourne.
Little Egrets Egretta garzetta in 'Europe on the Edge' were unsuccessful in
rearing chicks in 1996 so we elected to take eggs for artificial incubation
and hand-rearing. Two chicks were hand-reared before one of the pairs of
Little Egrets successfully hatched and reared their own chick. Other species
bred in 'Europe on the Edge' included Waldrapp Ibis Geronticus eremita
which reared four chicks (and another three Waldrapp were bred in the 'Big
Flight'). Eight Dalmatian Pelicans Pelecanus crispus were received from
Villars Les Dombes, France, to increase our flock to ten.
We were asked to assist with collecting Lapwing Vanellus vanellus eggs
from Hawarden Airport where there was a particular problem with these
nesting waders presenting a hazard to the planes using this airport. A number

of clutches of set eggs were rescued and returned to our Incubation and
Rearing Unit. Most of these were hatched and reared and although we had
some difficulties in establishing these in the vast 'Europe on the Edge' habitat,
at the year end we held a total of nine Lapwings. This total included an
additional two rescue birds which were received from Gronant Bird Help
together with a Golden Plover Pluvialis apricaria.
The European Black Vultures Aegypius monachus again spent weeks
extending to months sitting on their nest but again no eggs were laid. A pair
of European Griffon Vultures Gypsfulvus were received on loan from Bristol
Zoo during the winter and have already settled well in 'Europe on the Edge 5 .
Perhaps their arrival may stimulate the European Black Vultures into
reproductive activity this year. Other new arrivals included an Egyptian
Vulture Neophron percnopterus , which has been housed together with the
Secretary Birds Sagittarius serpentarius and four Turkey Vultures Cathartes
aura, one American Black Vulture Coragyps atratus and a Crested Caracara
Polyborus plancus in the new 'Condor Cliffs' exhibit.
Caribbean Flamingos Phoenicopterus ruber ruber and Chilean Flamingos
P chilensis were both very late starting to nest. A dry spring which did not
encourage nesting behaviour was followed by a June so wet that when eggs
were laid, they sat in small pools of water in the nest depressions. This
necessitated our removal of some eggs for artificial incubation which we
replaced with dummy eggs and then returning them prior to hatching.
Although two Caribbean chicks were hatched, neither survived and of four
Chilean Flamingos hatched only one survived, giving us our poorest year
with flamingos since 1990.
Our successes breeding Humboldt's Penguins Spheniscus humboldti over
the last few years has resulted in them being so well represented in other
European zoos that we agreed not to hand-rear any chicks in 1997. All
chicks were left with their parents, resulting in three parent-reared youngsters.
Six penguins were collected from Chester by Amneville Zoo in France and
three birds, representing new bloodlines were received from Emmen Zoo,
Netherlands.
Waterfowl reared in 1997 included Hawaiian Geese Branta sandvicensis ,

Although we had some foot growth problems with newly fledged Luzon

nicobarica each fledged a chick but this was soured by the loss of two of the

reared 15 youngsters over the last five years and are thought to now be more
than adequately represented in the managed British zoo population. We
followed the studbook co-ordinators request to split this pair, resulting in no
breeding in 1997. A new female was introduced to the breeding male but
they showed little interest in each other. Two Tawny Frogmouths Podargus
strigoides were hand-reared and. two Kookaburras Dacelo novaeguineae
were reared by their parents.

We had a less successful year with hornbills. The Great Indian Hornbills
Buceros bicornis rnlidded-up but the female emerged without evidence of
egg laying. Wrinkled Hornbills Aceros corrugatus and Trumpeter Hornbills
Bycanistes bucinator both hatched chicks but these failed to fledge
successfully and only one African Grey Hornbill Tockus nasutus epirhinus
was reared. The touracos were more successful with three Schalow's
Touracos Tauraco schaloxvi and one Violaceous Touraco Musophaga
violacea reared. The White -cheeked Touracos T. leucotis were late breeding
and although chicks hatched none were fledged. Four Red-billed Magpies
Urocissa erythrorhyncha were reared by their parents but this year neither
pair of Superb Spreo Starlings Spreo superbus were successful in raising
young. All four of our Superb Spreos have been in the collection between
13 and 14 years and were adult when received. Our longest living passerine
in the zoo is a Red-billed Quelea Quelea quelea received as an adult in
1978, which must now be at least 20 years old.
In the 'Tropical Realm' the Emerald Starlings Lamprocolius iris fledged
two chicks but these disappeared before the year end; possibly having
escaped, for no bodies were discovered. Red-eared Bulbuls Pycnonotus
jocosus, Pekin Robins Leiothrix lutea and Silver-beaked Tanagers
Ramphocelus carbo also fledged chicks. One pair of White-rumped Shamas
Copsychus malabaricus fledged several broods of chicks and a Plumbeous
Redstart Rhyacornis fuliginosa was hand-reared. Mexican House Finches
Carpodacus mexicanus. Zebra Finches Poephila guttata and Red-cheeked
Cordon-bleus Uraeginthus bengalus reared chicks in the Finch Flight. We
were especially pleased with the latter, as these commonly imported waxbills
are so often neglected in zoo collections. New species received included
Omei Shan Liocichlas Liocichla omeiensis, Red-legged Honeycreepers
Cyanerpes cyaneus and Grosbeak Starlings Scissirostrum dubium all of
which have been highlighted for co-operative management in European zoos.
In total 87 species hatched chicks in the collection from which a total of
262 chicks from 72 species were reared successfully. The highlights were
Chester Zoo's first successes with Red-tailed Amazons, Illiger's Macaws
and Mountain Peacock Pheasants and the repeated breeding of several other
conservationally sensitive species including West African Crowned Cranes.
It was generally a good year for breeding but as always we also had our
disappointments. With birds, no one year is like another, and we look forward
to this breeding season knowing that there will be challenges and
disappointments but hoping that at the end of the year there may also be
further successes to report.

Two races of the Star Finch are recognised, namely Neochima r. ruficauda
which is the nominate form and found south of Rockhampton in Queensland
and N.r. clarescens which is found across northern Australia. The former
has less crimson around the facial area and the abdomen is creamy-white. It
is reported as being very rare in the wild. Indeed, from recent reports, it
appears that both races are becoming somewhat scarce in the wild. N. r.
clarescens is more brightly coloured, with extensive crimson on the facial
area and a more yellow abdomen. Although there are two recognised races,
other than in their country of origin, they have become so interbred that it is
virtually impossible to identify the two distinct races in captive bred birds.
Star Finches can prove ideal subjects for the newcomer to Australian
finches as well as to the more experienced enthusiast. The species is easily
sexed, but the birds need to be nine months old or more before one can be
certain of the sex of each individual. Young males can often be sexed at an
early age as the majority usually start to sing shortly after being weaned.
However, one cannot always be sure that non-singing birds are in fact
females, until full adult plumage is attained. In full adult plumage male Star
Finches have the entire front of the head, ear-coverts and throat crimson.
Adult females have less crimson on the facial area. Also the white spotting
which appears on the ear-coverts, mesia and throat is not so prominent in
the female as it is in the male.
Star Finches will breed readily in either cage or aviary. They will also
mix well with other species which are approximately the same size. Few
pairs attempt to build a nest from scratch. Because of this, it is best to partly
fill nest-boxes with soft hay before placing them in position. A small amount
of nesting material should also be placed within easy reach of the breeding
pair and the supply should be maintained at least until the chicks have
hatched. The reason for this is that many males (especially when the breeding
pair is housed in a cage) will continually take material from the nest while
the female is incubating. In some cases, so depleting the nest, the female
deserts. I put this behaviour down to boredom. If extra nesting material is
made available to the male, he can occupy himself with this rather than
robbing the nest.
The average clutch is five to six eggs. Incubation usually begins after
the fourth egg is laid. Although both birds take turns in incubating, it is the
female which incubates during the night period and for lengthy periods
throughout the day. It can take from between 12 to 15 days for the eggs to
hatch, according to how well the birds sit. Star Finches are extremely light

sitters and even the most steady pairs will leave the nest at the least
provocation. Because of this, nest inspection is easily carried out. However,
as Star Finches are less tolerant of nest inspection than most other species of
Australian finch, I would suggest the eggs be inspected for fertility only
once, the best time being some seven to eight days after incubation
commenced. The nest should not be inspected again until the chicks are
approximately ten days old. At this age, well fed chicks should be ready to
be fitted with size C closed-rings. Once the rings have been fitted, the nest
should not be inspected again until the young have fledged.

Star Finch chicks 12 days old
Star Finch chicks usually fledge when they are approximately 20 days
old. It is important not to accidentally disturb them just before fledging, as
if they leave the nest prematurely, one may find it impossible to persuade
them to return, even to roost.
Immature birds have the upperparts dull olive-brown with the underparts
brownish-buff, fading to white on the lower breast and turning to pure white
on the abdomen and under tail-coverts. Their beaks are black; legs and feet
brown. Young Star Finches begin to moult into a subadult plumage when
they are approximately eight weeks old. When this moult is completed, the
birds will look very much like poorly coloured adults. The males will have
a certain amount of crimson on the facial area, but not nearly so much as a
fully adult bird. Females in subadult plumage, may have a certain amount
of crimson on the forehead, but their overall colour will be much paler than
that of the males. The beaks of both sexes will have turned from black to
red and the legs and feet will have become yellow. It may be six or seven

months before the young birds again begin to moult. When this moult is
completed, the birds will be in full adult plumage and therefore easy to sex
visually.
As a basic diet Star Finches can be offered either a good quality foreign
finch mixture, or one can do as I do and supply plain canary seed, white
millet and panicum millet in separate dishes. Spray millet can be supplied
ad-lib. Small oyster shell, limestone and mineralised grit should be available
at all times, as should cuttlefish bone. Every two or three days, flaked
cuttlefish bone should also be offered, especially to laying females.
An -added source of calcium much enjoyed by Star Finches is shells
from chicken eggs. Clean shells should first be placed in a saucepan of hot
water which is allowed to simmer for two or three minutes, after which the
shells can be removed and allowed to dry out completely. They can then be
stored in a screw top jar ready for use.
Before offering the shells to your birds, first place about a quarter of a
shell in the palm of your hand and then crash it into small pieces with your
thumb. The pieces can then be offered to your birds by placing them on top
of the grit. I give Star Finches of all ages about a quarter of a whole shell
about every three or four days. Laying females can be offered the shells
more frequently. Any uneaten shell should be removed after 24 hours,
otherwise it may become soiled with droppings.
As with the majority of Australian finches, Star Finches enjoy greenfood
and such items as thoroughly washed lettuce and spinach should be offered
on a regular basis. Greenfood taken directly from the wild must be thoroughly
washed under clean running water before giving it to your birds and care
should be taken that it is gathered from an area which has not been fouled
by cats or dogs or sprayed with chemicals. If in doubt, then do as I do and
supply only commercially grown lettuce. Even the latter must be thoroughly
washed before use.
Clean water for drinking must, of course, be available at all times.
Star Finches, especially when rearing young, can often be persuaded to
take a good proprietary brand of egg food. Sprouted seeds are usually relished
and should be offered ad-lib to pairs with chicks. Both&apos;these foods must be
fed fresh each day, any remaining after 24 hours being discarded.

Although reports have appeared of a fawn mutation of the Star Finch, as

mutation is well established both in Europe and the USA. The pied mutation
is also well established in Europe, but as far as I know, is very scarce (maybe
even unobtainable) in the USA. Both mutations are recessive; i.e. if either

Immature Star Finch, male, pied mutation. The crown and white bill
will become red when the bird becomes fully adult (see text)
Pieds are also mated together regularly. However, the latter mutation
requires outcrossing from time to time to pure normals of good size.
Otherwise their size and stamina quickly deteriorate. When first it appeared
in the UK, the pied Star Finch was extremely popular. In the majority of
cases only the extremities are pied (i.e. the flight and tail feathers and also
part of the head) and no doubt due to this the mutation quickly lost favour
and at present few breeders appear to be persevering with pied Star Finches.
Another feature of this mutation which can prove disappointing (especially
if a breeder is not aware of the fact), is that many young birds which appear
heavily pied whilst in immature plumage, will, if the pied area is around the
face and on the beak have the pied areas replaced with the 'normal 5 colour,
i.e. bright crimson, when the bird moults into full adult plumage. I have
seen the occasional bird with pied areas of plumage on the body as well as
the extremities, but such birds appear to be the exception rather than the
rale. The combination of yellow and pied has recently appeared, although
as yet I have seen.only colour photographs of this mutation.

THE SUCCESSFUL PARENT REARING OF A PESQUET'S
PARROT Psittrichas fulgidus AT LORO PARQUE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.976124552631579" page_id="56285800"  page_num="14" year="" vol="">
by Roger G. Sweeney
Pesquet's Parrot Psittrichas fulgidus remains an uncommon species in
zoological collections with records of captive breeding being comparatively
scarce. Successful breedings have during the past 20 years been recorded in
a number of collections including Loro Parque, Palmitos Park, Bronx Zoo,
Los Angeles Zoo, Jurong Bird Park and that of Antonio de Dios in the
Philippines. Despite these successes the captive status of Pesquet's Parrot
is still fragile and breeding can not be described as consistent in any of the
collections which have reared this species. The majority of birds which
have so far been raised have been hand-reared. The reason why more
breeding pairs have not been given the opportunity to rear their own young
is unclear. Los Angeles Zoo has recorded some success with parent rearing.
Pesquet's Parrots have been kept in the collection at Loro Parque for
many years and successful breeding has taken place in the past. The male
of the pair which is currently on exhibition was reared at Loro Parque. In
recent years, however only clutches of infertile eggs had been laid. Two
pairs with the potential to breed are currently housed in the collection, each
of which laid two clutches of infertile eggs during the early and middle part
of the 1997 breeding season. In November both pairs laid a third clutch,
and the eggs of one pair proved to be fertile and resulted in the hatching of
a chick in early December. When first seen the chick appeared strong and
had food in the crop and therefore was left with its parents. Intervention
with the view to artificial rearing was considered unnecessary so long as the
chick was observed to be developing well in the care of its parents.
The pair of Pesquet's Parrots which hatched the chick are housed in the
new off-exhibit breeding centre. Both parents were bred in captivity and
were hand-reared and so it was particularly pleasing to see them rear their
offspring successfully. The male was reared at Jurong Bird Park and the
female was reared at Bronx Zoo. They were introduced to each in 1996, in
one of the older breeding centres, and at the beginning of 1997 were relocated
to the new breeding centre where they are currently housed in an aviary
which measures 12m long x 1.5m wide x 2.5m high (approx. 39ft long x 5ft
wide x 8ft high). A nesting log was prepared from a segment of the trunk of
a Washington Palm, and placed towards the rear of the aviary. We partly
hollowed out the nesting cavity, but left the main part of the excavation to
the birds. The aviary is furnished with three main horizontal perches which
extend across the width of the aviary at the front, middle and rear of its
length. Smaller perches are positioned in front of the entrance to the nest

and at the front of the flight. The birds are fed twice-daily on a special
liquidised diet, the ingredients of which include apple, pear, papaya, banana
and carrot. In addition segments of fresh fruit are attached to the perches
and a feeding dish of Prettybird Lory Select pelleted diet is provided. Clean
drinking water is available at all times and once a day the birds are given a
ten minute shower from an overhead sprinkler system.
The pair in the breeding centre began their first clutch of 1997 on 1st
July, when two eggs were laid. These were removed later when they were
overdue and were considered to be infertile. A second clutch was laid on
the 10th September. On this occasion the first egg was laid in the nest and
the second was found on the front feeding tray and was taken for artificial
incubation. The egg in the nest was removed when it became overdue, and
like the previous eggs was considered infertile. However, the egg which
was artificially incubated was suspected of having been fertile and that the
embryo had died early in its development.
This led us to suspect that some of the eggs previously thought to have
been infertile might in fact have been fertile and had suffered a similar fate
due to poor incubation behaviour by the pair. When they began nesting
again, this time in November, we left them undisturbed for the first ten
days, until the 19th November, when the nest was inspected and a clutch of
three eggs was seen. They were left undisturbed until we expected them to
hatch and on the 8th December we checked the nest and found a chick which
appeared to be two or three days old. The remaining two eggs did not hatch.
The chick appeared in good condition and had food in the crop, therefore it
was not disturbed. On the 28th December, I briefly removed the chick from
the nest so that one of the staff veterinarians could check the bone
development, which appeared perfect. We decided against the use of a closed
leg band as Pesquet's Parrots have proved susceptible to leg problems,
particularly Hyperkeratosis which can be problematic with metal leg bands.
Instead the local CITES officials were informed about the chick soon after
it hatched and were invited to observe the chick and its development. The
preferred method of identification marking for this species is to place a
micro-chip in the breast muscle once the chick is fledged.
From the third week of February onwards the chick could be seen each
day looking out from the entrance of the nest, but it did not fledge until 14th
March, when it left the nest in the morning and joined its parents perching
in the aviary. From the first day out of the nest the chick looked strong and
confident and seemed comfortable in flight and when landing. Within a few
days it was seen feeding by itself and by April was regularly taking food
directly from the food dish. On the 2nd April the chick was captured for a
veterinary examination and so that a micro-chip could be placed in its breast
muscle in the presence of the local CITES officials. The-chick had good

body condition and is now independent and looks strong. This success is
especially pleasing because Pesquet's Parrot is very much in need of more
consistent breeding in captivity, and also because the chick was reared by
its parents. This point is even more significant when one remembers that
both parents are captive bred and hand-reared. This new breeding pair are
comparatively young and so it is to be hoped that Loro Parque can look
forward to many more successful years ahead with this pair, now that they
have registered their first success.

The 1996/97 breeding season was the most productive in recent years.
A total of 33 chicks hatched and 23 survived to fledging: 20 in captivity and
three in the wild. In May 1997 the total population was estimated at 76-87
birds: 50-61 birds in the wild and 26 birds in captivity. This represents
about a 50% increase since last year.
The wild population includes 14-19 females, 33-39 males (a ratio of
about 1:2) and three fledglings. Of these, six or seven are believed to be
sub-adults and one year old birds, including five or six males and one female.
A survey of the Black River Gorges National Park in August and
September 1996 discovered six new breeding groups bringing the total to
13 known wild breeding groups of which 12 bred. The main focus of the
work included intensive nest site management, rescuing eggs and chicks
from failing nests, clutch and brood manipulations and predator control.
Thirty-four eggs were laid in the wild of which 14 were harvested and two
died as embryos. Eighteen chicks hatched in the wild of which 11 were
rescued, four died in the wild and three fledged.
In May 1997, the captive population comprised 13 males, 12 females
and one juvenile of unknown sex.. There were two adult males and four
adult females and one established breeding pair. Eleven wild pairs are likely
to be genetically represented in the captive population. Twenty-six chicks
were handled at the breeding centre, 20 of which fledged. Captive

management focused on hand-rearing and 20 chicks were hand-reared or
partly hand-reared, 16 of which fledged. The remaining chicks were reared
by Ring-neck Parrakeets P. krameri foster parents. Disease affected most
of the chicks and caused some mortalities in chicks and at post-fledging.
A release into the wild of captive bred Ring-neck Parrakeets has been
carried out to develop release techniques suitable for Echo Parrakeets. A
release of captive bred Echo Parrakeets into native forest is intended within
the next year, following the lUCN's Reintroduction Specialist Group
guidelines.
In recent years there has been a considerable increase in the known wild
population of Echo Parrakeets. Some of this is undoubtedly due to a real
increase in the number of birds but is also a result of additional birds being
found due to more intensive fieldwork.
It is recommended that future work focuses on improving the productivity
and survival of the Echo Parrakeet by improvements in nest site management,
supplemental feeding of wild birds, disease control and improved diet for
the captive birds.
This will require a greater investment in the project.
The Executive Survey reproduced above, preceded the Echo Parrakeet
Management Report for 1997, presented at the 1998 International
Aviculturists Society Convention, which can be read in full in that Society's

they released 11 captive reared Echo Parrakeets, of which at the time of
writing (10th May 1998), ten were still alive. They joined three released in
June 1997. The conservation of the Echo Parrakeet is one of a number of
projects managed by the Mauritius Wildlife Foundation.

The origins of Abbotsbury Swannery are lost in the mists of time. The
first known mention of it is in 1393, on a long roll of sheep or goat skins
sewn into strips with sheep sinews. The strips formed the Monks' Court
Rolls and were the record of wrongs adjudicated upon by the Abbot of the
monastery to which the swannery belonged. The entry in question refers to
the seven pence fine, which must have been quite a sum in those days,
imposed on William Squillor, the monastery swan herd, for lowering hatches
or sluice boards and raising the level of the Fleet, thereby flooding the swans'
nest site at nesting time, something which occasionally still happens
accidentally. Although there is no written proof of the existence of the
swannery prior to 1393, it seems certain that a colony of Mute Swans Cygnus
olor had been nesting in the Fleet long before this date. It is probable that
the swans were already there when the monastery was founded in the 11 th
century, and that the monks merely took advantage of their presence, and
potentiality, as a source of food and income. They also bred pigeons in the
pigeon house which, still stands near the Tithe Barn.
As well as providing the medieval monks with fresh meat, the swans'
wing quills were used to make quill pens and their down was used to stuff
pillows. At one time the Fleet was known as &apos;Anglice a Meare', from the
Frence word Anglicing , meaning pinioning or the removal of part of the
wing. Presumably, this was done so that the swans could be penned and
fattened for the table. Even nowadays, Lloyds of London use quills from
Abbotsbury swans to enter shipping and other insurance losses in its Doom
Book , and the white headpieces on the helmets of the Queen's bodyguard,
the Gentleman at Arms, are made from the soft feathers from under the
swan's wings. Several hundred feathers are needed for each helmet and
enough are supplied to complete one a year.
All Mute Swans living on open water in England today legally belong to
the Queen. The only exceptions are the Abbotsbury swans and those on the
River Thames belonging to the Worshipful Company of Vintners and Dyers.
The Abbey of St Peter's ownership of the Abbotsbury swans ended in 1539,
following Henry VHi's dissolution of the monasteries, at which time both
the village of Abbotsbury and the estate were acquired by the Strangeways
family. Fifteen generations later they are still owned by the same family
and to show the family's ownership, the swans are nicked with a sharp knife
on the outside of the web of one foot. This mark is called the &apos;Hive of
Ilchester', from an old word for indentation, and possibly refers to a series
of small inlets&apos; along the back of the Fleet - Hodden Hive, Langton Hive,

Chickerel Hive. As well as being marked, the swans are fitted with numbered
white rings. Ringing has revealed that 15 years is a good age for an
Abbotsbury swan. At the time of the swannery's 600th anniversary in 1993,
the oldest swan was a 16 year old female. The record stands at 25 years.
Abbotsbury Swannery is roughly midway between Bridport and
Weymouth, Dorset, on the south coast of England. The Fleet is a brackish
lagoon, eight miles (almost 13km) long, sheltered from the English Channel
by the Chesil Bank, a geologically unique shingle bank some 17 miles
(approx. 27km) long. The Fleet is vital to the continued existence of the
swannery - without it there would be no colony. The shallow water of the
Fleet is rich in Eel Grass Zostera marina , which makes up a large part of the
81bs (approx. 3.6g) or so of plant matter which each swan consumes daily.
One of the main reasons that the swans nest close together at Abbotsbury
(the present nesting area covers only about five acres (approx, two hectares))
is to do with their management and feeding. Feeding helps reduce the need
for larger territories normally needed to find sufficient food to feed the
growing cygnets. Management of the swans really begins in earnest at nesting
time. The position of each nest is recorded on a map, as is the ring number
of each bird, the date each egg is laid and the date it hatches. Normally the
swannery is lucky to have any eggs before the beginning of March, but this
year, perhaps as a result of the mild winter and spring, the first egg was laid
on the 13th March and the first cygnets hatched 30th April, a fortnight earlier
than usual. Mute Swans usually lay one egg every two days (on average).
The average clutch size at Abbotsbury is five. This year there were one or
two nests with ten eggs and another with 12, but in the case of the latter, it is
felt certain that four of these were laid by a 'cuckold swan'. Incubation
begins when the clutch is complete and usually takes 35 days from when the
last egg is laid. All the eggs hatch within about 24 hours.
When the cygnets are two days old, and dry and fluffy, but before their
parents first lead them to the water, each is given a small web tag which is
numbered. This can prove very helpful, as cygnets easily become confused
and get lost in such a big colony. The swanherd then has to decide whether
to return them to their parents or foster them. This may depend on a number
of things - the distance from the nest to the water, how good the parents are
at looking after their young, and how many other swan territories the family
has to walk through on its daily journeys to and from the water. To make
their journeys easier, staff sometimes accompany them. A way of helping
pairs which in recent years have begun nesting farther from the Fleet is to
feed them in temporary troughs, which also saves the families having to
cross other pairs' territories. They are fed in this way three times a day,
which can mean that food and water has to be carried to over 100 nests.
In spite of the care the birds receive, only 100 or so cygnets survive each

year from six times this number of eggs. The least successful swans are
newly paired birds and young birds nesting for the first time. To relieve the
pressure on the territories, some of the earliest families to hatch are put in
pens. These are usually the most dominant and well established. By
removing them, space is created round their vacated nesting areas, providing
new territories for pairs nesting later. Birds usually accept being moved,
and at the same time can be given extra cygnets to foster. Parents with less
than three cygnets are never chosen, as it is thought that the adults can count
up to three and would be unlikely to take on extra young. During the 1997
breeding season 106 pairs nested and out of the 565 eggs laid, 427 hatched,
with a 39% survival rate among the cygnets, which is considered very good.
There is always a high proportion of swans on the Fleet which do not nest in
any one year. This may be because of a number of reasons, e.g. they may be
too young, or may not have a partner. In any one season usually only about
one-third of the population is involved in nesting.
The national population has increased by 42% since the last census in
the 1980s. Recent mild winters have helped the swans' survival rate. On
the other hand, hard winters can decimate their numbers. Many hundreds
of swans died on the Fleet during the severe winter of 1962-1963, and well
over 100 died during the winter of 1986. During February in particular,
food can become scarce. Over 1,000 swans regularly winter on the Fleet.
Last year's annual count recorded 1,381 wintering there, including many
visiting birds from the Somerset Levels and other neighbouring localities,
attracted by the Fleet's rich source of natural food. They are joined by up to
20,000 other waterfowl, including nearly 9,000 Wigeon Anas penelope,
mostly from Russia, and 2,500 Brent Geese Branta bernida from Siberia.
In the early spring, in order to reduce the pressure on the plant food, wheat
is fed to them in the water about one mile (approx. 1.6km) from the swannery.
Every two years the Abbotsbury swans are rounded up. This takes place
in July, when most of the birds are moulting and unable to fly. The annual
moult takes six weeks and among the first feathers to be shed are the flight
feathers. Rounding up so many birds is obviously a mammoth task and for
it the swannery staff are joined by some 60 helpers from the Wildfowl and
Wetlands Trust, Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology, Oxford, and
other field workers, who use boats and canoes to shepherd the swans ashore
where they are penned. Although the aim is to round up the entire population,
invariably some have completed their moult and manage to get airborne
and escape, and the final total penned is usually some 650 to 800 swans.
Broken and missing rings are replaced (usually 100 or so swans are found to
have no ring). The rings ensure that individuals can be identified in the
interests of better management and the understanding of population
dynamics. It is the main reason for rounding-up the swans, but the

opportunity is also taken to check each bird for wounds and feather lice, and
to take a blood sample. They are also weighed. One bred at Abbotsbury
about 15 years ago, had a wingspan of 7ft lOin (approx. 2.4m) and weighed
421bs (19.050kg), a good 121bs (5.443kg) more than most other big cobs.

Duck Decoy
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983769727272727" page_id="56285807"  page_num="21" year="" vol="">
In 1655 the new owner of Abbotsbury, Sir John Strangeways and his son
Giles, leased land on the edge of the Fleet to a John Hearne, for the
construction of a duck decoy and a 'little house adjoyneigne'. This same
decoy is one of only five still in use in Britain. Not only is it the oldest
working example, but is also the one truest to its original design. Only two
tunnels (or 'pipes') now run from the square decoy pond near the swans'
nesting site, though a third nearby leads directly to the Fleet lagoon. The
mesh covering each tunnel is supported by locally cut ash or willow hoops
and the entire 'pipe' is about 50m (approx. 164ft) long. As well as tapering,
it is curved slightly so that the ducks entering it cannot see the fate of their
companions at the other end. Tame ducks act as decoys, and grain is used to
help entice the birds along the tunnel. Once inside, the ducks are driven
towards the tail by the decoyman, who appears from behind one of a number
of reed screens placed at an angle along the outside of the tunnel. It may
sound simple, but a lot depends on the skill of the decoyman.
The earliest surviving records of the Abbotsbury decoy date back to
1662 and list 112 ducks being supplied to the kitchens at Melbury, and the
sale of a further 966. Traditionally, the annual haul averaged about 500-600
ducks, though in the 1920s 2,564 were taken in three seasons. Most were
eaten locally, with any surpluses going to market in London. Wildfowl
caught in the Abbotsbury decoy nowadays are ringed and released in the
hope of learning more about their migratory movements. Ringing started at
Abbotsbury in 1937 with Teal A. crecca and Mallard A. platyrhynchos. Other
wildfowl ringed there since include Gadwall A. strep era. Pintail A. acuta,
Shoveler A. clypeata, Wigeon, Pochard Aythya ferina and a Cinnamon Teal
Anas cyanopteral Wildfowl ringed at Abbotsbury have been found in 14
different countries, inevitably most have been shot, although the ring from a
Tufted Duck Aythya fuligula was recovered from the eyrie of a pair of White-
tailed Eagles Haliceetus albicilla in Finland.

Reed and Withy Beds
Situated mainly around the swannery, they provide shelter for the nesting
swans and important habitat for a range of plants, birds and other animals.
Because so many reed beds have disappeared or are under threat, those at
Abbotsbury are, whenever possible, managed in such a way as to encourage
wildlife. Reed Warblers Acrocephalus scirpaceus , Sedge Warblers A.
schoenobaenus, Reed Buntings Emberiza schoeniclus and Bearded Tits or
Reedlings Panurus biamicus are among the birds which benefit from this
policy. In the autumn flocks of Swallows Hirundo rustica , Sand Martins
Riparia riparia and Yellow Wagtails Motacilla flava feed and rest there
before flying south to spend the winter in Africa.
The village of Abbotsbury still has many picturesque thatched roofs,
thatched with reed from Abbotsbury's own reed beds, as they have been
since time immemorial. Several hundred bundles are also set aside to be
used as nesting material by the swans and it is also used to renew the screens
lining the tunnels of the duck decoy. As well as being used to make hoops
to support the mesh covering the tunnels of the decoy, the willow is still
used to produce spars, the wooden staples, for fixing the thatch to the roofs
of the houses in the village.

Without a stimulating environment captive parrots, in order to relieve
their boredom, often resort to self-mutilation (most commonly feather
plucking), over-eating or other behavioural problems such as stereotypic
movements. Cage size presents a major problem for pet parrots, which, if
kept for long periods in cages which are too small can show severe
behavioural problems. As a general rale parrots should be able to spread
both their wings and turn in a cage without them touching the sides, although
this can be unrealistic with some of the larger macaws (Csaky, 1995).
Boredom is another common problem with pet parrots which can lead to
behavioural problems. The suggestions made in the following sections
concern all caged parrots and can be related to both pets and zoo specimens.
Feather plucking is a common problem, often seen in companion birds
and zoo specimens. To some degree different species of parrots may have
diverse causative factors that influence feather problems and certainly the
age that feather plucking starts has a great deal to do with the reasons
(Blanchard, 1996). There are many psychological and physical factors which
are involved in feather plucking, a common reason given being sexual
frustration. While this can be a cause in adult birds it is certainly not the
only problem especially in immature specimens.
Disease, injury, malnutrition, allergies and/or a sub-standard environment
are physical factors which all lead to excessive feather problems. Feather
plucking, whether due to physical or psychological problems can cause
noticeable bald patches and is seen especially in areas the bird can easily
reach. Typical feather plucking sites include the wing skin fold (wing web),
inner thighs and breast (Rosenthal, 1993). Two major physical causes of
plucking can be an inadequate diet lacking in calcium and vitamin A, and a
low environmental humidity and/or insufficient bathing. Both calcium and
vitamin A are essential nutrients for growth and maintaining condition in
skin, feathers and tissues, and moisture (either in the air or applied directly
to the skin) is needed to prevent skin dehydration which can cause flaking,
itching and subsequent feather plucking. Disease and injury also can cause
feather picking but with correct husbandry these rarely occur.
Psychological or behavioural problems often result in feather plucking.
This is often seen in hand-reared birds (Blanchard, 1996) where there has
been no guidance by an adult of the same species, resulting in the learning
of the wrong preening techniques, similarly wrong techniques can be learned
by very young birds if housed with or near birds of a different species, whose
preening techniques may be copied. As there are distinct differences in
feather morphology between species this can often cause problems.

Copying is common in young birds and includes copying the habits of
others, a bird may start feather plucking simply by watching another bird
pluck and proceeding to do the same. Insecure, poorly socialised birds,
those with phobic tendencies or birds subjected to sudden change (such as
change of environment) often show stress related feather plucking which
can become habitual if the bird receives more attention than usual when it
plucks. Poor early socialisation can cause confusion when the bird is placed
in a social environment (a shared cage, a public display etc.). This can
result in serious behaviour dysfunctions and is normally seen in birds under
two years old when it manifests as feather plucking (Blanchard, 1996).
When behaviours are frustrated, increased aggression often results. This
is usually directed at pen mates but it may be self directed (Bareham, 1973).
This can take the form of feather plucking which in this instance may be
attributed to a lack of stimulation in the environment. This may be rectified
by providing more space, a companion, more 'toys' or time out of the caged
environment. Environmental enrichment has long been recognised as a
method of reducing or alleviating behavioural problems including feather
picking (King, 1992). This will be considered later on.
Another behavioural problem witnessed in captive animals are stereotypic
movements. Stereotypies tend to arise when the normal behavioural
expression of a motivational state is restricted or blocked (Lawrence &amp;
Rushden, 1993). When these behaviours occur in a captive environment,
both the behavioural and spatial needs of the animal must be examined.
There are two basic forms of stereotypic movements found in a zoo
environment (Stookey &amp; Watts, 1998). One of these, pacing, is said to
occur when the animal moves repeatedly back and forth in a straight line, a
circle, or a figure of eight pattern. In captive parrots this may take the form
of pacing along a perch, or climbing up and down or along the aviary wire.
While stationary acts, which can constitute stationary stereotypies, are
repeated non locomotive acts, such as rocking, head tossing or weaving,
swaying movements and repetitive head bobbing, often seen in captive
parrots.
Boredom and inactivity due to lack of stimuli can be seen as two of the
main causes of stereotypic behaviours. It may also be that these movements
develop as escape attempts which are incompletely carried out due to a lack
of space in the caged environment (Bareham, 1973, Stookey et ah, 1998)
and also that they may increase with outside stimulation. The arrival of
visitors, or the keeper at feeding time, or sudden noise all cause an increase
in behaviour (Bareham, 1973)
When it is presumed that stereotypic behaviours have occurred due to
lack of stimuli then the environment in which the animal is kept should be
examined. If the environment is found to be lacking in content and does not
arouse any species typical behaviours then environmental enrichment

techniques should be considered.
When the limits of the cage simply mean a distinct demarcation of
territory for the animal, ideal conditions for captivity have been achieved
(Hediger, 1964). This, however, is not often seen with captive parrots. To
enrich the environment of a caged animal it should be made as naturalistic
as possible so that it resembles the habitat the animal occupies in the wild.
This can be done with relative ease by, for example, adding extra vegetation.
For captive animals vegetable matter may have many other kinds of
significance (Hediger, 1964) for example; food, support (an opportunity for
climbing, home, living space, sleeping and nesting space), means of
sharpening and abrasion for beaks and claws, building materials for nesting,
cover or camouflage. In all these different ways vegetation can enrich a
caged environment and stimulate the creatures living in it. Other forms of
enrichment, such as placing Toys' in the cage can also bring about a decrease
in stereotypic behaviour.
Enrichment experiments on Crimson-breasted Conures Pyrrhura perlata
perlata (Van Hoek &amp; King, 1977) using rope, branches, wooden baskets,
egg boxes and hidden fruit to enrich the environment, all produced positive
effects. Observed effects were increased locomotion and a decrease in
preening behaviour which, in environments lacking stimuli can become
habitualised in the form of feather plucking. A further study using food
based enrichment techniques (Coulton, Waran &amp; Young, 1997) which
encourage foraging behaviour showed that providing extra foraging
opportunities for parrots is a useful form of enrichment. During enrichment
periods the birds spent significantly more time allopreening than in the
baseline or post enrichment periods. As the majority of parrots forage for
food in the wild this gave the birds a chance to exhibit a species typical
behaviour. Providing several different enrichments allows animals to perform
a greater range of behaviours, become more active in captivity and decrease
the likelihood of habituation to certain enrichment items. The goals of
enrichment are varied (Powell, 1995) and include: increasing activity levels,
providing opportunities for species typical behaviours, decreasing or
eliminating stereotypic or self destructive behaviours, improving captive
breeding and rearing of offspring, and educating the public.
Abnormal behaviours exhibited in captivity (those which would not
normally be seen in the wild) can be lessened or corrected by providing
more adequate environmental conditions, proper care and correct nutrition.
It has been proven that with the appropriate care and environmental
conditions, stereotypies, feather plucking and other detrimental behaviour
can be lessened or eliminated and that these conditions are necessary for
maintaining healthy and content cage birds.
A good marker for suitable captive conditions is an animal's reproductive
state, if it is reproducing successfully it can be said that the correct

<bodyText confidence="0.999706266666667" page_id="56285812"  page_num="26" year="" vol="">
environmental conditions have been achieved. Indirect and anecdotal
evidence indicates the importance of physical and temporal complexity for
reproduction (Carlstead et al., 1994). Chronic stress may compromise
reproductive physiology and behaviour, enrichment reduces stress by
providing increased opportunity for behavioural coping responses.
Environmental enrichment may also influence reproductive success by
stabilising social groups, reducing aggression and increasing affiliative and
play behaviours.
To conclude it can be said that by enriching the environment of captive
animals, their welfare can be improved. The enrichments may be food or
play based, both decrease the occurrence of stereotypic behaviours and, in
captive parrots, incidences of feather plucking. The more diverse an
environment an animal is provided with, the more relaxed and content that
animal becomes to the point where it reproduces successfully, a positive
indicator that ideal or near ideal conditions for captivity have been achieved.

The importance of avian body mass (weight) is well understood. In this
paper, the masses (weights) of 328 individuals from 112 species of captive
parrots are recorded, along with their sex and condition.
The birds all come from Danish captive collections. The masses were
obtained using a balance weight, and the sex was determined by internal
inspection. Age determination was made by studying the size of gonads,
the form of the oviduct, and the presence or absence of bursa Fabricii, all
methods described by Erritzoe (1985). Taxonomy follows Forshaw and

A GUIDE TO GRASS PARROTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99580315625" page_id="56285820"  page_num="34" year="" vol="">
Toby Martin is one of Australia's best known aviculturists, a specialist
in Neophemas - or grass parrots, as they are known there. He has lectured at
many meetings, including some in the UK. In 1989 Australian Birdkeeper
published his book A Guide to... Neophema &amp; Psephotus Grass Parrots - an
invaluable and colourful manual on the subject. Now the revised edition
has been published. This is even more colourful, containing photographs of
some of the newer mutations. Its 88 glossy pages contain an incredible 180
colour photographs. This is true to Australian Birdkeeper's style of never
stinting on colour.
As a photographic guide to species and mutations alone it is worth much
more than the #13.95 for which it sells in the UK. Some of the mutations
depicted are not available in the UK; nevertheless, it is interesting to observe
that in Australia there are pied, cinnamon, red-winged and olive Hooded
Parrakeets, for example. Redrump mutations are shown in 31 photographs
- the lutino opaline is especially eye-catching.
This book covers all the Neophemas , Redrumps, Many-colours, Blue-
bonnets, Hoodeds and Golden-shouldereds. Under each species there is
information on sexing and mutations. In addition there is advice on housing,
feeding, breeding, nest-boxes, hybrids (they must be avoided, says the
author), ringing, keeping records and surgical sexing.
This is a highly practical guide, written as the result of years of experience.
For example, Toby Martin relates how one day he found a number of young
birds (Bourke's, Turquoisines and Splendids) dead on the floor in holding
aviaries.His first thought was that cats or owls had disturbed them during
the night. When he mentioned the occurrence to another breeder, he asked
if there were any Elegants in the same aviary. There were. He was told that
Elegants 'bomb' the other birds at dusk and hit them on the head with their
beaks. He went to the aviaries at dusk - and that is exactly what was
happening. Since then he has never housed young Elegants with other
Neophemas.
This book is an absolute must for all breeders of these beautiful Australian
parrakeets. It is available price #13.95 plus 75p postage from The Bookshop,

collection
This latest offering from South Africa's Avicultural Research Unit (ARU)
is a valuable addition to modern avicultural literature for it contains much
original material - particularly in relation to nutrition (with detailed
information about foods consumed in the wild by many species), breeding
behaviour, husbandry, descriptions (including, where applicable, succinct
but informative notes on identifiable races and an invariably useful array of
synonyms for many species.
I confess that I remain somewhat nonplussed by the choice and range of
species chosen for inclusion in the book. They include among others
partridges, francolins, button quail, guineafowl, pigeons and doves,
sandgrouse, parrots and a comprehensive array of weavers, whydahs,
waxbills, etc. Softbilled species are not included, but - oddly, I think - the
Congo Peafowl makes an appearance among better known gallinaceous
species.
When judging any good book - and this is a good one - reviewers, if they
are honest, will admit to a need to discover some kind of pinprick error on
which to heap criticism if only to prove they have read the work from cover
to cover! Well, I spotted one or two minor inaccuracies: Baglafecht (Weaver)
becomes 'Bagafecht', in both text and index. There are also one or two type
lapses in which capitals should have replaced lower-case. But there is so
much that is good and informative, and the authors' efforts to make the
book useful are so transparently obvious, that such transgressions should
not be allowed to diminish its value to aviculturists.
Edited by Neville Brickell and Trevor Konigkrammer, one of its most
important aspects is that it draws heavily on the experience and expertise of
many practicing South African aviculturists. It has more than 270 pages
including a central section of generally excellent colour photographs
depicting 47 species. Many accurate black-and-white illustrations by Rex
M. Shirley and Karen de Klerk complement the informative text.
Aside from the separate species' descriptions and information, there are
chapters dealing with housing, breeding, feeding, diseases, vermin, catching
and handling - even hints on photographing birds in captivity. There are
also 15 pages of distribution maps covering 300 species.
Would this be a worthwhile addition to your library? Well, if you keep
or are particularly interested in the families dealt with (specifically:

On a purely personal note, I had never expected my name to be included
among among a book's references in company with the late A.D. (Dudley)
Nourse, one of South Africa's cricketing legends and an aviculturist of
considerable ability who maintained a large collection at his home in Natal.
I was introduced to him during a 1950's Springbok tour to the UK and we
met on a couple of occasions at Old Trafford cricket ground when he broke-
off from net practice to talk about birds in general - and specifically how he
might be able to add one or two European species to his collection. I have
not allowed this reminder of what I remember as a privileged and much
cherished relationship to influence my opinion of what I regard as an

<bodyText confidence="0.878690533333333" page_id="56285822"  page_num="36" year="" vol="">
concise edition based on The Handbook of the Birds of Europe, the Middle
East and North Africa: Birds of the Western Palearctic, which was completed
in 1994. The original nine volumes have been condensed into the present
two - Vol-I Non-passerines (Ostrich to Woodpeckers) and Vol.2 Passerines
(Tyrant Flycatchers to Warblers) - totalling over 1,800 pages. They have
been edited by Dr David Snow and Professor Christopher Perrins.
This new concise edition includes an additional 80 species. This is the
result of new species having been recorded in the region during the
intervening years (the original project began in the 1970s) and others having
been reclassified, and brings the total number of species described to 936.
It is a fantastic array of species including as it does all the usual western
European species, plus those of eastern Europe and western Russia, the
Middle East and North Africa. Also included are North American vagrants/
accidentals and 'exotic' introductions and escapees. In the latter catergories
are species such as the Avadavat, Common Waxbill, African and Indian

which has been recorded breeding in Germany and the south of France. Not
in these categories, but included in their own right are the Blue-naped
Mousebird, which gets as far north as Mauritania and has been observed in
northern Mali (and therefore just within North Africa), and the Grey-headed
Kingfisher, whose range includes the Cape Verde Islands.
The 600 colour plates, the majority of which occupy just over one-third
of a page each, illustrate most if not quite all of the species (I noticed that a
few of the 'exotic' introductions/escapees are not illustrated) and races,
showing when applicable an example of a male, female and juvenile in
various plumages, e.g. summer, autumn, first winter; many birds are also
shown in flight. The artists include (in alphabetical order) Norman Arlott,
Trevor Boyer, Robert Gillmor, Alan Harris, Ian Lewington, Chris Rose and
Dan Zetterstrom.
With the inclusion of an extra 80 species and more than 230 new colour
plates to illustrate these additional species or to replace earlier paintings, it
is obvious that an enormous amount of other material has had to be omitted
in order to condense the original nine volumes into the present two. I have
not been able to compare this edition with the original, but gather that the
typeface in the two volume set is marginally smaller, the sonograms have
gone and, of course the text has been drastically slimmed down. So, while
really serious birdwatchers may not find all the information they would
like, aviculturists with an interest in the birds of this vast area will in the
main, I think, find it a splendid addition to their library. It is not cheap, of
course, but then few bird books are these days, especially such well produced
books with so many colour plates.
It is available only as a two-volume hardback set (ISBN 0 19 854099 X)
priced #150. It can be ordered from specialist booksellers or direct from
Oxford University Press by telephoning 01536 454 534 (within the UK) or

Birds of the Western Palearctic is also about to become available on a
CD-ROM, described as combining 'the landmark nine volume series, the
new concise edition, extensive video footage and sound recordings.'
Oxford University Press is also publishing at regular intervals in the
form of a journal, BWP Update.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9964347" page_id="56285824"  page_num="38" year="" vol="">
At the Council Meeting held on the 4th April, I reported to the Council
that there had been absolutely no response to A Suggestion for a New Award'
by Philip Schofield (Vol.103, No.3,pp. 143-144), in which he suggested a
new award that recognises 'services to aviculture '.
Neither had I received any response to the questions 1 posed under the
heading 'What do you think?' The lack of any response must have come as
no surprise to one of my predecessors as Editor, namely Prof Hodges, who
has long been critical of the almost total lack of response from the
membership to issues raised in the magazine.
Since the Council Meeting I have however received one reply. It came
from Philip King in Canada. He started his letter by asking if I remember
him from 1964-1966, when he worked at the Bird House at London Zoo? /
do and recall that he was nicknamed l P. King Robin&apos;. I had though forgotten
that I proposed him for membership of the Society, back in those days when
this was how it was done. He still has his letter of acceptance from A. A.
Prestwich, and has remained a member ever since.
Philip arrived in Winnipeg in 1972, to work in the newly-planned Tropical
House (similar in design to that at Chester Zoo) being designed by the then-
Director, Clive Roots, who hired him. Philip is still at Winnipeg Zoo. He
said nothing though about the present whereabouts of Clive Roots, who
many members will remember principally from when he was Curator at
Winged World, and described in the magazine many notable UK first
breedings there. - Ed.
With regard to the suggestion for a new award and in answer to the
question 'What do you think?', Philip King wrote:-
'Basically I agree with the concept of broadening the criteria for
qualification, and think that focusing on propagation in all its aspects rather
than first breedings alone would be a good step. I think one has to take care,
however, to use the definition 'aviculture' very carefully. Does, for example,
breeding vast quantities of birds for the pet or hobby market equate to the
successful and repeated propagation of an endangered species, or a species
rare or difficult to keep in captivity? I think not. If one looks at the stated
objectives of the Society - 'the study of British and foreign birds in freedom
and captivity' - one should assume that this would seem to indicate rather
substantial values.
I have been a member of the American Zoo &amp; Aquarium Association for
almost as long as I have been a member of the Avicultural Society, and it has
changed its philosophy regarding the awarding of the Edward H. Bean Award,
which used to be for first breedings only. It is now given for such things as
breeding programmes almost exclusively. In short, I suppose that I agree

with broadening the scope of the award, but first breedings should continue
to be eligible.
Lastly, a revival of the 'Letters to the Editor' feature would be a welcome
move, especially if answers or comments are to be provided.

A Council Meeting was held on Saturday, 4th April 1998 at Paultons
Park, Hampshire.
The following members were present: Prof. J.R. Hodges and R.C.J.
Sawyer (Vice Presidents), K.J. Lawrence (Chairman), M. Curzon, M. Ellis
(Hon. Editor), R. Grantham, N. Hewston, R.E. Oxley, S. Pyper, P.J. Schofield,
J. Trollope, Ms. Rosemary Wiseman.
During 1997 there was again a small increase in membership and it is
now higher than it has been for some time. The Council expressed its
gratitude to the Hon. Secretary/Treasurer and his staff at Bristol Zoo for
their continued help with the smooth running of the Society, which remains
in a sound financial position.
It was agreed that the use of colour illustrations have added considerably
to the quality of the magazine, and it was agreed to budget for colour
illustrations in the magazine during 1998. With this in mind, the Council
agreed to the Hon. Editor's suggestion, that he relaunch the Colour Plate
Fund.
It was agreed to award the Society's Medal for the first breeding of a
species in Britain and Ireland to Eric Callaghan for the breeding of the Three-
banded Rosefinch Carpodacus trifasciatus, and the Society's Certificate of
Merit to Leeds Castle for the breeding of the Toco Toucan Ramphastos toco.
The Council noted that the young were parent reared.
The Rev. Ramon Noegel was elected an Honorary Life Member in
recognition of his outstanding contribution to aviculture and W.D. Cummings,
who joined the Society in 1948, was also elected a Life Member.
The Society has been asked by the International Touraco Society, to note
that the latter holds its AGM on the first Sunday in April. Next year this will
be 4th April. We have therefore been requested to keep this particular
weekend free.
The meeting closed with a vote of thanks to the owners of Paultons Park
for allowing us to hold our meeting there.

YELLOW-TAILED PYTILIA

<bodyText confidence="0.978006" page_id="56285826"  page_num="40" year="" vol="">
Geoff and Hilary Welch, who have undertaken several expeditions to
Djibouti, north-east Africa, and studied the autumn migration of raptors,
the endemic Djibouti Francolin Francolinus ochropectus and the threatened
Arabian Bustard Ardeotis arabs, have discovered what they believe is a
previously undescribed race of the Melba Finch or Green-winged Pytilia
Pytilia melba and a sunbird which does not appear to resemble any known
species. The male pytilia's forehead, face, throat and upper breast are golden-
yellow instead of the usual red and the outer tail feathers are bright yellow,
with the central tail feathers being greenish. His bill is pinkish with a grey
culmen and the legs and feet are also pinkish. In the absence of a museum
specimen, the race has been provisionally named the Yellow-tailed Pytilia.
A fuller description along with a colour photo and a painting of the male
pytilia and of the sunbird, can be found in the African Bird Club Bulletin ,
Vo 1.5, No.l, March 1998, together with colour photos of the Djibouti
Francolin, which looks very like ErckePs Francolin F. erckelii.

Details of the pytilia described above has, Neville Brickell has written
to say, caused South African aviculturist, Kenny Hand, to recall informing
the late Prof. Christo Pienaar of his (Kenny Hand's) 1986 observation of
pytilias with a similar coloration occurring alongside those of the nominate
race in an area of the Kathu district of northern Cape Province. Recently a
photograph was published in the South African bird keeping magazine
Avizandum and this has aroused much interest by aviculturists there. Kenny
Hand's aviary successes with these birds have revealed that the nestlings
and immature birds do not differ from those of the nominate race, it is only
when they reach maturity that they get the yellow coloration in their plumage.

The Pink-headed Duck Rhodonessa carophyllacea is generally thought
to have become extinct in the wild in 1935. There have however been reports
occasionally of sightings of it, coming mostly from northern India and
northern Burma, and the suggestion that it may be breeding in adjacent areas
of Tibet. Now, two Britons, Peter Gladstone and Charles Martel!, have set
off to search for it on a lake and an area of marshland 14,000ft (approx.
4,250m) above sea level and 1,000 miles (approx. 1,600km) east of the
Tibetan capital, Llasa, where it is reputed to be breeding. It was reported
that they will also be looking for the Himalayan Mountain Quail Ophrysia
supercilliosa which was thought to have become extinct in 1868, but of
which there was a rumour of one being shot in the period 1948-1952 and an
unconfirmed sighting in 1982.

Pink-headed Ducks at Foxwarren Park. The last surviving
specimen there died around the end of the Second World War
Although it is though to have become extinct in the wild in 1935, the
Pink-headed Duck survived in captivity for a few years longer. The following
item is reproduced from News &amp; Views, Vol.74, No.4, p.153, 1968:-
'Visitors to Foxwarren Park during 1925-1938 were greatly privileged
had they but known it, to see some of the last survivors of what is now
generally believed to be an extinct species - the Indian Pink-headed Duck
Rhodonessa carophyllacea.
Our late President Mr. Alfred Ezra, through the good offices of his brother
Sir David Ezra, of Calcutta, received five living specimens, three drakes
and two ducks, in July 1925. One drake died as a result of an accident and
another, a month after arrival of an infection of the eye. In 1929 ten more
ducks arrived, most of which were retained at Foxwarren Park. By 1938
there was but a sole survivor. In 1941 Mr Ezra recorded: 'At one time I had
as many as ten of these birds, and some of them lived over ten years'
(Avicultural Magazine , 1941, p.141). There was a pair at Cleres in 1925,

This duck has not been reliably reported in the wild since 1935, apart
from a correspondent in the August, 1966, number of the Journal of the
Bombay Natural History Society, who claims to have shot one of a flock of
six on 27th January, 1947, in Bihar; and to have seen five to eight of them in
1948-49 on Lake Manroopa. An extensive two-year search has just been
concluded in Burma. No trace of this duck was found and it must be regarded
as definitely extinct there.'

NOTEWORTHY END TO 1997
Last year some 776 chicks were successfully reared to independence at
Loro Parque. Plum-crowned Pionus Pionus tumultuosus , Blue-eyed
Cockatoo Cacatua ophthalmica, Hoffmann's Conure Pyrrhura hoffmanni
and Musk Lorikeet Glossopsitta concinna all bred successfully for the first

time and 1997 ended with the hatching of a Pesquet's Parrot Psittrichas
fulgidus, the rearing of which is described on pp 14-16.
Sixty-eight cockatoo chicks were raised, including a Gang-gang
Callocephallon fimbriatum, two Red-vented Cockatoos Cacatua
haematuropygia, a Citron-crested Cockatoo C. sulphurea citrinocristata ,
eight Moluccan Cockatoos C. moluccensis and the aforementioned Blue-
eyed Cockatoo. Among the 74 Loridae chicks reared, probably the most
important were nine Red and Blue Lories Eos histrio, two Mount Apo
Lorikeets Trichoglossus johnstoniae and a Mitchell's Lorikeet T haematodus
mitchellii.
Other breedings of particular note included three Blue-naped Parrots
Tanygnathus lucionensis , four Green-winged King Parrots Alisterus
chloropterus moszkowskii, a Blue-rumped Parrot Psittinus cyanurus and a
New Caledonian Horned Parrakeet Eunymphicus cornutus. The Greater
Vasa Parrot Coracopsis vasa and Lesser Vasa or Black Parrot C. nigra bred,
as did both the park's forms of the Grey Parrot Psittacus erithacus erithacus
and P. e. timneh and all seven Poicephalus species. The Cape Parrots P
robustus had a particularly good breeding season, with five pairs rearing a
total of 14 young.
Seventy-five macaws were reared, the majority by their parents. Thirteen
Red-fronted Macaws Ara rubrogenys were produced by four breeding pairs
and three pairs of Blue-throated Macaws A. glaucogularis raised six chicks.

The Blue-throated species now has an international studbook. The conures
all had a good breeding season in which 81 Aratinga, eight Cyanoliseus,
eight Enicognathus and 171 Pyrrhura were reared. The most productive
were the Sun Conures A. solstitial is which produced 36 young, followed by
the Crimson-bellied Conures P. perlata perlata with 31, the Pearly-throated
Conures P perlata lepida with 27 and the Blue-throated Conures with 24
young.
In addition to the Plum-crowned Pionus, four other Pionus species
produced young. Seventy-five Amazon parrots were reared and both the
Hawk-headed Parrots Deroptyus acciptrinus and the Purple-bellied Parrots
Triclaria malachitacea again reared young.
On Thursday, 17th December 1997, Loro Parque celebrated the 25th
Anniversary of its founding. Wolfgang Kiessling, owner of Loro Parque
and President of the Loro Parque Fundacion, together with more than 500
guests assembled in the park. The guests included leaders of the local
authorities, representatives of the tourist sector, diplomats from various
European, African and Asian countries, scientific advisors to the fundacion,

YEAR OF CHANGE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986270307692308" page_id="56285829"  page_num="43" year="" vol="">
Last year was a year of change on the bird section at Bristol Zoo and
will be remembered for the building of the new, large walk-through aviary,
the Wallace Aviary. Named after Alfred Russel Wallace, it displays birds
from Indonesia and the Philippines, the region of the world explored by
Wallace and the study of whose natural history led him to propose his theory
of evolution through natural selection, at about the same time that Charles
Darwin was formulating his own theory about the origin of species. The
building work meant that many of the zoo's birds had to be housed in
temporary accommodation but, thanks to the excellent work of the bird staff
and the support of other departments, some good breeding results were
achieved.
The year began with the flamingoes cohabiting with the storks and geese.
It is the first time this has happened. Much time and thought has gone into

designing the new flamingo exhibit and on its completion it is hoped to
substantially increase the size of the flock, with the view to breeding these
wonderful birds. The Hawaiian Geese or Nene Branta sandvicensis proved
that they were unconcerned about sharing with the flamingoes by hatching
young which for the first time were allowed to remain with their parents.
Three goslings were raised and the flock now numbers nine.
Two pairs of Roulroul Partridges Rollulus roulroul were imported from
Arnhem Zoo for the new aviary. When its completion was delayed, they
spent the summer laying eggs, with the result that by the end of the year the
number of Roulroul Partridges had risen to 13. A new male received early
in the year settled down quickly and produced the desired result with the
Palawan Peacock Pheasants Polyplectron emphanum, also destined for the
new aviary, which produced four young during the summer.
Bristol Zoo continues to do well with Luzon Bleeding Heart Doves
Gallicolumba luzonica and now has two pairs, which raised young during
the course of the year. Towards the end of 1997, Bartlett's G. criniger, were
also added to the collection. The zoo is strengthening its links with the
Philippines and hopes to ensure that these and other species are protected in
the wild.
A single Bali Starling Leucopsar rothschildi was reared. This may not
seem particularly notable, but if one considers that at the last count there
were only 14 remaining in the wild, each one reared has great significance.
The zoo was also especially pleased to breed an Egyptian Vulture
Neophron percnopterus, which was hatched in an incubator and reared by
keepers. This species is rarely bred in zoos and is therefore another significant
achievement. The Griffon Vultures Gyps fulvus have been sent to Chester
Zoo, thereby allowing Bristol Zoo to modify the aviary which now houses
the Toco Toucans Ramphastos toco , Lilacine Amazons Amazona autumnalis
lilacina and various passerines.

Paignton Zoo's pair of Australian Cassowaries Casuarius casuarius
which last year produced their first youngster, have gone one better this
year and two chicks have been produced. The male incubated the eggs for
60 days and is now caring for the chicks. The adults, which came from
Edinburgh Zoo ten years ago, will only tolerate each other for as long as it
takes them to mate and are normally housed in separate runs. Prior to last
year, the pair's breeding attempts all ended in failure. It was not until as
part of the zoo's redevelopment plan, they were moved to their new woodland
enclosure, which aims to replicate their natural habitat, that they started to
breed successfully.

ROY HARVEY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.931214090909091" page_id="56285834"  page_num="48" year="" vol="">
Roy Harvey, founder of Birdworld, near Farnham, Surrey and a former
Avicultural Society Council Member, has died aged 67. Roy was originally
a dairy farmer, when in the mid-1960s he and his wife Pat had to decide
whether to sell their farm and buy a larger one, or give up farming and turn
their hobby of bird keeping into a full time interest.
They chose the latter, and after a long search found the site of a rundown
nursery, which was overgrown and a total mess, on which to start their bird
garden. Surrounded by the Alice Holt Forest and situated beside a main
road, close to several large towns and within easy reach of London, it proved
to be a wise choice.
Birdworld opened to the public the 15th June 1968. Over the years an
excellent mixed collection has been built up and an incubation research
station, education facilities, a bookshop and aquarium added. In 1996, the
Avicultural Society's Certificate of Merit was awarded to Birdworld for the
first breedings in Britain and Ireland of the Black-crested Guineafowl Guttera
pucherani edouardi. Mountain Peacock Pheasant Polyplectron inopinatum
and Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker Picoides macei.
It continued to be run successfully by the Harvey family until very
recently, when it was bought by the family company which owns the garden
centre adjacent to Birdworld.
The Society offers its condolences to Roy's widow, Pat, daughter, Kate,
and sons David and Rob.

SAVING THE ENDANGERED ORANGE-BELLIED
PARRAKEET

There can be no doubt that captive breeding has provided a means for
the conservation of several species of birds which have been threatened
with extinction. Often there has been no real hope for their re-establishment
in the wild because of the disappearance of their natural habitat. However,
it cannot be denied that their preservation as aviary-bred strains, rather than
as stuffed, decaying specimens in museums is desirable. This opinion is
apparently not shared by the so-called 'recovery team' for the Orange-bellied
Parrakeet Neophema chrysogaster which continues its efforts to save the
species from extinction. The team consists mainly of a large group of amateur
and professional biologists and bureaucrats from State National Parks and
Wildlife Services. It has spent a lot of money and generated a wealth of
publications with a conspicuous lack of success in achieving its objective.
The Orange-bellied Parrakeet is no less critically endangered now than it
was in 1984 when the recovery team was set up. Although they have resorted
to captive breeding to produce specimens to release into the wild, they have
neither been prepared to distribute potential breeding birds to reputable
aviculturists nor even to take advantage of their knowledge and expertise. I
think that the team's scorn for aviculture and aviculturists is the fundamental
reason for its dismal performance which appears doomed to failure.
The Orange-bellied Parrakeet ('Parrot' in Australia) is not unlike the
Elegant N. elegans or the Blue-winged N. chrysostoma but the green areas
are an intense bright grass-green and the blue frontal band and wing edges
are a very deep royal blue. The chest and breast are yellow and the belly is
a bright flaming orange. The incredible shimmering loveliness of the first
male which I saw in the wild was enchanting. The present-day habitat of
most of the couple of hundred survivors of this species is within a few miles
of Melaleuca in south-west Tasmania where they breed between October
and March. They then migrate from this unpopulated, virtually unexplored
wilderness area, via King Island in the Bass Straits, to the coastal areas of

south-west Victoria where they spend the winters on the salt marshes, dunes
and pastures near the coast. In complete contrast to their summer habitat,
this is an area which is being increasingly lost to industrial development.
The Tasmanian habitat has been improved by controlled burning to enhance
the growth of seeding grasses on which the birds feed and by the introduction
of artificial nest-boxes which have been acceptable to many breeding pairs.
The Victorian habitat, particularly the most important area in Port Phillip
Bay, has been constantly threatened by industrial development but, recently,
the Victorian Government has become more sympathetic and has allocated
appropriate wetland areas for the conservation of the Orange-bellied
Parrakeet and other migratory birds.
Organised counts are being made every year by volunteers. The numbers
in Tasmania are fairly constant but those in Victoria appear to be dwindling.
Attempts are now being made to use tiny transmitters to trace the birds and
improve the accuracy of the counts. The work has provided great advances
in our knowledge of the biology of the Orange-bellied Parrakeet but,
regrettably, has not yet led to a significant increase in the population of the
species in the wild. Their re-establishment appears to present almost
insurmountable problems.
However, they can still be seen in fair numbers at Melaleuca where a
small observatory has been built using materials brought in by helicopter.
Melaleuca can be reached by boat, by a week's arduous hike or by air. Of
course, I chose the latter and, with my wife and two friends, chartered for
about #800 (approx. US$1,280), a Cessna aircraft from a company called,
rather unimaginatively, 'Paravion'. Early one morning last October when
the weather was fair enough we took off from Hobart for Melaleuca with
two pilots flying through the clouds with the mountain tops suddenly
appearing at frequent intervals perilously close to the wing tips. After about
an hour's flight the clouds appeared to part and before us was the west coast
and the sea. We could see the hide quite close to the landing strip in the
middle of unattractive country, with a few eucalypts and lots of scrub
surrounded by barren rocky slopes. We landed and after a walk through the
uninviting scrub, a boat ride and a picnic on the boat in the pouring rain, we
made our way to the hide where we were greeted by two young, enthusiastic
ornithologists. They were volunteers spending their holidays camping and
working at the site. The hide was a fairly large wooden building. Its walls
were plastered with informative posters on the natural history of the locality
and there was even a television set receiving live pictures, from a nest-box
in a eucalypt close by, of a sitting female with the male standing in the
entrance hole. The hide provided a perfect view of a group of trees in which
the birds were nesting in natural hollows as well as in the artificial nest-
boxes. There was also a long perch with a feeding tray placed in a strategic

position for a perfect view of the birds from the hide. Here, and in the
surrounding trees, were about 20 of these lovely birds with their conspicuous
flame-orange underparts contrasting with the general greyness of the sky
and landscape. With them were a few Green Rosellas Platycercus
caledonicus and Beautiful Firetails Stagonopleura bellum of which the
Orange-bellied Parrakeets seemed more nervous than of the Green Rosellas.
After watching them for an hour or so we reluctantly left the hide, boarded
our aircraft and departed, flying back to Hobart along the beautiful southern
coast with lovely beaches and no people. It had been a wonderful and exciting
day.
A member of the recovery team since its inception is Peter Brown who
was once a member of the Council of the Avicultural Society. Before
emigrating to Tasmania he was in charge of the birds at Hare wood Bird
Garden near Leeds. Although he had developed reservations about the ethics
of aviculture and the part which it can play in conservation he was
instrumental in the development of a captive breeding programme. When I
visited the aviaries with him in 1985 Rock Parrakeets N. petrophila and
Blue-winged Parrakeets were being used in a pilot study. The success of
these breeding trials and the subsequent release of the aviary-bred birds led
to the extension of the breeding experiments with Orange-bellieds and when
I visited the establishment again three years later with Peter Brown there
were a few pairs breeding successfully. Unfortunately several of the young
birds developed beak and feather syndrome and many of them died. The
unfortunate occurrence of this avicultural scourge, which is now known as
Psittacine Circoviral Disease, appeared to destroy the possibility of
introducing aviary-bred birds into the wild but the viral disease was soon
found to occur in wild Orange-bellied Parrakeets. Work is still being done
on the disease and it is now possible to identify birds carrying the infection
and perhaps it will lead to the development of an effective vaccine.
I visited the breeding complex, again with Peter Brown, last year. The
aviaries had been moved to a new location less exposed than the one I had
seen previously. The breeding results have improved considerably and 20-
30 young healthy birds have been produced almost every year. Since 1991
ten or more captive bred birds have been liberated annually mostly at
Melaleuca but some at Birch's Inlet which is about 70 miles (approx. 113km)
north of Melaleuca and where a breeding colony existed many years ago.
The captive birds remained in the release area at Melaleuca, most of them
paired with other released birds or with wild birds and many pairs were
successful in rearing their young. However the aviary-bred specimens tended
to be reluctant to migrate and most left Melaleuca much later than the wild
stock, many never to be seen again. However some have made it and have
been seen in Victoria, and a few have returned to Melaleuca. Obviously,
they can migrate but they do not seem very keen.

Keeping the breeding pairs in adjoining aviaries in one location, risking
the possibility of losing the entire stock through an infectious disease appears
to me to be poor conservation policy. In spite of their own avicultural success
the members of the recovery team are apparently so scornful of aviculture
generally that no sympathetic consideration has been given to distributing
some of the stock to well-known, competent aviculturists. However, some
captive bred birds were transferred to Healesville Sanctuary, near Melbourne,
but, as far as I know, no reports of the outcome have appeared. I cannot
understand why the appropriate departments in Tasmania and Victoria have
not adopted or even considered the policy of the Western Australia
Department of Conservation and Land Management with respect to the
Naretha Blue-bonnet Parrot Northiella haematogaster narethae. Working
with a few private aviculturists the department has instituted an outstandingly
successful and financially profitable breeding programme with this rare race
of the Blue-bonnet. In contrast, hundreds of thousands of dollars have been
spent by the Tasmanian and Victorian authorities on a very ambitious
programme to conserve the endangered Orange-bellied Parrakeet but still
there are no more specimens in the wild than there were when the scheme
was commenced nearly 20 years ago. Perhaps it is no wonder that the

INSTANCES OF ABERRANT PLUMAGE AMONG
AFRICAN SERINUS SPECIES

The species which in southern Africa we call the Yellow-eyed Canary
and which most aviculturists elsewhere call the Green Singing Finch Serinus
mozambicus is, of course, a popular and long-established avicultural subject.
The closely related Black-throated Canary or Yellow-rumped Seedeater S.
atrogularis is also a well-established avicultural subject, but has never been
as popular as the former.
The Oxford Dictionary defines aberrant as 'straying from moral standard
or diverging from normal type'.
Thirty-nine years have passed since Michael P. Stuart Irwin, Director of
the National Museum in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe reported interesting examples
of instability in the S. mozambicus and S. atrogularis group from southern
Mozambique, where aberrants have been found in flocks of Yellow-eyed
Canaries or Green Singing Finches. The latter probably are of the race S. m.
grand , which occurs in the extreme northern part of Zululand (South Africa)
and the extreme southern part of Mozambique. Skead (1960) suggested
that this is something which would be worth further investigation. However,
it was not something which was taken up by Dr Phillip Clancey (1996) in
his up-dated work on the birds of southern Mozambique.
Irwin stated: 'These differ from mozambicus both in colour and pattern
and show an approach in characters to atrogularis. The mantle is a uniform
brown (streaked) instead of the usual green; the feathers on the crown have
darker and broader centres, but with pale isabelline edges; sides of face to
lores dusky, eye-stripe faint or absent; dusky grey-brown loral streak present
and in this character showing affinity with mozambicus. The entire underparts
are isabelline; bill dark horn, more strongly pigmented than in other species,
but closer to atrogularis'.
Recently while fishing on the bank of the Pongola River in the Ndumu
region, in thick foliage adjacent to the water's edge Trevor Konigkramer
observed approximately 30 individuals of the Serinus family which he was
unable to identify in Roberts' Birds of Southern Africa (1993). The birds
were feeding on the fruits of the Black Jack Bidens pilosa and the yellow
flowering heads of the Gallant Soldier Galinsoga parviflora. Feeding
alongside them were small family groups of Bully Canaries S. sulphuratus ,
Lemon-breasted Canaries S. citrinipectus and Yellow-eyed Canaries or Green
Singing Finches. Neville Brickell who was on a photographic trip to northern
Zululand was located and was able to photograph one of these unidentified
canaries for future reference.

KEEPING AND BREEDING FIG PARROTS OF THE
GENUS Psittaculirostris AT VOGELPARK WALSRODE

The representatives of the genus Psittaculirostris are medium-sized
(lScm-2Qcm (approx. 7in-7 3 .4in long)), stocky parrots, with colourful
plumage. Their most prominent features are the extremely short, rounded
tail, the elongated ear-coverts and proportionally large bill with a prominent
notch in the upper mandible.
Fig parrots are distributed throughout different regions of New Guinea,
where they can be found primarily in fruit-bearing trees, especially fig trees.
Here, we do not attempt to give full descriptions of the three
Psittaculirostris species, as they can easily be distinguished by referring to
the relevant literature or the photos used to illustrate this article. We believe
that the following short notes should be sufficient:
Desmarest's, Golden-headed or Large Fig Parrot P. desmarestii
Occurs in forested lowlands, hill forests and occasionally the savannas
of the western Papuan islands, as well as western and southern New Guinea,
locally up to 1,500m (approx. 4,900ft). Unlike the other species of this
genus, which are monotypic, up to six well defined geographical races of it
have been described. All are mainly green with the typical contrasting fiery-
orange forehead and orange-yellow crown and nape, blue breast markings
and blue on the flight feathers. In this species the sexes are alike.
SalvadorPs or Whiskered Fig Parrot P. salvadorii
Endemic to lowland forest and the forest edge, up to 400m (approx.
1,300ft), in northern Irian Jaya. Extensive logging and land clearance,
associated with extensive trapping, are considered to be causing a rapid
decline in its numbers and have led to it being listed as vulnerable. Sexual
dimorphism is well developed in this species: adult males have a red breast,
whereas adult females have broad bands of pale bluish-green across their
breast. Both sexes have a blue mark behind the eyes.
Edwards' Fig Parrot P. edwardsii
Distributed throughout lowland and hill forest, also partly cleared land,
in north-eastern New Guinea. This species was in the past thought to be a
race of Salvadori's Fig Parrot. The most striking features of Edwards' Fig
Parrot are the broad blue-black band on the upper breast, the red belly and
lower breast (females lack this red on the breast) and the broad black line
through the eyes to the hindcrown and nape.

Their fascinating behaviour and vivacious nature make fig parrots among
the most attractive of the parrots. They are gregarious, very active and
playful birds, which become tame easily. While acclimatising and keeping
the Psittaculirostris species is no longer a problem, breeding successes still
need to be improved in order to establish viable populations. In the mid-
1970s a good number of fig parrots were imported into Europe and the
USA. At that time there was no detailed information available about these
species, we knew only that keeping fig parrots seemed to be difficult, and
therefore only a few enthusiasts purchased these birds.
Vogelpark Walsrode was one of the first institutions to take up the
challenge to keep these three species of fig parrots and to improve the
breeding results with them. During the early years the loss of some birds
had to be accepted, but this led to even more intensive efforts to achieve
satisfying breeding results. Up until that time and - still today sometimes -
there are those who believe that a deficiency of Vitamin K, which delays
blood-clotting, causes the death of these birds. Therefore even the slightest
injuries such as those caused by flying against the wire of the enclosure, are
supposed to be the reason for birds bleeding to death. As an additional
supply of Vitamin K did not result in any improvement in the keeping of the
adults or in the hatching of chicks, we decided to try other ways.
The first improvements came when we added an amino-acid supplement
to the food. We noticed increased breeding activity and did not lose any of
the adults. During this 'time of experimentation' chicks hatched, but died
within the first 18 days. At that time, about the end of the 1980s and the
beginning of the 1990s, the results of investigations by keepers in the USA
were published which dealt with the causes of death in Psittaculirostris
chicks. The surprising result of these investigations was the fact that young
fig parrots are obviously unable to digest the seeds of figs and apples, etc.,
as adult birds do. Even soft and spouting seeds are a potential danger to
young birds. These results caused us to reconsider the diet we fed to the fig
parrots and, together with other breeders, we worked on a new combination
of ingredients. After a short period of re-adaption to this new diet, it was
very well accepted by the birds.
Today, the Psittaculirostris species' diet consists of the following, which
is fed to them twice a day in clean bowls. It is sufficient for approximately
ten birds.

All of the ingredients are mixed in a blender until they form a paste-like
substance.
We also offer a variety of spouted seeds and pulses, including sunflower
seeds, mung beans and a seed mixture intended for pigeons. These are
soaked in 5 litres (just over I gallon) of water to which we add two Chinosol
tablets to prevent them from becoming mouldy. They are soaked for
approximately eight hours, after which they are thoroughly rinsed with clean
running water and then kept in a sieve and allowed to sprout for about 24
hours. In addition to the above, we also offer maize and rice which has been
boiled for ten minutes.
Every other day 5ml of one of the following supplements is added to the
food: powdered yeast, Muschelkalk (ground shells which provide calcium),
powdered soya-malt, Nekton Tonik K (vitamin/mineral supplement for seed-
eating birds).
The food for the adult birds consists of the above mentioned paste (fed
twice a day) and, once a day, one tablespoon of spouted seeds and pulses
and half a dried fig (which has been soaked) per pair. The seeds, pulses and
figs are provided up until two days before the chicks are expected to hatch.
From then until the chicks are 14 days old, the only food we offer the birds
is the paste. Then from 15 days old onwards, we add ten blanched mealworms
per day.
When the young birds have fledged, we again feed our basic fig parrot
diet (the paste, seeds, pulses and figs) and stop offering mealworms. About
two weeks after fledging the offspring can be separated from their parents.
They should though be kept in a quiet area, as at the beginning they are very
timid.
As fig parrots like to use branches on which to clean their bills, they
should always have access to branches which have not been treated with
pesticides. The birds also peel the bark off the branches, and so get additional
minerals, roughage and tannin acids which have a dietetic effect.
It should be borne in mind that fig parrots are very active birds, which
enjoy bathing. They are also very curious. During the breeding season,

however, they can become very stressed, which can result in them abandoning
or even killing their chicks. This does not necessarily take place at the time
of the disturbance, but often occurs some days later.
Aggressive behaviour between males and females is seen only rarely,
and it is more or less easy to set up pairs. Keeping the birds in flocks of two
or more pairs, however, makes a big difference and, at breeding time, the
pairs should be kept separately. When keeping Psittaculirostris species in a
group of three pairs in a large enclosure, we found that all may hatch chicks,
but only those of one of the pairs survive to the age of fledging. We assume
that one of the pairs is dominant and suppresses the others, also the females
sometimes become very aggressive towards each other and bad injuries can
result.
Pairs do not in most cases seem to be difficult to please with regard to
nest-boxes, but there are some pairs which start breeding only after the nest-
boxes have been changed several times. The type of nest-box which is
preferred differs from pair to pair. Some tend to breed in small boxes which
have just a single entrance hole, others use boxes which have an extra opening
on the opposite side to the entrance hole, and some pairs prefer to gnaw a
second hole in the nest-box while incubating the eggs. When the chicks
reach about 14 days old the parents use this extra opening through which to
remove the chick's droppings, which is a great help in keeping the nest-box
clean and dry.

With the Psittaculirostris species incubation takes about 22 days and the
chicks fledge at about 45 -50 days old. After a further 14 days the young are
independent of their parents and can be separated. They are sexually mature
at 18 months to two years old, when the plumage is in full colour. With
Salvadori's Fig Parrots there is a difference between the sexes at the age of
14-18 months, and with Edwards' Fig Parrots the males start to show typical
male coloration at about ten months at the earliest.
By exchanging our experiences and newly-gained knowledge about the
husbandry and breeding of fig parrots, these beautiful birds which are unique
in appearance and behaviour, will more and more find their way into the
hearts and aviaries of &apos;parrot people'. Today, keeping fig parrots is one of
the most wonderful experiences those interested in keeping parrots can have,
especially as they no longer have to face the problems experienced with
them in the past.

In February 1996 a pair of Crowned Hornbills Tockus alboterminatus
were purchased for the Leeds Castle aviaries. We decided to work with this
species following our success with the closely related Von der Decken's
Hornbill T. deckeni (Avicultural Magazine , 98, 2: 44-47).
The new birds appeared quite drab in comparison to the Von der Decken's,
but as their general condition improved so did their appearance. Adult birds
are dark brown with a white breast and leg feathering and all but the central
tail feathers are broadly tipped with white. There are distinctive flecks of
white feathering above and behind the eyes, the irises of which are golden
coloured. The bill is dusky red, with the male's bill generally being larger
than the female's. The male's throat patches are black and those of the
female are blue. The call of this hornbill is a high-pitched piping whistle,
unlike the throaty calls of Von der Decken's Hornbill.

At the beginning of the 1997 breeding season two nest-boxes were
provided, one in the shelter and the other in the aviary. The boxes were of a
parrakeet nest-box design with a entrance hole just big enough for the female
to squeeze through. The base of the boxes was approximately 12in (30.5cm)
below the tip of the entrance hole. Nest material consisting of peat and
moistened shavings were added and pressed firmly into the base of the boxes.

On May 20th the female was seen inside the nest-box in the aviary and
was starting to mud-up the entrance hole. She spent the next ten days going
in and out of the box until May 31st, when the male was seen offering nesting-
material to the female inside the box. Later that same day he was seen
offering livefood to the female which now seemed to be sitting tight, although
the entrance hole had not been completely mudded up. Throughout the
first week of June the male continued to feed the female and also continued
to take up twigs and leaves. On June 3rd however the female left the box.
She was looking tatty and had no tail feathers and had obviously begun to
moult. Despite being a little concerned about her condition we decided to
leave her in the aviary. The male remained protective of her and fed her the
choicest livefood. Two days later she returned to the nest and continued to
mud-up the entrance. The female was now incubating properly and both
birds were continuing to mud-up the entrance hole. At this point, in addition
to the main feed, locusts were fed by hand to the male twice a day. The male
took the locusts directly to the nest and fed them to the female. In this way
we could gauge the health of the female by her appetite and also ensure that
the male was playing his part.
On July 16th there was a sudden increase in the amount of locusts taken
to the nest. We assumed that at least one chick had hatched and the following
day the keeper heard a chick squeaking inside the box. The next day at least
two voices were heard coming from inside the box. Approximately 20 locusts
were being taken at each feed and waxmoth larvae were also introduced to
supplement the other livefood. Foods such as fruit and pinkies were also
offered to the female from the main food dish, but only after the livefood
had gone.
Early on August 11th the female began breaking open the mud sealing
the entrance hole and by 11.30am she had left the box, having been inside
for 67 days. She was fully feathered and appeared well, although her bill
was very dirty. Later that day both adults were taking livefood to the nest-
box and the two chicks were re-sealing the entrance from the inside. During
the next week the male would take livefood to the female and she would
feed the young. On August 18th, both chicks were seen panting due to the
very hot weather and one side of the nest-box was hosed with water in order
to cool the chicks inside.
Three days later the slit in the mud was enlarged by the female, but the
chicks continued to re-seal it from inside. On the 25th the female re-entered
the nest-box and re-emerged an hour later. This behaviour was repeated
three days later; we assumed that the female was trying to encourage the
young to leave the nest or was wanting to lay a second clutch. On September
2nd, at mid-day, one of the youngsters finally fledged. This was 47 days
after the chicks had first been heard in the nest. The juvenile looked very

blue throat patches. As with the young Von der Decken's Hornbills, the
eyes were pale blue-grey. When begging for food it gave a low piping call
which was always answered by the adult male.

The following day the male was seen trying to entice the second youngster
out of the nest-box, which he did by sitting on the nest-box perch holding
livefood, but not offering it to the youngster there at the nest entrance. This
obviously proved too tempting for the second youngster and it left the nest
later that day. Within 24 hours of the second chick fledging the female was
back inside the nest-box with the entrance hole mudded-up again. For the
next two days keepers and the male hornbill were kept busy feeding livefood
to the youngsters. The male however was not taking food to the female in
the nest and the following day she left the nest-box and spent most of the
day feeding. She was still fully feathered and had obviously not started to
moult. The next day the female was back in the box and was begging for
food at the nest entrance but the male was still too busy feeding the young to
feed the female as well.
For the next five days the female was fed livefood in the nest by keepers
but she re-emerged within a couple of days. She was fully feathered and
there was no sign of any eggs having been laid. At this point the nest material
reached to within 4in (approx. 10cm) of the entrance hole. A second food
dish was placed in the flight for the youngsters, which soon learned to feed
themselves, although they continued to beg from the parents for about six
weeks. The nesting behaviour of the female continued over the following
couple of weeks but no more eggs were laid that year.
As described above, the two youngsters, which have now been placed
on breeding loan, were parent reared to independence. To our knowledge
this is the first UK breeding of this species.
As described by Laura Gardner, the Crowned Hornbill Tockus
alboterminatus, has been bred at Leeds Castle. This is probably the first
successful breeding of this species in Great Britain or Ireland. Anyone who
knows of a previous breeding is asked to inform the Hon. Secretary.
At the time that the above breeding account was submitted (13.8.98) the
pair had two more young in the nest. If anyone else is breeding this species
and would like to make up unrelated pairs could they please get in touch
with Laura Gardner at:-Leeds Castle, Maidstone, Kent ME 17IPL, England.

AN AMATEUR'S EXPERIENCE IN IMPORTING
HUMMINGBIRDS

by Mrs Wharton-Tigar
In September last year (1933) I accompanied my husband on a short
visit to Pernambuco, Brazil. This place is practically unexplored from an
avicultural point of view, so I was determined to try and bring home a
collection of rare birds. With this end in view, I made a hurried study of the
birds to be found in that part of Brazil, and in this I was greatly helped by an
article by a Mr Forbes, written in The Ibis in 1881, on the birds he saw in
Pernambuco when on a visit there.
Late in July I met Mr Seth-Smith and he had accepted my offer to obtain
and bring over 20 hummingbirds for the zoo. As I was returning in November
and my stay in Pernambuco would only last three weeks, I rather wondered
if I had been rash in making this offer!
&apos; We chose the Royal Holland Lloyd line to travel on, as it was the only
line we could find that would let us bring back birds and would undertake to
keep them warm. We sailed from Southampton on the SS Zeelandia on 28th
September, and early dawn of 12th October saw us nearing Pernambuco.
As we slowed down to await the pilot boat the air was delicious, clear and
not too warm; the port showing itself in a very long line of twinkling lights.
After some hours we slowly got alongside the quay, and as we got in we
could see local people with pineapples, highly painted gourds, and many
large cages of birds, Squirrel Monkeys, marmosets, and other small
mammals, which they try to sell to the passengers, mostly, of course, on the
home-coming boats. I noticed that the birds offered were not in good
condition, usually sticky, the manakins and hummingbirds especially.
The state is generally known by the name Pernambuco, but the town
there is really called Recife. It is divided into three parts by the River
Capiberibe, which winds in and out, separating the portions known as Recife,
Santo Antonio, and Boa Vista. Bridges across give the place a gay appearance
and in various parts of the town there are small public gardens which I
thought were quite cleverly laid out. They are planted with beautiful trees
of different sorts, some of the acacia family, resembling huge laburnums;
big bushes of oleanders (poisonous to birds, by the way) and bougainvillia

(really a creeper) throw rods 15-20 feet (approx. 4.5m-6m) long, covered
with the gayest flowers in bright crimson, purple and even orange. There
are hibiscus, with large single flowers in shades of pink, red and yellow, and
tropical lilies with scented white and rose flowers - these appeared to be
crinums - and palms, often in wonderful variety, tower up into the sky. Some
of these must be quite a 100 years old. The trees are mostly tall and branching,
bearing such fruits as the mango, the jack fruit, the jaboticaba, the caju, the
mangaba, the araga, the goiaba, the sapoti, and the abacate. All these, when
in flower, are a great attraction to the birds, especially the sugarbirds, quits,
and hummers, and when in fruit tanagers and thrushes abound.
The morning air is most exhilarating out there, and the people of the
country are very early risers; from 5am-7am&apos;is by far the nicest part of the
day, the temperature then being about 75*F (23.9*C). In the middle of the
day, in the houses, it rises to from 80*F - 85*F (26.7*C - 29.4*C), but the
welcome sea breeze prevents the heat from becoming oppressive. The houses
are built to withstand the great heat, with verandahs and plenty of windows
which are always open. We were there in the very dry season and the heat
was terrific, but I was surprised to find that I could get about with less
discomfort than over here during a hot spell.
When I arrived at the &apos;pension', which we had chosen especially because
it had a large garden, I found that our room was immediately opposite a
very large tree (a 'jambo' with pinkish fruits looking like small pink wax
pears and tasting like cotton wool dipped in sugar and water!). This was not
then in fruit, but was covered with masses of creamy white blossoms from
about 15ft (approx. 5.4m) up to a great height and circumference. As I
looked up I saw hundreds of bananaquits of several varieties, some very
tiny, others a little bigger, some very bright yellow, others duller (It seems
that the names bananaquit or quit used to be used for several different species ,
such as sugarbirds or honeycreepers, tanagers and grassquits. Ed.). I also
noticed several Yellow Tanagers Calliste flava (probably what is now called
the Burnished-buff Tangara cay ana flava. Ed.), this being a very common
bird in Pernambuco; and, besides seeing a number in this tree, I often heard
their sweet little song when sitting in the garden under the sapoti trees. These
latter were just ripening, their queer fruits rather like a bad pear.
The tree opposite my window was a great source of pleasure to me; at
5.00am next morning I awoke and looked out, and had a splendid view.
Birds were constantly backwards and forwards - including many varieties
of the blue tanagers, some a glorious powder blue, some grey, and some
nearly green. I never managed to buy any of the duller ones or of the glorious
bright blue ones that might have been something even better. I saw a lot of
lovely little yellow birds with orange red heads, which I know now were
Orange-headed Tanagers Thlypopsis sordida. I also frequently saw a

beautiful thrush with crimson sides, all sorts of doves, and many other birds
which were too far off to be distinguished.
I lost no time in going to the market at St Jose. This is a very disappointing
place for birds, but surprises do occur. The bird portion is small and close to
the sugar cane section. The birds are all together, usually in very large
cages. Among others were Pope Cardinals Paroaria dominicana in rough
condition, Saffron Finches Sicalis flaveola , the several grey Sporophila that
they call 'Patativas' and which are bought by Brazilians as song birds. Often
there are big cages of caciques: I saw some very bright yellow ones but did
not buy any as they are not popular in England. There were plenty of Brazilian
Hangnests Icterus icterus , which if caught wild are quite cheap, but if pale
coloured are hand-reared and command a high price.
Soon after I landed and made enquiries about bird collecting I was told
of a Swiss who was very keen on birds, and who, they told me, had reared
hummers from the nest. I lost no time in finding out where he lived. His
name is Mr Cordier and he lives with his charming Brazilian wife in a
bungalow where he has quite large aviaries, well equipped and thought out.
I arrived there on a Sunday afternoon and he took me round his aviaries at
once.
They certainly were a fine sight and I never had a greater thrill. He must
have had at least a hundred hummers, all in glorious condition: the 'Bizorro'
as they call it (probably the Reddish Hermit Phciethornis ruber , a tiny brown
thing no larger than a bumble bee), some of the larger wood hermits, and
jacobins with glistening white tails and wings, all of which had been in his
aviaries for months.
He showed me with pride a tiny Horned Sungem Heliactin cornuta which
nothing apparently would induce him to part with. He found a mate for it,
however, and I persuaded him to let me have the pair; but, alas, they both
died on almost the first night on the journey home, after the rough usage
they had on the quay and on the ship before I could get things straightened
out. Besides the hummers there was a glorious collection of manakins -
White-bearded Manacus manacus and the Red-headed Pipra rufocapilla ,
rare tanagers. Russet-crowned Crakes Laterallus viridis, water tyrants, and
even a swallow!
I was soon told that I could have none of these treasures as they were all
booked to go to Germany via Havre in a few days. I believe some of the
hummers were bought by Mr Ezra for the zoo. I felt crestfallen, but Mr
Cordier told me that more could be found and collected for me. I told him
what I wanted and he said he would find all he could, and he did. It was a
great disadvantage of course to have to bring over newly caught birds, and
under a week before I sailed for home most of my manakins, Hooded Tanager
Nemosia pileata and several others were still being hand-fed. What an

education it was to watch Mr Cordier do this. If the newly caught birds do
not start to feed very quickly he liberates them and they fly straight back to
the forests.
Besides Mr Cordier I went to a certain Joao da Malta, who had been
trained by Mr Cordier, and from him I got White-bellied Seedeaters
Sporophila leucoptera , the five hummers of a new species, the Stripe-breasted
Starthroat Heliomaster squamosa and several of the rarer birds I brought
over.
Around Pernambuco, in the surrounding towns, there are held on Sundays
various fairs. I managed to attend two of these and on each occasion I was
fortunate in finding something rare. I was in Brazil for three Sundays and
would have managed to attend several more fairs - feiras as they are called
over there, but could not, as my husband took a marked objection to standing
about in the blazing sun while I bargained with the locals. So I had to give
up the idea and we went to Boa Viagem instead, where surely there is the
most perfect sea bathing in the world.
Mr Cordier undertook to cage and pack all my birds, besides getting me
through the Brazilian Customs (no easy matter) and to buy me all the
necessary foods for the journey home. I had taken out well-made cages for
the birds to be brought home in, but on arrival I found that I could not bring
these in without paying an exorbitant duty, so they remained in board until
I left - I never opened them again until I arrived back in London. They
would also not allow me to land my supply of dried flies and ants' eggs and
would have destroyed them if influence had not been brought to bear! These
were also put in bond and I was allowed to reclaim them as I left, and they
proved very valuable for feeding the birds on the way back. They also
object to mealworms, so I left mine on board in cold storage, and was very
glad of them later. I should mention here that we came home on the same
steamer as we went on, the boat cruising down to Buenos Aires and back
during our stay in Pernambuco.
Another good way of picking up birds is to meet the Lloyd Braziliero
boats from Para and Manaus. I went on board several times, and on one
occasion I bought a pair of stilts Himantopus sp. from one of the sailors.
The poor birds were in a very bad condition, all crowded together in a tiny
basket. I also saw two fine Hyacinthine Macaws Anodorhynchus
hyacinthinus, but could not buy of course. I saw Sun Bitterns Eurypyga
helias and trumpeters Psophia sp., but I know very little about this type of
bird so I did not buy any. I just missed a very rare little monkey and fell in
love with 'Chico', a little Capuchin Monkey now at the zoo. How fond he
was of me. I well remember his joy on my appearance at the door of the
bird cabin. Not having seen him for several months, I am wondering what
my reception will be like when we meet again.

I shall never forget the day we left Pernambuco. After waiting on the
quay with the birds in crates from 10am until 7pm in the evening, we were
absolutely exhausted. All the large, roughly made crates were dumped on
board, and I was left to try and make Dutch stewards understand what I
wanted done with them. None of the bigger cages would fit in a cabin, so to
make matters worse, I had to take all the wicker cages out of the hummer
crates and carry them one by one to the cabin. The smaller cases with wire
fronts were all placed in a position so that the birds got no light or air. Blank
despair can only describe my feelings; add to this acute seasickness and you
will see how black things seemed. The ship had allotted to me a third-class
cabin in the worst part of the ship for my birds, but luckily other passengers
complained and I was moved to two outside cabins in a more secluded and
unused part of the ship. The heat was so great that within a minute of entering
the cabin everything I wore was as wet as if I had got into a bath.
I arranged the birds as best I could and went from them to my bed for
several days, wondering if I could manage to hold out, and to add to my
troubles the glass hummer bottles kept on breaking at such a rate that I
thought I should never manage to keep any hummers alive. I can only put
this down to the terrible heat as, I am glad to say, none cracked after Madeira,
so the situation was saved.
I was greatly assisted on board by a charming Dutch lady, Mrs Van
Eeghen, who offered to help and joined me at 6.30am and 4.30pm when we
fed the birds. At midday I also changed the hummers' food. It used to take
us two hours to do all the feeding twice a day, working hard. I followed out
Mr Cordier's instructions about feeding to the letter, and they were pretty
strenuous.
On the whole the losses I suffered were moderate considering the terrible
and very sudden changes in temperature. After Vigo it became very cold,
and owing to the determination of my kind friend, Mrs Van Eeghen, the
place was kept warm enough. She was a great help in managing the Dutch
engineer and the purser, and also in organising the preparation for landing
the birds at Southampton and tackling the stewards in their own language.
We packed everything as warmly as we could, stuck paper over cracks in
the crates, and hoped for the best. Overseer Bailey, of the zoo, came on
board at Southampton and we had an hour and a half on the tender and a
long train journey before depositing the birds safely in London. No losses
occurred,- however, and the hummers were hurried to the zoo, the other birds
to my home in Hampstead.
It may be of interest if I give below a list of some of the birds which I
finally managed to land in England.
The following are first importations alive, so far as is known: Stripe-

September 15th, Hancock House published the Hancock House
Encyclopedia of the Lories by Rosemary Low, an acknowledged expert on
these birds and a frequent contributor to the Avicultural Magazine.
The publisher offered the Avicultural Magazine the opportunity to publish
the following extracts to coincide with the publication. From the publishers
point of view it is, of course, a way of helping publicise this important new
title which is available only by direct mail order, while from the Society&apos;s
point of view, it provides the magazine with important material about a
group of birds which is of considerable interest to many members. So far as
1 am aware, the publication of extracts, from a newy published book is
something which has never been done before in this magazine. However, in
view of the interest in the subject matter, the author&apos;s atanding within the
Society and the avicultural community generally, and the need to find
sufficient material to publish in the magazine, I decided to go ahead.
The first of the extracts, on Bacterial Infections, is just one of some 91
lory-related topics which are covered and the extract on the Black-capped
Lory is the first of the individual species accounts. So as to remain as true
as possible to the book, I have retained, as far as possible, the general style
and North American spellings, but because of the smaller format of the
magazine, have been unable to retain the two columns of text. -Ed.

Bacterial infections are a major cause of death of captive lories. Species
of bacteria most likely to be responsible are those of the genera Salmonella
and Klebsiella , and also Escherichia coli. However, E. coli may be part of
the normal intestinal flora and is not necessarily pathogenic. The main
reasons why death from gram-negative bacterial infections is common in
lories is because they are fed a liquid diet which often has a high content of
simple sugars. In warm temperatures this is a perfect medium for the growth
of bacteria. This is why the liquid food should be changed twice daily or
even three times in temperatures over 35*C (95*F). Lory cages and aviaries
need cleaning more frequently than those of other parrot species. If this
task is neglected, harmful bacteria will proliferate.
In my experience, salmonellosis is the most serious disease from the
viewpoint of the lory keeper in a warm climate. Annually it will make itself
known in summer. Because affected birds seldom show abnormal behavior
until a few hours before death, treatment usually comes too late. If birds are
not inspected several times daily, nothing abnormal will be noticed and a
bird could be picked up dead. Although at least one avian pathologist of

note believes that lories which carry salmonellosis do not exist (i.e., exposed
birds are either noncarriers or die), this was not my experience. I recall the
sad case of a beautiful male red-flanked lorikeet. Two of his females and
most of his young had died. Repeated tests gave the result that he was
shedding Salmonella. The reluctant decision was made to euthanize him.
Poor breeding results, and deaths of adults and chicks, should always be
investigated by an avian veterinarian. There is a high possibility that gram-
negative bacteria are responsible. The cause could be poor nest hygiene. It
is not advisable to accept chicks for hand-rearing from other collections
because of the disease risk. However, a decade or more ago a breeder asked
me to hand-rear the chicks from his pair of blue-streaked lories, whose chicks
invariably died at a few days old. He brought me a newly hatched chick; it,
too, died soon after. The postmortem report read as follows:
This chick showed a very pale, mottled liver and some congestion
of the lungs. Culture from lungs, liver and intestine all produced a
heavy, pure growth of a haemolytic Streptococcus (apparently of
Group C, otherwise known as Streptococcus zooepidemicus ). There
is little doubt that the origin of the bacteria is the nest environment.
Contamination of the chicks just after hatching, or possibly of the
eggs prior to hatching, is the cause of the problem.
I impressed on the owner the need to clean and disinfect the nestbox. In
the next clutch both eggs hatched. I cannot recall whether I received them
just prior to hatching or as newly hatched chicks. This time both chicks
were successfully reared.
It must be realized that bacteria are found naturally in most living
organisms, internally and externally. The type depends upon the species.
The normal intestinal flora of parrots is made up predominantly of a group
known as gram positive, such as lactobacillus, staphylococcus and
streptococcus. These bacteria usually take several weeks to colonize the
tracts of newly hatched chicks and are passed to the chick by its parents or
other organisms with which it comes into contact. The natural intestinal
bacteria (or flora) aid in the digestion of food which the bird itself cannot
digest, and protect against the colonization of harmful bacteria such as those
mentioned above, and also Pseudomonas. It must be remembered that
treating bacterial infections with antibiotics and antifungal preparations also
results in the destruction of the 'friendly' microorganisms. In other words,
their use weakens the bird's immune system. This is why they should never
be given on a regular or prophylactic basis or given at a greater strength
than that recommended by a veterinarian.

The members of this genus are unmistakable: large, stocky lories with
longish, broad tails. All species have the wings green, and red predominates
in the body plumage. They are handsome birds. In immature plumage, in
most (or all?) species, the greater underwing coverts (the outermost feathers
only) are broadly tipped with black. This is confirmed in domicellus , lory
and chlorocercus. According to their plumage, Lorius can be divided into
two groups: (1) the black-capped species: purple-naped, black-capped,
purple-bellied, white-naped and yellow-bibbed; (2) the single species without
the black cap, the chattering (yellow-backed) lory.
These lories originate from New Guinea and surrounding islands,
Indonesia and the Solomon Islands. In aviculture, the chattering and the
black-capped are well known and cherished. One species, the purple-naped,
is rare. The yellow-bibbed was almost unknown until the 1980s, but its
numbers are increasing. The purple-bellied is almost unknown outside New
Guinea and the white-naped has never been in aviculture. The Lorius species
are exceptionally attractive aviary birds but their loud voices may deter some
people from keeping these otherwise desirable lories. They make excellent
pets, and some become good mimics. If kept singly they need plenty of
attention to compensate for the lack of a partner of their own kind. They are
highly intelligent and playful and will make use of every kind of swing or
toy provided. Unlike some lories, they need at least 20 to 30 percent solid
foods (fruits and vegetables and even a few sunflower seeds) in their diet, in
addition to nectar.
Black-capped Lory Lorius lory (Linnaeus 1758)
Native names: Fore, Korio; Gimi, Korio ; Daribi, Somu
Description: Forehead, crown and nape are black; the rest of the head is red
and a red band separates the nape from the mantle; in most birds the, middle
of the band is a bleached or washed-out shade of pink. The upper part of the
upper breast is also red. A broad collar of dark blue joins the same color on
the mantle and on the lower breast, extending to the underparts, under tail
coverts and thighs. The shade of blue is brighter, more violet, on the lower
abdomen, ventral area, under tail coverts and thighs. Rump and upper tail
coverts are crimson, the bases of the feathers being gray and green. The
wings are green with a bronze patch on the primary coverts. Underwing
coverts are red and there is a broad band of yellow across the underside of
the flight feathers. The tail is red above at the base, dark blue at the tip; the
underside is gray-tinged yellow. The beak is orange; the iris is orange with

a narrow inner ring of pale yellow, a narrow ring of black and a wide ring of
orange. The legs are black.
Length: 29-30 cm, nominate race; jobiensis and cyanuchen are slightly
larger and the other subspecies are smaller.
Weight: 230-250 g, nominate race; about 180-240 g in erythrothorax.
Immatures: These birds of the nominate race differ from adults in having
the dark blue of the upper breast extending higher up, as far as the throat in
some individuals. Up until the age of 18 months or so, the area between
throat and upper breast gradually loses the dark blue feathers. The bill is
brown on fledging, gradually becoming dark yellow with dark grey at the
base of the upper mandible. The iris is dark brown. An immature
erythrothorax looks rather different from the adult, as it has a complete
collar of dark blue, while adults of this subspecies have a half collar which
does not meet below the throat. By about ten months of age the dark blue
feathers of the throat are lost, so the collar is then incomplete, and remains
so. In some young the collar is narrow; in others it may be 2cm wide. The
beautiful iridescent violet-blue of the post-torqual band is notable. The
complete collar of dark blue is present in cyanuchen. In jobiensis , immature
birds have duller plumage with green feathers on the flanks. The blue band
which in adults extends from the lower breast to under the wings, is only
partly formed (Tiskens 1993). In erythrothorax , and almost certainly in all
subspecies, the lesser underwing coverts are blue toward the carpal edge of
the wing. The greater underwing coverts are very broadly tipped with black.
Sexual dimorphism: Plumage is the same in male and female but beak
shape usually differs slightly. The upper mandible is normally broader, and
more protruding, in the male; the female's beak therefore appears more
rounded and less elongated.
Subspecies: Seven or more subspecies are generally recognized, but only
six appear to be valid. Their identification has caused aviculturists confusion.
In the U.K. Trevor Buckell studied skins in several museums to assist
aviculturists in pairing together the correct races. He came to the conclusion
that salvadorii and viridicrissalis were synonymous with jobiensis , but later
had reason to believe that salvadorii was a valid form. L. 1. viridicrissalis
supposedly differs from salvadorii by the more blackish blue on the hindneck.
Forshaw (1989) describes the underwing coverts as mainly black with some
dark blue in males, and as dark blue in females.
The subspecies can be divided into two groups for ease of identification:
(1) those with red underwing coverts: lory, somu, and erythrothorax (the

latter sometimes known as the red- breasted lory); (2) those with black or
dark blue underwing coverts: cyanuchen, jobiensis (known as the Jobi lory)
and salvadorii (Salvadori's black-capped lory).
Within these groups, the subspecies can be recognized by noting the
following points.
1. In lory , the blue of the abdomen and upper breast extends over the
back, forming a continuous area; sornu is easily distinguished as it lacks any
blue on the nape or breast, these areas being entirely red; erythrothorax has
the abdomen blue, the breast red, and the blue of the collar extending slightly
and irregularly onto the upper breast. The demarcation between the red of
the breast and the blue of the abdomen is an almost straight line.
2. Although jobiensis agrees with erythrothorax in having the breast
and interscapular area red and the blue of the collar extending slightly on to
the upper breast, it differs from group one subspecies in having blue
underwing coverts and no yellow under the wings; cyanuchen differs from
jobiensis in lacking red on the nape. Thus there is only one red band, that on
the interscapular region, thus this is the only subspecies with no red on the
back of the head, as its name suggests ( cyanuchen means blue nape).
According to Buck ell. salvadorii differs from jobiensis in having the
abdomen black, with the odd green feather in some specimens (dark blue
abdomen in jobiensis ), in being smaller, and also in the shade of red, which
is not the rose red of jobiensis .

Peninsula. Its range meets that of somu in the Fly River area. The southern
New Guinea subspecies, L. 1. somu, is known from the Karimui Basin and
south of that area, from the mouth of the Purari River, from the Fly River
and from the Lake Kutubu area (Forshaw 1989). Coates (1985) gives its
range as the south side of the main ranges from the Ok Tedi area, Western
Province, to the Karimui area of the Chimbu Province.
2. L. /. jobiensis is restricted to the island of Japen (formerly called
Jobi) and the Mios Num Islands in Geelvink Bay, Irian Jaya. L. l.cyanuchen
is restricted to Biak and Supiori islands (see Gazetteer), Geelvink Bay, Irian
Jaya. L. 1. salvadorii comes from northern New Guinea, from Astrolabe
Bay through the lowlands westward to the Aitape area and, if viridicrissalis
is synonymized with salvadorii, even further westward, with a disjunct
distribution extending as far west as Mamberamo River.
Habits: This is principally a bird of lowland forests and, in New Guinea, is
uncommon above 1,000 m(3,280 ft.). It is seen in pairs or family groups;
larger numbers congregate to feed but do not stay together. In virgin forest,
where it occurs along with small flocks of green-naped lorikeets and dusky
lories, the latter two species are found consistently several hundred feet
higher (Diamond 1972). Beehler, Pratt and Zimmerman (1986) state that it
occurs in small parties, foraging in the canopy of forest and forest edge. It
usually flies at canopy level. Coates (1985) gives its habitat as primary
forest, forest edges, tall secondary growth and partly cleared areas, being
absent from monsoon forest, gallery forest and coconut plantations.
In 1991, Thomas Arndt searched for cyanuchen on Biak and reached the
conclusion that its population was small. He saw several black-caps of other
subspecies offered for sale in the market in Biak town, and one cyanuchen,
but a dealer told him that the latter was seldom caught (Arndt 1992). However,
John Tabak (pers. comm. 1995) bought 2 cyanuchen in Biak markets at
different times and stated: "They are readily available in the local markets,
being the most esteemed lory amongst Biak people on account of their
character and reputation for speaking ability. They are common household
pets. They and the sulphur-crested cockatoos are the main species of parrots
traded in Biak." He commented that cyanuchen is still fairly common in the
wild in northern Biak and on Supiori Island, which remain well forested,
but that he observed it less often than black-winged lories and Rosenberg's
lorikeets in January and February of 1995. However, it is not possible to
obtain a permit to export cyanuchen from Biak without the personal consent
of the national minister of forests.
Newman (pers. comm. 1994) observed erythrothorax in the Varirata
National Park, 48 km (30 miles) from Port Moresby. He saw groups of two
to four birds, plus a single specimen perched at the forest edge. Most

sightings were in the area of the park headquarters and car park. I had a
fleeting glimpse of three birds not far from the park entrance (coming from
Port Moresby) in November, 1994. It was midday, so few birds were in
evidence. Opened in October, 1973, Varirata is the first national park of
PNG. (It was dedicated to present and future generations, "for wise use,
education and understanding of the ways of nature.")
The black-cap is usually seen in flight, when it is conspicuous and noisy.
Coates (1985) describes its vocalizations as follows: "The flight call is an
oft-repeated variable loud musical whistled note, sometimes disyllabic or
trisyallabic and often given as pairs of upslurred notes, sometimes
interspersed with other notes. A variety of loud whistles and piercing squeaks
are given when perched."
Its repertoire can contain pleasant and varied phrases, at least among
captive birds; but there is considerable variation. Accounts by other
ornithologists differ. Beehler, Pratt and Zimmerman (1986) describe "a short
series of melodious whistles or squeals, more like the call of a wader (or
Golden Myna) than of a parrot: wheedle, wheedle. Song is a long series of
phrases, each of a few notes repeated over and over before beginning a new
phrase. Sometimes gives a monotonous series of identical notes suggesting
a goshawk."
Diamond (1972) has a different, perhaps slightly fanciful, but equally
accurate account: "The commonest vocalization consists of two identical
squeals in immediate succession, with a quality as of sleigh-bells when heard
in the distance; this double squeal cannot be confused with the voice of
other New Guinea parrots. In addition, a variety of high piercing squeaks
and loud whistles may be emitted, particularly when the birds are perched."
Diamond suggested that, judging by the trees frequented, it feeds
principally on flowers, secondarily on fruits. Others have recorded it feeding
on the climbing Freycinetia. Coates states that it feeds in the canopy, mainly
on pollen, nectar, flowers and fruits, also insects. Pollen and small insects
have been found in the stomachs of birds collected in the Weyland Mountains,
Irian Jaya.
Nesting: Little has been recorded. In the Markham Valley (west of the
Huon Peninsula) a pair was excavating a nest hollow in a dead tree at the
edge of a garden, in October. One egg in the British Museum (Natural
History) measures 27.0 x 22.0 mm (Harrison and Holyoak 1970). This is
quite small - but there is considerable variation in eggs laid by some females.
For example, three measured from one female erythrothorax at Palmitos
Park were 29.0 x 24.6mm, 30.0 x 24.1mm and 27.8 x 24.0mm. A second
female laid one which measured 30.5 x 26.8mm. One egg laid by a salvadorii
measured 31.4 x 25.5mm (van Dooren pers. comm. 1995).

Status/Conservation: Common to fairly common. The exception is
cyanuchen from Biak, whose small population is believed to be declining.
Due to its restricted habitat, this is the most vulnerable subspecies and
conservation measures should be instigated. No such measures are known
to be necessary for black-capped lories from other parts of the range. Some
trapping for trade occurs, but large importations of this species have not
occurred, presumably because it is not a flock species and tends to be wary.
As from 1987, importation from Indonesia into European Community
countries was prohibited.
Aviculture
Status: The subspecies lory and erythrothorax are well known; cyanuchen
is almost unknown, and the other subspecies have occasionally been
available.
Clutch size: Two
Incubation period: In the Canary Islands about 25 days, but as long as 27
days has been recorded for the first egg, also 26 days. For the second egg,
24 days has been recorded on several occasions. Paul Tiskens (pers. comm.
1994) found that in Germany eggs of erythrothorax hatched after 26 to 28
days and johiensis after 25 to 28 days (the difference presumably being due
to when the female started to incubate). One egg of a salvadorii hatched
after 25 days (van Dooren pers. comm. 1995)

Newly hatched chick: Weight, 9g; covered in long, white down, longest on
the back and flanks; the down on the forehead and crown is grey; feet are
pink with dark gray "heels" and the toes have black nails. The beak is dark
brown.
Chick development: 3 to 6 days, feet turning gray; day 8, down feather
tracts visible under skin of wings and body; day 9, gray head down only just
discernible; days 10 to 13, ears opening; day 11, eyes slitting; day 13, eyes
half open; day 16, gray second down erupting on wings and breast; day 19,
second down erupting all over; day 23, first contour feathers erupting on
head, breast and scapulars, red "blush" on cheeks (feathers developing under
skin); day 28, head and underparts half feathered; day 50, fully feathered,
beak dark brown. Chicks are ringed with 8.5 mm rings between 14 and 17
days; Tiskens (pers. comm. 1994) ringed chicks with 8 mm rings at 16 to 18
days.
Chick growth: Records the weights of two parent-reared chicks from
different pairs at Palmitos Park. No. 1 hatched on 28/1/95 and No. 2, on 12/
3/95. Both were the only chicks in the nest The rearing food consisted of
a mixture of Nekton-Lori., Milupa baby cereal and honey, with the addition
of half a fruit twice daily, usually apple, pear or banana. These weights are
contrasted with approximate weights of two parent-reared jobiensis in the
collection of Andrea and Paul Tiskens in Germany (chicks No. 3 and No. 4)
and one parent-reared salvadorii belonging to G. van Dooren in the
Netherlands (chick No. 5).
Age at independence of hand-reared young: Great variation recorded by
author, from only 44 days in a single reared alone to 68 days in two reared
together; most are feeding on their own before the age of seven weeks but
may still require some food from the spoon.
Young in nest: In the Canary Islands, average 69 days; but between 61 and
77 days recorded. The shorter periods generally occurred during the warmest
months. In the U.K., 65 to 70 days, but only 57 days for one particular pair
recorded by Trevor Buckell,

General: The black-capped is popular among those who are able to keep
the larger and noisier lories. It has color and character and is one of my own
favorites. Its complex behavior and vocalizations make it a most interesting
and amusing bird in the aviary. Tame birds are excellent pets and often
become accomplished mimics and whistlers. Perhaps because of its scientific
name (it was the first lory to be described) it somehow stands almost as a
symbol for the whole family of lories. To me, this is the quintessential lory,
possessing all the attributes which give this group so much appeal. Tiskens
and Tiskens (1993) agree: "The Black-cap is one of the most beautiful and
interesting of the lories, and ideally should not be missing from any collection
of lories." However, they warn: "If you still have 'beloved' neighbors, then
one should not wish for this lory since its call can be loud and shrill."
Despite this, black-caps are quite often kept as pets. Like most Lorius
species, they can become very talented mimics of the human voice. They
have such endearing mannerisms as to be irresistible as a pet to the true lory
lover. However, he or she must be prepared for the frequent cleaning in the
vicinity of the cage in return for the joy of having a black-cap share his or
her life.
From the late 1970s, importations of black-caps gradually became fewer;
not enough were bred to maintain numbers and by the mid-1980s it was
considered to be one of the rarer species. Prices rose. This, of course, added
to its desirability, and more interest was shown in breeding it. Its numbers
have since grown steadily.
In the breeding centre at Palmitos Park the lories are housed in a large,
high, airy, enclosed building, each pair confined to a suspended cage 2m (6
ft. 6in) long. They were set up for breeding at the end of 1989. Between
January, 1990, and March, 1994, 84 eggs were laid by several females of
the subspecies erythrothorax and by one nominate lory . February and March
are the most likely egg-laying months on Gran Canaria. During the period
mentioned above, the number of eggs laid for each month was as follows:

Forty-one of these eggs produced chicks of ringing age or older. Fertility
was high, and most chick losses occurred in the few days after hatching.
Oblong or L-shaped nestboxes are attached to the outside of the cage, for
ease of inspection. Females tend to be secretive about having eggs and will
quietly leave the nestbox when someone is in the vicinity. Unless the nest is
checked daily when laying is suspected, the laying dates may be unknown.
I inspect the nest about once a week during the incubation period, and daily
after the chicks hatch. With the exception of one female who was more
aggressive, females would leave quietly when I opened the door, and return
quickly. They ceased to stay in the box during the day when the young were

about three weeks old, but usually came to watch when I was weighing
chicks. They accepted the routine without any fuss, unlike many lories with
chicks. The black-caps are normally excellent parents. One female killed
her first youngster on the day it hatched, but thereafter reared her young
successfully. Occasionally two chicks hatch but, with the pairs in my care,
more clutches produced only a single chick.
Many young were left with their parents for several months after fledging.
On one occasion a single youngster remained in the cage for the entire rearing
period of the young one from the following clutch; the two were eventually
removed from the cage at the same time. I remember the day on which the
chick from the second nest hatched. Oddly, the whole family was in the
nestbox; the young one must have been curious about the new arrival! In

Their diet consisted of a mixture of Nekton-Lori and Milupa baby cereal
with some honey added. Fruit was offered once or twice daily. Pear and
banana at the correct stage of ripeness (not hard, but not overripe) and guavas
are favored; apple, cactus fruits, loquats and other fruits in season are readily
accepted. I occasionally gave them a few grains of dry sunflower seed.
When offered branches of casuarina with small fruits (cones), the seeds
were removed first, and then the entire branch was destroyed.
Courtship behavior was difficult to observe in the breeding pairs, except
for the preliminary phase. This consists of rapid bobbing up and down with
the feet anchored to the perch, and swaying from side to side. I have also

observed males briefly holding open the wings to show the striking yellow
area on the primaries. The behavior of my hand-reared and somewhat
imprinted male, when he attempts to copulate with my hand, is described
here, but I am not certain if this is entirely typical. After the preliminary
phase described, he makes a rhythmic squeaky sound, sometimes blowing
(roughly equivalent to hissing in Trichoglossus). This is followed by a drawn-

Experiences of breeders with other subspecies are of interest. In Germany,
Andrea and Paul Tiskens had a female jobiensis who was paired with a male
of the nominate race. The resulting young had the breast patch clearly defined
as in erythrothorax. Finally, in 1991, they were able to obtain a male
jobiensis. The other male was removed from earshot - but it was several
months before the female would tolerate the new male or allow him near the
nestbox. Mating was first observed in January, 1992. The female laid on
March 20 and 24, but both eggs were infertile. She laid two fertile eggs in
June. The first hatched on July I or 2 and the second, on July 4. The young
left the nest for a short time on September 1, and by September 12 were
spending most of the day out of the nest (Tiskens and Tiskens 1993).

HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS OF THE WORLD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999717263157895" page_id="56285874"  page_num="84" year="" vol="">
The arrival of Volume 4 of the Handbook of the Birds of the World marks
completion of a third of this impressive work. Like its predecessors, it is in
every sense a heavyweight - nearly 700 pages measuring 310 x 240 mm, 70
colour plates illustrating hundreds of birds, more than 250 colour
photographs, 850 distribution maps and over 7,000 bibliographical
references. Purchasers will need a bookcase or bookshelf of some substance
for this volume weighs nearly 4kg. Of course, if you pay more than #100
for a book of this kind you are entitled to expect quality - and this is precisely
what has been provided in successive volumes. Although the various
contributing Editors are drawn from countries around the world, the editorial
team is based in Barcelona where the volumes are produced, and one assumes
there is close liaison between Lynx Edicions staff and the production people
which almost certainly accounts for the impeccable nature of the finished
product. Certainly, as well as looking good the book has a comforting feel
to it and one cannot fail to appreciate the unmistakable aura of excellence
which is reflected in practically every aspect - from paper quality and colour
reproduction to printing and binding. Even the dust wrapper has a suggestion
of permanence about it!
Although all of the first four volumes have been universally welcomed
by ornithologists, many aviculturists will probably have been less interested
in the first three which covered Ostriches to Auks. Volume 4 marks the start
of a series of nine volumes dealing with many families to which bird keepers
are more likely to relate.
Just six familes are included in the present volume - Sandgrouse, Pigeons
and Doves, Cockatoos, Parrots, Touracos, and Cuckoos - in itself a clear
indication of the comprehensive treatment which typifies the series so far.
Arrangements are exactly as in the first three volumes - lengthy introductions
to each family covering morphological aspects, habitat, general habits, voice,
food and feeding, breeding, movements, relationship with man, status and
conservation.
Species text is concise, up to date and - although I cannot claim to have
read all of the million or so words that lie between the covers - accurate.
Putting these volumes to practical use I have found them extremely useful,
although I was blown slightly off-course when attempting to sort out some
of the races of the Zebra Dove Geopelia striata , to find that G. s. placida is
now given species status as the Peaceful Dove G. placida - one of a number
of classification changes.
The colour plates are not, shall we say, Thorburn or Bateman-type works

of art with birds depicted against beautifully drawn landscapes. But they
are accurate and well drawn, albeit one or two having a look of museum
specimens about them. However, as an aid to identification of species and
distinctive races they are excellent.
The standard of photographs reproduced in all four volumes has been
consistently brilliant. All are of a technically high standard and I appreciate
the considerable number which depict birds engaged in specific activities. I
particularly like a charming picture of a tightly-packed line of Scaled Doves
Scardafella squammata soaking up the early morning rays of the sun on a
chilly morning. Another to take my eye is a Buff on's Touraco Tauraco
persa buffoni attempting to intimidate the photographer by means of a
spectacular threat display. There are many such illustrations and I am sure
anyone who picks up a copy of this volume, or indeed any of those previously
published, will recognise their high quality. This is an aspect of the book
which should not be ignored - it is a pleasure to handle, either as a valuable
reference or simply to leaf through the pages.
While the first three volumes generated what can only be described as
'rave' reviews in many of the world's most prestigious scientific journals,
one or two reviewers - presumably having exhausted their stock of
superlatives have made carping observations about alleged minor
shortcomings in this volume. A pity. For while one or two pinprick errors
may reveal themselves to a meticulous proof reader they do not detract from
what is destined to be a publishing triumph.
Handbook of the Birds of the World is published by Lynx Edicions (in
association with BirdLife International) Passeig de Gracia, 12, 08007 -

obviously offers much more space than any review or brochure. By visiting

MESSAGES FROM AN OWL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986180625" page_id="56285875"  page_num="85" year="" vol="">
Max Terman is a professor of biology at a small college in a Kansas country
town. One day in 1988 he was asked to collect an apparently abandoned
owlet - 'a squawking ball of grimy cotton with a gaping black beak'.
'Stripey ' as the Great Homed Owl was to be called, became a research subject
for the ecology and animal behaviour students. But the owl was not to be confined
to a cage. Three months after she was found she was released with a transmitter
on her leg. Throughout her life - or at least for the eight years documented in
Messages from an Owl - 'Stripey's' behaviour and movements were monitored.

Max Terman's narrative is a highly readable and informative account of
the relationship he developed with the owl over the years. The detail is
remarkable, providing not only an insight into the life of an individual owl
but discovering aspects of owl behaviour which would have been difficult
with a truly wild owl.
What was interesting was the fact that 'Stripey' reacted to other humans,
but not to the author, as though they represented danger. One day, for example,
when she was nearly two years old, she was sitting in a tree, refusing to
move, when the author approached and tried to coax her down. But when
two pheasant hunters appeared, she took off at once and flew half a mile.
'This made his (sex unknown at that time) relationship with me all the more
mysterious' wrote Terman.
He wanted to know whether a hand-reared owl could become truly wild
- find a mate and rear young. When 'Stripey' was three years old she found
a mate. When she was almost exactly five years old, they hatched their first
two chicks.
In this book Max Terman raises an interesting issue from the perspective
of one who observed over a long period exactly what happened to a released
owl which, incidentally, he fed at intervals for two years or more. He wrote:
'The more wildlife ecologists learn about behavioral development in an
individual, the more we realize that releasing naive, captive-reared animals
to the wild is not the way to repopulate an area. If there is a surplus of such
essentials as good nesting and escape cover, food, and water, natural
populations will expand on their own. It is only as a last resort (no natural
populations) that planted animals from captive breeding should be used.
Planted animals simply compete with other animals already there. Ignorant
of how to behave in the wild, set loose in a strange place, they rapidly die of
starvation or fall prey to local predators... If I learned anything from 'Stripey',
it was that if animals are to be released, they must first be trained to live in
the wild - they cannot survive automatically.'
At the conclusion of the book Max Terman wrote: 'Despite being reared
by humans, 'Stripey', has still retained her true, identity, reproducing three
times. Her behaviour has been both complex and simple, wondrous and
perplexing. While I did not find the imprint of a man in an owl, I did discover
something greater in me.'
The real value of this book lies in its clever combination of feeling and
precise scientific observation. If it had been only the latter, it might have
been dull.

THE BIRD COLLECTORS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999216" page_id="56285877"  page_num="87" year="" vol="">
In the early days of collecting curios, bird skins might have seemed
preadapted for this purpose. Plumage colour, texture and patterns make
them desirable objects. The thin skin, once stripped from the flesh held the
feathers in place as a unit, and then it was easily dried, as were head and
legs. Skins were light and compact for packing, and if later reshaped by a
taxidermist the feathers helped disguise any imperfections.
When travellers and explorers began to visit new countries inevitably
the brighter bird skins and feathers were among the trophies that they brought
back. These became not merely curiosities but decorations, for clothing
and ornaments, and, as mounted exhibits, part of the furnishing of great
houses and institutions. The demand generated an extensive trade. Massive
collections began as an expression of power or wealth but the need to identify
and arrange these did much to encourage the new scientific classifications,
which in turn gave rise to a need for specimens from all over the world, and
a justification for the great private collections and those of national museums
attempting to become as comprehensive as possible.
All this could only be achieved through the long-term efforts of a huge
number of collectors, people of all kinds, and of varied occupations and
professions, through a period of about two and a half centuries. Barbara
and Richard Meams have attempted to provide an overview of such collecting
within the confines of a single volume, although to fully cover the whole
would probably require a multi-volume series. It is a very impressive
compilation, packed with details, and with interesting and entertaining asides.
Most of the people involved left written records of their work, and to
cope with the enormous volume of material the authors have produced a
text that systematically but briefly examines collecting and its aspects; the
early explorations and trade; the array of people who collected including
amateurs from other professions - army, medical and religious; women; and
professional collectors (seemingly all male). They survey the accumulators
of large collections anf finally try to deal with the advent of a change of
outlook involving ideas of protection and conservation and the need to
reconcile these with the justification for collections and the continuation of
collecting.
A great number of people are included, mostly with lively biographical
summaries, but these are often brief and even so the authors are forced to
use a limited selection of what are seen as typical examples. They also
admit to an 'Anglo-centric' bias, which nevertheless still leaves them with
an overcrowded stage. They include some tabulation of 19th century museum
ornithologists, early ornithologically important voyages, and significant
private collections- and some useful bibliographies. The book is illustrated
with photographs and prints of some of the characters involved , sometimes

POULTRY FOR ANYONE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992236035714286" page_id="56285878"  page_num="88" year="" vol="">
Many aviculturists find space in their collections for poultry - particularly
some of the more ornamental breeds of bantams. Recently published Poultry
for Anyone by Victoria Roberts is likely to find favour with experienced
poultry hands as well as mere beginners. Why? Because its author is better
qualified than most to compile such a work. She is not only an excellent
writer but has much practical experience of her subject having once run an
enterprise which not only tried to conserve all the old breeds but also bred
them and eventually had 150 varieties on display to the public. Victoria has
also served for many years on the council of the Poultry Club of Great Britain
and has recently edited the British Poultry Standards. At present she is
training to be a vet.
In this book she approaches her subject with almost missionary zeal,
writing with great enthusiasm and a healthy leavening of humour. Thus, on
the subject of the male Quail Barbu d'Anvers bantam: 'They have a habit
of attacking anything and everything in sight... they are so quick on their
feet that they usually come off best when attacking large fowl, rather like
David and Goliath'. Elsewhere she reminds us that it was the late Herbert
Whitley, founder of Paignton Zoo and a long-standing member of the
Avicultural Society, who, '...obsessed with blue birds...perfected both
standard and bantam blue Minorcas'.
Well crafted descriptions of 44 breeds detail their history, plumage,
character, utility and any special requirements in terms of husbandry. There
are also four short but useful appendices including a remarkable one of just
four pages which succeeds in instilling into even the veriest beginner just
about everything they needed to know in order to make a successful start with
poultry. Such informative brevity is a rare gift among authors of books of this
kind! Complementing the text are 90 specially commissioned photographs
by Michael Corrigan which also reach a high standard of excellence.

The book's foreword has been contributed by no less a poultry keeper
than Her Grace, The Duchess of Devonshire who reveals a lifelong interest
in the subject (continued to this day) and tells readers she was '...brought up
with hens' and would hate to be without them. Her three sisters also kept
poultry and one, Pam was responsible for importing the magnificently named
Appeezeller Spitzhauben into this country from Switzerland. Now there's
a breed name to roll around your tongue. Imagine offering your neighbour
some of their surplus eggs: 'Oh yes',you could say, loftily, 'try half-a-dozen
of these - they're from the Appenzeller Spitzhaubens, you know'. In terms
of one-upmanship, it beats the output of a pen of Rhode Island Reds any day
of the week.

<bodyText confidence="0.959286904761905" page_id="56285879"  page_num="89" year="" vol="">
Red-tails in Love is a wonderful combination of a naturalist's diary, a
mystery and a (somewhat unconventional) love story. The book describes
the adventures of 'Pale Male' and his succession of mates (the Red-tailed
Hawks of the title), but this is no anthropomorphic fantasy. Continuing a
long tradition of naturalists who observe and record events in their local
environment in exquisite detail, Marie Winn describes the daily triumphs
and tragedies of life in New York's Central Park. One of the main themes of
the book is the close co-existence of wildness and city, and it provides a
great insight into life in New York. Comparisons are drawn throughout
between Thoreau's 19th century descriptions of nature in the wilderness at
Walden Pond, and the sometimes desperate existence of the birds and animals
that manage to thrive in the heart of a 20th century city. No-one reading this
book can fail to be moved and excited by the story of the Red-tailed Hawks'
persistence and ingenuity, as over a period of years they successfully raise
several broods, converting many people to hawk-watching as they do so.
The book is full of interesting and surprising facts, and the excellent and
evocative descriptions of the characters involved in the story, both human
and bird, make for a compelling read.

PHILIPPINE COCKATOO: THE LAST CHANCE?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977153214285714" page_id="56285880"  page_num="90" year="" vol="">
A Frenchman, Marc Boussekey, has been instrumental in developing a
conservation programme for the Philippine Cockatoo. For nearly a decade
he has been visiting the Philippines and, in particular, the island of Palawan.
This was thought to be the last stronghold of the cockatoo and is the only
island where it occurs in significant numbers and where much forest is still
intact. Palawan measures 400km x 40km (approx. 248ml x 25ml), and
remains relatively untouched by tourism and development.
Philippine Cockatoo: The Last Chancel tells the story of his conservation
work there and of the discovery of a small population of cockatoos on the
uninhabited island of Rasa, off the east coast of Palawan. The video shows
wonderful film of them flying at dusk to roost in the mangroves. On Palawan
they are seen at night roosting in the wind-blown coconut palms (There is
also a brief shot of a Great-billed Parrot.). One can see interesting footage
of a pair at its nest, and feeding two chicks inside. Chick growth has been
monitored in a few nests. The weight of a chick at one month was recorded
as 300g. The breeding season starts in February or March and the young
leave the nest in the middle of the rainy season.
The population of this small cockatoo, found only in the Philippines,
has been reduced to between 1,000 and 3,000 birds. Habitat destruction is
the main reason for its decline but it has also been trapped for the pet trade
(local and international) and, in the past, killed as a pest because it was
considered to be a rice 'pirate'. Today its numbers are too low for it to do
much damage in the rice paddies. But, despite its protected status, it continues
to be trapped. The video shows a pet shop owner removing a cockatoo
when it is realised that interest is being shown in this illegally held bird.
The conservation programme, spear-headed by Marc Boussekey, is vital
for its survival. For more information, to make a donation towards the
project or to obtain the English version of the video, write to Marc Boussekey,

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

<bodyText confidence="0.990230075" page_id="56285881"  page_num="91" year="" vol="">
When I lived in Hong Kong from 1989 to 1995 I travelled a great deal
around the Asia Pacific region, including a few short visits to Australia and
1 also visited Africa, and was frequently able to study muni as and mannikins
in the wild. My book on the genus was a direct result of this. But birds were
essentially a secondary part of my life, since I also had a job to do. Since
retiring from business and moving to Venezuela, I am now a full-time
ornithologist. But munias and mannikins are almost a thing of the past. I
say almost, because we do have thriving feral populations of both the Tri
coloured Munia Lonchura Malacca, and the Java Sparrow L oryzivora in
the rice-growing country of Acarigua. I actually have four of the former in
my aviary. I'm hoping to be able to get in some field study of both in
August.
I was delighted to receive a letter from Dr Robert Payne of the Museum
of Zoology in Michigan, and learn that he is engaged in a comprehensive
study of genetic relationships among estrildids, especially munias and
mannikins. Using the complex and very expensive process known
mitachondrial DNA, or mita-DNA, Dr Payne is working out the relationships
of the various species. This is truly monumental, and the results will be
invaluable - not to say enlightening- to all who are in the least interested in
estrildid finches.
While the laboratory work may well be complex, costly and time
consuming, the aquisition of the raw material for the research is the very
opposite. All the scientists need are two fresh feathers from a bird. There is
usually enough flesh and blood attached to the root of a newly dropped or
pulled feather (even though you'd not see it with the naked eye) for them to
be able to analyse the DNA of the bird it came from. There is a problem of
course, and that is actually getting feathers. Which brings me to the purpose
of this letter. Dr Payne wrote to me to see whether I could help in getting
feathers for him to analyse. I will of course be sending feathers from our
two &apos;Venezuelan' munias, but these will hardly contribute anything new.
What are needed are feathers from all those species that come from New
Guinea and the far flung Indonesian islands, and parts of Africa, birds that
can be found in the aviaries of many members of the Avicultural Society.
And this presents an opportunity for aviculturists to make a truly significant
and meaningful contribution to scientific knowledge that has never been
greater.
This letter then is to appeal to all keepers of scarce and unusual waxbills,
munias and mannikins to please collect some feathers, and send them direct
to Dr Payne in the United States. Please don't ignore this because you think
somebody else will act. From experience, I know that far fewer people will

respond than one might imagine. I would be most grateful and genuinely
thrilled, if British aviculture would really make a mark for itself. Here's
what you should do.
Firstly, be absolutely sure to keep feathers accurately identified. Any
that are even slightly doubtful in origin must be discarded. My suggestion
is to use those very small plastic bags that can be used for keeping buttons
and other small bric-a-brac in. Place the feathers in a bag and label it with
the species' name. Please, never put feathers from different species together.
Birds kept in cages can be relied upon to drop feathers regularly. However,
birds that are in aviaries are a different matter. If you are catching up your
birds to bring them indoors for the winter, there's every chance they'll drop
a feather or two in the net. Great! Just be sure of the origin of those feathers,
and pop them into a bag, and write the species' name on it at once.
The best feathers of all are those pulled from the bird. But, only consider
this if you have experience and know what you&apos;re doing. If so, then only
two feathers from the secondaries, or the tail is enough. Please do not even
think of doing it with birds that are breeding or in any other way are in
special care. If you have the misfortune to have a bird die, then you'll be
able to pull a few feathers with equanimity, the knowledge that- they will
contribute to an important research project could be a small consolation for
the loss.
Send the feathers in an ordinary envelope to: - Robert B. Payne, Curator
of Birds and Professor of Zoology, 3019 Museum of Zoology, 1109 Geddes
Avenue, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1079, USA.
If the envelope is bulky enough become a package, you should identify
the contents on the customs label as, 'Bird feathers for scientific study.
Absolutely inert and sterile. No commercial value at all'. If you feel happier
contacting Dr Payne for mailing instructions, you can get in touch with him
by fax ore-mail as follows: -Fax: 734-763-4080/E-mail:rbpayne@umich.edu
I'm certain that Dr Payne will acknowledge all contributions. Please do
remember this letter when your birds are moulting. Thank you very much
indeed. With very best wishes.

In the Zoological Society of San Diego Annual Report , Dr James M.
Dolan, Director of Collections, reports that during 1997 the park's bird
department hatched the first Southern Bald Ibis Gervnticus calvus to be
bred in the Northern Hemisphere. Seven California&apos;Condor Gymnogyps
californianus chicks were hatched, bringing the total number hatched there
to 59. Other notable breedings included five Pink backed Pelicans Pelicanus
rufescens , five species of hornbills - the Red-knobbed Acems cassidix,
Wrinkled A. corrugatus , Papuan A. plicatus , Black Anthracoceros malayanus
and Abyssinian Ground Hornbill Rucorvus abyssinkus , two Asian Woolly-
necked Storks Ciconia episcopus and one RuppelPs Griffon Vulture Gyps
rueppellii.
In December a Harpy Eagle Harpia harpyja was hatched in the zoo's
bird department. Also hatched in 1997 were three Micronesian Kingfishers
Halcyon cinnamomina , a species now extinct in the wild, whose captive
population hovers around 50. For the second year five Empress of Germany's

EARLY NEWS FROM LORO PARQUE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995972321428571" page_id="56285884"  page_num="94" year="" vol="">
The Pesquet's Parrot Psittrichas fulgidus hatched last December at Loro
Parque, the breeding of which was the subject of an article in the previous
issue {Avicultural Magazine , 104, 1:14-16), by mid-March could be seen
sitting at the entrance to its palm-log nest hole fully feathered and almost
ready to fledge. Forty-four species had produced young by then, and others
were laying or incubating eggs.
Three young Red and Blue Lories Eos histrio had been hatched, adding
to the total of more than 20 chicks which have been reared successfully
during the past three years. The Mount Apo Lorikeets Trichoglossus
johnstoniae had produced a single chick and the hope was that they would
improve on their yearly average of rearing two or three young. The Musk
Lorikeets Glossopsitta concinna had reared two young.
A new pair of Moluccan Cockatoos Cacatua moluccensis had raised
their own two chicks, which means that Loro Parque now has two pairs of
this species which rear their own young, as well as two pairs whose young
need to be hand-reared. Four young Leadbeater's Cockatoos C. leadbeateri
were already independent, and four females reared in 1994 had just been
paired with males and two were already incubating eggs. As stated in the
article about fig parrots earlier in this issue, Edwards' Fig Parrot
Psittaculirostris edwardsii is among the more difficult species to keep and
breed, therefore it is good to report that two chicks had been hatched. Two
pairs of Green-winged King Parrots Alisterus chloropterus moszkowskii had
produced four young.
The Pyrrhura conures had got off to a very good start, with four species
already having produced 20 young. A pair of a fifth species, Hoffmann's
Conure P hoffmanni , was incubating five eggs. Two Short-tailed Parrots
Graydidascalus brachyurus and three Pileated Parrots Pionopsitto pileata
have been added to the collection.

MORE ABOUT VETS AT THE NATIONAL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.980683088235294" page_id="56285886"  page_num="96" year="" vol="">
The National Exhibition of Cage and Aviary Birds, commonly called
the National Cagebird Show, or quite simply 'the National' has been held
annually for over 50 vears but it is only relatively recently that the veterinary
profession became actively involved. From 1986-1989 two veterinary
surgeons, Professor John E. Cooper FRCVS and Dr Francis Scullion
MRCVS, donated their time and services to the three-day show and, working
closely with the official inspection commitee, helped to ensure that birds on
display or being offered for sale were properly housed, watered and fed
and, when necessary, provided with first aid and veterinary care.
In 1990 veterinary students participated for the first time. Four
undergraduates - from Bristol, Glasgow and Liverpool veterinary schools -
attended and, in addition to assisting in the routine veterinary work, carried
out observational studies on the health and welfare of birds on display. This
exercise proved very popular and as a result undergraduate involvement is
now a standard feature of the show. Details are sent out to all the British
veterinary schools in the autumn and the many applications to participate
are assessed in November. Competition is keen and unfortunately only a
small number of those applying can be accepted.
In 1995 there was a further innovation when invitations were extended
to postgraduate students on the Royal Veterinary College/Institute of Zoology
MSc in Wild Animal Health. These people are able to play a particularly
valuable part at the show since they are qualified veterinary surgeons and
thus can accept more responsibility. In particular, they assist in the work of
the inspection committee and in following up problems relating to the welfare
of birds that are offered for sale on trade stands.
The involvement of undergraduates and postgraduates at this large and
prestigious exhibition each year continues to prove very successful and
enables students with an interest in birds not only to help but also to learn.
It provides a unique opportunity for closer links to be formed between the
veterinary profession and aviculturists, the results of which can only be
beneficial in terms of the health and welfare of birds.

The White-bellied Sunbird Nectarinia talatala measures 10.5cm - 11cm
(approx. 4&apos;A in) long. The male has a bottle-green head and breast and a
white belly. The female is very similar to females of other sunbird species,
being uniformly dull brown above and off-white below with indistinct
streaking. The immature resembles the female.

Even though sunbirds are popular aviary subjects, especially the White-
bellied here in South Africa, few breeding records exist, yet it is the
commonest sunbird in southern Africa. We are aware that the White-bellied
Sunbird breeds between July-February, particularly during the months of
September-October, and that it lays 2-3 eggs which are variable in colour
and markings and are incubated by the female alone for 13 days. We also
know that the nestling period lasts 14-15 days.

Sunbird's nest in shorts hanging on rotary dryer
In most cases the nest is built in the leafiness of branches or branch-ends
where the chaffy bulks merge into the clustered leaf masses and make it less
visible from the outside. Other recorded sites include bushes at the side of
streams, in trees at the edge of dongas (dry watercourses), with individual
records of nests in a cactus plant, against a leaf, and in a thistle which had
previously held the nest of a mouse. Unusual sites for other species have
included the Olive Sunbird N. olivacea using the old nest of a pair of Thick-
billed Weavers Amblyospiza albifrons and the Lesser Double-collared
Sunbird N. chalybea using the nest of a pair of Karoo Prinias Prinia maculosa.
Peter Craig-Cooper and I were greatly fascinated by what we saw when
we were invited to photograph a most unusual nest site of a White-bellied
Sunbird in a garden in Queensburgh, a suburb of Durban. Standing in the
centre of the lawn was a rotary clothes dryer and pegged to one of the lines
were a few items of clothing which had been left on the dryer for three days
while the occupants of the house were away. On their return they were
surprised to see a bird entering and leaving a nest in the turned-up leg of a

paper, poultry feathers, dried leaves and spider cocoons incorporated into
the 'tail' of the nest which hung below the nest chamber. As there were no
trees in the vicinity to provide shade of any sort throughout the day, a towel
was draped over the shorts in the hope of lessening the penetration of the
sun's rays, and was done without disturbing the sitting bird.
Unfortunately, we were not present when the fledglings left the nest.

Whipsnade started keeping flamingos in 1947, when a small flock of
Greater Flamingos Phoenicopterus ruber roseus was introduced into the
park. These were joined in 1954 by the first Rosy Flamingos P. r. ruber and
in 1956 by Chilean Flamingos P. chilensis. Although all three went on to
breed, the decision was made in the mid-1980s to focus purely on the Rosy
Flamingo. It was not until 1971 that the first Rosy Flamingos hatched at
Whipsnade, since when a total of 116 have been hatched, with the peak year
being 1982, when 12 hatched. Up until 1993 the number hatched each year
varied from one to 12. Only in one year, 1972, were no flamingos hatched.
Missing one year was not of too great a concern. Recently, however, we
started to get concerned when they went for more than one year without
hatching any young. The vagaries of the British weather were used as an
excuse, as well as the fact that eggs were lost, probably to vermin and, there
was the feeling that disturbances at night were causing some birds to desert.
After the third year without any hatching it was decided that some action
was required to try to resolve the situation.
It was difficult to pinpoint any one factor that could have been preventing
them from breeding successfully. The area had not changed in many years,
the management protocol was the same and the colony size was still
reasonable, numbering over 40 birds. It is known that the population is
ageing with half of the birds being aged 25 years or older, but this should
not have been significant either. It was therefore decided to take action on
all areas of the management of the birds. The pond was drained and cleaned
and the nesting area was enlarged and new soil was brought in. New plants
were positioned to provide better screening of the nesting area and some
fence panels added to provide extra security behind the site. More waterfowl
were added to the pond in the hope that their efforts to breed might help
stimulate the flamingos and a change in diet was also made to a different
commercially prepared flamingo pellet. The final action taken was one of
timing. The colony is confined in a shed during the winter to prevent
problems with frostbite or through birds becoming trapped in the frozen
pond. There is always the possibly of late frosts at Whipsnade but it is also
important to allow the colony to establish itself on the nesting site early in
the season. It was therefore decided to allow the birds out earlier and risk
the problems of a late frost which luckily did not arise.
When released into their improved area in 1997 the flamingos built 11
nests, all of which went on to contain eggs, although only three went on to
hatch, in July. This was regarded as a very satisfactory result but again

could have been down to the weather and idiosyncrasies within the colony.
We were delighted therefore this year that the flamingos produced nine eggs,
four of which hatched.
The very changeable weather this spring and summer resulted in the
flamingos treading as early as March, only to be put off and having to start
again in May. Luckily they were persistent, eventually laying in June and
July. It is not known exactly which factors caused them to fail to breed for
four years but the recent successes are very encouraging.
As a nice addition this year, the staff on the Asian region hand-reared a
Greater Flamingo from Flamingo Gardens and Zoological Park at Weston
Underwood, near Olney. The colony there is on breeding loan from
Whipsnade and it came from an egg hatched there and gave Whipsnade
staff an opportunity to hand-rear this difficult species.
Once the Rosy Flamingo chicks were independent the hand-reared
Greater Flamingo was integrated with them away from the main colony.
After a few days, when all the chicks seemed settled, they were returned to
the colony and have all been accepted. The Greater Flamingo will be moved
to join the appropriate race in the future, however this period of socialising
will be beneficial to the hand-reared bird and allows us to continue to monitor
its development relatively easily.

FIRST STEPS FORWARD IN THE BREEDING OF THE
PLUM-CROWNED PIONUS Pionus tumultuosus
AT LORO PARQUE
</sectionHeader>

The Plum-Crowned Pionus Pionus tumultuosus has a unique blend of
qualities which make this species fascinating to aviculturists. Its beauty,
quiet and interesting behaviour combined with considerable captive
management and breeding challenges have ensured that for those who have
been fortunate enough to work with this species in captivity on the few
occasions when successful breeding has been achieved, the breeding of few
other species could have given greater satisfaction.
The Plum-crowned Pionus measures about 29cm (approx. 11 '/ 2 m) in
length. Weights recorded for the adult pair at Loro Parque at the end of the
1996 breeding season were: male 224g and female 265g. The general colour
is green which is paler on the underside of the body. The feathers of the
sides of the head are red, tipped purple, with white bases to the feathers
showing through, particularly below the eyes. The crown of the head is
darker red, which becomes purple-red on the neck and breast. The under
tail- coverts are bright red with yellowish-green tips. The bill is olive-yellow;
the legs and feet are grey. Immature birds vary from the adults in having the
nape and hindneck green like the back, the cheeks and breast are also green.
The under tail-coverts of immature birds are also yellowish-green with only
slight red markings. Little recent field information is available to assess the
size of the wild population although it is known that this species prefers
high altitude mountain regions at 2,000m (approx. 6,500ft) and higher in
eastern Peru and Bolivia, which is perhaps the main limiting factor to the
size of the wild population. The Plum-crowned Pionus has always been
extremely rare in aviculture and poor captive breeding results have now
brought the Plum-crowned Pionus to the point where it has almost
disappeared from aviculture.
A single male was present at Loro Parque for many years, until a young
female was located in South Africa, bred there by Dr Deon Smith. The pair
settled down well together but no signs of breeding were recorded prior to
my arrival at Loro Parque in 1994. As with all of the other pairs of Pionus,
the pair of Plum-crowned have two feeding periods each day. At 7.00am
they are given a main dish of approximately 60g of diced salad which
comprises items such as apple, pear, lettuce, tomato, orange, beetroot, alfalfa,
red pepper, banana, palm fruit and carrot. A second food dish supplies the
birds with approximately 30g of commercial pelleted food (Pretty Bird Hi-
protein special) which is available to the birds throughout the day. At 3.00pm

the remains of the salad are removed and replaced by a new dish containing

Drinking water is available to the birds at all times and is from a special
filtered supply which passes through a series of chlorination, reverse osmosis
filtration and finally ultra-violet light sterilisation. In addition the birds are
provided with daily showers in the late morning or early afternoon from a
fine mist spray sprinkler system which is included in the design of every
exhibition cage in the parque.

During the early part of the 1994 breeding season, the pair were
transferred to a newly constructed exhibition area for Pionus and had settled
down well by the second part of 1994, but without showing any signs of
nesting behaviour. No serious attempts were made at breeding by the pair
during 1995 or 1996, most probably due to construction work taking place
from mid-1995 to early 1996 on a new cinema in the parque very close to
the Pionus cages. When this disturbance ceased in spring 1996 the behaviour
of the birds improved and indications of breeding were observed. The female
spent several weeks during which she frequently entered the nest-box and
the nesting medium was chewed into a scrape, but no eggs were laid.
In spring 1997 the pair again began to show signs of breeding behaviour,
and on February 19th laid their first egg. The clutch eventually consisted of
three eggs but after they had been in the nest-box for several days it was
evident from nest-box inspections that they were not being incubated
properly. I removed the eggs and placed them in an incubator. When first
candled they all had large air-cells, but no sign of fertility could be seen.
After five days in the incubator all three eggs began to show embryo
development but none of the embryos survived past 16 days of incubation,
probably due to the early period of poor brooding by the parents.
The pair continued to show breeding behaviour and a second clutch of
eggs was laid, beginning on April 27th. On this occasion we had the option
of a pair of Maximilian's Parrots Pionus maximiliani which were incubating
nearby and which could be considered as potential foster-parents. The Plum-
crowned Pionus laid four eggs in their second clutch and so two eggs were
removed and fostered under the Maximilian's Parrots. The other two eggs
remained with the natural parents, together with one of the Maximilian's
eggs so that the clutch-size of the Plum-crowned Pionus was not changed
too dramatically and numbered three instead of four eggs. The remaining
Maximilian's Parrot eggs were taken for artificial incubation and rearing.
The pair of Plum-crowned Pionus failed to hatch their own eggs, but did
hatch and rear the single Maximilian's Parrot chick thereby demonstrating
good parental ability. Once the Maximilian's Parrot chick was a few days
old, the two unsuccessful Plum-crowned Pionus eggs were removed,
measured and necropsied. Both showed embryo death at mid-term of
incubation. External measurements of the eggs were 38.3mm x 27.4mm
and 34.6mm x 27.0mm.
Meanwhile the pair of Maximilian's Parrots had managed to hatch both
of the Plum-crowned Pionus eggs that they had been given. On discovering
that the chicks had hatched our thoughts turned immediately to considering
what steps could be taken to reduce the possibility of fungal conditions such
as aspergillosis, which have been the most significant problem in the
successful breeding of this species in captivity. Prior to the breeding season

the nest-box was disinfected and provided with clean wood shavings as a
nesting medium, and these were lightly dusted to prevent a parasitic
infestation. By the time that the chicks hatch the nesting medium has become
soiled, not to a degree which would normally cause me concern, but in the
case of this species extra caution was deemed prudent. We waited until the
fifth day and then the nesting medium was quickly replaced with clean
shavings. The chicks when viewed closely are among the most attractive
that can be encountered in the Parrot family. The primary natal-down is
dense and soft white in colour, similar to that of newly hatched Keas Nestor
notahilis and chicks of the black cockatoos of the genus Calyptorhynchus.
On June 12th the chicks were handled briefly to ascertain if they were
ready for closed leg bands to be fitted, and at this time they were weighed
and crop and cloacal swabs were taken as a precaution. The chicks appeared
in very good body condition but the cultures from the cloacal swabs showed
a significant growth of E. coli (more than is routinely seen from other similar
parent reared chicks of this age), and so a three days course of antibiotics
was administered without any significant interruption to the chicks' growth
rate. Subsequently, the wood shavings were changed regularly until the
time of fledging.
On July 15th we suffered a great disappointment when we discovered
that one of the chicks had died in the nest-box. The necropsy was
inconclusive, although a fungal infection was considered the most probable
cause. The remaining chick was then removed from the nest-box and
transferred to the clinic. Now close to being fully feathered the chick was
initially given three feeds a day and was subject to close observation. The
young bird seemed strong and showed no sign of either fungal or bacterial
infection, but it remained very nervous. After two days it was introduced to
a young Lilacine Amazon Amazona a. lilacina which, due to a leg fracture
just before fledging, had also been brought into the clinic. The Lilacine
Amazon was more confident in its behaviour and began feeding from the
food dish almost immediately. The Pionus remained more nervous but
certainly became more confident in the company of the Amazon and after a
week was also starting to eat from the food dish. The chick was eventually
eating on its own four weeks after being brought into the clinic. The young
bird was now in beautiful condition with a richness in the coloration of the
plumage which was even more striking than that of the male parent which I
have long considered to be one of the most beautiful birds in the parrot
collection at Loro Parque.

The following article was first published in the magazine in July 1934.
Walter Goodfellow was born in 1866 and died in 1953. Alan Gibbard wrote
about him in the Avicultural Magazine, 92, 4:220-221, and noted that an
Obituary notice written by David Seth-Smith was published in the magazine
in 1955. Goodfellow is credited with having brought to the notice of science
the Mount Apo Lorikeet Trichoglossus johnstoniae and the Mikado Pheasant
Syrmaticus mikado, and with introducing the first living specimens of them
to aviculture. He also brought to Britain the first Duivenbode&apos;s Lories
Chalcopsitta duivenbodei and Bulwer's Pheasants Lophura bulweri - in 1919.

THE ROYAL PARROT FINCH Erythrura cyaneovirens regia
by Walter Goodfellow
I think the introduction of this beautiful finch to this country is quite a
landmark in aviculture. Why it has been so long delayed 1 don't know
unless it is the difficulty and expense in getting to the far off islands where
it lives.
It was first described by Dr Sclater in 1881 from a skin collected by
Captain Kenneth Howard, R.N., on the island of Epi in the New Hebrides,
and this skin and a spirit specimen are still the only ones in the British
Museum. American collectors, however, were out there a few years ago,
and got a good series of skins from the type locality and other small islands
nearby, which together form what is known as the Shepherd Group. It was
to these islands Mr Shaw Mayer and I went.
For a long time I had this bird in my mind hoping one day to be the first
to get it alive, but the great drawback was, that these islands are very poor in
bird life, and there was nothing else there to make it worthwhile in case of
failure. Last year when Mr Mayer returned from New Guinea I found he
had been considering the same thing, so we joined forces and set out. I must
say though that when we left England it was perhaps more with the intention
of going to New Guinea, but as yyie had first to go to Australia in either case,
we decided to leave it open until we got to Sydney and saw how the boats
fitted in. When we found there was one leaving for the New Hebrides in
five days we made up our minds to risk it, as it was by no means certain if
Royal Parrot Finches would be in sufficient numbers to pay expenses, and I
am afraid they were not.
Vila, the only port in the islands, is some ten days from Sydney, and
from there on it is difficult to get to some of the islands, and always with
great delay, so if we made a wrong choice much time would be lost and
great expense incurred. This is one of the drawbacks in going to the more

out of the way very small islands, some of which are so unhealthy, and the
chance of getting any accommodation at all uncertain, as camping out during
six months of the year is quite out of the question owing to the possibility of
hurricanes which periodically devastate the islands. Two such occurred last
year on the island where we collected, and one last January while we were
there, of which more later.
I doubt if there is one New Hebrides island without any parrot finches.
Close around the little settlement of Port Vila we saw small flocks of the
Blue-faced E. trichroa every day feeding on the grass seeds in the coconut
plantations; and on some of the islands further north (Ambrym for one)
E. c. serena and the Blue-faced are both to be found. The former of these,
also a beautiful bird, was first discovered as far back as 1860 when
MacGillivray procured one on the island of Aneyteum right down south.
This distribution is rather curious as typical regia also inhabit an island in
the Banks Group in the extreme north, while the intervening islands have
other sub-species. We thought it best to go to the type locality and get true
regia, which after all is the most beautiful of all the parrot finches either
from the New Hebrides or elsewhere. When in full plumage I think there is
no doubt that it is the most beautiful finch known. Gouldians Chloebia
gouldiae look pale and washed out in comparison with the striking contrast
of the scarlet, blue and green of the Royal Parrot Finch, and I may as well
say here it seems to be as hardy as any finch known. Out of all ours we only
lost three. One of these we had to destroy because of a deformed leg, and
the other two escaped in Tahiti on our way home when the cages were being
cleaned out under very difficult conditions. What our birds had to go through
and survived only ourselves know. We changed to three boats before we
got home, and sometimes this was late at night after the birds had gone to
bed. Colon on the Panama Canal was one port where we changed from a
French boat to an English one. The cages were lowered by ropes over the
side into a launch at 10.00pm, and none too gently either, and then left in the
Customs shed all night on shore. To hear the birds dashing about it seemed
as if they would all be fatally injured.
After we arrived at Vila from Sydney our steamer was making a special
trip to some of the principal islands, so we took advantage of this to become
acquainted with them before deciding on a collecting ground. In this way
we visited Malekula where there are still cannibals inland, Esperitu Santo,
Tangoa and many others, finally returning to Vila. A week later we embarked
on a still smaller boat, indescribably dirty, for our final destination, which
we reached after three days. I shall always see the picture in my mind of
this beautiful island as we approached it in the early morning through a sea
like glass. It rose before us mountainous, and clothed in tropical verdure to
its summits, and how we scanned it through our glasses to see if we could

detect any open grassy spaces where the finches would be likely to feed, but
in vain. The boat only stopped long enough to put us and our baggage
ashore and then was off again. Had she stayed longer I really believe after
we had been on shore a day we should have re-embarked and chosen another
island as this seemed so unpromising.
We neither saw any of the finches nor any ground where they would be
likely to feed (from our point of view), nor even any suitable grasses, neither
did the local people seem to know the birds we were after. It was several
days before we could make them understand, and longer before we definitely
got its true local name, although we had the assistance of two white traders
who spoke the language. We had mentioned the redhead, so they jumped to
the conclusion that it was the Cardinal Honeyeater Myzomela cardinalis we
wanted and gave its name 'Susupaumiel'. At length after interviewing scores
of local people we made them understand, and found the right name, which
is 'Taputi'; the 'u' is pronounced like a double 'o' and means a grass-plucker.
In some of the villages they called it 'Taput' without the final 1&apos;.
When asked where they were to be found, they pointed to the great banyan
trees. My experience of other species of the family was that they went in
flocks, fed on the ground, and were easy to catch, so we were inclined to
think that we might still be on the wrong track, but when they told us the
Americans on the yacht La France had been after the same bird a few years
before, we thought they must be right, as we knew they had collected skins
of the Royal Parrot Finch on this island. We found one might live there for
months or even years and never see one, because after all it is true they live
in the tops of trees and feed on fruit. In a way it is practically a fruit-eating
finch.
Two traders who had lived there for years had never seen the bird or
heard of it, neither had the only white woman, the daughter of the pioneer
missionary, who was born and brought up on the island and spoke the local
language fluently. I mention this to show how concealed the birds must be
in their treetops, and this on an island where the number of species is very
small.
There are several kinds of ficus or banyan trees growing on the islands,
so one or other is never without fruit, and it is on these the regias feed.
Some of these trees are simply stupendous, but the one they liked best is
called 'Nambiilifer' with the accent on the second syllable, and after that
'Naida'. The others were not of much consequence so far as their fruits
were concerned, and I imagine they only eat them when times were hard.
The 'Nambulifer' was the size of a large cherry, dark maroon on the outside.
The birds bite through the rather hard outer flesh to get at the tiny fig-like
seeds embedded in a sweet pulp in the centre, which they crack and eat; so
it is easy to understand why they have such strong bills for their size. When

feeding they pluck a ripe fruit and carry it to a stout branch, where holding
it under their strong claws, peck through the outer part until they reach the
seeds, and each bird always returned to the same branch it had chosen. By
watching this and placing lime there, was the way they were caught. This
was tedious work as they were only obtained one by one and sometimes for
days together none at all.
Of course we had to have local help, and like all such people, although
they were well paid, quickly tired of the work as the novelty wore off, and
left us; in fact most of them seemed to think it derogatory to catch birds at
all except for food, and laughed at those who did. We never found one man
who carried on right through to the end. It was rather surprising how few
full-plumaged birds were caught. We must have had quite 20 before we got
one with a red head, although at the last they were rather more numerous.
We arrived on the island in early December, and some of those caught
then still showed the iridescent lumps at the gape, and had more or less
yellow bills of the very young birds, so I think they commence to breed in
October or even earlier. A nest containing three very young birds was brought
in after the first week. This is placed in a fork, or between two branches 30
feet (approx. 9.1 m) or more above the ground. It is a large domed structure
more oblong than round, rather loosely constructed 18 inches (460mm) deep,
with the opening at one end. The materials used in every case were dried
grass, dead leaves, fibre and the curly tendrils of some vine. The whole
thing had a very bleached appearance and many of the dead leaves were
skeletonised.
All over the island grow great thickets of a tall reed-like grass 12 feet
(approx. 3.6m) or more high which are used by the inhabitants to thatch
their houses, and it is the long narrow leaves of these, torn up, which the
birds use. The fine fibre had also been stripped out and very freely used.
This seemed rather a dangerous material, as a young bird from the first nest
had got some of it tightly twisted round a leg bringing the foot up to the
thigh, and so completely crippled I had to destroy it. In another nest was
one entangled by the wing, which was so badly swollen I thought it would
have to go too, but it eventually got all right and now I can't pick the bird
out, but it was bad for a long time. The nests have no lining but at the
bottom is a loose litter of broken grass and leaves probably caused by the
birds shuffling about.
It was always difficult to get the young ones without breaking up the
nest, for as I have mentioned before, their feet and claws are very strong,
even more pronounced when young, and with these they hold on to anything
they can grip, so much so that whenever one was picked up it always brought
another with it, either by the head, wing or leg, and tightly they held them
too. The claws were also used freely for climbing about. The opening to

the nest was usually fouled by droppings which consisted entirely of fig
seeds, dry and trodden quite hard. No nest contained more than three young
ones, and on two occasions only two, but in both these under the litter was
a clear egg pure white, so evidently three is the complete clutch. When first
hatched the bill is flesh-coloured. This quickly turns to yellow and before
they leave the nest it has become orange.
This looked strikingly beautiful against the dark blue heads of the first
plumage, but would probably not look so well against the scarlet of the
adult stage. The upper mandible quickly changes to a dingy black, beginning
at the tip and spreading upwards, but the sides of the lower mandible remain
more or less yellow for a long time. The legs and feet at first flesh-coloured,
gradually get darker, and finally blackish. In all I reared 17 young ones, but
one caught a chill after it could feed itself, through bathing late in the evening
during the hurricane when the temperature fell very low, and died the next
morning; and another from the last nest of all jumped from my hand onto
the verandah at Vila just as the sudden darkness of the tropical night came
on, and was lost under the house. The remaining 15 arrived here safely.
They were among the most delightful youngsters I have ever reared. They
all had enormous appetites, and it was really delightful to see a row of them
all with their orange bills wide open asking for food.
At first the iridescent nodules at the gape were bright blue, but quickly
lost their brilliance as the birds grew. On the palate were two crescent-
shaped patches, black, and very conspicuous when the mouths were open.
Long after they could feed themselves they still liked to be hand-fed, and
whenever I opened the cage door they jumped out of my hand and arm with
beaks wide open. I reared them on a mixture of fig seeds (crushed at first)
with the yolk of hard-boiled egg and biscuit meal which seemed to suit
them perfectly, and they were as easy to rear as any birds I have ever had.
At first the food was well moistened with water, but later given fairly dry.
When canary seed was supplied they took to it at once.
In their first plumage they had the head and upper breast very dark blue
shaded into a much lighter greenish-blue on the underparts, the rump dark
red and the tail brownish-red, the back and wings dirty green. At the time of
writing (May) they are now five and four months old, and all have red heads,
but not quite the bright cherry red of adult birds. Some, probably the older
ones, are quite bright blue on the back and fore-breast. It is not a fact as an
American ornithologist states (he was judging only from skins) that they
moult straight from the nest plumage to the adult, for the first change is
nothing like so bright, nor is the body entirely blue. This can be seen by the
pair in the Bird House at London Zoo. Individual birds seem to vary in
some particulars as we caught birds still showing the blue nodules at the
gape, while some of our hand-reared ones lost them even before they were

able to feed alone, and others again still showed them much later. Also the
bills turned black in some cases much sooner than in others from the same
nest. The females, according to the same ornithologist, are supposed to
have the wings entirely green, while the male has the wing-coverts the same
blue as the body, but we are still uncertain if this is quite correct.
On January 24th two young ones were brought to me which could not
have been more than a few hours old. They were so feeble and tiny, barely
an inch (25mm) long, it seemed impossible to do anything with them. They
were entirely flesh-coloured, body, bill and legs, and opened a minute oblong
mouth with the tips of the bill so slightly developed as to be all but invisible,
but the dark crescent marks on the palate and the blue spots at the gape were
highly conspicuous. I did my best with them and failed, but they lived for
four days.
The island we were on was entirely waterless so far as springs or wells
were concerned. The local people depend upon rain water and the birds
likewise. Fortunately the rainfall is heavy, but at times they suffer from a
shortage.
We found the Royal Parrot Finches extremely difficult to get on to seed.
At one time we thought we might have to bring them home as fruit-eating
finches. It was no good trying to starve them on to it, we did this for several
hours first thing every morning, neither would they take soaked seed. For
weeks we looked in vain for husks, then after a time a few grains of canary
seed were eaten by a few, but not enough to keep them alive. At first we
gave them their natural figs cut in half, and these they ate in quantities, but
made a dreadful mess of the cages and themselves by throwing the outer red
part about which stained everything crimson. Then we started to take the
seedy centres out on the point of a spoon, and mixed it with biscuit and the
yolk of hard-boiled egg. Flours and hours were spent every day over this
until we loathed the very sight of the fruits; moreover, the outer part of the
nai&apos;da variety contained an acid which after a time burnt away the skin on
the fingertips until they bled and became extremely painful. We put a local
man on the job, and at first he rather laughed at the effect of the fruit on us,
but after a few days he suffered just the same. We had thought that his
fingers would be harder. The birds were very fond of egg and 1 think this
kept them from falling off in condition. We kept up this egg and biscuit
even after they had taken well to seed, so we landed here without one weak
or thin bird. After we had left the islands and could get apples, we gave
them some every day, and greatly they enjoyed it, and lettuce also.
Unless one has great patience, and is prepared to stay on the islands until
the birds are well on to seed, it would be useless to go there for them. We
were quite afraid to move out of reach of the figs, not knowing how the
birds would fare when these were suddenly and entirely stopped.

The Blue-faced Parrot Finch E. trichroa and Red-headed Parrot Finch
E. psittacea certainly feed on grass seeds in the wild, but I imagine those
with entirely red heads, must have similar feeding habits to those of the
Royal Parrot Finch. Perhaps this is why so few Peale's E. c. pealei ever
come over, because so few survive until they are eating seeds. E. c.
cyaneovirens and E. c. serena have not yet been imported, but as neither of
them is as beautiful as E. c. regia , it is hardly worth while bringing them
when you can get the other. E. c. cyanovirens comes from Samoa and pealei
from Fiji.
There is still one more beautiful species to come, this is the Tri-coloured
Parrot Finch E. tricolor from Timor, discovered by Alfred Russel Wallace
in 1868. It is a green bird with the face and the whole of the breast blue. It
seems very desirable, and I have no doubt it is a grass feeder as Timor has
much open grass country. I have landed in the island, but never collected
there.
I mentioned how the New Hebrides are subjected to hurricanes and that
in January it was our ill luck to experience one. For more than two weeks
before we had constant high winds often reaching gale force and gloomy
skies. Later, as the wind grew still stronger, came torrential rains without
ceasing day or night. It seemed impossible to imagine so much rain, just as
if a sea was overhead, so solidly it came down, and one began to wonder if
the sun would ever shine again. The wind still increased until it reached the
peak which lasted more than a day. The palms bent nearly double, and
many snapped in two, while large branches were falling from other trees all
around. Nearly all leaves were stripped off, and the noise and chaos
bewildering. 1 was alone at the time, living in a ramshackle iron shanty
anything but watertight at the best of times, and two miles (3.2km) from the
nearest village. Mr Mayer was away weather-bound on a small island off
the coast unable to return. During the two worst nights I got a local man to
come and stay with me as I was afraid if the place went I should be unable to
cope with things single-handed. The local people were anxious for me to
move to the village, but for many reasons it was impracticable, as in the first
place I doubt if we could have got even the cages through the storm. Some
of the men spent the daylight hours with me, and with tree trunks and heavy
chains strengthened the place as much as possible, but most of them were
occupied in looking after their own places. Everything inside was a foot
(30cm) deep in mud and water, with bed and everything else wet through.
Cooking was mostly out of the question as fires were hard to keep alight.
How I looked after the birds I don't know, for they were not yet eating seed,
and fruits were impossible to get. Egg and biscuit was about all they had,
and even this under very difficult conditions. 1 used to wonder how the
birds were faring outside, for it seemed impossible that any could live through

it. A young zosterops was picked up near the house, blown from the nest,
which I managed to save and rear. The parrot finches must have suffered, as
all the ripe figs were stripped from the trees and lay rotten on the ground.
After the hurricane had died down I saw many boys pass by with bunches of
dead birds they had picked up. Yet after all this, just a week later, I had the
two youngest E. c. regias I have mentioned brought to me, so their nest had
escaped, and the parent birds must have sat through it all and hatched out
the eggs.
These hurricanes must do considerable damage to bird life throughout
the islands. It was days later before we began to hear again the beautiful
notes of the honeyeaters and the screeching of the lorikeets, but 1 thought
not so freely as before.
At the same time I was hand-rearing the young parrot finches I also
brought up successfully 16 zosterops of two species, the Yellow-fronted Z.
flavifrons perplexa and Grey-backed Z. lateralis vatensis. Some of these
were very newly hatched when brought in, but all lived, and also four
Massena's Lorikeets Trichoglossus haematodus massena. The zosterops
were reared on that invaluable fruit papaya (called in some parts pawpaw)
and the yolk of hard-boiled egg, while the lorikeets, of course, were brought
up on the sweet milk mixture.
Now we have introduced the Royal Parrot Finch over here, it remains to
be seen who will be the first to breed it.
The answer came the following year, when it was bred by C.H. Macklin,
whose accoun t of the breeding was published in the magazine in 1935.

In April 1934,1 obtained from Messrs. Goodfellow &amp; Mayer a pair of
Royal Parrot Finches from the first importation. They were young birds
and one still in juvenile plumage with the blue head, but they turned out to
be a true pair, although the sexual difference did not show clearly until their
first full moult nearly a year after I obtained them. Then it was easy to see
that the male had considerably more blue than green in the body plumage in
comparison with the female and his red head was distinctly brighter; the red
also extended a little further back on the nape of the male.
When 1 first got them their wings were badly frayed, but they were so
wild in a cage that I decided to risk it and put them in an outdoor aviary;
here they spent most of their time climbing and hopping about in the shrubs
and soon the male was flying well, but the female was rather weak on the

wing. By the end of the summer they had grown new flight feathers and
were both in very good plumage, but had made no attempt whatever to nest.
They 'did themselves' very well, taking large quantities of softfood,
mealworms, spray millet, apple and greenfood, seeding grass, chickweed,
and lettuce; they took very little of the ordinary seed mixture of canary and
millet.
In October I took them indoors and tried to steady them in order to show
them, and did manage to send them to Cambridge, Hitchin, and Leicester,
where they took first prizes in their class; steadiness was not one of their
good points, and at Nottingham they dropped to 'Commended', for by this
time they had worn off a lot of feathers round the beak and broken some of
their tail and flight feathers. This was in November, and I then put them in
an indoor aviary, where they were much quieter than in the cage, in fact
cage life definitely does not suit them. About the end of February they
started a good moult which they finished early in April. On April 15th I put
them outdoors in the same aviary they had occupied the previous summer.
This aviary was designed for waxbills with 3 /s in (1 Omm) mesh wire and
consists of a glass-fronted shelter 4ft 6in x 5ft x 5ft 6in high in the front and
6ft 6in at the back (approx. 1.4m x 1.5m x 1.7m high in the front and 2m at
the back); matchboard sides, boarded floor, and boarded and felted roof; a
covered flight with open front and boarded floor 4ft 6in x 5ft (approx. 1,4m
x 1.5m) and an open flight 12ft x 5ft (approx.3.6m x 1.5m). The back of the
flight is an ivy covered wall and there are growing shrubs of box, euomymus
and prunus; the floor is partly turfed and partly a sanded path.
The parrot finches had for company pairs of Cherry Finches Aidemosyne
modesta, Cuban Finches Tiaris canora, Aurora Finches Pytilia
phoenicoptera , Greater St. Helena Waxbills Estrilda astrild , Green Avadavats
Amandavaformosa, Lavender Finches E. caerulescens and a male Amethyst-
rumped Sunbird Nectarinia zelonica; they were therefore the largest birds
in the aviary, but they have always been well behaved, taking very little
notice of the other occupants except to get the biggest share of the
mealworms, of which they are very fond.
Within a week of being turned out they began to build a nest and chose
for the site a 'Hartz' travelling cage hung up in the top corner of the inside
shelter farthest from the door to the flight. I had put a wisp of hay in the
cage, and they proceeded to fill it up with grass stems, dead leaves, pieces
of straw, and fibrous grass roots which they found in the flight. On examining
the nest after the young birds had flown I found it was very compactly made;
the entrance was in the form of a sloping tunnel which went up about three
inches (7.5cm) to the nest proper. They took about a fortnight to construct
the nest and on May 15th I dared to investigate with my finger and could
just reach the nest cavity and feel that there were eggs. After this I left the

nest severely alone and did not even venture into the shelter. Both the birds
sat, the female chiefly at night and the male during a good part of the day.
On June 3rd I heard faint squeaks coming from the nest, and for the next
week the young birds were loud in their clamour for food but were quieter
later. The parents fed them frequently, using chiefly the softfood and
mealworms; they also helped themselves to the sunbird's nectar quite freely
at this time and ate a good deal of apple and seeding grass.
On June 9th I got a peep at the nest while both the parents were out in the
flight and, by using an electric lamp and mirror, could see that there were
two youngsters and that they were just getting their wing and tail quills. On
June 22nd they were ready to leave the nest; in fact for a day or two I had
seen two little yellow bills at the entrance.
Unfortunately it turned very hot and the temperature rose tremendously
inside the shelter where the nest was, near the roof, and one of the youngsters
collapsed and died in the nest entrance; the other I found in the outside
flight; he was quite strong on the wing and roosted outside in the ivy and
never went back to the nest.
The young had dark green bodies and wings, deep blue heads, and red
tails and tail-coverts; the beak was orange yellow, ornamented at the corners
of the wide gape with four luminous blue spots; the legs and feet were whitish
grey.
Both parents fed the youngster frequently, regurgitated food from the
crop in the usual grassfinch manner. By June 25th he was pecking at spray
millet and soon helped himself to softfood. He is now (July 11th) quite
independent and is doing well. The beak is still yellow but the luminous
spots at the corners have nearly gone and he has lost his babyish look and is
now as big as the female.
The parents have built a second nest in the shelter again but this time in
a small wooden box about 6in x 4in x 4in (approx. 15cm x 10cm x 10cm),
with half the front open; it is again very compact, made of grass stems, bits
of straw, dead leaves and roots; no feathers were used either time. There are
now three eggs and the birds have just started to sit. I am hoping this time to
be able to supply some live ant 'eggs', which they liked last year and which
will probably be better for the young birds than too many mealworms.
The Royal Parrot Finch is a fascinating little bird but needs extra care; it
does not do well in a cage and will not live on seed alone, for it is much
keener on livefood and softfood. The male has apparently no song and their
only note is a high-pitched bat-like squeak which they use to call to each
other.

A FERAL ALEXANDRINE AND OTHER ESCAPEES

One day in May 1997 1 arrived at the children's home where I work, to
find a wooden box on the lawn, covering a pile of fruit and nuts. The box
was propped up by a stick, to which a length of string was attached. At the
other end of the string was a hopeful small boy, who told me a 'green parrot'
had been in the garden and that he was going to catch it and sell it for a small
fortune. Later that day the bird turned up again, revealing itself to be an
adult male Alexandrine Parrakeet Psittacula eupatria. Very wary, it came
no closer than the top of a 50ft (approx. 15m) tall conifer at the end of the
garden. I borrowed a Larsen cage trap of the kind normally used to catch
crows and magpies. With a male Ringneck P. krameri in the decoy
compartment, and his mate in an aviary nearby, the two Ringnecks called to
each other continually. This we felt would be irresistible to the free-flying
Alexandrine. Through many attempts with the Larsen, over a period of
weeks, the Alexandrine showed no interest at all. One evening, while
removing the male Ringneck and trap from the roof, I was hailed by a
neighbour who asked me to stop trying to catch the fugitive. 'It's a wild
animal and it's called George' she told me. It transpired that this lady was
hand feeding 'George' every afternoon at her bird table. Some fifteen months
later, having survived a mild winter, this happy arrangement continues.
Excessively wary in other situations, the Alexandrine flies to our neighbour's
bird table for his daily handout. Having seen Ringnecks feral in this country,
and wild in Pakistan, the Alexandrine appears somewhat less graceful on
the wing, although a powerful flier. Goodwin (1989) refers to a female
Alexandrine consorting with feral Ringnecks in Kent, emphasising the
former's much heavier appearance when flying.
Feral Ringnecks are scarce in Dorset; given 'George's' lack of interest
in confined ones it would be interesting to see if he relates any more positively
to free-flying parrakeets. Even in his solitary state, he forms an attractive
addition to our local garden birds. Local rumour maintains that a pet parrot
was lost by a holidaymaker in Weymouth some nine miles (almost 13km)
away in the spring of 1997. Early life as a caged pet might account for this
Alexandrine's apparent lack of interest in other parrots.
Two years ago, I let a friend have a pair of young Barnacle Geese Branta
leucopsis , both hatched in 1996. The female had been reared by a bantam
and then reintroduced as a grown bird to her natural parents, so was well
socialised to Barnacles. The young gander had been obtained, with a brother
and their&apos;parents from some people who maintained that both goslings had
been reared by two female white domestic geese, after being deserted by

their parents. While I find this difficult to believe and the brother has paired
appropriately, the gander given to my friend has demonstrated a very odd
outlook on life. Within weeks of being moved, he had bonded with a female
Lesser White-fronted Goose Anser erythropus of the same age. This could
not be allowed, so the offending gander and his intended Barnacle mate
were removed to an enclosed lake where the gander's natural parents had
become established. For the next eighteen months the young male Barnacle
failed to associate either with the other Barnacles or with Snow Geese A.
caerulescens. With his reported upbringing by domestic geese, he might
have shown an interest in the white Snows. One day in the spring of 1998,
a Lesser White-front (unlikely to be of genuinely wild origin) flew in and
has stayed ever since, firmly paired to the young Barnacle gander. That the
White-front appears to be a male makes no difference to the strength of
their relationship.
Escaped Zebra Finches Poephila guttata turn up where least expected.
I retrieved one from someone's conservatory, and a small flock of pied
examples on a local grazing marsh one summer were reported initially as
out-of-season Snow Buntings Plectrophenax nivalisl Zebra Finches that
have got out here, always decamped immediately and permanently, while
Bengalese sat about happily until someone popped a net over them. A
wandering Red-cheeked Cordon-bleu Uraeginthus bengalus attracted to
others in an aviary, flew in as soon as I opened the door.
Twice in recent years I have stopped my car to examine an apparent
road-killed Tawny Owl Strix aluco, which turned out to be a female Reeves'
Pheasant Syrmaticus reevesi. Escaped avicultural subjects can be a danger
to native species, and occasionally to farmers' crops. When not taken too
seriously, they also make life more interesting.

ANOTHER BIRD-KEEPING CLERIC

By comparison with the Rev. C.D. Farrar, whose name illuminates several
of the pages of Dave Coles' First Breeding Records , that of another bird-
keeping parson, the Rev. J.R. Lowe appears only once as a result of his
success in 1966 with Tickell's Flycatcher Cyornis tickelliae. But despite
this disparity I suspect the two clergymen probably had much in common -
a conclusion based on familiarity with Farrar's classic Through a Bird Room
Window and later through my friendship with this other bird-keeping
clergyman who was, in effect, Farrar's counterpart 60 years on.
While my late father was the person who first instilled an interest in bird
keeping by ensuring I had feathered birthday presents from an early age
(and while he never exhibited, he retained an eye for a good finch, mule or
hybrid throughout his lifetime), it was Jack Lowe who really influenced my
thinking from the time I first met him in the early 1960s. If he was around
today I am sure he would disagree with my theorising about our friendship
- which I believe had its roots in the fact that both of us were somewhat
haphazard in our choice of species. In other words we were more inclined
towards mixed collections than a desire for any kind of specialisation - a
lack of discipline which would, quite properly, be deplored nowadays.
Canon Lowe was vastly more experienced in the care and management
of species which, for me, were generally no more than items on a wishful
shopping list. But at the time I kept foreign softbills and seedeaters, a few
British finches, Light Sussex bantams, the odd few pheasants and waders,
some small doves and quail; I even owned several hemipodes when we first
met. Jack had a variety of small foreigners ranging from Violet-eared
Waxbills Uraeginthus granatina to hummingbirds, various British finches
and softbills, a stud of Norwich Canaries, a pen of Marans and a loft housing
some excellent racing pigeons. There was also 'Sparky' - a macaw of
indeterminate species which presided over the garden at Jack's Backford
vicarage from the security of a lofty apple tree. As readers will again
recognise, there was, regrettably, little or no specialisation in our respective
collections but I suppose (and I hope members will pardon a poor pun) we
were birds of a feather.
I almost collided with Canon Lowe at a National Show in the 1950s - a
first and entirely inauspicious meeting for we exchanged not a word. It was
at a time when British softbills were exhibited and if my memory serves me
right, the near coming together was the result of a joint desire to admire a
pair of Lesser Whitethroats Sylvia curruca.
At the time his parish was at Coin St. Aldwyn in Gloucestershire and

since I lived in Manchester there seemed little prospect our paths would
cross again in the immediate future. But in the early 1960s the long arm of
coincidence touched us both: I was transferred from my company's
Manchester office to Liverpool and Meg and I chose to live in Chester.
Coincidentally, at around the same time, Jack Lowe and his family moved
from Gloucestershire to a new parish near Chester - just a couple of miles
down the lanes from our new home. We allowed what we thought was a
decent interval to elapse (about a week) following the announced date of
the Lowes' arrival before driving over to Backford in the hope that an
aviculturist I had long admired from a distance might be at home. He was.
It was a hot summer afternoon (remember them?) and we watched
fascinated from outside the gates of the vicarage's large garden as a tall
silver-haired figure materialised from a tangle of undergrowth to immediately
berate a perspiring workman who was attempting to transform around five
miles of aviary mesh and (at a conservative estimate) half a forest of larch
poles into a range of aviaries. A short and heated altercation followed from
which we gathered the man had misunderstood one of the Canon's more
obscure instructions regarding a supply of running water in the aviaries - an
excellent idea but one which, ten years later, had still not materialised.
Fortunately our arrival dissipated the clergyman's irritation to some extent
and we retired to the tranquillity of the vicarage for cold beers all round.
The chap building the aviaries was not forgotten, either. k Better give that
bloody man a glass of water&apos;. Jack instructed his ever-patient wife, Phyll
who, as we soon discovered, had the invaluable ability of being able to take
her husband's occasional eccentric lapses in her stride, thus ensuring that
tradesmen ranging from window-cleaners to milkmen, sundry members of
the Parish Council and other tiresome intruders were held-off at arm's length,
but always in a state of what might be described as uncertain optimism.
While the Canon's bird-keeping interests were wide-ranging I always
had a sneaking feeling that British insectivorous species were particularly
dear to his heart, although foreign species were also prominent in his
collection. Most of the birds were housed outside only during the spring -
autumn period, after which they were transferred to various spare rooms in
the vicarage - even the bathroom provided accommodation from time to
time.
The workman we had seen on our first visit eventually produced an
excellent range of aviaries, built against an ancient wall which might once
have been part of a stable block or some other substantial structure. None
was provided with anything resembling a formal shelter and in any case,
within a couple of years, such refinements would have been superfluous for
the interiors supported some of their owner's favourite plants - nettles,
brambles, bindweed and other natives which were cultivated with the sort

of zeal an enthusiastic gardener lavishes on prize dahlias and
chrysanthemums. This natural cover was eventually so dense that Jack found
himself locked inside on one occasion when, as he remained unseen in the
green wilderness, his grandson helpfully bolted the safety porch door fearing
(he later claimed) the birds might escape.
I particularly remember his success with Tickell's Flycatcher Cyornis
tickelliae in the mid-1960s. Both male and female were tame, confident
birds - what is more they were compatible and shared an indoor flight without
problem throughout the winter. The following spring they were transferred
to one of the larger aviaries. Although Jack was cautiously optimistic about
their chances, I suspect he had given no serious thought to the possibility of
a first successful UK breeding of the species for, as was often the case at
Backford, they were part of a larger community of birds sharing the flight.
However, all went well and the Tickell's, astonishingly tolerant of both
companions and their owner's frequent presence in the aviary, hatched three
fine youngsters.
Jack Lowe was also an enthusiastic breeder of mules and hybrids - not
on a regular basis but usually as a result of having a likely-looking pair of
something or other on his hands. At around the time his flycatchers bred,
this other interest was given a shot in the arm when he succeeded in producing
a hybrid between a male Purple Grenadier Uraeginthus ianthinogaster and
female Violet-eared Waxbi 11 U. granatina.
One youngster was reared - a male - and despite my aversion to such
mixed marriages 1 had to concede that it was a particularly handsome bird.
Writing about the achievement in the Avicultural Magazine in 1966 he
explained that each of the parents had lost their mates as a result of '...a
contretemps with a flying squirrel'. It was a revelation I only came upon a
few years ago and it certainly threw new light on something which had
puzzled my wife and myself at the time.
I can now reveal that the squirrel in question, &quot;Flip&apos; had previously
belonged to Meg and lived at liberty in our dining room. The little animal
spent the hours of daylight asleep in a box above the pelmet, becoming
active towards dusk. When he first saw 'Flip', Jack was captivated and
eventually made a point of dropping in quite often, late in the afternoon, in
the hope the flying squirrel would be out and about. At the time Meg had
her hands full with two small children and in view of our friend's obvious
interest we wondered whether he would like to have 'Flip&apos; at Backford. To
say he was delighted is an understatement and a couple of days later he took
the animal home carrying the box as proudly as if he had just been given a
new rare bird to add to his collection.
A couple of weeks later an unusually subdued clergyman appeared at
the door wanting '...a quiet word with Meg'. The two of them disappeared

into the kitchen and when I went through to make some coffee I noticed
Jack doing a spot of hand-wringing and talking to Meg with the practiced
air of a man accustomed to breaking bad news. But things seemed perfectly
normal over coffee and biscuits and eventually he departed, as usual throwing
a wisecrack in my direction.
'Well, that's rather sad', said Meg afterwards - and went on to explain
the Canon's mission. The flying squirrel had died. I expressed my
condolences and asked what had happened - had it died in its sleep, contracted
an illness, got itself trapped in the bell tower? 'No', explained Meg, 'they
found him drowned in the font'. Reflecting on the matter the following day,
I remembered that 'Flip' had lived at the vicarage - and the nearest font was
300yds (approx. 275m) down the lane at St Oswald's. Best, I thought, to let
departed squirrels rest in peace!
My friend and I frequently visited bird shows where Jack was usually
held in considerable awe by his fellow birdmen, for he knew what he was
talking about and was not averse to offering opinions about anything from
the quality of the tea to the condition of some of the exhibits - although his
comments were invariably tongue-in-cheek.
Quite often there were problems actually getting to these events for we
travelled in the Lowes' venerable Austin Cambridge (by coincidence finished
in a rather fetching shade of clerical grey), and the Canon harboured a belief
that, except when forced to reverse, the gear lever was purely for ornament.
Thus we would move off from the vicarage somewhat haltingly in third
gear, remaining thus even when forced to halt at traffic lights or reduce
speed in order to make a turn, until the vehicle staggered to a halt.
The consequences of this unswerving faith in the internal combustion
engine's ability to rise above such mistreatment were obvious to all but the
driver for during the course of most of our journeys the engine would
eventually begin to stutter, miss and eventually give up the ghost with a sort
of strangled sigh. My chauffeur invariably remained at the wheel for a
minute or two, muttering abuse while fiddling with the choke and ignition.
When, predictably, these activities failed to effect a cure, the next tactic was
to get out, walk round the vehicle and deliver a couple of hearty kicks -
usually to the tyres. Whether through luck or divine intervention, when he
again got back behind the wheel the car invariably started after which he
engaged first gear (for he knew the rudiments of what he was supposed to
do) and we would resume our journey ... with third gear selected almost as
soon as the car was in motion again.
In what he often described simply as 'the job' he was a first-rate country
parson, much loved by his parishioners at Backford and, I am certain, his
other parishes. For he was a diligent and caring churchman who cared deeply
for all the members of his flock, although he could be aloof in certain

situations and sometimes gave the impression of being an autocrat - which
he most certainly was not. Backford was his last parish before retirement
and even today, 30 years on, he is fondly rememberd by some of the older
inhabitatants.
Two other kinds of birds also claimed his interest - racing pigeons and
poultry. His pigeons were something of a talking point around the parish
for their comings and goings occasionally had an impact on events at St
Oswald's. Like the rest of his birds, the pigeons were of good quality - and
no slouches in the matter of long, cross-country flights when they headed
for their loft from some remote outpost where they had been released. Some
of these journeys were made at weekends and it was not unusual for the
birds to arrive back on Sundays. But while services continued at their normal
times, regulars knew they would not be kept over-long as the sermon would
be brief and to the point. Sometimes the home-going congregation would
catch sight of their still robed vicar heading at speed (he was 6ft 6in (almost
2m) in height with long strides to match) for the pigeon loft so he could
'clock-in' his feathered travellers as they arrived.
I often thought that alongside his flycatchers, Whinchats Saxicola rubetra
and other delightful little softbills, a splendid pen of Marans were another
particular source of pride - especially the cock, a magnificent bird which
must have weighed seven or eight pounds (about 3.4kg) and regularly
attacked its owner's shins whenever he entered the pen. The birds were
housed in quite a large grassed enclosure surrounded by a 6ft high (approx.
1,8m) wire-netting fence and with a shed for roosting.
I have the clearest recollections of an unfortunate incident involving
these particular birds when I was at the vicarage one day. Jack and myself
had retired to the bathroom to admire a recently acquired hummingbird - a
Fork-tailed Woodnymph Thaluraniafurcata - when his wife called urgently
that a Fox was in the hen pen.
A rapid sequence of events followed as Jack grabbed a gun from the hall
and headed in the direction of the poultry as I trailed in his wake. We were
in time to see the Fox heading for a shrubbery, beyond which was open
countryside, with a still struggling hen Maran in its jaws. My friend, a good
shot, took quick aim in the general direction of the rapidly disappearing
intruder and sent a hail of lead shot in the general direction of Fox and hen
pen. Simultaneously his prized cock Maran collapsed, mortally wounded,
and reduced to a twitching bundle of feathers. As we reached the scene of
the crime the bird's owner delivered a short soliloquy on the subject of four-
legged poultry thieves. It does not bear repeating here.
This has been more about the man than his birds. But while he was a
member of the Avicultural Society for many years and was a respected figure
within aviculture, little has been written about him. I hope these notes rectify

that omission. We shared many opinions and had only one real disagreement,
for after my juvenile flirtation with mule breeding I eventually developed a
deep aversion for hybrids of all kinds - a major shortcoming in Jack Lowe's
view but one which, nevertheless, caused him great amusement. Eventually,
though, he decided it was time to make a conciliatory gesture after I had
said something unkind about the offspring of a finch and a Norwich Canary.
'My dear boy', he said, 'I know you can't even bring yourself to use the
term 'mule' so why don't you just call them 'his Reverence's mongrels'?
He was a keen and experienced observer of wildlife, and it was always
an enlightening experience to spend an hour or so in his company walking
the fields or exploring a stretch of woodland. And while his collection of
birds dominated the vicarage and its gardens, there were all manner of other
odds and ends about the place; a tropical fish tank, axolotls, the odd snake -
even, for a while, a flying squirrel! For his grandchildren, who were part of
the Lowes' extended family at the vicarage, and our two small sons, there
was the chance to sit on the broad back of 'Adam', a donkey of slightly
dubious temperament. He was a gelding but the Canon attributed his
occasional bouts of irascibility (he was once spotted trotting past the French
windows, the wreckage of a field gate round his neck, heading towards
Chester) to the fact that the vet had done 'only half a job' on him.
During World War Two Canon Lowe served with distinction as a Chaplain
with the Royal Gloucester Hussars - a part of his life he never discussed
except to remark that it gave him the opportunity to 'do a spot of
bird watching'. He joined the Avicultural Society in 1927 and remained a
member until his death in 1971.

1995, and his wife Meg, continue to live in Chester - opposite the zoo .

SOME BIRDS SEEN IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
by Mike Curzon
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997249157894737" page_id="56285918"  page_num="124" year="" vol="">
November 12th to November 26th 1997 my wife Norma and myself
spent a holiday at Puerta Plata in the Dominican Republic. We saw a varied
selection of birds and, hopefully, these notes will prove of interest to fellow
members.
In the hotel grounds, which were well managed and alongside which is
a golf course with a number of lovely ornamental lakes, were numerous
Grey Kingbirds Tyrannus dominicenis. I have never seen them in captivity.
They are tyrant flycatchers and are the largest of the kingbirds seen in the
West Indies. They positioned themselves on the tops of palm trees and on
branches standing proud on the tops of trees and dived down to take
butterflies, flies and other insects. It was interesting watching them,
especially on the golf course where they would go after even larger butterflies,
some of which they could not take on the wing. They therefore knocked
them to the ground, then turned around and landed on the ground beside
them and finished them off. They are very agile and fly fast and one pair in
particular came down and picked up small yellow butterflies off a yellow
iris which was flowering alongside our room.
Another species very active in and around the hotel grounds was the
Red-legged Thrush Turdus plumbeus , which is basically grey, with a white
throat with black markings and, as its name suggests, bright red legs. These
thrushes always seemed to be on the move looking for food and when two
met they could be quite quarrelsome, with one seeing the other off its territory.
Tropical Mockingbirds Mimus gilvus were also very common and enjoyed
singing from high perches.
Greater Antillean Grackles Quiscalus niger would join us at the dinner
table in the open sided hotel dining room. They would pop in hoping that a
tit-bit would be dropped on the floor, whereupon they would grab it and
leave. By the side of our balcony was a sprinkler and each evening the
grackles would come and enjoy a bath in the puddle of clear, clean water.
They generally came in pairs but occasionally there would be three, about
an hour before the sun went down.
One evening I was down by a small, slow-flowing river approximately
20ft (about 6m) wide in the hotel grounds where the previous day I had seen
the Hispaniolan Lizard Cuckoo Saurothera vetula. I stationed myself beneath
some branches, and the first birds I saw were a pair of Black-crowned Palm
Tanagers Phaenicophdus palmarum. They were moving along the river
bank, going from shrub to shrub, and after they had moved off I heard a lot
of noise on the other bank where there was long grass and sugar cane out of

which appeared perhaps 200-300 Village Weavers Ploceus cucullatus.
Village Weavers were released onto Hispaniola and are now fairly common
and their nests can be seen in the trees. This large flock, the males in full
colour, zig-zagged its way across the river. The noise reminded me of the
flocks of Starlings Sturnus vulgaris which on occasions we get at Rode.
The weavers settled in the tree directly above me, bickering and falling out
with each other as weavers do. After half a minute they saw me and took off
to roost further down the river. After approximately 200yd (roughly 180m)
the river disappears into the beach. I saw Tricoloured or Louisiana Egretta
tricolor and Great Blue Herons Ardea herodias and Caribbean Coots Fulica
caribaea on this river, which had plenty of fish in it and lots of butterflies
and dragonflies flying above it.
Another interesting escapee or introduced species is the Spice Bird
Lonchura punctulata. One day whilst I was wandering around the golf
course I saw this small, brown bird and as 1 got closer realised that this
species must now be established on the island, which was confirmed on the
final day when I saw a group of six or seven feeding on grasses by the 17th
fairway. I had gone looking for the Least Bittern Ixobrychus exilis, which I
saw, then my attention was taken by a group of 30 Glossy Cowbirds
Monothrus bonariensis of which perhaps 20 were juveniles. They were
feeding in the grass.
A surprising aspect of our holiday was the absence of seabirds, apart
from two White-tailed Tropicbirds Phaethon lepturus which we saw in a
mangrove swamp during one of the numerous trips we went on, and four
Magnificent Frigatebirds Fregata magnificens at the end of the holiday. 1
was surprised, for example, that we did not see any gulls or terns. It would
be no exaggeration to say that we saw masses of Cattle Egrets Bubulcus ibis
- they seemed to be everywhere. It surprised me how many cattle and horses
are kept on the island. Away from the hotel towards the bay there are some
large trees by the river and at sunset hundreds of Cattle Egrets flew overhead
towards this communal roost site.
Ground has been cleared inland for growing tobacco which is one of the
main cash crops. On a trip inland we stopped for lunch by a waterfall and it
was there that I saw my only birds in captivity on the island. These were
Hispaniolan Amazons Amazona ventralis and West Indian Barn Owls Tyto
alba. They appeared to be pairs and in good condition despite the fact that
their accommodation was, to me, terrible. The Amazons were in an aviary
3ft wide x 6ft x 6ft (approx. 91.5cm wide x 1.83m x 1.83m), which looked
the worse for wear and I was unable to see what food they were being fed.
Neither could I see any food in the owls' aviary. It was of a similar size, it
had no perches and they were hiding in a cardboard box. I was told that
higher on the island local people will, if you are interested, sell you young

parrots for about #50-#60 (approx. US$80-US$96), for two babies which
are still being hand-reared or are almost reared. I would have liked to have
seen this species in the wild, but it was not to be.
On another trip on what is called 'the safari', we saw where Jurassic
Park was filmed. It is rolling green downland covered with palm trees and
at lunchtime I went for a walk and saw a male Vervain Hummingbird
Mellisuga minima. I was walking alongside a hedge and looked up and at
first thought it was a butterfly before realising that it was a hummingbird.
Later in the day I saw a female. I was captivated by my first sight of this
hummingbird, which is so small and fragile looking. On our last day we
went horse riding which took us through sugar cane, wooded areas and some
steep river gorges and at lunchtime we stopped and I again went for a walk.
I walked along a riverbed which, although there were some small pools was
otherwise all but dried out, and I saw three Hispaniolan Emerald
Hummingbirds Chlorostilbon swainsonii. While standing beneath the bank
watching them I saw a Broad-billed Tody Todus subulatus , which after flying
around settled 6ft (approx. 1,8m) above my head. I stood still watching it
and it in turn watched me for a little while before moving off into some
bushes, after having first flown up the valley. The red throat spot of this
white-breasted green-backed bird is very noticeable.
We saw only three species of birds of prey, for they were noticeably
scarce and were seen on only six occasions in the fortnight, although we did
see lots of vultures. We went to a beach area which had some lovely woodland
behind it and I again went walking for about one and a half hours. Among
the birds I saw were Bananaquits Coereba flaveola. Yellow-faced Grassquits
Haris olivacea, a lot of Hispaniolan Woodpeckers Melanerpes striatus and
the Hispaniolan Lizard Cuckoo. What really amazed me was the enormous
number of butterflies and the variety of species with their beautiful colours
and markings. One appeared to By in reverse in order to land on the bark of
a tree, on which it looked like lichen and so was well camouflaged against
predators.
Purple Gallinules Gallinula martinica are resident on the lakes on the
golf course. They are so much more elegant than the heavier-looking Asian
species Porphyrio porphyrio and in many respects look more like jaganas
and spend much of their time on the lily-pads. Whenever we went to the
water's edge they would come running towards us. Most of them appeared
to have chicks and were busy finding food for them, including water snails,
which they obtained from under the leaves and then called the chicks over
to be fed. I have not seen this species in captivity and would be very interested
in keeping it. I believe it would be less troublesome than the Asian species.
I also saw the Common Gallinule which is the West Indian race of the
Moorhen G. chloropus.

Whilst there we had some wet days but never one when it rained all day,
and we also had some dry days, whereas when we were there in November
1996, it rained every day. The birds were about to start breeding. Bananaquits
were busy building and I found two nests, the first in a date palm and the
second in a low hedge. The nests were the usual rather untidy football-
shaped structures and, considering the size of the birds, they had used some
unusually large twigs in the construction. The Bananaquits on this island
are a small very brightly coloured race and look very handsome. The other
birds seen building were the Yellow-faced Grassquits, which were building
everywhere. After the rainy season the grasses were growing well and would
be a valuable source of food when the young hatched.
The various warblers were seen for only a few brief moments. Both the
White-winged Dove Zenaida asiatica and the Mourning Dove Z. macroura
were quite common, as was the Palm Chat Dulus dominicus. The latter was
seen in small groups of six to eight birds which were quite active making a
communal nest.

As we all know Rothschild's Mynah Leucopsar rothschildi is a threatened
species which has only a limited distribution on the Indonesian island of
Bali. Although several reintroductions have already taken place, its status
in the wild remains very bleak (/ believe that the wild population is now
down to just 12 birds - Ed.). In captivity things look much brighter for this
species. A large number of private and public collections successfully breed
Rothschild's Mynahs and the captive population is quite stable. Even so
there are pairs which cause problems and one of these pairs is owned by a
friend of mine in Germany. He obtained a 'proven breeding pair' complete
with all the necessary documentation, and placed the birds first in a small
indoor aviary which was kept at a temperature of 15*C (59*F). Because it
was winter, the birds were kept inside until the end of April the following
year and then they were released in an outside flight measuring 2m x 4m x
2m high (approx.6ft 6in x 13ft x 6ft 6in high). Because his main goal was to
breed this rare species, no other birds were housed in the same flight. By
the end of May one of the birds was already flying around with nesting
material, which was taken to one of the two nest-boxes in the enclosure.
This box measured 25cm x 25cm x 40cm high (approx. 9 Ydn x 9 Vnn x
15 &apos;Ain high) and had a 6cm (2 Vzin) entrance hole.
On June 1st, the first egg was laid, followed a day later by the second
egg, the final one of the clutch. Hopes were high, but after seven days one
of the birds was observed at the end of the aviary eating something strange.
A closer inspection brought a big disappointment for one of the eggs had
become mynah food. An inspection of the nest-box revealed that the second
egg had also gone. The next clutch again consisting of two eggs was laid
three weeks later, but these too were also eaten after about seven days of
incubation.
The third clutch, again consisting of two eggs, was removed as soon as
it was complete and placed in the nest of a pair of Blackbirds Turdus merula
which were nesting in the garden of a friend of mine. After 14 days, which
is the normal incubation period for Rothschild's Mynah, both eggs were
found to be infertile. Was this, I wondered, why the birds had eaten their
eggs? The two eggs of the next clutch were, on inspection after five days,
found to be fertile, so the pair were given another chance to incubate them
themselves, but three days later all that remained of the eggs were some
shells at the end of the aviary. At the end of October, the birds were again
placed in the indoor enclosure and following the winter were, at the end of
April, put back in the outdoor aviary. After the first two eggs had again

been eaten by the parents, all the following eggs (four that year) were removed
and placed in Blackbirds' nests. Three of these eggs hatched but one chick
was lost when a cat visited the nest. At the age of 18 days, the remaining
two were taken out of the Blackbird's nest and raised by hand, which luckily
caused no problems. During 1997 a further four chicks were raised
successfully in this way.
I have heard of other pairs of Rothschild's Mynahs which eat their eggs,
but the reason why they do this remains unclear! My friend feeds his
Rothschild's Mynahs the same diet as his breeding pairs of Superb Starlings
Spreo superbus and Song Thrushes T. philomeos , both of which raise their
young without any problems.
Maarten de Ruiter lives in the Netherlands.
Daniel Shearing, who typesets the magazine, remembers his father, Arthur
Shearing who was Curator of Birds at Foxwarren Park from 1931 to 1956
and who was involved with the first breeding of these birds, telling him that
one of the secrets of breeding Rothschild s Mynahs is to supply far more
livefood than ever they could consume - and even then it is not assured that
they will not eat their eggs or become murderous. As far as he is aware the
procedure of removing the cock bird after copulation was never tried. Tom
Higton has told him that he (Tom) regularly used to place the eggs of
Leucopsar rothschildi under wild Starlings Sturnus vulgaris, with a degree
of success, using a similar procedure to that described here. - Ed,

THE YEAR AT BIRD WORLD

This year has produced a mixed bag of results generally here at Birdworld.
The breeding season has not been as prolific as most years but some of our
individual successes have made up for this. The unseasonably warm weather
during the winter, followed by the dramatic return of cold weather and frosts
in late spring and the subsequent wet summer put paid to the breeding season
of many of our regular and successful breeding pairs which always form the
backbone of our breeding year. The most obvious example of this is the
macaws, for this year we managed to breed only a solitary Scarlet Macaw
Am macao. However, other parrots such as the Umbrella Cacatua alba,
Goffin's C. goffini and Citron-crested Cockatoos C. sulphurea citrinocristata
and the Blue-fronted Amazons Amazona aestiva did well. They have
obviously adjusted better to the kind of weather that appears to be the norm
these days.

White-crested Touraco on nest
It has not been all doom and gloom. A high percentage of the touracos
and curassows which came to us at the end of 1997 have bred in their first
year here. The most notable of these being the Southern Helmeted Curassows
Pauxi unicornis unicornis and White-crested Touracos Tauraco leucolophus.

The White-crested Touracos laid eggs from May right through to September,
however, they failed at three attempts to rear their chicks past three weeks
old, as a result of which five were hand-reared, all of which have turned out
to be females. Other chicks hand-reared, included Black Crax alector ,
Yellow-knobbed C. daubentoni and Bare-faced Curassows C. fastiolata,
and Hartlaub's T. hartlaubi, Fischer's T.fischeri, Livingstone's T. livingstonii
and White-cheeked Touracos T. leucotis. The White-cheeked and
Livingstone's Touracos also reared their own young.
There have been a couple of species bred this year that, though not notable
in avicultural terms, are firsts for us at Birdworld, which makes them notable
for us. One was the breeding of the Beautiful or Crimson-capped Fruit
Dove Ptilinopuspulchellus. We got one pair late in 1997, and this year after
a few false starts the pair reared a chick in September. Unusually, they were
helped by a solitary male Blue-naped Mousebird Urocolius macrourus, which
helped them build the nest and brood the chick and, after the chick had
fledged, was even seen feeding it with pieces of fruit! Another first for
Birdworld was the rearing of a Crowned Crane Balearica regulorum
gibbericeps, which was hand-reared successfully without any leg problems.
Smew Mergus albellus were also hand-reared here for the first time.
We also had a couple of not quite but almosts. Our pair of White-eared
Catbirds Ailuroedus buccoides constructed a very makeshift nest by simply
lining a nest basket with wood chippings from the floor of the aviary. Three
yellowish, elongated eggs were laid on alternative days, but each was broken
almost immediately, however the female continued to sit on them. This
would have been a UK first, but was not to be, at least not this year. Maybe
we will be successful next year! Our Blue-faced Honeyeaters Entomyzon
cyanotis also made a nest and laid eggs for the first time, but they were
infertile.
There have also been many exciting new additions to the Birdworld
collection. Several single birds have been brought in to make up pairs with
existing birds, for example a male Emu Dromaius novaehollandiae, a female
Rhinoceros Hornbill Buceros rhinoceros , a male Toco Toucan Ramphastos
toco and female White-bellied Go-away Bird Corythaixoides leucogaster ,
all of which are doing very well with their new mates. Other new species for

housed in buildings adjacent to the Walter Rothschild Museum at Tring,
Hertfordshire was the venue for the Society's first outing of 1998. The
number was restricted to 20, and we were split into two groups. Firstly, we
were shown around the library by Mrs Warr, the Librarian. An impressive
selection of books was on display, including Edward Lear's famous book
on parrots and John Gould's Birds of New Guinea , Volume 1. The bookcases
contain a host of Gould's other works. This is where the most valuable
books are kept, including the great monographs from the last century. We
were then shown how the collectors meticulously logged their daily records
when in the field.
Mike Walters, who is. in charge of the egg collection, took over and
showed us around a room of specially designed cabinets. Ken Lawrence,
our Chairman, asked to see the eggs of Hildebrandt's Starling. He is trying
to breed this species and had read that the eggs are white, instead of blue
like those of most other starlings. Sure enough, there in a tray of eggs,
including those of the closely related Shelley's Starling which are blue, were
the white eggs of Hildebrandt's Starling standing out from the others. The
room which must be over 30m (almost 100ft) long, has cabinets along its
length containing cassowaries collected by Walter Rothschild, who thought
that because of their colour variations they were different races.
Josephine Cooper took us into a small room where the insides of birds
are removed leaving just the bones. The larvae of the Hide Beetle are used
for this task and we were shown examples of their work. A Sword-billed
Hummingbird, a Black Cockatoo and a Palm Cockatoo were among those
we examined. The Palm Cockatoo had come from George Smith, the well
known vet and a member of our Society. We were then shown skins of the
extinct Great Auk.
Dr Prys-Jones took us to see the cabinets containing jars in which the
internal organs of birds are kept in industrial methylated spirit. This particular
section is where birds sent in by aviculturists are used. It is important to
know the exact location in the wild where each bird was caught. As this is
usually unknown to avicultutists the specimens are used for research purposes
such as DNA analysis.
We were shown more bookcases full of books from more recent times.
It was explained that money spent on new books has to be justified. They
must contain new information and books with expensive colour plates are

rejected sometimes. We were shown the skin collection and chose a drawer
containing trogons and a cabinet with about ten Kakapos and also Blue-
throated Macaws. In response to a request from Raymond Sawyer, we were
shown examples of the Pink-headed Duck, one of which came from
Foxwarren Park, where Alfred Ezra, the Avicultural Society President at the
time and the father of our current President, Miss Ruth Ezra, had his
collection. It was sent to him from India by his brother Sir David Ezra.
Behind us on shelves holding numerous publications was what appeared to
be a complete set of the Avicultural Magazine from 1894 to the present
time, all of them bound in green cloth.
Our tour concluded, we then enjoyed the buffet lunch which had been
prepared for us. While we were altogether Ken Lawrence thanked the staff
for all their efforts on our behalf and Dr Prys-Jones took the opportunity to
say that they are still very keen to receive birds at Tring as they have only
single specimens of some species, whereas they have hundreds of specimens
of others. Dead birds should be sent by first class post to:- Ornithology
Department, The Natural History Museum, Akeman Street, Tring,
Hertfordshire HP23 6AP.
After lunch we viewed the exhibits in the Walter Rothschild Museum,
which is open to the general public. We saw many birds no longer available
which brought back memories for some of the older members present, who
had kept and bred them in years past. A glass cabinet displays a large selection
of hummingbirds, most of which are staged to show to best advantage their
wonderful iridescent plumage.
If individual members wish to visit the museum for a particular purpose,
such as to examine bird skins, this can be arranged by telephoning 01442

A GUIDE TO ... PHEASANTS &amp; WATERFOWL
I enjoyed reviewing this latest addition to Australian Birdkeeping
Publications' expanding range of avicultural works. It is an eminently practical
volume much of the content obviously based on author, Dr Danny Brown's
own experiences with these two groups of birds so that his views and
recommendations will be of value and interest to experienced owners and
beginners alike. He has also sought information from many other expert sources
in Australia and the USA and the outcome is a very comprehensive book of
some 250 pages which is well illustrated with colour photographs and line
drawings. The text is informative and accurate with practical aspects of the
birds' husbandry well to the fore throughout.
The limited availability of non-indigenous species in Australia has
inevitably led to the exclusion of many which are widely kept in other parts of
the world, but this does not detract from the book's value...instead subjects
are dealt with more comprehensively! There are 30 waterfowl and 13
gallinaceous species, the latter -including Red Junglefowl, Blue and Green
Peafowl, guineafowl and Chukar Partridge. Among the first group are Magpie
and Cape Barren Geese, various shelduck. Grey and Chestnut Teal, Pacific
Black Duck, Pink-eared Duck, Freckled Duck, Green and Cotton Pygmy
Geese. Pheasants are mainly those well known in aviculture such as Golden,
Silver, Lady Amherst, Swinhoe, Nepal Kalij and Siamese Fireback.
Information about individual species is generally detailed and informative.
Starting with common and scientific names, synonyms and descriptions
(including size and weight), the rest is marshalled under separate sub-headings
and covers distribution and habitat, descriptions of hatchlings, races, sexing,
housing, feeding, breeding,, mutations, hybrids, longevity and status.
The book is divided into four main chapters under the headings General
Management, Common Diseases and Disorders, Waterfowl, and Pheasants
with up to five pages of text and photographs devoted to each species. I
particularly like the first two chapters where much sound advice and quite a
few innovative ideas are on offer - and although presumably written mainly
for enthusiasts down under, many are worthy of consideration and adaptation
by people who keep these birds in many other parts of the world. The chapter
dealing with diseases, injuries and associated problems reflects the author's
ability to combine knowledge of the subject with the skill of a good
communicator.
Thus a variety of health problems ranging from parasitic and viral diseases,
bacterial and fungal infections to egg-eating and cannibalism are discussed,
and treatments or preventative measures recommended. A useful feature is

the identification and recommended dosages of various treatments (mainly
against proprietary brand names), although the author emphasises many may
be available only against veterinary prescription.
This is an excellent book which will be of value and interest not only to
Australian birdkeepers but to both professionals and hobbyists who live or
work many a mile from Queensland where Dr Danny Brown is at present

Park), Beerwah, the Southbank Butterfly House and Wildlife Sanctuary, South

PITTAS OF THE WORLD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9112103" page_id="56285930"  page_num="136" year="" vol="">
Pittas of the World, A Monograph of the Pitta Family by Johannes Erritzoe
and Helga Boullet Erritzoe is a must for everyone interested in these birds. It
is so jam-packed with information about pittas that it is difficult to believe
that there are any remaining known facts about these birds which have not
been included in this new monograph.
Thirty species are recognised. As well as the English and scientific names,
the French, German and Italian names of each species are listed, also other
English names and synonyms used in recognised papers since 1893-1895,
following the publication of the second edition of Elliot's monograph of this
family. The male and female, or simply the adult (many species show marked
sexual dimorphism, others show only minor differences between the sexes,
while the remaining 14 species are sexually monomorphic), nestling, juvenile
and immature of each species are, if known, described in considerable detail
(the nestlings, juveniles and immatures of some species remain undescribed/
unknown). There follows, in several instances, a list of publications in which
can be found photographs of living examples of the species. Races (sub-species)
are dealt with under the heading Museum Diagnosis.
Other headings under which each species is dealt with include Distribution,

of pittas, the authors were struck by the fact that the majority of specimens
were collected before the Second World War. They do not discuss whether
this is because there were more collectors operating then, or whether it is
because since then there has been such a catastrophic acceleration in the
destruction of lowland rainforest, which is the predominant habitat of these
birds. The rarest species are Schneider's Pitta and Gurney's Pitta both of
which are probably close to extinction.
Much is made of the dusky streaking which apparently is often present,
particularly on the upperparts of many museum specimens of pittas (out of a
total of 2,130, 38.6% of males and 33.2% of females had dusky streaking).
There are two photographs clearly showing 'typical' examples of heavy dusky
streaking on the wing-coverts, mantle and back of specimens of the Indian
Pitta. I must say that I cannot recall ever having seen this dusky streaking on
captive specimens of any pittas, which may perhaps lend support to the
suggestion that this could be a feature of these species' nuptial plumage.
Aviculturists are likely to be especially interested in the references to
the keeping of pittas in captivity. Here, however, the authors had difficulty
finding published information about the keeping of many of the species and,
therefore, the coverage is fairly patchy. As the Avicultural Magazine was
among their main reference sources and in view of their obvious thoroughness
it is surprising that there is no mention of the breeding of the Indian (Bengal)
Pitta in 1961 in Edward Marshall Boehm's aviaries in the USA, or of the
Blue-winged Pitta in 1972 at the Wildfowl Trust, Slimbridge, here in the UK,
both of which were reported in this magazine. One suspects that some at least
of their comments on the subject of keeping pittas are coloured by their
observation in the introduction that: 'Many papers indicate that pittas are
difficult birds to keep alive in captivity...'!
Each of the 30 species is illustrated by a full-page (297mm x 210mm)
colour plate painted by Helga Boullet Erritzoe, which in many instances show
the male and female and juvenile or immature. There are two other colour
plates by Helga Boullet Erritzoe, one of which shows the eggs of various
pittas. I would particularly like to have seen the photo of the Sula Pitta (a race
of the Red-bellied species) and of the Superb Pitta in colour, but disappointingly,
none of the photos are reproduced in colour. There are also numerous maps,
tables and a few line drawings.

BIRDLAND APPOINTMENT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99892247826087" page_id="56285932"  page_num="138" year="" vol="">
One of Britain's best known bird gardens, Birdland Park at Bourton-on-
the-Water, Gloucestershire, has a new man in charge. He is Simon Blackwell
who has been appointed Park Director. Prior to this he was on the staff of
the Cotswold Wildlife Park for 20 years, latterly as Assistant Curator. Simon
told Frank Woolham that he regards his appointment as '...a great challenge'
and is looking forward to helping restore Birdland to its former position as
one of Britain's premier bird collections. Seven acres (almost three hectares)
of woodland, gardens, rivers and ponds already provide a delightful, tranquil
setting, and with a further 40 acres (just over 16 hectares) of land available
there is obvious scope for further development.
One of his first priorities will be to address the presentation of both
gardens and exhibits. He plans to review existing stock at the end of 1998
with a view to widening representative presentation, and intends to work
closely with appropriate TAGs and EEPs on breeding programmes. Initial
plans for 1999 include a new graphic label system, educational programmes,
an adoption scheme and a guide book.
&apos;Reactions from visitors to Birdland are generally very good - and the
overall view is that people enjoy the experience', said Simon. 'Now we
need to increase the length of time people spend here and we anticipate
achieving this by means of some of the foregoing ideas as well as new
interactive projects'. He also intends to bring Birdland back into the active
zoo community and sees the park's large, but at present unused, quarantine
centre as perhaps having a cooperative role to play in this direction.

In Cage &amp; Aviary Birds (October 10th issue), UK softbill enthusiast
Bob Beeson described breeding the Orange-flanked Bush Robin Erithacus
cyanurus , Japanese Robin E. akahige and Rufous-tailed Robin E. sibilans.
The first species reared three young, the second four young and the third
three young. The author thinks one of the secrets of his success is that he
removed the males on the day the chicks hatched, leaving the females to
rear the young on their own without any interference from their partners.
The same issue included an item about the pair of Tarictic Hornbills
Penelopides panini at Linton Zoo, Cambridgeshire, which since 1993, have

By mid-June chicks from 120 species had been reared to independence
or to the fledging stage at Loro Parque, Tenerife. Three pairs of Hoffmann's
Conures Pyrrhura hoffmanni had chicks and the Rose-crowned Conures P.
rhodocephala had laid for the first time. The eggs were transferred to a pair
of Green-cheeked Conures P. molinae, which are reliable parents, and which
duly hatched all three eggs. Blue-headed Macaws Ara couloni had laid for
the first time, but the incubation of the eggs was still at the early stage.
Pesquet's Parrots Psittrichas fulgidus had produced two successful
clutches, and other species which had been successful included Gang-gang
Cockatoos Callocephalon fimbriatum , Horned Parrakeets Eunymphicus
cornutus , Green-winged King Parrots Alisterus chloropterus moszkowskii ,
three races of Eclectus Parrot Eclectus roratus polychloros, E. r. vosmaeri
and E. r. solomonensis , Philippine Hanging Parrots Loriculus galgulus. Blue-
throated Macaws A. glaucogularis, Red-fronted Macaws A. rubrogenys. Red-
spectacled Amazons Amazona pretrei , Bodin's Amazons A. festiva bodini
and Purple-bellied Parrots Triclaria malachitacea.
At the end of March, 117 King Penguin Aptenodytes patagonicus eggs
and a chick hatched on the journey from South Georgia arrived at Loro
Parque. The eggs had been collected from colonies at Royal Bay and St.
Andrew's Bay and had been laid too late in the season for the chicks to
survive the rapidly approaching southern winter. On arrival at Loro Parque,
the eggs were immediately transferred from the travelling incubator to two
specially modified incubators. The average measurement of the eggs was
110mm x 74mm and the average weight was 328g. Seventy of them hatched
and the 71 chicks (including the chick hatched during the journey) were
being fed on squid, herring, krill and a specially formulated supplement
which included multi-vitamins and calcium. Nine died from various causes
during the initial rearing period. A house is currently being built for them,
which should be open to visitors by next spring.

In 1981, Vogelpark Walsrode in Germany received 11 young Oriental
White Storks Ciconia boyciana as part of a cooperative breeding programme.
The first breeding in captivity occurred in 1987, since when more than 30
have been bred there. Others have been bred in zoos in China and Japan.
Recently seven young storks hatched and reared at Walsrode were sent
to the captive breeding centre at the National University of Education in
South Korea. Their offspring will be released in suitable habitat in South
Korea, where this species last bred in 1971. It is thought a few pairs may
continue to breed in North Korea.
The biologist from Korea, who will be responsible for the captive
management programme, will be trained at Walsrode. He will be trained
not just in keeping and breeding storks, but also herons, egrets and spoonbills;
for the rare Black-faced Spoonbill Platalea minor and Chinese or Swinhoe's
Egret Egretta eulophotes are also part of this conservation project in South
Korea, supported by the Brehm Fund in Germany. This and the projects
which are the subjects of the following two items are described in Flying

A cooperation agreement has been reached between the Brehm Fund
and the National Parks Authority on the island of New Caledonia, giving
the go-ahead for studies of the Kagu Rhyhochetos jubatus and other rare
and threatened birds of this French overseas territory. A captive breeding
programme for the Kagu started in 1977 at the Parc Zoologique et Forestier
in Noumea, the capital of New Caledonia, had up until 1994, reared 61
Kagus. Now, a new reserve is going to be established, into which captive
reared Kagus will be released and where the number of dogs, the Kagu's
main predator, and cats will be kept as low as possible.
The Horned Parrakeet Eunymphicus cornutus cornutus and New
Caledonian Red-fronted Parrakeet Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae saisseti ,
along with the Crow or Red-faced Honeyeater Gymnomyza aubryana, will
also be the subjects of detailed field studies intended to form the basis for
conservation programmes. Field workers will also keep a sharp look-out
for the New Caledonian Forikeet Charmosyna diadema , known only from
two female specimens (one since lost) collected before 1860.
Ouvea, one of the Royalty group of islands east of New Caledonia, is the

parrakeets. At an international workshop held there in 1996, plans were
made to protect its habitat, control the number of goats and prevent the
accidental introduction of rats on to the island and, through a public awareness
campaign, reduce the number of young parrakeets taken from nests or stop
this entirely. It was also planned to survey several islands off the coast of
New Caledonia to assess their suitability for the introduction of a back-up
population. Unfortunately, these measures have not been fully implemented
due to the lack of personnel and funds, and a further decline seems inevitable.

Shoebills Balaeniceps rex rarely succeed in rearing both their chicks.
Therefore, the Brehm Fund is supporting a programme aimed at increasing
their numbers in Uganda by collecting and artificially rearing the second
chicks. This will be done at the Wildlife Education Centre, which has been
established in the grounds of the former Entebbe Zoological Gardens.
The most difficult and costly part of the programme will be tracking
down the birds' widely scattered nest sites in large tracts of papyrus and
miscanthidium swamp. This will be done using micro-light aircraft to locate
and monitor the nests, so that the chicks can be collected from the nests
three to ten days after they have hatched. To guard against the birds becoming
imprinted, they will be fed using Shoebil 1-head puppets and will be walked
by keepers dressed to look like Shoebills. They will be trained to catch
lungfish, the Shoebilks favourite food.
Prior to being released in suitable habitat, the young Shoebills will be
fitted with radio transmitters so that their progress can be monitored. If the
programme is a success in Uganda, the same techniques may be used in
other African countries such as Sudan and Zambia.

SECOND CHANCE FOR HAWK EAGLES

<bodyText confidence="0.9771525" page_id="56285935"  page_num="141" year="" vol="">
An innovative joint project between Pretoria Zoo and the Transvaal
Museum is now underway in South Africa, with the object of giving a new
lease of life to young African Hawk Eagles Hieraaetus spilogaster which
would almost certainly die before fledging in the wild. As is the case with
other raptor species, there is usually a difference of several days in the ages
of the chicks and this invariably results in the death of the younger bird
which is unable to compete for food with its stronger sibling. In the case of
the African Hawk Eagle the older chick kills the younger one.
Project head, Dr Alan Kemp said that after the first chick hatches, the
remaining egg is removed from nests in the Kruger National Park and brought

to Pretoria Zoo where incubation is completed. Three chicks are at present
being hand-reared at the zoo and when they are old enough they will be
released into suitable wild locations in the Northern Province. Dr Kemp
explained that in addition to supplementing the species' population, the
project, which is funded by the Foundation for Research Development, also
results in other benefits including generation of much-needed funds in the
local community whose members assist in monitoring nests and retrieving
eggs. Students from historically disadvantaged universities are being trained
in hand-rearing techniques for the birds, while two students from the
University of Venda are receiving training from one of the zoo's
conservationists.

DULCIE COOKE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995554525" page_id="56285937"  page_num="143" year="" vol="">
I was shocked and saddened at the recent meeting of the Society at Leeds
Castle, to learn of the death of Dulcie Cooke only a few weeks previously. I
first met her more than twenty years ago when she invited me to see her
birds and aviaries. She and her husband, Freddie, lived in a small suburban
house close to the Epsom Downs. Their garden was a delight with attractive
aviaries surrounding a perfect lawn with beautiful flower beds. At that time
the aviaries housed Cockatiels only. It was obvious that Dulcie's life was
devoted to her birds. She was inclined to anthropomorphise about them
frequently which I found slightly irritating until I began to realise that it was
just a reflection of how much she loved them. Her husband, Freddie, was
wonderfully co-operative devoting most of his time in retirement to
constructing and maintaining appropriately designed aviaries and keeping
the garden in perfect order while she gave almost her entire attention to the
birds. She and Freddie developed an authoritative knowledge which they
were always prepared to share with other aviculturists and which was evident
in their first book Keeping Cockatiels.
Dulcie had lived for a while in Australia where, not surprisingly, she
was fascinated by the wonderful birds particularly the Eastern and Crimson
Rosellas and Red-rumped Parrakeets which visited her garden. Perhaps it
was these memories which stimulated her to give up Cockatiels of which
she had developed a strain of magnificent specimens, for other more colourful
Australian Parrakeets. She was very successful with Splendid and
Turquoisine Parrakeets when the grass parrakeets (. Neophema ) were rare
and expensive but she was one of the few parrakeet breeders at that time
whose interest appeared not to be in making money. King Parrakeets also
bred well in her aviaries but to her immense disappointment, the closely
related Moskowski's Green-winged Kings, about which she wrote in the
Avicultural Magazine, subsequently fared disastrously. Eclectus Parrots,
on the other hand, did quite well but were inclined to desert their eggs or
abandon their chicks. This stimulated interest in artificial incubation and
hand-rearing into which Dulcie and Freddie threw themselves with reckless
abandon! I used to visit Dulcie two or three times a year and never ceased
to be amazed by the amount of time, care and effort she gave to maintaining
what had grown into a fairly large parrakeet collection. The aviaries were
spotlessly clean and tidy and the birds always appeared to be in perfect
condition. I have no idea how she and her husband found time to write
another book entitled Popular Parrakeets based on their considerable
practical experience. A big change in Dulcie's avicultural activities occurred
about ten years ago when she acquired a pair of Green-naped Lorikeets.
She was so enamoured with them that, for reasons incomprehensible to me,

she sold all her Australian parrakeets to concentrate on lories and lorikeets.
This involved some modifications to the outdoor aviaries and the adaptation
of a spare bedroom to include small aviaries for delicate species. She was
remarkably successful with the Obi Lory, a rare race of Eos squamata, which
has now become quite common in aviculture probably as a result of her
initial efforts. However, she appeared to derive most pleasure from species
of the genus Charmosyna of which she bred many Pleasing and Red-spotted
Lorikeets in her heated indoor enclosures. There were also several pairs of
the magnificent Stella's Lorikeet in the outdoor aviaries. Lories and lorikeets
are notoriously difficult to keep clean and maintaining a big collection is
very time consuming because of the gummy nature of their copious
droppings. However Dulcie's devotion to her birds, which had become
almost an obsession, continued to give her enough energy to maintain the
collection meticulously. A few years ago Freddie died. Dulcie carried on
alone but inevitably missed his stalwart support and had to part with all of
her birds except her aged Shama which, with its song and beauty, had given
her years of pleasure and enchantment. For a while she found a new, active
and happy life in a marriage to another husband who died only a few weeks
before she did.
I remember well and with great gratitude how helpful and co-operative
she was when I was Editor of the Avicultural Magazine. I used to spend
much of my time on the telephone or writing letters in attempts to persuade
members to write for the magazine. My efforts were usually accompanied
by a conspicuous lack of success. But Dulcie Cooke always considered my
requests carefully and, if she agreed, promised to deliver copy by a specific
date, which she did. Members of the Society will remember other ways in
which she was helpful and co-operative with a charming and gracious manner.
She was a sweet and kindly lady who will be sadly missed.

One of the most significant ornithological discoveries in New Zealand
this century occurred on November 9th 1997, when a team searching for
Campbell Island Teal Anas acklandica nesiotis on Jacquermart Island, caught
a snipe and saw seven others. Jacquemart Island is a 19 hectare (approx. 49
acre) island off Campbell Island, a subantarctic island south of New Zealand.
Up until this time, there was no evidence that snipe occurred in the Campbell
Island group. By 1840, rats on Campbell Island had eliminated the now

Zealand Snipe Coenocorypha aucklandica, which has surviving populations
on the Snares, Auckland and Antipodes Islands. During the search the dogs'
behaviour indicated the presence of at least ten snipe on the island. Given
the amount of suitable habitat, there could be up to 60 individuals living on
the island but the total population is likely to be far fewer than this.
Captive breeding at the New Zealand Department of Conservation's Mt.
Bruce National Wildlife Centre has played an important role in saving a
number of endangered New Zealand bird species. Therefore, one of the
options being considered to assist in the future recovery of the newly
discovered Campbell Island Snipe is captive breeding, with the aim of
providing sufficient birds for reintroduction to Campbell Island following
the proposed eradication of the island's rats. The plan would be to run
surrogate breeding programmes using more numerous snipe species in order
to gain expertise in the husbandry of Coenocorypha snipe. These would be
the Chatham Island Snipe Coenocorypha pusilla, followed by the Auckland
Island Snipe. The proven avicultural techniques would then be applied to
the Campbell Island Snipe. The initial plan is to bring into captivity three
known pairs and 12 wild-laid eggs of the Chatham Island Snipe. The eggs
will allow us to gain experience of artificial incubation of snipe eggs and
hand-rearing snipe chicks to independence. Once adult birds begin to lay,
the first clutches will be lifted for artificial incubation and the second clutch
left with the adults.
One previous attempt was made to hold Chatham Island Snipe in captivity,
this was in 1988, but all eight adult birds were lost due to stress and
aspergillosus. However, a number of factors have changed in the last ten
years that should increase the likelihood of successfully maintaining and
breeding snipe in captivity:-
improved methods of transport for birds and eggs
Better disease management
Commercial supplies of insects now available
Detailed research reports on snipe feeding and breeding ecology
Experienced avicultural staff at Mt. Bruce
Some of the avicultural questions which need to be answered are: -
Methods of settling the birds into captivity and on to captive diets
Captive diets and methods of presentation
Aviary size and landscape
Breeding, behaviour nutritional requirements etc.

I would like to request international assistance from anybody with
experience of the captive husbandry of snipe (i.e. Gallinago species) or
even species such as godwits and whimbrel, as they could also provide
avicultural information applicable to snipe. Alternatively, should anybody
have knowledge of an aviculturist or institution with such knowledge, or of
any possible reference material on the subject, their contact details would
be invaluable. Any information, advice or contact details would be greatly
appreciated and should be sent me at the address given below. I will undertake

The first breeding records for Coraciiformes and Piciformes bred in
the UK were listed recently by Coles (1996). Some of these species had
previously been bred in Germany and additional species of barbets
(Capitonidae) and toucans (Ramphastidae) have also been bred successfully
in Germany and Austria. As these records are not generally known I have
compiled the following account.
Barbets
Black-spotted Barbets Capito niger kept at Frankfurt Zoo bred there
first in 1965. A youngster hatched June 23rd and*fledged July 28th 1965
(Faust, 1969). Orange-fronted Barbets C. squamatus bred there for the first
time in 1987, when four young left the nesting hole; in 1987 and 1988
altogether nine young were reared (Stadler, 1992).
Red-headed Barbets Eubucco bourcierii nested at Frankfurt for the first
time in February 1967, but it was not until later the same year that they were
successful, when two young were hatched, one of which was reared
successfully and left the nest after 31 days (Faust, 1969). Three more Red-
headed Barbets were reared there in 1973. Toucan Barbets Semnornis
ramphastinus bred at Frankfurt Zoo for the first time in 1972. The same
year that this species bred successfully at Winged World in England (Coles,
1996).
Pied Barbets Tricholaema leucomelan were bred at Heidelberg Zoo,
Germany as early as January 1973, when two young hatched and were reared
successfully. They left the nest when they were 32 days old (Poley, 1973).
The Pied Barbet was bred in the UK for the first time in 1983 by B. Peck.
The Double-toothed Barbets Lybius bidentatus received by Frankfurt Zoo
in March 1966 bred there for the first time during May 1966. Between then
and 1969 these barbets bred there nine times and hatched 18 young, 15 of
which were reared successfully (Faust, 1969). During their fifth nesting, in
April 1967, the pair were closely observed and it was noted that the male
stayed in the nest for periods of only five to ten minutes, whereas the female
remained inside for periods of an hour or so. On the 14th day both adults
were seen to take food to the nest. Two or three days later young ones from
the previous brood were also observed taking food to the nestlings. The
latter were seen at the nest hole for the first time on the 29th day. The older
one left the nest on the 37th day, and the second on the following day. The
young barbets were fed mostly with insects but also with fruit and green

salad. In seven of the nests two young were reared each time and once three
young left the nest (in October 1968).
The Bearded Barbet L. dubius was bred at Heidelberg Zoo in Germany
for the first time in 1988 and was bred there again in 1989; one youngster
was reared successfully on both occasions. No further details are available
on the breeding of this species at Heidelberg. Also in 1989, a male and
three females were bred at San Diego Wild Animal Park (. International Zoo
Yearbook , 30,1991:407). Bearded Barbets have been kept only irregularly
here in Austria. A pair that had been living in the aviaries of an avicultutist
for about three years was later acquired by Karl Lindmayer of Vocklabruck
(Upper Austria) in 1996, who bred them successfully. Two white eggs were
laid late in April 1997; on May 14th one chick was noted for the first time
and the next day another one had hatched. Both left the nest on July 25th
1997 by which time they already looked similar to the adults (Fuchs, 1998).
Unfortunately the breeding pair and the young died recently (Fuchs per.
comm.).
A pair of Brown-breasted Barbets L. melanoptems acquired by Berlin
Zoo in 1992, bred there late in December of the same year; three young
hatched and were reared successfully. The pair bred again in 1994, nesting
three times; and of the eight young only one failed to survive (Reinhardt,
1994; see also Annual Report of the Berlin Zoo, Bongo 25, 1995: 78). The
barbets bred in 1992 were sent to Schonbmnn Zoo, Vienna on September
20th 1993 where they have been housed in a smaller aviary in the Bird
House. Here the birds bred in December 1993, when two young hatched
and were reared successfully. In 1994 the pair bred again in March, June
and August, and four young were reared. Early in 1995 the birds bred again
and reared two more young. It was noted that the two barbets bred in 1993
(together with their parents) took turns feeding the young of the next brood
(Dr Dagmar Schratter, Curator of Birds, Schonbmnn Zoo per. comm.).
The Naked-faced Barbet Gymnobucco calvus was bred in 1996 at
Vogelpark Metelen, Germany. A pair received by this well-known bird park
In January 1995 bred there successfully in the early summer of 1996. On
this occasion three young were reared which left the nest August 18th 1996.
Only three days later they were observed taking food by themselves but
were also continuing to be fed by their parents. At the beginning of September
the young birds had to be removed from the aviary when the pair bred again.
On this occasion only one youngster was reared which was seen outside the
nesting hole for the first time on November 25th 1996. Early in 1997 the
Naked-faced Barbets started to breed again (Stahl, 1998).
Tinkerbirds are bred in captivity only rarely. The Speckled TInkerbird
Pogoniulus scolopaceus was bred at Frankfurt Zoo for the first time in 1985.
In the following years, 23 young were reared there (Stadler, 1992). In the

UK Yellow-fronted Tinkerbirds P. chrysoconus were bred for the first time
in 1995. The Blue-throated Barbet Megalaima asiatica was bred for the
first time in 1979, at the Max-Planck-Institut fur Verhaltensphysiologie in
Seewiesen, Germany (Sonnenschein, 1980). Only one young hatched, this
was on or about August 2nd 1979 and it was reared by the male after the
female died suddenly during the third week after it hatched. It was seen
outside the nest hole for the first time on September 3rd 1979 and looked
like the adult, only slightly paler. Only 11 days later it was seen feeding
itself. Unfortunately, it died three weeks after leaving the nest and was
probably killed by the adult. No UK breeding records for species of the
Asian genus Megalaima are listed by Coles (1996). In the USA the Gaudy
Barbet M. mystacophanos was bred in 1994 at Fort Worth and Toledo
(International Zoo Yearbook , 35:410).
Toucans
The first breeding of toucans occurred at the famous bird park at Walsrode,
Germany, where the Red-breasted Toucan Ramphastos dicolorus was bred
in 1967, when four young were hatched and reared (Brehm, 1968). In 1983
Sulphur-breasted Toucans R. sulfuratus of the nominate race were bred at
Wuppertal Zoo, Germany. Two young left the nesting hole on the 42nd day
after hatching and the 45th day respectively (Schtirer, 1985). The Sulphur-
breasted Toucan had been bred before only at Houston Zoo, USA. In 1986
the Toco Toucan R. toco was bred at Wuppertal Zoo. Only one youngster
hatched, on June 17th, which left the nest 44 days afterwards (Schtirer, 1987).
In Great Britain the Toco Toucan was bred for the first time in 1987 at
Ocean World/Linton Zoo (Coles, 1996). Generally toucans are bred more
regularly in zoos in the USA, than they are in Europe. The International
Zoo Yearbook , Volume 34, listed eight species which were bred there
successfully in 1993, whereas only two species were bred in Europe.

BREEDING THE SOUTHERN HELMETED CURASSOW
AT BIRDWORLD

Here at Birdworld, up until 1997, we had very little experience of keeping
curassows, we had only ever had a pair of Bare-faced Curassows Crax
fasciolata and they had never laid. Then in November 1997 we were thrown
in at the deep end with the arrival of several pairs of curassows, including a
pair of Southern Helmeted Curassows Pauxi unicornis unicornis and a pair
of Northern Helmeted Curassows P. pauxi pauxi.
Curassows belong to the family Cracidae, one of the more primitive
families of the Order Galliformes which includes Megapodes, Turkeys,
Grouse, Quail, Pheasants, Partridge and Guineafowl. Within the Order
Galliformes, the Cracids are lumped with the Megapodes in the suborder
Craci, while all the other families are grouped together in the suborder
Phasiani. Both Megapodes and Cracids are highly distinctive and of ancient
origin, and have many anatomical similarities. They are quite distant from
the Phasiani in that, for example, they do not hybridize with birds of other
families, they are largely arboreal and they lay relatively small clutches of
usually two, but at most four eggs. The family Cracidae is further split into
two subfamilies, Penelopinae (Guans and Chachalacas) and Cracinae
(Curassows). All this is fairly complicated, but in the case of the helmeted
curassows gets even more so in that their taxonomy is a matter of dispute
and they are classified differently by different authorities. Some continue to
place them in the genus Crax , though most authorities, including those
responsible for the Handbook of the Birds of the World , are of the opinion
that they should be in their own genus, Pauxi. On top of which there are
those who continue to claim that both helmeted curassows are races of the
same species, whereas most believe they should be split into two separate
species.
When the Southern Helmeted Curassow was first described in the 1930s,
it was classified as a separate species from the Northern Helmeted Curassow.
Though they look similar, their casques differ in shape, the latter having a
swollen, rounded casque, whereas the Southern has an elongated, cylindrical
casque. However, new races of both species described later have different
shaped casques to those of their nominate forms. It was thought therefore
that the different shaped casques were simply regional differences, and that
both curassows should be lumped together as a single species. Since then
other morphological differences have come to light and the Southern
Helmeted Curassow's tightly-curled, glossy crest has helped reinforce the
idea that they should be treated as two separate species.

The Southern Helmeted Curassow is split into two races, P. u. unicornis
and P. u. koepekeae . They differ from each other in that P u. koepekeae has
a shorter helmet or casque which slopes further backwards, and it also has
less white on the tip of its tail P u. unicornis , the race we have, inhabits
dense lower montane forest on the eastern slopes of the Andes in central and
north-eastern Bolivia, It feeds mainly on fallen fruits though apparently the
fallen nuts of the almond tree also form a large part of its diet, along with
some foliage. It feeds mostly at first and last light, but will also feed during
the night when there is light from the moon. Nests are rarely found, but
seem to be constructed like those of other curassow species, Le. they consist
of substantial structures of sticks placed about 5m (approx. 16ft) up in trees,
usually in a fork. Two, or often only one creamy white egg with a slightly
chalky texture make up the clutch. The Southern Helmeted Curassow is
thought to be vulnerable/rare, though the true situation is probably worse
than this as very little is known about Its status in the wild. It is threatened
mainly by professional hunters, and is also hunted by local people for its
meat and its helmet, which is used to make necklaces for important native
dances. Also, and more crucially, illegal timber extraction and burning of
its native forest still goes on to a large extent.
Our pair of birds are kept in an aviary approx. 12ft square x 10ft high at
the front and 8ft at the back (about 3.6m square x 3m high at the front and
2.4m at the back). The birds also have a 4ft (approx, 1.2m) square night
shelter, which is 7ft (approx. 2.1m) high at the front and 6ft (approx. 1.8m)
high at the back, with a light and a ceramic heat bulb attached to a thermostat
set at about 7*C (44 6*F). The roof of the night shelter is covered over, as it
was the curassows' favourite place to perch. Their diet consists of pheasant
pellets mixed with wheat, a few mealworms and a large quantity of grapes,
apple, pear, banana, tomato, soaked raisins, kiwi fruit, marrowfat peas,
unsoaked currants and cooked rice. They do not get any mince or other
meat as, like other fragivorous birds such as touracos and toucans, they are
prone to getting iron storage disease. They do though get a small amount of
Witte Molen Fruit Softbill Food and a special supplement mix intended
specificially for fruit-eaters is sprinkled on the fruit. A large, straw-filled
rectangular wooden nest-box with deep sides is provided inside the night
shelter. This is largely ignored, however; only one pair of our curassows
has laid in the nest-box. Most pairs, including the Southern Helmeted
Curassows, have chosen to lay their eggs on the roof of the night shelter.
Most seem to do so without any attempt to make a nest, but usually lay their
egg at the spot where they perch, almost as if the egg has been laid as an
afterthought. This created a problem as, because the shelter roofs are sloping,
the eggs were generally laid at the high point and rolled down to the bottom
where they smashed against the side of the aviary. This was solved by

putting a thick layer of straw along the edge of the roof.
The Southern Helmeted Curassow laid her first egg on June 20th 1998.
Like the other curassows she laid it on the roof of the night shelter without
any discernible nest having been made in the straw. This egg was removed
for artificial incubation. Almost all of the different curassow eggs, because
of the dramatic amount of weight they lost, needed the highest humidity
achievable in the incubator and most also needed varnishing. All were
incubated at 99*F (37.5*C). Having put the Southern Helmeted Curassow
egg in the incubator running at its maximum, on the 5th day however, it had
to be moved to 80*F (26.7*C) (wet bulb), as it was not losing enough weight.
By the 5th day the egg was seen to be fertile and had achieved vein growth
to the end of the egg by the 11th day. Unfortunately, just after this the egg
died. The clutch had contained just the single egg. The next egg was laid
on July 27th; again, no second egg was laid. In fact, with all four eventual
clutches, only one egg was laid each time. This was also found to be true
with the Northern Helmeted Curassows, whereas all the other curassow
species laid two eggs per clutch. The Southern Helmeted Curassow egg
was again removed for incubation, this time at 80*F (26.7*C)(wet bulb).
Conversely, this time the egg had to be moved to maximum humidity on the
5th day as it was losing too much weight. When an egg dies at about this
time, it can be for one of several reasons, e.g. an infectious disease, incorrect
turning, too high or too low a temperature during incubation, or a fault with
the parent stock. We ruled out temperature irregularities, as the incubator
had run at the correct temperature all through incubation. We also ruled out
an infectious disease, as both eggs were incubated with other eggs, with
which there had been no problems. So, crossing our fingers and hoping that
we did not have a problem with the adult birds, we decided that the turning
of the egg could be at fault. Both previous eggs had been on rollers which
turned very slowly and constantly at about 24 revolutions per day. They
were also turned end to end by hand seven times a day. When the next egg
was laid on August 6th, it was originally put on rollers at maximum humidity,
but on the 5th day was moved to 80*F (26.7*C), as again it was not losing
enough weight. This time it was put in an incubator with tilting trays which
turned the egg 45 degrees every hour in one quick movement. It was also
turned by hand seven times a day. This time the egg got past the growth to
end stage and continued growing healthily, reaching full vein growth on the
16th day. It continued doing well until it reached the stage when it should
pip internally, at which point it died.
One more egg was laid, this was on August 30th. This egg was put straight
onto tilting trays at 80*F (26.7*C)(wet bulb) and grew healthily this time
right up to hatching. The egg pipped internally on the 29th day, and hatched
on the 32nd day. As is usual with curassow eggs, the chick did not pip

through the egg shell until quite late, and then smashed its way out very
quickly by kicking, instead of pipping all the way round the top of the egg
and then pushing out, even though when it hatched it had an egg tooth. The
chick was covered in downy fluff with pin feathers on the wings like those
of a pheasant chick. It was rufous brown on the back, with darker brown
markings, and buff underneath. There was no sign of the helmet and the

Southern Helmeted Curassow chick at one day old
beak was shorter and more downward curved compared to that of other
curassow chicks we have hatched, and was black and pink in colour. Its
wing feathers grew rapidly from this point on and were black like those of
the adults, while elsewhere it retained its downy fluff and the same coloration.
By the time the chick was one month old, a bluish lump was starting to
become discernible on the top of the beak.
Curassow chicks are very easy to hand-rear. They are fed on the same
diet as the parents except that the fruit is cut-up smaller, the pheasant pellets
and wheat are replaced with chick crumbs for the first week, and mealworms
are fed in small quantities morning and evening. Mealworms are taken with
relish and care has to be taken that they are not fed too many. For the first

couple of days the chicks are encouraged to take their food from tweezers
but after the third day feed themselves. They are provided with heat for
only about the first ten days, and then moved to bigger cages with more
perching, as right from the start they are very agile.
As described by Kerry Banks, the Southern Helmeted Curassow Pauxi
unicornis unicornis , has been bred at Birdworld. This is probably the first
successful breeding of this species in Great Britain and Ireland. Anyone
who knows of a previous breeding is asked to inform the Hon. Secretary.

We holidayed on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius in October 1998.
A greatly looked forward to holiday, it was the result of much planning and
the realisation of a long-term ambition inspired by the reintroduction
programmes of three of the world&apos;s rarest birds - the Pink Pigeon Nesoenas
mayeri , Mauritius Kestrel Falco punctatus and Echo Parrakeet Psittacula
echo.
The most advantageous holiday offer was selected and we chose a
Mauritian-run small hotel on the north-west coast. It could not have been
better, it was quiet, well run, the food was good and outside our apartment
was the Indian Ocean, complete with a small coral reef, and we were ideally
situated to view a different glorious sunset each evening.
We arrived at dusk, just as a 1,000 or so Common Mynahs Acridotheres
tristis flew noisily in to roost in the huge tree - by the entrance. It caused me
to wonder if sleep might prove elusive; but after about an hour the birds fell
silent, not slowly but suddenly as if a switch had been turned, off.
In the morning we awoke to find Red-whiskered Bulbuls Pycnonotus
jocusus investigating our balcony and starting to build a nest in an adjoining
shrub. Apparently all these bulbuls, which are very common on the island,
originate from a single pair which escaped from an aviary during the 1892
cyclone. Next we were visited by a brilliant scarlet male Madagascar Fody
Foudia madagascariensis which came and sat In the palm tree outside our
apartment. We had breakfast in the open-sided restaurant overlooking the
bay and fed scraps of food to the mynahs and sparrows waiting on the beach.
Both species cleared the crumbs from the unoccupied tables as soon as the
guests departed.
The first morning we walked along the edge of the ocean, which is
bordered mostly by pine woodland in which Spotted Ground Doves
Streptopelia chinensis and Madagascar Turtle Doves S. picturata were
pottering among the fallen weavers&apos; nests. Others, also made by Village
Weavers Ploceus cucullatus , were strung in great profusion in the trees.
Small flocks of Common Waxbllls Estrilda astrild and, occasionally, Spice
or Nutmeg Finches Lonchura punctulata were seen feeding on the ground
beneath the trees and the bulbuls and fodys provided added interest.
We telephoned Carl Jones' secretary, Chaya, to enquire about the
possibility of visiting the aviaries and were invited there the next day. As it
was the breeding season, we had been warned that this might not be possible,
but fortunately this proved otherwise. We were shown the breeding aviaries
housing Pink Pigeons, Mauritius Kestrels and Echo Parrakeets, as well as

local fruit bats and the rare Rodriguez Fruit Bat, one of which took a piece
of apple when this was offered to it.
We went on to Carl Jones' house and were made most welcome by him,
helped perhaps by us telling him of our sighting of a European Golden Oriole
Oriolus oriolus, a rarely seen species on Mauritius, in the Pamplemousse
Botanical Gardens. It was marvellous to learn first-hand about the work of
the Wildlife Trust. Afterwards a walk in the Black River Gorge as the early
dusk drew in produced the sighting of a Java Deer and huge fruit bats flying
buzzard-like above the canopy. The next day we were invited to visit the
Isle Aux Aigrettes. Nobody had warned us about the rush hour traffic in
Port Louis and the fact that one lane of the motorway is given over to
oncoming traffic, with just a few bollards here and there to separate the
lanes. It was a hair-raising experience and meant that we were a little late
for our appointment. When we eventually arrived the boat took us skimming
over the coral reefs to the island where we were welcomed by Colette, the
student in charge of the reintroduction programmes on the island.
We were shown the work being done to try to stem the spread of non-
endemic plants and encourage the native flora. We also saw Pink Pigeons
on their nests, which are being monitored closely by Colette, who can
recognise each individual bird. Mauritius Kestrels have also been released
there and one seemed to take great pleasure in every now an again zooming
down and scattering the pigeons. A recent addition is a rather good visitor
centre. There was originally a kestrel nest-box near the entrance to show
visitors how this species constructs its nest, etc. However a pair of the kestrels
decided to nest in the box and then began to assault visitors who ventured
too close. Because of this the box was removed.
From the island, we headed north-west to the top end of the Black River
Gorge, where by walking 6.5km (about 4 miles) from the Macchabe Forest
Road along the spectacular gorge and through the forest, we eventually came
to the Field Station. Access to this area is normally restricted due to the
various ongoing research programmes being carried out by the small team
of specialists.
We were met by our guide David Hall, whose work includes monitoring
the Echo Parrakeets and he kindly spared us some time from his busy schedule
to explain about their fight against introduced species of plants and animals.
Especially the war against the rampaging Guava, the main problem plant of
the forest. We were shown fenced areas of woodland where all non-endemic
plants have been removed and native trees including Black Ebony and huge
tree ferns are now nourishing. Pink Pigeons were calling all around us and
in one clearing there were several Echo Parrakeets. David said that one of
these responded to being called down to his whistle. He did this for us, and
the parrakeet came on to my arm and tried to demolish my watch. By now

I (J.M.) was speechless with excitement, but that was not all, for a second
parrakeet landed on my outstretched arm and joined the first bird. Although
we then had a long walk back through the gorge, it had really been worth it.
I still marvel that I had two of the world's rarest birds perched on my arm!
Our picnic back in the car park was shared with 12 bulbuls, two fodys and a
friendly dog.
We managed to see eight of the nine endemic birds species of Mauritius,
missing only the Mascarene Paradise Flycatcher Terpsiphone bourbonnensis.
White-tailed Tropic Birds Phaethon lepturus were quite common and
swooped down along the steep sides of many of the gorges. At the mouth of
one of the rivers we succeeded in adding half-a-dozen (6) waders to our list
of birds. We had heard that the Moorhen Gall inula chloropus has been
recorded on Mauritius and, as hard as it may be to believe, we tried to find
one to add to our list and finally succeeded in doing so on the edge of a
volcanic crater lake in the heart of the mountains.
We enjoyed a wonderful holiday on this fascinating island. The
birdwatching was superb, even though we did not, for instance, see anything
like the number of species we saw when we visited Gambia.

Despite long periods of unfavourable weather durinq 1998, a number of
interesting bird species were reared successfully at Vogelpark Walsrode and
its breeding centre on Mallorca, where the weather effects the birds far less.
This article reports the highlights of the past breeding season as well as
notable acquisitions and departures.
Blue-crowned Lorikeets Vini australis are inhabitants of small islands
in the tropical South Pacific, namely the southern Lau group of Fiji, Samoa
and Tonga, as well as some remote islands between these archipelagoes.
Although this species has disappeared from all islands which have been
invaded by Black Rats Rattus rattus, it is still numerous on a few small
remote islands (Rinke 1992). In 1998, we reared four chicks, the first ever
of this species at Walsrode and two pairs are incubating eggs at the time of
writing (17.11.98), while another two chicks are half-way towards fledging.
Blue-crowned Lorikeets at flowers of Parrot Heliconia
A few other delicate, small parrots, which are not often bred successfully
had an exceptionally good year, in particular the tiny Whiskered Lorikeets
Oreopsittacus arfakianus, four young of which fledged after these lorikeets
had not reared any chicks since 1994. Again, at the time of writing, three

pairs are sitting on eggs. Philippine Loriculusphilippensis and Blue-crowned
Hanging Parrots L. galgulus produced six and eight young respectively.
Timor Red-winged Parrots Aprosmictus jonquillaceus are another rarely
kept species of which we succeeded in establishing a pair in 1997. In 1998,
this pair reared, at its first attempt, four chicks. The outstanding parrot
event at Ornis Mallorca was our first captive breeding of a Pesquet's Parrot
Psitttichcis fulgiclus. The parents looked after the chick well for about four
weeks, but then it had to be removed from the nest log. It grew up perfectly
under artificial conditions, while the parents produced another clutch, and
one more chick hatched, which has yet to fledge.

Although the number of cranes reared in 1998 was average for Walsrode,
a few of our new and promising pairs produced eggs for the first time which,
however, proved to be infertile or died during incubation. Two pairs of
Black-necked Cranes Grus nigricollis , one pair of Siberian Cranes G.
leucogeranus, a young Brolga G. rubicunda and a pair of Red-crowned
Cranes G.japonensis laid eggs for the first time. Three of the Black-necked
Cranes were hatched at Vogelpark Walsrode in 1990, 1991 and 1994, while

one female came from the International Crane Foundation (ICF), where it
was hatched in 1993. Hatched in 1991, both Siberian Cranes are the first
offspring of this species bred at Walsrode. We replaced their eggs with a
Demoiselle Crane egg and the two inexperienced Siberians proved to be
good parents, until the chick died after consuming indigestible materials.
The young female Brolga hatched at the ICF in 1993, after its arrival was
housed in an enclosure next to an old male. The birds seemed to be well-
paired but when their enclosures were joined, they did not get on very well.
After the female had laid her first egg, we tried to obtain semen from the
male, but the bird was very uncooperative, and we were unable to use artificial
insemination. Despite these apparent failures, which actually provide
excellent prospects for the forthcoming seasons, we reared among others,
three Black-necks, one of these reared by its parents for the first time, four
Wattled Cranes Bugeranus carunculatus and two young Hooded G. monacha,
perhaps the most delicate crane species.
At the end of August, our Bateleur Eagles Terathopius ecaudatus laid an
egg, which was transferred to an incubator. In the previous two years, we
had one chick which died during hatching in an incubator, and an egg which
died during incubation by the parents. For the first time, the parents produced
another egg, approximately 40 days after their first egg. The chick hatched
after 48 to 53 days incubation - the exact laying date could not be determined,
because we checked the nest at intervals of five days only in order not to
disturb the pair too much. This is the first hatching of a Bateleur Eagle at
Vogelpark Walsrode. The Secretary Birds Sagittarius serpentarius had an
exceptionally good year in 1998. Earlier problems with leg growth and
deformities were overcome by using different food and additives, and three
juveniles were reared successfully. Apparently, there are only a few
institutions worldwide, which have bred this unusual bird of prey during the
1990s.
Our breeding group of Red-crested Touracos Tauraco erythrolophus had
another successful year, with five chicks reared by two pairs, one of which
was established in spring 1998. Another first for Walsrode was the successful
hatching and fledging of two Fischer's Touracos Tauraco fischeri, after we
had exchanged mates several times. Our second pair is still not very
compatible, and it will certainly take some more time and patience before
we will have a really successful breeding group. Nevertheless, a start has
been made with this species, which is threatened by habitat destruction in
its tiny East African range. As a consequence, Fischer's Touraco was selected
as a European studbook species during the last EAZA/EEP meeting in Berlin.
The Horned Guans Oreophasis derbianus laid a few eggs again, but
never in anything close to a nest, and those eggs which were not broken,
proved to be infertile. Artificial insemination may be an option as the pair is

not as compatible as it should be, but the large cracids' susceptibility to
stress has kept us from using this technique.
A pair of Coral-billed Ground Cuckoos Carpococcyx renauldi produced
five clutches within only six months, of which three were removed for
artificial incubation. We hand-reared a total of five birds, and the pair itself
reared one chick which, however, was lost shortly after hatching. This very
attractive and increasingly threatened species is present in only a few
collections.
Approximately ten day old Bateleur Eagle
After many attempts over previous years, a pair of Spotted Imperial
Pigeons Ducula carola reared a squab. Our birds may be the only
representatives of this species (the numbers of which are decreasing in its
Philippine Islands home) being kept in Europe. A very unusual fruit pigeon
is the Papuan Mountain Pigeon Gymnophaps albertisii , which has been
observed crossing glaciers in the high mountains of New Guinea. In 1998,
a second pair of the species bred and reared two squabs. Our population has
increased to 12 birds, originating from three founders only.

young, left the nest-box.
Most important acquisition during 1998 was a pair of Steller's Sea
Eagles Haliaaetus pelagicus the female of which came from Moscow Zoo,
and the male from Almaty. Both birds are very young having been hatched
in 1996 and 1998 respectively, so it will be a long time until they come into
breeding condition.

After having received two male Kagu Rhynochetos jubatus in 1997, a
female arrived at the end of 1998 from the Parc Zoologique et Forestier
(PZF) in Noumea, New Caledonia. The transfer is a result of a cooperation
agreement between the PZF, VPW and the Brehm Fund for International
Bird Conservation, with the aim of preserving the threatened wildlife of this
island, which has been severely depleted of its native animal and plant species
since the arrival of humans approximately 3,500 years ago.
In November three Brolga Cranes arrived from the ICF, where the male
was hatched in 1996 and the two females in 1997. This species has apparently
never been bred in Europe.

Two pairs of the gaudily feathered Harlequin Duck Histrionicus
histrionicus joined our flock of northern sea ducks in spring. At that time,
the drakes had attained their first breeding plumage, which is still rather
dull at about nine months of age. Now they have moulted again, and their
brightly patterned plumage stands out among all the eiders and oldsquaws,
which share the enclosure with the Harlequins.
We exchanged Asian Openbill Storks Anastomus oscitans with San Diego
Zoo, so that the sex ratios in both institutions are almost equal now. This
species is kept nowhere else outside its natural range in south-east Asia, and
it has never reproduced in captivity. With San Diego's and our experience
of breeding the African Openbill A. lamelligerus the reproduction of its Asian
cousin should be achieved within the next few years.
The most notable arrival on the parrot section was a group of the colourful
Orange-breasted Fig Parrot Cyclopsitta gulielmitertii. The other four species
of the fig parrot group breed regularly at Walsrode(Miiller &amp; Neumann 1998),
and are now established in captivity, a goal which we also hope to achieve
with the Orange-breasted species.
The notoriously difficult genera of Geoffroyus and Prioniturus are
represented at Walsrode by two male Red-cheeked Parrots (7 geoffroyi and
a pair of Bum Racquet-tailed R mada . Three of these birds have been held
at Walsrode's Lori Atrium since October 1995, longevity records perhaps
for captive birds of both genera.

Regional collection planning by European zoos places the emphasis on
collections planning for the long-term future of the species they keep by
ensuring that the captive populations have the potential to be self-sustaining
over several generations. Any species which is considered to be of particular
importance, becomes the subject of a management plan which begins with
the preparation of a regional studbook to plot the demographic and genetic
status of the captive population. Should this be in need of additional stock,
zoological collections are encouraged to obtain fresh stock from the wild,
rather than from dealers or collections outside the region, that have stock
whose history may be unknown.

and Douglas Kempler, Director of the new aquarium being built there. The
expedition was organised by the North American consultant group, WCI.
The team consisted of Scott Drieschmann, Mrs Corey Drieschmann, Frank
Todd, Frank Towhey, Ricardo Matus and Mrs Betsey Pincheira Lazo. It
met in Ushuaia, the most southerly town in Argentina, from where the team
sailed to South Georgia to collect the eggs from two locations. The permit
allowing the eggs to be collected was granted on the strict condition that the
eggs were to be collected only during the last two weeks of March. The
reason being that these eggs would not hatch before the beginning of the
winter and the offspring would certainly die, for they would be too young to
survive the Antarctic winter. It also clearly states on the permit that the
offspring reared from the eggs cannot be sold commercially or transferred
South Georgia Teal or Pintail, Prion Island
to other collections without the prior agreement of the Falkland Islands
Government. We have also undertaken to provide the authorities there with
details of our methods, results, and all scientific data resulting from the
rearing of the birds and their keeping and breeding thereafter.
Early on the afternoon of March 16th, I boarded an internal flight from
Buenos Aires to Ushuaia, not only the most southerly town in Argentina,
but also the most southerly town in the world. As we descended there were
breathtaking views of the Patagonian landscape, with a rolling series of
mountain peaks topped with snow and beech forest on the sides of the lower

slopes, scenery unlike any I had seen previously. Upon landing the team
met up and we took a bus transfer to the hotel where we spent the night
before sailing the next day. Ushuaia is a small town (population 40,000)
situated on the edge of the Beagle Channel. The short drive from the airport
to the hotel passes along the coast and there we saw Magellanic Flightless
Steamer Ducks Tachyeres pteneres and Kelp Geese Chloephaga hybrida.
On the morning of March 17th, we had some spare time before we sailed,
and used it to do some last minute shopping and see some of the local scenery.
The highlight for me was a trip inlapd to the foot of the nearest mountains to
see where the glaciers reach down to the beech forest. When we were half-
way up the mountainside in a cable car, we were surprised and delighted by
the sight of an Andean Condor Vultur gryphus soaring high above us, which
was almost certainly the most unexpected bird sighted on the trip. Later we
gathered on board our ship, a former Russian research vessel used nowadays
for ecotourism trips to the Antarctic region. The ship; the Professor
Multcinovskiy , had finished its tour commitments for the season and we were
able to negotiate the extra journey before it returned to its home port of St
Petersburg for the duration of the Antarctic winter. The late afternoon journey
through the Beagle Channel out onto the open sea provided some interesting

Southern Sea Lion Otariaflavescens.
The next morning we were out on the open sea. Black-browed Albatross,
Giant Petrel, Sooty Shearwater and King Cormorant, species we had seen
the day before, were still visible. New species were Wandering Albatross
D. exulans, White-chinned Petrel Procellaria aequinoctialis , Wilson's Storm
Petrel Oceanites oceanics. Common Diving Petrel Pelcanoides urinatrix
berard and Antarctic Skua Catharacta antarctica. The most surprising sight
was that of a Dark-faced Ground Tyrant Muscisaxicola frontalis, which had
obviously joined us on the ship before we sailed and had remained hidden
until it was seen on deck the following morning. The next day, March 19th,

of birds. We were pleased to see four species of albatross. In addition to the

were also followed for sometime by Royal D. epomophora and Light-mantled
Sooty Albatross Phoebetria palpebrata , which circled the ship as we
progressed through the fairly calm sea. Other birds seen during the day
included Giant Petrel, White-chinned Petrel, Sooty Shearwater and Wilson's
Storm Petrel, all of which we had seen previously, plus three new species
White-headed Petrel Pterodromci lessonii , Soft-plumaged Petrel P. mollis
and Greater Shearwater P gravis.
On March 20th we crossed the Antarctic seas convergence zone and
there followed a rapid 5* drop in the sea temperature in less than an hour, on
which was our third complete day at sea. With one further day ahead, the
passage into cooler water seemed to be marked by an increase in sightings
of both marine mammals and birds. Mammals seen during March 20th
included Fin Whale Balaenoptera physalus , Hour-glass Dolphin
Lagenorhynchus cruciger, Antarctic Fur Seal Arctocephalus gazella and
Southern Elephant Seal Mirounga leonina. Birds seen included the same
four species of albatross seen the day before, as well as Giant Petrel, White-
chinned Petrel, Soft-plumaged Petrel, White-headed Petrel, Sooty
Shearwater, Greater Shearwater, Wilson's Storm Petrel, King Shag and
Common Diving Petrel. Two new species recorded on this day were Black-
bellied Storm Petrel Fregetta tropica and White-crested Elaenia Elaenia
albiceps.
We reached the coast of South Georgia just after midday on March 21st,
and followed the coast around to the town of Grytviken. It was there we
were to meet the marine officer who would approve our documentation for
the collecting expedition and accompany us to ensure good practise was
followed throughout. The most exciting feature of the day's birdwatching
was the presence of large numbers of penguins, with flocks heading out to
sea in search of food, or returning to the shore after having fed. Three
species were repeatedly seen in the sea throughout the day, the King Penguin,
Gentoo Penguin Pygoscelis papua and Macaroni Penguin Eudyptes
chrysolophus. Our first sight of King Penguins in the wild was most
welcoming, as they were the main reason for us being there. We reached
Grytviken in the early evening and were joined there by Pat Lurcock, the
marine officer for South Georgia. As well as the birds we had seen during
the previous few days, now we had reached the coast we also saw several
new species, including Blue Petrel Halobaena taerulea , Blue-eyed Shag P.
atriceps, Georgian Diving Petrel P georgicus and Snowy Sheathbill Chionis
alba. A number of prions Pachyptila spp. were also seen but species
identification could not be confirmed. In the morning a pod of Hour-glass
Dolphins had again joined us and we had a brief sighting of a Minke Whale
B. acutorostrata about 600m (approx. 650yd) off the starboard side of the
ship.

We sailed from Grytviken in the early hours of March 22nd and by 9.00am
had reached our first destination, St Andrew's Bay, where we planned to
begin egg collecting. From the ship we could see the coastline covered by
thousands of white spots, each one a King Penguin. Even from out in the
bay the smell of their excrement with its very high uric acid content was
highly distinctive. Colonies of King Penguins can number up to 35,000
birds and can be smelt from a considerable distance away. We transferred
from the ship to the beach using Zodiac inflatable boats, taking with us two
portable incubators, each with the capacity to hold just over 100 eggs. As
we neared the shore the sound of the surf began to be drowned out by the
noise made by the mass of wildlife on the beach. The King Penguins were
by far the most numerous species, with thousands of birds making up the
colony. The unique breeding cycle of the King Penguin, the slowest of any
bird, taking as it does up to 16 months to complete, meant that within the
one colony were birds at all stages of development.
There were adults in the process of breeding, including birds still
incubating eggs or brooding newly hatched chicks; other chicks at various
stages of development; fully developed juveniles still in thick natal down;
sub-adults; and adults that had already bred and were moulting now. In
among the thousands of King Penguins were a small number of Gentoo
Penguins and our first sight of the Chinstrap Penguin P. antarctica came
when we saw five on the rocks close to the shore. Two other bird species
were prominent on the beach, the Snowy Sheathbills which ran between the
King Penguins always on the look-out for an opportunist meal and the skuas
which flew low over the colony also looking for an opportunist meal in the
form of an unattended egg or chick they could seize.
Of the three species of mammals by the beach, the most numerous by far
were the Fur Seals which occupied most of the moss grassland which ran
inland from the gravel beach. As it was late autumn most of the adult males
had left the breeding grounds leaving behind mainly adult females and the
year's young, which were nearly independent. Small groups of female
Elephant Seals were present on the beach. The most unexpected mammals
we saw on South Georgia were the herds of Reindeer Rangifer tarandus
introduced as a source of food when the whaling and Fur Seal industries
were at their height.
Working in small teams around the edge of the colony, we slowly begun
collecting the eggs. The incubating bird was seized gently from behind and
the egg was removed from beneath the fold of skin which helps keep the
egg balanced on top of the bird's feet. The eggs were then taken to portable
incubators. This was a slow and careful process. Each time a member of
the team entered or left the colony to take an egg to the incubator, as they
walked past the incubating and brooding penguins, great care was taken not

to disturb them any more than was absolutely necessary. We wanted to
ensure that they did not leave their eggs or young at the mercy of the skuas
which sailed low over the colony. Although we knew that very few if any of
these late eggs and chicks would survive the Antarctic winter, we nevertheless
wanted to minimise our interference with the natural process. After collecting
eggs for almost three hours we had reached our initial target and returned to
the ship to begin assessing the eggs we had collected. King Penguin eggs
are large and heavy, they measure up to 117mm x 82mm and weigh up to
350g. Although I have for many years worked on procedures for artificially
incubating the eggs of many species of captive birds, the King Penguin eggs
were particularly difficult to assess due to their thick shells. This was made
even more difficult by the fact that they had to be transferred immediately
to the incubator to prevent them becoming chilled in the harsh climatic
conditions under which they were being collected. Once back on board the
ship where we were able to maintain a warmer air temperature, we began
examining the eggs using a light. This gave us a good idea as to what stage
of development the embryos had reached. We wanted to collect eggs which
were at least 28 days old, so that they would have the best chance of surviving
the journey back to Moody Gardens or Loro Parque. At the end of our first
day at St Andrew's Bay only 49 eggs were considered to have sufficiently
well developed embryos to fulfil the above criteria. The marine officer told
us that the local weather conditions had been severe up until three weeks
before, which was probably why so many eggs had been laid during the past
three weeks, when the weather had become more favourable. The climatic
conditions on South Georgia can vary greatly from one part of the island to
another and so we decided that the best course of action was to move to a
different location for the second day. The eggs which when we assessed
them we found were under 28 days old and did not have sufficiently well
developed embryos would be taken ashore there and, hopefully, exchanged
for eggs which were at least 28 days old and had more advanced embryos.
During the night we sailed to our new location.
On the morning of March 23rd we were anchored off Royal Bay, which
was to be our second collecting point. Here we hoped to find many more
birds which had begun laying a few weeks earlier than most of those at St
Andrew's Bay. Once again we took with us two incubators, these contained
the under 28 day old eggs collected earlier which we hoped to replace with
eggs at least 28 days old. Once again the shoreline was dominated by King
Penguins, with an estimated 30,000 birds on the beach. Also present were a
few Gentoo Penguins and Chin-strap Penguins, as well as, skuas and Snowy
Sheathbills, which always seem to be found where there are large colonies
of King Penguins. Also on the beach there were a few juvenile Fur Seals
and just a single large female Elephant Seal. By now it had become apparent

that in order to collect eggs that had been incubated for at least 28 days, we
had to collect them from close to the centre of the colony. The first birds to
arrive and therefore the first to lay, are found in the centre of the colony,
while later arrivals are found around the edge of the colony. Then as the
eggs of the earlier birds hatch and the chicks grow bigger and require more
food, these birds and their chicks move out towards the edge of the colony
which allows later arrivals to move towards the centre during the later stages
of incubation, where their chicks when they hatch will be safest.
The second day of egg collecting went well. Each time a new egg was
collected, we took the opportunity to place beneath the bird one of the eggs
from St Andrew's Bay which were considered not sufficiently advanced to
withstand the long journey back. In nearly all cases this seemed to work
well. By the end of the second day we had 217 eggs which we considered
suitable for our purposes (100 for Moody Gardens and 117 for Loro Barque).
The eggs were contained in two incubators over which we maintained a
twenty-four hour watch. Having achieved the primary objective of the
expedition we set sail for Grytviken to return the marine officer, Pat Lurcock,
to his post.
On the morning of March 24th we were ahead of schedule and had time
to make two stops as we sailed up the coast. The first was at an old whaling
station at Stromness, which proved an interesting experience. The buildings
now in a state of disrepair, with some of them falling down, have in many
cases been taken over as shelters by Elephant Seals and Fur Seals. Much of
the equipment used by the whalers is still there, although now old and rusting,
and the beach area is littered with old bones and rusting pieces of boats,
which form a silent monument to the events which took place there decades
ago. The stony beach which extends back into grassland was occupied by
several small groups of Gentoo Penguins many of them making their way
along pathways from their Inland colony to the sea.
In the afternoon we stopped at Prion Island, and after landing and climbing
up through tussock grass, had some of the most memorable sights on the
trip. On top of the island we were treated to the sight of a number of nesting
pairs of Wandering Albatross, two of which had chicks in the nest. A number
of newly fledged Wandering Albatross were also wandering about on the
island, and we saw several Giant Petrel chicks. From a cliff ledge I was
able to watch and photograph a pair of nesting Light-mantled Albatross. I
was also able to watch and photograph perhaps the rarest species was saw
on the trip, a small flock of 11 South Georgia Teal or Pintail Anas georgica
georgica on a pool hidden in tussock grass. The species with which I spent
most time on the island was a colony of Gentoo Penguins. I had previously
seen small groups in other locations, but this was the first opportunity to
watch them from within the colony. The first thing that surprised me was

how far up the island they had established their colony, several hundred
metres (yards) away and steeply uphill of the beach area. I spent almost an
hour in the middle of the colony, which even though it had clearly completed
its breeding cycle, remained energetically engaged in nest building activity.
As is typical in such densely populated colonies, most of the nesting material
was stolen from adjacent nests. As a result of this there was a lot of activity
in the colony as the birds continually squabbled over the ownership of the
nesting material and searched for new material, while trying not to venture
too far from their own unprotected nests.
On the morning of March 24th we were back on the open sea. The
return journey was slightly shorter, as we were heading for Port Stanley, the
principle port and capital of the Falkland Islands. Perhaps the most
impressive sights during the voyage were the pods of up to 40 Hour-glass
Dolphins which swum off the bow of the ship on two occasions during the
mornings of March 25th and 26th. No further new species were recorded
until we reached the Falkland Islands late on the afternoon of March 27th.
The approach into Port Stanley brought with it sightings of Fin Whales and
Minke Whales, species we had previously seen close to South Georgia. We
also had our first sighting of Peele's Dolphins Lagenorhynchus australis
which accompanied the ship for just under an hour. New bird species seen
were Falkland Island Flightless Steamer Duck T. brachypterus, Falkland
Island Kelp Goose C. h. malvinarum and Greater Magellan Goose C. picta
leucoptera. We also saw Magellanic Penguin, which breed on the Falkland
Islands, our first sighting of this species since the day we sailed from Ushuaia.
We slept overnight on board the ship and then went ashore and travelled by
road to Mount Pleasant Airport. From there we flew to Punta Arenas in
southern Chile, then took an internal flight to Santiago de Chile. The team
from Moody Gardens, together with Frank Towhey, flew to Florida and
then on to Texas and I travelled with Scott Drieschman and Frank Todd to
Madrid, then on to Tenerife. The flight from Santiago de Chile to Madrid
was the longest leg of the journey. The incubator was powered by battery,
but with 117 large, well developed eggs in the insulated container, the heater
was barely necessary, as for long periods of time, the eggs themselves
generated sufficient heat.
Throughout the flight the temperature in the incubator was monitored
continually by Scott Drieshman and myself. Of particular concern were the
take-offs and landings, when changes in the air pressure in the cabin had a
direct effect on the air temperature in the incubator. On our eventual arrival
at Tenerife's north airport, we were driven quickly to Loro Parque where
the quarantine nursery was prepared and waiting. Loro Parque's Assistant
Curator, Mike Downman, was waiting and the eggs were transferred to two
specially built incubators. As we landed, the first egg was already in the

process of hatching and the chick emerged shortly after we reached the

THE ROAD TO RODE

<bodyText confidence="0.991333472222222" page_id="56285979"  page_num="181" year="" vol="">
In The Road to Rode , Avicultural Society Vice President, Betty Risdon,
describes how she first met the late Donald Risdon, then General Manager of
Dudley Zoo, at a celebratory birthday drink in a pub in Birmingham. He had
previously been the Manager of Keston Foreign Bird Farm, where they were
first in the UK to breed the Blue-fronted Amazon in 1939. After serving in
the RAF during World War Two, he returned to Keston as a director and in
1949 became General Manager of Dudley Zoo. Betty has lots of amusing
stories about their time together at the zoo, where they spent the early years of
their married life and where they remained until they left to found Rode Tropical
Bird Gardens, which they opened to the public in 1962.
Betty describes the search for a suitable site for Don's dream of a zoo
specialising in exotic birds and how they finally found Rode. Initially, he had
grave doubts about the 17 acre (approx.7 hectare) site, feeling it would be too
big, but as they drove up to the car park, a Cuckoo called and that clinched it
for him. The owners at that time, an elderly couple, were running a market
garden in one of the walled gardens near the lake. Rode Manor itself had
fallen down or been pulled down and most of the grounds were badly
overgrown and resembled a jungle. After some 4,000 tons of accumulated
mud was scooped out of the lake, the first birds to be introduced on to it were
a pair of Black-necked Swans followed by Shelducks and Don's favourite
Mandarins and Carolina&apos;;. The first aviaries and enclosures built housed
pheasants and parrots, including a three or four year old Blue and Yellow
Macaw which still resides there to this day. Cranes and penguins were added
to the collection also hombills, toucans and touracos, and another of Don's
special favourites, the Royal or Golden-breasted Starling, a species Don was
one of the first to breed.
In 1988 Don began to have trouble with his eyes and the following year
Macular Degeneration was diagnosed. He also developed deafness. Donald
Risdon died April 24th 1994.
He had been a Vice President of the Avicultural Society since 1973, had
served on the Council and had long been an active supporter of the Society.
... AND THE ROADS FROM RODE
Don did not share Betty's love of travelling. Tm glad it's you going with

great pleasure from seeing the wonderful birds. In Australia he struck up a
rapport with Sir Edward Hallstrom, when the latter found that Don shared his
view that the Paradise Parrakeet was not a distinct species but a hybrid!
The Roads from Rode is Betty Risdon's account of her travels, firstly with
her husband Don (which she also wrote about in The Road to Rode) but mainly
since his death. Tahiti, the Marquesa and Pitcairn Islands, Easter Island, the
Seychelles, Aldabra, Madagascar and Zanzibar are just some of the far away
places she has visited and writes about. Of particular interest to me were the
chapters on East Africa and Antarctica. The first because it brought back so
many memories of Kenya and people I knew there, such as the late Gerry
Kirkham, John Pearson, a pilot with East African Airways, who later made
wildlife films for TV, also sadly no longer with us, Jenny Pearson, Lucy and
Ivan Bampton. The Antarctica chapter I enjoyed because of just having edited
Roger Sweeney's account of collecting King Penguin eggs on South Georgia
(pp 169-179). Betty also writes about the penguins and other birds, the dolphins
and whales, and of visiting Ushuaia, Grytviken, Stromness and Prion Island.
Betty's book includes a photo of Grytviken and of the marine artist, Keith
Shackleton (who wrote the Preface to this book), standing beside the grave of
his relative the great Antarctic explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton, who died at
Grytviken and was buried there in 1922.
The Road to Rode and The Roads from Rode are published by Rode

are available from there by post price #6.75 each or #13.50 for the two,
including p &amp;p in the UK (overseas postage is extra). Or they can be bought

WILDLIFE GUIDE TO COSTA RICA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998634692307692" page_id="56285980"  page_num="182" year="" vol="">
Without doubt those travelling to Costa Rica who are interested in wildlife,
other than just that which flies, will find The Ecotraveller s Wildlife Guide to
Costa Rica by Les Beletsky is a must. This guide, for the first time, includes
colour plates covering not just birds but the identification of many of the
common salamanders, frogs, toads, lizards, snakes, turtles and about 50 species
of mammals. Those interested in twitching every bird in sight though will still
need the Field Guide to Costa Rican Birds, as only 200 species, about a quarter
of the resident species are covered.
I have reservations about parts of the text - not the quality of it which is
very good but the necessity of some passages which I feel are irrelevant and
could have been omitted. Does the visitor really need a brief chapter on each
family? That on birds starts: 'Birds are vertebrates that can fly' and then goes
on to explain how birds evolved. However, having said this, it does contain

much useful information and will provide good reading on those occasions
when it pours of rain all day.
As an introduction to the wildlife of Costa Rica it is an excellent guide for
those on package holidays with set destinations and is likely to be the only
guide that is needed. However, those travelling independently are also likely
to need one of the backpackers' guides to help them find their way around.
Chapters cover Ecotourism, Geography, Habitats and Conservation. All
illustrations are accompanied by a brief paragraph on identification and habitat
preferences, plus a key to the latter and a useful list of parks in which they can
be found. I have no grumbles with the actual plates which are good but I do
hate the wasted space, as with a little more thought at least one extra species
could have been included on each plate. Without doubt it is the best wildlife
guide covering this Central American country. I do feel though that there is a
market for a series of more in depth guides to the world's wildlife areas -
perhaps this will be the next step once this present format has been exhausted.
The Ecoircu/eiler &apos;s Wildlife Guide to Costa Rica by Les Beletsky (ISBN
\0x25A0OH 2-084810-4) is published by Academic Press. It is priced #19.95 in the UK

I fear that Population Limitation in Birds by Ian Newton, a weighty
academic volume of nearly 600 pages will interest only a few aviculturists.
Even those who have an interest in the life histories of their subjects might
well be disappointed because it is in the nature of such tomes to be reviews of
the literature, in which examples to support themes are culled from the complete
range of ornithological literature. This means that it is the theme which is
important and not the examples. Recourse to the Index may or may not lead
to a reference to a particular species. If it does it will be of limited value, but
if it does not, it does not mean that the information does not apply! However,
these books always have meticulous bibliographies and as a pointer towards
more detailed information are invaluable.
There are three parts (BEHAVIOUR AND DENSITY REGULATION,

altogether. Part 1 deals with the role of behaviour in density regulation, for
example, Social Systems and Status, Habitat and Density Regulation, Territorial
Behaviour and Density Limitation. Part 2, with such heads as Food-supply,
Nest-sites, Predation, Parasites and Pathogens, might be of more interest. Part
3 comprises three chapters: Hunting and PestControl, Pesticides and Pollution,
and Extinction.

as one would expect from this author. Ian Newton is well-known for his work
on the Sparrowhawk, and before that on finches, especially the Bullfinch. He
is aiming at wildlife biologists such as the research worker, student and those
involved in the practical management of bird populations. Within the
avicultural world I can see it occupying an occasionally useful place on the
shelves of bird curators and zoological directors, and being borrowed by
students and trainee keepers who are working on projects or towards
examinations.

POPULAR BRITISH BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9973947" page_id="56285982"  page_num="184" year="" vol="">
With the number of books published on aviculture and articles appearing
in publications such as Cage &amp; Aviary Birds on a wide variety of species, the
quantity has increased to such a degree, covering many sections of this most
fascinating and rewarding of hobbies, beginners have a bewildering array
from which to make a choice. In Bullfinches, Chaffinches and Bramblings,
Popular British Birds in Aviculture, Vol.4, by Peter Lander and Bob Partridge,
the birds covered are clearly defined and any beginner will find this book
most helpful. It covers each finch's description, colour variants, suggestions
as to the most suitable aviary, feeding, in fact the general husbandry involved,
breeding and even guidance to exhibiting.
Peter Lander (sadly now deceased) spent a lifetime studying birds and
keeping and breeding them and was exceedingly knowledgeable; whilst his
co-author, Bob Partridge, needs little introduction to British bird keepers
familiar with his fascination for colour variants and genetics. Although there
is no substitute for practical experience and knowing your birds, advice such
as that given in this book by two such experienced keepers can prove invaluable
and make this publication a work I can recommend for any beginner. In
addition the photography is of the usual high standard one has come to expect
of Dennis Avon. In short it is a book well worth acquiring.

Josephine Pithon at the University of York, who has been undertaking a
three- year study of feral Ring-necked Parrakeets Psittacula krameri in the
UK, has estimated that there are now 2,000 or more of them living wild,
mainly in south-east England. The largest single population is in west
London, where they range from Windsor in the west to Richmond in the
east and to Reigate in the south. There are smaller populations between
Hither Green and Footscray in south-east London and around Margate and
Ramsgate, Kent. They also occur as far afield as East Anglia and South
Wales. The study was sponsored by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food, which wants to assess whether the parrakeets pose a threat to
farm -crops, especially in fruit-growing areas such as Kent.

The aim of the two-day workshop is to bring together as many as possible
breeders and others with an interest in these fascinating birds. It is envisaged
that there will be a number of working groups which will compile a
comprehensive Husbandry Manual covering such aspects as housing,
feeding, health and breeding. Those unable to attend but who may possess

Currumbin Sanctuary is one hour's drive south of Brisbane, on
Queensland's Gold Coast. The cost of the two-day workshop is A$50.00 per
person, which includes morning tea, lunch and afternoon tea on both days,
and a copy of the Husbandry Manual. Accommodation is readily available
in the area and Coolangatta Airport is only five minutes away.
Following the workshop there will be a field trip to Northern Queensland
with world renown parrot expert Joe Forshaw. It will include two days in
Cairns/Kuranda, followed by five days in the Iron Range on Cape York.
Participants are promised a wonderful time looking at wild fig parrots
(Macleay's and Marshall's), Palm Cockatoos, Red-cheeked Parrots and
Eclectus, plus many other species, including cassowaries. The party will be
limited to 15 participants and is likely to cost about A$2,900 per person.
