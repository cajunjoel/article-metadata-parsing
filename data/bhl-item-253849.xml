JAVAN BLACK-THROATED FRUITSUCKER
(Chloropsis cochinchinensis nigricollis)
By Mrs. Wharton-Tigar
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.986907705882353" page_id="56321761"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
" This bird is found in the heavy forests of Java, in pairs or small
parties. It is a restless bird, incessantly in motion, feeding upon insects,
soft fruits, and berries." I can find no further reference to this species
in the textbooks.
In captivity they are delightful birds, very tame and confiding ;
the cock of my pair when at liberty would alight on my hand, head, or
shoulder out of sheer affection. Their song is not outstanding ; they
require plenty of exercise, so are not suitable birds to keep in an
ordinary sized cage. Nor are they when in really high condition safe
with smaller birds, as I know to my cost. How few softbills are !
My pair are most devoted, and have played with the idea of nesting
almost since I first had them, some eighteen months ago. The cock
is a most unselfish mate, always willing to give up a titbit to his wife,
which she greedily demands as a right. Whether they will ever seriously
proceed to rear a family is a chance that I would not dare to hope for
because I fear it is very unlikely.
In case it may be helpful I will now give details of feeding. Although

C. S. Webb--A Collector in French Cameroon
I do not know if it is the best way, I keep several species of Fruit-
suckers very fit on it. A little insectivorous food, cut-up grapes, soaked
currants, a very little grated egg, a piece of sweet orange, pear, or apple
hung up, a dessertspoonful of nectar daily made from condensed
milk, Mellin's food, and honey, and two mealworms per day each.
A COLLECTOR IN FRENCH CAMEROON
By C. S. Webb
In 1935 I visited French Cameroon in West Africa, with the idea
of collecting some of the many varieties of beautiful birds which had
never or rarely been seen by aviculturists in England. It was formerly
a German possession, but is now a French Mandate, and is bordered by
Gaboon in the south, Belgian Congo in the east, and British Cameroon
in the north.
This is one of the most interesting parts of Africa to the ornithologist,
especially to one unable to undertake a long expedition into the interior,
for many varieties of Central African birds are here found comparatively
near the coast, but do not occur further west in Nigeria or the Gold
Coast.
Cameroon is divided into three natural zones. From south to north
they are (1) forest region, (2) savannah or park-like country, (3)
semi-arid region. North of this is the Great Sahara Desert.
On my way to Cameroon I w^as greatly interested in the native
medicine market in Lagos, Nigeria. Here was to be seen an amazing
assortment of dried birds and reptiles, being sold as " cures " or charms
for various complaints. There were large numbers of dried heads of
monkeys, Hawks, and a Red-billed Hornbill (probably Lophopheros
camerus). Apart from these there were also live giant land snails,
tortoises, and chameleons, the latter being sold apparently to anyone
bothered by the attentions of evil spirits. The most amusing exhibit
was a large tin containing live electric cat-fish, the shock from which
was supposed to cure rheumatism. Judging by the screams of some
lady passengers who were brave enough to put their hands in the tin.

I imagine the shock was considerable. Duala, the principal port of
French Cameroon, is hot and humid, but it is quite a busy and
prosperous place, being the exporting centre of the palm-nut and palm-
oil industry. It was rather surprising to find an hotel with a
swimming-bath attached--an unexpected luxury in West Africa.
From Duala I proceeded by rail to Eseka, a small town about
100 miles inland, where there is a large trade in palm-oil and cocoa.
The whole journey was through dense forest and not particularly
enjoyable on account of the heat. Through the kindness of the United
Africa Co. I was able to occupy a house on the edge of the forest, and
this proved to be an excellent centre for collecting. I was especially
keen to get a number of the two varieties of Black-capped Waxbills,
Estrilda nonnula and E. atricapilla, neither of which had been imported
before, except a pair of the East African form of E. atricapilla, which
I brought from Kenya in 1933. Fortunately I found both species quite
common at Eseka in fairly equal proportions, and as often as not they
were seen in small mixed flocks. There is a marked resemblance in the
upper parts of the two species, and the natives do not recognize any
difference in them. Although their feeding habits appear to be identical
they require different treatment when first captured. The Red-flanked
variety (E. atricapilla) is less hardy than the White-breasted and
requires its natural grass seeds for some time before getting used to
millet, otherwise it wdll not survive, whereas the White-breasted will
eat millet straight away and thrive on it. Both varieties look
exceedingly pretty swinging on the long grass stems in the bright
sunlight, while searching fcr seeds in the tips. They are found in the
forest clearings and palm-nut groves, i.e. anywhere where there is
sufficient light for grass to grow, but they are not found in open country,
and I never saw them in the centre of large forest clearings, but always
where cover and shade were close at hand.
The Green Spotted Waxbill (Mandingoa nitidula schlegeli) is much
brighter than the typical form (M. n. nitidula), a pair of which I brought
from Tanganyika two years ago. It is also much more plentiful, but
can hardly be . called a common bird. I found them to be very local
and to have an unaccountable affinity for one exceedingly small area
which looked exactly the same as hundreds of others. The two dozen

C. S. Webb--A Collector in French Cameroon
which I caught were all obtained in a palm-nut grove, which was thick
with bushes and coarse grasses, and all within a radius of 100 yards.
They are one of the most difficult birds to observe owing to their shy
and retiring habits, and there must be few people who have approached
these birds close enough to see their white spots with the naked eye.
The slightest disturbance is sufficient to frighten them to another
thick clump of vegetation, where they conceal themselves. In these
situations they feed unseen on fallen seeds. They are usually solitary
or in pairs, but by baiting places with millet in thickets for a period
several would be found feeding together, although any disturbance would
cause them to split up again. By crawling slowly on my hands and
knees on a path which I had worn through the vegetation I approached
several times within a few yards of these Waxbills feeding on a baited
patch. They display great nervousness at all times and seem to be
constantly in expectation of an attack by some natural enemy. They
are very pugnacious little birds and cannot be caged together at random.
After a lot of trials pairs may be found to suit each other and then there
is no further trouble, but they seem to have individual ideas as to what
is a suitable companion. It does not take many seconds when a pair
is put together to prove whether it is " love at first sight " or war.
They are caught by putting a wire netting cage shaped like a fish-trap
over a patch which has been baited.
The Gaboon Blue-billed Weavers (Spermophaga hasmatina pustulata),
although also very shy, are nevertheless frequently seen flying from
one thick patch of vegetation to another, usually near water. Their
strong bills enable them to crack very hard seeds without difficulty,
but they must devour quite a lot of seed which has become softened
through lying on the wet earth. In a country with such a big rainfall
and a humid atmosphere it could hardly be otherwise. My experience
has been that hard millet alone causes enteritis in these birds and they
soon develop a craving for mealworms, which they will not eat when
first caught. I have no evidence that they eat anything but seed (and
sand) in their wild state, so their taste for mealworms is probably
brought about by the lack of soft " milky " seeds. If a regular supply
of mealworms is given in conjunction with millet they keep perfectly
healthy. I do not know if this applies to Blue-billed Weavers which

have been in captivity for a long time, when they may gradually get
accustomed to a dry diet.
Another beautiful bird of similar build with a very thick bill is the
Crimson Seed-cracker [Pirenestes ostrinus). It was exceedingly rare at
Eseka and I only managed to get one pair. This striking bird has the
head and neck glossy crimson, shining like satin, the upper breast,
flanks, and tail are also crimson, contrasting with the velvety black back
and under parts. It is quite hardy in captivity, and thrives well on large
millet and canary seed. I was disappointed at not being able to get
more specimens, but in spite of setting nets in all the likely looking
haunts, i.e. thick, rank vegetation in swampy places, I met with no
more success. While on the subject of Estrildine birds, the well-known
Orange-cheeked Waxbills ( Estrilda melpoda) were frequently met with,
but were not so plentiful as the Black-capped Waxbills. All the Wax-
bills look much more beautiful in their wild state when feeding in flocks,
and this applies especially to Orange-cheeked Waxbills.
Bronze-wing Mannikins ( Spermestes cucullatus) were common in the
more open situations. Weaver birds appear to be the commonest of all
birds in the palm-nut growing districts of French Cameroon. The native
villages are alive with them, especially Yieillot's Black Weaver ( Ploceus
nigerrimus ), which is very numerous and breeds in colonies in trees
usually situated right among the native huts. They seem to spend all
their lives building nests and there is a ceaseless procession of these
birds to the palm-trees, where they strip ofl long thin pieces of fibrous
leaves and fly with these trailing through the air. Their nesting sites
are always scenes of great activity, with a tremendous noise going on
all the time.
The Y-marked Weavers [Ploceus cucullatus ), the males of which are
mainly yellow with black heads, have also a preference for nesting in
native villages, and like the foregoing species seem to spend most of their
time juggling with nesting material. There are many other Weavers
in the French Cameroon belonging to the genus Ploceus , but most of
them are more retiring than the two species mentioned and consequently
far less conspicuous.
Of greater interest to me were the Weavers of the genus Malimbus.
All these have black in their plumage, usually in conjunction with red,
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.978902891891892" page_id="56321766"  page_num="6" year="" vol="">
C. S. Webb--A Collector in French Cameroon
and the females of some species are entirely black. Even the young
birds have the black markings, which makes them generically distinct
from other Weavers. They are entirely insectivorous and spend their
lives in the high tree-tops searching for food among the leaves. In
consequence they are difficult to capture alive. The three species which
I obtained were the Crested Malimbus [Malimbus malimbicus), Blue-
billed Malimbus [M. nitens), and the Black-throated Malimbus [M.
cassini).
The Negro Finches [Nigrita) are another interesting group. They
all subsist on insects and the oily husk of palm-nuts. The Grey-headed
Negro Finch ( Nigrita canicapilla) has the forehead and under parts
black with grey upper parts and black wings with white spots. This
bird is very handsome and is full of character. It also has very pleasant
call-notes and once these are learnt it becomes apparent that these
birds are not at all uncommon, though very inconspicuous in their
natural surroundings. The first pair which I saw flew up from the
ground and I found that they had been feeding on the fleshy husk of
fallen palm-nuts. By setting nets in the surrounding vegetation I
managed to catch them when they returned the following morning.
For a while they have to be given this oily flesh which surrounds the
palm-nut, until they take to insectivorous food, and even then it is
better to mix a little crude palm-oil with it. There is something very
charming about Grey-headed Negro Finches, and I regarded them as
one of the nicest 44 seed-eaters " I have ever collected.
There is one species of Negro Finch, the Chestnut-breasted [Nigrita
bicolor), which might easily be taken for a Firefinch [Lagonosticta).
It was rather uncommon at Eseka and I only saw a few single specimens.
Negro Finches are not gregarious, and all those I saw were singly or
in pairs.
The third species of Negro Finch which I collected--the White-
breasted (. Nigrita fusconata) --is a small black and white bird with
graduated tail feathers. Like the others it is very fond of palm-nut husk.
The Cameroon forest contains some fine Sunbirds, the most note-
worthy being the Superb Sunbird [Cinnyris superbus). Its name is a
very fitting one. This bird can occasionally be seen feeding on banana
and paw-paw flowers in the native plantations in the forest, but it has

no regular feeding places, and so it requires a good deal of patience and
hard work before any success attends one's efforts at trapping. I
thought I was very fortunate to get three. It is well known to the natives
on account of its striking beauty, and in the Eseka district is known as
Njok Etong.
I have often thought what a wonderful display the larger African
Sunbirds would make in an aviary. This species, together with the
Malachite ( Nectarinia famosa), the Tacazze (IV. tacazze), the Golden-
winged ( Drepanorhynchus reichenowi), and the Scarlet-tufted Malachite
Sunbird {Nectarinia johnstoni), would make a delightful collection which
I think would surpass any collection of Humming-birds which we have
so far seen, that is when displayed in a tropical house. In contrast to
the Superb Sunbird the Olive-bellied {Cinnyris chloropygius) is very
common, but only in the second-growth and native gardens. Although
small, their beauty is very striking and in the brilliant tropical sunlight
they shine like jewels. The native children snare them when they
come to feed oh the lantana flowers. Dozens were brought to me, but I
liberated nearly , all of them after examination. The idea of looking
closely at them was to discover if any might belong to another very
similar species which is very rare. This is the Tiny Sunbird ( Cinnyris
minullus ), which is only slightly smaller than the Olive-bellied and
the red on the breast is lightly infused with blue. Only one was
obtained.
Another species which I found to be very scarce at Eseka was the
Green-throated Sunbird [Chalcomitra angolensis). It is a very sleek
bird with velvety-brown plumage, with the forehead and throat
metallic green, bordered by violet and blue respectively. I was
fortunate to get the only one that I saw of this very handsome species.
Several other kinds of Sunbirds were obtained belonging to the genera
Anthreptes and Cyanomitra, but were not so beautiful as those
previously mentioned.
Of the larger forest-dwelling birds the most conspicuous were the
Touracous and Hornbills. The Giant or Blue Touracou was often seen
singly or in small parties feeding on berries. In the Cameroon forest
the trees are so high that it is almost impossible to get near these arboreal
birds by ordinary means. Hardly any trees have branches within

fifty feet of the ground, and there are so many trees bearing fruits or
berries that it is sheer luck if these birds visit any particular tree, which
makes the trapping of them exceedingly difficult. Invariably any net
or trap set for Touracous in the forest catches one or more of the host of
small birds--principally Bulbuls--that congregate to feed on the berries.
The Blue Touracou is much larger than the other members of the family
and has a tail about 15 inches long and a large crest. It is widely
distributed, being found from the Gold Coast across to Uganda. It
must be more easy to procure in regions where the forest trees are
comparatively small.
The most noticeable Hornbill near Eseka was the Black Hornbill
(Ceratogymna atrata). It makes a loud noise with its wings when in flight,
and has a very powerful voice. It has a large casque and blue wattles.
There are several species of dwarf Kingfishers in Cameroon, all of
which are very beautiful. I was successful in hand-rearing three Pygmy
Kingfishers (Ispidina picta) taken from the nest. They are insectivorous
and frequently inhabit thick forest away from water, although I have
seen them in all sorts of country in different parts of Africa. Their
diminutive size and exquisite beauty is a source of wonder to anyone
seeing them for the first time.
Just as small are the quaint little Tinker-birds ( Pogoniulus ), which
are dwarf Barbets. There are several species, and the plumage is usually
black and yellow with white or yellow stripes on the head. Some of
them have a monotonous call, which is merely the repetition of the same
note like someone tapping on a piece of iron. Like the larger Barbets,
they nest in holes in decaying trees. The entrance holes are incredibly
small and are only large enough to admit one finger. Some of the
Tinker-birds become tame very quickly in captivity and make amusing
pets. When they are newly caught it is better to provide a small box
with a tiny hole in it, inside their cage, so that they can hide when
anyone approaches and to sleep in, otherwise they are very difficult to
keep alive.
Two of the most attractive birds that I brought from Cameroon
were the Fiery-breasted Bush Shrike (Malaconotus cruentus) and the
Chestnut-crowned Bush Shrike ( Laniarius luhderi). The former was a
very handsome bird, as can be seen by the coloured plate of it that

appeared in the Avicultural Magazine. This was a female--the male
was slightly brighter, but in catching it in a net it bit its own foot so
badly that I had to destroy the bird, which is evidence of the damage
that can be done with their powerful hooked bills. Most of the Bush
Shrikes have very pleasing call-notes, and become very tame, but they
are not the sort of birds to put into an aviary with anything smaller
than themselves.
In conclusion I will mention a few Robin Chats. The Forest Robin
(Stiphrornis erythrothorax) is a sprightly little bird that inhabits the
forest undergrowth. It is slaty brown above, with an orange crop and
yellow under parts. The white spot before each eye reminds one of the
White-starred Bush Robin (. Pogonocichla stellata) from South and East
Africa. The Blue-shouldered Robin Chat ( Cossypha cyanocampter)
and the White-headed Robin Chat ( C . niveicapilla) are much larger
and are both handsome birds. They are found in the second-growth
thickets, i.e. where the forest has been cleared and a different dense
vegetation interlaced with creepers and weedy growths has sprung up.
It is very difficult to discover the haunts of birds that live in this almost
impenetrable mass, for they can hardly ever be seen.
In his excellent Handbook of the Birds of West Africa , Bates, who
lived in Cameroon for many years, says of the second-growth : " These
plants may be called weeds, but they grow head-high and more and
are dense, and bound together with tangled vines, so as to be
impenetrable ; the weight and thick skin of an elephant or buffalo
are needed to tear through them. A man working his way in this tangle
where there is no path has to cut, tear, stoop, and crawl, and if he gets
on a few yards in half an hour his clothes will be torn, his
hands scratched, and his shirt wringing wet with sweat. ..." This gives
a good idea cf what has to be encountered when trapping the two Robin
Chats mentioned. After weeks of search I saw a Blue-shouldered
Robin Chat in similar vegetation, about 12 feet high, consisting of
bushes covered with vines and weeds. I crawled in through a tunnel--
an animal track--and sat perfectly still inside. After a few minutes a
Robin Chat perched almost beside me, much to my joy, as I now knew
its " home " and would have no great difficulty in getting it alive.
These brief notes are of some of the birds I collected alive (excepting

By A. C. Furner
Once again for the benefit of the members who are interested in
the doings of people like myself, who only keep the more ordinary
aviary birds, I am taking the liberty of retailing the season's breeding
and experiences, and although they savour a very little more of success
than previous years, breeding in my aviaries is still nothing to write
a story about.
After many years of trying we definitely seem to have laid the
Cockatiel bogey by the heels. For about ten years I have kept Cockatiel
and the first success was last year, when one bird had four healthy
young.
This year one of these young hens mated to a cock, purchased
in the spring, went to nest, and produced four healthy young ones,
their second nest being spoilt by an upheaval in the aviary due to
some birds getting out and my having to shut the Cockatiel in the
roost to get the strays home again.
The second pair of Cockatiel went to nest at the end of April,
but here again, due to my own fault, the nest was disturbed by my
introducing a pair of Crowned Wood Partridges into the aviary.
I was fortunate in obtaining this pair of Roulroul Partridges ( Rollulus
roulroul), which I understood were ground birds. They turned out,
however, to be anything but, and chose the highest points in the
aviary for roosting and recreation, principally the top of the Cockatiel's
nesting box. It has been my experience that when Cockatiel are
disturbed they seldom nest again successfully that year.

The Red-ramped Parrakeets went to nest in May, but before the
young were hatched we found the cock bird dead and the hen apparently
left the nest.
I immediately took the eggs and nesting log away, putting in a
new log and a new cock bird. Although I was very doubtful about
the reception which the new suitor would get, so soon after the first
husband's decease, all went quietly, and within a fortnight of putting
him in they had gone to nest, resulting in four young hens. As she
already had had the first misfortune I did not allow her to go a third
time.
It is rather interesting to note that during the last three years
out of ten young Red-rumps from this hen eight of them have been hens.
The pair of Swainson's Lorikeets which I obtained from separate
sources last year caused a good deal of excitement by laying three
eggs and sitting on them for four weeks, when they both lost interest
in the nest-box, and we found the eggs were clear. Here again they
made no further attempt, although they appear to be mating up again
this late time *of the year.
It has been a good season amongst the Lovebirds. A pair of Masked
that I have had for some years, and who have spent three parts of
their life sitting on eggs without hatching any, have produced two
young ones which have left the nest perfect, and they have gone to
nest again.
I attribute this success entirely to the Marquess of Tavistock's
definite preference for an outside nesting box, and it was at the second
time of nesting in this outside nest-box that the success occurred.
During practically the whole time of their incubation it poured with
rain, and I certainly propose next spring to put all my Lovebirds'
nesting boxes in the flight portion of the aviary instead of the roost.
In another aviary a Fischer cock mated to a Masked hen have
continued to produce their kind, and these birds have brought out
six sturdy youngsters since May, and are still keeping it up as the
hen bird is sitting again.
Another pair of Masked Lovebirds, purchased by me as a true
pair, have brought out four young which are most handsome little
birds but definitely not true Masked ; the yellow breast feathers

being an absolutely deep bronze and the black head feathers terminating
nearer to the eye than in the true Masked Lovebirds.
Amongst a collection of small Finches the only ones who attempted
anything interesting were three Masked Grass-finches, one cock bird
and two hens.
It was quite a communal family, and all three took an interest
in rearing and bringing out two youngsters, and although they lived
for seven weeks out of the nest to become strong flying birds, they
both met their end at the hands of either a cat or an owl, which appears
to have got at them through the wire netting and bitten off their
heads.
The Gouldians have until very recently proved very obstinate this
year. Years ago I kept my Gouldians in an outside aviary, and although
during five years I had never been without a pair of Gouldians, they
never even got as far as laying an egg.
After reading Mr. Teague's well-known and excellent article on
Gouldian Finches I caged them, when they immediately settled down
to domestic operations.
During the first year of caged life we bred five young from one pair ;
the second year seven young from one pair, and the third year fourteen
young from one pair. After that it was decided to put several pairs
up for breeding, and since that date we have never bred a young
Gouldian, and this summer I decided to put them out in the aviary
again.
Yesterday I heard young Gouldians squeaking in the nest, and so
I am once again undecided as to whether Gouldians breed better in
an aviary or a cage.
One other item of particular interest to myself, but yet another
tragedy : last autumn a friend presented me with a small Parrakeet
in a cage.
After sundry inquiries and reference to " Parrots and Parrot-like
Birds " this turned out to be a Kashmirian Moustached Parrakeet,
or alternatively a Javan Parrakeet.
Later in the year I was successful in obtaining a Javan Parrakeet
cock, when the first comer immediately proved herself to be a hen
by taking possession of the nesting box and starting to lay an egg.

Unfortunately she never completed the performance and died as a
result of an internal injury.
This was bitterly disappointing to myself as an amateur, as these
birds seem so rare nowadays, and although I have tried all known
methods of obtaining a hen, up to date I have been unsuccessful.
Whilst the above small incidents take very little space to write
and look very uninteresting when written, they have provided us with
a very full six months of interest, pleasure at success, disappointment
at failure, and hard work.

I have been asked if it is really so difficult to rear young Pheasants
as my article on disinfection of eggs seems to imply ? I never said
so, and no general reply is possible. But first I would point out
that mistaken conclusions have been arrived at.
I never advised scraping the shells of Pheasant eggs in order to
facilitate hatching. All I said was that cleansing the shell where it
has become soiled by contact with the hen might be useful against
umbilical infection when hatching. This cause of mortality is negligible
with common kinds, but the true fancier prides himself on not losing
even one chick of a rare species.
Scraping the shell gives no appreciable aid to hatching. I am not
a biologist like my friend M. Derscheid, so I dare not speak positively,
but this is what long experience leads me to believe. The actual
hatching of a chick is more intimately connected with its movements
in the egg than with its actual pecking at the shell. The chick
which hatches out easily begins by pecking lightly at one spot. Then
it stops. Presently it turns ; and begins to work at another place
and gradually makes a line of attempts. A chick, on the contrary,
which starts by making a large hole and continues to enlarge it often
ends by not hatching. It does not lack strength , for it has made a
larger hole than is necessary. Of course, thinning the shell would

technically make it more easily broken, but the lively chick has no
need of this assistance. The only reason for scraping the egg is to
cleanse soiled portions.
Supposing the eggshell is too thick ? Even here it is useless. It
is not because the thick shell is too hard to pierce, but because it
prevents evaporation from the chick of the water engendered during
incubation, and at the moment of the actual hatching this extra water
makes it too swollen to escape.
Difficulties in rearing Pheasants vary according to circumstances
and also according to the treatment given by the breeder. " Circum-
stances " stand for the condition of the parent, the weather, exposure,
and, above all, the soil.
In fairly good weather and above all on a non-clayey soil breeding
is often quite easy. A light soil is best, and the ideal is to change it
every time. But I have sometimes known novices rear birds quite
successfully under conditions where I would have declared not a single
chick would be reared. This summer a man showed me a box con-
taining a sheet of newspaper, and on it six ring-necks with their hen
foster-mother. The Pheasants were six weeks old and not in bad
condition. This is one of those lessons in humility which providence
bestows on specialists. It is within the power of every fancier to
rear a fair percentage of Pheasant provided the weather is passable
and the ground and silkies are healthy. This alas ! is not our lot!
Our ground is so bad that even the bam door fowl chicks do badly
on it.
For all that we are determined to reach and do reach about 96 per
cent success with rare Pheasants no matter what the weather or the
season. But it must be understood that the difficulty increases, and,
as I remarked before, results vary.
II. Should Firebacks have heat in winter ? Decidedly not. It is
useless, and probably bad for them. I gave my opinion on this question
in the February, 1936, number of the Avicultural Magazine, and
I have repeated it for the readers of the O.P.S. Journal.
It is true that I only have experience of the Siamese, Bornean
Crested, and Yieillot's Firebacks, but in all probability the other
species require the same treatment.

It may become necessary to heat animals in winter, but it is dangerous.
Naturally, one must guard against too great cold in wintry weather,
but the temperature should nevertheless remain wintry. If not, one
risks mixing the seasons altogether, and they are always too little
divided in our variable climate. First-class apparatus and careful
control are required, for the too pronounced alternations of heat and
cold in winter disturb the natural impulses of animal life and cause
them to manifest themselves at the wrong times.
No. Firebacks should not be heated in winter, but must be kept
sheltered from frost and snow ; no more. Treat them like poultry
which are not allowed to sleep out in winter. Copy Mr. Paul Schmidt,
who keeps his birds through the terrible winters of Yugoslavia. He
shuts up his Firebacks in pens where the ground is covered with a thick
litter of straw to keep their feet from freezing by coming in contact
with the icy ground. In our climate there is no need to do as much.
Our Firebacks are kept in ordinary aviaries with no further protection
against the weather than a simple cubic box about 2J feet long. The
box is very dry because it is lined with asbestos cardboard, double-
bottomed and furnished with a thick well-pressed layer of straw.
Throughout the winter (and even in spring if it is cold) the birds are
shut into these boxes every evening and released in the morning.
The boxes cost practically nothing, take up little room, and keep
the birds in perfect health without heat and without trouble. Try
it and you will see. Your birds will not suffer in the least from the
winter and you need no longer wait until the middle of summer for
possible breeding results. By the 10th May even if there is still frost
you will have eggs.
I am at the service of fanciers who wish to know the cheap and
simple sort of box used here.

By Dr. E. Hopkinson
The Fathers of Aviculture, or, rather, of avicultural writing, and
the inspirers of most of the later writers, are Albin in England and
Bechstein in Germany, both of the eighteenth century. In the
nineteenth century the output of such works was, of course, large, but
it is probably not generally realized that the previous century produced
quite a large number. The following is an attempt to provide a more or
less annotated list of these.
A good many of the books mentioned I know and I have used
the German bibliographies of Engelmann, Carus, and Taschenburg,
but for the particulars given I am mainly indebted to booksellers'
catalogues (especially the very fully annotated one issued by
Messrs. Sotheran in 1924), and for British Birds, to the Bibliography
op British Ornithology by W. H. Mullens and H. Kirke Swann
(Macmillan and Co., 1917).
Although I know there must be many sins of omission, I hope there
are few of commission, and that the whole may interest, and perhaps
be a step towards a real Bibliography of the subject, which the present
writer, with a collaborator, attempted thirty years ago (in Bird Notes),
but which I realize now was full of every kind of error and only useful
as a warning of how not to do it.

THE PEACOCK AS A PET
By Ian Harman
I wonder what has brought about the decline of the lordly Peafowl
as pets ? If you look up some old book with its engravings of ancient
parks and garden, there you will find at least a solitary Peacock sitting
in a commanding position on some stonework terrace.
Yet to-day there must be very few parks in which Peacocks roam--
certainly the L.C.C. do not seem to like them, and I cannot recollect

I. Harman--The Peacock as a Pet
having seen a single specimen in any of the great parks they control. In
private parks and gardens Waterfowl prevail, with Cranes as a next
best thing--but Peacocks, no ! I suppose it will be up to Ornamental
Pheasant fans--and may their tribe increase--to reintroduce the
Peacock to aviculturists and park owners.
Strange as it may seem to level-headed folks, one of the main reasons
why the Peacock is not liked as a living ornament of the lawn is pure
superstition. I am informed on good authority that many people,&apos;
especially ladies, simply won't be tempted to have one of these most
lovely of Pheasants about the home because they are " supposed to be
unlucky In this respect, may I remind my readers that, strictly
speaking, it is not the bird but its tail feathers (that is the train feathers,
really) which are unlucky when brought into the house. Possibly this
idea was spread about by someone who kept these birds and got tired
of having people pull out their feathers ! That is my idea as to how it
arose, anyway.
The Peacock must have been the first foreign bird to have been
brought to Britain. It was brought over by the Roman conquerors
as a table-bird, which it remained until well into the seventeenth
century. When it was first brought into Europe is a little uncertain.
It was, however, known in Palestine in Solomon's time, and, as it is
always associated with Juno, the Greek Queen of Heaven, we can
presume that it was known more than four hundred years b.c.
Though the Peacock has always lived a semi-domesticated state in
the West, it is still found in a wild state in certain parts of India and
Ceylon. At liberty as a wildling, the Peafowl is an inhabitant of fairly
thick jungle, especially where it is intersected by small rivers and
streams and varied with low ranges of hills. In such jungles the birds
live in small parties (says Hugh Whistler), resting and lazily feeding
in the undergrowth by day, roosting on the trees at night, and when
surroundings permit moving out into cultivation for the morning and
evening feed. They are very wary and shy, running swiftly on foot
amongst the bushes when approached, and being persuaded to fly
with the utmost difficulty ; though once on the wing they can travel
fast with regular flaps of comparatively slow beat, sustained and
without the gliding motion common to most game birds.

Yet, though normally such a shy bird, the Peacock is intelligent
and soon knows when it can trust man. In the drier parts of north-
western India, where it is introduced, it has become very common, and
as sentiment and religion of the natives combine to afford the bird
complete protection, it has become tame in that area, living in droves
on the outskirts of villages and feeding in the fields with an almost
complete disregard of passers-by.
The Peacock is polygamous, and the harem consists of from two
to five hens, and he takes no share in the family duties. The nest of the
Peahen is simply a hollow scraped in the ground and more or less filled
with leaves, small sticks, grass, and other debris. Sometimes, however,
a bird will nest in hollows of tree-branches or even in deserted Vulture's
nests. I should like to know how the young birds get down in the latter
case, as being active they would be sure to go " overboard " when a
few days old.
The Peacock has never become more than partially domesticated,
and this may be due to the fact that, like the Turkey, the chicks are
very delicate creatures until about half grown up, and have to be
protected from the rigours of our climate, which, however, the adult
birds stand so well. Peacocks reared in a park or farmyard become very
tame and make themselves at home, and seldom evince the least desire
to stray, yet they never adapt themselves to domestication as the
offspring of the Red Jungle Fowl has done.
I might mention here that the wonderful " tail " which the Peacock
displays is not a tail at all, but is composed of enormously elongated
tail-covert feathers, and the true tail is short and stiff and is said to help
to support the train. The spreading of the train is primarily intended
to fascinate the Peahen during the courting season, but the Peacock
frequently spreads it for human admiration when no hens are in sight.
The bird also spreads the train when attacking an enemy.
The marvellous glittering iridescence of the Peacock's feathers is
another extremely interesting point. There is not a scrap of colouring
matter in any of them, and the colour is purely reflected light. The
feathers are covered with myriads of tiny prisms. These are arranged
in definite patterns, and when the white light strikes them it is broken
up into the seven colours of the spectrum--violet, indigo, blue, green,

yellow, orange, and red. These colours are then reflected back to
our eyes.
As so frequently happens when a bird is taken in hand by man, a
number of freak forms of the Peafowl have been bred. There is, for
instance, a white variety, a pied form, and one sometimes miscalled
the " Japan " variety. This latter should be " Japanned ", in reference
to the black shoulders. It is also called the Black-winged form. None
of these is so handsome as the original. The Burmese Peafowl is a
distinct race.
Now as to keeping a Peacock as a pet. If you have a vegetable
garden and pride yourself on keeping the kitchen well supplied, then
you will have to take Mr. Punch's famous advice for those about to
be married ! But in a flower garden a Peacock will not do much damage,
though the writer came across an odd hen who made a regular habit of
eating nasturtium seeds.
The little misdeeds of Peafowl are easily compensated for by their
many excellent qualities. They are very strongly attached to their
homes, and are not given to wandering. They are intelligent birds
with intriguing habits.
With regard to breeding, and if the hen lays and sits on five or six
eggs, you must not expect to raise more than two or three young birds.
The eggs can be placed under a foster parent.
The Peafowl is almost omnivorous in its dietery and can be given
all sorts of table scraps, supplemented with a certain amount of chicken
food. They must have greenstuff. Scraps such as cheese rinds and
breadcrusts should be cut up small before being fed to the birds. Your
chicks, when you have any, will need a more classy diet. The mother
will find insect fare for them, and as they grow older they will grub for
themselves. But they should be given a hard-boiled egg chopped up
into small pieces, ant's eggs, and chick-meal, sold for rearing ordinary
chickens on. Any which "go off colour " might be revived by a diet
of the yolk of egg chopped up with biscuit meal.
Peacocks are smart birds when it comes to filling their stomachs.
If you have them in a large area of ground--and you can only keep these
birds satisfactorily under conditions of almost complete liberty--they will
find most of their food for themselves. Give them a few scraps as titbits

regularly, and a daily feed with corn and chicken food. Some time ago
there was a famous muster of Peacocks in the grounds of a big house
on the Cotswolds, and the birds became so tame that passing motorists
would stop to feed them. In a short time the birds grew accustomed to
this, and if a motorist unconsciously stopped along that road he would
shortly find himself surrounded by a mob of hungry Peafowl, screaming
loudly for food !
When you buy a young pair of Peacocks you had better pen them up
for a week or so until they get used to their new home, but afterwards,
when they know it, the birds will never leave it, and will find a regular
roosting place in a nearby tree, where they will retire at night as
regularly as rooks. It is quite useless to cut their wings and unnecessary.
The value of a full-grown Peacock is about #2 or #3, and you can always
find a market for the birds as not many people breed them.

By K. Drake
I was very amused at an article I read a short time back in which
a certain w r riter on foreign birds seemed to regret that so few failures
were recorded, whilst in all the books and magazines he had read
quite 80 per cent were successes and only 20 per cent failures. I myself
strongly object to dwell on the failures, and had my husband read
of many failures in the magazines I am quite positive I should never
have become a member of the Avicultural Society. I tell him of all

K. Drake--Failures versus Successes
the birds soon arrive ! Now, honestly, if he read of many failures
I know I should not have got those new birds. Instead, I should
probably have heard words like these, " Don't you think it is time you
gave up that bird hobby, surely it is only a rich man's hobby ? " etc.
No, I emphatically say. Let us hear of all the successes we can, and
cover up most of the failures one does not want to dwell on too much
sickness and death, let us rather hear of the joys and successes of
life. One is bound to have failures with England's inclement weather.
In the article is also stated " the new recruit to the fancy does
not, therefore, understand that things are not always quite as easy,
or as rosy, as it might appear ". Now, if a new recruit heard of many
failures, it is not likely there would be many new recruits, also, if a new
recruit does not realize that a bird arriving from the Tropics needs
great care, I think he or she had far better be content with Canaries
and Budgerigars. I remember well when I arrived in England from the
Tropics how I was wrapped in " prickly " woollen garments, and my
diet seemed to consist mainly of porridge, dripping, butter, and cod-
liver oil ! the awful penalty of being born in the Tropics ! Well, the
birds have to go through it too. Oh, I really cannot forget the wearing
of that awful " respirator " (it is called by that name because one cannot
" respirate " through it !), but I should not recommend putting one
on a bird. Please don't, as I feel sure we were compelled to wear the
hateful things only to stop our bad language on the English weather,
the restricted houses, and oh, those prickly, scratchy garments ! Now
the writer goes on to say, " successes are not always due to the cleverness
of the breeder, but in getting a pair of birds that will breed." I do
not like the word " cleverness ", but I do think a great deal of the
success of breeding is due to the study and understanding of the birds
by the breeder and of their care, food, etc.
This is merely my opinion, let others give theirs if they will.

By Dr. G. Steinbacher
The European Capercaillie, Black Cock, Grouse, and Hazel Grouse
are very seldom found in captivity. It is very difficult to keep them.
Our Zoological Gardens of Berlin show them nearly continually, and
I am certain many amateurs will be interested in how they are kept
*and bred here.
The difficulties of keeping these interesting birds already begin with
getting them. Eggs or youngsters of wild birds are seldom found,
and even then the young ones are very delicate. It is hard work to
rear them. During the first week they thrive comparatively well,
but afterwards they cease growing, sicken, and soon die. Their food
;seems to lack an essential substance. But there are also great difficulties
in catching the wild birds and accustoming them to being kept in
cages. Their wings must be clipped, otherwise, if frightened, they will
dash themselves to death. And their cages must be closely planted
in order to give them enough cover. Moreover, they most probably
can only get accustomed to being kept in captivity by being given
for a long time the same food they found in freedom. But the catching
\0x25A0of these birds is chiefly prevented by the fact that they are only frequent
enough in a few districts in Scandinavia and the south-east of Europe,
and even there it is often forbidden to catch them.
But even when possible to get some of these birds, which are accus-
tomed to being caged, it will pay to clip their wings. For in the new
surroundings they at first are easily frightened and then are liable
to hurt themselves. The birds are put into large cages with boughs of
fir and pine laid out with fresh forest soil. This soil is cut in the forest
and brought into the cages with all its animals and plants, especially
bilberries and wortleberries. The birds will eat much of these herbs
and be busy picking about in the soil. Though the cages are placed
in sunshine, they provide their inhabitants with cool and shady nooks
in great heat. There are also indoor pens, in which the birds are some-
times fed, and into which they are put while their cages are cleaned
*and the soil is renewed.

Col. Hudson--Jealous Cockatoos
Their food is mashed maize, barley, oats, Spratt's pheasant food
(moistened), cooked and chopped carrots, sliced bread, mashed earth-
nuts, bilberries, wortleberries and other berries, a few meal-worms, and
in summer fresh ants' pupae. As green food they get dandelion and
milfoil.
Capercaillies eat many buds and leaves of the&apos; boughs of firs and
pines, while Black Cocks want a lot of birch branches, the buds of
which they like very much. The Grouse are fed on many berries and
more meal-worms. The Hazel Grouse especially like fruit and grapes,
and get smaller seeds, like millet, hemp, and so on. If the birds get
used to confinement, they will often live a long time and show all
those habits which are so attractive to the huntsman. The strangely
low pairing call of the cock Capercaillie can be observed from a short
distance, in the same way as the gobbling of the Black Cock and the
harsh cry of the Grouse. The red spots on the head of the cocks can
be seen swelling, the Grouse changing in colour from brown in summer
to white in winter and the Capercaillie moulting its bill.
Thus it is very interesting to keep these birds in captivity. It is
worth while to take all the trouble. In the Berlin Zoo Capercaillies,
Black Hens, and Grouse even laid eggs and hatched out young ones.

I thought that this photo of my C. galerita and roseicapillus, both
males, might be of interest as examples of affection and jealousy in
very tame birds, both of which fly yet neither have chain nor cage.
Every time one monopolizes its master the other turns away in
disgust until occasionally the game terminates in a painful manner,
when each, annoyed at the lack of attention, seizes an ear--and
although blood is never drawn the bilateral attack is not pleasant.
The birds will sit for hours, one on each shoulder, and even during
a nap can be relied upon to remain in situ. Left alone within reach of
each other hostilities commence at once.

One of the most satisfactory features which goes to prove the
progress of our Society is the fact that so many Pheasant lovers (not
necessarily Pheasant keepers) of far-off countries are joining the O.P.S.
Quite recently we have enrolled members from New Zealand, Australia,
South Africa, Japan, and many from the Continent. Our activities are
making a world-wide appeal; we always intended that the O.P.S.
should not be confined to Great Britain, and it is a mistaken idea that
such is the case. Reading some notes the other day in an American
magazine devoted to aviculture I was a little surprised to note that our
Society was spoken of as the " British O.P.S I hope some of our
American friends who may happen to read these notes will remember
that we are not insular in our activities, but, on the contrary, we want
members from every quarter of the globe, and the letters " O.P.S. "
refer to the world. We were most pleased to note that America has
formed its own O.P.S., but we must insist that our Society shall not be
called British. Up to date we have not received the support from many
bird lovers who, although not keeping Pheasants in their aviaries, would,
we hoped, show their appreciation of our efEorts by joining our O.P.S.
This is to be regretted, but we still live in hopes that many bird lovers
of the Avicultural Society will help us by joining. I heard quite recently
that the O.P.S. was set up in opposition to the Avicultural Society ;
this remark made me smile. Of course, you all know that nothing of the
sort was ever contemplated ; far from this being the case, we always do
our best to help, may I say our Parent Society, by lending the
Avicultural Magazine free of charge to many of our members. If
we were in any way opposed to your great Society, should we have the
active support of Monsieur Delacour, who is now our President ? If
this foolish idea has got abroad amongst your members please allow
me to contradict it most emphatically. We are most anxious to help
the Avicultural Society in every way possible, and we in our turn do
hope that you will help us. I will again remind you that my address is
Wellesbourne, Warwick, and the subscription is only 6s. per annum.
May I suggest that a most suitable New Year gift to our Society would
be a memo, to say you wish to join the O.P.S.

THE NESTING OF THE KAGU

<bodyText confidence="0.998251481481481" page_id="56321798"  page_num="30" year="" vol="">
By kind permission of Mrs. Dunn.
Madam, --It was in April, 1936, that my employer purchased a pair of
these charming and interesting birds. They were placed in a large aviary
with a small shelter attached. They quickly settled down, and during the
early summer had a perfect moult and became quite tame. It was, however,
not until late August that the cock commenced to utter his loud and curious
call; to me it sounds like the barking of a dog, and can be heard a long way
off. As the season was so far advanced, I never thought that they would
attempt to breed this year. Judge my surprise, however, when in early October
I noticed the cock was interesting himself in carrying dried leaves and grass
under a small bush. On 14th October a beautiful nest was completed, and
next day the egg was laid. It was a large egg, as big as a hen's, creamy-white
splashed with brown and black streaks. Both birds took part in incubation,
the hen sitting by day and the male at night. The weather was now bad and
I had but little hope of their hatching it out. However, after sitting for close
upon thirty-six days a fine chick was hatched. The weather now was bitterly
cold, and I intended at the first chance to drive the parents and chick into the
warm shelter, but it was not to be. After living about an hour, the chick
suddenly died and our hopes were dashed to the ground. However, it was a
fine attempt and I am almost certain that had the egg been laid during the
summer we might have been lucky enough to have reared this wonderful and
beautiful species. I sent the dead chick to Mr. Seth-Smith for inspection.
This was one more disappointment, but still there is another chance. I only
hope that the birds live and do well and that they will decide to lay early
next year.

REPLY TO MR. FROST
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9926701875" page_id="56321798"  page_num="30" year="" vol="">
Madam, --The first statement in Mr. Frost's letter regarding my remarks
about the bird shops in Singapore is rather contradictory. Why, if the shops
(about five in number) are so excellently kept, do they need the strict super-
vision of a European Police Officer " especially detailed to that duty " ?
It would seem that the Government do not think quite as enthusiastically
about the way the Chinese look after their birds as Mr. Frost does. I know
they don't after conversing with the person whose advice the Government
takes in this matter.
Of course, people's ideas as to how birds should be kept is apt to differ.
Personally I like to see them kept clean and given food upon which they will
subsist. I never saw anything but rice given to Parrots and Finches, and I
certainly saw many Long-tailed and Blue-rumped Parrots dying from
starvation owing to being fed solely on rice.
I made no comparison between the bird shops here and the ones in
Singapore. Frankly I will admit that the ones in Singapore could give certain
shops here points--unfortunately !

A stranger often gets a sharper impression than one who through constant
association has had bis critical faculties dulled. No doubt thirty years'
association with the bird shops of the Far East might blunt my susceptibilities
to the sufferings of the birds.
It is a strange thing that if the Chinese in Singapore are such adepts at
keeping birds that it is impossible to buy any kind of " soft food " except
" dried flies ", and also that one never sees such birds as Chats, Robins, Sun-
birds, Pittas, and the like, in the shops. In fact, I asked for these birds,
especially Pittas, as they are my favourites and abound in Malaya, but I was
told that they were not kept as the owners of the shops did not know how to
feed them ! I would ask Mr. Frost how many " Softbiils " other than Mynahs
and Bulbuls he has procured in his dealings with the Chinese in Singapore.
Mr. Frost, speaking about my lamentable lack of knowledge regarding the
trapping of Pheasants, says: " If the writer had even the foggiest notion of the
methods employed he would realize the utter improbability of a Pheasant
ever being noosed by the neck." As recently as July, Mons. I)elacour, writing;
in the Magazine about the trapping of the Crested Argus, says : " The natives
build miles of low hurdles across the forest with an opening every twenty or
thirty yards : a snare made of a flexible vine is set at each opening. The birds
run along the hurdles and try to get out through the openings, when they are
caught by the leg. They are captured alive unless some carnivorous mammal
comes and kills them before they are found. But often their legs are ' ringed '
or injured, and in that case the bird never recovers. Sometimes snares are
baited with paddy or fruit: the bird is then caught by the neck and almost always
killed." (The italics are mine.) And if Mons. Delacour's word is to be taken,
and I am sure it is, for few people know more about Pheasants than he does
both here and in the Far East, Mr. Frost, in spite of his thirty years or so
contact with the Far East, and also having recently been to the very home of
the Crested Argus, still has something to learn about the way Pheasants are
trapped.
I can only say that all the birds I purchased, Argus and Firebacks, from
the shops, died from disease in a short time after I purchased them. None of
the twenty or so which I purchased from the derided " Zoo " died, and I landed
all in this country safely. The Argus Pheasants which I saw in the shops were
kept in baskets only large enough for fowls and they were unable to stand
upright. They were fed solely on rice, which was thrown in from the top on to
the filth on the bottom of the baskets. Fifty per cent of the Pheasants which
I saw in Singapore in the shops and the " Zoo " were maimed, this consisting
mainly of broken and twisted legs, due, I was told, to the trapping by nooses.
I brought home several bamboo perches on which Parrots are chained ;
these measure 4 inches in length. I saw one large crate of Black-capped
Lories--all the birds looked as though they had been dipped in rice pudding
and then dried ; not many survived at the end of a month. I have several
Eclectus whose legs are nearly severed owing to the tightness of the chains
attached to them.
Lastly, I think that the majority of humane aviculturists who like to
see birds decently kept would share my condemnation if they but saw the
bird shops of Singapore.

Madam, --With reference to page 251 of the September number of the
Avicultural Magazine, " The Breeding of Hoopoes."
Mark Armstein had a tailoring establishment at the corner of George's
Street and The Grand Parade, in Cork. On many occasions I visited his
living quarters above the shop. My recollection is that there were birds
everywhere, and the aviary was quite a small room--though at this date
I could not give even approximate dimensions.
He had a wonderful variety of birds, and I remember quite distinctly
being introduced to the young Hoopoes and, later, being shown the Medal
presented for breeding them.

creatures no bigger than my thumb about with me almost all day long ; they
are so pretty ; and it is so nice to weaken in the morning and hear them sing."
Later on he again mentions his pets, and we then learn that they were
Silverbills. He writes :--
"I once had two of these pigmies in captivity; and in the quiet, bare
house upon the silent street where I was then living, their song, which was
not much louder than a bee's, but airily musical, kept me in a perpetual
good humour. I put the cage upon my table when I worked, carried it with
me when I went for meals, and kept it by my bed at night; the first thing
in the morning these maestrini would pipe up."

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed
account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from the date
of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the Executive
Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the
young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent
of their parents. No medal can be given for the breeding of hybrids, or of local
races or sub-species of species that have already been bred.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine before
it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of the young,
and be of value as a &apos;permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the species.
These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal
is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have been
awarded as possible.

(Bucco colaris)
By P. H. Maxwell
The photograph of this bird is taken from Sclater's monograph of the
Jacamars and Puff-birds by kind permission of Mr. W. L. Sclater.
There is a specimen of this bird in the bird galleries of the Natural
History Museum, London. I also have a print of it but my print does
not seem very accurate as regards the pigmentation. The following is
a description of it: the sexes are alike.
Above bright rusty red, crossed with black linear bands except on the
sides of the head ; dorsal band black ; wings, blackish ; coverts,
external secondaries and tail like the back ; beneath white ; abdomen,
washed with ochraceous ; pectoral band, black ; bill, orange-red ;
culmen, blackish ; feet, brown ; whole length 7 inches, wings 3*2,
tail 6, bill horn gape 1*4.
The habitat of this bird is G-uiana and Amazonia : it is found mostly
in hilly and dry districts and is often seen near the ground hunting for
beetles and other insects.
Mr. H. Whitley collected this bird at Yquitos, East Peru, in fact he
was one of the first collectors to obtain specimens of this bird. Mr. Bates
says of the genus Bucco, in his book A Naturalist on the Amazons, " they

In Hong Kong one gets a first peep at the swarming millions of
China and meets with the traditional smells, poverty, and squalor of
that vast empire. It was hard to realize upon arriving in Hong Kong
that this city is well within the Tropics. Sometimes I was given to under-
stand the cold is intense, though judging by the amount of tropical
flowers that one sees blooming one would think that the reports were
rather exaggerated. In the city there appeared to be only three bird
shops, two very poor, and the other hardly what one would call " high
class Here the Java Sparrows of Singapore gave place to Pekin
Bobins, thousands upon thousands of them, cramped in terribly
inadequate cages, though I must say that most of the birds looked in
fairly good condition, which says something for their constitutions.
In the best shop of the three I was glad to find a bird which I had
tried for years to obtain, the exquisite little Eastern Siberian Ruby-
throat, a Robin-like bird resembling a slim edition of the Nightingale
with a white stripe above the eye and a black and white one below ; on
the throat is a bib-like patch of intense ruby-red. This bird is a relative
of the better known Blue-throat. I secured all the dealer had, six in
number, including a semi-albino specimen with the lower parts white
and the upper parts mottled with white, the bib a beautiful salmon
colour. I rather think that the apparent albinism was due to mal-
nutrition, for after the bird moulted in my aviaries it resumed its normal
colourings, for which I was rather sorry. I found afterwards that it was
foolish to have purchased all my birds in Hong Kong, for I saw many
others in Northern China, where this species is a favourite cage-bird,
and those from the Northern districts would doubtless have been

hardier than the ones procured in the south, though had I not pur-
chased any in Hong Kong I doubt whether I should have found any
anywhere else. Life is like that, if one misses an opportunity it seldom
comes again. Many times I have been told, when I have seen something
in a certain port: " Oh, leave it until you get to so-and-so ; there are
much better ones there." In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred
there never were any more, and we regretted our lost opportunity and
cursed ourselves for taking other people's advice. But I don't think
I ever regretted purchasing my little Euby-throats. They were little
gems. They accompanied me on many months of wandering, and I
grew very fond of them. One or two of my birds had obviously been in
captivity for a long time, for their bibs were very much faded. They are
delicate birds and need more attention than the average " soft-bill ",
especially during the moult, when the birds are apt to go " light " and
die. They need a rich insectivorous food and plenty of live food. I
found that the coming in of wasp grubs just coincided with the moult,
and on these the birds mainly subsisted. How they manage to survive
so long in the Chinese shops I don't know, for they appear to be fed
on a dry meal composed of rice flour and ground " dried flies ". My
birds all became delightfully tame and will take food from one's fingers.
Only one of my birds sings, but what an exquisite song it is, soft,
sweet, and continuous. In the Philippine Islands, one of the winter
homes of this species, I heard, as I sat beside a small babbling brook,
the song coming from out of a dense tangle of tropical vegetation ; it
seemed like the faint and far-away echo of some soft sweet haunting
melody from a fairy musical box, breathing the spirit of a far-away golden
age when life was attuned to a gentler and more harmonious key.
Beside it even the song of the Nightingale seems coarse, at least it does
to my ears, but then we all have our own ideas regarding music. There
are few bird songs I have ever heard which appeal to me like the soft
strains of the Euby-throat.
Euby-throats are not uncommon in South China in the winter
time, having migrated thither from their summer home in Eastern
Siberia, Kamtschatka, and Northern China. They are of Eobin-like
demeanour, and are found in the low herbage searching for insects upon
which they feed.

Sydney Porter--Wanderings in the Far East
Among other birds in the shop at Hong Kong I noticed a cage full of
Bullfinches. These were the Eastern or Japanese Bullfinch (Pyrrhula
p. griseiventris ), a bird which differs considerably from the European
kind. It is much larger, and has the throat and cheeks a bright reddish
pink, the breast and underparts a pale grey. It is a much more attractive
broken wings and legs, and most had toes missing. I found out later
that this was due to the birds fighting, as they are extremely pugnacious,
and it is impossible to keep two birds in a cage together, even of the

opposite sex. One pair of my birds died in the North of China, but I
landed two pairs. One pair I parted with owing to the fact that even in
a large outside aviary the birds fought, and even the pair I retained
lived in such a state of animosity that the cock had to be removed to
save his life. After he was removed the hen seemed to attract all the
cock Bullfinches in the district; some of them sat all day on the roof of
the aviary, so fascinated by the hen's charms that they appeared to do
without food. As the summer wore on her attraction seemed to wane
and her suitors left, no doubt they recovered from their amorous
intoxication. These are quite the most attractive of the Bullfinches
and deserve to be better known in this country. I found them
exceedingly fond of sweet apple.
In the shop were many Finches of Chinese origin including a very
large and brightly coloured species of the Redpoll, Chinese Greenfinches
and Siskins, Bramblings and Zosterops, many of the very large Black-
headed Hawfinches, Mandarin Ducks, Painted Quail, etc. There were
several exotics, including a specimen of the very rare Blue-eyed Cockatoo
(Kakatoe ophthalmica) , which was priced at the moderate sum of 24s. ;
there were also Australians, including Sydney Waxbills, Zebra
Finches, etc.
When I asked about live food I was shown little twigs about an
inch long, priced at Id. a hundred, each of which contained a wood
grub, locally known as willow-grubs. These were greatly relished by the
Ruby-throats. What infinite patience must be needed to gather these
grubs ! It would take the average person a week to collect fifty.
In the two other shops were the inevitable Liothrix, Java Sparrows,
a few Zosterops, many Brown Laughing Thrushes or Hwamei, which
are supposed to be very fine songsters, and one poor miserable Chinese
Blue Pie ( TJrocissa erythrorhyncha) in such poor condition as to be almost
unrecognizable. There were also a quantity of Tree Sparrows and
numbers of African Green Singing Finches, which appeared very
popular song birds with the Chinese, for I saw many in cages hanging
outside houses and shops. The few shops in Hong Kong were dark and
evil-smelling places, and the birds were kept under very bad conditions,
in spite of the fact that in nearly all the shops were exquisitely made
cages with very fine china and ivory fittings.

Sydney Porter--Wanderings in the Far East
The bird market, or, at least, the market where birds were sold for
" chow ", I shall remember to my dying day. Of all the nauseating
cruelty, filth, and wretchedness I have never seen the like. Bundles of
Wild Duck, from tiny Baikal Teal to Chinese Yellow Bills, tied by the
legs to the end of a bamboo pole, being dipped alive in huge cauldrons
of boiling water in order that their feathers would come off the easier ;
men ankle deep in blood and writhing bodies of dying birds--I never
saw the like and hope never to again. On this Calvary of feathered
creatures it is better not to dwell, sufficient to say that though I am
not squeamish I couldn't relish my food for days afterwards. Amongst
the wretched motley I saw a great many Bamboo Partridges, Chinese
Francolins, Japanese and Painted Quail, many Duck including the
lovely little Baikal Teal, Chinese Yellow-bills, Mandarins, Summer Teal,
and many others ; there were even Herons and snow-white Egrets.
We inquired about Pheasants, and at one stall we thought we had
found something when the proprietor said that he had some Pheasants,
but Our hopes sank when he returned with a bunch of " Ringnecks ",
so " high " that we were even able to smell them above the general
odoriferousness of the market. When we examined them millions of tiny
flies poured out of their plumage !
Round about Hong Kong, especially on the wooded slopes of the
Peak, one sees quite a few of the commoner birds, the most conspicuous
being old favourites of mine, the Chinese White-naped Bulbuls. I
have frequently kept these birds in years past and found them one of the
most delightful of cage birds. Here they were very familiar, haunting
the environs of gardens, feeding on the various fruits and berries, and
searching clusters of leaves for insects. Another common bird is the
Red-vented Bulbul, which moves about in small bands or flocks, the
red undertail coverts being very noticeable. This bird has a fine
melodious song. Another lovely bird which I often came across was the
Durian Redstart (Phoenicurus auroreus), the most beautiful as well as the
most conspicuous of the Redstarts. I was surprised that none of the
bird dealers had any of these attractive creatures in their emporiums,
but cage birds are only valued by the Chinese if they sing. I saw many
small Warblers, but was unable to distinguish their species. Also many
Wagtails were to be seen on the low-lying areas by the water ; these

I think were the Pied ( Motacilla lugubris lugens), White-faced (M.
lugubris leucopsis), and Streak-eyed (M. alba ocularis). Kites were
exceedingly common, especially about the harbour, where they can be
seen flying low over the water, snatching with their claws at anything
edible floating on the surface.
In Shanghai I enjoyed for a short time the hospitality of Mr. Eustace,
a member of the Society, and it was in that city that the great joy was
vouchsafed to me of seeing for the first time birds which it was certainly
worth a trip to the Far East to see. These included the wonderful White
and Blue Crossoptilons, Chinese Monals, Temminck's Tragopans,
Darwin's, Koklas, and Elegant Pheasants. The bird which was of the
greatest interest to me was the wonderful White Crossoptilon, which
I think was C. drouyni and not C. tibetanum. This is the loveliest of the
Crossoptilons, and much smaller and lighter in build than either the
Manchurian or the Blue. It is snow white in colour, of an amazing purity,
with the wings and tail washed with grey. The tail feathers do not have
the barbs long and decomposed as in the other species. The red face
and short curly black crown feathers make a striking and pleasing,
contrast to the immaculate white body feathers.
The Chinese or L'huys Monal (Lophophorus Ihuysii) which I saw are
probably the only ones in captivity at the moment. This bird is
strikingly larger than the Indian Monal, especially the female, which
appears to be nearly twice as large as the female of the commoner kind ;
she is also very much more distinctly marked. The cock, although a
magnificent bird, lacks the grace and dignified carriage of its smaller
relative. The general gait gives the impression that the bird plods along
in rather a laboured and clumsy manner. The colour scheme resembles
in the main part that of the Indian species, but it differs in several
remarkable ways. It lacks the upstanding and Peacock-like crest,
but possesses a full bronze-coloured crest which falls over the nape and
at a few yards distance is almost indiscernible. The patch of white on
the rump is much more extensive than in the other species ; this white
patch is also present in the female. The tail is longer than in impeyanus
and of a bottle-green colour, the feathers having a row of white spots
near the base.
Temminck's Tragopan was many years ago a well-known species

Sydney Porter--Wanderings in the Far East
and perhaps the most beautiful of a very beautiful family. I was pleased
to see that these fine birds have now reappeared after being absent
from the market for so many years.
There was also a goodly crowd of Blue Crossoptilon. These were
wild-caught birds and not bred by the Chinese. They differed
in no way from four birds which were very kindly presented to me by
M. Delacour ; in fact, these birds seemed almost a clearer blue than the
wild ones. The wild birds differed in being slightly smaller and in having
the long flowing barbs of the central tail feathers shorter than those
of the domesticated ones.
Then there were the Koklass Pheasants, small, dapper, and
beautifully marked birds. These may have been Pucrasia xanthos&apos;pila,
but I could not be quite sure of the species.
There were many specimens of a very dark ringless type of Pheasant
(Phasianus), which may have been the Elegant Pheasant. This bird
looked almost as dark as a Versicolor.
I was fortunate in being able to spend an afternoon with the person
who had collected these Pheasants, and I heard much about the wild
life of them. In the hope that this second-hand information will throw
a little light on the lives of these rare and little known birds, I set it
down here for what it is worth. I made careful notes at the time, so
am not trusting to memory.
Many misstatements have been made about the status of the various
rare Pheasants, authors merely repeating these erroneous statements
without ever troubling to verify them. It is amazing how, when some
so-called authority makes a misstatement, such as the case of the Argus
Pheasant pushing its head through its wing-feathers during display
to peep at the hen, that this should have been repeated ad lib by almost
every proceeding author, including even Beebe, the greatest authority
on Pheasants, without even being questioned or verified.
In the first place, the homes of these Pheasants are on the great
mountain ranges of Western Szechuan, one of the most remote of Chinese
provinces. It is situated where the great mountain ranges of India,
Burma, Tibet, and Yunnan meet in the very heart of Asia. In many
cases the ranges tower over 20,000 feet. The country is of great fertility,
the valleys being very densely populated ; in fact, the population of

<bodyText confidence="0.997301583333333" page_id="56321843"  page_num="41" year="" vol="">
Szechuan is estimated at sixty millions, but the population does not
reach up to where the Pheasants make their homes. The mountains
are covered with dense vegetation as far as the snow-line, principally
with rhododendron. None of the Pheasants live together in the same
territory, but in areas quite remote from each other. In no case,
declared my informant, are the Pheasants very rare, but simply wild and
very elusive. They are not in any way persecuted by the natives, as
they have not yet been contaminated by European influence, the only
exception being the Chinese Impeyan, but even in this case it is not to
any great extent. There is a local trade in the dried bodies of this bird,
but it is not enough to affect seriously the status of the species. These
dried bodies, which are used for eating, weigh roughly about 5J lb.,
the live birds turning the scale at 8 lb. and more. The climate of these
regions is mild in the valleys but cold as one gets higher up the
mountains. In the summer the birds move high up the mountains to
about 12,000 feet to near the limit of vegetation ; in the winter they
move down to about 7,000 to 8,000 feet. This Pheasant (the Chinese
Impeyan) is known to the natives as the " Fire-charcoal bird ", not
as I thought on account of its glowing ember and black plumage, but
owing to the fact that when the natives fire a certain area so that they
can plant fresh gardens the birds come down after the fire and eat the
charcoal. For food these Impeyans live to a great extent on a certain
white berry, which is also eaten by the Chinese of the district. The
birds also eat roots and insects. When once caught the bird is hardy
and peaceful, and is not given to fighting. Eight birds in all were
secured.
The White Crossoptilon lives even higher up than the Impeyan,
almost right up to the snow-line, but it does not live amongst the snow,
as its glistening white plumage would seem to indicate. It is not
uncommon but excessively wary and difficult to obtain. The greatest
difficulty in procuring any of these Pheasants is the utter
inaccessibility of their haunts. Some of the places where these birds
were collected were 2,200 miles inland from the coast. The Chinese are
hostile to all foreigners, and the officials place every difficulty in the
way. After journeying right through China to the home of the Pheasants
over 2,000 miles from Shanghai, the collector was called back by the

authorities because they thought that his passport might not be in
order ! When they saw it was, they told him he might retrace his foot-
steps ! This journey takes months and costs a great deal of money.
Marauding bands of soldiers overrun the country killing, burning, and
looting ; in fact, in these districts one carries one's life in his hands.
A base camp where the collector had, after a long period of trapping,
managed to collect a hundred White Crossoptilons, was raided by a
marauding army, many of the natives of the village were killed, the
huts burnt, all the Pheasants were killed and eaten, and had the
collector been there he would doubtless have been killed as well.
The birds are carried for many weeks in baskets by coolies over
hundreds of miles of wild country, until they reach the Yangtze-kiang,
and they then start a journey of a thousand miles or more by boat
down the river to the coast.
The cost of these expeditions, which can only be undertaken at a
great personal risk, is very heavy. And with the increasing political
strife in China the position will, in the course of time, become more and
more difficult. Even when one has made oneself secure with the local
war lord or general there is soon a rival upstart to propitiate.
The White Crossoptilons fight very badly and so must travel and
be housed separately, otherwise they kill and maim each other. Their
habitat is the rolling grasslands below the snow-line on the edge of the
higher forests at about 14,000 feet, but the birds move lower down in
the winter. They are in no way persecuted by the natives, even though
the birds occasionally make inroads into the natives' grain fields when
they come down to the lower regions. Only four of these birds reached
Shanghai. These I saw. Of the Blue Crossoptilon I was told that of all
the Pheasants this is the wildest and wariest and its haunts the most
inaccessible to reach ; yet, strange to say, when domesticated it is
the tamest and most companionable. It roosts high up in the trees,
and upon the slightest disturbance it will hurtle itself into the air and
dash away with the most terrific speed. Owing to the value placed on
the beautiful decomposed silky central tail feathers, and also the broad
outer tail feathers which were used for stiffening purposes in the
clothes of the Chinese, the birds were extensively domesticated by the
natives in Western Szechuan. My informant stated that he had seen

a flock following a Chinese farmer about as he worked in the fields,
more after the manner of hounds than birds, and if a bird found an
edible root it would stop, quickly dig it up with its stout beak and eat
it, and then rash off at full speed to catch the farmer up.
Now that the export of the feathers to America and Europe is
prohibited, and they are not used as formerly for the decoration of the
hats of the Mandarins or the stiffening purposes in cloth through a
\0x25A0substitute having been found, the birds are not as extensively
domesticated as formerly. There were a fine lot of these birds in
Shanghai, and I secured only one female as I had an odd cock at home.
This bird was a great favourite. We called her " Emma ", and though
.a wild-caught bird she was perfectly tame. I had her on board for a
long time, but unfortunately the heat in Johore, where I stayed for
.a time, seemed to affect her, and though she was given her liberty she
went into a decline and died. She hated fowls and spent her time during
the day in chasing them. Even at night she took possession of the fowl-
house and refused to let a fowl enter.
Were the virtues of the Crossoptilons better known to aviculturists
I am sure these delightful birds would be more widely kept. No
Pheasants suffer more from being kept in a confined space, yet none
afford greater pleasure to their owner when kept at liberty. Incarcerated
in a small pen, the birds soon get to look very bedraggled and lose the
bloom which one sees in liberty birds. They also seem to bite off, out
of sheer boredom, the long flowing tail plumes which constitute their
*chief glory. In fact, in close captivity one never sees them in their full
beauty--their bright red legs washed in dew on the grass, the glint of
the sun on their iridescent tail feathers, or the pure white of the striking
\0x25A0elongated ear coverts, which are the characteristic feature of this group
of birds. In a pen or aviary these ear plumes appear grey or a dirty
white, which gives the impression that the bird is not in good health.
At liberty these birds are far tamer and more intelligent than a
*domestic fowl, and they never seem to wander away. They delight in
human companionship, though they hate to be touched or handled,
which, in any case, is a mistake, for their feathers are held very loosely
in the skin and soon come out.
When a human appears on the scene they will inevitably saunter

up in a casual kind of way, and if one squats down and becomes friendly
with the birds they will start to talk to one in the low murmuring under-
tones with which Beebe says they talk to each other when searching
for food on the rolling uplands of Eastern Tibet and China.
My little nieces say the birds look as though they had their heads
bandaged up, but somehow they remind me in a remote way of a very
red-faced colonel with a huge white moustache. Be that as it may, I
am sure aviculturists would go a long way before they found a more
delightful bird. They are easy to breed and the bird always commands
a good price on the market.
One of my birds, in keeping with a Specifer Peafowl, has a great
passion for motor-cars, which she will examine by the hour, going round
and round and looking at every part, being particularly interested in the
plated hub-caps in which she sees her reflection.
The Temminck's Tragopan, one of the most beautiful of Pheasants,
is found in the lower ranges of the mountains of Western Szechuan,
and is more aboreal in its habits than any of the others mentioned. It
is not found higher than about 8,000 feet. The birds are difficult to
keep, and the collector thought that they die of shock when first caught,
as only a few seem to survive the first few weeks after being caught.
These birds and, in fact, all the Pheasants in this region are caught in
spring nooses, and with this species the shock is no doubt often fatal.
They are extremely difficult to observe in a state of nature, and
on the slightest sign of danger they disappear like a flash into the
impenetrable undergrowth. They are not rare in their native habitat-
arid appear to feed to a large extent on insects.
The Blood Pheasants ( Ithagenes ) are the most difficult to keep in
captivity, and very few indeed ever survive the long journey to the
coast. The collector told me that they are the most difficult of all
Pheasants to keep alive after being caught; also they are extremely
pugnacious and will fight to the death ; on this account they can never
be kept together, not even hen and cock, each bird having to be caged
separately. These birds are found higher up than any other Pheasants,
right on the very snow-line, where the weather is very severe. I doubt
if they could ever stand the hot journey through the tropics to this
country.

The Koklass (Pucrasia), a bird not well known to Pheasant keepers
in Europe, is, I understand, very plentiful in its native habitat, and is
the most insectivorous of all the Pheasants. The plumage of these birds,
&apos;though not brilliant, is a very pleasing mixture of many shades of
blacks, browns, and greys. It is a dapper little bird, and I thought
very desirable from an aviculturist's point of view.
The Elegant Pheasants live right down in the valleys and are very
common everywhere. They remind one very much of a hybrid between
P. colchicus and P. versicolor. They are very dark in colour.
There appears to be a great difficulty in getting any live Pheasants
out of China, officially of course, for although millions of frozen
Pheasants are sent to the American and European markets, live ones
are forbidden to be exported, though with the aid of a few dollars this
difficulty is easily overcome.
There is little chance that any more of these Pheasants mentioned
will be exported from China, unless a special expedition is financed by
aviculturists, as none of these birds appear to be caught or handled by
the Chinese themselves, and only a man of indomitable courage and
with unlimited financial backing will face the risks and dangers of such
an expedition. Even if one does obtain the birds one is never sure that
they will ever reach the coast.

t During the past year I have experimented with various types of
pens for my small collection of foreign Doves. Owing to the fact that
cats troubled the doves considerably in the night by running back and
forth on the wire-netting covering the top--cats which I could not very
well destroy since they belonged to my neighbours--I decided to cover the
various aviary-pens with solid board roofs. Fellow Dove fanciers tried
to dissuade me from doing this on the ground that the individual pens
would be much too dark and gloomy and would, therefore, be unsuitable

for breeding and rearing Doves and Pigeons which presumably want
plentiful light and as much sunshine as possible. However, I am glad to
be able to report that such varieties as Bronzewings, Cape, Australian
Crested, Blue Ground, and Diamond Doves have without exception done
very well in the covered aviaries. As a matter of fact, even in these
already slightly dark places, they seek out the darkest corners in which
to nest and rear their youngsters, proving that foreign doves thrive in
the semi-dark seclusion of a covered aviary. I should add that the
pens face south and that their fronts get a good deal of sunshine during
the day, and there are comparatively few days in the year when we do
not get at least some sunshine in Southern California.
I have also had good success in breeding foreign Doves in an aviary
with the usual top of wire-netting, which aviary is planted with some
trees and much shrubbery. Bleeding-heart Doves seek the seclusion
which evergreen plants afford them the year round. Diamond Doves
prefer the fragile branches of a young cherry tree, which grows in the
aviary, to the customary nest-box. It is not at all difficult to keep the
trees and shrubs clean, since the entire aviary is thoroughly sprinkled
and watered once a week, at which time all the plants in it are washed
clean and fresh. At such times the Brush Bronze-wing and the Galapagos
Doves squat on the ground and spread one wing at a time to be sprinkled
with water. It is their way of taking the weekly bath ; I have never yet
seen them bathe in the special pan which is always available to them.
It requires considerable effort and patience to learn which varieties
of Doves are most likely to be suitable aviary companions for other
varieties. Of course, the ideal way to keep doves is perhaps to have a
separate pen for each pair, but lack of space forbids such an arrangement
so far as I am concerned. Perhaps the strangest combination which
I have in one pen consists of a pair of very prolific Australian Crested
Doves, a Venezuela Mocking Bird and a Troupial, all of which share
the branches of an orange tree for nesting and roosting purposes--a
small tree. These three different occupants get on famously with one
another. At first the " Mocker " was inclined to boss the others, but
it became soon apparent that the Crested Doves would stand no
nonsense from that quarter. The Doves and two birds have now been
together for more than six months and are completely reconciled to

one another's habits and company so that there are no clashes
whatever.
It is interesting to note that some varieties of Doves breed in this
climate the whole year through. Thus, the Bronze-wings are not at all
bothered by cold nights--we have frosts here occasionally in December,
January, and February, when the water-dishes are covered with ice---
nor are the Diamond Doves. They will continue to breed month after
month, stopping occasionally in the early fall to take a few week's
deserved rest. It is not easy to say whether these breeding conditions
are likely to endanger and weaken their health and shorten their life's
breeding period. It seems clear, however, that they are not breeding too
rapidly, since these two varieties raise their youngsters carefully to
maturity each time before laying subsequent clutches of eggs. The Cape
Doves seem to be somewhat more sensitive to climatic changes, for they
stop breeding activities promptly with the advent of cold nights in
November and will usually not resume them until springtime, when the
nights get warmer. I have been told that they are uninteresting and
sluggish little fellows, but that is certainly not true of my pair of Cape
Doves, which is very active and very lively day in and day out. To be
sure, this pair has consistently refused to rear its young thus far---for
a whole year--which, however, is not such a serious deficiency since
I have several pairs of trusty Diamond Doves which rear the young
Cape Doves splendidly, feeding them until they are fully capable of
feeding themselves.
A noteworthy characteristic of some foreign Doves is that though
they hatch two youngsters regularly, they will always rear but one,,
letting the other die after three or four days. This has been the case
invariably with my Indian G-reenwing Doves--splendid, though shy,
parents which have reared youngster after youngster for me for several
seasons past. Never yet have these doves failed to rear at least one.
Their only fault lies in their extreme shyness, which often results in
their throwing eggs and even youngsters out of their flimsily built nests.
This past season has been one of the most successful so far in my
experience with foreign Doves. All varieties have reared young, except
the Blue-spotted Doves. They have laid half a dozen settings of eggs,
only to desert them each time after but a few days' incubation. They

are extremely graceful birds, especially in flight, which is swift and sure,
and their pleasing, penetrating call may be heard far away. Which
reminds me that very few varieties of my Doves coo in the night,
probably so as not to disclose their location to prowling enemies. I have,
however, heard the Mourning Dove and the Bronze-wing call in the dead
of night. In its native habitat the male Mourning Dove will during the
breeding season roost at some distance from the nest, so that if his cooing
in the night should perchance attract an enemy he would not be likely
to find the Dove's nest which is usually located in another tree.
Of the varieties of Doves I have kept, thus far, the Galapagos are the
most difficult to rear, since the old will so very frequently desert their
young. Moreover, this Dove is extremely pugnacious, fighting off Doves
twice its size, and must, therefore, be usually kept alone. But even within
the narrow circle of its own family, the Galapagos has a trying time to
keep peace, since the male and female are at odds most of the time during
the breeding season. And yet I like the Galapagos Dove very much, for
it is quickly tamed with various titbits, such as hemp, bread, and
mealworms. The Galapagos Dove is not as common in this country as it
used to be, owing, no doubt, to the difficulties in breeding which I have
just mentioned.
My next task will be to study the family life of my Doves photo-
graphically with a view to obtaining some really interesting pictures.
This requires great patience, a virtue with which many of us Americans
are not over-much blessed. I hope in due time to obtain a few of the rarer
varieties of Doves and to observe them closely. My aim is to keep only
a limited number of Doves in order to give them the attention they merit.
Just recently I was fortunate in obtaining a pair of White-fronted
Amethyst Doves and there is an opportunity to get some Black-fronted
as well. It will be very much worth while to get an insight into their
breeding habits and their family life in general. In due time I hope to be
able to report on both varieties. The longer I keep foreign Doves, the
more fascinating I find them to be. It is a sort of circle into which this
hobby has thrown me, but assuredly not a vicious circle ; rather one
getting fuller and more meaningful and interesting with the swift
passing of time.

It has been suggested that monthly notes written on matters of
general interest about the birds to be seen at the Zoo would be welcomed
by many who live too far away to pay a personal visit, and I propose
to open the series by giving my impression of the various Birds of
Paradise now housed at the Zoo.
These are, perhaps, the most glamorous birds in existence, and
make a great appeal to the imagination. They are very beautiful,
all have a wonderful display, and even to-day very little is known of
their wild life. In giving any description of the Zoo collection, pride of
place must be given to the Lesser Bird of Paradise, Paradisic/, minor,
from North-West New Guinea and Mysol Island; this bird has been
in the collection for at least six years, and at this time of the year is
in glorious plumage, and frequently displays ; the plumes are yellow,
becoming white at the tips. Near by is Paradisia apoda, from the
Aru Islands, the Greater Bird of Paradise, with exceptionally long
plumes of beautiful golden yellow, shading to pale chocolate at the
extremities. In another large aviary we find the Empress Augusta
Victoria's Bird of Paradise, Paradisia augusta victoria, from the
Rawlinson Mountains, North-East New Guinea---in colour something
between minor and raggiana. And from the same locality there is the
Emperor of Germany's Bird of Paradise, Paradisia gulielmi.
Then we come to two beauties, Count Raggi's Bird of Paradise,
Paradisia raggiana, which occurs in South and South-East New Guinea,
and has the most beautiful brilliant crimson plumes, and Paradisia
dicora, the Grey-breasted Bird of Paradise, from far Ferguson Island.
This is the most beautiful and interesting of recent importations.
Mr. Shaw Meyer, the first to bring it alive to 'this country, obtained it
after suffering many tribulations, privations, and exciting adventures.
Ferguson Island, owing to being a cannibal island, was, until recently,
not considered safe to a white man. When this Bird of Paradise arrived
this spring it fairly took our breath away ; the plumes are the most
vivid red, the head and shoulders are rich straw yellow, and the breast
is a beautiful mauvy grey.

N. Wharton-Tigar--Notes from the London Zoo
Now we move to the other side of the small Bird House, and in
large square cages we find a perfect specimen of the Lesser Superb
Bird of Paradise, Lophorhina superba minor, which inhabits the Owen
Stanley and Charles Louis Mountains in South New Guinea. This
gem can usually be seen displaying about five o'clock in the afternoon.
Nearby is the young and not yet full plumed Prince Rudolph's
Bird of Paradise, Paradisornis rudolfi, also known as the Blue Bird
of Paradise, a friendly bird this, ever ready to welcome you, and give
you, for as long as you care to stay and admire, his unique display
upside down. An absolutely perfect specimen of this species occupies
a large aviary cage on this same side. Close by is an immature specimen
of Wallace's Bird of Paradise, Semioptera wallacei, from Molluccas,.
gowned in beige and vivid green. Farther on is the Magnificent Bird
of Paradise, Diphyllodes magnified magnified, North-West New Guinea--
one of the very small varieties, and which has a wonderful display.
At the far end in one of the large aviaries housing a mixed collection
is to be found a very fine example of the Red Bird of Paradise, Uranoris
rubra, from the islands of Waigiou, Batanta, and Gemien, belonging to
quite another family, and yet in many respects like P. raggiana. It
has two curious rises on the head, the wires are extraordinary, and the
plumes fall differently from the Paradisea group. This species has come
nearer than any other to breeding in captivity, the world famous
Mr. Whitley, of Primley Zoo, having nearly bred them on two occasions.
In one of the middle aviaries there is a New Guinea Rifle Bird,
Ptilorhis magnifica, and in the Tropical House we find a fine six-plumed
Bird of Paradise, Parotia lawesi, South-East New Guinea--one of the
most delightful birds to possess, usually tame and with a most amusing
display.
Finally we come to a very fine pair of Mayer's Sickle-billed Bird of
Paradise from South-East New Guinea. The male of this species has
tail feathers several feet in length : both have a long, curved bill shaped
like a sickle. When I saw these birds on Boxing Day they were sitting
close together and were certainly on very good terms. Let us hope that
a sensational event may occur, and the Zoo have the honour to be the
first to breed Birds of Paradise in captivity.

The Avicultural Society of New Zealand has sent us their seventh
Annual Report which contains so much of interest to all aviculturists
that I have made copious selections from it.
The following have been successfully bred : The Blue-faced Parrot
Finch (Chloromunia trichoa), by Mr. George Reid, who notes as follows :
" They built the usual type of finch nest in a ti-tree at the extreme
end of their shelter, but from the time they went to nest until the
young appeared I never went near the nest, nor did I hear any sounds
of life from within. On 19th April one young appeared, and on the
following day three more. They were extremely active and well
matured and within two days were picking over the seed pots and
flying about as strongly as their parents.
" The young have luminous nodules on the beak--their green bodies
and carmine tails are like the old birds but the blue face is hardly
discernible. The upper mandibles are black as in the adult bird,
the lower ones were bright orange, but they soon lost their lustre and
gradually darkened. The old birds were given soaked millet spray
daily and green food as available, though owing to the drought seeding
grasses did not exist. They had access to insect food: it is doubtful
whether they availed themselves of it."
The same gentleman also bred the Orange-breasted Waxbill
(Sporwginthus subflavus). Five eggs produced two young which were
reared on insects obtained from blighted cabbages, fresh cut turf;
and the small shellfish and creatures contained in fresh-cut watercress.
Again Mr. Reid is to the fore with young Gouldians, concerning
some of which he relates a curious story. He had in his aviary a Chestnut-
breasted Finch paired with a hen Black-headed Nun, which had made
several attempts to breed but the eggs were always infertile. At la&amp;t
he saw them feeding young and hoped for some very unusual hybrids,
but to his astonishment three young Gouldians flew from the nest.
The Finch and the Nun fed their foster children most assiduoiisly,
and Mr. Reid particularly noticed that whereas young Gouldians with
their own parents are continually calling for food, those reared by -the

Finch and the Nun rarely raised their voices at all which he takes to
mean that the food supplied by the latter was more satisfying.
Mr. Reid applied for a breeding certificate for successfully rearing
St. Helena Waxbills and Mr. Bullock for breeding Double Bar Finches.
Mrs. Gr. Collins' Stanley Parrakeets procured from the Avicultural
Society went to nest, laid five eggs, and reared five healthy youngsters.
Incubation lasted twenty-three days and the first young bird left the
nest a month after the first egg was laid, fully fledged and scarcely
distinguishable from the old hen. The eggs were laid on alternate days.
The usual parrot mixture was given supplemented by millet sprays
and seeding grasses.
Mr. Howlett bred the Black-headed Nun.
The Hon. Secretary reports that the membership is " in a healthy
condition owing to the increased interest taken in aviculture We
can only hope that this satisfactory state of affairs will continue and
that we shall hear of still more breeding successes when the next Bulletin
is issued.

A fascinating adjutant to the bird-fancier's hobby is the study
of wild birds. It is a subject which amply repays the watcher for
his patient hours. Birds, as every fancier knows, unlike many other
things, can never be dull or uninteresting ; there are always some
new peculiarities and habits to be noted.
Most people when starting bird watching, first procure a reliable
bird book, and before setting out to watch and study the birds them-
selves, they proceed to con the main gist of the book off by heart.
A more novel form of bird book is that which you write yourself.
Buy a large blank book and fill it with your observations. By this
method you write your own book which is surely more interesting
and more accurate (in regard to your observations). You need not

totally discard the textbook, for it will prove invaluable for verification
and for identifying unknown species.
To fill up this book set out for a suitable wild bird haunt complete
with pencil and pad (your " book " having been left at home to be
filled in more carefully from hurried jottings), and where possible a
camera. Having chosen a good position, well hidden, sit and wait.
Patience is the greatest virtue at this point. If you are lucky the
birds will not notice you or will soon become used to your presence,
and will behave in their natural manner. You must surely be delighted
by the ever-interesting incidents of bird life--now you are almost
startled out of your wits by the ringing laugh of the Green Woodpecker ;
now you are amused by the screams of a Jay as it is mobbed by a
flock of smaller birds ; but do not stare wonderstruck all the time,
your pencil must be busy jotting down what you see. This can be
entered into your bird book at home in your leisure, under suitable
headings.
The best way is to take a bird, write down its appearance, as it
strikes you, and the points by which it can most easily be recognized
and distinguished. After this make a list of its habits (as you have
observed them), nesting, eggs, flight, manners, peculiarities, etc. Below
this make a note of any little incidents in which you have seen the
bird in question involved. Leave a blank space for further additions,
for you will certainly have some if not many. The opposite pages
could be filled with appropriate photographs, if you have been fortunate
enough to procure any, or drawings if you have a flair for that sort
of thing.
This book will not be finished in a week, or even a month. It will
take years of careful watching and study, but it will be well worth it.
The completed work will be a dear treasure, for not only will it
be a mine of useful information, but it will have been written by your-
self, and will contain a complete history of your study of wild birds.

Illustrations by the Author
In my time I have owned many very tame and charming pet birds
of various species, but the one I loved best of all was a Barn Owl.
It came into my possession while quite young, about nine days old,
and was reared with great care. As I took very great care of it, it
became unusually tame and affectionate. At first, before it could
fly, it used to run after me and later on it would fly after me all through
the house. It would come when called, and its favourite perch was
on my shoulder, and I could pick it up at any time and scratch its
head as if it were a Parrot, while in return it would nibble my hair.
It was civil to my wife on the whole, but by no means as amiable
as it was with me, and once it got angry and bit her, so that she was
not very fond of it, and there was always a certain mistrust on both
sides. The Owl hated strangers ; if it was in its cage, as was usually
the case in the day time, as soon as it saw a visitor it assumed the
threatening attitude with spread wings and ruffled plumage, moved its
sunk head from side to side, snapping its beak, and flew at the face
of the unwelcome guest. Although the wires were between them, and
in consequence no harm could happen, this always startled the visiter
and made him draw back quickly. If the Owl was loose in the room
when a stranger came in, it would fly up to the curtain rod and perch
there quietly, as if it was not in any way concerned with the visitor.
But when he was quietly chatting and had forgotten all about the
bird, it would suddenly fly down on to his head, claw him furiously,
and return to its safe perch before the injured party rightly understood
what had taken place. But as this resulted in severe scratches, and
once nearly injured an eye, we were obliged to shut up the Owl when-
ever anyone came to see us, and for that matter people always inquired
if the Owl was at liberty, and if the answer was in the affirmative,
they would not come in. Once only did the Owl fly at my face as
I passed it wearing my dress clothes. This, however, was purely by
mistake, because it did not recognize me in this unusual costume, for

as soon as I spoke it became friendly and twittered in obvious
embarrassment.
The Owl was afraid of carp and other fishes which it often saw
swimming in a vessel in the kitchen, and was absolutely terrified if it
was shown a harmless grass snake, so much so that after an attempt
at defiance it took to flight. It feared cats and certain other birds
such as Peregrine Falcons and the large Buzzards, but would attack
them in the same way as it did human beings, neither could it endure
the sight of other Owls. It knew how to capture live Sparrows and
cockchafers in flight, but it preferred mice, though curiously enough
it often let them escape as it had the habit of watching them earnestly
while it wagged its head from side to side, sitting meanwhile on its
lofty perch on the curtain pole before it made a pounce. If this
happened at the right moment, the mouse would be seized and killed
at once. It liked to catch paper balls, and would play with these and
suchlike things like a kitten or a puppy. It was exceedingly inquisitive,
and minutely inspected anything new in the room, but if flowers were
arranged it was not satisfied until the vase lay in bits on the floor,
which did not endear it to my wife, who found great fault with this
habit. Except for this, the Owl did not do much damage, nor did it
make much mess. As soon as it was let out of its cage it went to one
particular spot and made a large evacuation. But after this it made
only a few quite small ones in the course of the evening. A Robin with
its frequent though small evacuations dirtied the room and furniture
much more.
I was very fond of this bird, and was much grieved when it died
at the age of only three years. It had eaten some of a hen which was
brought to me, and had probably been poisoned.
The other Owls which I kept never became so tame, either because
they were too old when I obtained them, or I could not find enough
time to devote to them. Adult Owls naturally never become really
tame, and even young ones require much time and patience, also
they should be alone, which cannot easily be managed with a large
collection of birds.

The curious Bleeding-heart Ground Pigeons of the Philippine Islands
are replaced in New Guinea and neighbouring islands by the smaller
brown Golden-hearts, whose breasts are tinged with deep bright yellow
instead of blood red. Like their cousins, they are forest dwellers and
they walk and live on the ground, perching only at night. Golden-hearts
have been seldom imported and have never been bred so far. A pair of
these rare birds was brought for me by Mr. Frost, the well-known
collector, and were turned out into a large aviary with a good many
other birds. They laid only one egg, which was creamy white and rather
glossy and oval in shape, and pointed at the smaller end . This egg was
noticed when nest-boxes and baskets were being removed on 16th Sep-
tember for the winter. The nest was constructed of small twigs and leaves
in a basket hung up 10 feet from the floor on the wall in the sleeping
quarters. The actual date when the egg was laid is unknown. Although
these Pigeons were always building nests, no eggs were found, and all
hopes of their breeding had been given up. On 29th September a young
one was noticed, being about two days old. It grew rapidly and when
it left the nest on 17th October it was quite strong and about two-thirds
the size of its parents. After leaving the nest the parents guarded it from
every bird or Pigeon for about ten days, by sitting close to it. After that
they took no more notice of it, and we often saw it at the seed tray where
it always picked out white millet seeds from the remainder. The colour
of the young bird is very much like its parents only slightly paler.

Amongst some of my delightful Christmas gifts I received two
gramophone records that go with a book entitled Songs of Wild Birds ,
by E. M. Nicholson and Ludwig Koch. The recording on those two
records of the songs of some of our British birds is very fine indeed,
considering how delicate some of our wee birds' voices are. The
Nightingale, Blackbird, Thrush, Robin, and Chaffinch are remarkably
clear and distinct. Anyone loving the songs of our British birds will
revel in the two records.
Yet another most fascinating record is a Decca--K. 692--priced
only 25. 6 d. and a 12 in. one. This is of that wonderful bird the
Lyre-bird, Australia's premier songster and mocking bird---a truly
marvellous record--on the one side a talk on the bird, and on the
other the song. I am almost ashamed to have to own up that I had
no idea the Lyre-bird was such a songster and mimic. If you have
never heard that wonderful bird's song and mimicry, I strongly
recommend this record and I feel sure you will not be disappointed ;
if, on the other hand, you have neither a radio-gram, nor a gramophone,
do get one--the records are worth it ! Also the last-named record is
as good as a tonic and I really think may take the place of one !
Give it a trial, sample half a crown !

siderable interest to many members of the Avicultural Society.

will be featured, and also a correspondence column has been well
patronized.
Some of our " Doctor " members discuss the relative merits of
the well-known Ornamental Pheasants. I shall be very pleased to
send a copy of this number to any member of the Aviculfcural Society
who cares to apply. This offer is not entirely disinterested, for I hope
that the happy reception of the Journal may induce many of your
members to join our Society.
Monsieur J. Delacour, our President, had fully intended to be present
at the Annual General Meeting, which will have been held before these
notes appear. Unfortunately he has been detained in America and will
not be present after all.
We are very sorry about this as he had given us to understand that
he had some helpful suggestions to put forward. Our President has
no intention of being merely a figure-head, and is most anxious that
we shall go steadily forward and accomplish all the projects which
formed the basis for the original inception of the O.P.S.
Of course M. Delacour will be able to help us as no other living
Phasianist could, and on his return from America we shall look forward
to any suggestion he may think fit to bring forward for our con-
sideration. I am rather inclined to think that he is in hopes that our
Society will be able to produce our Journal in collaboration with the
American Ornamental Society. Speaking only for myself I think this
may be a practical and excellent suggestion provided, of course, we
in no way lose any prestige, and I am sure M. Delacour will not wish
this to happen.
The Palace Show will also have taken place before this issue is
published, and we are confident that the entries in the Pheasant section
will have surprised all bird lovers. I shall hope to tell you the result
of this show in my next notes.

THE BIRD SHOPS OF SINGAPORE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99611282051282" page_id="56321865"  page_num="59" year="" vol="">
Madam, -- I have followed the correspondence on the above matter and
my sympathies are entirely with Mr. Sydney Porter. I cannot refrain from
giving some impressions I have gleaned from a great personal friend of mine
who lived in Malaya for over twenty years and spent a lot of this time in
Singapore. He is a bird lover and he has told me that the mere sight of the
bird shops in Singapore made him feel physically sick, surely strong con-
demnation ? The information that I have gathered from him is that most of
the birds, including Pheasants, are fed mainly on rice of very poor quality
and that many birds die weekly from sheer starvation. He has told me that
he has frequently taken suitable food into these bird shops and surreptitiously
fed the poor birds, particularly the soft-billed varieties. This food has
invariably been eaten ravenously by the wretched occupants. He once
expostulated with the proprietor of a bird shop and was told iu solemn tones,
that he could only afford to supply rice and this in limited quantities. My
friend told me he gave up taking food into the shops because the sight of the
ravenous birds literally brought tears to his eyes and one can readily believe
this. The rice is thrown into the cages regardless of filth and receptacles
rarely are provided: one can well imagine the appalling results. To put the
matter in a nutshell, my friend asserts that these poor creatures die from
slow starvation unless kind friends rescue them from the clutches of these :
cruel but not ignorant people.
As to Pheasant trapping, here I am able to quote from our great authority
Monsieur J. Delacour. I am sure that if he was in Europe at the present
time he would write on this subject, but I am in a position to quote from
an article he has written for the O.P.S. Journal which will be published
before this letter appears. In this article M. Delacour states that practically
all Pheasants are trapped in the same manner, viz.: " The immense majority
of Pheasants are trapped in nooses, when they are caught by the neck, which
often happens if the nooses are baited or, if a leg is damaged, it is better to
make skins of them or to utilize them for the pot, etc.; many, however, are
caught alive." M. Delacour then explains the method of trapping which
corresponds in every detail with Mr. Porter's letter. I think it is a recognized
fact that trapping of Pheasants leaves much to be desired and in proof of
this I must recommend Mr. Frost to read the article referred to in the
O.P.S. Journal. If there is one authority on whom absolute reliance can be
placed it is surely the opinion of Monsieur Delacour. I t hink it is quite
probable that many members of the Avicultural Society would like to read
the article by Monsieur Delacour. A post card to Miss J. M. Grant-Ives,
Wellesbourne, Warwick, will secure a copy.

here, in captivity, in 1899. I long thought that I was the first person to do
this, but it is recorded in " The Daily Occurrences Book [MS.] of the Zoological
Society of London ,5 that in 1839 seven black game were purchased and that
on " 17th June, 1840, four black game hatched of which three died on 9tli,
10th, and 20th July ; the other on 6th January, 1841 These records are
interesting if only because they show that black game breed in their first

These beautiful Magpies, with the rest of the genus Urocissa , are
found in the mountains of Northern India, Burma, China, and Indo-
China, but the largest and finest species comes from Formosa. All the
continental forms have brown eyes and white under parts, whereas
the Formosan Blue Magpie has pale yellow irides and a blue belly,
which add greatly to its beauty. Perhaps, however, its tail is not
quite as long nor as gracefully curved and waving as that of its smaller
relations.
Like all the Urocissa , the Formosan Blue Magpies live in woods and
in open country, well provided with trees and bushes. They go in small
parties, hunting for large insects, small vertebrates, and fruit, and
are numerous in the camphor forests on the mountains. They are
shy and difficult to approach. Only a few specimens have from time
to time been imported alive into Japan, but none had reached England
until Mr. Ezra received a pair as a gift from Prince Taka-Tsukasa, and
it is from one of them that this illustration was made. Readers of the
Avicultural Magazine will remember that Mr. Ezra wrote a descrip-
tion of his birds in the October number of 1935, from which this note
has been taken.

This month I propose writing about the Humming Birds at the Zoo.
Hummers are of all birds the most romantic, often so small and yet
so beautiful. Waterton is quoted in Gould's Monograph of the Humming
Birds , as saying : " Though least in size the glittering mantle of the
Humming Bird entitles it to the first place in the birds of the New
World."
For many years it was impossible to keep them fit for any length
of time, at the Zoo, and we owe it to the enterprise and determination
of Mr. Seth-Smith that a way was at last found.
The majority of the collection are housed in the well-known Tropical
House, where they lead a happy life with plenty of room for flight,
surrounded by beautiful vegetation, often exotic orchids, and other
lovely flowers, a warm well-ventilated atmosphere, with frequent
spraying which keeps the house at the right moisture ; fountains on
pedestals are provided, and play constantly with gentle spray over the
shallow pools, in which the birds dart in and out, enjoying life to the
full. Tiny banana flies are specially bred and liberated there, to
provide the live food so relished by many species. Their own special
diet of " nectar " in small glass bottles with protruding lips is hung up
and in front of them the Hummers hover and feed.
The collection is rather low at the present time, comprising only
six species ; in many cases several specimens of each variety ; all
are in beautiful condition. The oldest inhabitant, a White-throated
Sapphire Hylocharis cyanea, has been in the collection since November,
1933. This variety comes from Eastern Brazil, and as a cage and aviary
bird is well known to many of us. Though very small they are hardy
and tame, and have, like most Hummers, a delightful little song. The
head, throat, and breast are rich deep blue, and they have a few white
feathers on the chin, hence the name ; upper surface and wing coverts,
green, passing into reddish bronze on upper tail coverts ; wings purplish
brown, tail bluish black, under surface green, bill fleshy red deepening
into black at the tips. From the same locality the Zoo has specimens.

of the White-bellied Emerald (. Agyrtria leucogaster). There are two out-
standing varieties from Martinique, French West Indies, the Gilt Crested
Humming Bird ( Ornithorhynchus exilis), a beautiful fairy-like little
creature, 3 |inches in length, with a metallic golden-green crest deepen-
ing in hue at the base ; and from the same island and also found in
Nevis comes the Garnet-throated Humming Bird (Eulampis jugularis );
the colour of the throat when the light shines on it is too lovely, a
wonderful vinous purple ; head, upper surface of body, flank?, and
abdomen velvety black, tail very dark green ; the coloration of the
bird is superb ; but it is of a heavy type, and not as attractive in
flight or as gay in its movements as many other Hummers.
The Zoo also have Fraser's Humming Bird ( Threnestes fraseri).
I was unable to find this bird, so cannot describe it.
And last but not least, in the large central aviary in the Small
Bird House, with specimens of many and varied kinds of birds, both
large and small, we find the Swallow-tailed Humming Bird (Eupetomenia
macroura). In a good light this is a gorgeous bird, prevailing colour
peacock blue, with long swallowlike tail. They are as hard as nails,
and have been known to winter out of doors in this country. This
variety is found throughout Brazil. Owing to restrictions being placed
on catching birds by the Brazilian Government, the supply is likely
to be almost cut off from this source, which gave the Zoo many very
lovely examples in the past, such as the little Racquet-tailed (Discosura
longicauda), a star turn for a long time ; Heliomaster mesoleucus
squamosus, a variety with a very long beak and large luminous ruby
patch on throat. This species had a long life in the collection ; then
the well-known and plentiful Chrysolampis moschitus , one of the loveliest
of Hummers, Waterton's Wood Nymph ( Thalurania watertoni),
Heliotrise auriculata, Lophornis magnificus, and two Wood Hermits
(Phsethornis superciliosa and P. pygmasa), varieties that so far have
not thriven in captivity ; but the last named lived for a time in a
special cage, and was a very great attraction to visitors on account
of its minute size.
We shad look forward in the future to the arrival of many species
not yet seen alive in this country from other parts of the New
World.

{Continued from p. 45)
To the stranger in China, the native markets and shops are a
never ending source of interest, the native city in Shanghai being no
exception, and its numerous bird shops provide a veritable Eldorado
for the aviculturist. These bird shops, though situated in the native
quarter, are by no means all together. They are native fashion with
open fronts and the birds hung outside, the only exception being the
shop of Mr. Woo which has a glass front in more or less the European
style. The birds in the bazaars, while not by any means kept under
hygienic conditions and leaving much to be desired in the way of
accommodation, were kept in a much better state than most I saw
afterwards.
Practically all the birds were caged separately, often in incredibly
small cages, Avadavats and Pekin Kobins being the exception, the
latter being crowded by hundreds into very inadequate cages, though
the birds appeared to be in good condition. After the Brown Laughing
Thrush ( Trochalpterum canorum ), which are to be found in thousands
in the bird shops, the commonest birds offered for sale are Mynahs,
the two most familiar ones being the Chinese Crested (Aethiopsar
cristatellus) and the Javanese, which of course is brought up from
Singapore.
There were any amount of Finches, Chinese Greenfinches, Siskins,
Tree-Sparrows, these latter in hundreds. I rather think they are eaten
under the nom de plume of " Bice Birds ".
A bird which I was thrilled to see was the lovely Japanese Waxwing
(Bombycilia japonica), a bird which I had always longed to possess. It
was not common on the market and I saw only one other bird besides
a couple of dozen in Mr. Woo's shop, and of these I purchased eight.
This bird is rather smaller than the European Waxwing, but is infinitely
more beautiful, the end of the tail being a beautiful clear rose pink,
the wing feathers all being tipped with crimson, but these tips are not
the flattened-out shaft as they are in the European species ; the wing

coverts are also a bright chestnut red. It is altogether a most desirable
bird, but owing to its eating a large amount of fruit it is not an occupant
for a small cage but should be kept in an aviary. I found these birds
rather difficult to keep, a few succumbed in Johore owing to the bananas
upon which I was feeding them being too fattening, and later on I
lost all the survivors but one through owls or cats frightening them
at night in the aviary. This species is found in the north-east of
Siberia and Kamtschatka, but in the winter migrates to China and
Japan. No one has yet discovered the breeding grounds of this bird*
and consequently its nest and eggs are unknown.
There were quite a few Ruby-throats in the shops, also Blue-throats,
but these latter were not common ; owing to their pugnacious dis-
position all these birds were caged separately and all appeared to be
in good condition. There were many exotic birds including Macaws,
Javan and Ring-necked Parrakeets. I was surprised at the number
of Lovebirds offered for sale, Peach-faced, Masked, etc. ; these were,
I understood, bred and exported from Japan ; the price of most of them
was about 25s. a pair. I was rather tempted to buy a few pairs but
I had hopes of getting much rarer fry and didn't want to get burdened
up with too many birds.
As well as the Japanese Waxwings I hoped to secure some of the
lovely Azure-winged Magpies (Cyanopiea cyana swinhoei ), and even
though Mr. Eustace had placed an order for some several weeks before
my arrival I was unable to secure any. For many years I had desired
to own some of these lovely birds but had never been able to obtain
any. It seems that being a common bird in China the Chinese will
not bother to catch them. In the park adjoining the Zoological Gardens
in Shanghai there must have been hundreds of these birds, in fact
they seemed commoner than the Sparrows. One evening I saw dozens
flying one after another into a berry-bearing tree to feed upon the
fruits.
This bird is one of the smallest of the Crow-like birds but at the
same time is the most beautiful. It has held a fascination for me ever
since I saw the picture of one in my early teens. About the size of an
English Blackbird but appearing larger owing to the long graduated
tail, its plumage is a combination of the softest and most delicate

pastel shades, the feathers being extraordinarily soft and downy.
There is a cap of jet black, the rest of the plumage being a very pale
and delicate grey almost lavender on the breast, the wings and tail
being very pale azure blue, the long tail feathers tipped with white.
The bill, which is black, is singularly slight for a Crow-like bird.
This species must not be confused with the Chinese Blue Pie
(Urocissa erythrorhyncha), a very much larger and altogether different
bird which, though not as plentiful in its native country as the subject
under discussion, is more frequently kept by the Chinese and also more
frequently imported into this country. In fact I have never known
of the Azure-winged Magpie to be offered for sale here, at least not
in my time, though it may have been before the War. The first
1 ever saw alive were in our President's aviaries, and the sight of these
lovely graceful pale blue birds increased my desire a hundredfold to
possess them. On arriving in China my immediate desire was to get
hold of some of these birds, but as mentioned before, in this I was
disappointed, and I left sad at heart thinking that I should never
have my wish fulfilled, but less than four months after my arrival
back in England my proverbial luck in getting the birds I want held
out. A few days before these notes were penned or rather typed, I
received a note from the Chinese cook who had been on the ship I came
home on, saying, " I send you 6 piece bird book 1. 4 piece bird book 2.
2 piece book 3 ! " This referred in a vague way to some pictures of
birds which I had shown him in a Japanese bird book. I hadn't the
remotest notion as to what kind of birds they would be. Imagine my
surprise and joy some days later when I received three bamboo cages,
one containing four Chinese Black-naped Orioles, another two very
rare Bose Pinches, the Kamtschatkan Scarlet Finch ( Erythrina erythrina
grebnitskii) and a Formosan Rose Finch ( Erythrina vinacea formosana ),
the latter clad in a garb of exquisite deep wine red, which colour I have
only seen before in some varieties of pelargonium , but last of all in
the largest cage were six baby Azure-winged Magpies, all exceedingly
dirty but clamouring very noisily for food, what a thrill ! I raced
back from the station where I had been to fetch them and soon had
my treasures in a warm indoor aviary and in a few minutes all the
Magpies had had a thorough bath and in a few days' time they were

looking their old exquisite selves. And all were so tame that I could
pick them up and they would come on to my hand for a mealworm.
Beaten up egg and milk with " Glucose D " poured on sponge cake,
in addition to their ordinary food, brought them into condition in no
time. I never saw birds so assiduous in the care of their plumage ;
probably they realize how beautiful they are !
To get back to Shanghai, I saw several examples of the Common
Chinese Magpie, a bird very similar to our English one ; there were
also quite a number of the Chinese Jays, a bird which is smaller and
much deeper rufus in colour than the European bird and with hardly
any marking on the head. There were also several Chinese Blue Pies
which were very similar to the well-known Indian Occipital Blue Pie.
I purchased more out of pity than anything else two Chinese Red-
back Shrikes ; these wretched birds were tied by the neck to a perch
and every time anyone went near them, they fluttered off their perch
and hung by the neck. I handed them to my bird dealer and asked
him to look after them for me until I left, but after a few days they
both died. I found they had been fed on raw meat.
There were many Chinese White-naped Bulbuls, delightful aviary
birds and very easy to keep. The greatest prize, however, which I
secured were several specimens of the beautiful Derby an Parrakeet.
These birds, I believe, had come down from Szechuan on the borders
of Tibet, which is their home, over a year ago. Some had been sent
abroad, to England I think, but these poor things were the left overs.
They had remained heavily chained to inadequate iron perches for
over twelve months. Unfortunately all the birds were cocks, but the
collector who had brought the Pheasants down to Shanghai from the
Tibetan border kindly gave me a hen bird which he had brought
with him.
Until recent years when Mr. Eustace sent some of these birds to
Europe the Derbyan Parrakeet was almost unknowm to aviculturists.
Even now the birds are not common on the Shanghai market, a few
being brought down on the Yangtsze-kiang River at long intervals.
These birds are closely related to the better known Alexandrine
Parrakeet though entirely different in colour. I secured three cocks
besides the hen given to me ; unfortunately one died through eating

contaminated sand which I secured from Port Said when my own ran
out. The other three are in my aviaries. I know of no other Parrot so
destructive to woodwork as this one. I also received from the collector
who gave me the hen Derbyan, four of the beautiful Slaty-headed
Parrakeets, these came from Szechuan. I don't think they are recorded
from as far north as this, so this may be a sub-species. Unfortunately
two of the birds were in a very bad state and succumbed on the voyage,
but one pair arrived safely and moulted out into most beautiful birds.
They rather resemble the " Plum-head ", but the head is a smoky
bluish grey, the long tails are blue ending in yellow. Next season
I am hoping that they will breed.
Another bird which intrigued me was the strange little Webb's
Crow-Tit (Suthora webhiana), rather resembling in both shape and
demeanour the English Long-tailed Tit but only about half the size.
These tiny birds are common in China and are said to be found in
small flocks in the reed beds by rivers, but judging by their extreme
pugnacity when in captivity I should hardly think that they were
gregarious. If two cages containing these birds are left near together
the birds will nearly tear each other to pieces through the bars. When
the birds arrive from the interior they are packed in incredibly small
cages about four inches square. They make delightful cage birds,
and seem the incarnation of perpetual motion. Their food seems to
consist of everything edible, all manner of seeds, fruit, green food,
insects, etc. I purchased six of these birds which I brought home.
I also noticed other Tits including examples of the Chinese Marsh Tit.
At most of the Chinese bird shops one can purchase the most
beautifully made cages, of such workmanship that no European could
produce ; they have every convenience and are superbly finished down
to the most minute detail. One can also buy all manner of exquisite
little accessories for them, including tiny carved ivory holders for
insects, beautiful little china vessels for holding a flower or a spray
of flowering grass, ivory charms to fit in between the bars to ward off
the " evil eye ", and a hundred and one other things which reflect
the super skill of the maker. The fine cages are fairly expensive but
not as much as one would think, but the Chinese dollar was very low
when I was in China.

Of Larks, there were thousands of the Tientsin species or as we know
it here, the Mongolian Lark. This is quite the favourite cage bird in
China owing to its song. In most cases these birds have good sized
round cages, some often four to six feet high with a little round stand
in the middle about six inches high, and from this the bird sings. Most
of the Larks I saw were very tame. I also saw a few of the ordinary
Chinese Larks.
In one shop I saw a cage full of Pallas's Rose Finches ( Erythrina
rosea), one of the most beautiful of Finches. All the birds were in a
very bad state. Before I left there were only six left and these I purchased.
All these birds were cocks, but later on, strange to say, I saw some hens
in Singapore where they must have been shipped from China ; of these
I purchased several. After the moult these birds lost their brilliant
plumage and became a not unattractive salmon-fawn.
In the shops were many Buntings of sorts including the Yellow-
throated [Emberiza elegans), the Yellow-breasted (E. aureola), the
Chestnut (E. rutila), the Chinese Meadow (E. cioides castaneiceps),
and many others. The Lesser Black-tailed Hawfinch ( Eophona migra-
toria) was very common and the birds were crowded in hundreds into
small cages. There are two species of the Masked Grosbeak [E. per sonata),
one of which is frequently imported into this country, but the other
one about the size of a Thrush is seldom seen here, in fact I have never
come across it mentioned in any book. This latter is a very showy
bird with a huge beak, but really very harmless. I purchased two of
these birds, both cocks, but was unable to get hens. Unfortunately
they were both killed by a Jay in one of my aviaries.
There was a complete absence of any Thrush-like birds except
a single Chinese Blackbird, a bird which differs but slightly from the
European kind. Neither were there any Chats. Most insectivorous
birds, except a very few like the Ruby-throats, seem to be beyond the
scope of the Eastern bird fancier, though a good soft food is made of
dried and powdered insects, but as this is given dry the birds don't
seem to thrive.
In China there are few if any aviculturists as we understand the
word, and although a great many people keep a bird and sometimes
two, no one seems to have aviaries or keeps many birds as we do in

England. One often sees a Chinese gentleman walking along carrying
a bird cage covered with a closely fitting padded cover. He is taking
his bird out for a walk and when he comes to a low wall or similar
place he will take off the cover, place the bird in the sunshine, talk
tc it, and admire its plumage.
I looked around for Pheasants in the shops, but only saw a single
one, a cock Reeve's. All the Chinese Pheasants come from remote and
often inaccessible places, except the common Ring-neck, which is
found everywhere, though through the operation of certain European
game dealers who export hundreds of tons of frozen Pheasants every
year, these birds are now diminishing in most parts of China.
I noticed that there were a great many Mandarin Ducks in the
shops at a very low price. I did not purchase any as I had so many
birds and one is able to get these in England.
The strangest and most peculiar little bird which I secured on the
whole of my trip I procured in Shanghai. It was the only one of its
kind I saw there, a Crow-Tit (Scdeorhynchus gularis), a bird at least
four times as large as the Webb's Crow-Tit and looking not in the least
like it. He was the most comical looking bird I have ever seen, the
sailors on the ship I returned on christened him " Funny Face ".
It certainly is funny, something like a miniature Owl's, with black
beady eyes and a large orange beak very much like a Parrot's, and
couldn't he bite ! The face is very flat and narrow, which helps to give
the bird a strange appearance, the feathers of the head are lengthened
and in moments of excitement are raised into a large crest. Its move-
ments are jerky like those of a mechanical toy. No wonder the scientific
name of the family is Paradoxornithidde.
There were numerous Common and Painted Quail, all in very tiny
cages, also Chinese Bamboo Partridges and the Eastern Red-legged
Partridges.
Plenty of live food can be bought in China even in the winter
time, and it is very varied. One really does not realize what
abject poverty is until one comes to China. Here one sees
a man or woman from the country sitting on a step by the
side of the street in the native city offering for sale a few tiny baskets
of large moth cocoons, a few dozen mantis nests, or a small heap of

wood boring grubs enclosed in willow twigs. These might take him
a week to collect and perhaps if he is lucky he may dispose of them
in the same amount of time for anything up to one dollar (Is. 2d.)
sitting for long hours all day with the temperature well below freezing.
From Shanghai I went to Chinwangtao, a town of incredible dirt
and squalor in the far north of China near the Great Wall. So cold was
it that the harbour was partly frozen in, the ship having to plough its
way through the ice to the wharf. Here I made inquiries regarding
bird shops, the rickshaw boys saying that they knew of one, but on
arrival it was found to be empty. We were taken round to other shops
which had a few birds besides other things. The birds were mainly
Mongolian Larks and a few odd Siskins and Greenfinches. One man
triumphantly brought forth a very poor specimen of a Canary and
informed us that it was a great rarity. We told him that it might be
to him.
There were a great many caged Larks hanging outside the shops
and--I was going to say houses--but the wretched hovels which served
as the homes of the people could hardly go by that name. The Larks
were in very good condition and seemed reconciled to captivity much
more so than the ones seen in England; there is always something very
pathetic about a caged Lark in England, but the Larks there seemed
quite different. One often sees these Larks being carried out for an
airing by their owners, most of the cages being covered with a tight
fitting blue quilted cover which is raised when a suitable situation is
reached. Quite a lot of birds must be kept because I noticed many
cage-maker's shops about the town.
There were few wild birds of any sort, except Gulls and Sparrows.
I doubt whether anything else could stand the intense cold. I was
surprised to see in the miserably stunted trees around the town, hundreds
of nests of the Azure-winged Magpies though there was no sign of
any of the birds, possibly they had gone further south with the advent
of the cold weather.
At Shanghaikuan, an interesting native city which, though on the
Chinese side of the Manchukuo frontier, was nevertheless filled with
Japanese soldiers, there appeared to be no bird shops, though one saw
many Mongolian Larks hanging outside the various bazaars and houses.

These birds appeared quite happy and lively though the temperature
was 20 degrees below freezing-point. Here it was impossible to see
anything of the bird life of the country as one was stopped at every
odd corner by the military of one sort or another, who followed a few
yards behind everywhere one went. On the Great Wall, which I was
told was no longer the Great Wall of China but of Manchukuo !, I saw
hundreds of the Common Chinese, or correctly speaking " Manchukuo "
Magpies ! These were very tame and seemed to be the only birds
not persecuted by the natives. There were also some Buntings flying
about, but I was unable to distinguish their species.
In the native meat and game shops I was sorry to see many sadly
mangled corpses of that magnificent bird the Siberian Great Bustard
{Otis tarda dybowsJcii). These could be bought for a few dollars or yen
which in both cases is worth Is. 2d. These birds are sold to the Europeans
on the various ships which visit the towns in North China and
Manchukuo as " Turkeys ". I also saw in the shops many Black
Storks {Ciconia nigra) and various Duck, also many Sand-Grouse.
In fact strings of frozen Sand-Grouse were brought on board our ship
when we landed at Chinwangtao. I made inquiries about obtaining
live Bustards and Sand-Grouse, but I was told that the birds were
always shot and not taken alive, and also that they were brought from
a long distance, but had I given an order some weeks before my arrival
I might have been able to obtain live ones.
Fortunately I was able, at a later period, to obtain a pair of Pallas's
Sand-Grouse, and these I brought home with me. Sand-Grouse do
not seem to be well known to aviculturists in this country, though they
are very beautiful with their delicately coloured plumage of pale fawn,
yellow, and various shades of brown. As they are desert birds they
cannot stand damp and wet and need a sanded aviary with a dry shed
and a dust bath. Their tiny feathered feet look more like the paws
of a small mammal than those of a bird, and when running they remind
one of the actions of a mechanical toy. Unfortunately they have
a bad habit of flying straight up when startled and banging their heads
against the top of the aviary. Otherwise they are most attractive
aviary birds.
Unfortunately, owing to illness contracted in North China due

to the excessive cold and the dust, I was unable to see much of Man-
chukuo during my stay there. Dairen, the chief exporting city of the
Japanese controlled province of Manchukuo, a straggling nondescript
place of no particular interest, boasts of only one bird shop kept by an
old Japanese woman and her semi-imbecile son. Contrary to the
general impression that the Japanese are one of the cleanest races,
this shop was--I was going to say excessively dirty, but it was not the
shop but the cages. It must have been months since some of them
were cleaned out. A great many cages contained dying and dead birds,
and the cause of death appeared to be lack of food. Here I secured
one of the gems of my collection, a bird which had intrigued me since
my youth, the lovely Japanese Blue Flycatcher (Cyanoptila cyano-
melana), a Bobin-like bird of deep shining blue with a black throat
and white underparts. It reminds one of an American Blue Bird but
is more beautiful.
There were many other birds which I was greatly tempted to buy,
but having so many I had to restrain myself. There was a very fine
specimen of Davison's Ground Thrush (TUrdus sibiricus davisoni),
a very un-Thrushlike bird of uniform dark grey with a very conspicuous
white eyebrow streak. It looked very much like a giant Wood-Swallow.
There were quite a few Warblers, some of these being Gray's Grasshopper
Warbler (Locustella fasciolata). These in common with all the other
" soft-bills " were in fine condition and were fed on a paste made of
ground insects and given in a very liquid state.
There were many Zosterops of different sorts, including both the
Chinese and Japanese, but for the main part these did not look in
very good condition. Of Finches and Buntings there were many, they
included Chinese and Japanese Meadow Buntings, Kusset Sparrows,
Bose Finches, Hoary Bedpolls, Japanese Bullfinches, Chinese Siskins,
and many others, including exotics such as Budgerigars, Zebra Finches,
and a single Golden Pheasant and a few talking Mynahs.
I cursed myself for being such a fool as to wander into these bleak
and inhospitable regions in the winter time for no apparent reason
whatever when I had friends in tropical lands where I would have
been received and made welcome. Already I had lost some of my
birds through pneumonia, including my best Buby-throat, and the

Slaty-headed Parrakeets were looking pretty sick, and I was feeling so
depressed with the cold and desolation that I had no inclination to
go anywhere or do anything.
The only relief to the utter desolation of Dairen was the number
of beautiful Japanese women who flitted about everywhere in their
beautiful national dress looking more like exotic, butterflies that had
been blown off their course than inhabitants of those bleak and dreary
regions. But this is no place to talk of feminine desirability but
sufficient to say that for sheer charm and domestic ability Japanese
women stand far above the rest of their sisters !
There can be little bird life in the populated parts of Manchukuo
for every tree, bush, and shrub is cut down for fuel, even the trees
in the towns are so pitifully pruned for their wood that they are only
left with enough timber compatible with life. In the country there
seems no sign of native vegetation; every hill and mountain is bare
and barren, the soil having eroded many centuries ago through the
cutting down of the timber. Now they are bare rock and will never
to the end of this planet be clothed again with vegetation. So acute
is the fuel problem that even the roots of reeds are dug up for fuel,
and natives of the city will spend hours sifting ship's ashes for a bit
of unburned coal. How and where the numerous Pheasants, of which
one sees large numbers in the shops, manage to exist is rather a mystery
unless they live in forests far inland on the borders of Siberia.
Chefoo, a large native city in the Province of Shantung, proved an
interesting place in so much that one saw here the love the Chinese
have for their birds. As mentioned before there are no aviculturists,
as we know them, in China who have large collections of birds, but
a great many Chinese own one or two birds upon which they lavish
great care and attention, in fact, it looked to me as though they paid
more attention to their birds than their children. Even the labourers
on the docks bring their pets down with them to work and hang the
cages in a sunny spot where the inmates may get the benefit of the
fresh air and welcome winter sunshine and also enliven the drab scene
with their song.
It is a usual sight to see the Chinese taking their birds for a walk--
imagine an average English business man taking his canary out while
walking in the park in the evening !

Most of the birds are covered up whilst the owner is taking them
out, until some suitable place is found and the cage is then uncovered.
All the birds which I saw in private ownership were in good condition,
especially the Larks which formed about 80 per cent of the cage birds
in that part of the world. They were in perfect feather and very tame ;
they seemed to have a knowing look and to understand all that was
going on around them. The cages of these birds were also very clean.
I saw several Crested Larks (Galerida cristata) in Chefoo, these also
appeared to be very tame and totally different from the frantically
fluttering Larks which one used to see in this country.
Ruby-throats were also common cage birds, and I saw several
kept by, what seemed to me, the rather cruel method of having the
bird attached to the perch by a string fastened round the neck; in
spite of this, however, the birds appeared to be in perfect condition,
and the brilliant ruby bib is a good indication of the condition of the
bird. On a week or two&apos;s bad food this ruby colour quickly fades,
in some cases to a pale yellow.
There were also several of the large Masked Hawfinches tied by
the neck, and these always seemed to be in a state of nervous appre-
hension. In Chefoo, Siskins were also a very common cage bird, and
one saw a great many of them in tiny cages hanging outside the native
shops.
Tsintao, perhaps the cleanest and best planned of the North China
coast towns, possessed a single street of bird shops, but what bird
shops they are ! It would break the heart of any real bird lover to
walk up that short hilly street and inspect the filthy dens which con-
stitute Tsintao's ornithological emporiums. None of the cages had
apparently been cleaned out since the shops were opened. One sees
hundreds of birds dying through sheer starvation, Siskins, Crossbills,
Rosefinches, etc., simply begging for food as they make a last desperate
effort before dying. In tiny cages and boxes in dark corners, often
the boxes are so nailed up that one cannot see what is in them, one
finds all manner of wretched victims. There are monkeys nailed up
in boxes which one would think were their coffins, as indeed, alas ! no
doubt they are.
In one store a Chinese woman was sitting on a box-like stool which

served her for a chair at the table where she was sitting having her
meal. It was in such a dark corner that it was impossible to see
adequately. When she got up I noticed the box moved and found on
examination that in it were nailed up three Rheus Monkeys, their
pathetic looking little hands being pushed through the cracks imploring
for food to be given to them. The box was about eight inches square
and about fifteen inches high ! There were Silver Pheasants in all-wire
cages so low that their backs had been rubbed bare. There were also
several miserable looking Eclectus in wretchedly inadequate cages
fed solely on dry maize; how they stood the cold I don't know, for the
temperature was well below freezing even in the shops. There were
Specifer Peafowl with crates built round their bodies so that they were
unable to move, their trains were wrapped up with newspaper ! And
judging by the amount of droppings the birds must have been im-
prisoned thus for many months. In each shop there it seemed worse
than in the previous one, and the owners appeared equally indifferent
to the sufferings of the victims, in spite of the fact that if only a little
care and attention had been given the owner would have had a very
much larger and more saleable stock. On a matter of principle I pur-
chased nothing, though there were several birds which I would have
liked. There were thousands of Pekin Robins in conditions that must
be seen to be believed, so tightly were they packed between two boards
with a strip of wire netting round that each 44 cage " looked like a
sandwich of living birds. I won't narrate any more of the sufferings
of the wretched creatures but suffice it to say that I came away feeling
thoroughly depressed and not a little sick at the sight of so much
misery. There were thousands of Tientsin Larks, but these were the
best off as they were all in separate cages. In the city of Tsintoa one
sees, as in the other Chinese cities, a great many of these Larks being
carried about by the owners or hung outside the shops and bazaars.
A great many of these birds were singing or warbling a low song as
though they were 44 tuning up ", in the sunshine, even though the
temperature was 20 degrees below freezing.
Ruby-throats were very numerous in the shops, in fact one shop
seemed to contain nothing else, most of them tied by a cord round
the neck to the perch, as also were most of the Giant Hawfinches.

By Dr. M. Amsler
When I retired from medical practice at Eton and settled down at
Hawkhurst, Kent, I made sure that my breeding results would be
vastly improved by the change from the murky valley of the Thames
to an open and airy spot about 10 miles from the sea, where fogs are
quite a rare event, and one's birds get a maximum of light and sun,
but these notes are a recital of the almost incredible sequence of
disappointments during 1936.
When I lived at Eton I had eight aviaries. Although four of them
were quite small affairs of 2 or 3 yards in length, the four main
aviaries were built round a solid wooden shed 20 feet by 20 feet, which
was divided into four partitions, each 10 feet square, and opening on
to flights about 12 feet long.
From a spectacular point of view these larger aviaries are the best--*
but for the breeding of birds pure and simple, a small aviary with
only one pair gives the best results every time.
In the above small aviaries I have bred such unusual species as
the Occipital Blue Pie and the Chinese Blue-winged Magpie. Older
readers will also remember my partial successes with Golden-fronted
Fruitsuckers. Young were hatched on three occasions, and once
lived to the age of twelve days. In another of these small flights a
pair of Swainson's Lorikeets fully reared twenty young in two years,
and it must be remembered that the full clutch of these birds is only
two ; in still another, only 12 feet long, a pair of Rosellas reared
seventeen young in one season, two clutches of ten and seven eggs all
hatched and left together for want of room until the end of the season.
The sight of these nineteen birds in one small flight was almost suggestive
of a dealer's cage. Next year the same pair only reared three, but
I suppose they had shot their bolt.
These reminiscences are a digression from my original theme of
lamentation, but they were leading up to a description of my present
aviaries.
The large shelter shed from Eton was taken down, and after much
consultation with haulage contractors it was moved to Hawkhurst,

where it has been re-erected on four courses of bricks, which makes it
considerably higher than before ; also its length has been increased
by one-third, so that it is now 30 feet long instead of 20. This
building is divided into six shelters 10 feet square, each of which has
access through glazed doors to flights 10 feet wide and 30 feet long ;
these are gradually being planted with shrubs which are not wanted
in the garden.
I find the shrubby spiraeas and some of the rather prickly barberries
are much liked as nesting sites by the smaller Finches.
In addition to the above, there are three separate small aviaries
about 10 feet long, each of which has a special trap-door through
which birds can come and go if one wishes to give them their liberty
when feeding young. I have made the mistake of erecting these small
aviaries too near to the main ones--with the result that a liberated
bird at first causes one a good deal of anxiety by fighting some closely
allied species through the wires of the larger flights.
Owing, I suppose, to our proximity to the sea, we get tremendous
gales in these parts. I have been obliged to make special provisions
this winter to prevent the rain blowing into the shelters, which have
once or twice been in a sorry mess after a night of gale and rain, of
which we have had more than our share this autumn and winter.
It is a great comfort to others who have had disappointments to
hear of the failures of their fellows in misfortune, and I think I cannot
do better than go through my notes for the year and record each
calamity in turn.
Beginning with gallinaceous birds, Elliot's Pheasants laid ten
eggs--all infertile.
Monauls --five eggs, three clear, two fertile, and broken by the
broody hen a couple of days before they were due to hatch.
Peacock Pheasants did not lay--probably late-hatched birds
and not sufficiently mature.
Amherst Pheasants laid over twenty eggs--almost all fertile,
and the chicks killed one after another by one of my dogs--since sold.
Result, two fully reared.
Sonnerat's Jungle Fowl, rather wild at first, not quite tame--
did not lay.

Gambel's Quail.-- A handsomer edition, in my opinion, of the
Californian, always as wild as Hawks--&apos;did not lay.
Chinese Painted Quail-- total number of eggs dropped about the
aviary and occasionally laid together in the usual grass nest, over
sixty. The little hen showed no signs of sitting, so in desperation I
put eighteen of these tiny eggs under a small Bantam. To my great
surprise she did not break the eggs, and hatched over a dozen chicks,
but the poor broody was so enormous in comparison with her tiny
chicks that they were all crushed to death within twenty-four hours.
So much for the ground birds. I have served my first year's
apprenticeship with Pheasants. It is not encouraging but, like everyone
else, I hope for better things in 1937.
Bengalese also were not very satisfactory--I evidently have a
superabundance of hens--only about a score were reared, and I found
many clutches of fifteen to twenty eggs, suggesting that several hens
had sat together, and as the cocks are evidently not polygamous a
large number of the eggs were clear.
Amethyst Starlings which, I understand, come from Abyssinia,
are, I consider, very hardy birds and winter perfectly in an aviary
with a dry but unheated shelter. It may be remembered that these
birds bred successfully in 1935 ; this year they again made use of
the same large log nest. The first clutch of three eggs was not incubated
at all, so was removed---this was in June. In July two more eggs were
laid and incubated, and on the 18th one chick had appeared.
I foolishly decided that I would hand-rear the youngster, so as to
encourage the old birds to go to nest again. So I set out on my foul
errand on 29th July, when I at once saw by the parents' behaviour that
something had happened. On looking into the box I found it empty,
and I had to wait nearly half an hour before the hen screwed up her
courage to feed her chick and show me his whereabouts. He was
perched in the middle of a dwarf juniper, where I easily captured him.
How, it is a well-known fact that it is much easier to hand-rear a
callow nestling than one who has just flown, and this bird was no
exception to that rule. I had a great deal of trouble with forced
feeding for the first two or three days, after which all went well until
I gave him (it turned out to be a hen) small broken-up earthworms.

He became very ill indeed, but by dint of perseverance and a diet of
fresb ants' cocoons, be perked up and looked perfect for a few days,
when I stupidly tried a little soft food moistened with fresb milk.
It may or may not bave been due to tbis, but be rapidly got weaker,
lost bis voice, and died on 21st August.
Mr. Hicks reported mycosis of lungs and air-sacs, gapeworms in
tbe trachea--a ben--result, three weeks' bard work, a dead bird, and
the adults never looked at their nest again.
Zebra Finches, four bens (one about ten years old), and two cocks,
did nothing beyond build nests and lay eggs.
Ruficaudas built a large globular nest in a Lonicera nitida in
June ; two young left tbe nest, of which one was drowned by a
rainstorm we bad tbe first night be spent out of bis nest. In August
another similar nest was built in a berberis ; it contained several
young, and one morning after a violent storm I found tbe nest on tbe
ground, with tbe bole most fortunately uppermost. Tbe parents were
feeding tbe young quite happily, but I thought it best to replace tbe
nest in its original position: all went well, and five young flew a few
days later.
Blue Robins are an old and very much inbred pair, tbe progeny
of my original and much written-up pair which came to me in
1926.
These birds went to nest in May. Only three eggs were laid instead
of tbe customary four or five--result two clear and one dead in shell.
After tbis there was a hiatus, and I thought that all was over for tbe
season, but on 11th June there was a good deal of skirmishing with
some Sbamas in tbe next flight, so I looked into a nest-box banging
in tbe outer flight, and found three youngsters a couple of days old.
Tbe old birds were fed regularly, but sparingly, with mealworms, but
as so often happens with these birds, tbe young gradually disappeared,
and on 18th June there was only one chick left, and he was very small
for his age and obviously not thriving.
Thereupon I took my courage in both hands and gave the
parents their liberty, through a trap-door in the flight, first putting
up some small iron bars to prevent the escape of the only other
occupants of that aviary, a pair of Monauls.

By dint of mealworms and a certain amount of careful shepherding,
I soon taught the Blue Birds their way in and out of their home, and
the improvement in the chick was obvious in a very few days. He left
the nest at the age of 23 days, just about a week later than normal,
but was a large, well-coloured bird--a cock.
In an aviary Blue Birds are much inclined to neglect their young
once they have flown, and a never-failing remedy I have found is to
cage them all together for about ten days. In this case, however, the
youngster died a few days later during my absence, and I do not place
the blame for his death on anyone but myself.
Had I given the parents their liberty earlier, I should probably
have reared three of these Kobins.
After her return to her aviary the hen laid three more eggs, but
I had no hope from these, as the cock was no longer feeding her, and
I proved to be right, the eggs were clear.
It is an odd thing about this species that newly imported birds will
go to nest at once and rear one or two nests without fuss or bother,
but in their second and successive years it is a much more difficult
matter.
Can there be some vitamine or hormone which gradually disappears
in captive birds which makes them less able to rear satisfactorily ?
Aviary-bred birds in their first year are not any better in this respect
than their older and acclimatized parents.
Siberian Bullfinches have always been great favourites with me,
and it is many years since I have been without one or more pairs, but
the number of young I have reared can be counted on the fingers of
one hand (excluding the thumb). The young are often neglected after
the first few days, and even when they leave the nest their troubles
are by no means over ; to be quite honest I have only reared one to
live for three or four years.
As these are not valuable birds, I took a chance some years ago
at Eton. When I saw the cock feeding his mate I caught both up and
put them in a cage with a sliding partition. This I hung outside
the aviaries. The cock was liberated first, and after he had learned his
way home, the same process was repeated with the hen, but both
birds were not let out at the same time.

A goodly supply of sunflower seed reminded them that there was
such a place as " Home, sweet home
In a very few days the hen had built a nest in a small juniper in
my rock garden, and it was then necessary to allow the birds to be
together. This was done by trapping both in their cage and removing
the slide for a few hours, after which the hen was again liberated.
As soon as she had laid her first egg, I gave both birds their freedom,
and all went well for a week or so until some marauder spoiled the nest
and broke the eggs. I suspected a cat.
After this I allowed the birds much greater freedom with the result
that the hen built at the top of an apple tree in a garden some two
hundred yards away. The owner of the garden, an Eton master,
happened to be interested in birds, and kept me posted with news.
The birds themselves came home two or three times each day for a
feed, and I had hopes of success until I was told that a Jackdaw had
been seen on the Bullfinches' nest. A very perilous climb up a some-
what shaky ladder confirmed our fears.
After this the birds were put back in their own aviary, when the
hen laid again but did not sit.
The eggs were put under a good feeding hen Canary, but after a few
days she forsook her young. One often reads in the weekly bird papers
of Bullfinches reared by Canaries, but my own experience has always
been that after a few days the foster-mother realizes that these huge-
billed monsters are neither kith nor kin to a Serin, and gives up her
task from sheer fright.
I repeated my liberating experiment here this summer, using the
same cage and methods, but on this occasion the hen disappeared,
never to return, on the second day, leaving a very sad little husband
who spent many a long day calling for her in vain. I hope she is
somewhere in the surrounding woods, and will possibly mate with a
British bird, but I much fear that I owe my loss to an Owl or possibly
a wandering cat.
Aviary birds when first liberated forget that they have two night
enemies--birds or beasts of prey--and heavy rain. They have for the
time forgotten to take the necessary precautions of hiding and sheltering.

summer carrying nesting materials without deciding on a site. Finally
they chose a log nest large enough for a Parakeet. Their first clutch
disappeared ; at their second attempt three young left the nest, two
were drowned by rain, and the third fell into the Pheasants' water
pan, and failed to clamber out. Moral: never have the water too deep,
or if you do, place a stone or brick in the middle on to which a small
bird can scramble.
Peaceful Doves, of which I have only one pair, laid at least a
dozen clutches, in very poor nests it is true ; but something always
happened to the eggs. Several were punctured, and I suspect either
one of my Amethyst Starlings or the Jobi Island White-fronted Doves,
of which there were four or five in that aviary.
Diamond Doves, about four pairs, did not do well, about a dozen
young were reared. I think it is a mistake to keep more than one pair
in an aviary. Mine were all together. I shall remedy this mistake for
the coming season.
Hooded Siskins hardly had a chance. The little cock was mated
to several Canaries, but only fancied two of these. After several failures
and disappointments three young, all cocks, were reared successfully--
one was a " copper ", the second was " ashy " in colour, and the
third much to my surprise and delight was a clear yellow--of little use,
I presume, to the breeder of Eed Canaries, but of scientific interest all
the same.
As I have already mentioned in the Avicultural Magazine, I am
working on completely different lines to the Eed Canary breeder--
I am trying to cross these mules back to the Siskin. I have now
some F 2 and F 3 hens, so have a reasonable chance of fertile eggs. If
all goes well (which I can hardly expect) in three years from now I
should have a bird which is -Jf Hooded Siskin and Canary.
When the Canary breeding operations were over, I gave the little
Eed Siskin his own hen. She was delighted to be liberated from her
cage into a big aviary, but within a day or two she managed to damage
a wing, and I had to replace her in her cage.
These little Finches are very ready to build and lay, but it is a fact
that they are very seldom successfully reared in this country.

first successful breeding in Great Britain was in 1912. Incidentally this
success gave me the greatest thrill of my life and my first Avicultural
Society Medal.
Orange-headed Ground Thrushes for a change were quite satis-
factory, except that they only had one lot of young--again my own
fault.
In my greed and avarice I put the first clutch of four eggs under a
Grey-bird as it is called here, i.e. a Song Thrush. This bird sat well for
a few hours, then pitched out the eggs and departed. The Thrush,
I believe, is one of the most difficult of birds to deceive in this way.
The much larger Blackbird would probably have accepted the Ground
Thrush's comparatively small eggs. My Ground Thrushes took a long
time to find a nesting site to their taste, and finally selected a hanging
arrangement which I have to carry the seed pans, water, etc. They did
not build in their own pot of soft food, which was thoughtful on their
part, but took to one containing white millet.
This arrangement was really rather a satisfactory one, as the
nest, hen, and eggs were literally under my eye, and she became
extremely tame and would eat from my hand both when on her eggs
and also when she had young from the second clutch.
Three were reared without any difficulty whatsoever, at first on
mealworms and finally entirely on earthworms. This last-named
luxury is not easily come by in my Kent soil, so I used to secure
consignments from Eton once or twice each week.
British worms must be extra good, for these three young turned
out splendid specimens, quite definitely larger than their parents,
which I believe were wild-bred and imported birds. But many Indian
birds are hand-reared, and this, of course, may account for the fact
that the young were larger than the old cock and hen. I decided that
I had two hens and one cock, while still in the nest, and my surmise
was correct.
Of Parrot Finches the less said the better ; I had five pairs of
three different species, and did not rear one to leave the nest.
When I mention a Shama, I always wish I were a poet and could
write a fitting rhapsody. With the exception of one or two of the
Niltanas there must be few equally beautiful birds in this world, and

I am not sure that a good hen, notwithstanding her quiet garb, is not
just as beautiful as the cock. Their natural tameness, which of course
is only cupboard love, is an added charm, but I have other species which
are just as fond of the horny mealworm who persistently refuse to
feed from my hand.
Of the scores of Blue Robins I have owned and bred, only two or
three have been " finger-tame ", and many other species who know that
one's presence means " creepy-crawlys " wait until one has gone
next door before coming down for their tit-bits.
All this preamble about Shamas is merely a form of procrastination,
before admitting that they did no good this past season.
I started with a true breeding pair, and in the early summer
Mr. Ezra very kindly gave me a cock and two hens, newly imported.
From them I was able to pick out a pair which had good flights and
were strong on the wing. Within a week they had carried a few straws
into a nesting box, and in ten days from their arrival the first egg was
laid ; there were two more attempts, but as the hen would only put
two or three bits of hay in the nest-box the eggs never hatched.
My old pair took me nearer to success, but here I had another
tragedy. These birds were put into a small aviary to themselves,
a small door for " enlarging " the birds being fitted. During the
incubation of the first lot of eggs I gave the cock a fly round for a
short time each day. This was easy, as the hen alone incubates, and
as far as I have been able to judge, is never fed by the cock.
All I had to do was to shut the shelter door before liberating the
cock ; the nest-box being inside the shelter. All went well except
that the cock spent much of his time fighting the other Shama and
the Blue Robins through the aviary wires, but with patience and
mealworms I always contrived to get them home. One night, however,
I could not find him, but made sure he would turn up 'in the morning.
I was out soon after dawn. We had had sheets of rain during the
night, and there was no sign of my truant bird. All the whistling and
tin-tapping evoked no answer. Moreover, her mate's long absence had
upset the hen Shama, and she had deserted her eggs.
It was with a heavy heart that I went in to lunch some hours later.
As I approached the house a small dark object caught my eye, and on

turning round there was my poor bird following me like a dog, but
no one but myself would have recognized this bedraggled object to be
a Shama ; he was so wet that all his skin areas were bare, and his
flights looked like bare quills.
He did not make the slightest attempt to escape when I went
to pick him up, and after devouring a dozen mealworms and spending
a couple of hours in a sunny cage, was returned to his wife, whom he
rejoined as if nothing had happened, and without any explanation of,
or apology for, the anxious hours of waiting he had caused her.
I have little doubt that he spent the night on an exposed branch
and was nearly drowned by the rainstorm which, coming in the dark,
made it impossible for him to move to a place of shelter.
As I stated above, this kind of thing is probably due to a loss
of precaution following an aviary life, but for all we know many wild
birds may come to an untimely end from the same cause.
The Indian Shama is, of course, the one most frequently imported,
but lovely though he is there are others which are more desirable ;
the sub-species from Java is a much larger and finer bird, and another
sub-species which I have only seen once, and that in Mr. Ezra's collec-
tion, had a white superciliary line--a most beautiful bird.
The next clutch from these birds was not long in appearing. On
this occasion a nest-box was chosen which was hung in the outer flight.
Three young were hatched from four eggs; this time I did not liberate
either parent until the chicks were twenty-four hours old.
The cock had learned his way in and out of the aviary, and the
little hen very quickly learned her lesson. Were it not for the anxiety
which this method of keeping birds always engenders, it is of course
by far the most fascinating way of keeping and breeding birds, especially
the insectivorous kinds. Once the birds have learned their way in
and out of the aviary they do not forget it, even after their
imprisonment, which must take place during the autumn, winter, and
early spring.
All went swimmingly with my little brood, and I had no difficulty
in examining them each day, always choosing a time when I thought
the parents were far away and not watching me.
It is quite amazing how much quicker young birds grow and feather

when their parents have this form of semi-liberty. Each night the
little aviary door was closed; it was always easy to make certain that
the cock was home, but more difficult in the case of the hen, as
she was, of course, brooding her offspring at the bottom of the
nest-box.
After a few days I took to leaving the little liberty door just ajar
so that the birds could come in last thing at night and go out in the
early morning. I also smeared some " Renardine " round the door
to keep away nocturnal marauders such as rats and mice.
One morning, it was on the tenth day, I immediately saw that
something was amiss. The cock Shama was sitting inside the aviary
looking very piano, and evinced none of the usual excitement on
seeing me and my tin of mealworms. I instinctively knew that the hen
was missing, and on looking into the nest-box found three well-feathered
young, dead and stiff, and no signs of the hen.
She had evidently come to an untimely end in the wild.
So ended my season of breeding Shamas. This kind of thing always
leaves one very depressed for a few days. It is the reaction from the
intense pleasure of seeing one's exotic birds happy and at liberty, and
also of knowing that the young are being fed on the fat of the land,
and not restricted to a diet of mealworms, gentles, and possibly ants'
eggs.
One must take comfort in these failures, for to any one who takes
an intelligent interest in our wild birds it must be manifest that the
mortality among the parent birds, and also among the nestlings, is
very great.
This has been brought home to me very forcibly in looking for
and watching the common Robin, which I have so often used as a
foster-parent.
I should estimate that once in every four attempts something
happens to the parents, the nest, the eggs, or the young. Well, hope
springs eternal both among breeding birds and also among aviculturists.
It is always " next time " or " next year ". I had almost forgotten
my Jobi Island White-fronted Doves, latterly called Amethyst Ground
Doves. I do not know who is responsible for the change of name.
Possibly the dealers have found it remunerative to manufacture a

new species. These Doves have spoiled my record of failures, though
even they might have done better.
They have reared six young, and one pair is at the moment (7th
February) just about to hatch out.
The clutch is, of course, two and both eggs usually hatch, but it is
seldom that both young are reared.
Any commotion in the aviary, such as a sudden panic on the part
of a Pheasant or one of their own parents, is liable to disturb the
young and make them leave the nest too early; even so they are usually
reared quite satisfactorily, but it is necessary to see that they are
driven in under shelter at night, and it also behoves one to see they
do not get crushed under foot, for these squabs which fly prematurely
do not perch for the first week or two. These Doves attract more
attention among visitors than any others I have kept ; they are very
hardy and free breeders, but the great drawback I find is the difficulty
in sexing the birds.
Mine are rung, and even so I have a difficult task in seeing any
difference between the males and females, even though I actually know
which is which. Notes on this question which have appeared in the
pages of this journal were misleading and of no help at all.
If you can grab a bird between the first and second egg it is pre-
sumably a hen, and can be marked with a distinctive ring. Any other
bird incubating those eggs is a cock, and can also be marked accordingly.
There is no bowing, cooing, and tail-spreading such as one sees in
many other Doves, but one habit is, I believe , peculiar to the male,
and it is often seen when several of these Doves are kept together :
the bird gets on to the nesting site, bows slightly and " wags " his
tail slowly from side to side. The foregoing and, I fear, very lengthy
notes are the whole truth concerning my failures during the past
season. Were I a complete tyro, who had never bred anything, I might
have been ashamed to put them into print, but I do so knowing that
one's luck must turn sooner or later, and hoping, with my tongue in
my cheek, that the satisfaction which my failures will give to more
successful breeders will next year be turned to green envy.

I consider that great credit is due to Mr. S. Legg, the Manager
of the Palace Show, for his determined and successful efforts to stage
the Annual Bird Show, in face of almost insuperable difficulties. When
the Crystal Palace was burnt down it was thought by many that it
would be impossible to hold the Show this year. The Borland Hall
was chosen as a site and under the circumstances it proved satisfactory.
It is true that on the Saturday the Hall was at times overcrowded,
but this only served to emphasize the wonderful interest that is shown
in birds of all descriptions by a section of the British public. Perhaps
the lighting arrangements were not all that could be desired, but it
was obvious that this was a most difficult hurdle to negotiate. Many
of the exhibits did not show to advantage in subdued light, but one
heard few complaints and we are after all a philosophical race,
and it was nice to hear such remarks as this, " Well, they did their
best and all credit to them." The Pheasants suffered rather badly in
this respect and another year it is hoped that each pen will be provided
with a small electric bulb placed in one corner. I should have dearly
loved to examine minutely all the small bird exhibits, and been in
a position to discuss them now, but time only permitted of a very
cursory glance, as I was busily engaged meeting many members of
the O.P.S., attending our meeting, and admiring the wonderful show
of Pheasants. I heard it said by an authority on small birds that these
exhibits were well up to the standard of recent years, particularly as
to condition. When one passed in front of the many rows of charming
birds, one could only wish that the many people who were passing the
Hall could have seen them. It is rather sad to think that millions of our
fellow countrymen are utterly ignorant of the beauty of bird life and
also that the exquisite song provided by these sweet creatures is utterly
lost on them. What such people miss in life ! A dreary, monotonous
life can be enlivened and sweetened by taking an interest in these
wonderful creations and a comparative few are fortunate enough to
be aware of the delights that bird life holds out for those who will
only use their eyes and ears to the best advantage. Our public will

P. J. Lambert--The Palace Show
listen in strained and ecstatic bliss to the bleating inane noise made
by so-called rhythmic singers in our dance bands, and yet if this same
person hears the pure sweet song of a little Wren, a Garden Warbler
(surely the sweetest song of our British birds ?), a Robin, or a Thrush,
he will pass by and the glorious music falls on deaf ears. The hideous
song of a nigger with a face like a gargoyle, mouthing meaningless
words and ugly music will appeal, yet the song of a bird leaves this
person cold. Truly we are a strange people. I wonder what our forbears
would think of the monstrous noises that are broadcast by some
of our dance bands. I consider they pollute the ether and are unworthy
of our great musical traditions. But I was asked to write a critique
on the Palace Show not a criticism of modern music, and I am sure
our Editor and my readers are impatient. There really was a wonderful
display of Pheasants at the Palace Show, and I think it will be safe
to say that never before in any country of the world has such a varied
and gorgeous collection been staged for our edification. There were
some fifty-eight exhibits and included in this most satisfactory number
we saw the following species in all the glory of their magnificent plumage:
Tragopan, Impeyan, Peacock Pheasant, Golden, Amherst, Lineated,
Nepal, Swinhoe, Edward's, Reeve's, Crossoptilon, Fireback, and also
a very fine Black-winged Peacock. The latter was a novel entry but
after all why not ? It is surely a species of Pheasant and if it is not,
then how should it be classified ? It is interesting to note that this
same bird was sent to the Caterham Show and was there awarded first
prise in the A.O.S. class of Pheasants. There was a strange coincidence
at this Palace Show and surely a very happy one ? Last year our late
President, Mr. G. Blay, presented the Society with a magnificent
cup which will always be known as the " Blay Cup ". Last year the
late Mr. G. Blay won this cup with a fine Edward's and this year his
daughter, Miss Margot Blay, won it with a Blue Crossoptilon. Thus
she showed in unmistakable manner that she is determined to make
the winning of this cup a family tradition. In this A.O.S. class a well
shown Edward's was placed second, the third being allotted to a grand
Impeyan cock, resplendent in its shining armour--this was the property
of Miss M. Blay, she is very persistent. It seemed extraordinary that
such species as Tragopan, Peacock Pheasants, etc., should be passed

over and yet. this only proved that the competition was exceedingly
keen, as indeed it was. In the Amherst class yet another coincidence.
The first prize was awarded to a cock that won the same distinction
at the previous Palace Show. This bird was bred by a member who
sold it as a " yearling " to Mrs. Burchett, the winner last year. She
then sold it back to the original owner, so the first prize was won by
the actual breeder of this first-class specimen. The second prize fell
to Mr. Wilson, another fine bird, but possibly lacking that slenderness
of body which is one of the main characteristics of this Pheasant.
The third prize was also a fine specimen and this bird has been shown
at many shows in Great Britain, with variable success; but I
consider it well deserved the distinction it now gained. The Golden
class was rather mixed, and since the Show Mr. Pooks has written
to me and expressed the opinion that our British Golden Pheasants
are rather poor in face colour and he is sure that this is due to in-
breeding. I am convinced he is right. The first prize was given to a
very colourful bird owned by Mr. Roderick; second, Miss Blay (there
is no getting away from this name); and third, Mr. Codner. Lord
Tavistock had an unenviable job in making these awards. I take this
opportunity of thanking him for the able manner in which he judged
the Pheasant section and his efforts were appreciated by all. So much
for the official awards. The O.P.S. cash and special prizes were judged
by Mr. Fooks. I was in the Hall when he performed this difficult
task. I was amazed at the care and trouble he took. This expert gazed
long and earnestly at each exhibit, it was obvious he knew the desired
points, and when a decision was made, it was final. It was most kind
of Mr. Fooks to undertake this judging and it was intricate and shall
I say " catchy " ? I will run through these awards as they are in-
teresting. The best shown Pheasant in the Show was awarded to a
most gorgeous Satyr Tragopan; this bird appeared to be aware of its
loveliness, stretching its neck and gazing around in complete unconcern,
not a feather ruffled and the plumage quite perfect. The second prize
in this award was won by Miss M. Blay (I must be content with Miss B.
in future) with a charming little Ohinquis Peacock Pheasant and, if
I am not mistaken, this same bird was placed second last year in the
A.O.S. class at the Palace Show. A special prize awarded to the best

Silver was won by Mr. Armitage, a splendid bird this, second by
Mrs. W. Reynolds Sams. Best Fireback, Miss B., this was a delightful
specimen of a Vieillot Fireback. The best Amherst went to the winner
as previously awarded by Lord Tavistock. Best Reeve's, Dr. J. M.
Derscheid. Best Swinhoe, also Dr. J. M. Derscheid. Best Silver,
Golden, or Amherst, again given to the Amherst that won in the Amherst
class, surely this must have been a wellnigh perfect specimen. Rarest
Pheasant shown was awarded to Dr. J. M. Derscheid, who showed a
pure Lineated cock. This was a most interesting and thoroughly
deserved success. Personally I had never before seen a pure Lineated,
although so-called specimens abound, but these are only crosses between
Silver X Nepal or Horsfield. It is a very beautiful and I can say a
" clean cut " bird and would that more specimens were available.
It was a fine sporting move on the part of Dr. Derscheid to send six
valuable and fine Pheasants to this show, and our Society should feel
grateful to this gentleman for sending over from Belgium at great cost
these exhibits. As I have said this Lineated cock was awarded the
prize for the rarest Pheasant shown, and Mr. Fooks was subtle in
granting this award, for it does not follow that the rarest bird is
necessarily the most costly. Apart from any judged awards, the Lady
Lilford Trophy was won by Mr. Botting. This trophy is presented
to the member of the O.P.S. who wins most points at shows in Great
Britain which are patronized by the Society. I think Mr. Botting won
this cup with ease, for throughout the season he has consistently won
at all provincial shows. Finally the special award for the best collection
of Pheasants shown was won by the writer of these notes, and I was
indeed a proud and happy man. I may also mention that I won the
magnificent shield kindly presented by Cage Birds to the member
who gained the second highest number of points at all shows. I thank
Cage Birds for this award. The Pheasants shown at Borland Hall
caused considerable interest, and this is the first time in the history
of our country that a truly representative exhibition of Pheasants
has been staged. I am absolutely convinced that the showing of such
beautiful and colourful birds must react in favour of aviculture generally.
It was an education to many thousands of people who, up to that
time, associated the word " Pheasant " with our covert Pheasant, and

had no notion of the many species and varieties that are to be seen, not

Elsewhere in this Magazine Mr. Lambert has written notes on the
Pheasants that were displayed at the Palace Show, and I will tell
you of what took place at the General Meeting.
The Committee was most gratified to welcome over sixty members
at this meeting. Glancing through the names, I find that these members
live in all parts of Great Britain, even two members came from the
Continent, Dr. J. M. Derscheid and Mr. F. E. Fooks. Mr. Lambert
was asked to take the chair in virtue of his position of Chairman of
the Committee. The members were immediately asked to stand in
silence for one minute in memory of our late President, Mr. G. Blay.
Many important matters were down for discussion, and perhaps
the showing of Pheasants was the topic that elicited the most fervent
debate. It was fully decided that next year we should endeavour
to arrange for combined travelling and show pens. The advantage
of this method will be obvious to all. The meeting felt that a sub-
committee of three members, other than the General Committee,
should be appointed, this committee to concentrate on obtaining new
members and general publicity. Messrs. Edwards, Botting, and
Holmes were elected, and Mr. Edwards was appointed secretary.
I hope this sub-committee or, as it will be known, the " Publicity"

Committee, will double our membership in a year ; there are many
methods of bringing Ornamental Pheasants to the notice of the
public, and every avenue will be explored in doing this.
It was decided that twelve or more Vice-Presidents should be
elected, six from Great Britain and six from countries other than
the British Isles. It will be noticed that once again our Society have
emphasized the point that we are world-wide, not merely British.
I must not forget to mention that the O.P.S. were kind enough to
present me with a travelling clock : I am most proud of this, and it is
now one of my most treasured possessions. Many other matters of
minor importance were discussed, but I was so pleased with the
enthusiasm that was shown and the interest that was displayed in
every matter that was brought up.
At the Show I enrolled eighteen more members, and I think I
may be allowed to mention that Mr. Lambert secured a new member
for the Avicultural Society, but I do not think he got one for
the O.P.S. !

IJIMA'S PHEASANT

The gorgeous bird represented on the adjoining plate is altogether
the rarest and the most beautiful of the Copper Pheasants of Japan.
It lives in the south of Kyusiu Island, the north of which, as well as
the southern districts of Hondo, the main island (also called Nippon),
being the home of the true Soemmering's Pheasant.
It is probably correct to consider Ijima's Pheasant as a sub-species of
S. scemmeringii as the only difference between the two birds is the white
patch on the rump of the former, and there are many intermediate
between them, some specimens showing just a few spots. This white
patch has metallic silvery shine, unique in birds, I think.
I have possessed several Ijima's Pheasants at Cleres, thanks to the
kindness of my Japanese friends, Prince Taka-Tsukasa and Dr. N.
Kuroda. They are just as strong as any other Copper Pheasants.
I still have a hen, and I hope to receive a cock soon, mine having died
last year after ten years in captivity. He was the father of many hybrids
with S. scintillans and S. reevesii.

This month I propose taking readers round the larger Parrot
House to hear about the more interesting Cockatoos and Parrots to
be found there.
There has recently been presented to the Zoo, a Slender-billed
Cockatoo ( Licnetis tenuirostris), Australia, aged 85 years. " Old Bill
alias " George " is at present in the news, having been a star turn
at a television talk given by Mr. Seth-Smith, also on the radio at the
children's hour, at a talk given by the " Zoo Man ", and he was also
an exhibit at one of the scientific meetings held at the Zoo, where he
was so awed when confronted by the distinguished and solemn gathering,
that he at once said to his keeper, " Is it all right ? " His vocabulary
is wonderful, and he is a most amusing bird full of character. I under-
stand that when introduced to Professor Huxley, he exclaimed, "You
red-headed old rat ! " much to the amusement of the Secretary, who
though so learned is gifted with a very keen sense of humour !
The Zoo have three of these birds, one a youngster and very tame.
Near the Slender-bills is a pair of the pretty Boseate Cockatoos [Kakatoe
roseicapilla) , from Australia, so common in pre-ban days, then close
by the Great Black Cockatoo (Microglossus aterrimus), Aru Islands--
the home of the King Bird of Paradise ; what a contrast to this great
black fellow with his huge beak, pink skin on cheeks, and large
crest !
Next is housed the Banksian Cockatoo ( Calyptorhynchis banJcsi),
from East Australia, also large and black.
Farther along on the other side of the Slender-bills, we come to
some treasures, three tiny Cockatoos, it is difficult to say which is
the most desirable. All are rare, and nearly impossible to obtain
nowadays. Goffin's Cockatoo [Kakatoe gojfni), from Tenimber Island ;
the Bed-vented Cockatoo [K. haematuropygia), Philippine Islands,
very similar, but with red showing under the tail, and last, but most
charming of all, the Dwarf Sulphur-crested Cockatoo (K. parvula),
from Java, a miniature replica of the Lesser Sulphur-crested found in
Celebes. The Zoo also have a very fine pair of these, and a pair of the^

N. Wharton-Tigar--Notes from the London Zoo 97
Ganga Cockatoo (Callocorydon fimbriata) from New South Wales.
Soft grey is the prevailing colour; the hen plucks the cock, and has
deprived him of his strange top-knot!
Then there is the Great Sulphur-crested Cockatoo (K. galerita),
Australia, and the Triton (Cacatua triton) from New Guinea, differing
only in having blue skin round the eye ; and the Great White-crested
Cockatoo ( K . alba) from the Island of Halnaheira, all white ; and a
pair of the Kose-crested Cockatoo (. K . moluccensis) from Ceram ; one
of these is delightfully tame and friendly.
Now we come to the most beautiful of all, a pair of Leadbeater's
Cockatoos ( K . leadbeateri), from Australia. White and pale pink
below, with a salmon-red crest, not much larger than the Lesser Sulphur-
crested. Not far from these is the rarest Parrot in the collection, a
tiny Macaw, the Gold-necked (Ara aureicollis), brought from East
Bolivia by Mr. Walter Goodfellow, the famous collector, when on
Government duty there during the War years. He was in the wilds
indeed, for it was a month's ride to the nearest telegraph office, a
clearing in a great forest district, and these small Macaws came in
hundreds to some water holes there, from May to September, when
they disappeared. This bird has been seventeen years in the collection,
and is housed for company with a home-bred Illiger's Macaw, so common
in Brazil (Ara maracana ), and next to them is an example of A. nobilis,
also from Brazil.
Among the Amazon Parrots I admired the Green-cheeked Parrot
(Amazona viridigen), bright green with vivid green cheeks, red fore-
head extending well back on top of the head. A patch of purple
behind the eye. Near by is the Yellow-faced Parrot (Amazona xanthops),
Central Brazil, grey green with yellow head and cheeks, yellow below,
and yellowish eye, whitish beak. Then follow two examples of the
very handsome Levaillant's (Amazona levaillanti), South America.
The Zoo have an example of the Imperial Parrot (Amazona im-
perials) from the South of Dominica, a huge Parrot with the head,
neck, and breast a wonderful dark reddish plum, the back green ;
this is a very tame bird now showing signs of age.
There is also a very fine pair of Guilding's Parrot (Amazonaguildingi),
very large and handsome, in shades of yellow, orange, brown, and blue,

98 N. Wharton-Tigar--Notes from the London Zoo
St. Vincent, West Indies. This and the preceding variety are said
to be almost extinct, and are exceedingly rare.
In another large aviary cage there are a pair of the Mealy Parrot
[Amazona farinosa), British Guiana. Another large variety, soft
green in colour as if powdered, the cock has a yellow frontal patch,
eye rich brown, with white surround.
To return to the smaller varieties, Lesson's Parrot [Amazona lilacina),
Ecuador, a lovely colour on head. Next to this the Festive [Amazona
festiva), East Peru, comparatively dull looking, and Bodin's Parrot,
a rare new acquisition from Venezuela, with a beautiful red frontal band,
soft powder-blue cheeks, and very tame. Next, a pair of Orange-
winged [Amazona amazonica), from Colombia ; and the good talking
variety, the Golden-naped [Amazona auripalliata), Central America :
and lastly of this group there are the very recent additions, the Yellow-
shouldered [Amazona ochroptera), Venezuela ; the Yellow-cheeked
[Amazona autumnalis), very beautiful, from Mexico ; and the Panama
Parrot [Amazona ochrocephala panamensis).
Belonging to quite a different group is an example of the Hawk-
headed Parrot [Deroptyus accipitrinus), a beautiful little Parrot, with
feathers round the neck, which it can raise like a collarette.
At the far end of the House are to be found many fine examples
of the well-known Grey Parrot [Psittacus erithacus). from West Africa,
and two examples of the Timneh Parrot [P. timneh), West Africa.
Other African varieties housed here include the Brown-necked
Parrot from Rhodesia [Poecephalus fuscicollis), very hard to establish
when first imported. Jardine's Parrot [Poecephalus gulielmi), West
Africa, a lovely little Parrot, reddish-orange forehead and vivid green
wings speckled with black, tail also black. A very rare bird this, and
even more so are the lovely pair of an allied species from the Aberdare
Mountains, the Masai Red-headed Parrot [Poecephalus gulielmi
masaicus), and to conclude, I will mention two gems from the East,
the very tiny and rare Blue-rumped Parrot [Psittinus cyanuros), Malay
States ; there are two cocks and a hen. In the cock the head is a soft
blue grey, merging to almost black on back, wings green mottled
with black, tail very light green ; the hen is duller altogether, and
from Celebes the Racket-tailed Parrot [Prioniturus platurus), a most

A THEORY

Nature has been very lavish with the Pheasant family in the
matter of colour ; they are a highly specialized family in many respects.
Our covert Pheasant is really exotically decorated--a handsome bird
indeed is the cock, especially in the spring. But our Pheasant is really
a " mongrel "--and a mystery. A mongrel because it is a cross
between several species, and a mystery because no one really knows
how or whence it came to these Isles.
Now, it is known that the Pheasant has been a much prized bird
in this country for many centuries. W. B. Tegetmeier, in his authori-
tative work Pheasants, quotes some very interesting data. He mentions
that the tract from the " bill of fare drawn up by Harold for the
Canons household a.d. 1059 ", makes reference to Pheasants, and it is
urged that this mention of Pheasants shows that these birds had
become naturalized in England before the Norman Invasion, and that,
as the English and Danes were not recorded as introducers of strange
animals, it is fair presumptive evidence that Pheasants were introduced
by the Homans. These references in old writings are rather quaint.
For instance :--
" xvj. Nov. 1532 :

Mention of Pheasants occurs, also, in the Privy Purse Expenses of
Elizabeth of York, in the entry : " The same day to Richard Mylner
of Byndfeld for bringing a present of fesauntes cokkes to the Queen
to Westminster . . . vs." and the reader will find other interesting
references in Tegetmeier's Pheasants.
Not Indigenous to Britain ?
The theory that the Romans introduced Pheasants to Britain is
not really convincing, and I prefer the theory that they introduced
themselves from the Continent. They are fast flying, but are not
capable of sustained flight--not so that they can be credited with
having flown the English Channel. But let us consider the history of
the Channel. It is generally accepted that, thousands of years ago,
Britain was not an island but was connected with France ; in fact
aeons ago the whole of East Anglia was joined to the mainland of
Holland and Germany in parts, and possibly the Rivers Humber and
Elbe and the Rivers Thames and Schelde connected up to discharge
their waters into the North Sea and the Atlantic respectively. Soundings
taken reveal underwater channels to-day, and these run in the directions
indicated by the dotted lines shown on the map. However that may
be, what should have prevented the Pheasant from walking across that
mainland, if only across that land which now forms the Straits of
Dover ?
This theory as to how the Pheasant came to Britain has the merit
of being at least more in accordance with the facts. Fossil bones of
Pheasants found in Great Britain have in some cases been held to be
too ancient to be dated since the coming of the Romans. If this one
discovery were established as a fact, it would definitely discount the
theory that the Romans introduced this splendid bird to our country.

form throughout the country. It was then, as it is now, possibly the
most handsome bird in Britain, and right down the centuries it has
been highly valued for purposes of sport and as an article of food.
It has never become domesticated in the real sense of the word,
nor will it ever become domesticated. Its first stages of life may
bring it in contact with man ; it may be reared under a domesticated
hen which is man-tainted ; it may be fed by man and accept human
attention . . . then, it begins to stray from the well provided coverts,
going farther and farther afield. The voice of its ancestors--the
Blacknecks that roamed across Asia, that fed on the marshes that are
now a mighty Channel, and that lived and died midst the dangers of
a Britain that was a vast jungle--The Voice whispers to it down
through the centuries, and this man-reared Pheasant is wild, alert,
and wary, ready to run at a hint of danger, and ready to battle for his
harem of hens in the spring of the year. A handsome untractable
creature, feathered in purples and golds.

MONGREL BIRD A KINGLY EPICURE--HOW IT INTERBRED WITH
OTHERS--THE BLACK PHEASANT: WHAT IS IT?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9667631875" page_id="56321925"  page_num="101" year="" vol="">
Until fairly recent times, the Pheasant known to Britain was the
Blackneck ( Phasianus colchicus). Over two hundred years ago, the
Chinese Ringneck (P. torquatus) was imported and turned loose in
the coverts, where it freely interbred with the Blackneck, so that
within a hundred years the cross-bred birds were as common as the
Blackneck.
Later, the Japanese Versicolor (P. versicolor), and lastly the
Mongolian (P. mongolicus), were similarly introduced by man, and they
too interbred with the Blackneck, the Ringneck, and the Blackneck-
Ringneck hybrids, so it will be appreciated that the Pheasant we are
pleased to call the British Pheasant is really a mongrel, and the product
of many races. It would be a hard task to sort out and classify the
varieties of the types which are to-day found in this country, so all
the varieties are grouped together as one species and called Phasianus
colchicus, which is the same name as that by which the Old English
Pheasant--the Blackneck--is known.

G. H. Edwards--Pheasants
A New Pheasant
We have seen how the Pheasant, such a familiar sight in the country-
side of these Islands, has been interbred. We know that the Pheasant,
now commonly called the English Ringneck (P. colchicus) is the result
of the hybridization of four Pheasants, but colchicus is the strongest
blood. The English Ringneck now breeds almost true to type in many
districts. It is possible to tell, from observation, the predominant
blood of a Pheasant, for it will be borne in mind that although such
extensive hybridization has merged the general characteristics of each
species, certain features will give the clue to the strongest blood ; for
instance, a black-collared bird will give you an idea of the old Black-
neck ; a white collar will show the Pheasant to be a hybrid with a
predominance of Chinese blood ; the Mongolian blood results in a
lighter, and somewhat larger Pheasant. The clue to&apos; Versicolor blood
is that the Pheasant has greenish and darker feathering.
Some fifteen years ago, a new Pheasant appeared in Britain. It
was a mutant, and it was later discovered in other parts of Europe.
It is now fairly common in this country, and is known as Phasianus
tenebrosus, or the Black Pheasant. The hen, as is the case with all
mutant Pheasants, is chocolate in colour.

Perhaps the Original Pheasant
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999574857142857" page_id="56321926"  page_num="102" year="" vol="">
A popular theory is that P. tenebrosus is a " sport " from the mixed
blood of our Pheasants, but many authorities do not subscribe to that
view. They hold that if it is a " sport ", th e first pair caught up would
not have bred true to type, as in fact they did.
Many believe in the reasonable theory that this Pheasant is a
reversion to an old type--possibly the original Pheasant as it appeared
many millions of years ago. It is thrilling to think that when we look
at the Black Pheasant, we are looking at a bird that walked the earth
when man was primitive and as wary as the Pheasant itself. So many
types of phasianus have been hybridizing in Great Britain and Europe
for centuries that it is possible that it has brought out the oldest
and strongest blood, and re-created, as it were, the original bird from
which in course of millions of years, the various species evolved. Let
it be said, too, that the Black Pheasant is extremely virile, and the

chicks are hardy and easier to rear than any Pheasants--much easier
than poultry chicks. Yes, this seems a reasonable theory. Many
varieties of flowers have been created by gardeners, by selection and
growing on prepared soils. Call the soil environment, and remember
that Nature selects by eliminating the unfit. When these " varieties "
are well established, they may by a different environment develop
characteristics which make them a new species ; or hybridism may
evolve a new species, but if they are allowed to run wild and inter-
pollenate, they may alter considerably and eventually revert to type.
This may very well be what has happened with regard to the Black
Pheasant.
Valued as Food
We do not know the complete history of the Pheasant, but we do
know that it has been valued as an article of food since the eleventh
century, and esteemed as a meat for kings and noblemen. Nowadays,
the mongrel Pheasant is still the epicure's choice as a delicacy amongst
game, and is still a costly delicacy, though not considered as a dish
exclusively for kings and noblemen !
However, the Pheasant has maintained its popularity from a
gastronomic point of view, and has maintained its popularity as the
most strikingly handsome member of our birds.
A picture of a Pheasant searching for acorns beneath an autumn-
painted oak . . . would not that conjure up visions of a typical English
countryside scene and make the most hardened exile feel his loss ?

MEROPS APIASTER

A few aviculturists will, perhaps, remember seeing a collection
of Eastern birds brought back last spring by Mr. Webb. Curiously
enough, however, perhaps the most beautiful bird in the collection
was a European species. This was an example of the European Bee-
eater (.Merops apiaster) caught on migration in mid-Mediterranean.

A. Chaplin--Merops apiaster
Mr. Webb, who, as we all know, is a master in the art of keeping alive
the more stubbornly delicate birds, was able to bring this awkward
animal home by cramming it with meat: it always refused to feed
itself. Although, on arrival, it was as wild as a bird can be, I was
unable to resist buying it; I am glad that this was so. For a few days
it was crammed with meat and meal-worms and then, by a pleasantly
tempered weather, I tied up its flight-feathers and took it into the
garden. At first it did nought but try to escape, so that I decided to
pretend it was a newly caught peregrine. By this I mean that I applied
to it the usual methods of taming a falcon. Every time it jumped to
the ground it was replaced on my fist or the arm of a chair. When,
gently but firmly, it was at last sufficiently worn out to remain sitting
on my hand so long as my thumbs were held lightly above its back,
then did we together walk along the garden paths, now fast, now slow.
As soon as it had become subdued enough to shuffle its feathers while
perched on my hand, the time had come to attempt to induce it to
feed itself. So, allowing it to return to its natural status as a Bee-eater,
it was held near a flowering shrub, around which were busy innumerable
bees. At first, as expected, it payed no heed, but at last the sultry
sound of hungry hymenoptera proved too much. There was a snap
and a little struggling brown and yellow thing was being manipulated
in a sharp and gracefully curved bill. Each bee, bumble or honey,
as it was caught was manoeuvred until held by the tail, which was
then squeezed until a spurt of liquid told that the creature had been
put out of action. Later, when the bird was tame enough to eat most
varieties of insects, bee-like hover-flies were swallowed instantaneously
and were distinguished at once from their venomous replicas. Finally
the Bee-eater was domesticated enough to catch meal-worms, of which
it became very fond.
Unfortunately, after many days of bee-regime, this charming animal
became so strong that it sailed away with tissues renewed.

Astrapia stephanise
By P. H. Maxwell
Tiiis illustration is of a very lovely Bird of Paradise, named after
the Crown Princess of Austria in the last century.
The male has a green head of which the crown is a dark blue : the
back is dark brown and the wings are black: the breast is reddish brown
which nearly extends to the crop which is green, with a small band of
yellow in between : the tail, which is very long, is composed of pinkish
brown feathers. It is used for courting.
The female has a dark black head and a speckled brown breast:
the tail is long like the male's.
The nest of this bird is composed of grasses and small twigs : its
habits in the wild state are very imperfectly known. It has once been
known to attempt to breed in captivity.
Its habitat is the mountains of Eastern New Guinea.

These three operations normally appear to be quite easy to all
amateurs. In practice, it is not quite so, if perfect and complete success
are to be obtained. There exists in the rearing of young Pheasants,
as in all things, a certain contradiction between the quality and
quantity.
Importation
The importation of rare species likely to become extinct is generally
an affair of importance. Collectors and importers are very little known
</bodyText>

106 Y. Malisoux--The O.P.S. Must Save Many Rare Pheasants
to amateurs in general. It is only the zoos and important ornithologists
which are really helped by importation. The less known amateur is
often afraid to buy direct from the importers. He knows that his
personal influence is nil, and rightly or wrongly, he thinks that he is
offered only those Pheasants that are left over. The zoos and im-
portant ornithologists buy under good conditions because the importers
fear to lose their clients. Other reasons are that amateurs, large and
small, have not often sufficient or good enough space at their disposal
and perhaps their aviaries are indifferent. Space is limited, as are
finances. They do not care to have imported birds, which might
introduce contagious diseases, unless they can keep them in quarantine
under observation, which means cages of aviaries apart and some
distance away.
Reproduction
Although the superiority of the zoos and important collectors,
collectors who wish to buy rare Pheasants but will not sell, is over-
whelming, the modest amateur's possibilities are improving in regard
to reproduction, the chief factor being not the birds themselves but
the care and attention which is given them. Here it is necessary to
distinguish the ordinary zoos from large private collectors. The zoos
are not sufficiently equipped for reproduction because of insufficient
aviaries, many visitors, etc., and a great rarity is often spoilt when
thus confined.
The large collector ornithologist, that is to say the collector who
is not just contented to put his birds in a cage or aviary to be fed
anyhow by his keeper in an uninterested way, this collector appears
to be best situated for the reproduction of imported Pheasants, with
ample ground at his disposal and also numbers of aviaries turfed and
liberally planted with shrubs, bushes, and fir trees, etc.
The amateur of less importance can evidently obtain reproduction
from imported birds, but generally his chances are far more remote.
It is not for him to try rarities but for the ornithological collector,
who has every chance of success. The small amateur can also buy
rare imported birds if he gets the chance. If he wants to breed them

himself his chances of success are smaller than those of the big orni-
thological collector. So he risks not only the loss of his money, but far
worse, he is wasting invaluable pairs which cannot be easily replaced.

Rearing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.94096084375" page_id="56321935"  page_num="107" year="" vol="">
Here the small amateur has all the advantage. Rearing is before
everything else a question of care, multiple and minute, if success
is to be complete and certain, which is required for all rare species,
but this precision is not compatible with a large number of birds.
The competence and goodwill of the person looking after them is not
in question, but the fact is that it is absolutely impossible to obtain
complete success with, for example, six chicks of a new species if one
has to find a suitable feeding formula and at the same time look after
a large collection. We have seen that it is generally the large collector
who possesses the rarer species. The following two points are the
reasons why the large collector and the rearing specialist cannot be
confounded in the raising of young Pheasants :--
(1) Up to two months it is necessary to avoid contamination .--The
question of hygiene in connection with the hen. This makes rearing
impossible with a hen in a garden or field. The hen brooding the chicks
and the ground can be relatively clean but never absolutely, or in
any case you cannot be certain that they will not contaminate the
chicks. Hens and ground might be inoffensive to species which one
already possesses but not to a new, more delicate, or simply different
species.
(2) It is necessary to feed the chicles in a suitable manner. --Young
Pheasants which run about a garden can become contaminated. On
the other hand they feed in a satisfactory and appropriate manner.
They choose the food which suits them best. If they are shut in an
hygienic cage and brooder, it is not so. Certainly the causes of infection
are eliminated but the choice of food is suppressed.
It is therefore necessary that the breeder himself finds them a
complete alimentary formula, and this should be infinitely varied.
Altogether young Pheasants can be divided into three cate-
gories :--
(1) Those that can digest any food that is more or less suitable
and which can stand being fed regular meals.

108 Y. Malisoux--The O.P.S. Must Save Many Rare Pheasants
(2) Those which require more delicate food but can also stand
regular meals.
(3) Those which cannot stand regular meals and require (or they

<bodyText confidence="0.977799705882353" page_id="56321936"  page_num="108" year="" vol="">
will die) very small but frequent quantities of specially digestible
food. One might say that it is, therefore, sufficient to classify them
in categories. Not at all. This classification is not possible. To begin
with in the same species you find birds with different digestive capability.
Feeble germination, an egg which has been transported from some
distance, faulty incubation, etc., are often the causes of a chick passing
to the most exigent category. Again the same chick is not always in
the same category: if it catches cold or suffers from thirst or is badly
pecked by another chick or above all has a slight indigestion, caused
perhaps by eating a bad worm or too many ant cocoons, the chick will
fall from the first to the last rank.
When the alimentary category of a chick is known in time it is
always possible to make it live, if the place is hygienic. I mean by
this that when one gives a certain sort or quantity of food, one ought
to know the likely result on the chick's digestion four hours later.
This is very important as at the moment you notice you have made
a small mistake you have always four hours to undo it before the case
becomes desperate. But it is obviously impossible to discover this
without close observation. When it is a question of a new species,
it is necessary, for example, to examine the excrement of each chick
during several hours every day to discover which is the normal dropping
for each kind of food. It is easily understood that this work is not
possible with a large number of chicks. Complete success is not,
therefore, possible in the very rare species if every chick is not reared
individually. In fact large collections are bound to keep to the system
of broods with unavoidable losses.
Conclusions
If the O.P.S. wish to prevent the extinction of rare species there
are two roads to follow :--
(1) To favour the acquisition by specialists in rearing, of fertile
eggs, fresh or incubated, or freshly hatched chicks or imported pairs
of confirmed free breeders.
(2) Or combine the efforts of these specialists with those of the
amateur who has the good fortune to possess such birds.

By J. Delacour
I had not been in North America since 1927. In those days there
were very good public collections of live birds in different zoos, but
only a very few private ones and some commercial breeding establish-
ments. We all know that, since then, aviculture has spread considerably
over there, particularly in California, and the tremendous change in
the state of things which I have witnessed during my last trip is,
I think, well worth recording in our pages.
In America, aviculturists are up against a general difficulty;
labour is extremely difficult to find, and very expensive, so that, unless
one has large means, one must be prepared more or less to look after one's
birds oneself. That, of course, bars very large collections in most cases.
Another drawback is the hard climate of many parts of the country.
The whole North, North-East, and Middle-West have six months of very
cold weather which practically no birds from a warm or temperate
climate can stand without artificial heat, and the summers, being
oppressively hot, are also dangerous to some, although they suit others
very well. But it all means substantial and costly buildings. The
Southern states, on the other hand, mild in the winter, very hot and
damp in the summer, are good for tropical species, and the Pacific
coast, with climates varying from that of South-West England to
that of the Biviera, is extremely favourable to bird keeping and breeding
in general.
I. The East
The autumn is the best season in North-East America, and I arrived
in New York on 6th October, with M. Francis Edmond-Blanc. We
took over some rare birds of different sorts which I presented to some
of the zoos, and others which I had acquired from them, all having
travelled in perfect condition. Many friends met us at the wharf and
Mr. P. M. Maresi took us straight to his charming house at Scardale,
a pretty and country-like suburb. A Vice-President of the Avicultural
Society of America, Mr. Maresi has the best private collection of delicate
birds east of the Rockies at the present time. Although he keeps

some Pheasants and other Game birds, he is mostly interested in the
rarer insectivorous and frugivorous species. In his garden, there are
two large pergola-like aviaries, containing mixed collections, mostly
of seed-eaters and native American birds ; a series of pens for Pheasants
and other large birds, and an excellent bird-room, including three
large indoor compartments, connected with outdoor flights, to which
birds have access in good weather. A corridor runs in front of the
indoor flights, and on the other side excellent fixed cages cover the
whole wall. The room is well lighted and heated, painted with white
enamel, and perfectly kept. Mr. Maresi's collection contains several
hundreds of birds, and many unusual ones ; there are different Rock-
Thrushes, a curious Glass-eyed Thrush ( Turdus jamaicensis), a lovely
Fauny's Tanager (Calospiza nigrocincta), several Cuban Solitaires
(.Myiadestes elisabethse) , Western Bluebirds, Maroon Orioles, a fine Cock
of the Rock, many other species of Tanagers, Starlings, Barbets,
Finches, etc. I cannot give here a complete list of all the fine things
that I saw there and elsewhere : our Editor would be frightened of
the room it takes ! And I am frightened of her.
The next day we went to the Bronx Zoo, where it is always a joy
to meet Mr. Lee Crandall, the very capable and kind Curator of Birds.
The Bronx Zoo is exactly to-day what it was ten years ago, and the
bird-house is typical of those that one sees in public gardens all through
America. There is a large hall with big compartments right round,
and a great flight in the middle. Two smaller rooms adjoin it,
also with aviaries all round, some of which have outdoor flights as
well. The roofs are mostly of glass ; palms and bamboos in tubs here
and there. The collection in the house is very fine, the best of the
kind in America, and quite comparable to that of the London Zoo as
far as Passerine and Picarine birds go. There are no fewer than fifteen
species of Birds of Paradise, some very rare Hornbills, including the
fine Berenicornis comatus, Sunbirds and Humming-birds, different
Cotingas ; the Pompadour and a pair of pretty green Euchlornis
auripectus ; a very rare Caique ( Zarhynchus wagleri), many unusual
Toucans, Fruit-Pigeons, several rare Tanagers, including Compsocoma
sumptuosa, Thraupis olivicyanea, etc. Very tame and performing
Greater Bird of Paradise and Cock-of-Rock are of special interest.

The caretaker of this fine house has been for many years Mr. Stassey,
who worked first at the London Zoo and, no doubt, one of the keenest
and most capable bird-keepers I know.
I am glad to say that the Bronx Zoo authorities contemplate adding
a new bird-house with large indoor and outdoor aviaries in the near
future.
There is a good collection of Pheasants, and also of other Game birds;
a pair of the curious '' Stone " Curassows, or Pauxis, must be mentioned.
Parrots and Pigeons are numerous, some of them very rare. Waterfowl
are rather poor, but there are good Waders. During the winter, most
have to be kept in large indoor cages, and there are several big houses
for that purpose.
On account of the climate few of the smaller birds are reared in
captivity in the East, but there are a number of private breeders of
Game-birds and Waterfowl. Thanks to Mr. Maresi's kindness I visited
the most important and successful farms. Almost all of them are semi- or
completely commercial. Many are situated in New England, the very
picturesque and beautiful country which extends from north-east of
New York City to the Canadian border. In October, the densely wooded
hills and valleys are bright with autumnal colours, gold, pink, and
scarlet, such as we never see in Europe, and can compare with those of
Japan. We motored long distances along fine roads, passing through
pretty towns and villages, the white-painted wooden houses looking
" colonial " and so pretty under the drooping branches of large
American elms and maples which grow everywhere.
In the north of Massachussets, near Great Barrington, we saw the
game farm of Mr. F. Yessler, who breeds successfully most species of
hardy Pheasants, including Mikados and Edwards. All do well in this
cold climate, and we saw many young birds. Mr. Yessler is now using
exclusively electric brooders for his chicks, and so avoids all contagion
from broody hens. But all his eggs are incubated under hens, so that
he does almost exactly the reverse of many other breeders. He declares
that, in this way, he never fails to rear a healthily born chick.
Mr. Yessler's pheasantry for adult birds consists of two adjoining
rows of pens, of moderate size (10 to 15 by 20 to 30 feet), with an open
shelter running along one of the narrow sides, the whole lot forming

a rectangular ensemble, which is made rat-proof. The deep snow of
the winter does not trouble the birds.
Not far from New Haven, Connecticut, Mr. C. S. Sibley possesses
a large bird farm near Wallingford. Although one sees there a large
number of Pheasants and Waterfowl, many of his birds are reared at
different other farms in New England, particularly Ducks, where
warm springs and extensive waters make things easier. Mr. Sibley pos-
sesses most species of Pheasants, including the rarest, such as Mikados,
Tragopans, and Imperials, and even some of the more tender ones,
which live during the winter in heated shelters. His collection of
Waterfowl is the best in America, and includes practically all the North
American species and many of the others. He is successful in rearing
them each year. At Wallingford, the Swans, Ducks, and G-eese are
kept in several large enclosures, through which a shallow but wide
stream runs. His Pheasants have rather small pens, scattered all over
the slopes of an orchard.
Mr. Sibley is a keen and enthusiastic bird-lover and does much to
popularize bird-keeping in his country. I was his guest for two days
and had many interesting talks with him.
In the same district, Mr. P. Plant owns, at Waterford, a very good
collection of Pheasants, and also Bantams of many breeds. Mr. Plant
is a newcomer to aviculture, but has already gathered an almost complete
series. His pens run along two sides of a large meadow, forming an
L-shaped pheasantry ; they are good sized, with substantial open
shelters at the back; others, with heated shelters, have been built
in the vicinity for Polyplectrons, Firebacks, and Argus. Mr. Plant is
the president of the American O.P.S., and has altogether the
opportunities and the enthusiasm to make his hobby a great success.
On Long Island, we saw one day the astonishing farm of Mr. Tinker,
a well-known cinema producer, so we were told. It is supposed to be
an entirely commercial undertaking. There are rows of good Pheasant
pens, with the more ordinary species and a few rarer ones. But the
particular asset there is the numerous Eing-necked, Beeves', Golden,
and Amherst's Pheasants, which are reared annually, along with
Turkeys, Fowls, Ducks, and Geese, and sold to the market for food.
The farm covers many acres.

There are also on Long Island two interesting establishments :
the American branch of the well-known German firm, Louis Ruhe,
where many rare animals and larger birds are kept in pens and
heated stables (the smaller birds are in shops in New York City),
and Mr. Frank Buck's Zoological Park. Mr. Buck's name, of " Bring
them back alive " fame, is popular all over the world. But before
becoming a cinema star, he had been for many years a most skilful
and successful collector and importer of animals and birds. Many
of the rare specimens which have adorned American zoos during the
last thirty years have been " brought alive " by him. But Mr. Frank
Buck's recent Holy wood fame has not spoiled him ; he is just as affable,
kind, and unassuming a person as can be found anywhere. He has
recently acquired a large wooded tract of land and converted it into
a show place for animals and birds. Installations are simple, but
excellent. Besides a wonderful collection of large mammals, there are
very good Pheasants, Waders, and Waterfowl, and also nice small
birds. Many of the specimens are for sale, so that the collection is
continually being renewed.
There is a small zoo in the heart of the city of New York, in
Central Park. It has been recently rebuilt in the most attractive way.
There are only a few birds, kept in a large house, but the mammal
collection is good and well shown.
In different parts of the town one finds bird shops. That of Louis
Ruhe is the largest and the best. They sell mostly birds from Europe,
India, Abyssinia, etc., but also some from Central America,
Venezuela, and Colombia, which rarely come to us nowadays.
Otherwise there is usually less choice than in our European shores,
and prices are higher as a rule.
There is no proper zoo in Boston, but in one of the suburban parks,
a very fine bird-house, of Japanese style, has been recently erected, as
well as a large outdoor flight. There are a few interesting birds, but
many more common ones.
The Philadelphia Zoo, the oldest in America, shows signs of age,
and is soon to be rebuilt. The big bird-house, of the usual type, contains
some very good birds, including Birds of Paradise.

a fine collection. There is a very good series of Pheasants, some Water-
fowl, Parrakeets, and small birds. Several cages and aviaries, in the
pretty winter garden adjoining the house, are inhabited by Australian
and other Finches, Mynahs, Cissas, Orioles, and several other interesting
species. In the extensive grounds, one sees also a beautiful and large
kennel and many pens for Bantams and domestic Pigeons. Mrs. Smith's
collection is one of the best private ones in the country.
A few miles out of Washington, at Rockville, Maryland, Mr. C.
Denley owns the oldest and one of the finest collections of Pheasants
in America. His name, experience, and kindness are known the world
over to Game-bird amateurs. The climate of Maryland is not so severe
in the winter as that of New England, although still considerably
colder than that of England and Northern France. But summers are
extremely hot, so that precautions must be taken to keep the mountain
species as cool as possible. However, Mr. Denley has been for many
years very successful in breeding practically all sorts of Pheasants,
including Argus and Tragopans. His pheasantry covers a large piece
of ground, and there are many dozens of pens, some being heated
during the cold season. I noticed two curious cock hybrid Tragopans
(Satyr X Blyth's) with bright green faces quite intermediate between
the yellow of the Blyth's and the blue of the Satyr.
Between Philadelphia and Washington, Mr. W. J. Mackensen's
farm, at Yardley, is also interesting. There, several species of
Pheasants, including Mikados, and of Waterfowl, are reared
every year.
The Washington Zoo is situated in a beautifully hilly and wooded
park, very picturesque. Ten years ago it contained much of interest,
but the different installations were old and sometimes inadequate.
To-day, it is quickly becoming one of the best equipped zoos in the
world. A large and fine reptile house has been erected, while marvellous
buildings for large mammals (Elephants, Hippos, Rhinos, and Cattle)
and a beautiful small mammal house are almost ready to be opened.
The new bird house is very large and good ; it includes several long
galleries, luxuriously fitted, and a very fine central flying cage. The
largest gallery consists of a wide central space for the public with
aviaries all round, separated by plate glass, a process far superior to

tlie old-fashioned wire-netting partitions. Contrary to some expectations,
birds do not bang and hurt themselves against the glass.
There are also many excellent out-of-door aviaries and pens. I
particularly admired a pair of the rare Flightless Cormorants from the
Galapagos Islands, which nested last year. Also the three old
Californian Condors look as fine as ever. It is impossible to mention
here more species, but, on the whole, the collection of birds is very
good and increases continually. I noticed two curious and gorgeous
hybrid Amherst's X Reeves' Pheasants, bred and presented by
Mr. Denley. On the wonderful improvements which are being made
to the Washington Zoo we must congratulate its enterprizing, learned,
and genuine director, my friend Dr. W. Mann. The Washington Zoo
is the only one in the U.S.A. which belongs to the Federal Government.
All the others are either the property of cities, or of private societies
helped by municipalities.
During the month that I spent in the East, much of
my time was spent visiting museums, attending meetings, and
also watching wild birds in the field ; therefore, I could only visit
the best zoos, private collections, and bird farms. There are many
more of interest, however. Practically every city possesses one or
several zoos, or at least some bird collection in a public park, and there
are many breeders, mostly of Game-birds, all over the country.
II. The Middle West
My first visit, after leaving New York, was for Toronto. The Zoo of
this pretty Canadian city, ably managed by Dr. Y. A. Campbell is small,
but nicely situated, and includes many animals and birds of interest.
There are large outdoor aviaries, several ponds, and lakes in different
public parks are well stocked with waterfowl, mostly native. There are
only a few small birds. I noticed a Weka Rail and a rare Curassow
(Mitua tomentosa).
The new Detroit Zoo is quite far from the centre of the city ; it
is a large tract of land, and one of the prettiest zoos I have ever seen.
People who have seen the new Vincennes Zoo, in Paris, will have a
fair idea of the Detroit Zoo when I say that it is built on the same
plan, but ten times larger as far the open runs go. The shelters, under

rocks, are small and rough, and not open to the public. The general
effect, outside, is very pleasing. The gardens are beautifully kept,
and I was surprised to see lovely lawns in most of the pens. There is
no attempt at keeping a general collection, only groups of animals
and birds, according to geographical distribution, with some very rare
specimens. The only old-fashioned building in the Zoo is a bird house,
like those one sees everywhere in America ; but the collection includes
no rarities.
The new Brookfield Zoo at Chicago is one of the sights of America,
although it is not quite finished yet, and will still be greatly improved
during the next few years. The same enthusiastic promoters, whose
skill and generosity are already responsible for the great Field Museum
of Natural History and the marvellous Shedd Aquarium, have started it.
The grounds are very extensive and the means of developing them
adequate. No doubt within a few years it will be the largest
establishment of its kind in the world. Most of the accommodation
is of the modem " fenceless " style, but there are also quite a number
of luxurious houses for the smaller mammals and birds.
The Brookfield Zoo is very ably managed by Mr. E. H. Bean,
assisted by his son for the mammals (of which there is already a beauti-
ful collection). As the curator of birds, the Chicago Zoological Society
has had the luck to obtain the services of Mr. Karl Plath, whose name
is already familiar to our readers. Mr. Plath has been for many years
a private amateur and has successfully kept many of the rarest and
most difficult birds ; his pictures have also been much admired. His
knowledge and experience have seldom been surpassed. At the new
Chicago Zoo, Mr. Plath has a great opportunity for collecting and study-
ing birds in a big way, and he takes every opportunity of making the
collection one of the finest. He has at his disposal a large Small Bird
House, a Parrot House, another one for larger species, extremely
decorative and practical, and many pens and aviaries ; other accom-
modation will soon be added. Just to mention a few birds,
I will say that there are several Birds of Paradise,
including one Sickle-bill, a large selection of rare insectivorous
and frugivorous birds from all parts of the world, a very good series
of Western and Middle-Western American birds, including the most

difficult American Warblers, other insectivorous species, nearly all
the Australian Finches and Parrots, Humming Birds, etc. Some hand-
reared American Avocets and Stilts attracted my attention, as well as
a Wattled Crane and an Albatross, which has been over two years in
captivity. I hope that Mr. Plath will give us from time to time news of
the great collection under his care.
The old municipal Zoo of Chicago, in Lincoln Park, is still being
kept and even improved. Some of the houses are fine and there are
many good mammals ; but the collection of birds is rather indifferent.
There are hardly any private collections in this part of America,
but the very interesting Kellog Bird Sanctuary, in Michigan, and several
game-bird farms would have been well worth a visit; unfortunately,
I had not the time for it. Zoos, of various sizes and merits, are to be
found in most Middle-Western cities, and I much regret not to have
seen, particularly, those at Milwaukee, Toledo, Cincinnati, etc. But
I was luckily able to visit the wonderful St. Louis Zoo, probably the
best all round to-day in America. It is a municipal zoo ; all the accom-
modation has been renewed lately and much is still being done. The
situation of the park is very favourable, as the grounds are hilly, with
good trees and water, and close to the centre of the town. Like Chicago,
there are very fine houses as well as fenceless pens and rocky dens for
the larger mammals. At St. Louis the rock work is particularly elaborate
and good, and it imitates perfectly different natural formations of the
neighbourhood. There is a very fair collection of waterfowl on the
lake--a rare feature in American zoos, where horrible domestic ducks
and geese usually disfigure the ponds. As to the Bird House, it is the
prettiest that I have ever seen so far. A very nice construction of
Spanish style, it has a unique feature : a central patio, under a glass
roof, laid out and planted as a tropical garden, the front of which
is truly fenceless, so that the small Waders, Doves, and other birds
which live there can, if they choose, fly right round the gallery, where
the public walk. But they hardly ever do so, as the gallery is rather
dark. In the centre, on both sides of the patio, and at the back, are
several large planted aviaries, stocked with rare Starlings, Shrikes,
Fairy Bluebirds, Pittas, Finches, Sunbirds, Sugarbirds, Tanagers, etc.
One very roomy and high compartment is the home of three magnificent

J, B. Housden--Where the Bahamas Bide 55
male Cocks of the Rock, who have lived there over three years ; it is
a wonderful sight to watch them jump and fly among the limbs of a
large banyan tree, and catch on the wing the grapes that their keeper
throws up in the air. To my amazement they never fight seriously.
Right round the public gallery, on the outer sides, are many compart-
ments of various sizes, where an excellent collection is kept. On the
southern side there is a large planted aviary for Humming Birds. All
the compartments are separated from the public by plate glass. A long
corridor, with aviaries on both sides, some corresponding to outdoor
pens, is used for larger birds. There is also a huge and beautiful flying
cage. The St. Louis Zoo is very ably managed by Mr. G. Vireheller,
who is helped in his task by an enthusiastic amateur, Mr. E. A. Lemp,
whose country estate, 50 miles from St. Louis, contains many mammals,
living in semi-liberty, as well as birds. I regretted that I was
unable to visit it. Both Mr. Vireheller and Mr. Lemp showed me
round their Zoo and entertained me in the most cordial way. I went
to St. Louis and back by air from Chicago in one day.

I want to suggest to any member of our Society if at any time they
should find themselves in New York City, and have the time, they
should pay a visit to the American Museum of Natural History,
77th Street and Central Park, West.
I have been there several times. On one occasion (on my way to
Southern Texas) I stayed with friends at Staten Island, N.Y., a
fortnight. Most days I found myself either at the Museum or the
Zoological Park ; a very pleasant steam-boat ride and view of New
York City and harbour, across the Hudson River.
Staten Island is very interesting in bird and bird life ; I found
there the first pair of American Robins nesting.
* Two cases of birds in the Natural History Museum are very
interesting, the one a large case of the extinct Passenger Pigeon
(Ectopistes migralorius). " Audubon the naturalist wrote of these

pigeons which in 1805 were so numerous that he saw schooners at the
wharves in New York City loaded in bulk with these pigeons, which
were sold at the rate of a few cents per dozen."
The last Passenger Pigeon died in the Cincinnati Zoological Gardens
in 1914.
The other case, " A Flamingo Colony in the Bahamas, West
Indies" is one of the largest and most interesting groups of birds I have
ever seen.
Near the case are pamphlets, " For the Visitor to Take Away,"

Before the studies for this group were made, very little was known
about the nesting habits of Flamingoes. For this reason, and because
of the belief that a reproduction of a Flamingo city (beyond question
the most remarkable sight in the world of birds) would possess excep-
tional interest, an expedition was dispatched to the Bahamas in 1902,
to find Flamingoes on their grounds. It was unsuccessful; but in 1904
the search was resumed, and on this occasion the birds were discovered,
and from an artificial blind, concealed in the very heart of their rookery,
containing 2,000 birds, a series of unique photographs and observations
were made.
The birds began to lay their eggs in May. Their nests are constructed
by scooping up mud with the bill and patting it down with bill and feet.
The nests are raised to a height of from 8 to 14 inches to protect their
contents from a subsequent rise in the water.
Both sexes incubate, one by day the other by night. The young
are hatched covered with down like young ducks. They remain in
the nest three or four days, and during this period are fed by the
parents on predigested juices of a mollusk of the genus Cerithium. They
also eat the shell of the egg from which they have so recently emerged.
The singular shape of the bill of the adult Flamingo is related to
the manner in which it secures the small spiral Cerithium shells, which,
in the Bahamas, appear to constitute its only food. To obtain them
the bill is pressed into the soft mud until its point turns upwards.
The lower mandible moves rapidly, forcing out the mud and water
through the channels along the sides of the bill and leaving the shells.
The bill of the young Flamingo is essentially straight, but when

about two weeks old the curve becomes evident, and the young bird
begins to feed as does its parent.
When a month old, a second downy plumage is acquired, and at
the age of two months, this is replaced by a dress of brownish feathers.
In October or November this is probably followed by the pink plumage
of maturity, since no brown birds are seen in the spring.

By Miss J. M. Grant-Ives
Readers of the Avicultural Magazine will know that Monsieur
Delacour is back in Europe. I think one of his first actions on his
arrival in London was to write to me asking that a Committee Meeting
should be summoned as he was anxious to meet its members, several
of whom he did not know. He has, moreover, some important matters
to lay before us. This meeting will have taken place at York on
13th March. We are so pleased to know that M. Delacour intends to
take such an active interest in our Society and we feel proud to think
this interest will be of a practical nature.
One outstanding feature of the Pheasant fancy in Great Britain
has become very emphasized in recent months, and this is due to the
Palace Show.
Many Phasianists of financial standing have recently purchased
many of the rare and even delicate species of Pheasants. This has
been a most pleasing feature of our progress. The O.P.S. is most anxious
so see an increase in Great Britain of many of the rarer species, for
we know that if these are not bred in captivity there is a great danger
of them becoming extinct, this fact M. Delacour has more than once
emphasized in the Avicultural Magazine.
In other countries, especially in parts of the Continent and America,
Pheasant lovers have for many years striven successfully to breed
them, and it must be admitted that up to very recent times Britishers
have lagged behind. I should like to mention a few fanciers on the
Continent who have done much for this grand cause.

First and I say foremost we have Monsieur Delacour and his
" Directeur ", Mr. F. E. Fooks. Then there are M. Malisoux and Dr.
Derscheid, of Belgium. Again Herr Stefani, of Germany. These
gentlemen all deserve our thanks. But now we Britishers are going to
bestir ourselves. Blue Crossoptilons also Brown of the same ilk,
Bronze-tailed Peacock Pheasants, Impeyans, Tragopans, Edwards,
and other rare Pheasants are all in great demand. This must have
happy results for many of these pairs will produce chicks as they are
in the hands of capable and worthy owners. The O.P.S. does not
discourage the propagation of the commoner species, but many of
these are now safe for all time. This Society will not have fulfilled its
raison d&apos;etre until great numbers of the rare species are also safe for
posterity.
Success begets success and our Society is progressing rapidly.
The O.P.S. was only formed in July, 1935, and we already have very
nearly 300 members. We only wish more bird lovers who are members
of the Avicultural Society would also join our Society. Subscriptions
are only Qs. per annual, and my address is :--\0x25A0

Madam, --When I read Mr. Porter's articles on the bird shops of the
East I felt so strongly--Why do not the aviculturists in England arrange
somehow or other to have many of these birds shipped to England for
the benefit of so many who would rejoice so to have them and would keep
them under proper conditions. It seems such a waste, and as these rare
and beautiful birds die for lack of the correct treatment, surely among so
many keen aviculturists something could be done to get in touch with the
catchers and have some of the lovely birds shipped direct to this country
under the care of an experienced man. Such birds as Bustards and Cranes
would be a wonderful addition to large gardens and enclosures. Do you not
think--if everyone would help--it would become a reality?
I do not want to bother you in any way--but felt I simply must tell
you--as the idea always comes so strongly when I read these accounts--

It seems such a pity not to divert part at least of the stream of bird life

Madam, --I notice in the recent Ornamental Pheasant Society's Magazine
they put forward an excellent suggestion of suitable note heading for members.
This shows what to my idea is a very handsome little coloured picture of
a Golden Pheasant in the top corner and the paper suitably engraved and
addressed.
Might I respectfully make the suggestion that such an idea would be
welcomed by our own members, not only as an ornamental and suitable type
of notepaper for general " members' bird correspondence ", but it would
also be a means of indicating when writing to strangers that one is a Member
of the Avicultural Society without adding the words after one's signature,
which in my opinion always looks a little ostentatious.
I do feel that the Ornamental Pheasant Society have hit upon a particu-
larly attractive idea both from a convenient and financial point of view for

THE RUFFED OR SOLITARY LORY
(Phigys solitarius)
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.9873162" page_id="56321961"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
In 1911 Dr. Philip H. Bahr (now Dr. Manson Bahr), brought from
Fiji a collection of birds, amongst which was a pair of Buffed or Solitary
Lories, beautiful birds with gay dress of brilliant red and green and
an Elizabethan Buff. These were deposited in the London Zoological
Gardens, and were the first of their kind to be exhibited there ; but
it appears that they were not the first to reach this country. In the
Magazine for November, 1912, was published a letter from Captain
T. K. Hudson, showing that he had succeeded in bringing a pair of
these birds to England some forty years previously.
Dr. Bahr's account of Phigys ( Calliptilus) solitarius, published in
our Magazine for December, 1911, is very interesting and since, doubt-
less, the majority of present-day members have not access to the
volumes of a quarter of a century ago, we cannot do better than quote
from it:--
" The Fijian Lory, the 4 Kula ' of the natives and, no doubt, mis-
named solitarius because it is always seen in pairs and never singly,
flying and screaming about the coco-nut palms.
44 It is extremely abundant in some of the smaller islands, notably
Kadavu and Taveuni. Possessed of the most magnificent plumage
of scarlet and green ... it has every quality of becoming a charming pet.

" One of the planters (in Taveuni) is an ardent aviculturist and
knew of a number of nesting-holes of this species. He had, however,
not had much success himself with this species in captivity. These
holes were situated low down in dead stumps which had been left in
his coco-nut plantation. The site was, in the majority of cases, on a
level with the ground, thus explaining, in all probability, the ease
with which the Kula becomes wiped out by the Mongoose in other
localities."
After describing the difficulties of obtaining young birds and in
rearing them, Dr. Bahr tells of the troubles of the long voyage home
and of his arrival with three specimens, one of which survived but a
short time. He continues :--
" The two survivors have now assumed magnificent adult plumage
with an outstanding ruff of red and green. Their beaks, which at first
were brown, became bright yellow when three months of age. In
May they underwent a partial moult of the head and breast feathers,
and a complete moult in August (i.e. when eight months old). All
summer they have been kept in a large cage in the house, and on
warm days in the open.
" They feed now almost exclusively on porridge, though they are
very partial to fruit, especially grapes, apples, and cherries. They
partake of a warm bath daily and are extremely lively. During the
older weather they require to be placed in a warm cupboard at night.
They are indeed fascinating pets and would doubtless become very
popular could they be successfully transported to this country."

By J. Delacour
III. California
On 14th November I left Chicago at 6.30 a.m. by air, and before
7.30 p.m. I was at the Sacramento Aerodrome, a journey which takes
over three days by train. Mr. W. Leland Smith was waiting for me,
and took me to his home at Fair Oaks.
Most of the Californian Pheasant-breeders live in the Sacramento-
San Francisco region. In the Sacramento Valley, climatic conditions
are similar to those in the South of France : a mild winter, but often
damp and sometimes as cold as 15*, and a very hot, dry summer.
They seem to suit all sorts of Pheasants, as well as Pigeons and Doves.
Mr. Leland Smith has an orange and flower ranch as well as an im-
portant bird-farm. He breeds Game birds in large numbers, all sorts
of Pheasants--American Quails, Chukor Partridges, many species
of wild Pigeons and Doves, including Crowned and Victoria's Gouras,
and a few small birds, Parrots, and Waterfowl. He has well over a
hundred aviaries, most of them very roomy and without artificial
shelters, but shaded by century-old evergreen oaks. The soil is sandy.
Like most Pheasant breeders in California, oats, barley, afalfa, etc.,
are sown and grown inside the aviaries during the winter to provide
green food. Fruit is always plentiful and cheap in California.
Mr. Smith owns the finest collection of Pheasants in America,
where nearly all the rarer species are represented, the gems of which
are several pairs of the White Eared-Pheasant and a pair of Chinese

Monauls. He also possesses and breeds Koklass, Bheinartes, Argus,
Palawan and Bronze-tailed Polyplectron ; and I saw there a pair of
the rare Tetroaphasis thibetanus , a large Partridge from the high
mountains of Western China. The different species of Firebacks do
extremely well at Fair Oaks, and breed freely. Although Mr. Smith is
endeavouring to make his collection pay through breeding, he is a
most genuine and enthusiastic bird lover. I greatly enjoyed the few
days I spent in his hospitable ranch.
My host drove me about the district for several days, and we visited
together a number of interesting Came farms, without speaking of such
wonderful mountain scenery as Lake Tahoe. We saw, particularly, the
California State Game Farm at Napa, where thousands of Bing-necks
and Mongolian Pheasants, Quails, Chukors, some Amhersts, Goldens,
and Beeve's, and Mexican Wild Turkeys are reared annually. Excellent
results are obtained with electric incubators and brooders, the latter
placed in houses connected to small outdoor pens with cement floors
covered with a couple of inches of sand. Mr. Bade, the superintendent,
was most hospitable, and gave me very useful information. We
also visited the aviaries of Mr. J. W. Steinbeck, who has a nice
selection of rare Pheasants and Doves at Stockton ; those of Mr. H. F.
Kangieser, at Menlo Park, where there are some good Pheasants and
excellent Doves, including many Mountain Witches and Kubary's
Ground Pigeons, and some interesting Phabitreron from the Philippine
Islands, among others, as well as hybrids, Gallicolumba hubaryi X
G. rubescens. We also arrived just in time to see the aviaries,
numerous and extensive, and a few remnants of the Pheasant collection
of Mr. W. J. Jackson, who has just given up his hobby, a great pity
as he was most successful in breeding several rare species, including
Satyr, Temminck's and Cabot's Tragopans, Imperial, Edward's, and
Mikado Pheasants, different Polyplectrons, Java, and Sonnerat's
Junglefowl.
We paid a visit to Mr. S. H. Levin, who also was selling out his
large collection of Pheasants, Parrakeets, Pigeons, Waders, and small
birds. There were a dozen Victoria Crowned Pigeons, most of them
bred on the spot, as well as several Blue Porphyrios, a mixture of
the African, Indian, and Australian species. There were over 100

Peafowl, Blue, White, Black-winged, and Specifer, which are most
prolific in California, even the last named, and are bred all over this
State in numbers, as well as hybrids, which are quite popular.
In the different suburbs of San Francisco one finds many bird
stores. Mr. Mori, a Japanese dealer, usually offers a good selection of
Japanese and Filipino birds, from Cranes to Finches, as well as
Australian and sometimes Indian species. He is now the first importer
on the Pacific Coast. The best shops are on the eastern side of the bay,
near Oakland, some quite far from the centre. These Californian bird-
stores look very nice and different from what we have on this side of
the Atlantic. They consist of a house, usually new and nicely built,
on the road, with the shop in front; at the back there is an extensive
piece of ground where rows of aviaries have been built, usually
very neatly. Canaries, Parrots, and some show birds are kept in
the shop, as well as cages, food, etc.; but the largest number of
birds, including Peacocks, Pheasants, Doves, Parrakeets, etc., live,
and often breed, in outdoor aviaries. The whole arrangement is
far cleaner and more attractive than what we see in the usual
European bird-shops. The best that I have visited are those of Messrs.
Thierry, Poisal, and Julius, the two first of French origin, while
Mr. Brock, a native of Scotland, has several town shops and is very
clever with difficult insectivorous birds. He helped me greatly in the
packing and care of the birds I brought over.
Since a few years, the city of San Francisco has a zoo, situated on
the ocean shore. From the name of its principal supporter it is known
as the Fleishacker Zoo. The present accommodations are temporary
and simple, but quite good, and Carnivora particularly--lions, tigers,
black leopards, pumas, and jaguars are breeding regularly. There are
only a limited number of birds. But a large modern zoo is now being
built: what I have seen of the works and plans shows that it will
become a very fine modem establishment. It is supervised by Mr.
Edmund Heller, the well-known naturalist and explorer, who accom-
panied Theodore Roosevelt on his African trip.
The climate of San Francisco itself, and between the Bay and the
ocean, is very peculiar; practically even all the year round, never
very cold, never hot, with a lot of fog. It does not seem to be very

favourable to birds in general. But on tbe other side of the Bay, and
farther north and south, the temperature rises in the summer and
drops in the winter, being comparable, I think, to the south-west of
France. It suits Game birds perfectly.
In the San Francisco district there are many private aviaries,
and I visited a number of them. Many amateurs have from one to
twenty pens, with nice collections of small birds, Doves and Parrakeets,
also a few Quails and Pheasants. Some are more important and I
should mention a few.
Mr. C. C. Broadwater, a Vice-President of the Avicultural Society
of America, has a fine collection at Oakland. Several large and high
aviaries, adjoining the house, are the home of many Australian and
other Finches, which breed freely, and also Tanagers, etc. In another
part of the garden there are rows of aviaries, mostly for Parrakeets,
and among many rarities I noticed three young Pileated. There are
high shelters heated by electricity on a thermostat system, which seems
to be very satisfactory.
Mrs. H. S. Bonestell has also a very interesting collection in several
groups of aviaries, built on extensive grounds on the bank of a narrow,
wooded valley, where lots of wild birds, especially Californian Quail,
are very tame owing to protection. Tanygnathus and Eclectus Parrots
breed regularly with her. I noticed particularly excellent Cissas and
Fairy Bluebirds. Mrs. Bonestell is a great traveller in Eastern Asia
and the South Seas, and she has brought home many rare birds.
On the south side of San Francisco, at Los Altos, Mr. R. A. Isemberg,
whose name is well known in aviculture, has large aviaries where he
keeps and breeds many rare softbills, Touracous, etc. Unfortunately,
I was not able to visit him this time owing to sudden change in the
date of my sailing. He is now moving to a new and larger place.
For an Old World aviculturist, one collection is of very great interest,
that of Mr. Eric Kinsey, at Manor, in a cool and shady canyon of
Marin County, north of the Bay of San Francisco. Mr. Kinsey, the
present president of the Cooper Club, is an excellent ornithologist,
who knows as much of wild Californian birds as anyone on earth.
But, quite rightly, he believes that there is a great deal more to be
learned of the habits and behaviour of birds by keeping them in

captivity, under special conditions, and lie has been particularly
successful in this endeavour. He has a very large and high aviary,
thickly planted with trees and berry bushes, with a very roomy shelter ;
another good-sized aviary, half a dozen compartments, and a smaller
flight, with a good shelter, as well as a number of cages complete his
accommodations. I forgot to say that, so far, Mr. Kinsey has specialized
on Californian passerine birds, and keeps no others, except a few
Anna and Allen's Humming-birds. Of course, he can only do so by
enjoying a special scientific permit from the Federal Government
and the State of California, as most species of birds are strictly protected.
In Mr. Kinsey's aviaries one sees practically all species of local passerine
birds. I was thrilled to watch in captivity such rarities as Varied
Thrushes, Mountain and Western Bluebirds, Townsends' Solitaires,
American Flycatchers, Horned Larks, Pipits, Eock Wrens, Nuthatches,
Wren-Tits (Chamasa), Thrashers, Waxwings, Phainopeplas, several
species of American Warblers, including the beautiful " Long-tailed
Chat " (Icteria virens), a fine songster, Troupials, Western Tanagers,
different Grosbeaks and Buntings, Towdiees, and Sparrows. Later on,
I spent several days up country with Mr. Kinsey to trap some of the
birds that I was kindly allowed to take home with me, and I had a
very interesting experience, watching and catching such lovely species
as Western and Mountain Bluebirds, of which I'll say more later on.
Mr. Kinsey's enthusiasm and helpful kindness cannot be praised too
much, and it is thanks only to him that I have been able to take with
me an excellent collection of Californian birds, most of which had never
before reached Europe alive.
There used to be a wonderful collection of Waterfowl near San
Francisco, that of my late friend, Mr. de Laveaga. It was unfortunately
dispersed after his death, although it had been donated to the Whittier
Bird Club, a public institution situated near Los Angeles, which,
unfortunately, could not be maintained owing to financial difficulties.
Mr. N. B. Tucker had also built up an equally good one, at his duck-
shooting club on the south-east of the Bay. Unfortunately, Mr. Tucker
has just given it up, so that there are no more large Waterfowl collec-
tions in California. There are some, however, in Oregon, Washington,
and Utah, I hear, but I had no time to visit them.

California, however, has a great attraction for the Waterfowl
lover, as it is a paradise for wild Swans, Geese, and Ducks. Owing
to protection, many bays and marshes are full of Waterfowl, some of
them wonderfully tame. Even in towns, wild Ducks abound on orna-
mental waters, mostly Mallards, Pintails, Wigeons, Green-winged Teal,
Ruddy Ducks, Lesser and Ring-necked Scaup, and Canvas-backs.
In sheltered bays there are hundreds or thousands of Ducks of different
species: Pintails, Wigeons, Gadwall, Buffle-heads, Golden-eyes,
Ruddies, countless Surf-Scoters (which, on the wing, absurdly resemble
Hill-Mynahs, with their yellow and white patches !), Velvet Scoters,
Scaup, Reed-heads (scarce), and Black Brent. At sea there are some
Mergansers, and I saw a lovely pair of Harlequins; and I am not speaking
of the hordes of Waders, Cormorants, Loons, Gulls, etc. On waters
sheltered by trees one sees some Carolina Ducks. The only two Cali-
fornian species absent at that time of year, as they migrate south,
are the Fulvous Tree-duck and the Cinnamon Teal. But the finest
sight is that of hundreds of thousands of wild Geese in the Sacramento
Valley : I watched them for two days and must have seen about
300,000. The most numerous are the White-fronted, Lesser Snow or
Cackling and Hutchin's Geese ; there is only one flock of about 10,000
Ross's Snow Geese, all there is in the world, and a few Tule Geese or
Greater White-fronted (Anser albifrons gambelli). The large Canadian
Goose does not mix with the others, and is found in small groups on
higher ponds ; it is the only one that breeds in California. There
are, of course, lots of Ducks in the valley, and I saw also hundreds
of Whistling Swans and came across a big flock of Sandhill Cranes
(800 to 1,000), the largest seen since many years. I am indebted for
these most interesting trips to Mr. James Moffitt, the ornithologist of
the Academy of Natural Science in San Francisco, a keen field naturalist
and a great lover and specialist of Water-birds. I owe also to his kind-
ness the opportunity of taking home a Black Brent, a Ross's Snow,
and a Cackling Goose.
At Oakland I had the pleasure of meeting several times my old
friend Dr. E. W. Gifford, the well-known anthropologist, who keeps
a collection of rare Pigeons and Doves. While, ten years ago, he was

mostly interested in the different Ground Doves, he now specializes
and collects only species in which the sexes are different.
Between San Francisco and Los Angeles, one must see Mr. R.
Hearst's hacienda at San Simeon. It is the most astonishing place on
earth. It includes several hundreds of thousands of acres of beautiful
country: mountains and valleys, with the ocean shore to the west,
all practically wild and extremely picturesque. Unfortunately, this
fine scenery is somewhat spoiled by the huge house, an unfinished
structure which is supposed to represent a Spanish castle, but rather
reminds one of a glorified Monte-Carlo casino ! It is surrounded by
elaborate gardens, full of marble balustrades, steps, pavements,
statues, temples, etc., where some beautiful things stand among less
happy efforts. There are marvellous works of art inside the castle,
and three smaller guest houses. There, to come back to our subject,
one sees in huge enclosures all sorts of wild Cattle, Deer, Zebras and
Antelope, Ostriches, Rheas, Emus, and Cassowaries at liberty, and that
is well worth the visit. There is also a regular, if not very attractive,
menagerie with Tigers, Lions, Elephants, Giraffes, Monkeys, etc.
At a large poultry and game farm are a few fancy Pheasants,
Ducks, and Parrots ; but nothing of special interest. I hear that the
famous Mr. Hearst has spent millions on his ranch, and I well believe it;
what could not have been achieved by such means on such a
wonderful site !
With the exception of one week in San Francisco, when I returned
in mid-December, I was in Southern California from 26th November
till 12th January. During my visit the weather was mostly warm and
sunny, but there were cold nights, rainy, chilly days, and, for a few
days, hard frosts (18* at Pasadena). Of course, the climate changes
very much locally, some spots being always above freezing. On the
whole, the climate is very similar to that of the Riviera, hot and dry
during the summer, mild in the winter, which is the rainy season, with
occasional cold spells. As it is, it suits birds in general admirably,
particularly Australian and other Finches, Australian Parrakeets,
African Lovebirds, Conures, Cockatoos and other Parrots, Pigeons,
and Doves ; they all live well and breed freely in outdoor aviaries
with open shelters. I have no doubt that other exotic birds would do

just as well, after being acclimatized, from what I have seen at some
amateurs. But South Californian breeders' efforts have so far been
mostly directed toward the breeding of seed-eating birds. Large
numbers have been reared annually since a few years, and easily absorbed
locally. Numerous people have built aviaries in the Los Angeles
district, and surplus birds can be quickly disposed of. There are lots
of bird-shops and farms, some very large and well-fitted, with numerous
flights in their back gardens. The best are now " Flower's Tropical
Bird Farm ", " Bird Wonderland ", " Southern California Bird and Pet
Exchange They have a very good assortment of Budgerigars,
Canaries, Australian Finches, some African and Asiatic birds, many
Mexican birds, and also a few rarities of various origin, as well as
many Game birds, a few Waders, and Waterfowl. They usually have a
large flight-cage in front.
The prices of imported foreign birds are generally higher than
with us ; but Japanese, Filipino, and Australian birds are about
the same or cheaper. Mexican, Central American, Colombian, and
Venezuelan birds, rather cheap. Indian and, still more, African birds
are five or six times dearer than they are in Europe. Pheasants and
Waterfowl have more or less the same value. Among the smaller birds
bred in California, the rarer Parrakeets, Parrots, and Finches fetch
good prices ; but Lovebirds, Zebra, and other Common Finches are
very cheap, fetching about one-half of European prices only.
The Avicultural Society of America now have their headquarters
in Los Angeles, as it is the American city where the greatest number
of members live. It is also the seat of the California Game Breeders'
Association, and of the southern branch of the Cooper Ornithological
Club. These three societies most kindly entertained me at a dinner
attended by nearly a hundred ornithologists and aviculturists, whom
I was delighted to meet.
Nearly all South Californian aviaries are built of wood, with
substantial shelters, often as large as the flights themselves, but not
heated. There are no movable aviaries : they were found unnecessary
on account of the sandy soil and dry climate. They are usually disposed
in rows and blocks.
I have visited a number of aviculturists in or near Los Angeles,

Riverside, and San Diego, and, later on, I'll give some information
on the larger collections. But a few words in general on the birds one
sees almost everywhere may be useful. With the exception of the
Firetails and Painted Finches, all Australian species are numerous
and bred in large numbers. Gouldians do extremely well, and also
Diamond Sparrows. There are only a few Parrot Finches, and all
African Waxbills are rare, although they do well. Zebra Finches are
common and very cheap ; a silver and a white strain has been evolved.
White and grey Java Sparrows are widespread. Other seed-eaters are
scarcer than in Europe.
Doves of all sorts are more numerous than they are with us, and
do exceedingly well.
Quite a few Amazon and Grey Parrots, Ring-necks, and Conures
are bred each season, and also Eclectus and Tanygnathus, and Cockatoos.
Grass Parrakeets, Lorikeets, and Broadtails in general are reared in
numbers ; but there are very few King's, Crimson-wings, Blue-winged,
Turquoisine, Rock-Peplars, Barraband's, Bauer's, and Barnard's, and
no Stanley's, Many-coloured, Hooded, Blue-bonnets, Queen Alexandra,
nor Splendids. There are, on the other hand, a few odd Pyrrhulopsis and
a fair number of Norfolk Island and Pileated Parrakeets. Thousands
of Masked, Fischer's, Nyassa, Peach-faced, and Black-cheeked
Lovebirds are bred, as well as Budgerigars, and all have a low value.
I saw a few Madagascar and Abyssinian Lovebirds, and some of the
latter breed, although only on rare occasions.
As our members know well, it was Lord Tavistock's enterprise
that started Parrakeet breeding in California. The birds he sent several
years ago have produced many of the present inhabitants of the Los
Angeles aviaries. All aviculturists ought to be grateful to him for
such a happy initiative.
I stayed in South California with my friend, Marquess Hachisuka,
the well-known Japanese ornithologist, who has lived at Pasadena
and Los Angeles for the last eighteen months on account of his health,
which, I am glad to say, is now quite good again.
The largest private collection of birds in the district of Los Angeles
is perhaps that of Mr. W. J. Sheffler, a vice-president of the Aviculture
Society, who is also a keen ornithologist and egg collector. At his home

lie has a beautiful semi-circular aviary for small birds, consisting of a
central house with eight flights radiating from it. There he keeps all
sorts of Finches, Tanagers, and other small birds, and also some Road-
Runners, the curious desert Ground Cuckoos of the south-west. It is
one of the most varied mixed collections of birds that I have seen in
the district, and artistically shown. Large box-cages are the home of
some Tahitian Blue Lories, which nested last summer, but unfortunately
resented inquisition and forsook their eggs. Some miles away, but still
in Los Angeles City (one must not forget that the city limits include
many towns, oil-fields, marshes, waste grounds, and cultivated tracts,
its diameter being some 30 miles), Mr. Sheffler has built a large block
of aviaries, walled-in, with a central house. They consist of four rows
of flights, completed by a fifth row outside, and, in front, by a very
large and high flight cage, containing a pond for Waterfowl. He keeps
there several species of Tree-Ducks, Teal, and small Ducks, South
African Sheldrakes, Curassows, a few male Pheasants, lots of Cockatiels,
and Doves, Jays and Magpies. In the numerous compartments live
many different species of Parrakeets ; Mealy Rosellas and Pennant's
breed very freely, as well as different Cockatoos and Conures. I noticed
especially several Brown's, a pair of Norfolk Island's, Lugon
Tanygnathus, Mitchell's and Forsten's Lorikeets, and hybrids wdth
Swainson's. There are also quite a number of Jay Thrushes, Mexican
Jays, etc., and a fine pair of Harris Hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus),
various Pheasants and Quails.
Dr. R. A. Woods also possesses remarkable birds, mostly Parrakeets,
and has great success with King's, Bourke's, and other rare species,
as well as with Finches. I noticed several All-green Tanagers, out of
doors, in perfect condition, which is not often seen. Dr. Woods is also
a keen field ornithologist and oologist.
Other interesting collections of Finches, Parrots, and Parrakeets
are those of Mr. A. G. Orear, the editor of Aviculture ; Mrs. V.
Wright; Mrs. H. Scheu (who has blue and yellow Masked Lovebirds) ;
and Miss I. Maurois, to mention a few I have visited. Mr. C. Naether
has some excellent Doves, which he is studying very carefully.
Mrs. S. Tomlinson, who has given up most of her birds after her husband's
death, still has, in perfect condition after more than four years, her

wonderful male Anna Humming-bird, which lives in a large sheltered
aviary, built along the wall of the house, full of creepers and bushes.
Mr. S. Stevens, near Riverside, has a large and pretty aviary of two
compartments, where he keeps a fine mixed collection of seed- and
soft food-eating birds. I noticed there the finest Holden Oriole (the
Philippine race) that I ever saw, a delightfully tame Plumed Ground
Dove, and a lovely Tabuan Parrakeet.
Mr. and Mrs. R. Black have very large, wild aviaries, with many
Pheasants, Pigeons, Parrakeets, etc. For over ten years they have
bred the fine Otidiphaps nobilis , and they still have eight of them.
I noticed a gorgeous hybrid Borneo Fireback X Swinhoe Pheasant.
Mr. Black claims that they reared a hybrid between the Nicobar Pigeon
and the Otidiphaps, which, unfortunately, I could not see.
Mr. Howland, at the foot of his oil-wells, has a fine pheasantry,
with many rare species. Mr. J. R. Gorton, the president of the Game
Breeders 5 Association, has a good mixed collection. Mr. W. J. Parsonson,
a keen beginner, breeds Pheasants and the smaller Waterfowl.
Mr. Gilbert Lee has been successful in breeding Grey Parrots and
Eclectus for several years, and he has quite a breeding stock of them,
as well as of some other species of Parrots and Parrakeets. The gems
of his collection are a newly arrived and exquisite pair of Marquesan
Blue Lories ( Coriphilus smaragdinus), and a pair of Kuhl's Ruby
Lories. These have been nesting repeatedly for several years, but only
one young one was so far reared, all the others dying after a couple
of days. Mr. Lee is now trying a new and more insectile diet, which
they probably require.
Dr. Leon Patrick, at Orange, is one of the first and most successful
Parrot breeders in California, and many of Lord Tavistock's birds
have been entrusted to him. He has a choice collection, including
several pairs of Norfolk Island, Pileated, and Derbyan Parrakeets.
He has just bred a hybrid Panama X Levaillant's Amazon.
In the vicinity of San Diego, a very warm district, we visited what
is perhaps the largest private collection of Parrots in America, that of
Mr. I. D. Putnam. He has some 150 large outdoor compartments,
built along walls in two rows facing one another, with a large space
between them. Mr. Putnam owns many pairs of different species of

Australian Parrakeets, including Brown's and Pileated, of Conures,
Lories, Macaws, and Cockatoos, and a few others. There is a beautiful
tame Masked Parrakeet from Fiji, hybrid Edward's X Blue Mountain
Lories, and also a few Game birds, among them some Masked Bob-
whites (Colinus ridgwayi ), from Texas, a rare species.
Farther away from the city, on a picturesque and rugged hill,
Mrs. E. M. Bobinson, an artist and animal lover, who lived many years
in France, has large and fine aviaries inhabited by Tragopans, other rare
Pheasants, and various birds.
In the San Fernando Valley, near Fillmore, two of the best
Californian collections can be seen. Mr. F. H. Budkin, who left England
some twenty years ago, possesses a number of aviaries, some of them
very roomy and high, and planted with tall orange and other trees.
He keeps a beautiful selection of Parrakeets, Finches, and other birds,
and he breeds them most successfully ; for instance, I saw over fifty
young Gouldians. There are, among other rarities, several Pileated
Parrakeets and blue Masked Lovebirds, the latter produced suddenly
by his normally coloured birds during the last breeding season. Mr.
Budkin loves his birds, which are all tame and seem to know
him well.
&apos;Not far from Mr. Budkin's ranch, Mr. and Mrs. Keith Spalding
own a unique collection on their large estate of " Bancho Sespe ".
Nearly all the aviaries I have been mentioning in South California
are situated in towns or their suburbs, in small gardens, and, therefore,
form very compact blocks. At Bancho Sespe, in the open country,
they have been built on a larger scale, and remind one, more than
others, of those of our European parks. There is, not far from the house,
an enclosure with many pens and aviaries. A delightful little herd of
exceedingly tame little Beeve's Muntjacs, as well as many Game birds,
run round the pens and beg for food in a very amusing way. In the
pens live rare Pheasants and Peacocks, Curassows, Cranes, etc., as well
as many small birds, Doves, and Parrakeets. The whole aspect is very
pleasing, the aviaries being well kept and attractive. A very bright
Bed-shining Parrakeet, from Fiji, attracted my attention, among
many other rarities. A long distance away, and higher up on the
slope of the hill, there is a very large Wader aviary and a Game farm,

with numerous roomy pens ; many Pheasants and innumerable Peafowl
live and breed there, as well as what made " Rancho Sespe " famous
in the avicultural world--a breeding pair of Ceram Cassowaries and
their offspring. The male and the female live in adjoining pens, but
separately : they can only be safely put together when the female is
in breeding condition, and for a few hours at a time. Afterwards, the
cock, much the' smaller bird of the two, sits on the eggs and rears the
young. In 1934 two were bred and they look now almost like adults.
Last year the hen killed the chicks through the wire partition, so that
now the male and his brood are removed farther away. This year
there is another fine chick. This achievement is almost unique in
aviculture, as there are only a very few records of Cassowaries
breeding in European zoos. Mr. W. Honsinger supervises with the
greatest care and keenness the Rancho Sespe collection.
The least said of the very poor public zoo of Los Angeles the
better, but there is an excellent one at San Diego, very cleverly
managed by Mrs. B. Benchley. It is very remarkable that a city of
150,000 inhabitants has been able to promote and can sustain such
an important establishment.
The San Diego Zoo occupies a large piece of ground in Balboa
Park, all artificially wooded (mostly eucalyptus and acacias), with
deep gullies and steep hills, very picturesque. There are some very
good new buildings, but the greatest part of the accommodation is-
of the roomy, semi-wild, outdoor sort. There are excellent and rare
mammals, including two wonderful mountain Gorillas ; but the bird
collection is particularly important. Parrots, particularly Lories,
(there is a hybrid Eos histrio X E. horned), are very numerous, all
kept in outdoor aviaries, many breeding regularly. Doves and small
birds are also very interesting, and will soon be moved to new and
better quarters. A pond is stocked with some Waterfowl and, during
the winter, is crowded with wild migrants, mostly Pintails ; it took
these birds only a couple of years to find this quite small artificial piece
of water, hidden under trees. A special feature of the zoo is the two
immense flying cages, built on steep slopes over large trees. One measures.
150 by 50 ft., and accommodates a mixed collection of large birds, among,
which are a Frigate Bird, which has lived there now for eight years r

Kagus, Galapagos Gulls, all sorts of Herons, Tree Ducks, Ibises, Storks,
Cranes, etc. The other one, just completed, is larger still, and contains
Eagles and Vultures. The Birds of Prey collection is excellent, and
I noticed especially four Galapagos Buzzards and a California Condor.
The San Diego bird collection, one of the best in America, has the
great advantage, owing to the climate, of being kept in the open where
they have a much better chance to become established and to breed.
At liberty in the grounds are literally hundreds of Chachalaca ( Ortalis
vetula ), or Texas Guans, which all come from a dozen originally
introduced birds, and breed freely in the trees, as well as some other
Game birds.
Another interesting establishment is the Catalina Island Bird Park.
Catalina Island is about 20 miles from San Pedro Harbour. It is a
large, mountainous island, sufficiently well watered and wooded, the
property of the Wrigley family (of chewing-gum fame), who have
developed it into a pleasure resort. The late Mr. Wrigley, who was a
keen bird fancier, combined his taste with his interests and created
the Bird Park both for his amusement and as an attraction to visitors.
Since his death, it has been maintained mostly for the second reason.
Eor many years the Bird Park was managed by Mr. E. H. Lewis,
who is now organizing the Waikiki Bird Park at Honolulu. The Bird
Park is situated a few miles inland in a pretty and well-sheltered
valley. It is a walled-in enclosure, with a large and high round-shaped
flying cage in front, and several paths with rows of aviaries, all nicely
built and laid out. At the back there is roomy breeding accommoda-
tion. The collection of birds is large and general, and contains very good
things. There are many Pheasants and other Game birds, some Water-
fowl, Ostriches, Rheas, Cassowaries, various Cranes, and other Waders,
different Crowned Pigeons, Doves, a large number of Parrots, and many
small birds, including Birds of Paradise. Many birds breed, and I
noticed some curious hybrids : two beautiful Macaws (Blue and
Yellow X Red and Blue), a lovely apricot colour underneath, pale
greenish blue above, much prettier than either parents ; some Lories
(Eos bornea X Tricoglossus moluccanus), and Mikado X Swinhoe's
Pheasants. The collection is well cared for by Mr. D. G. Mobley, and
kept up to its standard, and it is quite an interesting and pretty show

kept in more roomy enclosures.
I must stop here, and I fear that I have not done justice
to our American colleagues ; but our pages are, alas, limited. I hope,
however, that it will give our European members some idea of what has
been achieved in the United States, mostly in the course of the last
ten years, which is quite remarkable. Also my numerous American
bird friends, who gave me such a cordial welcome, may find here a
small tribute to their great kindness and hospitality.

By Maurice Amsler, M.B., F.Z.S.
It is entirely thanks to the enterprise and keenness of that ardent
naturalist, M. Jean Delacour, that we aviculturists have recently had
the opportunity of seeing and some of us even of possessing two new
species of Bluebird (Sialia).
When I describe these birds as new I am open to correction ; but
as far as my own knowledge goes they certainly have not been imported
into Europe for very many years. An article by Mr. Karl Plath in the
Avicultural Magazine of 1934, page 40, described the Western and
Arctic Bluebirds, and made our mouths water for even a glance at these
rarities which were described as much more beautiful than the Common
or Eastern Bluebird (Sialia sialis), the Blue Bobin which we all know
and love. It speaks volumes for M. Delacour's pull as a celebrated
ornithologist that he was permitted to collect and bring to Europe
several pairs of the Western and two pairs of the Arctic species.
All the Bluebirds are very strictly protected in the United States
and in Canada and this is as it should be for their diet consists almost
entirely of insects, very little fruit being taken and of the latter
practically none is cultivated fruit. The genus is, therefore, entirely
a desirable one and in addition to this Bluebirds are so familiar and
beautiful that they are looked upon much as our own redbreast is in
Great Britain.

M. Amsler--Recently Imported Bluebirds
When I was a boy and fairly adept with a catapult the one bird
which it was bad form to shoot was the Robin and the same state of
affairs holds good with Bluebirds in America. The resemblance goes
further, for Bluebirds are very friendly and love to build their nests
in the neighbourhood of houses and farmsteads. Any site which is at
all possible such as an old tin can, a ledge under the eaves, or a hole
in a rotten trunk being acceptable for a home. Artificial nest-boxes
are also readily occupied. Like our own Robin, Bluebirds are so
confiding that they are the very easiest prey to the simplest form of
trap baited with a few mealworms or other insects. In the absence of
protection they could be trapped and exported in large numbers to
this and other countries where they would find a ready sale. It is not
so very many years ago that the Blue Robin could be bought from
Hamlyn at the London docks for 15s. to 25s. a pair.
Three species of Bluebirds are recognized and the following notes
are written from my own observation amplified by Taverner's Birds
of Canada and also from The Home Life of Wild Birds by Herrick.
The Red-breasted or Eastern Bluebird ( Sialia sialis) : This is the
species with which we are all familiar and one which has been freely
bred in this country for many years. Above, from crown to tail
including face, deep blue, breast and flanks chestnut red. Abdomen
definitely white. Female similar but duller.
Taverner in distinguishing this species from the Western does not
stress the white abdomen of the Eastern variety.
The female Eastern might be confused with the Western, but the
latter has a distinctly greyish throat and the lower abdomen is grey-
blue instead of white. Herrick, writing from Cleveland, describes the
males as arriving about the 20th March, the females following a few
days later. The call note of the male is well described by the words
" Purity-purity
The Chestnut-backed or Western Bluebird ( Sialia mexicana
occidentalis) : Above, from crown to tail, including face and throat ,
intense deep purplish blue. An indefinite collar of chestnut extends
backwards from the breast and flanks which are rich chestnut red.
It is this collar band which gives the bird its somewhat misleading
name of " Chestnut-backed The abdomen is dull blue.

The male of this species has the blues much more brilliant than the
Eastern, but the difference which at once strikes the observer is the
fact that the blue extends forward from the back and cheeks and forms
a beautiful blue collar or gorget with a sharp line of demarcation from
the chestnut of the upper breast.
I do not know why it is, but the cock of the species under con-
sideration always reminds me of the Kufous-bellied Niltava. I hate to
say so, for it seems almost disloyal, but the Western is a much more
beautiful bird than our old Eastern friend. The female has already
been partly described. She is in her turn not quite so attractive as the
Eastern hen, her blues being if anything a little duller, but this may
be due to the fact that my own hen of the latter species is an old and
well-coloured specimen.
Although these two species much resemble each other and although
they are obviously very closely allied it is said that their territories
do not overlap, and that interbreeding does not take place. When
one has used a good many superlatives in describing the two foregoing
birds, it is difficult to find adjectives suitable to the Arctic or Mountain
Bluebird (Sialia corrucoides ). Male, all solid metallic light sky-blue,
paling on head and breast. Lower abdomen white. Female with blue
very much reduced, head and back with blue veiled with ashy grey.
Under parts pale brownish ash, the strongest on face and throat, the
blue shows clearly only on wings, rump, and tail.
Juvenile plumage almost identical with parallel plumage of Eastern
and Western Bluebird, namely the back is a brownish blue flecked with
white spots, throat spotted with rich brown and white.
The wings and tail only show any definite blue and this is much
darker in the Eastern and Western than in the Mountain Bluebird.
Habitats
Eastern Bluebird: temperate Eastern North America, in Canada
across the southern part of the Dominion, commonly to Manitoba
more rarely in Saskatchewan.
Western Bluebird: western North America, in Canada, southern
British Columbia--this is the common Bluebird of the south-west
coast.

Mountain Bluebird : western North America. In Canada from the
west coast east to Manitoba, north to the Yukon and Mackenzie
Valley.
It is unlikely that any more of these birds will be imported in our
lifetime and it behoves those who possess any one of the species to
make a great effort to perpetuate it. This can be done with tolerable
certainty in the case of newly imported birds ; but as I have elsewhere
pointed out Bluebirds are less ready fully to rear their young in sub-
sequent years, when the aid of our native Robin can be called in, or
the brave owner can give his Bluebirds semi-liberty when they have
hatched their young. One of my friends has a pair of Eastern Blue
Robins which rears its young quite happily in an old tin hung up in a
cage some 4 feet long.
They are at the moment due to hatch (20th March). It is possible
that her success is due to the fact that the birds have no distractions
and no other possible " eligible sites " to make them think about
further families.
My own attempts at cage-breeding in the past, it must be admitted,
have always been doomed to failure. The clutches were small, either
two or three, the eggs usually clear, and on one occasion they were
white instead of the beautiful hedge-sparrow blue.
All adults should be ringed with distinctive colour or number
and the young ringed to correspond to the above. It is only by this
method that we shall in the future avoid extensive inbreeding. I had
until recently, a pair which were the offspring several times inbred
from my original Bluebirds which came to me over ten years ago :
by the acquisition of a new pair I have been able to " swap " the birds :
and thus I am certain of two unrelated pairs. There is also a pair of
the newly imported Western species, the hen of which has caused me j
much anxiety by sneezing and rapid breathing. Although they had
been outside until their arrival here I have brought them into a warm
room and pray for the best.
How much wiser it would be to collect stamps or china rather than
birds ! The value of the former increases as time goes on ; they are
everlasting and neither can ever cause one depression or lack of sleep
by sickness or death.

I have been through the mill with the breeding of Bluebirds and
the experience I have gained is, for what it is worth, welcome to breeders
who may be interested.
When the young leave the nest, whether the parents have reared in
a closed aviary or at semi-liberty, always catch up the whole family
and place them for a time in a large cage with no nest-box. Bluebirds
use very little soft food in rearing their young, so an unlimited supply
of insects must be given. Mealworms, of course ; also cockroaches if
you can get a supply ; live ants 5 eggs in summer, and a very few clean
gentles.
Live ants 5 eggs together with some ants are a great incentive to the
young to feed themselves ; they notice an ant carrying the white egg
along and have a peck at it. At first they miss but practice makes
perfect and the next step is a mealworm. Finally mealworms killed
by pinching the head and chopped into three or four pieces can be
dropped into the soft food. As soon as this last course is recognized
and eaten, the old birds can be removed to their own aviary where they
should go to nest again if the season is not too far advanced.
1 have found that a period of almost exactly ten days elapses
between either the removal of eggs or of young, and the laying of the
next clutch.
When well on to food the young are of course best housed in an
aviary or large flight; but here a final word of warning : Beware of
mealworms! I well remember my best season&apos;s success. I had twelve
very fine young Bluebirds reared from one pair, the first eight had been
brought up by redbreasts and the remaining four by their own parents
at complete liberty, that is the Bluebirds had built and reared the
young in a nest-box hung up in my Eton garden. The young were
all together in a fair sized aviary of mixed inhabitants but to my great
chagrin I noticed that all was not well, that the youngsters did not
take much interest in their soft food, but were frantic in their scrambles
for mealworms, of which a large number were thrown down at frequent
intervals each day. They had, moreover, a look which every observant
bird-keeper knows. The eye, which in this genus is especially large,
intelligent, and staring, becomes smaller and duller without being
closed. To cut a long story short I had the mortification of seeing my

young Blue Robins die one after the other until only three or four were
left; but before we had reached this stage my man, who was as keen
and interested as myself, suggested that we were overdoing the meal-
worms. It is false economy to withhold expensive food from valuable
birds, for dead birds are of no value. I took his advice and completely
cut off their supply of mealworms, from which moment the birds
began to improve.
We had learnt our lesson and in subsequent years my youngsters
only got about six worms each per day. I am glad to say that the
epidemic of deaths has not recurred.
I have at the moment between thirty and forty nest-boxes and logs
hung up in my garden and wood, in addition to which there are a
couple of dozen more in the gardens of two or three obliging friends.
Unless placed in a shaded position, the entrance holes of artificial
nest-boxes should not face south ; and when selecting trees or posts
on which to hang them always bear in mind the possibility of wandering
cats and rats. Also see that the boxes are quite firm and do not shake
with the wind. On several occasions I have had faute de mieux to make
use of Robins' nests which were in very dangerous positions, e.g. low
down on a bank and possibly near a pond or farm buildings, just the
kind of place where one might expect rats. In such cases I have
smeared Renardine on the branches and grass surrounding the nests.
I believe that creosote is equally efficacious. Whether these substances
keep rats, stoats, and cats away on account of their smell or because
they destroy the scent of the young birds and nest, I do not pretend
to know ; but I have never had a tragedy when taking this precaution.
And now, perhaps, one last word as to foster parents. Redbreasts
are certainly the most reliable and easily found. They can cover five
Bluebirds' eggs quite comfortably though these are much larger than
their own. No doubt any of the warblers or the Wagtails or the Hedge-
sparrow, on which the Cuckoo is parasitic, might serve the purpose.
Great Tits will hatch Bluebirds, but do not rear satisfactorily ;
this is not for want of trying but rather, I think, because of an unsuit-
able dietary, possibly one which contains a certain amount of seeds,
kernels, and other vegetable substances which do not suit the young
Bluebirds.
Blue Tits on the other hand appear to be more wholly insectivorous

.than the Great Tits and they together with the Cole Tit will hatch and
rear Bluebirds quite happily, although owing to their size they cannot
be expected to deal with more than a couple of eggs.
We are told not to count our chickens before the eggs are hatched,
nor must we count our Bluebirds before the eggs are laid but, to give
these birds their due once the birds are mated and the cock is feeding
his hen, eggs very soon appear and a clear egg is of the rarest occurrence.
Also, they will lay up to twenty eggs in a season. As against this how
common it is to find one or more clear eggs together with the youngsters
in the nests of many wild birds living under what are much better
and more natural conditions than those of aviary birds.
Lastly a word of comfort to those who propose working on the
lines which I have so lengthily described. There will be disappoint-
ments and they may be your own fault or possibly that of some
animal or bird of prey, but be comforted by the knowledge that in
nature there is always a war going on between the weak and the
strong. In my somewhat extensive search and study of Robins' nests,
which extends over a great number of years, I have come to the
conclusion that in only about 50 per cent of nests begun does all go
well to the full rearing and flight of the young. Either one of the birds
is killed and the survivor has to hunt around for a new mate before
beginning a nest; possibly the eggs may be clear or addled owing to
the disturbance of the sitting bird ; or they may be taken by some
rodent or predatory bird ; and lastly the same fate may overtake the
helpless chicks. All this time both parents in their frantic task of
finding sufficient food for their offspring are open to constant dangers,
though, be it noted, wild birds quite unlike aviary birds are much
more distrustful of humans and other possible dangers when they
know that a whole brood of young is dependent on their own safety.
In the case of Robins it must be admitted that this trait is less marked
than in many other species ; to give an example it is well nigh
impossible to trap adult sparrows during the breeding season.
Should a reasonable number of these birds be bred this coming
season, it would be interesting to hear of such successes in the Magazine
and possibly to arrange exchanges so that unrelated pairs could be
supplied to members who might like to try their hands at the breeding
of these delightful birds.

curious resemblance to The Bird-Fancier&apos;s Recreation, published by

is the letterpress throughout. When dealing with the Red Bird (1735,
p. 89) the [Author] states he has " been a Dealer in Birds for forty
years past ". Mr. Wright ([N.D.] preface) says he " has made the
rearing Birds his Diversion near Twenty Years ". The authors of the
two books would therefore appear to be different but I fancy this
book is only a crib--almost a reproduction--of the book of 1735.

By H. Hampe, Brunswick
In my article on "Inseparables" (Vogel ferner Lander, viii, 1934)
I surmised that the difficulty in breeding Bed-headed Lovebirds was
to be explained by the fact that in freedom they make their nests
in anthills, and therefore did not take to the usual hollow log nest-box.
My attempt in 1933 to solve this question led to partial success, which
I will briefly record.
In order to give the birds a somewhat natural substitute for the
anthill, I built a hill about three feet high out of a mixture of clay,
sand, and chalk, and in addition, I made an inner wall at the top
corner of their flight about 2 feet high and 10 inches thick of clay and
mud. The hen, which replaced the one lost in 1933, came into breeding
condition in 1934 and set to work on a wooden box, enlarging the
entrance considerably. She continued this the following year, and
then began as her predecessor had done to try to make a hole in
the mortar of the wall. Early in May, 1936, she began at last to pay
attention to the artificial wall into which I had meanwhile driven a
couple of short perches. From now on she was always to be found
there and continually occupied in making a hole. By the beginning
of July her task was finished with a little help from me in loosening
the hard clay. She had made a hole as big as my fist, reaching right
back to the permanent wall, first straight and then turning left, an
almost horizontal passage which, like the entrance, measured about
If inches across. The female ran in and out like a weasel, she usually
stayed four to five minutes in the hole and then came out for a short
time. She appeared to use her beak only. The male took no part
in the work, but continually sat singing and swaying by the hole.
By the beginning of August the female began carrying in nesting
material in the shape of very small pieces of fresh willow leaves, very
occasionally bark as well; she did not pack them in her rump feathers
only as hitherto observed, but like Agapornis taranta in every bit
of plumage she could reach with her beak except the flight feathers.

The male did not help here either, if he did stick a few scraps in his
feathers he soon shook them out again.
Naturally no domed nest was built, only the bottom of the hole
thinly covered with pieces of leaves. After repeated pairings the first
egg was laid on 12th August between 2.30 and 5.45 p.m., probably
near the end of this period ; on the 13th, 15th, 18th, and 20th she laid
again, five in all. The hen began to sit at once. She sat very close
and was fed on the nest by the male ; she only came out once or twice
in the day.
Unfortunately four of the eggs were infertile and the only fertile
one soon died. A second clutch laid the end of September, were also
infertile. I assume that the male was too old. The five eggs of the
first clutch measured 22 X 17*18 ; they weighed 4 grammes.
Even though complete success was not reached, it appears to me,
from the eagerness which the birds showed and the natural way in
which they behaved until the eggs were found to be infertile, I was
on the right path. I shall repeat my effort, and hope next time to
attain my object.

I have several times stated in these notes that one of the principal
objectives of the O.P.S. is to take measures to save many rare pheasants
to posterity. At the present time is it not extraordinary that such
very beautiful pheasants as the Satyr and Blyth Tragopan should be
so rare in confinement ? The former is not rare in its native state,
but before many years it is probable that owing to continual persecution
this species will become exceedingly rare.
The reason for the present scarcity in our aviaries is due to the
fact that only a very small percentage of pheasants that leave the
shores of India reach us in good condition, it is a lamentable fact,
but true.
Monsieur Delacour explained in an article in the last Journal the
great difficulties that have to be overcome in order to bring any
pheasants safely to Europe.

150 N. Wharton-Tigar--Notes from the London Zoo
The O.P.S. is now formulating a scheme in conjunction with the
Calcutta Zoo to import both Blyths and Satyr Tragopan, as well as
other rare pheasants in good numbers and we will hope in good con-
dition. Mr. H. A. Fooks, who is Secretary of the Calcutta Zoo, and
is incidentally a member of the O.P.S., is w T orking in collaboration
with us. When the time comes these birds will be shipped in suitable
crates, and before being shipped will have spent at least three months
in the Zoo.
This will be a step forward and every member of the O.P.S. will
have an opportunity of purchasing these birds.
It has been suggested that our Journal should be printed in French
and German. This may seem at first sight a most formidable under-
taking, but thanks to Monsieur Malisoux, of Belgium, the French
translation and printing will not prove so formidable as may be thought.
The German edition is another matter, but it is possible that some
friend may come forward to help us.
Our idea in issuing Journals in these languages is obviously to
obtain new members from the Continent. Now I do hope that members
of the Avicultural Society will not think I am always harping on the
subject of new members, w*e are not " money grubbers ". I can assure
one and all that our only object is to obtain funds and arouse interest
in the activities of our Society. There is great value in the old saying,
" There is strength in numbers." If we appear too ambitious or too
insistent on our activities we shall be forgiven, for you will be the
first to admit that our activities are in a good and worthy cause, viz.

Last month while in the Parrot House, the Lories looked so
wonderful in their brilliant plumage, that I decided that this month
I must write about the fine collection housed there.
These birds have always been considered more delicate than others
of the Parrot tribe, they require warmth, and until it was discovered
that they thrive better on milky foods and fruit alone, there was

N. Wharton-Tigar--Notes from the London Zoo 151
trouble indeed. They are, I believe, extremely subject to fits ; and
if once a bird is so attacked there is little hope of complete recovery.
Lories are really lovely to look at, easily tamed, and most
affectionate and occasionally a good talker is found among them.
In the larger Parrot House, in the wire aviaries against the wall,
are to be found the Ornate Lorikeet (Trichoglossus ornatus ), from
Celebes. The Zoo has two good pairs of these, and the ones here
housed have laid eggs several times, and the Red-collared Lorikeet
(T. rubritorques ), from North-Western Australia. This species is very
similar to the well-known Swainson's, of which more anon. It differs
only in having the nape of the neck orange red and its breast more
orange. The Black Lory (Chalcopittacus ater), from New Guinea, very
rare, velvety purple black, showing greenish yellow and purple red
on tail.
In these aviaries are also the Scaly-breasted Lorikeet (Eutelijpsitta
chlorolepidota), Australia, the Blue-faced Lorikeet (T. hsematodus),
Timor. The Red Lory (Eos molluccus), Borneo and South Moluccas,
entirely red, except for black wing tips and a blue spot in the middle
of the wings. A true pair of the Yellow-back Lory (Domicella flavo-
palliatus), absolutely tame, and also of the Red-fronted Lory ( C . scin-
tillata), ten years in the collection, tame, and in lovely condition.
Then we come to a pair of Swainson's Lorikeets (T. moluccanus),
Eastern Australia. This variety has been bred in very fair numbers
in this country. I shall never forget my astonishment when, years
ago, I called on Mr. John Frostick, the veteran expert bird-keeper.
In his bird-room, by no means an ideal one, he had breeding in a
wooden box in an ordinary Parrot cage, a pair of these Lorikeets, and
he pointed with very justifiable pride to what seemed to me at least
a dozen very fine sleek youngsters that the pair had previously bred.
Now we leave the larger Parrot House and step down to the smaller
one, well known as the home of the large Macaws. Here we find Forsten's
Lorikeet ( T . forsteni), Sunbawa, and the lovely little Varied Lorikeet
(Ptilosclera versicolor), North and Western Australia, small and dainty,
prevailing colour green, the crown red, with breast yellow and mauve,
a very desirable little creature, bred in captivity for the first time
last year by Messrs. Boosey and Brooksbank. In this house there are

three examples of the Musk Lorikeet (Glossopsitticus concinnus),
Australia, lovely, but extremely delicate and hard to keep.
Here also are more of the true Lories--the Blue-streaked (Eos
reticulata, from Tenimber Islands), the Purple-capped (Domicella
domicella), Ceram, the White-rumped Lory [Eos fuscata), New Guinea,
and a quaint example of the Jobi Lory (Domicella lory jobiensis).
This poor bird was evidently badly reared ; at one time it was covered
with new quills, which refused to open, and was then known in the
Parrot House as the Porcupine Lory ! The quills have now made
some attempt to open the wrong way round !
Now we come to the two rarest and most intriguing varieties in
the collection. The White-throated Lory (Coriphilus taitranus),
Society Isles, a pair of these ; words fail me in giving an account
of the charm of these birds. Mr. Boland Green recently did a beautiful
sketch of this and the following species, so you all know what they
look like. The Blue Lories are so tame and friendly, so engaging, one longs
to possess them. They have been placed in a very large aviary cage
and are toying with the idea of going to nest. The Ruby Lory (Vinia
kuhli), Washington and Panning Islands, too lovely, wine red ; also
tame, and the rarest Lory in the collection.
A sad little story is connected with the acquisition by the Zoo of
the two last-named species : a great lady, beautiful and rich, cruising
the Pacific in her yacht, collected these little treasures and brought
them home in triumph. On arriving in this country she learned to her
consternation that they must be confiscated ; she had no permit
to import Parrots--naturally, she had never heard of the Parrot ban.
Mr. Seth-Smith, the ever kind, was called in, and said her lovely
birds could be deposited at the Zoo, and when the ban is lifted, her
Lories will be returned to her. Can nothing be done to speed up the
day, and relieve her anguish, and that of many others, deprived of
the joy of possessing one of the best friends a man or woman can
possess ?

of those aviculturists who either failed to obtain a copy of the first
edition or have taken up the study of aviculture during the time the
book was unobtainable. The result is a handsome volume abounding
in plates, coloured and plain, and packed with all the information
most needed by experienced and inexperienced aviculturists. A great
part has been rewritten and revised by Monsieur Delacour, the general
classification and nomenclature brought up to date, and many additions
made. As far as is known, mention has been made of most species
kept in captivity in Europe, together with such facts and hints as are
necessary for their health and comfort, housing, food, general manage-
ment, and treatment in disease.
The following genera are included in this volume : Crows and their
allies ; Weavers, Finches, Buntings, Tanagers, Sun and Sugar Birds,
Fruitsuckers, Thrushes and their allies, Warblers, Swallows, Pittas, and
Martins, etc. There is a good index, and the book is clearly printed and
handsomely bound. It may be said, without fear of contradiction, that
no aviculturist can afford to be without a copy, and the more it is studied
the better it will be for both man and bird.

of South-East New Guinea and is well shown in our illustration. Mr.
Shaw Mayer has imported several specimens, and a pair which arrived
in 1936, from which our drawing was made, have done very well in
the Tropical House of the Zoological Society, where the male has been
seen to display on occasions. This consists of elongating the body tG
its full extent and at the same time spreading the pectoral fans which
form a continuation of the flank plumes and give the appearance of a
pair of brilliantly coloured wings. Then the bird bends forward,
elevating the tail and bringing into prominence the brilliant metallic
colouring of the head. The long, sickle-shaped bill is used for probing
crevices for grubs and insects and, doubtless, for extracting the juices
from flowers. A warm and damp atmosphere seems to suit this
forest-loving species.

156 R. H. Masure--The Birds of a Carribean Cruise
THE BIRDS OF A CARRIBEAN CRUISE
By R. H. Masure
While the City of St. Louis is hardly a Carribean port and hence
out of place in this article, I cannot refrain from telling you about
my impressions of the bird collection in its Zoological Garden. Other
collections may boast of more species of birds and more individuals
of each kind, but they cannot compare to St. Louis for beauty and
novelty of their birds. As one enters the bird house at St. Louis he
is confronted by a large cage about 30 feet long and 20 feet
wide that contains a variety of birds including Mynahs, various wading
birds such as Scarlet Ibis, Swainson's Toucans and other small perching
birds, all living together in perfect harmony in what seems to be a
small piece of nature transplanted into this house. The background
is painted to give a diorama effect such as one sees in museum cases,
and what is most remarkable and in fact the most striking feature of
this cage is the fact that it is entirely lacking in glass or any other
barrier on the side facing the observer. It is truly exciting to look at
all these birds without even a glass to obstruct the vision. This
seemingly difficult feat, of keeping birds in a space without actually
confining them in four walls, is accomplished by introducing each
specimen originally with a clipped wing so that it could not fly out.
When it becomes accustomed to living and eating in this space it seldom
strays out even after its wings have grown. I understand that the
only time that any of these birds do venture out is at night and that
they always return of their own accord. The rest of the cages all have
glass fronts and several others are large enough to have living plants
in them so that they are like a portion of a forest. The collection of
Weaver Finches and another of Chloropsis Bulbuls and other soft-
billed birds are both of this type. I am sorry that my visit was so
short that I could only remember a few of the birds I saw. I offer the
following list as a few of the rarer species that I can remember : Greater
Bird of Paradise, Queen of Bavaria's Conures (these beautiful yellow
Conures are the first of the species that I have ever seen and are very
rare), Cock of the Rock (another rare and striking bird that is fowl-
like in form, having a brilliant silky orange plumage and a peculiar

fleshy crest on the head), Hyacinth Macaw, Lesser Sulfur Crested
Cockatoo (the first of this species that I have ever seen as a zoo
inmate), and a large cage of Humming-birds and Sugar Birds that
was heavily planted. I cannot tell you enough about this beautiful
bird collection, and I hasten to tell you that you are missing a great
deal if your visit to St. Louis does not include a trip to the bird
house.
The following Wednesday morning I sailed from New Orleans,
La., on the S.S. Sixaola, of the United Fruit Co., for Honduras and
Guatamala. Sailing down the Mississippi river we saw many gulls
which I did not identify and Brown Pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis ).
As we left the river and entered the gulf in the evening, I was unable
to see any birds along the coast. The next birds were encountered on
Saturday afternoon when we docked at Puerto Cortez, Spanish
Honduras. I cannot refrain from telling you how thrilling it was to
realize that I was about to set foot in the tropics, that most interesting
of all the climatic zones of the world. If you are interested in birds
or plant life nothing is quite so exciting. While waiting for the officials
of Honduras to board the boat so that we could enter the country
I saw several Frigate Birds (Fregata magnificens), very large gull-like
birds with dark backs, naked red throats, and long forked tails, that
were circling about the ship. Floating on the water were more of the
Brown Pelicans, and Common Booby (Sula leucogastra). There were
other gulls flying about the boat that I was unable to identify.
Glancing at the shore I saw many of the large Black Vultures (Coragyps
aratus) one of the most common birds of the tropics. These large
clumsy black birds with their featherless gray heads were seen walking
about quite unafraid of human beings. As I followed the progress of
one of the birds I watched it walk upon the porch and into the doorway
of a " Cantina ", one of the native waterfront cafes. Another walked
down a railroad track and still others flew about and perched on the
metal roofs of the houses in the village. Wherever you go you would
see large numbers of this scavenger bird that is often termed the
" Department of Health " because it eats all the refuse that would
spread diseases and make the tropics very dirty and unhealthy. No
one ever molests these large birds and I am sure that a collector would

meet with opposition if he were interested in either a live or a museum
specimen.
After leaving the boat we proceeded on the local railroad about
20 miles, a portion of the run between Cortez and Tela, the capital
of Spanish Honduras. On this journey we saw many small birds that
were impossible to identify because of the swift glimpses of the birds
as they flew across our paths of vision. Along one of the rivers we saw
a few splendid specimens of the Snowy Egret (Egretta candidissima).
One of the trees near the railroad was tenanted by a colony of Black
Howling Monkeys, which of course are not birds, but are a part of the
tropics that one should not miss. They very obligingly demonstrated
their vocal ability as a challenge to the blowing of the engine's steam
whistle. On either side of the train we saw great lush fields of vivid
green banana trees with large clusters of fruit and then patches of
jungle with high trees overgrown with orchids perched in their branches.
The remains of fields of sugar cane, another of the native crops, were
also visible as we rode along. At one stop some of the natives came
aboard the train with small rough looking pineapples, another of the
native fruits. We saw the " Peenyas ", as the natives call the pine-
apples, growing on the hillsides. Our return journey to Cortez was made
in the dark as we were delayed by a banana train that broke down
on the track and had to be repaired before we could proceed on our
way, along the single track. It was surprising how rapidly the sun dis-
appeared, and we left the countryside in total darkness. It seemed
that in a very few minutes the bright sun had left and evening w r as
upon us. With the change in light came a sudden drop in temperature
that made a coat of some kind necessary for comfort. There were
also a few mosquitoes that seemed to bother the ladies' unprotected
legs. I stood on the front platform of the coach for most of the journey
and did not enounter even one mosquito or. receive a single bite, which
is more than I can say for my experience in a Chicago park on
an evening walk. When we finally arrived back in the port our boat
was blowing its whistle so we had no time to investigate the city and
its inhabitants. The most vivid impression that I have from the
village of Puerto Cortez is the large numbers of barbers and dentists
that we saw from the train as it went through the main street of the

port. All along through this small and very poor town we saw many
signs reading' " Bentista 53 and " Barbera
The journey from Honduras to Puerto Barrios, Guatemala, the
land of the Quezal, was very short. We arrived at this second port
of call about 2 a.m. -Sunday morning, having left Honduras Saturday
evening, about 9 p.m. The officials of the Guatemalan Government
boarded the boat soon after it landed and awakened everyone to pass
their tourist cards that are necessary for landing in any port. Several
of the party thought that a visit to the port itself might be exciting
at that hour of the night so we walked the long steel pier, which is
about half a mile in length, to reach the town itself. We saw the rail-
road station, and as the town seemed entirely deserted we hurriedly
returned to the boat. That morning at 7 a.m. we left the boat and
found the small launch and a guide that was furnished to me for my
trip into the jungle. Peter, our guide was a negro from Belize, British
Honduras, and spoke Spanish as well as English with an Oxford accent.
Barrios is a large and beautiful bay surrounded by mountains just as
Cortez was. The water supply for the port is piped from a reservoir
that lies 3 miles in the jungle on the opposite side of the bay. This
jungle is one of the wildest in the world, although it is not tenanted
by many large animals. If it were not for the small path that runs
along the pipe-line it would be necessary to cut your way through the
dense vegetation. As we approached the shore of the bay in our small
boat we could see a luxuriant palm grove, and when we landed we
came into a short space of swamp full of Fiddler Crabs and large white
Amaryllis that were in bloom. We left our boat and proceeded into
the thick vegetation that was made up of many types of palms, bread-
fruits, papayas, bananas, sensitive plants, and large elephant ear-like
plants, lantana with small red blossoms, a plant with large white
calla-like flowers, many thick vines, and other tropical trees and plants
that I was unable to identify. We soon heard the gurgling noise that
told me we were near some Toucans. After searching around for a
few minutes we saw five or six of these large birds in a very tall tree,
the exact species being impossible to determine. Later on we heard
and finally saw a small tan and white bird that seemed to be some
sort of a Honey Creeper, which I was unable to identify. At the

end of the trail we saw a large tree inhabited by a chattering
flock of Petz's Conures (Eupsittula canicularis) or " Parakeetas " in
the Spanish vernacular. As we retraced our steps we saw a magnificent
pair of Macaws (Am macao or A. chloroptera) screeching as they flew
across the sky, a thrill which I will never forget. Then we had the
good fortune to see some Toucans at close range and a small flock
of Euphonia Tanagers (Tanagra crassirostris). It was very difficult
to observe the details of birds' plumage because the vegetation was
very thick, and the light quite dim, and the birds were usually flying
about or perched high in the large trees, some of which were about as
high as a six or seven story building. About noon when we were nearing
our landing place we encountered a light shower. As it was hot and
damp we hardly minded the additional moisure, until it made observing
through glasses impossible, when I decided to cut a large banana
leaf which made a wonderful umbrella balanced on my head. For
the sake of variety I cut a huge palm leaf and carried it above my
head to ward ofl the rain. Coming up to a large coco-nut palm our
guide asked us if we would like some fresh coco-nut milk. As I seemed
enthusiastic he proceeded to knock down a large coco-nut with a
long branch of a tree, and chopped the end ofl with his macheta, the
native knife and implement of all work. I drank the cool milk and
really felt just a little primitive. Contrary to the popular " South
Seas " notion the natives in Central American do not ascend the tall
trees to gather the coco-nuts but use a large stick to " poke " them down.
Soon after this we left the jungle trail in our little boat bound for
Santa Tomas, a small primitive Indian settlement between our first
landing and Puerto Barrios. Santa Tomas was originally a Belgian
colony and a flourishing one until Barrios was built. It was interesting
to see people in this settlement, which resembled a cow pasture with
rambling frame shacks, that were very light and quite European looking,
probably descendants of the original Belgian settlers. The sun was
very hot and the air dry but we were fairly comfortable as we proceeded
from hut to hut inquiring for " monos y pacheros ", monkeys and birds.
On inquiring about a ripe and lucious papaya we saw on a roof, I dis-
covered a beautiful Yellow-cheeked Amazon Parrot (Amazona autum-
nalis) perched in a small tree in front of the house. Peter inquired

and was told that the bird was tame and for sale. I reached out and
" Lorita " perched on my hand and walked on my shoulder, where
she stayed until early that evening when we reached our boat. She
was full-winged but so tame that she never made any attempt to fly
away either as we walked through the port or proceeded in our launch
to the large boat at the pier. This Parrot was the only available pet
animal in the village, and was purchased for a few dollars. Lorita,
which means little parrot in Spanish, is the name that is given to
most Parrots by the Central American natives.
Once again we entered our small launch to complete another part
of our circular journey and reach Puerto Barrios. We arrived in the
port about two o'clock in the afternoon when most of the citizens
were enjoying the afternoon siesta. Everywhere we went we found
the lady of the house asleep in her doorway making it impossible to
enter without awakening her. The men and the children were usually
inside the house and it is interesting to note that whenever business
was to be transacted the senora took care of all the bargaining. I was
very fortunate in finding an exceedingly tame and interesting Squirrel
Monkey in the possession of one of the homes visited. This very small
monkey was a real house pet and his owners were very reluctant to
part with him, although they finally agreed to sell him when I told
them that securing a monkey was one of the purposes of my long
journey. We added " Chichi " to our entourage and proceeded around
the town in cur quest for pets. We tracked down a series of parrot-like
squeaks and found a very tame Petz's Conure which I finally purchased
for a dollar. Like the Parrot the little Conure was without a cage
and had to be carried on the hand. It was very tame and spoke Spanish.
We traced down many other Conures by using the one we had purchased
as an indicator ; the minute we heard a parrot " squawk " he would
answer. Unfortunately all of the other birds we located were of the
same species. Later on we found a very tame Black Howling Monkey,
but as they are quite large I did not purchase it. Our collecting ended
that afternoon with the finding of a Blue-wing Sugar-bird (Cyanerpes
cyanea), a Yellow Euphonia ( Tanagra crassirostris) , two Yellow-breasted
Finches or Siskins ( Chyrsomitris xanthogastra), and a Troupial ( Icterus
icterus). As the latter two species are South American forms they

must have been brought to Guatemala and were not captured there.
With our "live cargo" in tow we proceeded to our boat and made
the short journey back to the steamer at anchor on the end of the pier.
Peter pulled up directly under the prow of the boat, where we were
invisible to the banana loaders on the pier and the deck of the ship.
The large bunches of bananas are loaded on an endless belt conveyor
which transports them from the dock over the boat and down into
the hold. When the inspector on the deck sees an inferior bunch of
fruit it is tossed overboard into the ocean. Unfortunately we happened
to occupy a space of the ocean which was really meant for one of these
rejected bunches of bananas and the result was a boat-load of badly
frightened animals and people, the latter being slightly covered with
litter from the fruit. Fifty-six thousand large bunches of bananas, the
gold of Guatemala, were carried back to New Orleans.
After getting all the birds properly caged with the aid of the ship's
carpenter and leaving them in the care of the butcher, the traditional
animal caretaker on board all ships, we ate dinner and went back to
Barrios, this time on a shopping tour for perfumes and souvenirs of
the country. The large commissary owned and operated by the United
Fruit Co. was a convenient and an easy place to shop, although two
native stores were much more interesting. Shortly before midnight
the Sixaola glided out on the dark blue Carribean bound for New
Orleans and home.
The next Thursday morning when the quarantine doctor boarded
the ship I was very much disappointed to learn that even though
I had a permit to import all the birds and animals I brought along
the two parrots would have to be deported, as I did not have them
in my possession for sixty days. Otherwise they would have to be
quarantined at an expense many times their value. With the rest
of my collection I disembarked and proceeded to the airport on my
journey to Chicago. My short visit to the tropics was over all too
soon and left me with a burning desire to go farther and stay longer
next year.

NIGHTINGALES

By H. Hampe, Brunswick
Although Nightingales have become very scarce or have quite
disappeared in most manufacturing districts, they are still as plentiful
as. ever where their food and living conditions are favourable. In
this district they are found in fair numbers in the big public gardens and
especially in cemeteries. They are not at all shy and will allow them-
selves to be approached without ceasing their song. I was, therefore,
able without much trouble to take several photographs of one while
sitting and when feeding her young ; her nest was on a tombstone
about 2 feet above the ground. The nests are usually found in the
fork of a thick bush at about this heighjt, rarely on the ground.
Unfortunately most nests are destroyed although well hidden, chiefly
by wandering or stray cats, less often by dogs, rats, or other predatory
creatures. A good many are done away with when the parks are
being tidied up. Out of five nests which I found one spring, four were
destroyed, and this was certainly no exceptional proportion.
Once the young leave the nest, which they normally do about
the eleventh day after hatching and earlier if they are disturbed,
they are not so much exposed to danger, for they separate and each
one finds a hiding place, even before they can fly, which is usually
several days after they have left the nest, and if an enemy does discover
one it does not destroy the whole brood.
I have hand-reared several Nightingales from nests which had
been robbed. It is not a difficult task, given fresh ants' eggs and meal-
worms, and they very quickly learnt to feed themselves, and became
extremely tame ; they would perch on my hand, could be picked up
without alarming them, and did not disturb themselves when their
aviary was entered, indeed, one was unfortunately trodden on and
killed by standing behind me as I stepped down off a ladder. I could
carry them about the garden without their attempting to escape.
A mealworm would always entice them back to their flights or cages.
They were very quarrelsome with allied species and near relations,
especially Robins, so much so that they had to be kept apart. They

H. Hampe--Nightingales
did not interfere with other birds, but they are solitary even in the
wild state, for which reason they never become as attached to their
attendant as a Parrot does ; they are not afraid, but take no pleasure in
his company. They prefer to be left alone and are only interested
in their keeper if he brings them a mealworm.
When Nightingales are excited they slowly move their tails up
and down ; once I saw one take up a threatening attitude against
another bird. It spread its tail and wings and pulled out its feathers
like an Owl.
Hand-reared Nightingales sing very little, as the song has to be
learnt, and they have no teacher, consequently their only distinctive
utterances are the alarm and call-notes, and the sississississi with
which a wild Nightingale begins his song.
Newly hatched Nightingales are naked, save for a few thin patches
of down on head and back. Their immature plumage is speckled,
but a moult of the body feathers takes place at three months old when
they assume adult colouring. A full moult takes place every year
after nesting.
Captured Nightingales often fall into premature moult and leave
off: singing if they are suddenly given too many live ants' eggs in spring;
they should be very gradually brought on to this excellent food and
it is as well always to give their usual mixture with it, so that when
the supply of live ants' eggs fails in the autumn there will be no difficulty
in getting the birds to return to the mixture, but as long as live ants'
eggs are obtainable the Nightingale should have its share, the reward
will be more lively song and improved health.
The chief difficulty with Nightingales lies in keeping them in proper
condition. They put on fat in autumn and are apt to lose it too quickly
the following spring ; both states have to be guarded against by careful
feeding, but should a Nightingale become too fat it must not on any
account be rapidly reduced, for it is only too easy to induce " wasting ",
which will increase until the bird dies from weakness. It is not easy
to keep a Nightingale in perfect health and song year in year out,
and a novice should not attempt it; let him gather his experience
on an " easy " bird, such as a Robin or a Blackcap, before he risks the
life of a Nightingale.

NESTING NOTES ON THE &lt;c BAYA WEAVER "

(Ploceus philippinus)
By Leonard C. Webber
Having read the article on Weavers by Mr. Shore-Baily in
Aviculture, vol. i, I would like to add a few remarks on the Baya
Weaver, the champion nest builder of this family.
In October, 1936, I purchased three of these birds, out of colour,
so was not sure if there was a true pair among them. However, within
a week of being installed in the aviary with other Weavers and Whydahs
one was constantly chasing another whenever it chanced to alight near
what later proved to be a hen.
The unlucky cock later gave up the fight for the hen, and the pair
settled down to nesting operations.
The cock has what I imagine to be a courting display, which consists
of a flicking of the wings and tail, with neck stretched, and wings and
tail outspread, the bird adopting a crouched attitude. This happened
every time he alighted near the hen. If the display was not to fascinate
the hen, it must have been to frighten the other cock, it is certainly
a formidable stance, not unlike the actions of the Australian Crimson
Finch.
Nest building commenced in November, the groundwork of the
nest, or rather the overhead work on the wire netting, covered an area
of approximately 2 square feet, the nest proper being hung from as
near the centre as possible of this mass of overhead weaving, and worked
round a single hanging cross perch. A cross piece of this perch was
used for what Mr. Shore-Baily mentions as a strong twist of grass on
which the cock roosts at night.
The strange peculiarity also mentioned re a lump of mud stuck
on each side of the nest was also present, but was pure sand, not mud.
The aviary floor is sand, nothing else being available. (I live close to
one of Sydney's famous beaches.) To me this seems more remarkable,
as sand crumbles and falls away when dry. The saliva if used must
have good sticking qualities.

Material used was white raffia and white manila rope teased,
although a variety of colours was available including green. The
nest was about 2 feet long, the narrow tube entrance being absent;
in its place was an overhanging flap only 4 inches long.
On 20th November I put my hand in the nest and was delighted
to feel an egg. It was dull white, slightly pointed at one end, and large
for the size of the bird, being almost twice the size of the egg of the
Grenadier Weaver (two of which I bred this season), I did not measure
the egg, as I was too frightened to remain near the nest.
On the night of the 22nd, three eggs had been laid (normal clutch
two), and I did not venture near the nest again for fourteen days,
which I thought long enough for them to be hatched, but was dis-
appointed to find only one egg in the nest and no signs of young dead
or alive.
No more eggs have been laid since, although the hen spends most
of her time on or around the nest.
The odd cock never interfered, but amused himself building a
beautiful nest 3 feet away from the other.

The photograph represents a female Cereopsis or Cape Barron
Goose [Cereopsis novas hollandiae) with her week-old brood of two
chicks now being reared at Lilford Hall, Northants.
Natives of Australia and Tasmania, the Cereopsis are true land
birds. They rarely enter the water but graze most persistently on short
turf. For the latter reason, they are essentially birds for the country
dweller, but thrive equally well in an extensive park or moderately
sized grass pen. About equal in size to a domestic Goose ; the plumage
of both sexes is a soft French grey, ornamented on the upper parts by a
few dark heart-shaped spots. The legs are a pinkish red ; the feet
black ; the irregular uniting of the two colours gives the effect of their
having walked in tar.

A remarkable feature, and to which the Cereopsis owes its name, is
the short sharply-pointed bill, almost covered by the yellowish-green
cere. The eye is red.
These birds nest very early in this country, and it is not unusual
for some portion of their lengthy period of incubation to be carried
out whilst the nest is surrounded by snow.

THE MALLARDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97755996" page_id="56322021"  page_num="167" year="" vol="">
By A. F. Moody
Most people are acquainted with the ubiquitous Wild Duck--the
Mallard of our native fens and marshes. Not everyone, however, is
aware that this beautiful green head, the parent of the domestic stock,
encircles the world in about twenty distinct forms or species. Some of
these have never been imported, but as ten species thrive and reproduce
themselves on the ponds at Lilford Hall, Northamptonshire, a few
descriptive notes referring to these may be of interest to aviculturists
and others.
Roughly, they all have the Mallard's voice, habits, form, and struc-
ture. Both sexes also possess beautiful metallic speculums varying
with the species from deep violet in the American to a bright grass
green in the Madagascan bird.
One great difference is that all the various males lack the curled
tail feathers and gorgeous colouring of our English bird. They are,
in fact, just larger and brighter editions of their respective females ;
the bill, legs, and feet, in most cases, being the chief point of difference.
This comparative soberness of dress is responsible for the group not
being very popular with breeders of ornamental waterfowl. To the
ornithologist, however, who combines the two they are intensely
interesting, and, provided they be not allowed to hybridize, are amongst
the most pleasing and hardy of waterfowl.
1. Indian Spotbill (Anas poceilorhyncha ).--A large, grey, black
and white, mottled bird conspicuous by its white outer tertiary wing-
feathers and general pale appearance. Bill black ornamented by a

broad yellow tip and an orange red band across the base. Legs and feet
vivid orange. Egg white.
2. Japanese Spotbill (A. zonorhyncha). -- The Eastern representa-

tive of the last species and known, I believe, between sportsmen in its
native country as the Yellow Nib. Differs from the Indian Spotbill
by being a , smaller and darker bird, also by having no red at the base
of the bill and by the inner web of the white tertiary feathers being
grey. A rare bird until recent years the species is now breeding freely
in collections of waterfowl. Egg like that of the last species but smaller.
3. African Yellow Billed Duck (A. undulata). --A large and
rather pintail shaped bird, most feathers of its dark grey plumage
being edged with paler colour. Bill yellow with a black stripe down
the centre. Legs and feet blackish. A well-known and common bird
in this country.
4. Abyssinian Yellow Billed Duck (A. undulata ruepelli ).--
A smaller and darker variety of the last species. A native of Abyssinia
and differing chiefly by having more chestnut in the plumage and a
more richly coloured bill. A rare bird which is limited to a very few
pairs in England.
5. Black Duck (A. rubripes). -- The Dusky Duck of North America,
and one of the largest and most vigorous of the Mallards. Sides of neck
and cheeks grey. The remainder of the plumage dull black or smoky.
The Wild Duck-like pattern of the female showing through the over-
lying dark colouring in places. Legs and feet red, bill olive. Egg greenish
olive.

<bodyText confidence="0.9571311" page_id="56322022"  page_num="168" year="" vol="">
the Dusky or Black Duck, said to be confined to the Florida peninsula.
Differs in having the neck and cheeks buff, and the overlying dark
plumage replaced by tawny chestnut. Legs and feet orange red. Bill
of male olive yellow. The general appearance of both sexes resembles
a richly marked and tawny female Wild Duck. A rare bird in Europe
which appears to have been absent from England for some years. Has
recently been restarted by three imported pairs and their progeny.
7. Meller's Duck (A. melleri). -- A native of Madagasca and
curiously, in my opinion, more nearly resembles the distant Florida
Duck than its near neighbour the African Yellowbill.

The general colouring of this bird is light chestnut brown with dark
brown centre spots. Head grey streaked with black. The bill, which is
noticeably long, dark olive green. Legs and feet orange red. Egg pale
buff.
Introduced into England some few years ago.
8. Australian Grey Duck (A. superciliosa ).--The common
Wild Duck of Australia and New Zealand. Throat and two superciliary
eye stripes (one below and one above the eye), clear buff. Best of
plumage blackish grey relieved by paler margins to most of the feathers.
Legs and feet stone colour, webs blackish. Bill olive blue. A very
pleasing and hardy bird which is plentiful in England at the present
time.
9. Polynesian Grey Duck (Anas superciliosa var. ?).--A grey
form of the last species. Slightly larger in size, paler in colour and
noticeable by the buff of the head being replaced by grey and the lower
eye stripe being wanting.
10. Black Duck (Anas eparsa ).--Another Mallard which has
already been brought to Europe, but which is extremely rare in
collections of waterfowl is the African Black Duck. This bird is quite
distinct from the American Black Duck. Boughly it has a general dark
grey plumage with, or with indications of, a white neck ring. The
lower back is also ornamented by a sprinkling of white spots. In the
wild state it is said to be of an unsociable disposition and to frequent-
streams in preference to open water. In captivity it does well but
proves quarrelsome.

I felt that a short article on my collection--such as it is--would
not be out of place, as it is some time (I think) since I have seen any
accounts of this nature other than breeding successes (or the reverse).
As regards the latter, I have at present not much room for breeding,
having done what so many people do--that is, crowded up my aviaries

(which are not large ones) with a view to colour. I hope, however,
during the coming season to rectify this. At the head of my collections
comes undoubtedly my Leadbeater " Dawn "--a lovely bird. She is,
I believe, the richest in colouring of any of her species I have ever
seen, and I fancy our Secretary agreed with this when she saw her
some four years ago. Originally bought from a big London dealer,
about whom, perhaps, the least said the better, as I understand he was
largely responsible with his mass importations for the accursed Parrot
Ban, " Dawn " was nevertheless healthy perhaps because she was
at the time the only Leadbeater in the shop, and so had probably not
been imported with a crowd of others. She was, however, very dirty--\0x25A0
grey rather than white on her back, but was delightfully tame. I
remember how she climbed out of her cage on to the shoulder of an
assistant, and then X believe on to mine. This was in 1923, and I had
come up specially from Sussex to town for her. On my return she was
somewhat hurriedly dumped in a cage while I rushed off to " take "
a wedding, but on my return I was able to resume acquaintanceship
with her, and found her tameness had not been impaired by a somewhat
trying journey. This sweetness of disposition only extends, as a rule,
I regret to say, to the male sex--any lady has to make friends with her
very slowly. Personally I find all the Cockatoos far more reliable
and better tempered than Parrots or Lories--both these latter are
subject to " moods " and Parrots such as Greys and Amazons
can be most treacherous. A Cockatoo as a rule lets you know at once
if it is friendly&apos; and then is sometimes almost tediously affectionate.
For some years " Dawn " laid two eggs, which she sat on most devo-
tedly, and her temper was then even with me not of the best, but
we must make allowances in a case of this kind. She has one very
curious habit in very*hot weather, of holding one foot in her water
tin--evidently to cool it ! My only other Cockatoo at present is a nice
hen Roseate. She is not too noisy I am glad to say. How lovely these
birds are in colouring, especially the hens, and what a sight a flock
must be in a state of nature.
Next undoubtedly come my glorious pair of Yellow Mantled or
" Splendid" Kosellas, bred by Lord Tavistock. They won 1st S.P.C.
and cup at Halstead and 1st and S.P.C. at Chelmsford last winter, and

I hope to breed from them--and am reserving an 18 ft. aviary and
shelter for them alone. I was rather annoyed in every show report
to find them described as mere Rosellas. As- someone has pointed out
the hen of this species is almost as brilliant as the cock of the
ordinary one.
I had a terrible tragedy recently, a glorious cock Pennant (to my
mind the most beautiful of all Parrakeets) died in a series of some sort
of convulsions. A pity, as his mate, an Adelaide, now wants another
husband, and I can't hear of one. I want to get a Pennant to see
whether the young come resembling either parent, as in the case of the
Red-headed and Black-headed Gouldians. I believe that some
aviculturists consider P. adelaidse merely a colour form of P. elegans
(surely the older word " Glorious " is even more fitting for this latter
magnificent bird).
Next I will mention my newest acquisition--a Purple-capped
Lory. My former bird escaped after eleven years, and I never saw him
again. This one is rather dull in colouring at present, and has a few
yellowish feathers on breast, apart from the ordinary belt. I hope it
isn't going to turn into a lutino as I don't care for them, especially
in a species whose beauty lies as in the case of P. elegans in its wonderful
ruby colouring. With this bird, I naturally bracket my little Blue
Mountain " Cupid ", of whom more in another article. Apart from
the ubiquitous Budges in all colours, my only other member of the
Parrot family is a lovely cock Plum Head, another bird whose
beauty takes a lot of beating. Follow a mixed collection of Waxbills,
Weavers, a pair of Gouldians (aviary bred), cock Red and hen
Black, Nuns, Javas, Cardinals, a scarlet Tanager, Saffron Finches,
Canaries, and Doves, including the lovely White Fronted Jobi, or
whatever you call it. Certainly not Amethyst, but rather dark
shining magenta in the sunlight--a wonderful colour. I have also a
small aviary of British Finches and Buntings, a fairly comprehensive
collection, but again too crowded for breeding, and here is a secret
for keeping them in perfect health --never give millet, a little of the
small " Indian " may not hurt them, but others, especially the large
white and the red, are fatal to many Goldfinches and Bullfinches,
etc. I used to wonder why I couldn't keep these latter, generally

P. K. Tenner--My Birds
speaking, for any time, when I had them with foreigners (who, of
course, must have millet but not red even then in my opinion),
but when I parted them and fed the British on a mixture more than
half niger and rape with a little canary (almost prohibitive just now
alas), some hemp and sunflower, I was delighted at the change, and
(D.Y.) hope never to lose another. A Chaffinch, of course, will live on
almost anything but I'm sure that millet is bad for the other species
mentioned. Now to Pheasants, of which just now I have only a few.
Headed, of course, by a superb Monaul. I once read in some circus
biography or other of an old showman, I think a German, who used
to collect beautiful horses and every time he bought a new one&apos;
would stand admiring it for hours, stroking its glossy coat, and muttering
at intervals " Oh Lord, how manifold are Thy works ". Well, a cock
Monaul has the same effect on me. How absolutely entrancing are his
rainbow lines--clumsy not a bit, merely stately. So many
people put the Tragopan at the head of the Pheasants--for beauty--
but although handsome enough, to me he is streets behind the Monaul--
surely he is an equally big heavy bird.
I have, of course, the Golden, another magnificent species (imagine
what we should all say if they were imported for the first time !), the
Amherst, and a solitary Silver cock, which has lived loose with the poultry
for three years and roosts in all weathers, about 50 feet up in a big
walnut tree--almost the same branch each night. This species can be
most dangerous, but my present cock is quite quiet, except with my
Golden Polish cock, whom he chases unmercifully, and the two have
to be let out, Polish in morn, Pheasant after the evening feed.
The latter obligingly places himself in his run first thing most mornings
and waits to be shut in !
Lastly I have a very fine two-year-old common Blue Peacock--a more
beautiful species to me than the much lauded Javan or Green,
which lacks, of course, the adorable blue on the breast and neck of
the other. This is a somewhat rambling account, given for what it is
worth. Oh that I may be able to record the breeding of Splendid
Rosellas and Gouldians later in the year !

Winter is an excellent time to visit the bird-houses at the Brookfield
Zoo, the popular name of the Chicago Zoological Park, for most of the
birds are easily seen in their winter quarters and all are in fine plumage,
though there are a few exceptions where the " eclipse " plumage is
in evidence. Probably an inspection from cage to cage will be interesting.
Entering from the south gate the first bird building we come to is the
Perching-bird House. It is a large white building with a pretentious
fa 9 ade and is the centre one of three situated on a stone terrace over-
looking the magnificent formal pool. Inside there is a large central
hall flanked at each end by a broad passage and all the walls are lined
with wall cages, sixty-three in number and varying from 42 inches in
width up to the large community cages 12 feet across. The backgrounds
are painted a delicate shade of pale blue and natural branches arranged
so far as is possible for practicability in an artistic manner are used
rather than the plain wooden perches. In the centre is a good sized
flying-cage, 12 by 21 feet, to accommodate some of the larger birds,
Magpies, Jays, etc. The south end of the building is devoted to the South
American varieties. So far as is possible we have the birds arranged
geographically---of course it is not always practicable to do this because
of the arrangement of the cages, as they are grouped according to size.
The first birds noticed will be the Toucans. These grotesque birds are
probably well known to every one interested in birds, at least by
reputation, for their huge, brilliantly-coloured beaks compel notice.
At present we have four varieties, the larger Toco, with a beak of vivid
orange and scarlet tipped with an oval black spot, the Bed-billed whose
beak is mostly crimson shading to black at the end and with greenish-
yellow ridge and base, the Ariel and the Sulphur and White breasted,
both with jet black bills, the base in the former yellow and in the latter
pale blue. All have the general colour deep black but in the Toco and

the Red-billed the throats and breasts are white while the Ariel has
this same region rich orange and the Sulphur and White breasted has it
white overlaid with rich yellow. These birds are all attractively tame
and their loud yelping notes are often heard. Then comes the Cock of the
Rock, flamboyant in its coat of radiant orange. The depth of tint on this
bird is indescribable, suffice to say it actually glows. The peculiar flat,
lateral crest can be brought down to completely conceal the yellow bill.
The female has a smaller crest and is entirely coffee-brown in colour.
A very rare specimen in zoo collections is the Imperial Ant-Pitta.
In shape it is like a typical Pitta but entirely different in colour, being
shades of earth-brown varied with buff and black in delicate markings.
It is quite amusing with its globular body (no tail) and long legs.
Adjoining it is a fine Brazilian Motmot, a great pet which really likes
to play. Its colour is rich green suffused on the under parts with russet
and shading to blue on wings and long tail which it regularly swings
and trims according to the custom of all Motmots. The head is gorgeous
with markings of turquoise and ultramarine varied with velvety black.
In this same section are the winter quarters of various Doves and
Pigeons which have outdoor aviaries in summer. We have three
varieties of the magnificent Crowned Pigeons, the Common, Sclater's, and
Victoria. Our collection of Doves and gallinaceous birds is far from
complete as their building and runs are not yet ready. We have the
Bleeding-heart, Speckled, Wonga-Wonga, Nicobar, White-crowned,
White-bellied, Ruddy Quail-Dove, Tambourine, Blue-spotted, Diamond,
Australian, and Indian Green-winged Doves, etc.
So far as is possible we try to have the birds in this building grouped
geographically though it does not always work, out so. In the North
American division are several Hawks and Owls temporarily installed
because the outside quarters are not yet ready for them. A European
Kestrel shares a cage with several of the beautiful little Sparrow Hawks
and a Great Horned Owl and a Barn Owl live amicably together. A
Short-eared Owl is in an adjoining cage. White-necked Ravens from
Western North America and the Common Crow are part of the American
collection. The Raven is a small species, Corvus cryjptoleucus, no larger
than the Crow and named " White-necked " because the bases of the
neck feathers are white. One wonders at the application of this for a

beautiful Mountain Bluebird, which is blue all over, cerulean above and
turquoise below, and the Western Bluebird, differing from the Eastern
Bluebird in having the head and throat blue. Two American Robins
and a Brown Thrasher share a cage. One of the Robins is a pure albino
with yellow bill and lege and just the faintest rosy tinge on the breast,
a lovely bird. When Mr. Delacour was here last fall he remarked that
it would pass very well as an albino English Blackbird. Our collection
has been enlarged to great advantage by the addition of several rare
species which he brought for us and I understand that he was able to
take back with him over 100 specimens of our native species. Many
of them were from the West Coast, which has very attractive varieties
particularly desirable from the aviculturist's viewpoint, and I trust
he was successful in landing them. So many of them are unknown
to us in the East or Middle West and the acquisition of such species is
as much appreciated as those from any other part of the world. To come
back to our American collection : we have that prince of singers the
Hermit Thrush, whose purity of tone is unrivalled, also his close relative,
the Olive-backed Thrush, but little inferior as a singer. Both of these
species sing up to July, starting in April, though the latter may be
heard as late as September. As these Thrushes usually only sing during
their breeding season in the north woods hundreds of miles from
Chicago it is a rare treat to hear them sing in captivity. Among our
Blue Jays is one that whistles tunes much in the manner of a small bird.
The Rose-breasted Grosbeak and his Western cousin, the Black-headed
Grosbeak, add beauty and melody, as does Vigor's Grosbeak from
Mexico. He is a gorgeous creature in brilliant orange yellow and we
often hear his liquid whistling note. There is another cage of native
Sparrows---the White-throat, White-crowned, Harris, and Fox. All
with musical voices. A very large wall cage houses a great variety
embracing the American Scarlet Tanager, the Western Tanager---a
beauty in black and yellow with a crimson head, and many varieties of
the daintiest of American birds, the Wood-Warblers. To mention a few
there are : Magnolia, Lutescent, Chestnut-sided, the beautiful Redstart,
which I am sure would be appreciated by European aviculturists ;
it is an exquisite creature in jet black and snow white varied with

salmon pink. Then we have the largest of all the warblers, the Yellow-
breasted Chat. It is an olive-green bird with a rich orange-yellow breast.
About 7 inches long it far exceeds the average warbler in size. Among

the other native birds in this cage is the quaint Wren-Tit, limited in
territory to the coast of California and extending up into Oregon. It
combines characters of the Wren and the Tit-mouse with the appearance
of the former. In its native habitat it is most elusive, more often heard
than seen, and its ringing call is a feature of its native brush. Sharing
this cage are a number of tropical foreign birds, New Zealand White-
eyes, several pairs of Painted Quail, a Bed-crested Finch, and a number
of tropical Tanagers, the Black, Blue, Maroon, Brazilian Scarlet, Black-
cheeked, Emerald, Violet, Blue-capped, and Green. Also a fine European
Waxwing. Africa is represented in the wall cages by Emperor and Tri-
coloured Starlings, Giant, Paradise, Bed-shouldered, and Shaft-tailed
Whydahs, Baya, Orange, Napoleon, and Bufous-necked Weavers,
Blue-naped and White-cheeked Colies, Melba, Cut-throat and Grey
and Green Singing Finches, Yellow Sparrows, and a cage of European
Goldfinches. There is also an assortment of Canaries.
Asia offers many brilliant ones, including the Green Hunting-Crow
whose plumage varies according to season, sometimes pale apple-green
or light turquoise varied with mahogany brown and black and all set off
by the vermilion bill and feet. It is one of the loveliest of birds. Then
come Blue-cheeked and Fire-tufted Barbets, Orange-bellied and Gold-
fronted Bulbuls, Fairy Bluebirds glorious in enamelled cerulean blue
and velvet black, Scimitar Babbler, Spectacle and Shama Thrushes,
the Chinese Dayal Bird, and Mynahs. Australia and New Guinea present
the Noisy and Macklot's Pittas, though why the former is called the
" noisy " Pitta seems to have no reason as it is a very quiet bird and only
occasionally do we hear its three-syllabled whistle, far from unpleasant;
Spiny-cheeked Honey-eater (Tawny Frogmouth), which lives mainly
on a diet of mice, usually hand-fed, but feeds familiarly from
the fingers when grub-worms and meal-worms are proffered ;
Hemprich Hornbill, and the ungainly Ground Hornbills, three
Lesser Birds of Paradise, two cocks and a hen, and the very desir-
able Sickle-billed Bird of Paradise. This bird at first glance appears very
sombre, as it seems to be entirely black. But it is varied with most

brilliant green and bine reflections and splendidly plumed. It has a
very long tail, over 24 inches, which has its velvety black surface
silvered with rich blue and a long decurved beak which when open
shows the pale yellow lining of the mouth and throat. Over each
shoulder is a fan-shaped arrangement of black feathers barred with blue
and green and the short smoky flank plumes are edged with lustrous
purple. It is a rara avis indeed, for only six were imported from New
Guinea and the other five are in England or France. The beautiful
Regent Bird from Australia is also in this group. Another of the large
wall cages has a fine collection of the Australian Finches. All but two
of the known species are represented. These include the Painted,
Crimson, Red-eared, Diamond, Common and Heck's Longtail, Parson,
Red and Black-headed Gouldian, Bichenow's, Blue-headed Parrot
Finch, Star, Plum-head, Chestnut-breasted, Pectoral, Yellow-rumped
and Masked Grassfinches. A White-eyed Crow is also part of the
Australian group.
In the centre of the room is a large flying-cage 12 by 21 feet. In
it we see Green Catbirds from Australia whose cry is unpleasantly like
the yowl of a tom-cat. Satin Bower Birds play all day with twigs but
never build any bowers, the male of this species is glossy blue black
and the female dull green and brown. Both have pale purplish eyes.
There are three Piping Crows, two of which are females, and one of these
is very accommodating in responding to any visitor's whistle. The
male indulges occasionally in his liquid gurgling. One of the Javan
Mynahs has perfected an imitation of the whistling of these birds besides
being able to carry on a conversation with anyone who stops to talk
to it. The Tree-pies are noticeable for their activity and long graceful
tails. They are attractive in deep blue with black chests and are known
as the Formosa Blue Magpie. We also have the Red-billed Tree-pie
and the Wandering Tree-pie, unusual in his smoky-brown tones. A
large Purple Jay, two fine Black and Yellow Orioles ( Gymnomystax ),
Laughing Thrush, Starlings, native Grackles, Kookaburras, and a fine
pair of King Parrots complete the assemblage in this cage to which
other varieties will be added from time to time. The King Parrots are
really aliens to this cage as we have a building devoted to the Parrot-
like birds--but there was no aviary large enough in their own building

so we have them her# where their gorgeous colouring attracts much
notice.
Before leaving the Perching-bird House mention must be made of
the plate-glass cage built for the Humming-birds. Eight species are
represented, Allen's, Anna's, Gilt-crest, Ruby, and Topaz, two species
of the Sapphire, and two species of the Emerald. This attractive exhibit
is very popular with the visitors. The cage is 13 feet across by 8 feet
high and deep and is planted with bamboo and an ass ortment of
flowering vines which impart a tropical jungle effect. The several food
bottles are hung in various locations so as to give the birds a choice
of feeding places. A mist-like spray is turned on once a day during the
winter months ; we found it best to watch during this time as the
birds sometimes became water-logged and could not rise again. The
temperature is maintained at 80*. While they require a strong light
to show up their brilliant refulgence their feeding bottles are placed
at eye level so if the spectator has any patience at all sooner or later
one of these gems will flash in front of him and display his glittering
gorget or crest. These tiny creatures display great skill in capturing
the infinitesimal fruit-flies which we release in the cage. While their
needs are great comparatively, an aviary of these feathered gems is well
worth while judging from the enthusiasm shown by the public, which
after all is the criterion.

Mr. Gr. Notini, the inventor and patentee of these nest-boxes, has
asked that they may be described in the Avicultural Magazine.
He claims for them that they are practically indestructible by vermin
or weather, and that small birds accept them readily particularly
Tits and Flycatchers. They can, of course, be painted any colour
that is desired and are made in several sizes and have been tested and
approved by both private concerns and official institutions in Sweden.
I am also informed that a Scottish gentleman who saw the boxes in
use in Sweden bought a large consignment for his own estate and is
well satisfied with the result.
Appended is a summary of trials on an Experimental Estate kindly
sent by the Swedish Chamber of Commerce, 14 Trinity Square, London,
E.C. 3, to whom inquiries for or about these nesting-boxes should be
addressed.

During the whole of the trial period 88 breedings out of 135 possible
in Alsten sheet boxes for Tits were successful, which corresponds to an
average nesting of 65*2 per cent.
Of the broods, 6-8 per cent were entire failures, whilst in 13-6 per
cent of the boxes were found partial failures in respect of eggs and
broods.
The number of breedings with adverse results amounted to 18 or
20-4 per cent. Of the total number of breedings in the Ringius boxes
of the same sizes 56 breedings took place out of 108 possible which gives
an average inhabitation of 52 per cent. Complete failure occurred in

3*6 per cent of the total breedings whilst 16-1 per cent of the breedings
were partial failures.
The total number of wholly and partially spoiled eggs or broods
was 11 or 19*6 per cent.
Of the total breedings on the Ahlby estate 28 Alsten boxes were set
up in the spring of 1934 of which 24 were intended for Tits and the rest
for Starlings. The boxes were placed mainly in the orchards and nearby
parks with fairly old trees.
The analyses of the boxes were made at the same time and in the
same manner as at Experimentalfaltet, the only difference being that
the extra investigation relative to more than one annual occupation
was not effected here. During the trial period nesting has increased
from 58 per cent in the summer of 1934, to 75 per cent in 1935,
whilst it fell again in 1936 to 66 per cent. The reason for the drop last
summer is probably to be found in the fact that a number of boxes
were occupied by bumble-bees which may have prevented the Tits
from entering. In the case of the boxes 110 and 126 the birds were
kept at a distance by two families of Owls which occupied the same
tree. In the boxes intended for the Tits 48 breedings out of 72 possible
have taken place during the three trial years making a frequency of
66-6 per cent. The mortality among the broods has amounted to three
entirely destroyed sets of eggs of Flycatchers and one partially of
Great Tits' and Flycatchers' eggs. Complete failure has thus occurred
in 6*3 per cent of the total breeding.

A year ago Monsieur Delacour kindly sent Mr. Spedan Lewis a
young pair of these rare Cranes. At first sight they were rather dis-
appointing, for their plumage was a somewhat dull brown and their
red caps not nearly as bright as they subsequently became. They
were very tame from the first, would feed from hand and allow them-
selves to be stroked, arching their necks and uttering a low rather
booming note meanwhile. After their moult they assumed adult
plumage and are extremely beautiful. Their feathers are like grey
watered silk, they lie so smoothly and the red on their heads is deep
and glowing. They have a curious habit of picking up a wisp of grass
and wiping themselves down with it. Monsieur Delacour told us that
his pair had found a patch of yellow clay in their paddock and quite
spoilt their appearance by daubing themselves all over with it. Our

birds " danced " much more, at least the male did. At that time he was
inclined to chase and tease the hen and she seemed rather afraid of him
so when they were taken in at night she was given a separate compart-
ment.
Both birds, but the male especially, are much more clamorous
and " honk " very loudly, the male became rather aggressive as time
went on but nothing serious. The yard they inhabit by day is infested
with rats and now and then they caught one and drowned it in the bath.
They are given dog biscuit soaked and a little raw meat every day or
a handful of mealworm beetles with whatever insects they can find.
About the third week in April they began to show signs of wanting
to nest; both of them wandered about collecting bits of reed and grass,
arranging them here and there, but nothing really serious happened
until the 3rd May, when the first egg was laid, followed two days
later by another one. They are greenish-white, with spots on the
big end ; both birds incubate them in turn. They are very noisy
and their call can be heard more than a mile away across the water.
The male attacks everybody who comes into the paddock with great
fury. We are told that incubation lasts forty to forty-five days, and
when chicks appear the family must be penned into a small enclosure
to prevent the old birds from walking their chicks to death. This is
believed to be the first attempt at breeding these Cranes in Britain, if
not in Europe, so we naturally are very anxious it should be successful.

This month I feel sure readers would like to be told of the new
birds brought home by two very successful and well-known collectors,
Mr. Shaw Mayer, and Mr. C. S. Webb.
First to arrive late in April was Mr. Shaw Mayer, with a magnificent
collection of Birds of Paradise, but as usual extremely modest and
hoping to bring far rarer and better birds next time !
His main object of this expedition was to bring home the Orange
Wattled Bird of Paradise (Macgregoua jpulchra), and the Helense

182 N. Wharton-Tigar--Notes from the London Zoo
Six-plumed, Parotia helenae. To get these he had to get to the mountains
at the head of the Waria River, South-East New Guinea ; this entailed
chartering a plane for the first 100 miles and then a two daj^'s journey
to the higher mountains where at 8,000 feet these birds are found. The
Orange Wattled Bird of Paradise is extremely rare and only two
specimens were obtained, one dead which was skinned and brought
home and one very fine male now in the Zoo--a glorious thing and
everyone who can should make a point of seeing it.
The Helense Six-plumed is similar to Lawes but has old gold
colour above the beak, instead of silver white, and on this account
is perhaps a little less attractive. The six males and one female
all arrived in fine condition. I may mention that this variety is
found only in a very small area. I hear that the natives in this high
mountain district are quite detestable, a crafty, savage, and primitive
people, indulging in revolting orgies ; in fact, Mr. Shaw Mayer was quite
glad when the time came to leave them.
Besides the two above-named Birds of Paradise, never brought
alive to this country before, he brought some very perfect specimens
of the Lesser Supurb ( Lophouria superba latipennis), Princess Stephanie's
Bird of Paradise (Astrapia stephaniae), Mayers Sickle-billed Bird of
Paradise ( Epimachus meyen), a young Rifle Bird ( Plilorhis magnified),
a few of the very beautiful Hunsteins Magnificent Bird of Paradise
(.Biphyllodes magnificus hunsteini), differing from the ordinary form
in having the back a glorious deep orange, and he again brought one
male Empress of Germany's Bird of Paradise ( Paradisaea augustae-
victoriae), the only other specimen brought in 1931 is still in fine con-
dition at the Zoo where he often delights us by his fine display.
Another interesting though not so beautiful bird brought was the
Gardener Bower Bird ( Amblyornis inornatus). This species of Gardener
Bird builds a circle wall of sticks with a centre column and lines the
floor with moss, the two males and one female are all in the Zoo.
There was also a very tame Fawn-breasted Bower-Bird ( Chamy -
dera cerviniventris), a hand reared large Wood Swallow ( Artamus
maximus), a Large-eyed Honeyeater (Melidictes torquata) , three absolutely
new varieties of Munias, some pairs of Goodfellows Parrot Finch,
a very large variety of the well-known Blue-faced Parrot Finch,

but more brilliant in colour and coming from such a high
altitude it should be extremely hardy. And finally some beautiful
specimens of the New Guinea Green-winged Parrot (Alisterus chloro-
pterus), and a charming small Owl (species ?). On 10th May, Mr. Webb
and his niece arrived at the Zoo from the Gold Coast with a wonderful
collection. As the list of the birds he brought was published last month
in the Magazine, I will comment only on a few. The Sunbirds are
glorious, there is a Superb ( Cynnyris superhus), perhaps a little smaller
than those brought before, several Splendids (C. coccinigastu) --really
lovely, one specimen especially was a shimmering streak all colours of
the rainbow, the Coppery (C. cupreus), another tiny metallic beauty.
Another gem is the Carmelite Sunbird ( Chalcomitra fuliginosus) --a
most attractive variety, then there are examples of the Beautiful
Nectarinia pulchella and many other lovely species.
Among many other birds I admired the tiny Tinker Birds, two
varieties in yellow and black. Several varieties of Kingfishers were
brought over in superb condition, including another pair of the Pigmy
Kingfishers we so admired two years ago.
The two new varieties of Bobin Chats are marvellous, larger than
any seen before and sing beautifully. The Wattle-eyed Flycatchers are
very attractive with coloured eye rims which stand out and so are the
Paradise Flycatchers. There are some fine Touracoes, several Owls,
and an engaging and very beautiful little Cookoo and a very rare pair
of Bed-headed Fantee Parrots ( Poicephalus gulielmi fantiensis).
Altogether a collection to be proud of and worth going far to see.
Both Mr. Shaw Mayer and Mr. 0. S. Webb are well-known for the
wonderful condition in which they manage to land their birds. Many
of them could go straight on the show bench. The Owls are Fraser's
Eagle Owl, a pair of Woodford's Wood Owl, still in down, and a delight-
ful pair of Pearl-spotted Pigmy Owls.

This Society and, indeed, all bird lovers have sustained a great
loss in the death on Coronation Day of the Hon. Mrs. Henry Broughton.
She was formerly a member of the Council and was most anxious
to do all she could to encourage and help towards the keeping of birds
under ideal conditions.
Very young in years, a great lover of Nature and all things beautiful,
she was richly endowed with great beauty, and charm, as well as
character and brains. She showed genius in her handling of birds ;
I can picture her now, a lovely figure sitting on a tree stump, in her
large tropical glass aviary, surrounded by wonderful birds, calling
each in turn. First a King Bird of Paradise would perch on her hand,
followed by a Niltava, a tame Shama, various Sunbirds, then an
exquisite Princess Stephanie Bird of Paradise with streamers flying
and characteristic rustle would hop close to her head asking to be
remembered. All were quite at home under her magic. The Society
tender their deepest sympathy to her sorrowing husband, her relatives,
and to her many friends. She leaves a little son, too young to under-
stand his great loss.
CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, ETC.
Madam, -- I notice that Mrs. Wharton-Tigar describes the Musky Lorikeet
as " extremely delicate and hard to keep ". I did not have any trouble
with two birds of this species I kept for a considerable time in a movable
aviary, feeding them on the usual Lorikeet diet, Dr. Allinson's Food, and fruit,
I eventually parted with them, as they were both males and I could not
secure a female.
An Australian aviculturalist, I believe, has bred the species fairly freely.

PS.--I hope it will be something much smaller than the O.P.S. Pheasant,,
but whatever it is, let it be plain and good.
Madam, --You may be interested to hear that British Glues and
Chemicals, Ltd., recently wrote to me saying they had had applications for
samples of the Iodized Mineral Salts from many parts of the world since
my article appeared in the Avicultural Magazine last July. One applica-
tion is from the South Sea Islands.
Roughly speaking they have had forty letters from the United Kingdom
and some half dozen or more from all parts of the world. Our Magazine is
indeed widely read. I can vouch for this from the enormous number of letters
I received after my first article on Gouldians in 1932. I can truthfully say
I had letters from all over the world including such remote places as Alaska.
I have no interest in the firm and my only desire is to help other aviculturists r

Adventures in Bird Protection. By Thomas Gilbert Pearson.
Illustrated. Published by D. Appleton-Century Company, Inc.,.
New York and London. 15s.
This book chronicles the passage of bird protective laws, and
formation of an Audubon Society in North Carolina in 1901 by William
Dutcher, Chairman of the Committee on Bird Protection of the American
Ornithologists' Union, and the organization four years later of the
National Association of Audubon Societies with T. Gilbert Pearson,
writer of this book, as Secretary. On this foundation Pearson, during
the succeeding quarter of a century, built up a structure which exceeds
that of any similar institution in the world, besides stimulating interest
in organized bird protection in more than a score of foreign countries.
It is a long book, over 400 closely printed pages, but intensely
interesting, and no bird lover would not read it with avidity from
beginning to end. That bird protection was an urgent necessity is
obvious from the accounts of wanton destruction and horrible cruelty
which were rife throughout the state, where every boy had a gun and

shot at practically every bird he saw ; not only with the connivance
but the approval of the adult community, who in their turn massacred
entire colonies of breeding birds for the millinery trade, leaving the
young to die of starvation or be eaten alive by ants. The fight against
cupidity, greed, and thoughtless cruelty was long and stern, as Mr. Pear-
son remarks, " something would have been amiss if it &apos;were not, I have
never known an important bird protection bill that was not bitterly
fought 55 .
The world traffic in feather millinery reached its height between
1870 and 1908 and the quantities of plumage used during these years
was beyond calculation. "As an example, in an auction room in London,
where great sales took place monthly there was displayed in June, 1900,
in one lot, white egret plumes that had cost the lives of more than
24,000 birds."
Mr. Pearson was eight times elected as Chairman of the International
Committee for Bird Preservation. In December, 1936, this Committee
consisted of 219 members, representing 138 leading scientific and wild
life conservation organizations that compose the National sections in
twenty-seven nations.
The Committee, in Continental Europe, as aviculturists know, has
the constant co-operation of M. Delacour among others, and that office
is actively sounding public sentiment in European countries on the
advisability of adopting a new European international treaty for bird
protection to include North Africa.
Mr. Pearson is one of those fortunate people who are privileged
to see the result of their life work before they die. He has written
modestly of his own part and given full credit to Mr. Butcher and
other labourers in the same field, but no one can read his book, and
it is to be hoped that a great many people will, and fail to be impressed
by his whole-hearted enthusiasm for the cause he has made his own.
He was the son of poor Quaker parents, brought up in the country,
where he collected birds 5 eggs, and gained that knowledge of birds
which he afterwards turned to such good account. Few books came
his way and those few were obtained by hard work and self-denial,
which met with little encouragement.

According to Robinson's Birds of the Malay Peninsula this Fruit-

bution includes the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Rhio Archipelago,
Billiton, Borneo and North Natuna Islands.
It is found chiefly in forested country from sea-level to over 3,000
feet.
The bird here shown is a cock, the hen is similar but with yellow
throat and yellow rim round the eye, hence the name Zosterops ; the
beak in the hen is brown.
It is a comparatively large species--as a cage bird it is absolutely
delightful, very tame, full of character, and has the ability to mimic
any other bird.

The bird here shown is a cock, the hen is similar, but has no black
throat and the head is strongly washed with bronzy yellow, but has
no pale yellow on forehead, and sides of the head--the beak is brown.
This most lovely little bird is not too easy to keep in good condition--
it has a chattering and rather shrill note which it utters when nervous
or alarmed, but I have heard it sing a very sweet song. It is very
rare in captivity.

THE MISTY BEGINNING--EVOLUTION AND DISTRIBUTION--
ALWAYS OF TERRESTRIAL HABIT?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999060684210526" page_id="56322060"  page_num="188" year="" vol="">
Given the choice of a day to be lived in the world of yesteryear*
when the first systems of complex life cells had left the seas and were
adapting themselves to Land, or a sojourn to see what the world be
like in the to-morrow of a million years, then to return to present-day
life ... I would ask to go to the Past, if only to see and wonder at
the plasmodic beginnings of birds.
The scientists have pulled aside the curtains of the Past so that
we can look back, but the mists of time still and always blur the vision,,
so that we shall always be without the real story of how birds began..
Reptilian in appearance they no doubt were, and, in the first instance,,
featherless and flightless. Then, possibly, they learnt to glide, and then,,
bat-like, to fly on web-skinned forelegs.
From some such creatures, our beautiful Pheasants have evolved,,
and when one considers the many different species of Pheasants, the
marvel of it all is truly bewildering.
Whatever their early beginning may have been, it would seem,
that the species--distinct as they may be as a group--can reasonably
be connected up with other groups, and one can very well visualize
the changes brought by time that have created species out of a group.

of possibly one or two distinct members--the stock from which the
species branched out. This is no strictly ornithological treatise, but is
simply what appears to me to be, prima facie, a reasonable connecting
up of the Pheasant tribe.
From one Stock
I assume that the Pheasant group sprang from the same beginning,
as they are confined to Asia, and there does not appear to be any
evidence that they ever existed in the New World. It is probable
that the Pheasants proper were restricted to Asia in the region of the
Caspian Sea millions of years ago, and that their range extended later
to the British Isles, and also that there was a wholesale migration
eastwards. Phasianus colchicus which I think was the original stock
from which the varieties of the species Phasianus colchicus and
Phasianus collectively evolved, in those early days spread in bands
and occupied lands from England, across the Channel (then marsh-
land) and on through France, the Caucasus, across to Mongolia, China,

and Japan--for the Sea of Japan would then be but a vast inland
lake, and the Yellow Sea and the Korea Strait would be low-lying
ground.
P. colchicus still ranges the region of the Caucasus, and, widely
distributed as the species are, the varieties of the species phasianus
have still much in common, being not only structurally alike, but
alike, too, in habits. The encroachment of the seas which gradually
filled up the marshes and saltings, causing lands to become islands,
and the various climatic changes which the world underwent through
the ages segregated the birds and restricted their range, and changes
took place. Environment alone--a mighty factor--gradually modelled
them to their new conditions of life, and coupled with much inter-
breeding, in some cases, and crossing of blood, the varieties became
distinct in their differences. Plumage underwent changes--exactly
why it is hard to tell, but the puzzle of plumage is always a matter of
wonder, and it is difficult to find a satisfactory explanation for the
sometimes highly specialized feathering of birds.
Power of Flight
Pheasants--the large and varied group of them--are poor on the
wing. We can say of some of them that they are fast flyers, but their
progress through the air might better be described as gliding or para-
chuting. An initial rush of wings to take them up, and then they take
advantage of wind and slope to allow gravitation to give them speed.
The Dodo lost its power of flight and became extinct--man exter-
minated it--but I doubt whether Pheasants ever had the power of real
flight, and am inclined to the view that they have always been of
terrestrial habit. Some Pheasants are becoming scarce, if not extinct.
This unpleasant fact is not due to atrophied wings, but to the fact that
vast tracts of land have been brought into cultivation, and the advance
of civilization in the once almost impenetrable fastnesses has destroyed
the sanctuaries of many species. Where the natives once matched
cunning against wariness to trap an occasional bird, they have since
made use of wholesale methods of catching--the incentive being the
white man's trade in the birds for the sake, in many cases, of the feathers
for millinery and decorative wants. Nowadays the natives have

firearms to use against them, and white " sportsmen " find pleasure
in hunting down and shooting rare birds. In this connection, flight
is the undoing of pheasants.
It is possible that Pheasants are only beginning (measured in terms
of thousands of years) to learn to fly. It is likely that their earlier
enemies were aerial ones, mainly, though they have many terrestrial
ones. They are surely a match for the latter of these, as they can slip
away like shadows--melting into nothingness, be it over a barren
plain, rocky ground, or forest land. True, they will fly up if suddenly
frightened, but they do so, generally, with so much voluble protest
and noise that one might be pardoned for concluding that it is a newer
form of progression, rather than a temporary reversion to their original
manner of escape.
If a deep-rooted instinct prompted them to rise at sudden danger
would not that same instinct silence them as they obeyed the urge of
their almost forgotten capabilities ? Compare this with the silence
and swift stealth by which they speed to safety under cover of boulder,
fern, or herbage generally ; taking advantage of every possible cover
with the same infallibility as if they had prearranged the course to
be taken, with minute detail.
These remarks do not apply to all Pheasants, but then, are all
Pheasants in fact Pheasants ?
The Great Linking-up
True Pheasant--the group known as Phasianus --and the Golden
Pheasants-- Chrysolophus pictus, and C. amher sties ; the Cheer, Catreus
wallichii --whose peculiar environment alone may account for its being
so dissimilar from any other group in its call, eggs, etc.--and the group
Syrmaticus ; may well be sprung from a closely related, or identical
stock. In one direction we have the Blood Pheasants, Tragopans, and
Impeyans ; Crossoptilons (Eared-Pheasants), and then the Swinhoe
and other Kaleeges, which can be linked with the Junglefowl (and so to
our domestic poultry) by no great stretch of the imagination.
In another direction we have that curious group of Pheasants
Polyplectron --the Peacock Pheasants--which form a link with Pigeons.
A group of two species Chalcurus, the Bronze-tailed Peacock Pheasants,

link up the Polyplectrons with the other Pheasant groups, but the
Polyplectrons themselves surely begin where Pigeons end. They bill
feed their young ; their eggs, number and type, nesting and general
habits are akin in so many ways to those of Pigeons that one wonders
at the fine dividing line.

The Peacock Pheasants are but glorified Pigeons, and from the
Ground-Pigeons it is but a step to the widespread Quail family. The
Quails again lead us back to the Pheasant tribe by way of the Blood
Pheasants which live in the snows of the Himalayan peaks. Virtually
on top of the World ; and looking down from them and their habitat,
we see the stocky Impeyan Lophophorus, living jewels of scintillating,
burnished plumage. Living at high elevation the Cheer Pheasant is
to be found. Westward are the Koklass Pucrasia, and, from the heights
which run as the backbone of India into Tibet and North-West China,
we meet the genus Chrysolophus --Golden and Lady Amhersts. In
Tibet and Manchuria, the strange Crossoptilons, with their long,
upswept ear feathers and barb-like tail coverts. China is the home of
the Silver Pheasant of the Kaleege group. Temper and battle seems to
be in the make-up of all the Kaleeges, another fiery example of which
is the handsome Swinhoe, confined to the Isle of Formosa.
In Japan we find the Copper Pheasants, and the Japanese Versicolor,
the most Eastward member of the group Phasianus, whose blood
mingles in the veins of Colchicus in this country of ours. P. versicolor
in the East, P. colchicus in the West; the genus ranges from the Atlantic
to the Pacific.
Beebe, in the beautiful language typical of all his writings, and
particularly so of Pheasants, Their Lives and Homes, makes us realize
the widespread nature of the group of true Pheasants, when he says
" Their habits are much alike, although they are widely distributed
. . . there is little difference between Colchicus, which ranges the
Caucasus along the eastern shore of the Black Sea, and the Versicolor,

the sound of whose challenge mingles with the boom of the Pacific
breakers, pounding on the Japanese coast, fifty-five hundred miles
to the Eastward. . .
To the South, the islands and peninsulas that remain washed by
the seas that cover the lost continent of Australasia are the homes of
more Pheasants. Of these, the Argus Pheasants are a striking example
of the strange modelling hands of Environment; the long, soft feathers,
which impart such a grotesque appearance are doubtless a means of
deceiving its enemies. How many animals, I wonder, have sunk claw
or tooth into feather, instead of flesh, while the Argus made good its
escape, minus a deal of plumage, but otherwise unharmed. Although
the genus display with their extraordinary wings during courtship,
it is likely that the fundamental object of their exceptionally long
feathers is to foil their hunters.
To the South, too, we find Eirebacks, Peacock Pheasants---in
Sumatra and Borneo.
The Future of Pheasants
Eminent authorities have told us that some species may become
extinct. In any case, some are certainly very rare, and it must there-
fore be a source of gratification to every aviculturist to learn of the
efforts of the Ornamental Pheasant Society to import several rare
species under expert persons.
I like to hear the crack of the guns in this country when the autumn
surrenders a proportion of its fine grown birds, for the crack of those guns
spells a deep assurance of the continuation of our Phasianus. Far
different must sound the reports of the guns of the hunters of the rare
Pheasants in other lands.
It may be that some day there will be a great awakening to the
tragedy of the grand species that are falling under the advance of civiliza-
tion and industry in their native homes, and efforts will be made to
preserve them.
There are hundreds of grand parks and private grounds in the land
which would be the richer by the introduction of Ornamental Pheasants,
and there is no reason at all why even the rarest of species should not
be as familiar in England as that already adopted member of the

and parcel of all that typifies England and English homesteads. For
nearly all the Ornamental Pheasants can vie with the Peacock in
beautiful plumage, in courtship display, in carriage, and in poise.

One so often hears new arrivals to Singapore express disappointment
and surprise at not seeing immediately the brilliantly plumaged birds
flying about usually associated with the tropics. This idea has been
formed, no doubt, by visits to museums where all the glories of the
tropics are more or less lumped together, and they are apt to think
that all birds out here must be brightly coloured. Naturalists, of
course, know that this is not the case, as all tropical countries have
many dull-coloured ones also, Malaya being no exception to the rule.
While some, such as Pittas, Sunbirds, Fairy Bluebirds, and Broad-
bills are exceptionally gaudy, others have eccentric forms like the
Hornbills and some Pheasants, but these have to be sought nowadays
in the jungles and one cannot expect to meet with them immediately on
landing. I am sure if any of these birds put in an appearance about
Singapore they would quickly be captured or shot, the same as any
rare species is at home, in spite of all laws to the contrary. Still, there
are many interesting birds to be found right in the heart of Singapore,
and still many more in the gardens and suburbs if one knows where
and how to look for them, and it is with this object in view that I
propose to make a few observations which may be helpful to intending
visitors. In the first part of this article I shall deal with some of the
birds (not all) which may be seen any day throughout the busiest
part of the city and require no looking for, and in the second part with
birds to be found in most bungalow gardens and the suburbs, some of
which, owing to the nature of the vegetation, may require a little more
patience to find. Singapore is now' such an important centre that
every year the number of visitors and residents increases. When I first
knew the island many years ago, there was still much virgin jungle

left, and many birds were common then which one never sees now.
Even tigers were resident on the island, indeed the first I ever saw in a
wild state was where there is now a large resident population and
motor cars and motor buses rush through day and night. Naturally
this caused many birds formerly common to leave the island for the
mainland or only to visit it on rare occasions. This should not lessen
our interests in some of the humbler ones that remain in spite of all
that is called progress, on the contrary we should be glad that some
adapted themselves to the new conditions.
At one time Singapore was what might have been termed a green
and shady city, with many beautiful trees about everywhere. Now
every year these get less and less, in fact it seems as if there must be
someone in authority who hates the very sight of trees, and ruthlessly
cuts down every one, or so mutilates them that the remaining stumps
would be better gone altogether, so the city is getting every day more
and more a glaring shadeless mass of concrete and red tiles. This is
where everyone who has visited any of the French colonies must
admire their artistic sense. Take Saigon as an example, where every
street is a tunnel of green shade, and many of the trees bear beautiful
flowers too, in season. I only wish the authorities in Singapore had
this same sense instead of sacrificing every tree even where there
appears to be no reason for it. On every visit I find still further
favourites gone. Can we therefore expect birds to remain with all
this desecration going on. Still, as I have said, a few do, in spite of
everything.
To the observant, surely the first to attract attention should be
the White-breasted Sea Eagle [Halicetus leucogaster), whether the
visitor arrives at the docks or in the roads, especially the latter, as
every day a few may be seen circling over the shipping, and often
at rest on the long breakwater. When this was first built not so long
ago, it was a favourite resort of theirs, as much ship's offal was
washed up on the rocks. Once when I wanted a pair, I had a permit
to catch them there, but now for some reason they seem to be leaving
it, which may be due to the increasing use of oil fuel. I wonder how
many people passing along the crowded streets ever look up to see these
majestic birds circling over the city. I don't suppose one, yet as I

write this on the verandah of my room, I see two, one fully adult,
and the other in the immature brown plumage. They have been
about all the morning. Last year I was invited for a cruise around
the island, and was surprised at the number we saw on the stakes of
the Malay fish traps around the coast. In many cases they did not
even trouble to fly off when our launch passed very close to them ;
the same with a few white Egrets mingling with them. This Eagle
has a wide range from the Nicobars to the Solomons, and to the north
coast of Australia. There is no doubt they vary in size throughout their
range, even allowing for this difference in the sexes. They nest on high
trees along the coast, seeming to prefer a small rocky island just off the
coast if a suitable tree exists on it. Once, entering the long irregular
gulf leading down to Ake Selaka, on the island of Halmahiera in the
Moluccas, the captain drew my attention to a pair with a nest in a
very high tree. He said they had been there for some years, and* he
always looked out for them. This was in May, and they then had
young in the nest. We dropped anchor almost under the tree, and
twice during the morning I saw a Brahminy Kite swoop over the nest
and catch up a fish while the Eagles were away. The adult bird is
entirely white with grey wings, and very striking looking. Not so,-
however, at our Zoo, where they are always grimy. Their voices
are rather weak, very different to some of their African relations, but
what they lack in volume they make up in quantity. As may be
supposed from their habits, they are easily caught by the Malays, and
it is not an uncommon sight to find tame ones in the Malay villages.
At one along the Johore coast, a captive pair spent their days on the
roots of a tree overhanging the beach, and whenever a " prahu "
approached they went down to the edge of the water to meet it, and
usually received a small fish or two. They were particularly partial
to crabs, and took these in preference to fish if they had the choice,
eating every particle of shell and claws if they were not too large. The
Malays say they prefer sea snakes to any other food. At times they
must be able to get any amount, as often great numbers may be seen
on the surface of the sea. At certain seasons another species with black
and grey bands often came from the sea in vast numbers, especially
after rain, to lay their eggs under the roots of trees along the beaches.

All sea snakes are poisonous, although not prone to bite out of water if
handled gently. Last year I saw some remarkably fine specimens of
this Eagle in the Zoological Gardens at Saigon. They were in wonderful
plumage, and very much larger than our Singapore birds, the finest I
have ever seen. The Malay name is " Langlaut ".
Last year I heard that a man near Manila had a pair of birds he
claimed to be the well-known Monkey Eating Eagles (P. jejfreyi).
He asked rather a stiff price for them, something like #75, but seemed
open to an offer, so I got a man from the museum there to go and have
a look at them, which he did, and cabled that they were only the
immature birds of H. leucogaster and not jejfreyi at all. It is not the
first time this has happened. Many years ago on my first visit to
Mindanao I was always on the look out for jejfreyi , as at that time
only two skins existed in any museums, and often I followed up large
looking Eagles I hoped might turn out to be this species, only to find
they were the other birds in immature brown plumage. Several were
even brought in alive and declared to be Monkey Eaters. Although
I never succeeded in shooting one of those I wanted, I did see three
that were unmistakable. Since that time one has been exhibited at
the London Zoo, and can now be seen mounted up in the Natural
History Museum in a pose very familiar to those who remember it
in life. It is one of the best mounted birds there, but how many looking
at it realize that its beak and legs are not natural. The Museum wanted
not only the skin, but the complete skeleton as well, so these had to
be modelled, and are so well done they would deceive even an expert.
A bird quickly to claim everyone's attention is the Dyal Bird
(Copsychus saularis), known to British residents as the Magpie Bobin,
as they are in every garden, however small, if only there is a small
plot of grass, and very tame. Even when not seen, their song must
attract one. This perky bird, who always carries his tail upright, is a
great fighter, and drives off any other Dyal from his preserve. At such
time he looks half as large again with tail spread, wings dropped, and
all the body feathers puffed out, pouring forth his notes of abuse.
It is remarkable how exceedingly rare it is to see a female. It may
be that in their more sober plumage they hide away in the bushes,
but for every hundred cocks maybe not one hen is seen. The only

place I know where one may be seen is in the Botanical Gardens in the
very early morning or late afternoon, but even there they may require
careful looking for. They are favourite cage-birds of the Chinese, who
lavish great care on them, and even pay big prices for an extra good
songster. They nest in bushes and even in the roofs of houses in the
town, but in the country mangrove swamps seem to be favoured.
The eggs are two in number, blue with brown blotches. They are very
easy birds to hand-rear, and make delightful pets. There are about
a dozen subspecies distributed throughout the Indo-Malayan islands,
and in West Java is one all black except for a white patch on each
wing, and the underside of the outer tail feathers. This race does
not appear to be so pugnacious ; a few years ago I brought home
five cock birds together in one cage in complete harmony all the time,
which would have been impossible with the white-breasted ones. I had
never seen this black one in England before or since, although it may
have been. It is not rare in its native island, and both species are to
be found in the same district. It is said that those from South China
are the best songsters, a smaller bird than those from the Straits.
Malay name " Murai ".
Wherever a tree is now left standing, even in the business section
of the city, the harsh call of the White-collared Kingfisher (Halcyon
chloris) is constantly heard, and the bird itself is by no means shy of
being seen. This is another of the birds with a very wide distribution
and many subspecies, in some of which the blue parts are more intense.
Especially numerous around the coasts and mangrove swamps, where
they feed largely on small crabs, but are equally at home in all bungalow
gardens, feeding there on all kinds of insects and cockroaches and even
tree frogs. Their call is one of the first sounds to greet the dawn. They
are easy to rear if taken young, but troublesome if left until they
have grown their feathers, and adult birds are wild and will often
refuse all food, dead or alive. To keep them in health in captivity for
any length of time it is necessary to supply every now and then some
hard-shelled insects to effect a casting, although their main diet may
consist of raw meat. They nest in holes in trees and in old ants'
nests in most gardens. I have seen a nest also in a hole in the wall of
a building. Malay name " Baja hudang ".

A far more beautiful bird, but seldom seen now about the town
except in the suburbs, is the White-breasted Kingfisher ( H . smyrnensis
fusca), which also eats insects but prefers fish, and is therefore found
more in the vicinity of water and damp places, but often visits gardens.
Some can always be seen by the lake in the Botanical Gardens. Its
colours are chestnut, black, azure blue and white, with a red bill.
What a glorious sight it is when it opens its wings to fly from one tree
to another over the lake ; its blue then outshines the blue, violet,
pink, and white lilies floating in patches on the water below it. It is
well worth a visit to the gardens just to see one of these birds alone,
and if one is fond of nature and wants a thrill, you are sure to get it
then. This species also does well in captivity if taken at a suitable
age, but I have tried several adults and not been able to do anything
with them. It has a vast range, more or less right across Asia, with
differences. In parts of the Philippines it is very plentiful, and often
in country far from water. It eats insects and small lizards there.
The large Stork-billed Kingfisher ( Ramphalcyon amauroptera) used
to be common about the suburbs, but so many of its former haunts have
been drained and built over, and although still by no means rare, it has
to be looked for around mangrove and marshy places. I have known
them to do well in captivity, even adult caught ones. No doubt they
eat fish, but are particularly fond of lizards, and a caged one I saw
seemed fond of mice. A continental collector last year took home
some he had brought down from Siam. These are the three common
Kingfishers of Singapore island. Common in the order I have given,
but other species occur on the mainland some of which may occasionally
be met with on the island.
A very common bird found throughout the island wherever there is a
bush, tree, or only a house-top, is the Yellow-vented Bulbul (Pyenonotus
analis). It is indeed hard to go anywhere without hearing their well-
known notes, which start with the first streak of dawn, and if you have
a garden, it sounds as if every Bulbul in the city must have slept there.
They feed here on berries, insects, and many kinds of fruits, especially
the so-called Indian cherry, which is stoneless and small enough
to be swallowed whole. This sweet fruit is beloved by all fruit-eating
birds, and now so many gardens have planted these extremely graceful

and rapid-growing trees for shade purposes, they are beginning to
attract many more birds at any rate to gardens. It is a comparatively
new importation, and bears flowers and ripe fruit at the same time,
and there can only be at most a very short period in the year when
neither are to be found.
In April the Bulbuls commence to utter a new note, hard at first
to associate with them, a rather low " Cluk cluk " repeated most of
the day. This is the nesting note, and if the birds are watched they
are sure to be observed carrying materials into a bush. The nest is
not hard to find, once you hear this call. It is placed rather low down
in any thick bush, but never visible without looking for it. It will
contain two pinkish-white eggs, more or less heavily marked with
purple and brown around the base, but sometimes they vary
considerably.
There was in the heart of Singapore an old hotel recently demolished,
with a wide terrace along its front, greatly frequented from sunset to
midnight as an open-air cafe. A few bushes grew through the pave-
ment at both ends, and in one of these not more than four feet from
the ground a pair of Bulbuls had built, and were sitting when I first
knew about them. The terrace was under a glare of arc lights, and
visitors' chairs actually touched the bush within a foot of the nest.
It seemed impossible that the eggs would ever hatch out with so much
noise and disturbance, but they did, and the young were half-grown
when they were robbed, probably by one of the Chinese waiters who
first drew my attention to them. In the daytime, when the place was
quiet, I sometimes glanced in to see that all was well, and met the
bright eye of a parent bird sitting steadily and unafraid.
Only last year, in the garden yard of another hotel in the same
neighbourhood, there was a nest in the same kind of bush and about
the same height from the ground. One night at 10 o'clock an Indian
magician was giving an exhibition of being buried alive for a certain
period, and unfortunately they chose a site for the grave only about
a yard from the Bulbul's nest. Many flashlight photos were taken,
and much excitement and commotion among people actually crushed
against the bush, yet in due course both eggs hatched, but the young
were killed later by a cat, I think, this time. These two illustrations

will give an idea how fearless these birds are. They are olive-brown
in colour, much lighter underneath, the head black and white and,
of course, the undertail coverts yellow as the name implies. A specimen
has been on view in a cage in the Bird House, Regent's Park, for some
years now, one of two hand-reared from a nest near the Naval Base.
Bulbuls of all kinds are extremely easy to hand-rear, and will
repay anyone who appreciates a tame bird, and they can then be
given quite a large amount of liberty in suitable localities. As a very
young man in Morocco, I reared several of the White-vented species,
P. barbatus, common along North Africa, and one of these lived for
twenty years. For the first year at least it had a pure white tail with
black tips, which I was hoping it would retain, but in due course it
moulted out to the normal dark colour. Malay name for the Yellow-
vented is " Merbat ".
It would not do to miss from the list of familiar birds the Necklace
Dove ( Streptopelia tigrina), common throughout a large part of the
Malay Archipelago, and to be seen on most house-tops, and in most
yards and gardens. The Javanese produce queer hybrids sometimes
from this Dove, and albinism is not uncommon, so I am surprised that
a white variety has not been established. I have also seen one melanoid
bird. It is a fairly favourite cage-bird with the Malays, but far exceeded
in this respect by the smaller Barred Ground Dove (Geopelia striata).
I think it would be impossible to find a Malay home that did not keep
at least one of them, most have several, always in the same style of
cage wherever you go--a round bamboo cage with a domed top,
partially covered with red calico, and open bars on the bottom. Its
only note is a " Coo " repeated several times in succession, but if a
bird is discovered which goes one better, a fairly large price is paid
for it. I don't know if it is still the case, but a few years ago the craze
for this spread to non-Malays also, and I saw several which changed
hands at prices ranging from 120 to 200 Straits dollars. I know one
man who had the craze, and he even sent up to Penang to buy birds of
note he had heard of there. They came to the dealers' shops in Singapore
in cages containing perhaps a hundred birds ; here Malays will squat for
hours on end waiting for a bird to give an extra " Coo " or extra frequent
repetition, or perhaps to hear the quality of the voice. Each man has a

short bit of cane in his hand, and as soon as he has spotted a likely
bird he touches it once with the cane, and from that moment does not
seem to lose sight of it again, and catches up the bird unerringly among
all the jumble of fluttering birds. Dealers charge a little more for birds
selected in this way. So many tourists go to that now very sophisticated
island of Bali, and not one could have failed to notice immediately
on landing the forest of bamboo poles rising some fifty feet above every
village, each with a cage containing one Dove under an umbrella-like
arrangement at the top. These are drawn up on a pulley, and brought
down again every night. The Dove in a wild state seems to spend all
its time on the ground. Although still not scarce, they are nothing
like so plentiful in Singapore as they were some years ago. They nest
in low bamboo hedges and one or more nests will be found in any
compound surrounded by such a hedge. Both this and the preceding
Dove have a wide range throughout the Malay Archipelago, probably
much extended artificially as the Malays moving about among the
islands take their birds with them, and many must escape in the course
of time. Malay name '' Merbok
There must be very few people indeed who do not know the Java
Sparrow (. Padda oryzirora), even if they have never kept one in
their lives. Therefore to see a bird they at once recognize around their
hotel or bungalow must, I imagine, give them lively satisfaction.
This bird has spread over so many islands and countries that it is
difficult to say where its original home was, but it is generally agreed
that it was Java and Bali. Every year hundreds of thousands still
come to Singapore from Java, and one can only marvel that the supply
does not become exhausted, but this does not seem to be the case.
Where all these eventually go to would be interesting to know. There
is the representative of one Continental firm alone who makes some-
times two quick journeys yearly to the Ear East, who told me in
Singapore last year that among other things he had an order for
thirty-jive thousand Java Sparrows alone ! And so it goes on. What
would it be like in Java if they were protected ? Surely the rice
crops in a few years would be a complete failure ; they must take a
great toll as it is. I often think that this bird with his pleasing arrange-
ment of soft colours is not fully appreciated just because it is so

common. Yet he is a lovable little chap, inoffensive in an aviary,
I believe, and always seems happy and contented wherever his lot falls.
Even under atrocious conditions sometimes, you never see him dirty
or draggled, for he is so proud of himself that with only a few drops
of water he will keep on bathing until it is all used up, in fact he is a
real little gentleman.
During the nesting season it is a common sight in the bird markets
of Java to see cages with the bottom full of half-fledged youngsters,
perhaps fifty or more to a cage. Two adult birds are put in with
them, irrespective of sex, I presume, and probably, newly caught
themselves, and these two spend the whole day supplying the wants
of all these incessantly gaping mouths. When they find time for a
mouthful for themselves, I can't imagine. To me it seems pathetic.
This alone should endear them to us. I am quite sure our home
Sparrow would never do it, and I cannot think of any other bird
that would, unless possibly a Bengalee. They seem ever ready to adapt
themselves to new nesting conditions, as in Singapore, for instance,
where they are completely established throughout the island. In the
city they nest under the tiles, and in any crevice large enough to hold
them. Last year a pair built on a cornice in my hotel bedroom, and
to help them I brought in dry grass and other materials which they
seemed to appreciate, as they started to collect it at once from a table
about 2 yards from where I sat. I was sorry that I had to leave
before the young appeared, as I should have helped them with food too.
Naturally they made a little litter on the floor below, but I always
collected this up so as not to attract the room boy's attention to them.
It was a great amusement to watch them, especially as I could not get
about much, having only just come out of hospital. Another pair were
nesting in a similar site in the lounge hall below, and when no one
was passing in or out, they watched their opportunity to pull the fibres
from the coco-nut mat at the door. For a resident it should be very
easy to establish friendly relations with them, so that in a short time
you could have your own tame flock about the bungalow. A certain
bird-shop is near a Chinese temple frequented seemingly by women
only, and it is not unusual to meet some of the worshippers bargaining
with the dealer for Java Sparrows. These they take over to the

temple and let loose, as they say their prayers, to carry their petitions
to the gods ; not a practice, I think, to condemn. Some few years back,
visiting some friends on the other side of the island, I remarked on
the unusual number of Javas around their bungalow, and was told
that the wife of one of Singapore's most wealthy Chinese had recently
presented him with a son. So to celebrate the event he had gone to
the bird-shops and bought up all the Javas he could find, some ten
thousand, I believe, and let them go. So my friends supposed their
visitors were from this lot. There is a certain convent school in the
heart of the city, over whose walls hang thick bushes just escaping the
heads of passers-by, in which thousands of Javas sleep at night. Yet
it is a busy road, well lighted, and carrying a constant stream of traffic.
I happen to know the birds are there, but they keep so quiet I doubt
if anyone else does among all the passers-by. Before sunset they
assemble in flocks, and fly around preparatory to settling down for the
night, although this flight seems more in the way of pleasure than with
any fixed destination in view.
After the Java Sparrow, mention must be made of the Common
House Sparrow (Passer montanus, sub. sp. malaccensis ), which is
distributed all over Eastern Asia. This is really a Tree Sparrow, but
is not found in the jungle, and confines itself entirely to human habita-
tions like our Sparrow at home, nesting under roofs, but sometimes
in trees by the roadside. It is a little smaller than our home bird,
and more graceful in shape, and although of much the same markings,
brighter, and both sexes are alike. Where every building is so open,
they naturally come indoors much more than ours, and become very
tame, and can be made much tamer still with a little patience, as I found
last year when I was in hospital so long. They frequented the wards
in considerable numbers, and knew the hours of meals. A long table
was set in the middle of my ward for patients well enough to get up,
and at first I used to be amused at watching them dodge the attendants
to steal the bread, so I began by attracting them to my bed by dropping
crumbs over the side, and although I could not move to see them,

not long before I had them on the bed. Later I found what a passion
they had for cheese, and every day a patient brought me some, and from

that time they began to feed from my hand on the bed. One sister was
tolerant, but most drove the birds off if they happened to be around
at the time. These Sparrows, when driven off by attendants, did
not fly away as birds usually do, but hid under the beds, and it was
amusing to watch them run from under one bed to another, or double
back as they were followed up, and it often had to be given up as a
bad job. They stopped about the ward until dark, but just one more
enterprising than the others found a roosting place somewhere in a
passage leading from the ward, from whence it flew every five minutes
to my bed for an extra feed until lights were put out. The Tree
Sparrow mixes freely with the Javas about the town, and the two
kinds can always be seen feeding in company. Malay name " Pipit
rumah ", which simply means " House Sparrow ".
Still another common town bird, but not quite so prosaic as the
Sparrow, is the Glossy Calornis (C. chalybea ), which is now quite an
institution, and has certainly increased in numbers within recent
years. Most aviculturists know this group of birds with bright ruby
red eyes, although there is one species in the Moluccas with black
eyes, the only one. It is, of course, a Starling, with the nesting habits
of an African Weaver, building hanging nests in colonies on trees, but
the Straits bird does not do that, at any rate in the city. Here it nests
in any holes it can find about the roofs of houses, and under tiles.
I watched a pair last year appropriate the nest of a pair of Javas
under the roof of the hotel annex, and later two other pairs started to
build close by, so they still like company. What makes this bird
conspicuous is its habit of collecting in immense flocks towards evening
exactly after the manner of our Starlings over London. Here, too,
one is surprised how they all suddenly turn off sharply in another
direction in perfect unison. One favourite roosting place, and has
been for years, is in one or two trees at the north-west corner of the
Cathedral close, facing the Adelphi Hotel, where an incessant warbling
is kept up until late at night. They are very partial to the bright
scarlet fruit of a certain palm, which grows in clumps, and is not very
lofty. The fruit is the size of a large pea, and hangs in long masses
around the base of the leaves. A group of these palms in any compound
attracts the Calornis from far and near. They keep very silent when

feeding. This fruit is relished by many other birds, Pheasants for
one. I always use it when I can, as I consider wild fruits much better
for birds than some of the cultivated ones. It is not pleasant to our
taste.
The last of the real city birds I shall be able to touch on are the
Malay House Swifts (.Micropus affines). A stranger passing along the
deserted streets of the older business parts at night might well wonder
from where all the strange twitterings came, for these birds build
their nests in colonies along the beams of the verandah ceilings over the
sidewalks. These are by no means neat, and look like untidy masses
of old wool and felt, an accumulation of years, and are inhabited all
the year round. The Chinese consider it lucky to have the birds attach
themselves to their premises, so they are never disturbed. So many
of these old buildings are now being pulled down and modern ones
being put up which afford no hold for their nests, that every month
colony after colony have to seek fresh nesting sites. It is difficult to
know what the birds will do in the future under the changed conditions.
I see many have sought refuge in the church spires and the minarets
of the larger mosques, but as these will not suffice some other change
in their habits will have to be made. I examined some nests pulled down
from a condemned building, and as I broke them to pieces clouds of
small moths flew out, and inside they were full of vermin. They are
hard to pull to pieces, like felt but softer, and inside the colour of dirty
wool, although more or less blackish outside, and were mixed with a
little grass, certainly an unsavoury mass. Some contained eggs and a
few very young birds. On the wing the birds look intensely black,
although their colour is really brownish black, and with a conspicuously
white rump. They are silent when flying, and do not assemble in flocks
as our Swifts do in the evening. They must consume an immense
amount of insect life, and for this alone are invaluable in the tropics.
Malay name " Layang-layang ".
These " familiar " birds I have chosen, with the exception of two
of the Kingfishers, may be met with around any hotel within a few
hours of landing. Those going for a drive round, or to a bungalow, may
see many more, some of which I will write about in the concluding part.

By J. Appleby
It is some years since I sent a few notes on feeding the commoner
Finches and other small birds (December, 1934), and asking other
members to give ns the benefit of their advice and experience.
My suggestion fell on barren ground or, at any rate, I have missed
the articles.
" The time has come," the Walrus said, " to talk of many
things---of shoes, and ships, and sealing-wax, of cabbages and kings."
Hence these discursive notes on a very ordinary aviary, but which
I rather fancy is the usual form Aviculture takes with most of our
members, even though Parrots and Birds of Paradise may take a
prominent position among the more opulent.

I wonder how many people use galvanized iron pipes for the frame-
work of their flights. It costs more than wood, but the durability is
a lifetime, and now that the Coronation stands are coming down, tubes
ought to go cheap. Cut into the requisite lengths screwed at each end,
tee and angle-pieces can be fixed and any rectangular structure built,
over this wire can be strained tightly and you have as good and as
lasting a structure as any they have at the Zoo.
An inch tube is strong enough for a 9 ft. wide and 10 ft. high frame,
and if put up in 6 ft. sections to take 6 ft. wide f in. wire, the tubes
should be 5 ft. 10 in. long to allow for the coupling, your wire will then
lace up tight. Now as to wire, f or J in. mesh of 19 gauge should be used,
the former if you are likely to be troubled with mice. Paint every-
thing, tubes and wire, with one of the many forms of black bituminous
paint, ordinary oil paint won't last and does not preserve the metal,
and black so that the wire is not too obvious.
Of course, all this is heresy to the advocator of movable aviaries.
But how many of us can or wish to move our birds about all over the
garden. Iron tube has one pull over wood, you can take it to pieces
and cart it away and put it up as before and just as sound, only see
that all the joints are greased when erecting.

J. Appleby--Notes from a Lancashire Aviary
Two of my aviaries are just rectangular boxes, tubes along bottom
as well as top, and so need no foundation and simply rest on the ground
and, having no trouble from rats or mice, the wire does not go below
the bottom tube. Furnishing flights with shrubs, grass, and plants in
general is not so simple as it sounds, for it all depends on the birds
you keep. Nothing green lasts or lives with Canaries or Budgerigars.
I'm wrong, they neither will touch bluebells. I have not had any trouble
with Australian Finches, or West African birds, Buntings, Weavers,
or Wydahs.
Box bushes, cupressus, and berberis are good varieties, and tall
sedges, Cyperus longus , flags, iris, hemerocallis. So keep your Budgies
and Canaries to themselves, they stand very rough treatment with me
and the others will be the happier without them.
If you wish to turf your flight floor good rough sods will stand best,
but the drip from wire roof seems to upset the grass and the zinc off
the galvanized wire is just poison to any green plant, so you may have
to do it each year, it all depends on the aspect of your flight and if
your wire is painted. I generally leave my flights rough, as many of
the Waxbills, etc., build in last year's dead stuff and like to hunt
among the bents.
Of course, some very heavy stuff like iris leaves have to be moved,
otherwise Nature deals with droppings and humus. Perches are
branches hung horizontally from the roof, and I try not to have one
branch above another, so droppings do not collect on any.
Now for a word in support of Mr. Teague's note on salts in bird
food. Last autumn I saw a consignment of 3,000 Australian Finches
arrive at the Liverpool Zoo in excellent condition. I bought a number
and they are going strong to-day (two pairs Ruficaudas nesting out-
doors). The cages (over forty) were excellently arranged, and I was
informed that the death roll from leaving Perth to landing at Hull
was only five. I can believe it ; I asked the cause and was shown the
method of feeding and watering, which, by the way, took a man and
a boy two hours to go once round, and as this was done three times
a day and cleaning added it was a full-time job. Yellow millet was given
in a large tin, for a certain time, ascertained by the way the birds fed,
taken out and the same tin supplied with crushed sea-shell and charcoal,

and another with water ; these left in for, say, half an hour, and
removed. The result was, birds fed in a mass as soon as seed put in,
no fighting, and they all got a fill; the same applies to grit and water,
it was simply amazing, and I told the owner he was the finest sergeant-
major I'd ever met.
Now what stuck at the back of my mind was sea-shell and charcoal,
and about that time Mr. Teague wrote about poultry salts, made by
British Glue and Chemicals Co., Newark, and things seemed to click,
so I got some--Churn Brand No. 3 Iodized Minerals for Cage Birds,
and I also baked or burnt some oyster shells and ground them up in a
coffee-mill along with some charcoal. With this I mixed about one-
third No. 3 salts and fed to all birds in a separate container, and to
all soft food I add a trace of No. 3, as you would salt your own food.
Now for results. Nothing to brag about, but definitely better than
before treatment. Budgerigars breed like rabbits, a nuisance to dispose
of them. Canaries nearly as bad, forty-seven and twenty-three young
respectively last season ; odds and ends of others : Zebras six, Silver-
bills five, Grassfinch, Longtailed, four, Olive Finch two, other
expectations.
Now is this due to Mr. Teague's salts or to the fact that the birds
have been left very much to themselves, owing to my being on my back
for six weeks and they only being fed and cleaned by a kind lady friend
and my gardener ? It hurts one's pride to think so, and so I come down
on the side of charcoal and salts and I thank Mr. Teague for bringing
Iodized Mineral Salts to the front. I even passed it on to my son, a
sheep farmer in New Zealand, and he was much interested in the
subject, as he uses a similar preparation called Lixit in block form for
his ewe lambs. I'm only sorry I did not know of Iodized Salts soon
enough to save the loss of four Gouldian hens last summer being egg-
bound ; all the usual methods failed.
Slogan : Use Iodized Mineral Salts and Charcoal and rear more
birds.

In the June Magazine I proclaimed that the Sandhill Cranes had
laid and were incubating their eggs. They did this in most exemplary
fashion, relieving each other at regular intervals, though it was noticed
that if rain came on it was always the female's turn to be sitting : her
husband would be in shelter until the rain stopped, then he came
out and relieved his dripping wife. There is this to be said for him,
he did not desert his post during the very hot days, but sat panting
with wide open beak.
A chick hatched on 8th June, a pretty russet-coloured mite covered
with very thick down. It seemed lively, and readily took the food its
father gave it. We noticed that he seemed more interested in it than
its mother was: he brooded it, while she wandered about. For three days
all went well, then the old birds seemed to lose interest in the chick,
they were not so ready to feed it, and paid less attention to its calls.
The weather, too, was less propitious, with violent thunderstorms and
colder nights, and the chick found it very exhausting to follow its
parents through the wet herbage. On the 13th it was found dead.
Its parents did not appear to miss it, though the male bird had been
very savage all the time they were incubating.
The other egg was addled. The nest was a platform of bits of stick
and grass, roughly put together. Both birds took part in its construction.

PARROTS AS FOSTER-PARENTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9391025" page_id="56322082"  page_num="210" year="" vol="">
By The Marquess of Tavistock
In a large Parrakeet collection one sometimes has to try experiments
in fostering deserted eggs on species different to those by which the
eggs were produced. Numbers of the Parrot family are, on the whole,
fairly accommodating about accepting eggs different in size or shape
from their own, but trouble may arise at a later stage when the chicks
make their appearance. Unfortunately for the success of fostering
ventures, some baby psittacine birds enter the world dressed, like

ourselves, in pink birthday suits ; while others have a considerable
covering of white or yellow fluff. This latter phenomenon appears
to produce a very disturbing effect on the minds of foster-parents used
to naked infants, and they generally refuse to feed ; although the
reverse does not seem to hold good, as I have had naked chicks well
reared by a foster-mother whose own children would have been fluffy.
Some years ago a hen Crimson-wing reared two very good Ringnecks,
but the reverse experiment--Crimson-wing eggs given to a Ringneck
foster has just failed in one of my aviaries, where a Ringneck chick
is still alive, but its Crimson-wing foster-brother, clothed in white,
has died, apparently unfed. It may be for this same reason that
ninety-nine Budgerigars out of a hundred are useless as foster-parents
for the fluffy chicks of Grass Parrakeets, letting them die at once.
Nyassa Lovebirds will sometimes rear Grass Parrakeets, but the
other species usually kill them when they begin to detect the fraud.
Bourke's will occasionally rear the young of green species of Grass
Parrakeets, but more commonly desert them when the green feathers
begin to appear.
A grey Parrot in my collection killed the fluffy young she hatched
from two Yellow-rumped Parrakeet eggs, but this may be because
she was unmated, spinster foster-mothers being often erratic, and
apparently fearful of scandal should eggs hatch that ought to be
infertile !
I have had young Barrabands well reared by a Sula Island King
in the same nest as her own hybrid Crimson-wing offspring ; while
at Poxwarren Park young Princess of Wales's were well reared by
Crimson-wings in the same nest as their own offspring.
In my own collection a Layard's Parrakeet did so far overcome
the objection to white fluff as to rear a Crimson-wing after a fashion,
but it was rickety and died soon after leaving the nest. Crimson-wings
seem, however, to be a difficult proposition for any fosters of other
species, a hen King of my own--a particularly good and devoted
mother--failing to make an entire success of two she raised in a good
nest, one of them being slightly rickety.

A further issue of the O.P.S. Journal has just been sent out. This
number has been translated into French and printed in both French
and English and has been distributed to phasianists in France and
Belgium. The editors made a great effort to produce something rather
above the ordinary, and I think they have been successful. This
Journal should prove of interest to all interested in aviculture. There
are two coloured plates, one of which was painted by an artist well
known to members of the Avicultural Society, Mr. Boland Green. This
portrays a Satyr Tragopan cock and is a fine specimen of Mr. Green's
artistic work. The second is the work of a Japanese artist and depicts
the Versicolor cock, a subject hardly ever attempted in the past. In
this case the artist has accomplished a most amazing effect ; gazing
at this picture one fully expects to see this male bird walk off the page,
it is so life-like and realistic. In this Journal we have some most
interesting articles from well-known phasianists. Perhaps the most
novel feature is the work of our President, Monsieur J. Delacour. Three
maps are published and these deal with the natural habitats of the birds
that the author writes about in this article. Peafowl, Argus, and Peacock
Pheasants are included, and I will here mention that in future issues
our President has kindly promised to take in rotation the many other
species of Pheasants until our readers, will have had the opportunity
of gaining most valuable knowledge appertaining to this interesting
subject. Other prominent authorities who write in this Journal are
the Marquess Hachisuka, Monsieur Y. Malisoux, Dr. Chapin, Captain C.
Scott Hopkins, Miss V. Cooper, and Messrs. Gray and P. C. Mackie. ;
Monsieur Delacour also writes a review on a book on Pheasants, recently
published by Professor A. Ghigi. Our Clergy members present their
answers to the question : " Why do Ornamental Pheasants make an
appeal ? " If there is any member of the Avicultural Society who would
like to see this Journal I shall be very pleased to send a copy on receipt
of a postcard. It is quite probable that a few would like to read the
French issue ; here again we are very pleased to forward.

We seldom see many species of the Gontigidse over this side of the
Atlantic, where they are only imported on very rare occasions.
In the Bird House at the London Zoo is one of the four species of
this bird, namely The Naked-throated Bell-bird or Ghaomorhynchus
nudicollis, which is an inhabitant of South-East Brazil. In the British
Museum Catalogue of Birds, Volume 14, is the following description :
White above and beneath, sides of the head and throat naked, with
small scattered bristles, bill black, feet brown, whole length 11 inches,
wing 6&apos;2, tail&apos;3*5'. Female, above green, eyes darker, beneath yellowish,
striped with green ; throat greyish with black strictions, crissum yellow.
The only other person so far as I am aware who has owned a specimen
of this bird is Mr. H. Whitley, who exhibited it at the Crystal Palace
Show in 1932.
The late Mr. H. Gurney, of Norwich, owned one of the species of
Bell-birds, but as I did not see the specimen, I am unaware which
one it was.
In the Bird Gallery at the Natural History Museum, London, are
the three following species exhibited :--
1. Ghaomorhynchus nireus. --Snow-white, head with a long thinly-
feathered caruncle arising from the front ; bill and feet black ; whole
length 10*5 inches, wing 6*5, tail 4. Female , above green, beneath
yellowish, variegated with green, crissum yellowish. Very common
in Museum collections. A very excellent account of this bird is given
in Waterton's Wanderings in South America, page 180.
2. Ghaomorhynchus variegateus. --Pure white, head coffee-brown,
wings black, throat denuded and covered with small caruncles ; bill
and feet black, whole length 10 inches, wing 6&apos;2, tail 2*4. Female ,
above green, head greyish, beneath pale yellowish, with green stria-
tions on the breast and belly, throat greyish, with finer striations.
Habitat: Guiana, Venezuela, and Trinidad. Mr. H. Whitley collected
this bird at Boraima, British Guiana.
3. Ghaomorhynchus tricarunculatus. --Clear chestnut brown, head
above and neck below pure white, three long naked caruncles, one
from the middle of the front and the two lateral forms under the

At Tsintoa I was not sorry to bid farewell to North China. The
cold, desolation, and filth had been unbelievable.
I now sailed for the verdant Philippine Islands, but not before the
cold and dust had had a disastrous effect on a weak chest. No sick
or weary traveller in the desert ever longed so fervently for the sight
of an oasis as the writer did for a glimpse of the green mountains of
Luzon. The blue skies, verdant vegetation, and warm balmy air acted
as no medicine would have done and in a few days time after my
arrival in the beautiful city of Manila, I was up and about again.
Truly, I would rather be a beggar in the Philippines than a rich man
in Manchukuo.
It was impossible to acquire any live birds in the Philippines,
firstly because wise laws have been enacted prohibiting the catching
or the killing of the fast disappearing avifauna. The Philippines like
most other countries are being deforested at an alarming rate, and as
the indigenous vegetation disappears so does the bird life. As no birds
are allowed to be caught or sold there were none in the market, and as
the aquarium craze seemed to be sweeping Manila every so-called bird
shop seemed to be now an aquarist's depository. The only birds I saw
offered for sale besides canaries were a few cockatoos (Lemon-crested),

including one of the indigenous species, the Red-vented ( Ducorjpsius
hdematuro&apos;pygius), and a hybrid Amhurst-Golden Pheasant.
Later on I made the acquaintance of Dr. Manuel, the Director of
Ornithology for the Philippines, and he informed me that if I cared
to apply to the government for a permit to export live birds it would
no doubt be granted, then I could go to the more distant islands and with
the help of the natives collect birds for myself. Owing to the state of
my health, and also to the fact that I already had over fifty birds with
me, I deemed it the best not to go, though I was anxious to get hold
of some of the lovely Pittas which inhabit the Philippines. One of these,
Steer's Pitta [Pitta steeri), is one of the most gorgeous of the whole
group, being of a vivid shade of silvery blue with markings of red
and black.
Birds are not kept by the Pilipinos to the extent to which they are
by the Chinese. One sees an odd parrot or two, a cockatoo, a pair of
Java Sparrows, or a dove, but that is all. Fish are all the rage and
nearly every home seems at least to have one aquarium. The advantage
of being an aquarist in the Philippines is that one can keep any kind
of tropical fish without heat.
I visited with Dr. Manuel the establishment of the Rev. Aguilar
at Makati, whom, I believe, is a member of the Society. Unfortunately
this gentleman was not at home, but with the permission of his house-
keeper we wandered round and viewed the unique collections of parrots.
There were many very rare specimens, all in perfect condition and very
tame. I noticed Swainson's, Scaly-breasted, and Reticulated Lories,
Red-vented, Lemon-crested, Black, Palm, Blue-eyed, White and Rose-
crested and Roseate Cockatoos, various Australian Parrakeets, three
or four different species of Macaws a few of the Philippine Green-
winged Doves, some of the unique Bleeding-heart Pigeons, and last,
but not least, a single specimen of the Palawan Peacock Pheasant.
This unique bird is the only pheasant inhabiting the Philippines and
is one of the smallest of pheasants but at the same time one of the most
beautiful. It is found only in the island of Palawan in the far South of
the group. There were also some Parrot-finches, which, I was told, had
been introduced into the Philippines from the Solomons some few
years ago.

Thanks to the kindness of Dr. Manuel who arranged for an assistant
from the Bureau of Science to go with me into a suitable district in
Bizal, I was able to get a short glimpse of the bird life of Luzon ; of
course, I saw only the commoner species, as the rarer forest forms have
long since been driven into the remote districts where there is still
forest left.
The most common, and at the same time the most conspicuous,
is the Philippine Oriole ( Oriolus acrorhynchus), a lovely bird, clad like
the rest of the family in brilliant yellow with black markings. In this
species the female is nearly as brightly coloured as the male. Their
low ringing notes can be heard on every hand and parties of birds seen
in the mango trees behaving in a very restless manner and constantly
flying in and out of the trees. I believe these birds are very partial
to the mangrove trees even though the trees were not in fruit. The
Orioles besides feeding on the mangoes feed also on the native fruits.
Another common and very noticeable bird is the Long-nosed Shrike
(i Cephalopheneus nasutus ) a beautiful bird with a long, flowing, black
tail and from its habit of settling on the top of a low bush or bare
branch of a tree reminded me of an old favourite in Africa, the Long-
tailed Shrike, a bird which it closely resembles except for the addition
of chestnut to its black and white plumage.
Our attention was attracted to the various and melodious notes of
the Philippine Bulbul [Ixos philippenis) a fairly large bird, but very
inconspicuously coloured, which rather bewilders the newly arrived
naturalist with its great variety of notes and imitations of those of
other birds. These bulbuls seem to keep to the tops of the tall trees in
small parties. Another very common Bulbul is the Philippine Yellow-
vented ( Pycnonotus goiavier), a very abundant species about the
cultivated lands, being attracted by the fruits. This is a local form of
a very widely distributed species.
In the dense vegetation by a tiny stream issued a sound which at
once brought back memories of Africa ; this was the call of the Bed-
winged Coucal ( Centropus viridis). The Coucals, a genus of birds
closely allied to the Cuckoos and which are distributed through the
tropical parts of the Old World, are distinguished by their extraordinary
call which is more or less uniform in all the species ; this is a loud

bubbling sound like water being poured out of a narrow-necked bottle
and is quite unmistakable.
The Philippines possess some exquisite Sunbirds, one of the most
beautiful being the Yellow-breasted [Cinnyris jugularis) , a very common
bird in the open woodlands. In the course of a few hours one comes
across a great many of the exquisite mites and their sombrely coloured
mates.
Sometimes we saw perched in most conspicuous places a very
large warbler-like bird almost the size of a thrush ; this was the
Striated Marsh Warbler (. Megalurus palustris). It is a beautiful bird
though clad only in various shades of brown with black striations.
It must be one of the largest of the warblers.
Another bird which awakened memories of other happy days was
the Pied Fantail (Rhipidura javanica nigritorquis), a distant relative
of the New Zealand Fantail, a beautiful little bird but with nothing
like the endearing charm of the latter. It dances and flits about the
tops of the trees in true Fantail fashion, making a minute search for
the tiny flying insects upon which it feeds.
We were fortunate in seeing the Pied Chat ( Pratincola caprata),
the only chat indigenous to the Philippines. The male is a very con-
spicuous black and white bird, the female being brown. Owing to
their habit of perching in exposed positions and puffing out their
feathers they are apt to look very much larger than they really are.
In the dense vegetation and thick grass we saw several specimens
of the Golden-headed Warbler ( Cisticola exilis) a very minute warbler-
like bird. We heard the beautiful soft notes of the Eastern Ruby-
throat, a lovely bird of which I had several with me in Manila. This bird
is a winter migrant to the Philippines from the dreary wastes of Siberia
and Kamtschatka. It is of skulking habit and keeps to the ground in
the dense vegetation.
Several Taylor Birds ( Orthotomus derhianus) were seen. These are
dimunitive Warbler-like birds, remarkable on account of their method
of stitching together leaves in the shape of a pouch in which they place
their nest. They are found in most of the tropical countries in the
Far East.
Two species of Doves are common in the cultivated parts of Rizal:

one, the Barred Dove ( Geopelia striata), is one of the commonest birds
in the Far East, being found from India to Australia. This bird has
a very pleasant and continuous " coo " and is greatly appreciated as
a cage-bird by the natives of the various countries on that account,
especially by the Malays. The other is Dussumier's Turtle Dove
(Streptelia dussumier ) which is often seen in the thick bushes and trees.
It also is often kept by the natives and differs but little from the
ordinary Eastern Turtle Dove. The Philippines are the metropolis
of the Pigeon family, no less than fifty-five various species being found
on the islands, including many very strange and very beautiful species
of which the " Bleeding Hearts " are perhaps the best known. There
are also some giant Fruit Pigeons which inhabit the dense forests of
some of the lesser known islands. These islands are also the home of
some of the most beautiful of the Pittas, the commonest being the
Black-headed ( Pitta sordida ) a bird which I possessed some years ago
and of which many local subspecies are found on the various islands
in the East Indies. The next commonest species is the Red-breasted
(Pitta erithrogastra) which is not to be confused with Mackot's Pitta
which is also known as the Red-breasted and which has a wide distri-
bution, being found in Australia, New Guinea, and various East Indian
islands. Two very distinct Pittas of large size are also found in certain
restricted areas in the Philippines, namely Kock's Pitta (Pitta kochi)
and Steer's Pitta (Pitta steeri). The former is clad in a plumage of the
most vivid scarlet, lilac-grey, brown, and deep blue, and, contrary to
the habits of most Pittas, is confined to tops of certain high mountains
above 6,000 feet, in districts where there is often sharp frost. This
must be the only Pitta which is confined to such a district. It is very
rare even in its native habitat and as far as I know has never been
captured alive. The other bird is even more beautiful, being a wonderful
shade of almost luminous pale blue marked with black, white, and
crimson, and is probably the most beautiful of all the Pittas. It also
is very rare and not many skins of these lovely birds are to found in
museums.
The Philippines possess many striking Woodpeckers, but I saw
only one of these, the Large-billed Pygmy Woodpecker (Dryobates
moluccemsis validirostris), a very small bird as its name would imply,

and which we saw searching for insects on the dead limbs of a tall
forest tree.
Swifts are very common in the Philippines, but the only ones we
saw appeared to be Whitehead's Swift (Collocalia whiteheadi), a very
small species which flies around in the early mornings at an incredible
speed. The only other birds of interest which we saw were the Asiatic
Harrier [Circus spilonotus) which is very common around Manila, and
the Brahminy Kite (Haliastur indus intermedins ) commonly seen
about the wharves on the lookout for any scraps thrown overboard
from the ships. Two more birds commonly seen in the vicinity of the
docks are the Eastern Black-headed Gull [Lams ridihundus sihiricus)
and Swinhoe's Whiskered Tern ( Chlidonias ).
After a short stay in the Philippines I returned to Singapore--
what a relief to get back to that verdant island and its busy city life.
Upon my arrival I found a note asking me to visit a person in
Johore, the native state at the extremity of the Malay Peninsula,
so I collected up all my baggage, which by this , time had reached
alarming proportions, and my birds, hired a motor lorry, and departed
thence.
What a relief it was to get to this apparent sylvan paradise far away
in Johore. Here cut out of a rubber forest was a garden planted with
hibiscus, orchids, gardenias, and a hundred other varieties of fragrant
tropical flowers, with palms and gorgeous tropical creepers, little
streams with brilliant tropical fish which darted about in the sunlit
waters like animated jewels, and an atmosphere of what appeared to
be peace and rest that I have seldom found elsewhere, though I was
to be disillusioned later. How easy, I imagined at the time, would it
be to dream one's life away in such a tropical haven of delight, but, alas,
all Edens seem to have their serpents !
My birds, travel-stained and weary after the hardships of the
journeyings in China and Manchuria, responded to the warmth and
sunshine like wilting flowers and in a few weeks most of them had
improved almost beyond recognition.
Once or twice a week I went into Singapore to do some shopping
and visit the bird shops. This latter was a never-ending source of
interest as there was usually something new and interesting to be

purchased and many were the times when the car was sadly overladen
with purchases from the bird shops. Once I picked up two apparently
magnificent Argus Pheasants, both crowded into a Malayan fowl
basket in which they had been for some days, with only rice to eat,
which had been thrown on to the bottom of the basket, and had by
this time been trodden into the droppings. Their wonderful wing and
tail feathers had been sadly broken by being confined in such a cramped
space. On getting them out to Johore one bird was found to be
desperately ill. I thought it had pneumonia : its eyes were shut and it
gasped for breath making in the meantime an awful noise like a man
dying from pneumonia. A native servant who said that he knew some-
thing about birds administered a mixture of chopped garlic and oil
which was forced down the bird's throat. The noise of its breathing
kept me awake most of the night and I kept getting up every hour
or so to see how it was getting on. In the morning it was not dead as
I expected. It seemed to revive and the next day we placed it in an
outdoor aviary with its companion. At the end of a week it seemed
much improved, but, alas, after a couple of weeks I lost both birds.
I had left them to the Chinese servant who was supposed to know all
about their feeding. I felt rather a guilty conscience about this for
had I attended to them myself as I did to all my other birds and fed
them upon all manner of fruits, insects, nuts, and greenfood, I might
have been able to save them. However I heard afterwards that they
were ailing birds from a well-known dealer who had sent them to the
bird shops to be disposed of at a cheap price knowing that they would
ultimately die. This dealer seemed to have a monopoly of all the
pheasants imported into Singapore and unless one went to him, one
either got none at all or sick and ailing birds.
I afterwards purchased six splendid birds from the dealer, three
hens and three cocks. These I looked after myself, feeding them on,
besides grain, all manner of fruit such as cut-up banana, pawpaw,
apples, soaked raisins, peanuts, and grapes, of which they are extremely
fond. In fact I find most Pheasants relish grapes, especially if they
are cut up.
Argus pheasants are not particularly expensive to buy in Singapore,
but the cost of bringing these birds home is very high. First of all huge

crates have to be made, that is if one wants to be assured of the birds'
safe arrival in England. The ones I used and which accommodated one
pair of birds were 6 feet long, 3 feet high, and 2 ft. 6 in. wide. True,
I have seen birds shipped in much smaller crates, but I like my birds
to travel comfortably. Even this is not too large when one considers
that a fully plumaged male is over 6 feet in length. The freight on each
of these crates is about #7 and with dock charges, transport to and
from the docks, etc., food, and other things, Argus Pheasants are
quite expensive items by the time they are installed in our aviaries
and it is little wonder that they are not often offered for sale on the
home market.
Very few white people in Malaya have seen wild Argus ; even the
most experienced big game hunters will admit to never seeing this bird
though they have told me they have frequently come across the display
ground which is an open space in the forest kept clear of all vegetation
and where the male displays his marvellous wing feathers. Sometimes,
I was told, the Sakais, the primitive aborigines, who are forest-dwellers,
take the eggs of the Argus Pheasants, and hatch them under fowls and
sometimes tame Argus can be seen about the Sakai encampments.
The Argus is a wonderful harmony in browns, the full beauty of
which is only to be seen when the bird is in display. The primary wing
feathers with their pale blue shafts and wonderful symmetrical spotting
are one of the most perfect things in Nature. It is amazing to think
that the cock carries the enormous secondary wing feathers and the
elongated tail feathers, which one would think would be a great
hindrance in the battle of life, just for a more or less momentary
display. No doubt the knowledge that he has this hampering impedi-
menta has developed a sense of extreme caution for in a wild state
no bird is more wary or suspicious than the Argus. The usual way the
natives trap these birds is by setting nooses near the display ground.
One sees practically no Malayan Argus for sale in Singapore ; the
birds offered for sale are the Bornean which are easily distinguished from
the other by the bright orange brown colouring at the base of the neck.
It must not be thought that one often sees these birds offered for
sale as this is not the case. One dealer only, who owns the Singapore
Zoo and who makes a speciality of Pheasants, has these birds for sale.

The restrictions on the sale and importation of pheasants into Singapore
make them difficult to obtain.
The Bornean or Gray's Argus is so common in Borneo that I was
told they are kept in pens by Europeans for eating purposes like
ordinary fowls.
There is no more thrilling sound to the naturalist and none perhaps
which echoes the very spirit of the wild places of the Earth more than
the nocturnal call of the Argus Pheasant. In the stillness of night
when it is high full moon in Malaya, the mighty sonorous cries ring
out of the very depth of the virgin forests echoing miles away in the
forest covered valleys. It is a sound which can never be described on
paper nor can it ever be appreciated away from those mighty forests
where since the penetration of the country by Man its volume and
carrying propensities have impressed both native and traveller alike.
The call is not harsh or unpleasant but there is something about it
that when heard in the stillness of a tropical night makes a kind of
cold feeling go down one's spine. The call heard from captive birds at
Home looses its thrill and seems to lack the resonance of the wild birds.
To my mind the Argus Pheasant is the most fascinating of all the
Pheasants, there is always something mysterious about it ; we never
quite get to know it like the other and more familiar Pheasants ; it
seems to stand aloof from them all, dignified and illusive.
One comes upon all manner of rarities (barring softbills) in the bird
shops in Singapore, if one perseveres in the search. All manner of birds
are brought in by the natives from the small sailing craft which are
continually coming into Singapore from the various islands and the
coastal regions of Malaya.
There are dozens of pathetic looking little Gibbons of various colours,
cream, white, smoky grey, and brown ; Lemurs, beautifully coloured
squirrels. I once chanced on a Cobego or flying lemur, one of the most
extraordinary looking of all mammals. I purchased it thinking to save
its life, but it must have been injured or diseased for it only lived a few
days. On rare occasions one saw cages of Lories, but these, if not sold
quickly, soon died from inadequate food. I heard from those in
authority that Lories are now scarce on the market as their export is
restricted from the Dutch East Indies.

I believe that the Lories which are now brought in are looked after
very much better than formerly, though the ones I saw looked for the
main part in very bad condition and, by the way the ones I pur-
chased ate when given decent food, they appeared to have been
starving.
Sometimes, rare and beautiful insect-eating birds find their way
into the shops, usual birds caught by natives and sold to the dealers
for a few cents. These linger for a few days and eventually die of
starvation unless purchased in the meantime by some one who knows
something about them.
Quite a few of the exquisite little Hanging Parrots are usually
offered for sale. When first caught they are wonderful, but they soon
droop and die on the usual diet of boiled rice.
There are no more lovely members of the Parrot family than these
multi-coloured feathered mites, less than half the size of a Lovebird.
Their colours are vivid scarlet, Cambridge blue, intense grass green, and
golden yellow. They must be seen just after they are caught to be
fully appreciated. The Dutch name for these birds, " Yleermuis-
papagaai," is very appropriate and refers to their bat-like habit of
hanging upside down to sleep. In a state of nature the birds feed on
the nectar of the coco-nut flowers. They are fond of " Tuba ", as it is
called in the East Indies, a sweet palm juice which the natives gather

the juice in the joint of a bamboo.
I purchased a few Fireback Pheasants from the dealers' shops,
but these were always kept very surreptitiously out of the way in some
dark corner as though the owners were frightened of any one getting
to know. Many rare Firebacks were promised, but only a few ever
materialized and these were the Malayan Buff-tailed Crestless. The
ones which I brought back with me were purchased from the dealer
who runs the Singapore Zoo and these consisted besides the species
mentioned, of the Bornean Crested and Viellot's. I arranged to purchase
some of the rare Bornean Crestless but these died before I could obtain
them from the dealer. I saw in the museum at Singapore the skin of
a very rare crestless species from Sumatra, this is Salvadori's Crestless
Fireback, in which the male is black with blue reflections like an

Edward's, but the female instead of being black like the other crestless
species is a mottled brown like the females of the crested species.
The large Eirebacks are very fine pheasants indeed, especially the
Yieillot's. There are various sub-species of the Crested Firebacks which
are rather confusing to the amateur. The Crestless species, of which
there are three, are small fowl-like birds in which the hens are black
except in Salvadori's. These birds are not well known to pheasant
keepers in this country ; for one thing they do not stand our winters
well and need to be closed up at night.
The crestless species are terrible fighters and even hens will kill
each other in a very short time if confined together.
All Firebacks are inhabitants of hot steamy tropical forests, so it is
little wonder that they are not as hardy as other Pheasants.

(Emblema picta)
By Prebendary J. E. Sweetnam, F.B.S.A.
There appear to be three previous records of the breeding of this
beautiful little bird in the British Isles. Mr. H. Willford was the first
to succeed in 1910, and the same pair bred with Mr. Mathias the
following year. Another pair reared one young bird almost to maturity
with Mr. B. Phillipps in 1911, and a long account of this breeding,
together with a dissertation on the species, is contained in the Magazine
of that year.
The only other record is that of our member, Mr. A. J. Patterson,
in 1935, who succeeded in rearing one young bird to maturity.
The impression left on one's mind by reading these, and such other
accounts of the breeding of Emblema picta as are available, is that it is
(or was) not only a very rare, but a difficult species, to breed.
As my experience with them goes to show just the opposite and,
incidentally, to contradict many of the statements contained in such
meagre records as exist, our Editor may perhaps feel justified in
allowing me some space in this number to record my experience in
rearing seven young to maturity during June of this year.

J. E. Sweetnam--Breeding the Painted Finch
I had better say here that my experience with the species is, so
far, limited to one adult pair, which I obtained last October. These
were privately imported, and were stated to have been themselves
aviary-bred in Australia.
As mentioned in some general notes I sent in at the end of last
year, this pair made an abortive attempt at breeding in an inside heated
aviary in November, after which the hen started moulting. By March
they were again in perfect condition and, that month, laid and incubated
six fertile eggs in an old canary bath, hung rather low down on the wall
of the same aviary--a converted attic with central heating run in from
the house, and with additional overhead lighting.
As all six youngsters were thrown out of the nest as soon as hatched,
I concluded the cock was in too high breeding condition to be trusted,
so I divided the next clutch of six eggs between two good pairs of
Bengalese in an outside unheated aviary. They hatched all six, of which
five flew on 1st June. Of these five I lost one when the foster parents
went to nest again and somewhat neglected its feeding. In the mean-
time, the pair of Painted Pinches had gone to nest again in the same
place as before and, this time, successfully reared the three young to
maturity--thus making a total of seven young reared to maturity
from one pair within six months. At the moment of writing this obliging
pair of birds are again sitting on either five or six eggs, which I intend
to transfer again to Bengalese, in the expectation that the parents will
continue to oblige with another clutch within ten days or so, and
that I may repeat the original performance !
If this pair of mine can be taken as representative of the species,
it should not be long before this delightfully sociable and, in my
experience, hardy and prolific bird has its place in the aviaries of many
of our members.
Now for some details to supplement the scrappy and rather con-
tradictory information so far available :--
Period of Incubation. --As, on each occasion, incubation commenced
after the laying of the second egg and, consequently, the young were
hatched out on successive days, it is difficult to be certain on this
point, but I make the time fifteen days from the laying of the first egg.
Nesting and Incubating. --So far as my observation goes, the cock

alone collected the material (in this instance hay and feathers, which
was all I provided them with) but the hen took her share in the actual
building. Both birds incubated in turn, and both were often on the
nest together, though never at night. They sat well and never left the
nest when it was approached. On the few occasions when they were
deliberately disturbed they seemed in no way perturbed, and returned
to the nest immediately.
Feeding the Young. --The parent Painted disdained meal worms
and fed the nestlings mainly on spray millet and seeding grasses,
together with such ant's cocoons as I supplied them with. They were
certainly on the look-out for these latter, and used a considerable
quantity during the first few days, but seemed less concerned about
them as the young developed. Rightly or wrongly, I have come to the
conclusion that they would rear young successfully without any live
insect food.
On the other hand, the young birds reared by the Bengalese were
fed mainly on milk-sop, which was supplied every morning and the
dish cleared by noon, after which spray millet, seeding grasses, and
ordinary canary and millet seed was used. In the case of Bengalese
foster-parents it is hardly necessary to add that these four young were
actually reared without live insect food of any kind, and there seems
to be little difference either in size or stamina between the young so
reared and the other three.
Nesting Site. --They seem to have no decided preference in this
direction, and are now incubating in a wire-netting cylinder stuffed
with straw, which they took possession of within an hour after it was
added to the other nesting boxes in their aviary.
Juvenile Plumage. --The young are all a dull replica of the adults,
lacking only the red breast stripes and any red on the head. The
breast spots are quite evident in all the young, and they also have a
considerable amount of red on the rumps. They, naturally, lack the
distinct black and brown of the parents, and, in general appearance,
are dull brown with the breast spots, though quite distinct, observable
only on closer examination. Both mandibles of the young are black,
and the bills less tapered than those of the adults.

J. E. Sweetnam--Breeding the Painted Finch
General Observations on the Species
I am at a loss to understand the long dissertation in the article by
Mr. Phillipps already referred to about the difficulty in sexing adult
birds. In my pair the distinction is evident at a glance, the cock carrying
much more and more brilliant red on breast and head and, I think,
with the breast spots rather smaller than the hen.
Another pair of, evidently, younger birds which I obtained at the
same time, but parted with later, also showed the sex quite distinctly,
and the same applies to several other pairs I have since seen.
In that same article the writer questions the fact that Painted
Finches always roost on the ground. Mine have never slept anywhere
else, and the young reared by them did likewise from the day they left
the nest.
It is, however, an interesting example of acquired characteristics
that the young reared by foster-parents never so roosted, but always
on top of a nest box, hung high up on the aviary wall.
For the first week or ten days the adult Painted roosted on the floor
with their young but, after that, by themselves though still on the ground.
Though conclusions reached from the observation of an individual
pair of birds of any species should be accepted with reserve (which,
in this case is the more necessary since my pair have never been moved
from the inside aviary, slightly heated all winter, and with some
heat turned on even now on cold nights), I regard Emblems, picta a
fairly hardy bird, nor have I found mine at all subject to egg-binding.
In regard to the latter complaint, however, it should be added I have
lost no birds through it for several seasons.
In view of recent importations of this previously very rare and,
apparently, very prolific species, it is probable this season will provide
many more records of its successful breeding. If so, I hope they may
be communicated through the Magazine for the benefit of future owners
of a bird which I am satisfied needs only to be better known and more
easily obtainable to become a prime favourite with aviarists.
I would add that a brief description of the species by Mr. Seth-Smith
in Yol. X (1932) of the Magazine is accompanied by an excellent
plate--though the immature bird there depicted must be several
months old to show such definite breast spots, and so much red on
the forehead and lower mandible.

By F. E. Matthews
The one who has possessed the&apos; Avicultubal Magazine for many
years has a treasure--a mine of information, and one says, " Let-
knowledge grow from more to more. 55 As its membership increases,,
the privilege is extended to many who, though keen aviculturists,.
cannot aspire to own many of the birds described by 45 Highbrows "&apos;
and breeders of long standing.
May I venture to suggest that there are many who like myself are-
momentarily content to say
" Small things are best . . .
But little things.
On little wings,"
and they gladly welcome information upon the methods of others----
their successes (and failures, too). It is always easier to write of our
successes--but possibly the whole story may be a warning to others !
To be prepared for misfortunes this year we provided some
Bengalese. So far their qualities as foster parents have not been tested,,
but their own families have steadily increased.
Through various causes the Gouldians did not nest last year.
Now the cock has just emerged from a long moult into splendid,
plumage, and the hen who had been in form has plunged into moult.
Taking counsel with one who knows the ways of Gouldians, Mr. Teague-
says, " Have patience." There are no marvels to relate about Melbas--
a very fine cock lost his mate in the early spring. Young Diamond
Sparrows seem likely to mate up ; having been bred at home they are
healthy. A pair of White Javas have a nest of four fine birds. Diamond
Doves have reared two birds in their quiet way, and two other pairs
have nests hatching out.
All seemed prosperous with two pairs of Longtailed Grass Finches,
who had an aviary to themselves, one pair choosing a home-made
cone-shaped rush nest placed in the fork of a branch high up in the
shelter, and the other a Keston finch-box. Knowing these birds must -

be left severely alone, I carried out this precaution so far as to be
unaware of which nests out of several the pairs had chosen. I did not
scent trouble until I noticed one hen was constantly out with the
two cocks. To my dismay on looking, I found the hen in the Keston
box was dead. She had laid a few eggs, and the " restless one " was the
mother of four nestlings. In spite of repeated admonitions from her
mate she continued to amuse herself, and the babies who had started
well were making no sound, and were all unfed--by another day all
would have died.
What to do ? The Bengalese could not be called in at this stage.
I decided to bring them indoors and hand feed. One bird was about
a week old showing signs of feather, and the smallest, just out, would
have gone into a thimble. The date was 4th June. Their new home was
a little rush basket. In three weeks all could use their wings, and the
older ones fly round the room. They can seed-feed themselves now,
and do. But they see fit to call out directly they see me for their
former diet. Sitting close together on a perch in a large cage, they keep
eyes fixed on my movements. When all is ready out they come, the
older ones taxiing round in a circle to descend to my hand--sometimes
they overshoot the mark. Then they stand in a circle on the floor
waiting to be picked up. They are very easy to feed, possessing small
tongues which resemble the stamen of a flower, they use these to great
purpose and lose very little. Their parents are hatching another family
meanwhile (the unattached cock having been removed all should
go well). Few people will trouble to hand feed--resign themselves to
the loss. Should any reader have Finches more valuable than mine
which they desire to save by hand feeding, I will gladly outline my
methods for them.

(Euphonia violacea)
By Mrs. K. Drake
The Violet Tanagers are charming wee birdies whose habitat is
the region of Guiana, Lower Amazonia, and South-East Brazil. I have
always looked upon them as little delicate birds, but for two years
my pair have spent most of their days in an outdoor aviary and by
no means in a sheltered position, being brought into a cold greenhouse
for about four to four and a half months during the damp cold weather
of our Cornish winter.
The birds have always shown an interest in the nesting of the other
birds in the adjoining aviaries, and this spring I wondered whether
the nesting material was not quite to their liking, so ventured to make
an " abode of love " in their presence for them. They appeared to
take a lively interest in my handiwork ; I fixed it into a wire frame,
made a dome of hay, and camouflaged it, then hung it up 3 feet from
the ground in a rather lovely honeysuckle. * I then threw down hay,
horsehair, and dried leaves, but something was not quite to their liking
and they distinctly asked me for more---hence I dubbed them Oliver
and Oliviera Twist. I then went off, feeling a bit hurt, in search
of bamboo leaves, those fine ones. I took up an armful and threw
them down in their flight, that caused quite a commotion, they were
on it like a bit of greased lightning ! I left them severely alone for a
few days but could not help noticing the nest was piling up, and only
a tiny opening left--however, " All's well that ends well." I gave
them their usual food of fruit, a few meal-worms (which were rarely
taken), insectivorous food, and also milk sop, which they had daily
as they always seemed to me delicate. Eggs were soon laid ; but I never
interfered with the birds--she was sitting--as I missed her and there
I left it. About the 27th May the meal-worms disappeared and con-
tinued to do so, so I decided that by the 1st or 2nd June the young
were certainly hatched.
About the 21st June, the parents made such a fuss if I went near
the honeysuckle that I decided my presence was extremely objection-
able to them, so I kept away from that part as much as the small

aviary would allow me. On Sunday, the 27th June, I went up early
to feed the birds as usual and then it was I noticed a fine little
bird hopping about the honeysuckle, and not in the least bit
afraid of me, and the parents also made no fuss then. All was
peace once more. After the young bird was out a few days there were
hardly any meal-worms eaten, and they seem to be clean off them now.
Prom the 8th July the little bird has fed itself entirely, also catching
all its own flies. Its colouring is greyish green above and yellowish
whitish green underneath, dark eyes and beak with white marks at
the sides of beak near the base.
The parent cock is a delightful singer, possessing a pretty little
voice, not at all harsh, but when in a tantrum no one could say the
voice was sweet ! No, not even I could say that.
I do hope the parents will go to nest again so that I can then tell
you the colour of their eggs. I could find no egg-shell anywhere this
time, and the only thing left in the nest when the fine little youngster
had flown was one dried-up tiny mite about four or five days old.
To-day, 12th July, I trod on my Samoyed " Marco's " tail and a
little came off, so I took the little bunch up to the Tanagers' aviary
and pushed it through the wire, and to-night it is already reposing
as a floor covering in the " Abode of love "--my hope for a second
nest has risen. In any case I consider I have been well repaid for the
tiny building I made for the home of my dear little Violet Tanagers.

Judging from my own interest in similar articles I think an account
of the birds occupying the aviaries in my garden at present may interest
other members. During the last two years I have built several new
aviaries and divided some of the old ones into smaller compartments,
I have also somewhat reduced the number of birds ; the idea being to
give the more interesting pairs an aviary to themselves as far as possible

to encourage breeding. This ideal arrangement has not of course been
possible altogether, and though larger enclosures have had to house
mixed collections as before, they are none of them crowded for
a change.
No. 1 Aviary is built of 1 in. mesh chain-link wire and has two
compartments, the first contains my old hen Purple-capped Lory ;
she regularly lays two clutches of eggs and tries to incubate them.
I had great hopes of getting a mate for her this year but, in spite of a
permit to import one, I have so far failed to get hold of a cock bird.
It appears that since the Parrot Ban, and consequent lack of demand
the Lories are now difficult to obtain even in places like Singapore
where they were once plentiful in the bird market. The other compart-
ment contains my Toro Toucan, also a hen and a most delightful pet,
playful and intelligent and always in perfect condition ; her staple
food consists of soaked " Winalot " dog biscuit and fruit, banana,
grapes, and apple cut into cubes.
No. 2 Aviary houses a breeding pair of Spreo Starlings by them-
selves ; last year they were in a mixed aviary and only reared one
youngster out of a nest of four, they are now sitting on four eggs and
I shall probably be able to give them partial liberty during the rearing
period. They are a nice tame pair, both taking live food from my fingers.
Next door to the Spreos, in No. 8 Aviary, are a pair of Red-faced
Lovebirds also by themselves, although I have not much hopes of
any breeding results from them ; last year this couple was often seen
pairing and the hen spent much time in a wooden nest-box but did
not lay. I think what they want is a really very hot spell of weather
to bring them into proper breeding condition.
Next to them is No. 9, one of my new aviaries and the largest ;
the shelter 12 by 6 feet and the flight 40 by 9 feet. The most interesting
occupants are a pair of Rufus-bellied Niltavas, most delightful birds,
tame and lovely to look upon, they are quite friendly and I have great
hopes that they may nest. A pair of Cherry Finches have built in
a bay bush and are sitting, a pair of G-ouldians are building in a nest-box,
a pair of Chestnut-breasted Finches nested in a " Hartz " cage, but the
eggs were clear. Two pairs of common Waxbills are also in this aviary
as possible foster parents for a pair of Queen Whydahs ; the hen

C. H. MacJclin--My Aviaries
Whydah laid last autumn and if the Waxbills nest the parasitical
breeding habits of the Whydahs might have a chance ; at any rate it is
an interesting experiment. A hen Malachite Sunbird completes this
collection, the long aviary gives her a chance of showing off her
extremely rapid powers of flight.
No. 4 Aviary has been divided into four small compartments each
about 10 by 4 feet. In the inner two are five pairs of Black-cheek
Lovebirds ; two pairs are sitting on four eggs each, in nest-boxes
hung in the flight ; my flock of these birds have reared over 100 young
ones in the last eight years. I must-confess I am getting a little tired
of them. Lovebirds are very stupid and in my experience hardly ever
get at all tame ; they are also occasionally murderous and cannibalistic,
not very lovable traits. The other two compartments of No. 4 contain
a Racket-tailed Drongo and a Blue Whistling Thrush, each by himself
of course. These two birds are both very tame and most amusing, they
both have a very loud whistle and are wonderful mimics. The Drongo
copies our Spaniel puppies' excited bark exactly and any other noises
in the house or garden. He recently escaped and spent an hour or
so flying round my neighbour's park ; he was a wonderul sight with
his two rackets trailing behind him as he indulged in aerobatics high
above the trees ; he came down when he was hungry and was enticed
home with meal worms.
No. 3 Aviary, 7 by 20 by 10 feet high contains a mixed lot; a very
tame Pied Rock Thrush, Magpie Tanager, Striated Tanager, Gaboon
Blue-bill Weaver, two cock Giant Whydahs, handsome birds now in
full colour with 15 in. tails, a pair of Pekin Robins in their seventh
year here ; my old cock Amethyst-rumped Sunbird, as lively as ever ;
Cape Paradise Whydah, Queen Whydah, two Greater St. Helena
Waxbills, and two Australian Plumed Ground Doves, the latter
attractive little birds are, I am afraid, both cocks, they occasionally
fly up and perch but spend most of the time on the ground, they have
an amusing display bowing low with their tails spread and raised behind.
The Gaboon Blue-bill is seldom seen, he prefers to hide his handsome
scarlet breast in the foliage and bushes at the back of the aviary.
The magpie Tanager is always on show, very spick and span in black

and white and always on the move, perfectly good tempered too with
the smaller birds.
No. 7 Aviary, 6 by 12 feet enclosing a large bay bush, contains an
old and tame pair of Silver Pheasants ; another couple of Australian
Plumed Ground Doves, also cocks I fear ; a pair of Bronze-wing
Pigeons which are very timid and wild and my second Blue Whistling
Thrush, these two thrushes can see each other across the garden and
try to out-whistle one another. When they and the Drongo really
get going the effect is remarkable.
No. 5, my original Waxbill aviary, with  |in. mesh netting comes next,
here are a pair of Purple Sugarbirds, the cock frequently displays to
his mate but so far I haven't seen any sign of nest building ; they
seem to stand this variable weather very well, but certainly seem most
comfortable on hot days. With them are a pair of Cuban Finches, sitting
on eggs in a coco-nut husk ; my old pair of Greater St. Helena Waxbills,
an odd cock Gouldian and Queen Whydah cock.
No. 6 Aviary is divided into two compartments each with a sub-
stantial brick shelter, and each cover about 10 by 5 feet including
flights ; in the outer division are a pair of Purple Starlings, I cannot
find out their exact species, they were sold to me as Purple-shouldered.
I am rather doubtful if they are a true pair, they have shown no sign
of nesting as yet.
The inner compartment is particularly well sheltered in the corner
of an old brick wall and here are my pair of South American Black
and White Woodpeckers. A most exciting event here, for yesterday,
15th June, they hatched two chicks after sitting fifteen days on three
white eggs ; I do not remember reading of any foreign Woodpeckers
breeding in captivity before so I am duly excited ; both parents seem
to be feeding the chicks to-day and I was able to get them a couple
of black meadow ant's nests to-day and hope to be able to keep up
a supply.
One more aviary, No. 10, built against the old garden wall, 25 by
5 feet, is intended for Pheasants. It contains at the moment an odd
Orange-headed Ground Thrush, and a game bantam with two baby
Elliott Pheasants.

One of the great assets of the Avicultural Society is the invitation,
extended to all members in May every year, by Mr. and Mrs. Ezra
to visit their country home at Foxwarren Park.
This year we had a particularly lovely day. The weather was perfect
.and we all very thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. On arrival Mr. Ezra,
always tireless in his efforts to show visitors his many feathered
treasures, himself conducted us to his aviaries. We walked through
shady garden and woodland paths, catching glimpses here and there of
Jungle Fowl and Chukar Partridges, now well established in the home
woods. Passing many beautiful old trees, we came to a long range of
aviaries, all planted with very large shrubs and conifers. This is a
paradise for birds in these large enclosures, their every comfort is
studied, and it is not surprising that every year our President is able
to claim the Society's medal for birds bred for the first time in captivity.
All are in superb condition and one could spend hours here and not hope
to see all the inmates. I have for several years much admired a Scissor-
tailed Tyrant, a most graceful and lovely bird from South America.
Many Wood Swallows flying about looked beautiful, and I noticed
the Blacksmith Plovers and Bichenow's Weavers that Mr. Ezra bred
for the first time last year ; also several species of Magpies, particularly
the Formosan Blue Magpie.
Presently, proceeding further, we came to a new acquisition--the
Mountain Bluebird, a glorious pair in an aviary to themselves. It
would be impossible to imagine anything more lovely, and it was
difficult to tear oneself away ! There are also pairs of the Western Blue-
bird, almost as beautiful. Passing the well-equipped Parrakeet and
Parrot aviaries, I noticed among many beauties the exquisite Princess
of Wales's Parrakeet from Australia, the most beautiful of all, a species
that is bred here every year.
Now we are conducted through more lovely gardens, skirting hard
tennis courts we pass back through the kitchen garden, where tempting
beds of strawberries soon ready to pick make one's mouth water.

a Tit-box and there we see ten baby Tits quite unconcerned and happy.
Very wonderful!
The Bird-room is next inspected--a large airy room opposite the
stables, where are housed many rare beauties, such as the New Guinea,
and Macklot's Pittas, the new' Wattle-eyed Flycatchers, Tinker Birds,
and rare Bobins.
From here the party return to the house for tea, where Mr. and
Mrs. Ezra, assisted by two daughters, one a Coronation debutante,
are most kind and hospitable in ministering to the wants of the large
number of guests. I need hardly add that the very best of everything
is put before us.
After tea the Waterfowl, Cranes, Deer, etc., are visited. While this
was going on I decided to rest on the terrace, and thoroughly enjoy
and appreciate the garden. The south side of the house overlooks very
beautiful terraced gardens. There I found a shady seat and listened to
the five Indian Nightingales placed some under standard rhododendrons,
others at the top of a flight of garden steps ; all were in true Indian
manner enclosed in cages completely covered with spotless white calico.
Hidden in this manner they all sang almost incessantly--beautifully
sweet notes. While listening enchanted I sat and enjoyed the very
lovely garden, running down in many terraces to a formal pool below,
where one could see massed tall tulips shown off by brightest red-
leaved Japanese maples. Indeed, the planting of this beautiful dell
is the work of a garden artist. There are golden and silver conifers,
copper beeches, laburnums--a sheet of yellow, and many other trees in
lovely tints of green, all combining to make a beautiful picture, and to
accentuate this, on a green surrounding an old-world summer-house,
are a flock of Demoiselle Cranes grazing ; while I feast my eyes I further
notice on the opposite corner of the dell a cool-looking informal pond, *
where, in its sunniest part, grow pink water-lilies. Over my head Indian
Doves fly to and fro, Norwich Croppers display on the lawn close to me,
and the beautiful Modena Pigeons alight and show off their trim little
shape. Presently I walk down to the terrace below and on the warm
south walls are sheets of Clianthus like lobster-claws growing on the
wall, Carpentaria Californica, covered with yellow flowers, and
Leptospernum, with thousands of tiny Bose du Barri stars. At the end

of this terrace, in half-shade, were many beautiful camellias, now
almost over, some gay azaleas, and a large plantation of Rhododendron
Alice.
By this time the party were returning to the house, where further
delicious refreshments were handed round. Soon afterwards it was time
to bid farewell to our kind hosts, and we did so feeling very grateful,
and all agreed that we had had a most enjoyable day.

By The Marquess of Tavistock.
A few weeks ago a nestling Starling, only just beginning to feather,
was found on the floor of the outer part of the garage. How he came
there and how he escaped serious injury by a fall on the hard concrete
floor remains a mystery, but uninjured he was and, being adopted
by the cook, he soon lost his nervousness and opened at frequent
intervals a large mouth vociferously demanding nourishment. A day
or two later a brother, similarly unclothed, was found in the same odd
situation and joined Wilberforce in his box, being named by my son
" Jarge ". Jarge from the first lacked his brother's confiding disposition,
and it was nearly two days before he would open his beak freely to
be fed.
Not long afterwards, when the young Starlings were fledging, they
were moved during the cook's temporary absence to one of the heated
bird-rooms--probably too warm a situation for such hardy birds.
Adult Starlings are noted for their fondness for bathing, but I must
say I was surprised when Jarge and Wilberforce started to bathe even
before they were properly able to fly or had begun to feed themselves.
Jarge throve and soon began to pick up for himself, but on being put
back in the kitchen after his mistress's return Wilberforce went wrong.
Whether the egg we were giving was too rich or whether he caught a
chill I do not know, but he got very thin and, though calling incessantly
as if hungry, he would hardly eat at all. A change of diet seemed to be
indicated and after a few experiments small quantities of worms

killed by immersion in boiling water appeared to be what was needed.
Live worms, however, Wilberforce at this time regarded as a most
uncivilized diet and would have nothing to do with. Jarge, plump,
lively, alert, and distinctly shy, was given his liberty and, like the Raven
from the ark, he returned no more. Wilberforce, however, when his
turn came, assumed the role of the Dove. On a rather plainer diet he
made a steady, if slow, recovery, and when let out of his cage he entirely
refused to desert his human benefactor. He still flies about the garden
in the daytime, but allows himself to be taken back to his cage at night.
He is absolutely fearless, settling on the head or shoulder of any person
he sees, coming when he is called, and rightly showing a special regard
for his original benefactress. He feeds himself quite a lot, but has no
objection to extras in the house. When sitting on one's hand he often
inserts his closed beak between one's fingers and then opens it with the
prising action characteristic of his tribe when hunting a pasture for
worms or grubs. What will be his future ? Probably, I fear, capture
by some stranger or a violent death from cat, Hawk, or Owl or, sadder
still, a fatal injury from a friend's heedless foot which he is too confiding
to avoid. In the meantime, however, he is rather nice.

This very remarkable bird was described in 1894 by Dr. A. B.
Meyer of the Dresden Museum in the following papers : Zwei neue Para-
disvogel Abh. in Ber. Ker. zool. u. anthrop. Mus . Dresden , 1894-5, 1894-5,
No. 5, and in the year 1895 Lord Rothschild sent for exhibition to the
British Ornithologist Union two examples of this bird. We have in
the National History Museum Collection three specimens, one of which
is on exhibition in the Central Hall; there is another set up in the Bird
Room at the Zoology Museum at Cambridge. It is very rare but perhaps
one day Mr. Shaw Mayer may bring us back from New Guinea living
examples of this bird. Nothing is known of its habits. Its habitat is
the Amberno Mountains near Geelrink Bay in North-West New Guinea.

Italians can now congratulate themselves on possessing a really
up-to-date and practical book on Pheasants, which will teach them
how to keep, breed, and rear game birds in captivity in the best
possible way.
The book describes each species and race and concludes with a
study of their lives in freedom and captivity w T ith much excellent
advice for keeping them in health and inducing them to lay and rear
their young.
The last seven chapters deal with Pheasants in pheasantries, their
requirements and food, accommodation, breeding, and rearing their

of artificial breeding.
Professor Ghigi has owned one of the finest collections of Pheasants
in the world for over forty years, and this long experience qualifies him
to advise and instruct those amateurs who wish to keep Pheasants
in the best way and to the best advantage. There are also many
illustrations which will be found very helpful. In short this book is
indispensable to phasianists and all who wish to try their hand at
breeding these beautiful and interesting birds.
An English translation is much to be desired for the benefit of those
of us who cannot read Italian.

Before the issue of this number of the Avicultural Magazine,
the O.P.S. will have held its Annual Summer General Meeting and
Tea Party. A report of this meeting will appear in the next number,
but I take this opportunity of thanking the Zoological Society for
placing their Council Boom at our disposal and also for allowing our
members free access to the Gardens. This was exceedingly kind and
generous of the Society and we appreciate it. When the O.P.S. was first
formed it was felt by some members of the A.S. that the O.P.S. had
been formed as a breakaway from your Society. Of course this was
quite ridiculous. Now it is obvious to all that far from this being the
case, we are anxious to work in the closest harmony with such an
illustrious Society as yours, and, furthermore, it can be truthfully
said that complete and happy harmony prevails and it will always
be so.
The July number of the O.P.S. Journal has been well received and
perhaps especially on the Continent. As your members have been
informed this issue, and as will be the case in the future, was translated
and printed in the French language as well as English, and this was

sent to all Pheasant fanciers in France and Belgium. As a result of this
action I can now report a happy increase in our membership and this
is most satisfactory. We have as regional secretaries in France and
Belgium, Mr. F. E. Fooks, of Cleres, and Monsieur Malisoux, of Namur,
and the thanks of our Society are due to these two spirited members
who came forward to help us ; they have to carry the burden of corre-
sponding with all French-speaking members. Even so I am rather
alarmed at the number of letters I am receiving in French, although
having only left school a few years, perhaps I should not feel unduly
flustered, but the fact remains that I am.

SUCCESSFUL REARING OF THE WESTERN
BLUE BIRD
(Sialia mexicana)
By A. Ezra

<bodyText confidence="0.997164529411765" page_id="56322129"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
There are three species of Blue Birds ( Sialis) in North America.
The Eastern Blue Bird (Sialia sialis) well known to aviculture, which
ranges all over the country east of the Bocky Mountains, migrating
south in winter (with local races in the south). The Western Blue
Bird (Sialia mexicana) of the Pacific States, and the Mountain Blue
Bird (Sialia currucoides), which inhabits the high mountains of the
west, and is quite a different looking bird. The Western Blue Bird
differs from his Eastern relative. His throat being blue instead of
reddish-brown, while a necklace of the same colour extends right
round the neck ; the blue parts of the plumage are also of a deeper
and brighter hue. The Western Blue Bird is rather common along
the coast of the Pacific State and British Columbia, and does not
migrate to any great extent, although it goes up to 10,000 feet in the
mountains. In its shape, habits, and voice, it is very similar to the
Eastern Blue Bird.
As far as I know, the Western Bluebird has never been imported
before, and those that I had were brought over by Mr. Delacour last

244 C. H. Macklin--Breeding the White-headed Woodpecker
spring. A pair of these were put into one of my small breeding aviaries,
which they had to themselves. The nest box was hung about 8 feet
from the floor in the sleeping quarters of the aviary. The box was
12 inches high and 8 inches square, with entrance hole 2 inches
from the top. The nest was built of dried grass, moss, and a few feathers.
The first egg was laid on 27th May, and five eggs were laid by the
31st May. Only the hen was seen to incubate. Five young were hatched
out by 12th June. All left the nest on 3rd July, a particularly strong
and healthy lot of young. Two days after leaving the nest the young
were observed eating ants' eggs. The young were reared on fresh
ants eggs and gentles only, although fresh insectivorous food, which
was given daily, was never touched. The ants eggs were mixed with
dry earth, and this was continually raked over so that a good supply
of eggs kept coming to the surface. The young resemble the young
of Sialia sialis.

The successful breeding in captivity of this bird is, I think, an
event of some importance in the avicultural world, for I can find no
record of any other British or foreign Woodpecker having nested.
A short description of this handsome bird may not be out of place
as they are not very commonly imported. There is a rather poor
drawing of the bird in Butler's Foreign Birds for Cage and Aviary ,
and he records that the Zoological Society received a specimen in
1871. The adult bird is about 12 inches long, white head and body ;
black back and wings ; black tail barred with white ; bare skin round
the eye, lemon yellow ; a pale yellow patch on the abdomen, paler
in the hen, and in the cock only, a yellow splash on the back of the neck ;
beak and feet black ; a black line extending from the eye to the back

of the neck. The young bird has no yellow on the abdomen or eye
ring but shows the patch on the nape as it is a young cock.
I obtained my pair from the Zoological Gardens, where they were
on deposit in the Bird House in January, 1937. I understand that
another member of the Society had them in an aviary during the
previous summer. They were in beautiful condition and I exhibited
them at the " Crystal Palace 55 Show at Dorland Hall and at the Foreign
Bird League Show at Nottingham. They were quite tame, both taking
mealworms from my fingers. I fed them on insectivorous food,
" Mosquito " and fruit, banana, apple, and grapes ; they take quite
a large quantity of fruit and so are easier to cater for than some of
the more insectivorous species.
They were kept in a cage in my bird-room until April. They did a
good deal of damage to the woodwork but spent most of their time
demolishing the natural oak bark with which I lined the cage. Owing
to the large amount of fruit in their diet, they were rather dirty but
kept themselves quite spotless with frequent baths.
On 19th April I put them in one of my outdoor aviaries which I
was able to give them to themselves. This aviary is built in a corner
with the back and one side against old brick walls, completely sheltering
it from the north and east. The 3ize is about 14 by 7 feet and 6 feet
high ; half the area is open flight, the other half a brick-built shelter.
I lined all the woodwork and the brick walls with bark and with outside
boards with the bark still in place. In the flight I placed an old hollow
apple tree trunk and on the wall of the flight hung up a wooden box
covered and lined inside with bark, 2 ft. 3 in. high, 1 foot wide,
8 inches back to front, with a sloping roof and a hole under the
eaves of the roof in front.
I put in a few apple branches and fir poles, both horizontal and
upright, for perches.
The Woodpeckers immediately inspected the tree trunk and the
box and took to the latter for roosting purposes, having slightly enlarged
the entrance hole.
On 29th May the first egg was laid in the box. They had made no
nest at all and the bottom of the box contained only a few chips of
bark. On 3rd June there were four eggs in the box, but one was only

half size and I removed it. They were glossy white and rather small
for the size of the birds. The bottom of the box was flat, so I put a
handful or so of coarse sawdust under the eggs to stop them rolling
about. Both cock and hen took turns at sitting and did not come off
when the aviary was entered for feeding, etc.
On 15th June two eggs hatched ; the third was infertile.
Next day I started a supply of ants 5 eggs and heard the young birds
squeaking when fed. The cock bird did most of the feeding while
the hen brooded the chicks at night. For the first week they fed them
chiefly on mealworms and ants' eggs, but also seemed to take beakfuls
of soft food into the nest. After feeding they removed the excreta and
dropped it at the end of the flight. On 21st June the two chicks were
still naked, skin pale pinkish-white, but were just showing tail quills.
A week later their bodies were darker and the wing quills showing.
2nd July, body feathers just showing. On 8th July one of the chicks
was dying, its abdomen was swollen and inflamed. The other chick
was bigger and stronger.
On 15th July the young bird was well feathered and was showing
the lemon yellow cock's patch on the back of the head.
On 21st July, at thirty-six days old, the young bird came out of the
nest hole and sat on the top of the box for a short while before popping
back into the nest. Three days later he was flying strongly about
the aviary. He was nearly as big as his parents and his plumage was
the same as theirs except that he had no yellow on the abdomen and the
bare skin round the eyes was pale blue instead of yellow.
He spent a good deal of time in the nest and roosted there at night.
15th August, the young bird is now feeding himself and seems well
established ; he is now almost as big as his father.

By R. F. Tong
The greatest thrill to any collector of living and inanimate objects
is to secure a rare specimen that heretofore has never been obtained by
anyone else. I have not yet experienced such a thrill in collecting live
birds in China during my eighteen months' residence here, in spite of
which, nevertheless, I hope to experience that some day.
However, I have had my share of happiness in obtaining birds which
were a near approach to the " never been secured alive " species,
many of which, I believe, have rarely been seen in London. To quote
a few samples, how many readers of the Avicultural Magazine
have seen an Ince's Paradise Flycatcher, a pure albino Dayal Thrush,
or the Scarlet-breasted Flowerpecker (.Dicaeum i. ignipectus) ? These,
as well as many others, some of which I am still attempting to identify,
I have in my aviaries here in Macao, South China. Many I have sent
to private aviaries in Honolulu and America.
Recently I obtained a bird which appeared to be a relative of the
Pekin Robin, but about one-third larger, with the following description:
length, 7J inches ; chest and abdomen, yellow ; forehead, bright
reddish orange ; back from forehead to rump, greyish ; rump, yellow ;
outer tail feathers, bright orange ; inner tail feathers, black ; wings,
dark with centre parts of wings bright reddish orange ; feet and beak,
dark greyish. After keeping it in the aviary for a week it died through
negligence on my part in not supplying it with sufficient live grass-
hoppers, its favourite food. The dead bird was sent to experienced
naturalists at the Hong Kong University for identification, but so far,
after a diligent search among all the books on China birds, it appears
that no such species has yet been recorded in any of the books. The
authorities are still checking on the bird.
My method of collecting birds in China has been rather simple.
I do not attempt personally, or with an expedition, to secure the birds
from their natural environments, but simply visit the various " bazaars "
on market days in the various villages scattered throughout Southern
</bodyText>

China. The Chinese villages each have an official market day designated
in advance to avoid conflicting days among the villages in a group.
Usually, one village holds a market day once every three or four days.
On this day all the peasants display their wares in open stalls or on
the sides of narrow streets at the market for sale. Potatoes, firewood,
rice, fish, live snakes, clams, preserved eggs, fowls, pigs, beans, fire-
crackers--practically everything that is grown, caught, or manu-
factured, is brought to be sold. Some will stay the whole day to sell
a few pennies 5 worth of some commodity, and the next day bring
their supplies to the bazaar scheduled in the next village. Others who
are fortunate to sell all their wares early will then go " window
shopping 55 (windowless shopping is more accurate), at the other
vendors', buying whatever necessities are needed.
I visit these markets whenever opportunity affords, looking for
any live gems that may be offered for sale by the bird traders. The visit
to these market places itself is a holiday, and when I find some particular
collection of birds that suits my fancy, my happiness is complete. I
must always bear in mind, however, the important requisite of hiding
my joy until out of sight of the traders or the next time the price will
be doubled.
Live birds offered for sale may be classed in two categories--those
raised by hand from nestlings and those which are trapped. Of the two
I always prefer the former as they are used to human contact and will
be hardy and improve in health once given proper food and environ-
ment. Many rare birds, however, do not nest in the surrounding country,
but are migrants from the north or south. These are trapped and I
purchase them also. The majority of the birds offered for sale are young
birds, taken from the nest and hand fed. This is because the Chinese
peasant is usually ignorant of bird culture, and unaccustomed food is
given the newly trapped bird, which usually dies of starvation.
With young birds, the Chinese appear to have developed a crude
art in rearing them to adult stage. Birds ranging in size from Thrushes,
Wahmees, and Bulbuls, up to the larger species, are fed on shelled
boiled shrimp and boiled dried silkworms, chopped fine enough to be
swallowed by the fledgelings. The food is dipped into water and fed by
hand or by impaling the piece of shrimp on a thin bamboo stick and

inserting it into the gaping mouth of the young bird. The smaller
birds are fed on insectivorous wet paste made from bean powder mixed
with ground dried shrimp, silkworm, and other insects, and water,
on the thin stick also. All the young birds appear to thrive on their
food and grow rapidly into maturity. When they are able to pick their
own food, their diet is gradually changed to whatever is their favourite
foods or seeds.
Most birds purchased in China are seasonal. The Pekin Robins
which Mr. Sydney Porter describes as " inevitable " in all the Chinese
bird shops at Hong Kong and Shanghai, are there for sale only during
the last four months of the year. During the other months very few,
if any, can be had, unless some fancier tires of a particular bird and sells
it back to the bird store. At this time of the year, July, there are various
species of Owls, Magpies, Orioles, Thrushes, White-eyes, Blackbirds,
Starlings, Finches, Larks, a few Buntings (season over), a sprinkling
of Wahmees (season approaching), Flowerpeckers, Cuckoos, Barbets,
Tits, Shrikes, Bulbuls, Babblers, Kingfishers, and others. I am now
compiling notes on the months when various species of birds are in
season and will write regarding them later. During season time, the
common species are collected in great numbers and one can easily
collect as many as desired to supply the wants of all aviculturists.
The manner in which I obtained the unidentified bird mentioned in
the early part of this article is typical of the method used in buying
birds from the Chinese traders. Calling at a village on one of my periodic
visits, one collector who always awaits my profitable (to him) trips,
offered with some excitement to show me a bird which he claimed to be a
beautiful specimen of some rare Chinese species, privately owned by a
bird fancier. No one knew its identity, including the owner, who secured
it, when a young bird, from a trader in one of the near-by villages. My
collector ventured a confidential tip (obtained through the mysterious
grape-vine gossip among the traders), on what the man originally paid
for the bird and mentioned his opinion as to the price the owner might
be willing to sell the bird. Confident that this collector, who is familiar
with my desires, would not give me a false steer, my heart as usual
began throbbing with excitement in anticipation of something unex-
pected.

250 E. F. Tong--Some Notes on Bird Collecting in Southern China
Upon arrival I immediately noted the beauty of the bird, and knew
that here was a rare find. I had never seen such a bird before, and could
not place its identification.
After the customary introduction, I said to the owner, " A very
common bird, just a variation in colour of the lowly Pekin Kobin."
Kaising his voice excitedly, the man responded, " This bird is a very
rare one. I don't know its name, but I paid an enormous price for it. It
is the only one here among all the surrounding villages. Should you take
this bird for a walk around here, everyone will recognize it as mine."
Evidently he must have taken the bird out regularly for walks about
the streets, as is the usual custom among Chinese bird fanciers. Every
day in the cities, from dawn to dark, one invariably meets Chinese men
and boys, some in rags and others in silk, taking their birds out for a
walk. This is done, in my opinion, for three reasons : to familiarize
the bird with humans, to exhibit his beautiful specimen, and because
the owner needs exercise himself (least probable).
He continued, " I wouldn't part with him for all the jades of Canton,
only that I am not very well, and he eats too many grasshoppers."
At this juncture he caught a grasshopper from a small bamboo cage
filled with the jumping creatures and offered it to the bird, which
accepted same eagerly. He went on, " As a great favour, however, I
shall let you have it for $50.00, Hong Kong currency, which is exactly
what I paid for it."
My collector and I both kept from laughing, and with a serious
expression I voiced my disinterestedness in paying that price. After
the usual bargaining conversation I offered him my final price, and then
departed without the bird. A few hours later I sent the collector over,
and he brought the bird back to me at the figure recommended to me
by my collector, which was my " last " price.

Although I have had four of these most attractive birds for some
years, I have never been lucky enough to breed any. They have nested
before, but each time unsuccessfully. This summer one pair, in one
of my large aviaries, built a nest on the top of a Cupressus. The nest
was made of dried grass, so roughly that had it not been supported
by me with some twigs that I placed under it during incubation, it
would have fallen to pieces. Two eggs were laid by the 1st July.
Colour of eggs pale grey, heavily speckled with red and brown spots.
Two young hatched out on 13th July, and both left the nest thoroughly
reared on the 27th July. Colour of young black, wings and tail slaty-
grey, underparts white, head black, cheeks and throat very pale red,
beak and legs slaty-grey. The young were fed on mealworms, gentles,
and insectivorous food, and the parents had access to mixed seed, but
they were never seen to feed the young after eating seed. As I write
this on the 4th August, the two young are very strong on the wing,
and feed themselves well. I believe this is the first time this Cardinal
has been reared in captivity.

A CROSS-BRED STANLEY x ROSELLA

<bodyText confidence="0.934352166666667" page_id="56322137"  page_num="251" year="" vol="">
Some years ago I was offered a newly imported pair of Stanley
Parrakeets and accepted them at once, for it had long been my wish
to possess a pair of these most beautiful and elegant examples of the
genus Platycerus. When the birds arrived, in good plumage and excellent
health, there was a noticeable difference in their colouring : the one,
obviously an old male, was clad in the deepest, most velvety scarlet.

while the other was paler and had a yellowish tinge. It certainly
was not sealing-wax red, as a female Stanley should be.
My belief that it was also a male not yet in colour turned out to
be correct, but the birds were so good that I kept them both and ordered
two more Stanleys from an experienced man, which he believed to be
two hens. He undertook to take them back if neither bird turned out
to be a female. Unluckily both these too were males and after a pro-
longed examination I sent them back. After a time I sold the old
male, and after some years was able to pair it with a breeding hen
Stanley with which it bred good healthy birds.
Two years before this it paired with a young Rosella hen which
was wintered with him in a garden aviary. He fed and courted her
*even then in mild weather ; and at the beginning of May she laid six
fertile eggs which, however, were forsaken shortly before the young
were due to hatch. Soon after she laid a second clutch of four eggs
also fertile, although by that time the male had begun to moult. But
this time I was prepared and the two remaining eggs were put under
Budgerigars (the other eggs had been crushed). After twenty days an
egg was hatched and luckily was well fed at once on sop. Besides this,
if it had not had much from its foster-parents, I gave it a little millet
meal moistened with raw egg and mixed with fresh ants' eggs, meal-
worm juice, minced liver, and charcoal, also fine gravel, crushed oats,
and " Spratts ". The nestling took this food willingly : it was, of course,
made fresh every day and given warm, and it lived on a coarser prepara-
tion of it exclusively by the time it was three weeks old. Its development
was normal as this table shows.

Newly hatched Stanleys and Rosellas are alike and naturally it
was the same with the hybrid. Its skin, beak, legs, and feet were
flesh coloured, its claws and egg tooth white, and its long thick down
was whitish. At five days' old its eyes opened to a narrow slit, and at
seven days the feet turned reddish-grey and the egg tooth fell off. Two
days later its beak turned whiter, and two days later still its claws were
grey with lighter tips. At thirteen days the first down appeared and
three days later the dark grey down robe was complete. Tiny quills
were now everywhere visible and at four weeks' old the bird was nearly
full feathered. At seventy days its beak began to turn blue-grey
beginning at the base.
Its youthful colouring was pale and dull. Taken altogether the
bird decidedly resembles a Stanley, especially above. Its forehead is
strawberry colour, its scalp darker and the feathers edged with yellow.
The back of its head greenish yellow, with a few red spots, and at the
sides a narrow red stripe. Ear patches greenish yellow. The cheek
mark is dirty blue and white, the same shape and size as the Rosella's.
Round the eyes yellowish grey. Neck and back feathers black, edged
blue. Rump and middle tail feathers green, and wing spot blue. Throat
pale red, mingled with green, feathers yellow edged. Green crop, feathers
red edged in parts, breast and belly green, under tail coverts red. On
the under side from the thighs to the middle of the breast there is a
narrow red stripe. Its eyes are dark brown, beak blue grey with
lighter tip, legs and feet reddish grey, claws grey.
With the first moult, which takes place when the bird is about
seventy-five days old and only includes the small feathers, its colouring
cleared and it grew redder, especially on the head and belly. At seven
months' old it underwent a full moult, beginning with the tail feathers.
After this the bird grew red-edged feathers on its back and more red
generally, the red belly stripe also was broader.
The nestling food cry was at first a weak " Wee ", later " djuck " ;
if the sop was too hot it screamed loudly " jick ". After it was fledged
and was begging for some dainty such as a bit of apple it went back
to " Wee ". This is also the note with which adult Stanley and Rosella
hens demand their mates to feed them. The hybrid sang when only

thirty-five days old, while cuddling in my hand. Later, it sang freely,
although it turned out to be a hen ; but after some time it left off
altogether. I have noticed that other Rosella hens sing occasionally,
but they leave off after a time as a rule.
At thirty-two days old the youngster took its first short flight,
but the next day it flew intentionally to the food pot and the next
back again on to my hand. At forty days old it fed itself entirely. It
bathed very thoroughly every day.
It was very amusing when it made friends with a male Blue-rump
X Pigmy Parrot. The two were always together and even after they had
been separated for some months recognized each other ; the hybrid
took no notice of three other tame Pigmy Parrots, but always came
at once to its friend's cage and remained near. When they were let out
they flew about together in the room and presently the Pigmy began
to try and feed its big friend, which then took up the mating position.
If the Pigmy was annoyed it flew on the hybrid's back and put him
rapidly to flight. It did this even when only just fledged. This conduct
did not put an end to their friendship, the hybrid always came back
until I separated the unequal pair in the following year and gave them
away.
The following summer the hybrid and a male Stanley reared one
young one.

A few weeks ago a neighbour's boy brought me a young Mocking-
bird. The approach of a prowling cat, heralded loudly by the bird's
angry parents, had prompted the fledgelings to jump out of their nest,
which strangely enough was set high in a black acacia tree. So the
boy had found one of the young birds, which was unable to fly and
which he mistook for a young Shrike.
Realizing that it would very probably mean certain death for the

fledgeling if I placed him back in the nest, I decided to raise him as
best I could. Fortunately I had on hand an ample supply of meal-
worms and beetles, for I know well that a certain daily amount of live
food is indispensable to the well-being of all insectivorous birds,
especially young ones.
On the first day the unkempt little bird refused stubbornly to open
his beak when I offered him small pieces of bread soaked in lukewarm
goat's milk, mealworms, and other delicacies ; so I had to open it
myself each time--a rather delicate task. On the very next morning,
however, the bird changed his tactics. Eagerly he took most of the
food offered, showing a decided preference for worms and beetles,
which, after suitable preparation, I fed him by means of small tweezers.
Within a few days this young Mocker began to call loudly and raucously
for food the moment I came near his roomy cage. His eating capacity
seemed to grow daily. Being fed generously several times an hour,
from early morning till evening, the clumsy little fellow soon grew
into a graceful and slender bird that was wholly tame within and
without the cage, that is, of course, indoors.
After approximately ten days' patient care, the Mocking-bird began
to take a keen interest in the worms and beetles placed in his cage
and soon learned to pick them up, kill them, and swallow them. His
favourite drink was goat's milk. Even at his tender age--the bird was
not yet two months old--he liked to bathe, splashing to his heart's
content in the flat pan placed outside his cage for this important
purpose. What surprised me most, however, was the fact that this
youngster should attempt to sing so very early in life : sitting contentedly
on the highest perch, he would begin very softly and continue for a
few minutes, as if practising.
As soon as the bird commanded the full use of his wings, I placed
him in a large outdoor aviary for a few days, preparatory to giving
him his liberty. Here he exercised his wings continually and almost
immediately assumed the behaviour of a bird which had never been
tame. As a matter of fact, he now refused to take mealworms from
my hand and objected most strenuously to being touched or caught.
What a sudden and complete change in behaviour ! It seemed as if
the bird had never been tame. Whereas in the cage he had been gentle

and never afraid of me or any other member of the household, in the
aviary he flew about anxiously, the while calling to others of his kind.
So I banded the youngster and let him fly in the garden, hoping that
he would be able to maintain himself.
Though this young bird proved quite a responsibility, necessitating
someone's staying at home practically all day to feed him regularly,
he was worth all time and effort given him, for he adjusted himself
very quickly to his artificial surroundings and the sudden change in
diet. Best of all, he taught his keeper much about the care and the
feed on which immature Mocking-birds thrive. Great was the keeper's
joy recently upon seeing his charge in the garden as he helped himself
to some ripe young berries, the little metal leg-band making recognition
quite certain.

Two such crosses obtained this year are worth record. The first is
the Pigmy Dove X Talpacoti Dove, and was bred in my aviary at
Balcombe. The mother I am certain about ( Chsemepelia talpacoti),
but am not so sure about the father, which is either Ch. minuta or
passerina, I think the first. The first attempt was in March or April
and two young birds were hatched, but died in the nest or because
the nest fell to pieces under them ; next time the mother chose a half
coco-nut to lay in and hatched two young, both of which left the
nest, but one died almost at once. The other survived and is still
alive, a fine bird larger than its mother and with as blue or bluer a
head. The parents then apparently went into heavy moult, but in
spite of this, went to nest and unexpectedly produced another young
bird, which flew on 18th July and is still alive.
The second cross is " Cinnamon Dove " (= talpacoti) X " Black-
winged Andean Dove " bred by Mr. Berry in Guernsey this summer
and recorded in Bird Fancy , 31st July, 1937. One young hybrid reared
by a Senegal Dove ; the parents had hatched young in former years
but would not rear them. " Cinnamon Dove " is another name for

BREEDING PARTICULARS OF THE
YELLOW-BILLED MAGPIE

The Yellow-billed Magpie of California is a peculiar bird. Ik
resembles all other Magpies, except for its bright light yellow bill,
also the eyelids and a patch behind the eye are yellow. It is smaller
than the English bird. Its distribution is a very restricted one, being,
found only in certain parts of the Sacramento and San Joaquim Valleys
in California, where green oaks grow. In these few spots, the bird is
quite common, and behaves just like our Magpies, being often seen,
near farms and houses. On account of its extraordinary localization,,
the species is awarded full protection. Like most North American
birds, it cannot be exported without special permission, and the five
specimens that Mr. Delacour brought over last February were the
first to reach Europe alive.
Mr. Delacour gave me a pair of these attractive birds, which he
had brought over from California. With luck they turned out to be a
pair, and I put them into one of my small aviaries, which they had to
themselves. A nest was built in a basket in the sleeping quarters of
the aviary. The basket was hung 9 feet from the floor, and the nest
was made of mud and dried grass. The basket was first lined with
mud, and this was covered with dry grass, so thinly that patches of the
mud could be seen through the grass. The first egg was laid on 18th
May. Seven eggs were laid in all by the 24th May. Colour of eggs

greyish-white ground, heavily speckled with pale brown uneven spots.
Five young were hatched out on the 10th June. One egg was infertile,
and the other contained a dead chick. Three of the young ones were
picked up dead on 13th June. The remaining two were fully reared,
leaving the nest on 3rd July. They started to eat a couple of days after
leaving the nest, and were no bother to rear. The young were reared
on stock food, raw meat, mice, earthworms, and mealworms. Colour
of the young is identical with the parents, with the exception of the
beak, which is white.

It will readily be conceded that the Mecca of all keepers and students
of birds in this country, whether members of our Society or not, is
Mr. Herbert Whitley's Zoo at Primley, Paignton.
More than this, everyone who wanted to study living animals,
fish, reptiles, and plants, to see complete series of them, to know how
to keep them in splendid condition, and how best to get them to
reproduce themselves went to Paignton to learn from this great
and practical naturalist. It was a pleasure which many hundreds of
people looked forward to year by year, and which was the subject
of grateful comment all over the country.
And now this Zoo is closed to members of the Avicultural Society
and to the Public. And why ? Mr. Whitley naturally had to make
a charge for admission to help pay the extra expenses involved in
controlling the Public and in providing and keeping up spaces for them,
but he definitely refused to allow the Public to be mulcted by the
payment of entertainment tax for what he claimed was not an enter-
tainment but an educational opportunity.
The local bench of Magistrates have twice declared the Zoo to be an
entertainment, and Mr. Whitley has suffered the indignity of being
fined substantial sums in the police court.

The office of Customs and Excise have also demanded the retrospec-
tive payment of tax for a considerable period.
It is pertinent to ask whether a bench of magistrates who may not
themselves be naturalists is capable of deciding what is educational
in the realm of natural history, and how people at the offices of Customs
and Excise who have not seen the collection themselves or sent natural
history experts to view it on their behalf should know it to be an enter-
tainment suitable to be taxed.
Surely such a case as this should be judged on its merits, and a law
which does not recognize this is a bad and silly law and should be
amended. If Mr. Whitley had formed his Zoo into a society, or resorted
to other subterfuges to circumvent the law, payment of the tax by the
Public might have been avoided, but this he absolutely refused to do,
maintaining that his collection was no less educational or more enter-
taining if ran by himself instead of by a society. As to making a profit
out of it it is known that Mr. Whitley subsidizes it by many thousands
of pounds a year out of his own pocket, and also devotes every penny
paid by the Public in entrance fees to further extensions and fresh
series of living specimens.
Parenthetically it may be remarked that England is the only
country where Zoos are not subsidized by the state, so educational
in value are they considered to be.
As to its being an entertainment, no entertainment of any kind
is allowed ; there are no bands, games, elephant rides, or fixed feeding
times, and no creature is ever put where it can be seen by the Public
until it is in perfect condition and of definite educational value to those
who wish to learn. Why then is it more of an entertainment than
a Zoo run by a Society ? Will the office of Customs and Excise next
decide that agricultural shows, flower shows, museums, and any or
every kind of scientific gathering where entrance is charged is to be
taxed ? It behoves us as members of a scientific society and as members
of the General Public to see that they are not, and to agitate for the law
to be amended or to be applied in a sensible manner by knowledgeable
people. The Primley Zoo will only be re-opened if we lift up our voices
and continue to press the authorities till a tax, not on entertainment,
but on education, is removed.

By E. Valentine
I have hopes of the new Parrot-Finches bringing of! a nest of young,
I had seen very little of them, the hen not once for over a fortnight,,
until last Saturday when I saw them very busy at the live ants' eggs,
evidently flying to a nest I cannot find--of course I have not looked
seriously for one.
Since then I have seen them every day and I have some hopes of
success.
Some time since I picked up a dead Bedheaded Parrot-Finch three
parts feathered. That was in another aviary, the old birds are now on
with their second nest.
Ten days ago, on my return from the Test Match at Manchester,
I found four young Double-banded Finches flying about their aviary,
the same one that contains the Blue-headed Parrot-Finches. They are
still going strong, but I am watching them closely as the old folks-
seem to be looking for another nest.
The Cherry-Finches have done nothing yet, after spending much
time looking like business.
This morning I got a shock when I gathered a dead young bird,
again three parts feathered, which I was sure must be a precious Blue-
head, but on examining same I have come to the conclusion it is too
small for a Parrot-Finch and more like a Cuban, of which my pair are
in the same aviary.
To-day (6th August) four fine young Blue-headed Parrot-Finches
left their nest. Even yet I don't know where it is, but suspect they
were hatched in a Parrakeet nest-box.

Many bird lovers consider a beautiful song the most essential
point in choosing a softbill. I count myself among these, though
exquisite colouring and form are, perhaps, quite as important.
Looking back on the keeping of many softbills, pride of place must
be given for song to the Indian Shama--it is melodious and a really
good Shama never ceases to sing. I have had several varieties. First
the usual form from Bombay ; then the variety from Nepal, a lovely
creature of glorious form, next a very large, extra long-tailed kind from
Penang ; this one is still with me, and is certainly very fine. Some years
ago Mr. Goodfellow told me of this variety and said he had seen a
beauty in or near a native temple, so when I was offered my present
bird I did not hesitate to buy it. Unfortunately for me, it had been
brought over on the dried worms that come occasionally with Indian
softbills, and I found it difficult to get it on to our usual food ; but
although sick, this Shama still sang. It has since fully recovered and
is now a great joy. I have recently acquired Strickland's Shama, the
white-capped variety from Borneo, a very beautiful bird that I have
long wished to possess ; it has a typical song, quite soft at present,
but then it is not yet in fine form.
A few years ago I was fortunate enough to secure the Black-headed
Mocking Thrush from Brazil. In a cage he scarcely sang, but when
turned out into an outdoor aviary, the song was marvellous ; one would
wake up in the morning to the sound of his glorious notes, beautiful
yet strange and tropical.
Among Fruitsuckers I have had several that sang well but none so
good as one now in my possession, an all green one with a black mask
rejoicing in the grand name of the Malachite-shouldered Leaf Bird,
his picture appeared recently in this Magazine. Nearly every day
he invents something new, at times his whistle is so clear, that it is
difficult to believe it is a bird's--he is a wonderful mimic and imitates

a Shama, a Blackbird, and a Thrush, he can also copy other sounds
not always quite so good !
Many of the Sunbirds have lovely little voices and sing well. The
tiny Van Hasselt's Sunbird used particularly to delight me, and the
Yellow-breasted from the Philippine Islands is still here to charm with
his constant sweet song.
The King Bird of Paradise has a very pleasing chattering little song,
very delightful to listen to, the Rufous-bellied Niltava has a low sweet
song, and another Robin-like bird, the White-tailed Blue Robin Chat
from India, has a rather similar song, perhaps even more pleasing.
Very lovely and sweet like a peal of tiny bells is the song of the Loo-
Choo Robin, never loud, always well modulated ; this is, of course,
one of the most charming birds one can possess.
The Clarinos are noted for their song so flutelike and clear ; and in
the days of the late Mr. Chapman I had one with a glorious song. I
now have the Martinique Solitaire, a very pretty bird, grey and chest-
nut, with yellow legs and white on tail: this bird has a very lovely song,
long drawn out sweet notes, with a refrain in a minor key, and he sings
late in the evening and very early in the morning. A Whistling Thrush
I had sang like a musical box and was very good to listen to, especially
out of doors.
The Fairy Bluebird sings, but it is much too monotonous to be
considered good and it is too easy to mimic, as I knew to my cost when
my Grey Parrot chose to do the Fairy Bluebird from morn till night !
There must be many other softbills among foreign birds with outstand-
ing powers of song, and it would be very interesting to hear from readers
of their experiences with them.

My success in breeding Swifts last year for the first time in Britain
has, I am glad to say, been repeated this year on a larger scale.
I began the season with two adult breeding pairs and their three
last year's youngsters--two cocks and a hen.
Being somewhat short of aviary room I decided to try a venture
at " colony " breeding, my observation of the birds' temperament
leading me to suppose that there would be no serious quarrels--a
forecast which has been fully justified.
In one aviary I retained a single pair ; these duly went to nest and
reared two youngsters. One of these, some time after it had flown,
was either injured or overtaken by some mysterious malady, completely
losing the use of its wings. Later, to some extent, its legs became
affected also and it started to breathe badly like a bird with inflamma-
tion of the lungs. I gave up all hope of its recovery, but Swifts, unlike
some other members of the Parrot family (notably Yasas, New Zealands,
and young Plumheads), put up a tough fight against illness and when
I added bread and milk sweetened with honey to its diet of Allinson's
it began slowly to improve and it is now able to fly again and has almost
completely recovered. It is the first instance I have ever known of
any sick Parrakeet recovering once it has begun to breathe through
its beak.
The second aviary contained an adult cock and hen and two young
cocks and a young hen, for which I provided four nests.
Swift hens, like Budgerigar ladies, do not seem to be conspicuous
for their fidelity. The adult hen deserted her spouse of 1936 for a younger
admirer, while the old cock consoled himself with the young hen. The
" odd man out " did not make himself a nuisance, beyond feeding the
young lady when her husband's back was turned ! He was rather
an accomplished bird, having learned to imitate with surprising accuracy
the cries of the Ringnecks that formerly occupied an adjoining aviary--

an effort at mimicry even more unexpected than that of the Racket-
tailed Parrots who have learned to copy both the human speech and the
most inhuman yells of the Queen of Bavaria Conures ! My experience
with Swifts differs from M. Decoux's. Not only did my young hen breed
when a year &apos;old, but both young cocks also came into full breeding
condition rather in advance of the adults : not only so, but one of them
happens to be the parent of the best youngster--a lovely little cock
already showing some red spots on the breast and promising to grow
bigger and more richly coloured than any of the imported adults.
The two hen Swifts treated each other with becoming forbearance
and I never saw any sign of quarrelling. The older one selected a natural
tree trunk and the youngster a grandfather clock box and they reared
two and three young respectively. The cocks also did no serious fighting
beyond momentarily asserting their rights against an intruder who
attempted interference with his companion's mate or nest. In the main
the young cock was master but he was enough of a gentleman to give
way on occasions when he was obviously in the wrong.
Cock Swifts when in breeding condition behave rather differently
from other Parrakeets. On finding an alluring nest-hole they warble
excitedly and shiver their wings and later go inside and inspect the
premises, but should a hen wish to enter they at first drive her away
and only admit her some days later, with an apparent show of reluctance,
when they are quite sure her intentions are serious. It may be that they
know more about feminine psychology than cock Broadtails. A Broad-
tail, with much tail-waggling, entreats " Do come and look at this
perfectly wonderful home I've found " and usually gets the reply,
"-H 'm ; I don't think much of that. The entrance hole is far too big
and I'm sure it's simply full of snakes ! " On the other hand the cock
Swift announces My place is absolutely it. I've been inside and I know
all about it. Let you have a look at it 1 No fear ! At least not yet ;
I rather think Mary will be coming along soon and perhaps I shall
allow her a peep ! "
When courting the cock Swift gives a curtsey a little reminiscent
of one of the actions of a Barraband and then, drawing himself up,
finds the hen, after which he repeats the performance. Later, when she
is sitting, the curtsey is omitted before feeding takes place. The hen

alone incubates and both she and her mate are devoted and long-
suffering parents. The youngsters are lazy, selfish, and rather ungrateful
little beggars, expecting their tired and moulting parents to feed them
long after they are well able to look after themselves if they tried. Later,
when they do start to feed themselves, they drive their elders away
in the most irritable fashion should they desire some delicacy for their
own consumption. Baby Swifts, like young Bourkes and Budgerigars,
are beautiful little creatures when newly fledged, their immaculate
plumage being a soft replica of their parents' and their dark eyes being
prettier than the orange-brown of the adults. They are rarely stupidly
nervous and the young cock already referred to would feed from my
hand a few days after leaving the nest. My birds are kept in 24 ft. X
8 ft. X 8 ft. movable aviaries and fed on Dr. Allinson's food prepared
as for infants and sweetened, sweetened white bread and milk, apple,
green food, and mixed seed. At first I used to give only millet and canary
but this year I found that they readily ate hemp and sunflower as well
and appeared to benefit thereby.
Swifts stand by themselves in the Parrot family with some distant
affinity, I am sure, to the Polytetive Parrakeets and none whatever
to the Lorikeets. Gentle, interesting, beautiful, inoffensive in voice,
and easily tamed, they have but two drawbacks : like most nectar-
feeders they are very messy and their shelter requires constant cleansing.
They are also, I think, not completely hardy and some artificial heat
in winter is probably indispensable.
Although not exactly easy to sex, the hen Swift is sufficiently
duller than her mate to be fairly easily distinguished. Young birds
undergo a partial moult into brighter plumage when a few months old,
full adult dress being assumed the following autumn.

This gentle Dove, which with the proper treatment becomes quickly
tame in the aviary, I have now kept for a number of years mainly for
two reasons. In the first place, there is its plaintive " mourning " coo,
penetrating, vibrant, with the suggestion of far-off, lonely woods and
deep forests. It is the only call-note uttered by this species, the male,
to be correct, the female having no such note. Both sexes, however,
utter a whirring note of fear at the approach of strange animals or
people. Moreover, in sudden and fast flight, the Mourning Dove emits
a whistling wing-note, which you are not likely to forget once you have
heard it. My other reason for keeping a number of pairs of this lively
dove is that it has proved to be a very dependable foster parent for
the medium-sized species of foreign Doves which so frequently neglect
their offspring. Especially valuable is the Mourning Dove's trait of
staying near the youngsters just after they have left the nest and are
sitting in some obscure corner on the ground of the aviary, waiting
to be fed. As every Dove-fancier knows, this is the most critical
period in the life of young Doves, many dying of starvation because
their parents fail to seek them out when they are on the ground.
Mourning Doves are quite gentle, and therefore easy to handle---
a great advantage when they are to serve as foster parents. No matter
how closely I approach their nest, whichever bird is on the nest will
sit tight, so that I have to lift it off if I want to see the contents of
the nest. When the female is frightened off the nest, she usually drops
to the ground where she goes into a series of odd contortions as if her
wings were broken and she were unable to fly. Undoubtedly this
species of Dove is one of the most prolific. In point of fact, I have a pair
which at this writing is on its fifth setting of eggs, having successfully
reared four pairs of youngsters so far this season. Like other kinds of
Doves, the Mourning Dove will sit on or between its young even
though they are well feathered, and even though it is very hot.

It is a careless nest builder, and if not disturbed will use the same
nesting site throughout the season. Usually the succeeding clutch of
eggs is laid a day or two after the young have left the nest. Always
the squabs are sleek and well-fed. The old birds are very fond of
bread. Mealworms they will not touch. Their favourite seeds seem
to be millet and hemp, especially the latter. I have observed Mourning
Doves taking sun, but not water baths. They get along well with the
smaller species of foreign Doves, such as Cape and Diamond Doves.
Surplus specimens released from the aviary frequently return after a
few days. I always recognize them by their legbands. After they
have had food and drink, they fly ofl swiftly into the nearby hills, and
soon learn to shift for themselves.

members may like to obtain some of these birds through the medium
of our Society, should such be the case, you have only to join the
O.P.S. ; subscription is only 6s. per annum, and full particulars will
be sent to you. The showing of Pheasants was discussed, .and a com-
mittee of two was appointed to look into the whole question of suitable
pens for showing and transport. After the meeting we passed through
to the Gardens, where Monsieur Delacour and the Head Keeper kindly
showed us round the Pheasant enclosures. This was an education to
many of our members, and a pleasure to all of us.
Tea was then taken in the tea pavilion, and during this pleasant
interlude, it was proposed that Miss Knobel, your untiring Secretary,
should be elected an honorary member of the O.P.S. This proposition
was not even put to the vote, so heartily was it acclaimed. We all
felt that Miss Knobel had served the Avicultural Society in a most
worthy manner, and that it would therefore be an honour to our Society
if she consented to accede to our wish. Miss Knobel in a few charming
words expressed her appreciation of the kind thought that had prompted
this honour. So the afternoon had passed, and we all left feeling that
we had made a great step forward ; the Society was formed to encourage
the keeping and propagation of many rare Pheasants, and this meeting
by deciding to import these Pheasants has surely done something
really practical to justify its existence, and by this action, we hope,
made the O.P.S. worthy of support.

THE HANDBOOK OF BRITISH BIRDS
Madam, --As many ornithologists are already aware, a new edition of
A Practical Handbook of British Birds has been for some time in preparation.
We should be very grateful to any of your readers who would now send
us notes of any omissions or errors in the original work, and of any unpublished
observations which would make the work more accurate and complete. Should
secrecy in regard to locality be necessary this will be rigidly respected.

Since the " Handbook " was completed twelve years ago such a vast-
amount of matter relating to distribution, migration, breeding habits, and
food has been published both at home and abroad, that the revision made
necessary is a very heavy task involving the rewriting of most of these
sections.
Moreover field characters, habitat, song, and "habits" generally, to
which very -little space was devoted in the original work, will be greatly
expanded, and these new. sections are being undertaken by Mr. B. W. Tucker
(with Mr. Charles Oldham's kind approbation).
The new work will be very fully illustrated in colour, the aim being to
show all the birds in as far as possible all their plumages. Such a series of
illustrations is not now available to British ornithologists and it is hoped
that this new feature will greatly enhance the usefulness of the work, especially
to observers in the field.
The original " Practical Handbook " will be in fact so much a new work
that we consider an alteration of the title to The Handbook of British Birds
justified.
As it is proposed to publish in five volumes at six monthly intervals,
beginning next spring, we shall be glad to have now any notes relating to
the Order Passeres. It would be a convenience if observations concerning
breeding habits or food were sent direct to the Rev. F. C. R. Jourdain at
Bellevue Road, Southborne, and all other notes to me at Gracious Pond Farm,.

NESTING OF LAZULI BUNTINGS

<bodyText confidence="0.998290333333334" page_id="56322155"  page_num="269" year="" vol="">
Madam,-- Although it is already a tale of failure, I think it may be of
interest to record that my pair of Lazuli Buntings have nested. Three eggs
were laid, and the hen sat very steadily ; the first was hatched on 25th July,
when I think the hen had been sitting for ten days, and the second on the
eleventh or twelfth day. Unfortunately I found one young one lying dead
in the shelter (at the opposite end of the flight to where the nest is) on the
third day after hatching. I had to go away from home and am still away,
but I had a letter saying that the second chick was found dead, also in the
shelter, on the eighth or ninth day after hatching, so it must have lived about
a week. As far as we know, the third egg did not hatch. I wrote to the
maid who is responsible for the birds while I am away, and told her to remove
the third egg carefully if she got the chance, but when she went to do so
she found two eggs, and could not tell which was the old one (if it was still
there), so wisely left them alone, and the hen is now sitting again on three
eggs. I hope to be at home before the next lot hatch (if they do), but fear the
same disappointment. As live ants eggs, etc., were plentifully supplied for
the first family, 1 can think of nothing further to do.
The nest was rather coarsely but neatly woven in an open wire basket,
with a tin roof hung high up at the end of the flight (where we are continually
passing by), and by climbing on a chair one could see plainly into the nest,
which was close to the wire. Needless to say, as soon as the young were =

hatched all unnecessary coming and going by that way was stopped, and
the bird left quite undisturbed.
I I have had these birds for over a year, and won several prizes with
them at shows last season (incidentally my first show season), including

THE OCELLATED TURKEY
(Meleagris ocellata )
By David Seth-Smith
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.99788935" page_id="56322163"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
Now that the Game birds have become very popular with avicul-
turists, it may not be out of place to publish two photographs, taken
more than twenty years ago, of one of the most beautiful species of all,
the Ocellated Turkey which, alas, is now one of the rarest and least
known of them all.
Unfortunately photographs can convey little idea of the beauty of
coloration of this wonderful species though, with a little imagination,
they may help. It is difficult to describe the colours of this bird, as
they change as one views them at different angles, but the general
effect is a greenish-bronze with purer metallic green on the smaller
wing-coverts. The tail feathers and their coverts terminate in large
ocelli of brilliant greenish-blue with broad margins of reddish copper.
The naked skin of the head is blue with a band of red round the eye,
and near the eyes and on the forehead are a number of wart-like
processes of a brilliant orange colour.
This remarkable Turkey inhabits Central America, Guatemala,
Yucatan, and British Honduras, but is nowhere common, and no
serious attempts have been made to domesticate it. Indeed, the few
published accounts imply that it is quite unsuited to a life in captivity,
and lives but a few months after capture even in its own country.

D. Seth-Smith--The Ocellated Turkey
The late Mr. W. K. Pomeroy spent some time in British Honduras
searching for this species with a view to importing specimens to
Europe. He managed, after a great deal of trouble, to shoot two
specimens for a museum, and later discovered a pair in captivity in
Cayo, which he was able to purchase ; but, in spite of great care, they
died very soon after he acquired them. He wrote : " There is something
extraordinary about these birds ; they become quite tame in captivity,
yet never live more than a few months." He mentions that a clutch
of eggs, placed under a domestic hen, produced chicks which thrived
well so long as the foster-mother looked after them, but when left to
care for themselves, refused food, and died. But this experience is not
universal.
There is no doubt that the Ocellated Turkey is better adapted to
a warm climate than to one such as that of the British Isles, but, in
spite of this, examples kept in the London Zoological Gardens have
done fairly well ; I have known eight in all during the last twenty-eight
years, only one of which died within the year, most of the others living
for three years or over, and one for ten years when it met with an
accident.
A pair which arrived in the spring of 1912 were in breeding condition
in May, 1914, when the cock-bird became very aggressive, attacking
his keeper when he entered the aviary ; and during a spell of hot
weather showed off his display for the first time. This was very
similar to that of the common Turkey, but the much greater brilliance
of his plumage and the blue skin on the face gave the Ocellated Turkey
a different and more magnificent appearance. The skin became more
intense blue, and the orange warts showed to great perfection on the
triangular fleshy knob which appeared between the eyes.
During display the bird uttered a peculiar booming note, quite
unlike that of the common Turkey, though from time to time he would
extend his neck and give utterance to a " gobble " somewhat similar
to that of the common bird.
So far as I can remember, eggs were laid which proved infertile,
a result, doubtless, of the low temperature compared with that of the
bird's native habitat. It was noticeable that only in really hot weather
did the pair assume their full vigour.

A brief account of one or two happenings during 1936-7 may be
of some interest to others, so I forward them.
Barnard's Parakeet (Barnardius barnardius), our old hen--we have
had her fourteen years--went to nest with her second husband (her
first having died two years before) in 1936, and brought up a family
of three fine youngsters. She had laid two clutches, but the first got
caught in a cold spell, and did not hatch, so she laid a second. On the
day she began to sit, fortunately a Sunday, when I was at home to see,
some hundreds of wild bees (species unknown) were flying about the
aviaries and entering Parrakeet nest boxes, and of course concentrated
on the Barnards' box, so that she came off. Doing what I could to
save the situation, I raised my hands for the Barnards' to go into the
shelter--they are very tame and went in with no fuss--and closed the
shelter trap, emptied the Barnard nest of some ten or twelve bees
already in it, and plugged the entrance hole with a handkerchief, and
then set out on the four or five Parrakeet nests, round which there were
still many bees, saucers containing some honey and rum, hoping the
bees would be diverted by this counter-attraction, and leave the
Barnards' nest alone if not the others. A folded towel was used to
" swat " many on the outside of the Barnards' nest. The rum and
honey accounted for many, and hard work with the towel cleared the
neighbourhood of the Barnards' nest, so that after an hour and a half
I opened the trap, and Mrs. B. went straight back on to her nest, as
if nothing had happened. Some of the bees hung around for the next
two or three days, but they were then concentrating on a Manycolours
in the next aviary, which had a saucer of the honey mixture on top
of it, and, as no nesting was going on there, it didn't matter, and things
went on all right afterwards as far as the Barnards w&apos;ere concerned.
This sort of bee has in previous years nested in a hole in a nearby oak
tree, some 15 feet from the ground.
Mrs. Barnard's second husband is a large and very handsome
imported bird, and had been in England for some years before he
came into my possession, probably before the ban, and, like a good

Evelyn Strawson--1936 and 1937
many humans at the present time, evidently has ideas on dietetics.
When young were due to hatch we usually put out soaked wheat, oats,
hemp, etc., in separate dishes for the parents to choose and eat what
they will to feed their young, in addition, of course, to green stuff.
With her former husband the young were brought up almost entirely
on soaked hemp and some wheat; not so from now on, hemp and
wheat were untouched, and oats was almost the only seed used.
This Coronation year, Mrs. B. thought, I suppose, that it was
up to her to rise to the occasion, and laid a clutch of five eggs. We
hoped she was going to repeat her 1932 performance, when she laid
five and reared five, unfortunately it was a bitterly cold day when
she laid her last, and though she had begun to sit, she was off the nest
nearly the whole day--the first time we have ever known her have
any trouble laying ; however, she laid it and, the others I suppose
being chilled, only one (presumably the last) hatched, so that the
parents were able to concentrate all their dietetic knowledge on the
rearing of this one, and reared the largest young Barnard we have yet
seen. A hen they reared last year is now rather larger than her mother,
and I shall watch with interest the later growth of this young 1937 cock.
Rose Breasted Grosbeaks (Zamelodia ludoviciani). ---This pair, the
hen of which was bred here, had a nest of three last year in a rather
exposed place. They were doing splendidly till about eight days old, and
growing apace, when a violent storm one night evidently drove the hen
off, and the next morning the young were dead and the hen half-drowned,
and somewhat damaged. This year, just as they were about to nest, a
visitation from a Tawny Owl caused damage to both birds, and stopped
all their nesting activities.
Lady Amherst Pheasants ( Chrysolophus amherstive). --The several
cocks of this species that have tried have behaved in a perfectly beastly
manner with their wives ; give them as many wives as you or they will,
and provide them with ample space, and thick-growing bushes as
hides, the cock seems to come into condition before the hens are ready
to lay, and harry, mutilate, or even kill his hens. I think it is the
fault of confinement, as in nature no doubt the hens only approach
the male at the breeding season when ready to be paired with, and
then clear off out of his sight. Certainly it is a far more difficult bird

than its near relative, the Golden, which we bred over several years in
the past, and which is nothing like so murderous. However, all the
eggs we had were fertile, and several were reared. This year we tried
keeping the cock Amherst in an adjacent aviary with only a wire
partition having a door in it separating him from the hens, so that he
could see them and display to them, and letting in each hen as she
started laying ; even so, he severely damaged one, and nearly massacred
another. However, in spite of the mess of wounds, blood, and feathers
he made of the second hen, she has recovered, and is now nearing
perfection as her moult progresses. Truly Kipling's dictum concerning
" the female of the species " is not true of Amhersts. Perhaps all
cock Amhersts do not behave in so murderous a manner. I should be
interested to hear.
Satyr Tragopans (Tragopan satyra ).--With a young male we had
bred ourselves three years before and an imported hen we (last year)
had five eggs only, four hatched, though one had to be helped out and--
as always happens in these circumstances--died. The other three did
excellently till some six or seven weeks old, when at a very wet period
they got " gapes ", which I am ashamed to say I did not recognize
till too late, and we lost them. Unfortunately we lost the adult cock
in the autumn and, as we could only get an immature (1936) male, we
have only had infertile eggs this year. We had not experienced
" gapes " before--I may say I do not think the complaint is well
named, the birds coughed or sneezed (as also with some bantam chicks
at the same time), and it was only when I did a post mortem on one,
and found the Syngamus trachealis, that I realized what it was. We
then tried our President's treatment, and it acts extremely well, though
not in the quick manner in which it acted on his Starling, but taking
several days and several doses, in isolation, of course.
Just a note about the Tragopan's display. It is certainly not all
done as display to the hen. I have many times seen the male at the
breeding season, when a Blackbird or Sparrow (I have seen him do it
to both) has flown down near one end of his enclosure, run the whole
length of his enclosure--about 12 yards--and do a display before
them, presumably with the idea of frightening them off, but they took
no notice. The display included the erection of the horns and the

letting down of the gular skin (bib), but not, in so far as I remember,
the quivering of the wings.
A Rainbow Bunting (? Cyanospiza leclancheri) hen, which we have
had for several years, last year laid three eggs in a round tin with
canary seed in it. We had seen her flying round with bits of grass, etc.
However, she made no nest whatever, but laid on the bare seed. Though
there was a male Bunting there, he had not long been purchased, and
was certainly not in breeding condition. However, the thin shelled
eggs inevitably got broken--probably by other birds--in spite of every
care, but the hen continued to sit for about a fortnight, and did not
leave her " nest " when we walked within a foot or so of it.
We then turned both cock and hen into the adjacent aviary, which
happened to be empty, and I fixed up all sorts of nesting contrivances.
I had read somewhere (a book in the bird room at South Kensington
Museum, I think) that they nested in heaps of stones, so heaps of
stones, tins filled with dry sand, etc., were fixed up, but she would
have none of them, but again sat--this time without laying--in the
tin of canary seed. This year she sat without laying in the canary seed
tin again. The eggs are extremely elongated, white (looking pinkish
from the yolk showing through), with dull red or purplish spots at
and around the larger end, reminding one of the English Swallow's egg.
I do not remember hearing of this bird's laying in England before.
Chinese Hawfinches (. Euphonia migratoria). --This pair we had had
quite six years, and most years they have nested and hatched, but we
cannot rear the young above eight or nine days. They nested again
last year, four eggs and four hatched, and experimentally we removed
the male bird when the young were about seven days old, but we did
not rear them : mealworms do not seem sufficient as a live food.
Remembering Canon Farrar's account of using cockroaches, we tried
to get some, but apparently the sanitary authorities of this district
have eliminated them or modern houses are not favourable to their
habitation and increase, anyway they were not forthcoming. So we
were unable to try them. We lost the cock bird in the autumn, and
have not replaced him. They need an aviary to themselves when
nesting.

two young Stanley Parrakeets (Psephotus icterotis), which had been
badly picked in the nest, and so were poorly feathered, indeed some
of the feather tracts appeared to be absent or destroyed, and to a
certain extent they were feather pickers themselves. The vendor
thought they would never breed and, though they might improve,
would never be perfect.
This latter is so far true of the cock ; he is not a feather plucker and,
except for a small patch on each shoulder which annually appears to
get less, is quite a passable though not a show specimen ; we have
not yet tried to breed from him. The hen, however, if she were not a
feather-plucker, would be a better bird than the cock, but unless she
is occasionally given meat or fat she featherplucks till she looks a
dreadful ragamuffin. This year, she was paired to a normal cock, and
had brought up two perfect babies. When these were about three weeks
old she began to pluck their rump feathers, so we again gave her a
bone with some meat and fat on it, and she ceased plucking, and they
rapidly grew new feathers from where she had removed them, so that
now, at about three months old, and still unseparated from their
parents, they are pictures of perfection. In this isolated case the
condition appears to be an individual one, possibly initiated by some
deficiency in the diet which may have been of a temporary nature.
I think Stanley's eat more apple for their size than any other Parrakeet
I have kept. Throughout their upbringing we never saw the cock
Stanley feed the young, neither did they appeal to him for food.

dark rosy red. It was a good number of years ago that I got my first
specimens, which I found being unpacked after their voyage from
Brazil in Chapman's shop one Christmas morning. This pair built
a large nest in a bush, as recorded by Mr. Shore Baily in Aviculture,
vol. iii, but unfortunately one of the pair died.
After some years I bought six more from two fellow members, and
turned them all into one aviary for lack of space. Every summer
they built a large spherical nest with the entrance at the side, and
about 5 feet from the ground. All the Crakes used to spend the
day sitting together in the nest, and any eggs that were laid were
doubtless smashed. Gradually the birds were reduced by death to
two, which we thought were a pair, but any expectation of their
breeding had long been given up.
However, on the 7th August of this year, my aviary attendant saw
what she thought was a black mouse scuttling across the sanded floor,
and on watching carefully found it to be a baby Crake. We have no
idea how many eggs were laid, or what was the period of incubation.
The baby, which was covered with black down, was fed by its parents
on greenfly, which were present in quantities on some hops growing
in the aviary, and we supplemented these with a few small mealworms
and chopped earth worms. At the beginning of September the young
bird was fully grown, and brown like its parents, only a trace of black
remaining on its face. It can now be seen bathing in the pool and
feeding from the dish of insectivorous food.
The aviary the Crakes are in has a brick shed for shelter, moderately
warmed in the winter, and a long flight backed by a brick wall. It is
thickly planted with shrubs at the back, but has a clear sanded space
in front, with a small post in the middle.
I find a thickly sanded floor to be best for all ground birds. Concrete
or gravel are apt to give them corns, and grass is difficult to keep
in order. We spread a good thick layer of ashes to provide sharp
drainage, and then lay 6 inches or more of washed sand over the
ashes. This is raked over two or three times a week, and keeps in good
condition.
I believe this is the first occasion on which the Cayenne Crake has
been bred in this country.

(Turdus elgonensis)
By W. B. Partridge
This pair of breeding Jackson's Thrushes was imported from
Kenya about May last year, along with two other Jackson's and some
other birds, by a friend. I secured all four, and at the time it was
almost impossible to sex them. Their colours were identical, the
only guide being that two were slightly smaller and more feminine
in general appearance, suggesting hens. This has since proved to be
correct, and now the cock bird is definitely slightly larger than the
hen, while the only noticeable difference in colouring is that the cock
has a larger area of white on the abdomen.
When the birds arrived I put them together in an aviary, where
they stayed until the end of August. I then sold one pair to Colonel
Appleby, who later exhibited them with some success at the last
Crystal Palace Show.
I gave the other two, for I thought them a true pair, an aviary to
themselves, not moving them after this, and it was here they bred.
This aviary is really a row forming a range with a back feeding
passage. Each compartment is 6 by 4 feet, and has a 6 in.
ledge running right along one side, 6 feet from the floor. The flight
to each of these compartments is 4 feet wide and 11 feet long,
with no bushes or other natural furnishings.
By the middle of May this year; I was becoming very doubtful
about the supposed and hoped-for pair. They were never seen to feed
each other, and if one bird flew into the flight, the other immediately
retreated into the shelter, and this has been their behaviour all through
the winter months.
However, in the third week of May, one of the birds was seen carrying
bits of grass about. An ordinary small margarine box was placed, with
a strip of wood 3 inches high nailed across the front, on edge on
the 6 in. ledge. Building material supplied, the pair at once began
to build.

280 W. R. Partridge--Breeding of the Jackson's Thrush
The nest was a somewhat rough affair, composed of haystraw and
bits of stick, but this can perhaps be explained by the fact that the
hen must have gone immediately to nest, laying three eggs, one proving
to be infertile, for on the 2nd June two youngsters were hatched.
On the 18th the first youngster left the nest, and the second on the
20th, but on the between day, to be exact the 19th, two more eggs
were discovered under the second babe. One of these eggs hatched
and the youngster left the nest on 22nd July. Again, on 19th July,
three more eggs were there under this last youngster, but as the hen
was found to be egg-bound on this day, she was removed and put in
a heated cage until the egg causing the trouble had been laid, after-
wards she made a complete recovery. The eggs were removed from
the nest, and no attempt made to get them hatched.
Both parents fed the young with the cock particularly attentive,
feeding the babes that had left the nest, and taking food up for the
hen to feed the youngster in the nest.
The food they were reared on was earthworms--a decided
favourite--mealworms, and gentles.
All three youngsters are strong and healthy, and are now being fed
on ordinary insectivorous food, with only a small amount of live food
daily, and are entirely fending for themselves.
The colourings of the young birds is very similar to the young
Blackbird in its immature plumage. The head and back are best
described as nigger brown ; throat and upper breast, buffish-brown,
speckled with nigger brown ; lower breast, cream shading to white
on the abdomen ; flanks, rich rufus brown flecked with dark brown ;
under tail feathers, nigger brown shading to white on the tips ; wings
and tail, dark olive brown giving an olive-green sheen ; bill, dark horn ;
legs, white.
The eggs are greenish-blue, heavily mottled with nigger brown ;
the top of the egg being completely covered with this colour, and the
base very slightly. Shape and size similar to that of a Blackbird.

J. Cassidy--The Extinct Moa and the Living Kiwi 281
A CHAT ABOUT THE
EXTINCT MOA AND THE LIVING KIWI
By James Cassidy
44 Will you tell me something about the Kiwi and its habits ? "
I asked of the patient Naturalist working away in the Park
and Museum of New Plymouth on the West Coast of beautiful New
Zealand.
44 The Kiwi presents one of the greatest problems known to ornitho-
</figure>

logists. It is the only living representative of the Great Moa. Owing to
its diminutive size compared with that of the Moa it took to a life in the
bush and a result of this is that it has become 4 apterous that is to
say it has lost the use of its wings. The dense bush protected it from
enemies and gave it abundance of food, and so its wings fell into desuetude
It has a very long bill, probably evolved by its methods of procuring
food, by probing deep in the earth for worms, as well as in the decayed
prostrate logs of the bush, to obtain grubs and insects, on which
it largely subsists. Its rudimentary wings are about 2 inches in
length and quite hidden under the feathers ; they are useless for flying
or for defence. Its only means of offence and defence is by kicking. The
legs are powerfully developed. One evening I put two Domestic Fowls
with two Kiwis. When the Kiwis came out in the evening (they are
birds of strictly nocturnal habit) it was remarkably interesting to watch
them. The Cockerels in the yard, when they saw the long bill of the
Kiwi coming out, became very uneasy, and strutted to and fro, uttering
remonstrances of surprise and disgust. When this had gone on for some
time the bigger Kiwi of the two objected and made a rush for one of
the most abusive of the Cockerels, striking powerfully with its feet, so
that I had to go in and rescue the Cockerel.
" The Kiwi is almost blind and has very small eyes and extremely
short sight. It possesses a sharp, and even acute, sense of smell and
there is a delicate sensibility in its beak. The nostrils are situated
beneath the tip of the beak, enabling it to find its food both on the sur-
face and beneath.

to lay eggs. I had a very fine, handsome female Kiwi. She was fastidious
about a mate and it is a fact that the first intended mate that I introduced
to her she almost killed, so strongly did she disapprove of him. Perhaps
his scent displeased her. The second introduction was almost as un-
satisfactory at the beginning, as she punished him by giving him a
thorough thrashing. However, after the thrashing, the two became
reconciled and they mated. They had been mated three months when
she laid two eggs. One was laid a week after the other. Before laying
the eggs the pair dug a pit in the floor of the clay house. The pit was so
dug that the cavity was of dome shape, that shape giving the greatest
ease to the setting birds. Or perhaps I should say bird, as it is the male
bird that sets as, in a nest shaped in this way, he finds it possible to move
his body and turn to any position he will on the eggs.
" The eggs are buried for one third of their depth in the soil at the
bottom of the nest and for the most of the time the male bird sets across
them. Pie is much smaller than the hen bird. He sat twenty-eight days
and brought out one chick, and on the following day another--little
pure white fluffy creatures with pinkish bills.
" I procured earth worms for them, and grubs, and they were no
sooner hatched than they began to run about. The male bird, after his
long inactivity, was miserably emaciated and ate enormous quantities
of food. When the eggs were hatched the mother-bird at once took
possession of the chicks and reared them to maturity. I have seen the
chicks sitting close against her but not actually gathered under her. I
have also seen the mother-bird prod for worms, which she dropped
on the surface for the young ones.
" When one of the Kiwi chicks was half-grown I wanted to show it to
a friend and on going to the house to fetch it I found that it was dead,
its jugular vein having been severed by a weasel!
" I reared the other Kiwi ; he's running about in the park now.
It takes half a pound of fresh meat a day to feed a Kiwi, to save the cost
I freed him. When I was rearing the young ones I used to go into their
place, taking with me a dim light, and sit and watch them for an hour
or so, observing their habits. I have sat down on a seat only slightly
raised from the ground, without moving in the least and with my knee
at a slight angle, and the birds have come and prodded me over and

mounted on to me. As they prod they utter a sniff--a loud sniff. One
factor which contributes to the ease with which they find their way in
the darkness is the number of long black hairs disposed around the beak.
These hairs act as feelers and enable their owners to gauge the nearness
of surrounding objects.
" It required five months for the one remaining Kiwi to arrive at its
full growth. It lost its white covering--its chickhood--in about ten
weeks and then it became covered with hairy feathers of a soft browny
black."
"You mentioned that the Kiwi is related to the Moa."
" Yes, there is a large number of species of Moa ; the Kiwi is the
most diminutive form. The Moas range from the Kiwi through a large
number of species up to 14 feet high. The Moas attained their
highest development in the Pleistocene Age. From that period they
began to diminish in number though extremely slowly through the
Miocene and Pliocene Ages, up to the Quaternary, which last is the Age
of Man. Opinion varies amongst scientists as to what led to the extinc-
tion of the Moa. New facts are forthcoming daily proving that the Moa
lived within the last 250 years. It flourished in the Albury district
contemporaneously with the Maoris. Sir Walter Buffer sent me to explore
the Albury district for Moa bones. At that time ploughmen under
contract were ploughing the downs on the estate. Every day they turned
up quantities of moa bones. Some of the skeletons were more or less
perfect; other lots were only portions of a skeleton, as parts of the birds
had been removed. This was probably due to the Moa hunters. I was
able to make a large and valuable collection of mixed bones for
Sir Walter Buffer. Some of them were afterwards submitted to
Sir Bichard Owen. Amongst the numerous bones was one which he
thought was a new species and he would have named it after
Sir Walter Buffer, but the remaining portions of the skeleton were
not amongst those submitted. There were among the bones that I
collected six or seven distinct species, including some of those of the
Elephant-footed Moa, a species of massive structure."
" How do you account for the bones of the Moa being found in so
many places and so wide apart ? "
" Quite simply. Heavy birds would wade into the swamps and perish

in large numbers. Then floods coming--there was ten times the amount
of rain we have now--would carry away the dead Moas and deposit
their bodies in all parts. For example they occurred in vast numbers in
Glenmark swamp and in the swamps near Oamaru. The country around
Glenmark and Oamaru, where the greatest deposits of bones occurred,
is almost identical in general configuration. The largest deposits have
occurred in limestone districts. It is important in this connection to note
these matters. Glenmark, Oamaru, and Albury are limestone districts.
During the summer months some of the birds would stray high up into
the mountains feeding, where I have no doubt they were, at times, over-
taken by snow-storms and perished, owing to their being unable to
descend to the lower country. The shepherds have often discovered their
bodies on the mountain sides. Throughout the long Tertiary period
there was a greater humidity of atmosphere, and the general vegetation
was extremely rank, and on this rich vegetation the Moa, of course,
subsisted. When collecting the Moa bones we carefully forked deeply
around the place and we always found quantities of gizard stones, some
of them 2 inches in length, rounded and smooth and thoroughly
polished. These stones from the gizard were left in little heaps just where
the skeleton was turned up. When the ploughmen were ploughing the
new ground, near the Tengawa Gorge, on the Albury Estate, they turned
up some of the Maori ovens, and all around there we were able to collect
quantities of Moa bones. We also collected a number of Maori axes and
adzes, some of greenstone ; bone needles, made of Moa and Maori
bones. The latter are now in the Buller Collection in the Colonial
Museum, In the Albury district there is a considerable number of lime-
stone caves in which the Moa hunter dwelt for ages. The walls of the
caves are covered with grotesque figures and rock paintings, including
figures of Moa, eggs, Taniwhas, etc., and numerous other illustrations
of life in that period. I have an idea that these hunters farmed some
species of Moa ; cf course the Moa-farmer would be careful to select
the species with reference to the number of eggs and to the meat for use
as a ' table bird ' . . . " But space is filled ; the story of Moa romance
and so much else must, for the time being, end here and now.

These garrulous favourites always are popular with the public
which throngs about their cages intrigued by their lively curiosity
and engaging volubility. The bewildering range of colour may be said
to be black and white and every known shade in between.
The Parrot House of the Brookfield Zoo is a popular one--the
range of cages on three walls housing a fine and varied collection.
In summer they are all transferred to the commodious aviaries on
the west and south walls of the building and these outdoor cages
are protected from the sun by stately elms. While various species
have laid in these " community " cages there has been no successful
raising of young and until we can get our contemplated breeding
runs there is not likely to be any.
Entering we find in the first cage two pairs of the Bed-sided Eclectus
--these are beautiful birds and it is merely a matter of opinion as to
which is the handsomer--the male in brilliant green and scarlet or
the female in purple and crimson. A Muller's Parrakeet and Blue-
crowned Parrakeet share these quarters also.
Cage No. 2. Several fine Slender-bill Cockatoos--some of which
offer a start at friendliness with a pleasant " Hello-cockie ". This
is the extent of the conversation, however, and the visitor soon passes
on to
Cage No. 3. This houses a group of Bare-eyed Cockatoos--what
these lack in the power of speech is more than made up in activity.
One in particular is a feathered clown--dancing and bobbing up and
down--then suddenly runs to the back of the cage, coyly hides his
head under a pan and rolls it to the front. He mounts this circular
stage and starts a slow whirl--gradually turning faster and faster
until one would think he would topple over from dizziness---but he
suddenly stops of his own accord and walks sedately away.

Cage No. 4. In this cage we see four fine Leadbeater's Cockatoos
--these and the delicately tinted Salmon-crested Cockatoo are the
loveliest of this branch of the Parrot family. Their pink and white
plumage surmounted by the flamboyant crest are fit examples of
delicate pastel tinting.
Cage No. 5. A large group of Eoseate Cockatoos. To my mind
these are the least attractive of this family but there are many, I know,
who think the combination of ashy-grey and raspberry-pink super-
lative.
Cage No. 6. A fine pair of Keas. These never have become tame,
I regret to say, though I have heard of some examples which were
charmingly so. We have the legend of their bloodthirsty habits
posted above the cage but also qualify it with the statement that
probably 50 per cent of the public do not believe it.
Cages 7 and 8. Several fine Amazons. Fine in appearance but
some, unfortunately, have devilish dispositions. The keepers always
heave a sigh of relief when cleaning their cages is over. We have
several Double-yellow Heads, Green-cheeked, Yellow-naped, Yellow-
cheeked, Cuban, and Panama.
Cage No. 9. A pair of Illiger's Macaws, a Severe Macaw, and two
Conures, Mexican and White-eyed.
Cage No. 10. Two beautiful Grey Parrots. These are new arrivals
and we have not become acquainted as yet, but from what I have
read of these charming birds our friendship should be warm. They
are in perfect plumage--all the more remarkable since they came
direct from Africa.
Cage No. 11 is very large across one end of the room and displays
Macaws, Eed and Yellow, Blue and Yellow, and Military ; Cockatoos,
Sulphur-crested, Bare-eyed, Slender-billed, and Eoseate.
Cages 12 and 13. A dozen of the gorgeous Swainson's Lorikeets
use this double cage and contribute to the surfeit of rainbow hues.
A pair laid eggs in the hollow log provided but the female had no
inclination to incubate.

inmates here--the male especially is very tame and enjoys frollicking
about. These are unusually coloured birds--glossy, purplish-black

with the under surface of the tail old gold washed with red. They,
too, have attempted incubation on two eggs laid on the bare sand.
Thinking the installation of a log after the eggs were laid useless,
we introduced a cushion of sod and peat moss and lifted the eggs with
a spoon on to it. The female immediately went to the eggs and covered
them but was very careless about it--sometimes one egg was quite
exposed and she was very erratic. The eggs were found to be clear
eventually.
Cage No. 15. A beautiful pair of Pileated Parrakeets. These have
a colour scheme reminiscent of the Swainson's Lorikeet though of
different arrangement. In summer we have them with these birds
and all appear congenial.
Cage No. 16. An odd group. Two Javan Parrakeets, two Black-
headed Caiques, also very tame and playful, a tame Blue-headed
Parrot, a Lesser Vasa, and a Barnard's Parrakeet.
Cage No. 17. Another odd group. A second Blue-headed Parrot,
several Barnard's, and two of the rare Derbyan Parrakeets.
Cage No. 18. A pair of Crimson-winged Parrakeets which I think
are among the most brilliant and unusually coloured in this great
family, a pair of King's, also dazzlingly beautiful, a Port Lincoln,
and a Barraband. If I do not enthuse over all it is because of repetition
---all of them are attractive--some which may appear comparatively
dull make up in intelligence and lovable ways.
Cages 19 and 20. A double cage of Kosellas--Crimson, Common,
Pale-headed, and Yellow-bellied. Their gorgeous colours, even though
not exactly tasteful, to my way of thinking, do add much life and
variety.
Cage No. 21. Parrotlets, Turquoise-rumped and Blue-winged,
Tovies, Hooded Parrakeets, and several Bourke's Parrakeets. These
certainly are different in their soft colouring of pink, grey, and brown.
A pair of the Bourke's started an endless period of incubation but
after six weeks we found nothing hatched so removed the two eggs
from the log.
Cage No. 22. A pair of the very rare, nowadays, Turquoisines,
two male Stanley Kosellas, a female Red Rump, and three Blue-wings,
dainty and elegant in form and plumage.

288 K. Plath--Birds at the New Chicago Zoological Park
Cage No. 23. Many Budgerigars in all colours. These pretty little
birds attract much attention and the public insists on calling them
Lovebirds. We have not the latest developments in colour-breeding
these tiny Parrakeets, but have various shades of green, blue, and
yellow.
In corners of the building surmounting a planting of rubber trees
and palms rise decorative hawthorn branches, gnarled and rugged.
These show off to beautiful advantage some gorgeous Macaws. On
one we see a magnificent Hyacinthine and a Lear's and on the other
a beautiful Military Macaw and his " girl-friend ", a splendid Bed
and Yellow. We call them " Bobby " and " Bebe " but Bobby often
descends to perambulate along the rail which means isolation for
awhile.
This completes the list of our Parrot-like birds in their special
building. We have a fine White-crested Cockatoo which was intro-
duced to the Flying-cage of the Aquatic House prior to my arrival.
It probably will stay there as it is quite at home feeding on the grain
and greens furnished for the ducks and geese. On more than one
occasion I have seen it placidly nibbling on a smelt which it held
daintily in one foot. I have a great affection for this family of engaging
curiosity and only wish that I had more time for them. I still have
my lovely Spix Macaw at home (he summers at the Zoo) ; unfortunately
he is prone to nibbling his plumage and keeps an unsightly rough
patch on his " shoulders " and breast--an irritating habit to say the
least.
Probably by the time this article reaches the reader newer specimens
will have been added. One of the pleasures of this work is the unexpec-
tedness of the arrival of rare birds.
Ill --The Aquatic Bird House and the Pheasants and Cranes
The birds in this group appear to be of greater interest to the
general public probably because of larger size and the fact that they
are displayed under unusually advantageous conditions. The Aquatic
House is one of the best buildings in the Park architecturally. Entering,

one is confronted by a huge panorama in three dimensions forming
the back-wall of the indoor flying-cage which is approximately 100 feet
long. A seascape is cleverly painted there and superimposed on it
are projecting cliffs and rocks which give a remarkably naturalistic
effect. Two or three small rocky islets are in the foreground and the
water extends quite closely to the front of the cage. On this indoor
lagoon we find, during the winter months, a flock of fourteen Black
Swans, four Black-necked Swans, Egyptian Geese, Cereopsis Geese,
Maned Geese, and many varieties of Ducks including Sheldrakes from
Australia and New Zealand, both varieties of Pelicans from America,
also from Africa and Australia. So this pageant of striking bird life
has plenty of motion and colour. Several dead trees overhang the
water and on these as well as on the cliffs we see the stately White
Egret and his smaller more active relatives, the Snowy Heron and
the graceful Louisiana Heron. The dumpy Night Herons, Black-
crowned and Nankeen, majestic Great Blues, all impart an air of
watchful waiting, for these long-legged, long-necked waders are ever
on the look out for food. There is a beautiful pair of the African
Wood Ibis which have colourful beaks of butter yellow and a bright
red patch on the crown. The plumage is diffused with pink and the
feathers of the wings are edged with carmine sub-terminal bars while
the very tips are lace-edged with white. They are much more attractive
than our native Wood Ibis. We also keep some White Storks in this
cage as well as the Woolly-necked Storks, well-named, for the neck
of fuzzy wool is very noticeable ; African Spoonbills and several of
the lovely little Silver Gulls from Australia. One of these latter was
successfully bred last season. We also have several of the larger
Gulls, Herring, California, and Western. The large blue, Grey-headed
Gallinule is usually seen in a small group of others of his kind ; this
is a very handsome species, quite large and mostly blue of light and
dark shades. American Mudhens or Coots are active and graceful,
though of sombre colour. Three species of Flamingos are shown,
the stately African, white with pink wings, beak, and legs, the elegant
American Flamingo whose colour is like precious red coral, and the
smaller, less dainty Chilian Flamingo much like the African in colour*
but with grey legs with the joints and feet pink. Our Flamingos all

keep a pleasing colour probably because of their being outdoors in
summer on the formal pool and also because of the generous amount
of shrimp and dried flies in their food. Most of our water fowl are
on this formal pool during the summer months and many others.
American Whistling Swan, Common and Black Swans, Bean, Bernicle,
Canada, White-fronted, and Cereopsis G-eese as well as Mallards and
Pintails live on the 9 acre wild fowl pond the year round. Other
species of wildfowl drop on this pond during the spring and fall. We
except the Cereopsis and Black Swan as our winters are too severe
for them. Among the unusual specimens in the flying-cage out-
standing is the lone Galapagos Albatross. An Albatross is a rarity
in any zoo and we may pardonably consider it an achievement in
successfully keeping it under conditions so different from its natural
environment. In a wild state the Albatross spends most of its life
in the air, dropping to the water at night to swim about pursuing the
small squids and other forms of marine life on which it feeds, but in
the zoo it waddles about in a ridiculously pompous manner and very
seldom goes in the water. It gets its exercise by flapping its wings
which are very long and narrow. We have had this bird over four
years. It might be well to mention here our Galapagos Penguins :
these, too, have lived with us almost as long as the Albatross, in fact
one did come the same time. These are droll little fellows and very
amusing. We started keeping them in the Aquatic House but their
quarters were unsuitable for year-round confinement, so now we keep
them in the Galapagos Scene in the Reptile House. During the
summer we have a large run for them outdoors which they enjoy
for a few hours in nice weather, but they are always ready for a
plunge and swim in the roomy pool indoors. The Albatross and
the Penguins get both iodine and cod liver oil in their fish. Both
species require to be hand-fed though the Penguins often show greediness
in seizing a fish before it is handed to them.
At the north end of the building is a huge glass cage containing a
rocky background and a large, glass-fronted pool. This is- for Gannets
and Cormorants, and the latter are quite a show at feeding time for
they swim and dive like so many feathered fish. In summer these birds,
together with Gulls and American Pelicans, occupy part of the Seal

Rock in company with a herd of Sea Lions and a monster Elephant
Seal.
On the entrance side of the building are four large glass aviaries
--two on each side of the doors. In winter they house such rarities
as Shoebills, of which we have four fine specimens, Saddle-billed Storks,
Brush Turkeys, and Australian Cranes. The Shoebills are probably
the most grotesque of the large wading-birds. Of a uniform ashy-grey
colour, with lighter edges to the wing feathers, they are remarkable
for their huge, wooden shoe-like bills. These are hooked at the tip
and when the beak is opened the expression is very reptilian. Another
strange trait of the birds is the habit of standing motionless for long
periods. Visitors often ask if they are stuffed birds. Most captive
Shoebills require to be hand-fed and ours are no exception--it is said
that in Africa, their native habitat, where they are none too common
--they stand for hours in the shallow ponds waiting for their food
to venture around their feet when it is seized quickly enough. Their
movements in captivity are very deliberate, an excellent example of
slow motion. The Saddle-bills are probably the tallest as well as the
showiest of the Stork family. They stand nearly 5 feet tall and
are black and white in colour, the black with lustrous reflections of
purple and green. Their beaks are nearly or quite a foot long, bright
red with a black band across the middle and with a curious, saddle-like
skin across the base of the top. This is bright yellow as are the stirrup-
like pendants hanging from the lower mandible. The legs are black
with red joints and feet.
The southern end of the building presents an attractive swamp
scene profusely planted with umbrella grass at the water's edge and
with rubber trees and pandanus at each end. It is a sunny aviary
and has been a successful enclosure for the graceful shore-birds :
Avocets, Stilts, Plover, Godwits, Lapwings, Ruffs, Rails, etc., as
well as the beautiful Scarlet Ibis, Boatbill, small Herons, Roul-roul,
and Palawan Peacock Pheasant. It is one of the most attractive
of our indoor winter aviaries. In summer these indoor cages are
empty for their tenants are dispersed in outside cages.
The Cranes, which comprise a large flock of Crowned Cranes and
Demoiselles share a large park with various Antelopes. The large

Australian Cranes occupy a roomy, grassy tract with Kangaroos and
at time of writing are alternately incubating two buffy-white eggs.
They have selected a site farthest from where the keepers enter the
yard, and yet it is nearest to the public, being on the very edge of
the moat. It is amusing to watch the pair change off. If the female
is on the " nest " and the male is espied in the distance slowly coming
toward her she utters many throaty croakings until he is quite close,
then she rises up and there is much bowing and flapping of wings
and trumpet-like calls. She meanders off then and feeds leisurely
and he, after much preening, finally settled down carefully and pro-
ceeds to the quiet business of " setting ".
A very fine Wattled Crane is also a prized member of the rarer
birds ; it is one of the most elegantly formed and pleasingly coloured
varieties. A slaty cap sets off the snowy-white neck which is bounded
at the back and lower parts with black, this again in contrast to the
pale grey of wings and lower back. The pendant, white-feathered
wattles are very curious. In a wild state it is restricted to South-
West Africa and found only locally there. This bird lives amicably
with the two Secretary Birds and both species keep eternal vigilance
for any small living creature which may trespass in their roomy summer
run. The Secretary Birds are stately birds of prey very much attenuated
as to legs and neck and with quite long tails. They have an interesting
habit of viciously stamping to death any live food they can get. Then
they stand on it and tear it to pieces.
Our collection of Pheasants and other gallinaceous birds while
choice is not very extensive because the aviaries for them are not all
completed. Such fine varieties as the glittering Impeyans, Palawan
Peacock Pheasants, Swinhoe's, Beeve's, Elliott's, Soemmering's, White-
crested Kaleege, Golden, and Amherst's, are shown in good-sized runs
fitted at one end with good shelters and cement pools at the other.
There are also plantings for shelter. These runs also accommodate
a fine pair of Brush Turkeys ; the male is incessantly at work scratching
up a huge mound and every so often pursues his mate around, giving
her little rest. The only time they appear to get along at all well
is during the fall and winter months. Two varieties of Chachalaca,
a fine pair of Piping Guans, Bob-whites, Boul-roul, Vulturine, and

Helmeted Guinea Fowl, the Bed Jungle Fowl, and the very familiar
Grey-backed Trumpeter are outstanding. The tamest of all though
are the Screamers, of which three species are shown ; the Common,
the Horned, and the White-cheeked or Derby an. They are excessively
curious and if one were so inclined he might have one sit in his lap
any time.
We finish with the names of those birds which really should begin
the list, namely the Ostriches and their kin. Six fine Emus and three
Cassowaries, the Bennett's, the One-wattled, and the Australian,

By N. Wharton-Tigar
To-day there is such great interest taken in Pheasants that, prompted
by the Secretary Miss Knobel, I decided to tell readers of the collection
at Begent's Park.
Bealizing my ignorance on the subject, I approached Dr. Vevers,
who was most kind and helpful, and recommended the Monograph
of the Pheasants, by William Beebe, as a reference book, and also
gave instructions for Keeper E. Stimpson to show me the birds which
he was good enough to do.
I therefore made my way to the Pheasantries, and in passing was
thrilled by the sight of the young Stanley Crane now grown very
big, and also at the far end with a beautiful tame Lion cub playing
a cunning game with a child visitor !
However, the Pheasants. At once Tragopans caught my eye.
There are three varieties of these. Keeper Stimpson informed me
that the Crimson-horned ( Tragopan satyra Linnaeus), S.E. Himalayas,
was the most beautiful, among a trio of surpassing loveliness, perhaps
it is.
Next we examined Temmincks ; very tame, and a glorious red
[Tragopan temmincki J. E. Gray), Central China, and Blyth's [Tragopan
hlythi Yerdon). We then came to the Monaul Pheasant [Lophophorus
impeyanus) from South Kashmir. Beebe describes this bird as being

found always at a high altitude and says the cock is a gorgeous creature,
a living mirror of iridescence ; and the hen is the umber of dead leaves
and the smooth brown of lichens. As I gazed at the cock's sturdy
form, and waving crest, I was reminded of some Eastern Prince decked
out in all the splendour of a gala occasion.
There are several varieties of the Peacock Pheasant. At first
sight they are a little disappointing ; but when displaying, they are
charming. The Sumatran Bronze-tailed ( CJialcurus chdlcurus Lesson),
the Grey (Polyelectron bicalcaratum bicalcamtum Linnaeus), Germains
(.Polyplectron bicalcaratum germaine Eliot), and the Palawan (Poly-
electron napoleonis Lesson) from the Island of Palawan, Philippines.
This is an exceedingly rare Pheasant; it is also one of the most brilliant
and specialized of the entire genus, and confined to the small island
of Palawan. Crown and long hairy crest shining bottle green, mantle
and wings rich blue, bordered with green, back and tail black. This
Pheasant and one other to be described later came with Lord Moyne's
collection, when he took his yacht to the Far East, and cruised the
tiny and inaccessible islands in the Philippines and the coast of
New Guinea collecting many rare live mammals, reptiles, and birds,
returning in April, 1936. What a glorious adventure !
Before long the London Zoo may have the good fortune to acquire
live specimens of a new species of Pheasant or Peacock, recently found
by Mr. James P. Chapin, Assitant Curator, New York Natural History
Museum, in the Belgian Congo. A feather worn by a native chief
gave him a clue, and he did not rest till he traced the bird to its natural
haunts, and brought back several skins of both male and female.
I was privileged to meet Mr. Chapin at a friend's house, and examined
the skins of a fine pair he had with him. It certainly is a wonderful
bird. The name he has given it is Afropavo congensia. In size it is
about the same as an English Pheasant; the cock has a brush-like
white crest, 3 inches long, on a black crown--the bare neck is coloured
very bright red, it has a rich violet chest, and a patch of the same
colour on the shoulders and on the edges of the tail; back iridescent
bronzy green--the hen has the red bare neck and is in general colour
bronzy green and is also a very pretty bird. Mr. Chapin can be
congratulated on this sensational find in Africa !

The Zoo at Regent's Park has three varieties of the Argus Pheasant
--&apos;this is the huge Pheasant with a wonderful display. Of the Malay
Argus ( Argusianus argus Linnaeus) Beebe says this great Pheasant
lives a solitary life in the jungles of the Malay Peninsula ; they are
polygamus and the cocks take no share in hatching eggs or rearing
young. The Bornean Argus (. Argusianus grayii Elliott) is almost the
same, the chief difference being its slightly smaller size. There are
also examples of Bheinart's Ocellated Pheasant (Rheinarclius ocellatus
Elliott) from the mountain forests of Western Annan.
The Zoo has several different varieties of the Kaleege. Eirst
the beautiful well-known, and extensively bred Silver Pheasant or
Chinese Silver Kaleege ( Gennxus nycthemerus Linnaeus), Swinhoe's
Pheasant, or Kaleege ( Gennseus swinhoei Gould), Edward's Pheasant
(Gennseus edwardsi) from the Province of Kuang-tsi in Annam. Nothing
seems to be recorded about its haunts and habits and it must be
fairly rare.

I am convinced that many members of the A.S. must wonder why we
consider it necessary to advertise Ornamental Pheasants in the manner
we do. Such members might well argue that these beautiful birds should
advertise themselves. This is a comfortable way of regarding this matter
but whilst the general public of Great Britain and other countries are
fully alive to the attractiveness of such birds as those belonging to the
Parrot tribe, foreign Pinches and other small birds, not one person in a
thousand has ever viewed the beauty of the Ornamental Pheasants, other
than the common Covert Pheasant. It is therefore our duty to familiarize
our public with these birds and we have spent quite a lot of money in
arranging for them to be shown at many prominent bird shows. This
year also we have exhibited them at some of the large agricultural
shows. We supplied small pens measuring 2 by 1 yard and in these

P. J. Lambert--The Primley Zoo
exhibited such Pheasants as the Golden, Amherst, Eeeves, Silver, and
Swinhoe's. At a recent show held in the West of England four such
cocks caused quite a sensation. I am told that a very large majority
of those present had never seen a Golden Pheasant before and few had
even heard of them. One good person admitted he had seen a Golden
cock on the tin of a well-known brand of snuff but imagined it to be, to
use his own words, " Just a Picture." No single member of the Society
will benefit from these exhibitions--may I call them " Beauty Shows "--
but as time goes on the Society itself will undoubtedly benefit, for every
new fancier will, we trust, join the O.P.S. and every additional member
is helping in a most direct manner to save many Ornamental Pheasants
from final extinction. So it will be seen that although the showing
of Pheasants at these agricultural shows may seem far fetched, there is a
worthy motive behind all our activities. The Society has now perfected
its scheme for importing many rare Pheasants from India next spring
and we are in a position to promise those who will participate in this
scheme that if any birds die on the voyage they will be recompensed

membership that has enabled us to do this. Next month I hope to be
able to give some figures which will prove in no uncertain manner
that by the publication of our Journal in French as well as English
the Society has not only gained in prestige but also by an extraordinary
increase of membership.

I have read Captain Stokes's letter on the Primley Zoo with great
interest, yet tinged with sorrowful regrets that such high handed and
regretable action should have been taken against this great aviculturist,
Mr. H. Whitlby, by the Government officials and that delightful bench
of magistrates. We all know that this Zoo is essentially a place where

aviculturists resort in order to gain valuable information and most
certainly not for entertainment. May I be allowed to make a suggestion
in this matter ? A public body such as the A.S. can do little if not
backed up by many individual members. If one hundred or more
members insistently and tenaciously approached their respective
members of Parliament, I am convinced that in time the whole
subject would be gone into by Parliament and the present law
amended. It would be quite useless writing such members of Parliament
and then letting the matter drop. It would have to be done in a
systematic manner and in order to make my proposition productive I
consider it would be feasible to find out those members who would be
willing to plague and worry our local members into bringing the subject
before Parliament. Let us not forget that our Prime Minister is by no
means uninterested in aviculture and this should encourage us. I wonder
if any member of the A.S. will take action. I am sure Captain Stokes
would and if I can be of any assistance then I am willing to roll up my
shirt sleeves. The position as it now stands is scandalous and hardly
reflects credit on aviculturists in Great Britain. We all feel deeply
grieved that Mr. Whitley has been put to this indignity and let us do
something practical to remove such a shocking state of afiairs.
CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, ETC.
BIB FINCHES, OR DWARF MANNAKINS
(Spermestes nana)
Madam, --I have just been replying to some correspondence in the Foreign
Bird League Magazine, re the above, and it has occurred to me that some
of our members might be interested in the matter there referred to.
Owing to the ban on their importation from Madagascar, this prolific
little bird has almost disappeared from the market. Last autumn, I was
offered and secured two of the species, both of which turned out cocks. This
spring I placed them in an aviary with a number of Bengalese, with two
of which they immediately paired, and reared six youngsters.
These showed none of the Bengalee characteristics, and, though slightly
larger, were almost indistinguishable from pure Bib Finches.

This fact, together with the readiness of the cocks to pair with Bengalese,
and the high percentage of fertile eggs, raises the interesting question whether
the Bib Finch, rather than the Sharp-tailed, was not one of the original
ancestors of the ubiquitous Bengalee.
Next spring I intend to pair the hen Hybrids with their fathers, and
anticipate that the resulting young will be quite indistinguishable from normal
Bib Finches. If so, the further question arises, whether I have thus re-
established the species in this country !
J. E. Sweetie am.
P.S.--When writing, may I take the opportunity of adding a note in
connection with the article on Painted Finches which appeared in the August
Magazine. Subsequent experience leads me to question the suggestion there
made that young Painted Finches can be successfully reared by their own
parents without, at least, some live insect food. When the local supply of
live ants' cocoons give out, my pair deserted their week-old young, but they
are now (September) successfully rearing yet another brood with the aid of
cocoons imported from another part of the country. They can, however,
be reared successfully by Bengalese which have been brought up to use milk-sop
as the staple food for feeding the young entrusted to them.

(Erythrura viridifacies)
By J. Delacour and the Marquess Hachisuka
It is, indeed, a curious thing that an entirely new species of bird
should have been made known to science through a mass importation
of captive specimens, while it had remained undiscovered in its native
country, which, at the same time, is one of the best known, ornitholo-
gically speaking.
None of the numerous collectors who had visited the Philippine
Islands had ever obtained there a Parrot Finch. The first record of
such a bird from the Archipelago was by Mr. L. H. Taft, of the Forestry
Service, at Los Bagnos, near Manila in 1920. Several young Parrot
Finches were found dead near a wire netting fence, against which
they had flown. The four specimens sent to Washington for identifica-
tion were in poor conditions, and Dr. Richmond could only say that they
belonged to the genus Erythrura.
No more was heard of these mysterious birds till 1935, when we
heard that a large number of Parrot Finches, sent from Manila, were
sold in California as " Luzon Finches ". One of us acquired some at
once in Los Angeles and began to study them. Others were examined

J. Delacour--The Green-faced Parrot Finch
in 1936 in the New York Zoological Park. Many American ornitholo-
gists had obtained specimens ; on the whole, they did badly and most
of them died in the bird shops. However, some survived and even
nested, as it happened, in Mr. W. J. Sheffler's aviary in Los Angeles
in 1936.
At the same time, this bird was noticed by ornithologists in Manila,
where they were sold in great numbers in the streets. But they were
thought to be either imported birds that had become naturalized, or
migrants. Both assumptions sound most improbable.
The close study that we made of dead and live specimens in California
made us conclude that it was a new and distinct species of the genus
Erythrura, and we described it in the Bulletin of the B.O.C. for January,
1937, under the name of Erythrura viridifacies. It is the only member
of that genus in which the cock has an entirely green head, without any
red or blue markings. The opposite plate will, better than words, give
an idea of the colour and shape of the bird. It is evidently more closely
allied to the Pintail Nonparail ( E . prasina), from Malay, than to any
other Parrot Finch. Like the Pintail, it seems difficult at first to
accustom it to captive life, but, once established, it lives well on a
simple diet of seeds. There is a specimen now in the London Zoological
Gardens, which was kindly presented to us by Dr. R. A. Woods of
Los Angeles.
It is to be hoped that a consignment of these pretty birds will
sometime reach Europe.
The fact that an apparently common bird, living near a large town,
has long remained unnoticed is not so astonishing as it might seem.
The bird probably inhabits long grass, paddies, and marshy ground,
where little collecting is ever done, and it is easy for it to hide. A
similar case is that of the Eastern Avadavat, the so-called " Chinese "
(Amandava a. punicea), which is exported each year from Saigon by
the thousands, but has only once been collected wild by one of us,
with great difficulty. Only native bird-catchers, knowing the habits of
the birds perfectly, and their seasonal movements, can find them
in numbers.

In the September number of our Magazine Mrs. Wharton-Tigar
describes various foreign songsters. Having lived for over twenty-
seven years in China and Japan, I take the liberty to give my experience
with some Softbills of these countries.
Pride of place I must give to the Spectacled Laughing Thrush
(Janthocincla canorum (L.)). Tastes differ, of course, but in my opinion
a really good Huamee (the Chinese name for our bird, meaning
" Flowery Eyebrow ") beats a very good Shama. As with other
Songsters, there is naturally a great difference as to vocal qualities
amongst the Huamees. Keally good singers rarely reach the European
bird-market. What is commonly offered here are mostly hens, which
do not sing, or freshly caught young cocks which are often poor singers
and as a rule very wild. A well-trained Huamee cock with a good voice
is a delightful pet and highly prized by the Chinese bird-fancier, who
is rarely willing to part with such a bird. Of the same family I have
found the small Masked Babbler (J. cinereiceps) a good singer and an
agreeable cagebird. He is not often imported. Also Berthemy's Laughing
Thrush (J. berthemyi) has very clear notes and is a good bird for the
aviary. Of Bockthrushes occurring in China, I have had Monticola
gularis and Monticola philippinensis, the Whitethroated and the
Asiatic Blue Bockthrush. The former has a lovely song and is a very
handsome bird. It passes the Yangtze valley during spring and autumn
migration, and a few examples are then generally in the Shanghai
bird market, but if one wants them, one has to be quick, for they are
eagerly sought for by the Chinese fanciers. Only very few have come
to Europe during the last years. Of the Asiatic Blue Bockthrush,
I had one cock which was one of the tamest birds I have come across
and full of character. He sang very freely, not loud but very very
sweet and also late in the evening when the light was on. I think
this species has nested in Mr. Ezra's aviaries.
A good singer well known by most of us is the Dyal Thrush. The
Chinese keep it chiefly for its fighting qualities and the birds of the
Shanghai and Hongkong market are all hand-reared and consequently

A. Hampe--Singing Birds of the Far East
not very good singers. I have, however, listened to the song of the wild
bird in Sumatra and Singapore and much appreciated this performance.
The Chinese call this Thrush with a very pretty name, viz. " Seshee "
meaning four times happy, because it sings during all the four seasons.
The cagebird par excellence of the Chinese fancier is the Mongolian
Lark. For my taste its song is too loud, but it is certainly an A 1
mimic, imitating all the songs of other birds it hears and besides all
sorts of noises as the wheezing of the wheelbarrow and the mewing
of the cat both dear to the Chinese ear. Its Chinese name is " Paling ",
meaning " Hundred tunes ". Of smaller Chinese Softbills I must
mention the Rubythroat (Calliope camtchatcensis), the Siberian Blue-
throat (Cyanecula suecica), and the two kinds of White Eyes (Zosterops
simplex and erythropleurus), occurring in China. All have soft sweet
songs, become very tame and are hardy. Their Chinese name is Hung
Tang (Red Breast), Lae Tang (Blue Breast), and Sinoe (Beautiful
Eye). I will finish my series of Chinese Songsters with two of the
most graceful and desirable birds, viz. the Chinese Forktail (Henicurus
leschenaulti), and the Larvivora cyane. The Forktail is not a bird for
a cage, but I hardly can think of a better inmate for an aviary with a
small pool. I have heard its song only during autumn and winter,
and found it very soft and sweet, but Mr. Caldwell, the author of the
excellent book, South China Birds , says : During mating season the
male bird has a wonderful sweet warbling song." In captivity it wants
good care (like every bird), and it is certainly difficult to bring to
Europe ; for it is very aquatic and tries to wash every morsel of its
food, so it easily gets wet and catches a fatal cold. In Chekiang I once
watched a hen gathering moss, etc., for her nest. Every bit was carried
to a near stream and thoroughly washed before being taken to the
nesting site. The Larvivora --I think it has no English name, one might
call it " Blue Ground Warbler "--is a very beautiful, elegant bird,
navy-blue above, silky-white below. Its song is very agreeable and
varied and Pere David says it is composed " de petits couplets
detaches ". Only very few are for sale generally in May on the Shanghai
market, and it has rarely been imported.
In Japan the fancy takes care of quite different birds. A
great favourite there is the Japanese Bush Warbler (Horeites

cantans), Japanese name " Uguisu ", which, is generally trans-
lated with " Nightingale It is a small, unobtrusive grey bird of
Tit-like behaviour. Its song is very vigorous and melodious, though
a bit short and monotonous. Nevertheless, it is well worth acquiring.
The hen is exceedingly small. The Japanese White Eye [Zosterops
japonicus) is also often kept in Japan on account of its song which is
very pleasing. Like all White Eyes, it gets very tame. Japanese
name " Meshiro ", meaning " White Eye ". Both the Loochow Robin
[Erithacus Jcomadori), and the Japanese Robin (Erithacus akahige)
are very desirable birds with good vocal powers, especially so the
Loochow Robin. It is strictly protected and therefore difficult to
procure. The Japanese name of the Loochow Robin is " Akahige ",
meaning Red Beard, that of the Japanese Robin " Komadori "--
" Horsebird," as its song reminds one of the neighing of the horse.
A bird combining fine colour with a good song is the Blue Flycatcher,
which also occurs in China. Japanese name " O'ruri ". I will
mention a Chinese bird which is not a Songbird, but belongs to the
Crow tribe. I mean the Occipital Blue Pie. When I first kept this bird,
I was very astonished that such a big bird can sing so sweetly. And it
also learns to talk. A young bird which I had given to the small Zoo
in Shanghai surprised me one day with the words " Come on Tommy ",
pronounced with a very clear voice. He had learned this small sentence
from a lady who visited him regularly. This is a very fine bird for an
aviary and his near cousin from Formosa ( Urocissa casrulea), is even
more showy. We see that the East presents us with a lot of good
singers. There are certainly a good many more in far off Szetchuan
and Yunnan which have never come to Europe. I think especially
of the very fine Grandala coelicolor.
Indeed, the man who created the often used saying : " The birds
of the Far East have no song and the flowers no fragrance," certainly
never listened to the song of the Huamee nor smelled the fragrance of
the " Lammay " (Chinese flowering shrub blossoming in December
and January).

About the middle of last July a farmer who lives about six miles from
Eoxwarren Park rang me up to tell me that he had seen two strange
birds in his field and would I send some one to look at them. My man,
Jones, went over at once and found the two birds were young Sarus
Cranes, about a week old. The parents, who are full-winged birds,
evidently nested in the field and when they were disturbed during the
hay-making had deserted their young. The two chicks were brought
home and put under a Bhode Island Bed hen. The bigger chick of the
two would keep on pecking the head of the smaller one till he killed it.
The other one did well under the Bhode Island Bed hen and is now
practically full grown. The chick was never small enough to go under
the hen, but he always put his head under her and was brooded by
her. She still goes after the grown-up Crane, but he takes no notice
of her and will sometimes even peck her. The accompanying photo-
graphs may interest members.

A pair of these birds were purchased for me in France, and on
arrival were turned out in one of my aviaries where there were a good
many other birds. After several attempts a nest was built in a box on
the wall about eight feet from the ground. The box was half-filled with
grass, and a small hole was made in the top. Four eggs were laid by
4th June. Both birds took turns at incubating. The eggs were oval-
shaped and a trifle smaller than a thrush's egg. It was a bluish grey,
slightly speckled at the broad end, with reddish brown spots. Two
young were hatched out on the 18th June. The other two eggs were

young bird. It was reared on insectivorous food, mealworms, and gentles.
The plumage of the young bird is exactly like an adult hen. An
excellent picture of these very handsome birds appeared in the
Magazine of February, 1935. I believe this is the first time this bird
has been successfully reared in captivity.

the position of the nest being some four feet from the ground. A couple
of times the eggs fell out of the flimsy structure, so a piece of half-inch
wire netting was fixed on the site of the nest. The birds immediately
built on the wire and reared one young one. Later they laid again in
the same nest and reared one more. On each occasion only one egg was
laid. The diet provided (unaltered during the time the young were
being fed by their parents) is chopped apple, pear, and banana, and
bread and milk. Has anyone ever recorded that, in the female, the
feathers of the thigh and under tail coverts are spotted black, the same
parts being entirely white in the male ? This is certainly the case with
our pair, but I am not in a position to say whether the distinction is
constant.

It is needless to mention that disappointments were not lacking.
A hen Brown's Parrakeet whiled away the breeding season by laying
numerous infertile eggs. However, another pair of these birds has
recently been acquired, so we hope for better luck.
A pair of Australian Cat-birds (A. crassirostris) completed a beautiful
nest in a Cupressus when a lone Regent Bower-bird came along and laid
an egg in it and proceeded to attempt to incubate. This apparently
disgusted the rightful owners of the nest for they went near it no more.
I have purposely left the Queen Alexandra's Parrakeets ( Northipsitta
alexandrse) till the last because it is considered that their doings warrant
description in some detail.
We started the 1936-37 season with two males and two females,
this being the first occasion that we had possessed a true pair of these
rare and beautiful birds. Number 1 pair was composed of a cock hatched
in the wild state during the season of 1933-34, and a wild-caught hen
one year old. Nine eggs w r ere laid, but considering this to be too many
we removed three and placed them under a hen Brown's Parrakeet,
which hatched two of them but unfortunately they died at an early
age. Of the six eggs left with the Alexandra's all hatched. One died
when about seven days old, and the rest turned out to be perfect
specimens. The incubation period appears to be twenty-one days, and
the young remain in the log for about thirty-five days. The male of
this pair was a perfect example of what a father should be, and did
equally as much of the feeding of the young as the mother. The log
was removed from the cage after the pair had reared their family, for
it was not thought advisable to permit the hen to lay again.
No. 2 pair were both young birds hatched during the previous year
in the wild state. The first clutch of eggs consisted of five, three of
which were hatched and reared. It became apparent that they desired
to nest again and, as they had not raised a large family, they were allowed

to do so. This time six eggs were laid, five of which were hatched and
reared. Again all perfect specimens, and we thus finished the breeding
season with thirteen young from two pairs ! It might be mentioned
that No. 2 cock was never observed to feed the young, although he fed
his mate.
It is interesting to note that in the case of both pairs, the cocks were
allowed to remain in the breeding cage during the entire period of
incubation and the rearing of the young which only goes to show that
in aviculture, as with so many other things, one cannot lay down hard
and fast rules. A friend who has been less fortunate with his cock
Alexandras, recently told the writer " to wait and see ", so it will be
interesting to await events this season (they have just started to lay)
and see whether any of our cocks which were so well-behaved last year,
turn murderers this year.
Our Queen Alexandra's Parrakeets are given the following grain
mixture : 3 parts canary seed, 1J parts sunflower, 1 part white millet,
and half parts each of hulled oats and of hemp. Apple is always
provided, and green food as well in the shape of lettuce, thistle tops,
seeding grasses, and silver beet : in the latter only the stem is
consumed.

(Fringillaria tahapisi)
By Major M. S. Aldham
This pair, described as Nyasaland Rock Buntings, was given to me
late in the season of 1936, having been privately imported from Nyasa-
land. Before I go any further, I should like to say how indebted I am
to Dr. Hopkinson for his assistance in identifying the species. Eventu-
ally the adult pair was sent to him, and he pronounced them definitely
F. tahapisi.
According to Shelley ( The Birds of Africa , vol. iii), F. striolata is
similar, but differs in having a white chin and crop. F. septemstriata
is also similar, but distinguished by having a uniform patch of cinanmon

on the upper surface of the closed wings. In F. tahapisi, putting it
very briefly, the cock bird has the head and throat black, with seven
white bands from the bill to back of neck.
In September, 1936, the pair was turned into an outdoor aviary
24 by 8 by 9 feet high, 10 by 8 feet of which is closed shelter.
On 23rd October, one egg was laid, greenish-brown mottled all over.
The hen had great difficulty with the next (soft-shelled) egg. However,
with the aid of heat she made a very good recovery, but I separated the
sexes, and had the hen caged indoors until the following spring, when
the pair was again put out in the same aviary.
Early in June a nest was completed in a site which I will describe
later, 7 feet above the ground in the shelter. The nest, a very small
one in proportion to the size of the birds, was composed of odds and
ends of heather and coarse grass. It was lined with coarse grass, no
very fine material being used, though available. The first and only egg
was laid on cr about 5th June. The cock took no part in the incubation.
On 18th June the chick was hatched, and on the evening of 1st July it
left the nest. The hen alone reared the chick until it left the nest. She
did not seem to want the cock to have anything to do with the job.
She had quite a varied diet, including soft food which she wouldn't
touch, and she reared practically entirely on soaked canary, meal-
worms, ants' eggs, a lot of flaked cuttle, and chickweed and lettuce.
Soaked sprays and other millets were hardly touched. As soon as the
young of this nest and the next could feed themselves neither they nor
the parents had any more use for mealworms. The cock spent a lot
of time catching insect life in the flight. Soaked seed was supplied
to them on the ground of the flight, where they liked it, and also in
dishes in the shelters, which wasn't so popular.
On 18th July I found that the hen had two chicks just hatched in
her second nest, and two eggs. That struck me as being quick work,
as she must have started laying only a day or two after the first nest
chick left the nest. This (second) nest was also constructed of quite
rough material, this time in an old Hartz cage screened with heather.
On 1st August the first of the four chicks left the nest, and on

She laid one more, and later on deserted them, possibly owing to
prowling cats, or she may have thought she had done enough. All
the young (five) were left with the parents till 24th September, by
which time they were moulting. The plumage of the young is similar
to that of the adult hen, in fact it is difficult to distinguish them from
the hen.
Naturally enough they spend a lot of time on the ground, and have
a habit of rising almost vertically if scared. Their flight is somewdiat
erratic, reminding one of the Diamond Dove's dashing style. They
are active long after dusk, and prefer to roost on the ground in the
flight rather than in the shelter.
They are quite hardy, as far as my experience with them goes.
This particular pair bred easily, which I suppose is largely a matter
of luck, as Dr. Hopkinson is of the opinion that the species has not
been previously bred in Europe.
The nest " site " referred to above is just a fairly heavy
piece of board about 20 by 7 by 1 inch, hung vertically by a
stout triangulated wire at the top back (not a small screw-eye) on a
a screw-hook in the wall. Near the bottom centre a piece of 2 by
1 inch batten 3 or 4 inches long is fastened to project in front by nailing
from the back of board. This forms a base to which heather or other
screening material is attached. Any nest receptacles, such as Hartz
cage, box, or wire-bottom tray, can be securely fastened to the board
well down into the screening. The whole assembly can be easily lifted
down for examination, cleaning, or change of position without creating
a din in the aviary. It all sounds very elementary, and no doubt the
idea is as old as the hills. But it has always given good results with
me, and, in the case of these Buntings, it allowed of examination of the
nest (at the right moment) without causing any disturbance.

NEW AUSTRALIAN STAMPS PORTRAY INDIGENOUS BIRDS.

By our own Correspondent --E. W. R.
The new one-shilling stamp of Australia portrays a Lyre Bird.
The scientific name, Menura, of the genus is so called from the crescent-
shaped form of the spots on its tail, the tail itself being shaped like a
lyre. The name was given to the bird by General Davies in 1800. There
are several reasons why the Lyre Bird should be preserved. From a
purely utilitarian point of view it is of value, for it is insectivorous
and preys upon insects which prefer orchard fruit to their natural bush

food. But the bird has as well a national and sentimental value. Next
to the Emu it is the most typical Australian bird. It is peculiar to
Australia, for in no other country is it found.
Comparatively speaking it is rara avis, even in Australia itself, for
it is only to be seen in the most secluded parts of Victoria and New
South Wales. It is the native Pheasant. The aborigines call it " Beleck-
Beleck ". There are three species, Superba, Alberta, and Victorias. The
general plumage is glossy brown, shaded with black and silver-grey,
and the ornate tail of the male bird is black barred. The Lyre Birds
live in the densest recesses of the fern gullies of the Dividing Bange,
with the Satin Bird and the Bell Bird as their neighbours.
They are the most shy of birds, and are oftener heard than seen.
Their notes are heard more frequently than they are recognized, for
they are consummate mimics and ventriloquists. They imitate to
perfection, the notes of most other birds--the united voicing of a flock
of Parrakeets, the barking of dogs, the sawing of timber, and the
clink of the woodman's axe. Thus it is that the Menura has earned
for itself the name of " The Australian Mocking Bird ". Parrots and
Magpies may be taught to speak ; as a mimic the Lyre Bird requires
no teacher. For many years since 1888 the Lyre Bird was the design
of the eightpenny postage stamp of New South Wales.
The new sixpenny Australian stamp also depicts a bird, the
Kookaburra, more commonly known as the Laughing Jackass, and
shortened often to just plain " Jack The name is obvious to anyone
who has heard his rollicking laugh, which sounds like Koo Koo Koo
Ka Ka Ka. He has also been called the " Settler's Clock ", for the
regularity with which he laughs in the morning and at night.
The scientific name for the Laughing Jackass, Dacelo gigantea,
was given to it by W. E.. Leach in 1916, as an anagram, or transposition
of the Latin Alcedo, a Kingfisher, as it is the Great Brown Kingfisher
of Australia. Some have erroneously thought that the name was
derived from the French word, " jacasse," derived from jaquot, a name
popularly given to Parrots, but a quotation of Collins, in 1798, who
refers to the Laughing Jack, disposes of the supposed French origin.
It is a nationally protected bird, and forbearance has made it tame and
fearless.

Occasionally one sees odd Spicifer Peafowl offered for sale in
Singapore, mainly young ones. Two of these were purchased, but what
derelicts they were, very much under-sized and under-nourished, but
with good food they soon came round. Unfortunately one of them,
only the size of a Bantam when we purchased it, started to grow at
such an alarming rate that it seemed to outgrow its strength and
developed rickets on board the ship coming home. In spite of every care
it died soon after I landed it in England. The other bird, which we
fondly hoped was a male, grew up into a fine bird, and consorted with
a small party of Blue Crossoptilons which were kept loose in the garden.
In spite of the bird developing spurs and displaying, our doubts
regarding its sex were dispelled when it commenced to lay eggs.
This bird had the extraordinary habit of putting its head up
exhaust pipes of cars when they were running, so we had to be careful
and leave no cars running for fear the bird should gas itself.
There is no doubt that the Spicifer Peafowl is one of the most
gorgeous and dignified birds in existence ; it is much finer and more
beautifully coloured than its well-known cousin. There seems to be some
confusion as to what is a true Spicifer. I have seen many very large
examples, some standing nearly four feet high, which have been much
larger than either the Common or the Spicifer, but these must have
been either hybrids or birds of an intermediate species from the district
where the range of the two species meet. These birds have a great deal
of blue in their plumage, whereas the true Spicifer has no blue except
the centre spot of the " eyes ". The cock birds I saw in Malaya were
truly regal. I have seen nothing like them in Europe.
The long upstanding crest at the back of the head and the long legs
give the bird a much more dignified appearance than the Common
bird. As well as the much more beautiful plumage these birds have the
great advantage over the others in so much as they do not give vent to
the awful cat-like screams of the Indian bird, which are liable to be
trying to both the family's and the neighbour's nerves. But the bird
is far from silent, as its scientific name of muticus would imply.

The Spicifers in the London Zoo always seem very poor specimens
and give no idea of what the bird is like in its wild state.
The garden in Johore with its hibiscus, coconut-palms, and other
tropical flowering trees, was a great attraction to the Sun-birds and
Flower-peckers. Of the Sunbirds there were four varieties.
Scientists have often given birds silly and inappropriate names,
but no birds are better named than the Sunbirds. On the sun-drenched
mountain sides of Africa, sucking the sweet-tasting Leonotis flowers,
beneath the dazzling sun in India, above the deep forest in Malaya, or
flitting around the coconut palms in the full glory of the tropical day
in the South Seas, he is always the same, a bird of the sun. True there
are a few exceptions, there always are, for one or two species never
leave the confines of the gloomy forests in Central Africa. But seek
out a gaudy blossom in the tropics of the " Old World " and you will be
sure to find him there, a glittering gem of ethereal beauty, sustaining
himself on the nectar of those exotic blooms. I often felt qualms of
conscience in that far away garden of hibiscus and orchids when I set
my traps for those elves of the sunlight. What right had I to take
away from those realms of sunshine to gloomy northern lands those
scintillating little fairies of the palm blossoms ?
The Common Sunbird in the garden in Johore was the Brown-
throated or Malaccan (Anthreptes malaccensis), a brilliant bronzy
greenish purple above with a brown throat edged with purple and
bright yellow under parts. This species was always around the bungalow
and one was always sure to see it either around the hibiscus flowers or
on the flowering sprays of the coconut palms, these latter were a great
attraction to all the honey-sucking birds. As the hibiscus flowers were
so large, the birds could not feed from the front of them as there was
nowhere to perch, so they would settle behind the flowers and force the
beak through the base of the petals. Often one saw the males dis-
playing to their sombre-coloured mates, flitting about the trees with
their brilliant yellow pectoral plumes expanded. These resembled small
fans on each side of the breast. The Malaccan is the commonest of the
Malayan Sunbirds and is found about the gardens of houses in and
around the towns. Sometimes it comes into the verandahs of the houses
to search for spiders, of which all Sunbirds seem very fond.

Sometimes the whole garden seemed to be filled with those radiant
little gems, Van Hasselt's Sunbird (Leptocoma brasiliana), but their
visits were very spasmodic. They appear to arrive in small parties
until after a time there seems to be a hundred of them, and their sharp
metallic notes can be heard from every flowering tree and shrub. In
fact, this seemed to be one of the few species of Sunbird which shows
any tendency to flock ; I suppose this is due to its pacific disposition.
In captivity many of these birds can be kept together and they show
little or no inclination to fight, a rare thing with Sunbirds. Had I not
known what the birds were I would have sworn that they were Humming
Birds, for they hovered around the flowers looking quite black in the
distance, as Humming Birds usually do. Sometimes a male would alight
on a slender twig, lift up his head, and show his blazing amethyst
gorget, very much in the manner of a Humming Bird. Then, again, I
sometimes mistook them for the Giant Blue-black Bees which haunted
the garden and bored holes in the woodwork of the bungalow. When in
a wild state or freshly caught there are few birds which can equal this
one for sheer beauty, in fact one is left with a sense of amazement that
a bird could be so beautiful. No artist could paint or no writer draw
a pen picture which could adequately portray this living gem. Few
Humming Birds can equal it, either in the radiance of its colouring or
in the elegance of its form. It is certainly one of the loveliest of the
Sunbird family, which is saying a good deal.
Unfortunately I know of no bird whose iridescent plumage so
quickly fades in captivity as this one, and in a short time it is soon
but a faded semblance of the radiant gem which hovered around the
scarlet hibiscus in that far away sunlit garden near the sea in Malaya.
I will try and describe its colouring, but my description must fall short
of giving anything like a true picture of this exquisite little atom of
feathered life. The whole head and nape are a scintillating Humming
Bird green, which in the wild bird glows like a green light. The upper
back, neck, cheeks, and wings intense velvety black ; the lower back
and tail coverts, which are long and each feather distinct, are a
scintillating steel blue, which is also the colour of the lesser wing-coverts
which, when the wings are expanded, form a crescent across the back.
The tail is deep shining purple blue. The throat and upper breast can

only be described as the colour of a glowing fire seen through amethyst-
coloured glass. The lower breast and under parts are intense blood red.
After a few months in captivity the bird is almost unrecognizable.
The female is a very drab little creature, dull olive above and yellowish
olive below.
This species is not common except in certain restricted localities,
and its habitat is the mangrove swamps bordering the coastal regions.
One day I purchased in Singapore a cage containing eight of these
lovely creatures, and when I first had them I used to spend hours
watching them and admiring their unsurpassable beauty. I rather think
that the Van Hasselt's Sunbirds which I had in captivity used to
attract others, for sometimes a flock passing high up over the clearing
looking like tiny black bees, but distinguishable by their call note,
would be answered by the captive birds, and then the small flock would
come down and search about the flowers, carrying on meanwhile a
spirited conversation with the birds in the cage.
Altogether I had over a hundred Sunbirds of one species or another ;
what did I want with a hundred ? the reader will perhaps ask. Well,
first of all there were the eight Van Hasselt's---who could have resisted
buying such radiant little gems, and what would have happened to them
if I had not purchased them ? They would perhaps have lasted a few
days more on their sugar-and-water diet, and then . . . the garbage bin.
Then there was another bird of the same species, a poor sticky derelict
at a dollar and a half, but what was that if it meant saving his life ?
He slowly got worse, an abscess formed over his eye, which temporarily
went blind, the swelling was the size of a pea, which was huge for a mite
only a few inches long ; it seemed a hopeless case, but I did my best
with him, and lo ! and behold a miracle happened. He recovered and
grew so tame that he would let me pick him up. He was intelligent
as well, and I became very fond of him and I had him until quite recently,
but his colours were very much faded and he was a poor little ghost of
his former self. Well that only accounts for nine birds. I asked a dealer
in Singapore to get me a few others, and left strict instructions how they
were to be fed, and even bought the food, but when I called later I
found that there were over ninety birds . . . what could I do ? If I left
them they would all die on their sugar-and-water diet, for my

instructions for feeding them had been totally disregarded. Half of the
birds seemed to be dying, and I stayed up most of the night trying to
save them by dipping their beaks in the nectar and trying to make them
drink. . . . poor things ! The shock of their capture and wrong feeding
had been too much for their fragile little bodies. Another time when I
called on the dealer I found another fifty birds ; these he was expecting
to sell to someone else, but as the intending customer did not take them
I had them, though half were nearly dead. Amongst this lot were six
cocks and six hens of the Macklot's Sunbird ( Chalcostetha calcostetha)
and a single male of the exquisite [Mthopyga siparaja), the former very
much like a larger edition of the Van Hasselt's but with a wedge-shaped
tail and with the metallic colouring much duller, the lower breast
being a deep purple instead of red, and the back being metallic green
instead of steel blue, the chief difference being the brilliant yellow
pectoral plumes which are very conspicuous against the black plumage.
Except when displaying a Sunbird never shows its pectoral plumes
unless it is about to die.
The little siparaja is described in the book, Birds of Singapore, as
" A bright jewel-like bird red above and below, except on the abdomen,
which is smoky black, like the petals of an hibiscus ; yellow rump and
dark blue tail."
Amongst the other birds were a good many of the Purple-breasted
or Malayan Yellow-breasted (. Leptocoma ornata), larger than the Van
Hasselt's, of a yellowish olive above, brilliant yellow below, with the
forehead and upper breast a rich shining purple, the colour of a * 4 blue-
bottle " fly. I caught quite a number of this species and also the Brown-
throated with a very ingenious trap made by the natives.
Both the Yellow-breasted and the Brown-throated were common in
the garden in Johore, but they seemed to differ in their habits. The latter
never came very low down and were always very wild and wary, and
seemed only to frequent the fragrant flower-spikes of the coconut-palms.
The other bird was extremely tame and familiar and one could watch it
only a few feet away. Besides haunting the coconut-flowers it could be
seen searching the low-flowering shrubs, being especially fond of the
hibiscus. Several males used to visit my captive birds, alighting on
their cages and endeavouring to reach the nectar in the pots and also
the grapes, of which these Sunbirds were very fond.

Out of all the birds I purchased I managed to save about a hundred,
but had I have known what was to happen to them later I would have
released them all then and there. A Chinese carpenter made separate
cages for each bird, and very neat ones they were. Unfortunately the
only honey I could get in Singapore was some cheap Australian, which
must have contained some preservative. This was my undoing, for
in spite of every care I lost about half my birds when about two weeks
out on the homeward voyage, through bow T el trouble caused by the
honey. One after another, though in perfect plumage, they dropped off.
How I hated to have to watch these exquisite little gems fade and die
on my hands. There is something so heartbreaking about seeing a
Sunbird die, more so I think than any other bird. I could have wept
at losing so many of these lovely birds. One can only hope that they
are sucking the nectar from those radiant blossoms which are said to
grow by the shores of the distant elysian shores, " where the flowers
never fade, but in changing, their magical sweetness renew/'
Of the various species of Flowerpeckers which inhabit Malaya
I only saw one species in a wild state, the Orange-bellied (Dicseum
trigonostigma). These are the world's smallest birds, except certain
species of the Humming Birds ; an ordinary Wren looks a giant com-
pared to them. Nearly all are brilliantly coloured and in size are about
3 inches long. I had previous^ kept these birds in England and found
them, very short-lived ; they seemed to die of bowel trouble, no doubt
caused by the honey in their nectar feed. The more I see of the trouble
caused by the indiscriminate use of honey, the more I am convinced
that it is more harmful than beneficial to nectar-feeding birds.
Although so much smaller than the Sunbirds, I found these birds
take about twice as much food as the Sunbirds do. They greatly relish
soft fruit such as sweet grapes and ripe pear. The first of these birds
I purchased in Malaya I found when looking for birds in the market-
place in Malacca, a dreamy old tropical town which, like its name,
breathes of the romance of distant ages. There were few birds except
the two species of Doves which one sees in nearly every market, a few
Java Sparrows, and in a cage full of Doves were two tiny Flower-
peckers trying to feed upon some bad banana on the bottom of the cage,
and only a few hours from dying. I really did not want them, but I felt

that I really must purchase them just to try to save their lives. I
think they cost with cage and all about 30 cents, or 8Jd. We still had
a long journey to Port Dickson in the state Negri Sembilan, so we
purchased a tin of condensed milk at the nearest native store and,
stopping for lunch at the nearest rest house, procured a tin-opener,
a spoon, some sugar, and cup of hot water, and so saved the lives of
these wretched little creatures. In a day or two they got most of the
stickiness off their plumage, and in time turned into beautiful specimens.
In a few days they were so tame that I could pick them up. This species
(the Orange-bellied Plower-pecker) was very common in the garden in
Johore, and one could usually see them around the blossoms of the
coconut-palms but, unlike the Sunbirds, they never came low down to
visit the flowering shrubs or creepers. Fortunately there were several
young coconut-palms and their sprays of flowers were only about twelve
to fifteen feet from the ground and here it was quite easy to study them.
Under ordinary conditions these birds live only on the tops of the forest
trees, and from such a distance they look more like bees than birds.
The Flower-peckers are easily distinguished from the Sunbirds by their
more melodious call-notes, wdiich are very Finch-like. The call of a
Sunbird is harsh and metallic, and rather like that of a Stonechat. On
the other hand, the song of some Sunbirds is very sweet and sustained,
especially that of the Van Hasselt's. The Flower-peckers in the garden
were very tame and exceedingly inquisitive ; we used to fix up, by
means of a pulley, a trap-cage by the coconut flowers, and the sight of
it would at once attract these birds, who came around and examined
it with the greatest of interest, even though it contained a Sunbird as
a decoy. If a male Flower-pecker was put in the cage it would almost
immediately attract another who would try his utmost to enter the
cage to fight the captive male. These birds are terribly pugnacious,
much more so than any Sunbird. I once put in a cage temporarily
with a pair of Orange-bellied, a pair of Scarlet-backed ; on my return
in a few minutes I found the cock with both eyes pecked out and the
hen so injured that she died in a short time.
One frequently sees these birds hovering in the manner of Humming
Birds. In colour the male of the Orange-bellied is a slaty blue-black
above, the throat grey, with the breast, lower parts and back bright

orange ; the brightly coloured back is hardly ever seen owing to the
birds keeping to the top of the trees.
In amongst the lot of Sunbirds I purchased was a pair of the lovely
Scarlet-backed Flower-peckers (Dicaeum. cruentatum ignitum), a midget
amongst birds with a body measurement of only 1J inches, the beak
and tail adding another 2 inches. The chief feature of this bird is a
broad stripe of sealing-wax red which runs from the beak over the head
to the tail; this is set off by the rest of the body, which is glossy black.
These birds were nearly dying when I purchased them, the hen having
fits. The dealer had had a lot, but through improper feeding all had
succumbed except the two I purchased, and these, as mentioned
previously, were killed by a pair of Orange-bellied.
Two species of Bee-Eaters are common in Malaya, at least in the
part I stayed in, the Chestnut-backed ( Merops viridis) and the Blue-
tailed (Merops superciliosus javanicus). The former bird appears to
be very common in the south of the Peninsula, while the latter is found
towards the north. The habits of both of these beautiful swallow-like
birds are the same ; all the food, which consists of flying insects, is
taken in the air. They take up a point of vantage often on the telegraph
wires or perhaps on a garden fence, and from there make periodical
excursions into the air to capture their prey. Owing to the tiny feet
(two of the toes on each foot are joined together almost to the claw)
the bird leads an entirely arboreal existence, never descending to the
ground.
How these fragile-looking birds are able to tunnel many feet into
solid earth either in a cliff or into the walls of a quarry, has always
been a mystery to me.
Sometimes flocks will hawk for insects in the evenings, high in the
sky like Swifts ; during this period they are frequently very loquacious.
A pair of the Blue-tailed were sent to me, but all efforts to keep them
failed. I used to hand-feed them, but they immediately cast up the
food, and as they seemed to be fading I released them before it was too
late. Later on tw^enty-five of these birds were sent to me as " Fly-
catchers ". They arrived late at night with their wings and tails terribly
messed up with the rubber solution with which they had been caught.
I had to leave the wretched birds until morning when, after I had fed

all my birds, I started to give each one a petrol bath before releasing it.
One or two could fly, but the others needed an awful lot of work before
they were anything like clean ; however, the petrol fumes were too
much for the birds, and after the messed parts had been ridded of the
adherence the birds appeared as if dead. There were twenty lovely
corpses in a row. I felt like a murderer. After a few hours the birds
seemed to " come to ", and as they regained their equilibrium I released
them. Most were nearly starving after their two days' fast. However,
they were soon catching winged insects and seemed very much at home.
A few remained around the garden, but the strong-winged ones were
soon away. I often wondered if they flew back to Negri Sembilan,
where they were sent from.
Bee-Eaters are entirely unsatisfactory subjects for aviculture unless
one has unlimited patience and a large outdoor aviary for the summer
and a heated one for the winter. They seldom feed on insectivorous
food, and have to be supplied with live insects. Owing to the smallness
of the feet all their exercise is taken flying, and they never move about
on a perch. When forcibly feeding the birds I noticed a peculiar arrange-
ment with regard to the beak, for so far it was exceedingly difficult to
open, being as tight as a clam ; after it was open for about half an inch
or so, a hinge arrangement seemed to give and the beak suddenly became
loose and could be moved about with ease. This is no doubt something
to do with the holding of insects. Bee-Eaters rank as one of the most
beneficial of tropical birds for they feed almost entirely on obnoxious
insects. In Europe I believe they do sometimes poach on the apiaries,
but not to a great extent. For grace of form and beauty these birds are
rivalled by few ; they are very homogeneous in form, but their colours
are exceedingly diverse, some of the African forms being amazingly
coloured.

The London Zoo has recently received from the Moscow Zoo some
specimens of this Goose. It is very interesting as specimens are rarely
seen in this country, though they have been known to come here as
stragglers.
This bird is one of the most beautiful coloured birds in existence,
its pigmentation is black with white local patches, rump, sides, and
belly ; the ear-coverts, foreneck and chest are chestnut, outlined by
white, and the two wing-bands are grey. The sexes are similar,
though the female is a little smaller than the male. It has a hoarse
croaking voice. The colour of the egg is creamy white, with obscure
traces of an underlying green shell, the surface is rather smooth and
not glossy, and the shell is fragile. It appears to be a late breeder. Its
habitat is West Siberia.
This bird has been known to visit every country of Europe except
Spain. Also it has been portrayed in the paintings of Egypt.

As a direct result of having our journal translated into the French
language and distributed in France and Belgium, we have enrolled over
sixty new members. We consider our action has been fully justified by
such a satisfactory increase in our membership. We have now some 400
members, and we can truthfully say that almost every country in the
world is represented. We have found that our members abroad take
a great deal more interest in our activities than our British associates ;
this, while being hard to understand, is nevertheless in many ways
satisfactory. I think perhaps the reason for this apparent lack of interest
lies in the fact that these members are kept in close contact with our
doings through the reading of Cage Birds week by week. This may be
denied to our members in other countries, especially those who do not
speak the English language. The keeping of ornamental Pheasants is
spreading rapidly in Scotland, and perhaps this is partly due to the

from Northern Ireland ; now we are receiving applications for member-

lovers with a few exceptions, Mr. Edwards, of North Wales, being a
very keen member. Belgium and France need little mention, these
countries being always to the forefront with many Pheasant lovers.
Germany is disappointing, but in these times this is not difficult to
understand. There are some ardent phasianists in the Middle States,
and mention might be made of Paul Schmidt of Yugo-Slavia. Italy
is badly represented with the notable exception of Professor Ghigi.
We have many members in the U.S.A., where the fancy has made
remarkable strides in the last few years.
We want more phasianists in Great Britain who will keep and
cause to propagate the rarer species, quite 90 per cent of our members
content themselves with keeping and rearing the popular four species,
Silvers, Goldens, Beeves, and Amhersts, all of which are well established.
This is a great pity, but now we have a great and ambitious aviculturist,
whose name perhaps I must not mention, who will go far to make up
for the deficiencies of others. I am convinced that time will prove
I am right.

By E. Valentine
With further reference to my note in the September Magazine
I am glad to say the four young birds then mentioned are now safely
reared and wholly independent of their parents. I have not heard of
this species being bred up to now and am hoping to be the first to do so.
My first acquaintance with this species was on 27th April, when I
received a telegram from Mr. John Frostick, saying he was sending a
pair of Goodfellows' Blue-headed Parrot Finches next day.

E. Valentine--Breeding of Goodfellows Blue-headed Parrot Finch 327
On the morning of the 29th they duly arrived, and needless to say
I was delighted with them.
I kept them in a cage indoors until 27th May, when the weather
became warmer.
Within a week they began to show signs of nesting, as did several
other birds which shared their aviary.
Unfortunately the weather again became very cold and wet and
all inclinations of nesting appeared to be put aside.
Towards the end of June conditions became more favourable and
I noticed the Parrot Finches busy with nesting materials. Meanwhile,
they had turned very wild and shy.
By the way, the nest when found later, consisted entirely of soft
hay.
For nearly three weeks I was never able to catch sight of the hen,
and saw very little of her mate during that time.
On Saturday, 31st July, I first suspected there might be young as
both the old birds were busy with the insectivorous food, and were
taking live ants' eggs into the shelter. This went on all the next week
until Friday (6th August), when I discovered two young ones on the
grass plot in the open part of the aviary.
One of these birds was bigger than the other and appeared to be
perfectly feathered, the other had a bare tract from the throat down
to the abdomen.
Both birds showed the light (electric) blue ornamentations at each
side of the gape, as in young Oouldians.
After looking round, I discovered two more perching fairly high up.
Again one was much the larger bird, perfectly feathered, the other
the bare tract as in the case before mentioned.
In each case the beak was a feature, and appeared very substantial,
the upper mandible being dark in colour, the lower bright yellow.
The general colour was dull green when compared with the parents.
On Sunday, 9th, I noticed the bare tracts were completely covered,
and the ornamentations rapidly fading away. In a day or so these had
disappeared.
The yellow gapes were very prominent for some weeks, but now they
are dark just as in the parents.

328 E. Valentine--Breeding of Goodfellows Blue-headed Parrot Finch
To-day (16th September), there is very little trace of blue on the
head, the general colour is still dull, the red in the tail is still rusty,
the same applies to the tail-coverts.
The tails are much shorter than those of the old birds.
From first they left the nest, until a fortnight ago I had to drive the
young birds into the shelter each night. During the day they passed
much of their time indoors, but always selected the most exposed part
of the aviary in which to roost.
The weather during August was fine and warm and the youngsters
went on famously, never giving me any cause for anxiety.
I was able to get a good supply of live ants' eggs and wasp grub,
of which they are extremely fond.
Until the youngsters had become well established I never really
looked for the nest they had been hatched in, and for a long time thought
a parrakeet box had been used, now I find a wooden Keston Finch nest
had been the one selected.
In passing, I may say I find these most useful, but cannot under-
stand why my birds do not take to the wire ones. They appear to
think they are only receptacles for nesting materials and empty same as
quickly as possible.
I am afraid these rambling notes are far too long, and tiresome,
so I must bring them to a close.
In doing so, I must say my Goodfellows have provided me with
an interesting and pleasing experience.

Madam, --I have read Dr. Sprawson's notes on his successes during the
years 1936 and 1937 with great interest. I have every respect for his knowledge
on Pheasant keeping, as I am well aware of the fact that he is an experienced
and most thorough fancier, but I must always draw my sword (in this case
my pen !) when I read disparaging remarks about the marvellous Lady
Amherst Pheasant. Surely Dr. Sprawson must have an exceptionally ferocious
male bird ? I have kept hundreds of these birds and it is very rare to find such
a bully as Dr. Sprawson tells us about. I have in my mind at this moment eight
distinguished phasianists, all of whom regularly rear Amhersts and I seldom

hear them complain of the cocks maiming or killing their hens, although I will
admit that occasionally they will bully them. I have written to Dr. Sprawson
and suggested he should part with his unamiable Amherst cock and try another
in its place. Now I willingly admit that Amhersts that have a streak of Golden
blood are terribly vicious, and most undesirable birds, but such birds are not
Lady Amhersts. Finally there is one sure method of preventing any Pheasant
cocks from seriously damaging a hen. I have informed Dr. Sprawson of this
method and shall be pleased to give similar information to anyone interested.
[Please publish it. --Ed.] Think of me what you will, " injure me as you will,"
but if you calumniate that gorgeous Pheasant, the Lady Amherst, then be
prepared to cross swords with its greatest lover. One of the most beautiful
birds in the world and most adaptable to aviary life, no aviculturist should be
without specimens. At the moment I have four Amherst cocks in one aviary
and what a banquet of beauty they provide, what a feast of dignified
aristocratic grace ! Ungallant and cruel to their hens ? Oh, surely no !--
P. J. Lambert.

AMERICAN CRANES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996315576923077" page_id="56322231"  page_num="329" year="" vol="">
Madam, --The account in the June Magazine of the nesting of Mr. Lewis's
Sandhills was most interesting, for there seems to be no record of such a
happening in confinement in this country. It is a great pity that no young
were reared, but with a proven breeding pair, one always hopes for success
in a following season.
Of North America's three Cranes, the Sandhill (Grus mexicana) and its
smaller but closely related cousin, the Little Brown Crane ( G . canadensis)
are still quite abundant in the wild state, and as they are now well protected
against market hunters who have accounted for the diminution of so many
of our American birds, one can expect the two varieties to become more
abundant. Cranes are, however, rather difficult to trap, or at least more
so than other types of birds, and consequently such specimens as are offered
are more likely than not to be wing-tipped or more or less crippled birds
so that subsequent nesting in confinement is rather improbable. With all
due regard for some of our excellent American aviculturists, one must admit
that over here we have been inclined to spend our time on foreign species
of birds, many times to the detriment of our good American varieties. This
has been the case with our native Cranes so that I feel Mr. Lewis's achievement
in getting his Sandhills to nest is not paralleled in American aviculture.
Had American aviculturists taken an interest in propagating our lovely
American Whooping Crane (G. americana ) in the past, it might not now
be at the point of extinction. The Japanese have given us an example of
what can be done with Cranes in the numbers of Manchurian Cranes which
they manage to rear. I hope that another year will see Mr. Lewis rearing
to maturity young of the lovely Sandhills.
C. L. Sibley.

Madam,--I send you two items for publication in the Avicultural
Magazine : one an obituary notice concerning our late member, Mr. A. E,
Henley, Hauraki Street, Birkenhead, Auckland. Mr. Henley recently passed
away after a short, painful illness. The Avicultural Society of New Zealand,
and, indeed, the whole of the bird fancy in this country, owe a very deep
debt of gratitude to our late member.
He passed away at a comparatively early age and at his death was a
member of the Avicultural Society of New Zealand and of the Board of
Managers. During the whole of his lifetime he has been associated with
birds of all descriptions and, although at one time his activities included
Canaries, in recent years he has specialized in foreign birds, principally of
the more difficult soft-billed type. He had good successes as a breeder,
securing many certificates from the Society for the first breeding of species
in New Zealand. He was particularly successful with Spreo Starlings and
with Dhyal birds, and had many successes with Australian Finches.
His aviaries at Birkenhead were exceedingly extensive, probably the
largest private collection in New Zealand. The aviaries and surroundings
were a delight to the eye, for Mr. Henley combined the activities of an
aviculturist with those of an ardent amateur gardener, and his collection of
ferns, orchids, and cacti was exceedingly well known in this city. He did
not keep his treasures to himself, but both he and his wife were most hospitable
in inviting individuals and also members of various bird clubs and other
organizations to come to his place, view his wonderful surroundings and
partake of his hospitality. The gap left by our friend can never be filled,
for he was a pillar of strength, not only to the Avicultural Society, but also
to the various cage bird clubs of which he had been, at various times, an
office-bearer.
When in the past importations of birds have been made for distribution
amongst members, Mr. Henley was one who was always only too willing
to come along and give of his time and experience in sorting, caging, and
feeding the new arrivals. In all matters appertaining to birds, Mr. Henley
was generous to a fault, always agreeable to help a fellow member out of
a difficulty, to lend him birds to make up pairs and to pass on those benefits
of his thirty-odd years of experience in the keeping of birds. His memory
will ever remain with us, particularly with those with whom he worked so
hard in the establishment of the Society. He is survived by his widow,
two sons, and a daughter, and to them we offer our most sincere and heartfelt
sympathy.
G. Rowland Hutchinson.

NESTING HABITS OF THE RED-FACED LOVEBIRD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995613142857143" page_id="56322232"  page_num="330" year="" vol="">
Madam,-- In the May, 1937, issue of the Avicultural Magazine is a most
interesting article by Mr. H. Hampe, of Brunswick, on the nesting habits
of Agatornis pullaria. Our late member, Mr. A. E. Henley, who has recently
passed away, had a pair of these Red-faced Lovebirds in one of his aviaries.
They had been there for approximately two years before any sign of nesting
took place. Considering that, owing to their habits in a state of freedom,
they might prefer to burrow into a nesting site, our late member suspended

in the aviary a piece of pnnga log, better known perhaps as a piece of tree-
fern stem. This New Zealand punga has a hard core of approximately 2 inches
diameter with, inside of it, a pity centre. Surrounding the hard core to
a diameter varying from 9 to 12 inches is mass of wiry, brown fibre, very
closely matted together, which forms the trunk of the tree-fern, or punga,
when growing. A length of this stem, about 3 feet, was suspended
horizontally in the aviary and there was a slight flaw in the material on
the underneath side of the log.
During the breeding season of 1936, the hen Red-faced commenced to
excavate with her beak a tunnel through the fibrous growth. She continued
doing this, working upwards and towards one end of the log, where she
formed a nesting site. The diameter of the tunnel was approximately
If inches, the same as the tunnel described by our member, Mr. Hampe.
Mr. Henley, however, did not provide any nesting material, and possibly
this omission accounted for his final lack of success.
Several eggs were laid and apparently incubated for a short period, but
were then ejected from the nest and found by Mr. Henley on the floor of
the aviary. This coming season another member will have the opportunity
of experimenting with these birds and, having previous experience to guide
him, the prospects of success should be brighter.
It is apparent, however, from the two experiences recorded that a really
hard material in which to make the nest is not necessary. The ideal material
seems to be one which can retain a rigid form after being cut away by the
beak of the hen, and it seems that several thicknesses of punga logs, their
ends buried in the soil and in length about 4 feet, would provide an ideal
nesting site, particularly if a small tunnel were started in a suitable position
to give a little encouragement when starting operations.
G. Rowland Hutchinson.
(Hon. Secretary and Treasurer, Avicultural Society of New Zealand.)
Mrs. Drake, My lor, Falmouth writes: Two young violet-eared Waxbills
left the nest on the 17th October. They did not have a single live ant's egg,
were reared entirely on spray millet and mealworms. The nest was in the
same bush as last year. The new hen only arrived the end of July ! Aren't
they wonderful !

Miss Dovaston, are new to aviculture. They were imported from
Sumatra by Mr. Frost in the early part of 1936. They are about the
size of a Shama with an equally long tail which is barred with white
on the underside.
Early last year I gave two of these Sibias an aviary to themselves,
and w&apos;as fortunate enough to find that they were a true pair as there
is no apparent sex difference. A nest was built in the fork of a tree
in which two blue eggs, similar in size to those of a Blackbird, were
laid. After sixteen days the young were hatched and were well cared
for by the parents.
Unfortunately, three days later, I decided to try the same experi-
ment with the Grey Sibias as had been so successful with the Black-
headed, and allowed them liberty. The second night after, the cock
forsook the aviary and disappeared.
At the same time, a pair of Black-headed Sibias were rearing young
in a neighbouring garden. These birds took great interest in the nest
of the Grey Sibias, having been bred in the same aviary, and, in fact,

fed the young continuously. Sibias, however, are inclined to fight
amongst themselves and the hen Grey would probably have been
killed had the Black-headed not been shut out of the aviary.
I feel convinced that had the hen Grey been caught up the young
would have been reared quite satisfactorily by the Black-headed, but
the Grey alone failed to bring the young off the nest.
These birds are very fond of fruit, particularly apples, and appear
to be equally hardy as their Black-headed cousins. Like these, they
are very quick in their movements and make excellent and attractive

The breeding season just ended has been a rather moderate one,
some quite nice birds being reared but nothing very new or striking.
X , the evil spirit who specializes in blasting the fondest hopes of avicul-
turalists, was, as usual, well to the fore and on every occasion which
afforded real scope to his inventive genius for destruction or misplaced
humour, he did not fail to rise to the opportunity !
As the aviaries were being moved and re-erected all through the
late winter, spring, and early summer, the birds were subjected to a
good deal of disturbance and it was really wonderful how few were
put off nesting altogether. In the few cases where former breeding
pairs did not lay it was usually when they had had to be moved
to a fresh aviary after their arrival at Haywards Heath, the second
short move proving, apparently, far more disturbing than the first
complete change of district.
The weather on the whole was fairly good. Some very cold north-
west winds produced a fair number of cases of egg-binding, but there
was a commendable absence of the usual hard frost and snow in April and
of the spell of arctic weather characteristic of the second week in May.
The stock of Indian Ringnecks consisted of two lutino hens (sisters)
bred by myself about four years ago and mated to a lutino-bred cock

and an ordinary cock respectively. The father of these hens, a scrubby,
undersized, and now somewhat aged bird bred in a small fixed aviary
and addicted to the vice of child-murder, was mated to a newly-acquired
common green hen. A two-year-old son of the lutino hen mated to the
ordinary cock, was paired to a wild lutino hen and a 1936 brother or sister
of the two-year-old, for a time occupied an aviary with another wild
lutino hen. The latter for nearly a year had suffered from a swelling
and discharge under the eyes which, strange to say, did not seem to
affect her general health at all, though it did not yield to treatment.
The lutino hen paired to the adult lutino-bred cock had nested as a
two-year-old but got egg-bound and refused to sit. For two seasons I
tried to induce her to breed after the warm weather had come but
instead she only dropped into moult. This year I gave her her nest
in April and she took to it fairly quickly, and, as her brood should have
contained a good percentage of yellows, X decided to have some fun
with her at my expense. After producing one curiously elongated and
misshapen egg she proceeded to get egg-bound and had to be brought
into the hospital. She remained there quite a week without anything
happening and, as she seemed fit and well, I at last concluded that she
was not going to lay her egg at all but had decided to " re-absorb " it,
an extraordinary feat of which even egg-bound hens are occasionally
capable (I have known two instances). I therefore put her back in
the aviary. She paired with the cock almost immediately ; went into
her nest; came out again ; looked about for one of the few places where
the wire-netting on the floor of the flight was not covered by grass ;
took a careful aim and laid a good normal egg from the perch on to
this hard wire with the natural result that it broke in half! She then
took to her nest after a fashion but for a long time sat so nervously
and unsteadily that I dared not look to see whether she had laid again
for fear of making her desert altogether. When, however, I judged that
the period of incubation--a little over three weeks--was fully up
I did have a look at the nest and found, as I feared, only the original
misshapen egg. Believing that ill-favoured wight who once asserted
that badly-shaped eggs never hatch, I took it out and held it up to the
light. To my surprise it was dark, not clear. " Addled, of course,"
whispered A. " Why let the hen waste time over a thing like that ?

If you get rid of it she may lay again." So I broke the egg, which con-
tained a living chick due to hatch in a day or two ! Owing to the hen's
unsteady sitting during the early days, the period of incubation was not
up as I thought. X went off chuckling and duly finished the episode
by inducing the bereaved mother to start behaving for some time as if
she meant to lay again, only in the end to do nothing but moult !
The other lutino sister paired to the normal cock likewise got
egg-bound but sat all right when returned to the aviary, hatching three
out of four eggs and rearing three good greens, two of which, however,
unfortunately died in the autumn.
The two-year-old son of this hen, paired to the wild lutino, provided
one of the best results of the season--two very nice lutinos and a green.
I am hoping that one of the young yellows may prove to be a cock as it
seems to have rather a darker iris than its companion.
The green hen paired to the old and scrubby lutino-bred cock
also got egg-bound but sat steadily. She hatched two eggs, one of her
own and one of a Crimson-wing, but reared neither young one. I do
not think she fed the Crimson-wing on account of its white down,
and her own young one, which may have been weakly, only survived a
short time.
The last of the lutino hens, which did well for a time in an aviary,
ultimately developed a recrudescence of the swelling and discharge be-
low the eye. I sent her to the Veterinary College, where the trouble was
diagnosed as tubercular and she was ultimately destroyed. I have never
known a bird to suffer so long from a local tubercular infection without
the slightest injury to its general health or a spreading of the disease
throughout the system. The lutino was already infected when I first
received her from India more than a year ago. The disease fortunately
was not transmitted to her companion, the 1936 lutino-bred, who
remains perfectly well.
Plumheads were a complete failure. They are, in my experience,
the hardest of all Parrakeets to rear to healthy maturity and others
have had a similar bad luck with them.
A green hen bred from lutinistic parents and paired to a normal
cock hatched three young but lost one after a few days. The remainder
succumbed some time later, but may have been killed by black ants which

were found in the nest with the skeletons of the dead chicks. Though
not, I suppose, to be compared with its tropical relatives for destruc-
tiveness, the common small black ant is, as I know from previous
experience, well able to kill nestling birds as well as young tree-frogs.
It is the same ill-conditioned little brute which, with misplaced agricul-
tural zeal, farms green-fly on one's best rose trees !
The remaining two pairs of Plumheads are lutinistic. One pair had
clear eggs, the same as last year. The other pair produced four rickety
young ones, one of which injured its head soon after leaving the nest,
while the other three were killed later by a stoat which found a hole
in the wire netting of the floor. The giving of Virol-soaked spray millet
proved a failure as far as the stamina of the young was concerned,
although the parents ate it quite freely. One rather interesting feature
of lutinistic Plumheads is that the plumage is not always constant from
moult to moult. One pied cock is much yellower this autumn than he
was before, while a yellowish hen is, on the contrary, much greener.
A hen Plumhead paired to a cock Slaty-head reared three good
young. Their young one of last year wintered successfully in an out-
door aviary. As often happens, the hybrids appear more robust than
the pure species.
One pair of Malabars w r ere upset by a double move and did not settle
down to nesting. The cock also has a habit of going out of breeding con-
dition just as the weather is getting warm enough for the hen to have some
chance of laying safely. The species is exceedingly liable to egg-binding.
The second pair reared two good young, their third fertile egg
being damaged.
My old breeding pair of Layards were also upset by a double move
and did not nest, though they got as far as pairing.
The other couple, consisting of an imported cock and a two-year-old
hen bred by myself, reared two very fine young ones in a grandfather-
clock nest. The cock ate a lot of bread and milk and spray millet. One
good point about Layards is that, although liable to egg-binding,
you can keep them back from breeding until the warm nights have
arrived in June without fear of their going early into moult.
Derbyan Parrakeets reared three fine youngsters in a natural tree-
trunk. The hen has a curious habit, immediately after pairing wdth the

cock, of hurling herself into the nest as though projected from a catapult,
apparently believing that an egg will arrive immediately! She does
this even when not very near laying and not as yet spending much
time in the log.
My efforts to breed rare Conures gave X a lot of amusement without
even putting him to the necessity of taking drastic action on the
birds' lives.
I had, as I believed, a pair of Queen of Bavarias. The hen had
produced young two years ago, but these were killed by the cock and I
obtained another one to replace the murderer. They duly went to
nest in the middle of the summer and, although the cock spent more
time in the nest than his predecessors had done and was not seen to
feed the hen, I did not think much of it as I had read that it is usual for
both sexes of other species of Conures to spend much time together in
their home. Inspection of the nest after about ten days revealed two
sound eggs and one broken one. The accident to the latter was no
doubt due to the fact that both birds are very tame and on hearing
anyone near they rush out to yell at him, afterwards bundling down the
nest together like a sack of coals. The weeks went by and my hopes
rose as the couple sat more tightly for the hen previously had not been
in the habit of sitting over-time on clear eggs. Finally, we had a look.
No young but four eggs ! I looked at the " cock " very closely and the
more I did so the less masculine did " he " appear ! Then the truth
dawned on me : my " pair " are two hens and the chance of my getting
a cock in these days is indeed remote !
Now for the Bed-breasted Conures, one of the rarest and loveliest of
the genus and possessed into the bargain of quite innocuous voices. I
had had three birds for about a couple of years but was a little puzzled
as to their sex. One of the trio, though resembling the others in head
conformation, was rather different in colour from the other two, was
bolder and more aggressive, and in 1936 was frequently seen to pair with
its companions. On the other hand, it rather puzzled us by doing most
of the incubation of the one egg that was laid and which proved infertile.
I decided this year to break up the Triple Entente when the breeding
season arrived as, although the three Conures were good friends, their
habit of roosting all together did not seem very conducive to the safety

of the eggs. I also had the great good fortune in early summer to obtain
the loan of a cock from Mr. Whitley. When the new bird arrived I
was at once struck by the heavier and more masculine appearance of
his head, but as my cock and the best hen were continually pairing it
seemed a pity to upset them and I gave the new-comer the other and
less good bird. They soon became friendly but got no further than
examining the nest. The other pair in due course vanished into their
log and later inspection revealed five eggs. Time passed and the
date arrived by which young should have appeared : we examined
the nest and found both birds sitting hopefully on fourteen clear eggs !
In spite of his determination to play the part of the sterner sex the
" cock 55 had forgotten " himself" at the last moment and vied with " his "
partner in the production of a really fine clutch. " He " was a hen all
the time ! I put " his " companion with the real cock and hen No. 3
with " him ", but it was too late. A second attempt at nesting was not
made and I shall have to wait until 1938. It is reported that A, in con-
versation with his senior partner Old Nick, was overheard to say that
the writer creeping carefully round the aviaries of the four incubating
hen Conures in fear lest they should be disturbed and let the precious
eggs get cold was the pleasantest thing he had seen for many a long day !
Broadtailed Parrakeets did only moderately this year and some
of the more nervous pairs were upset by the late move. The old breeding
pair of Adelaides were a long time in settling down and the hen broke
one or two eggs or dropped them from the perch. She did finally start
to sit on seven eggs, and the young lived to leave the nest but were
not a very creditable family as only three were able to fly properly and
the rest, though well grown, were mildly rickety, probably because their
moulting parents had not fed them too well. One of the good young
ones and one of the weakly ones succumbed to septicaemia and another
of the latter to inflammation of the lungs; the remaining two less good
specimens improved steadily, as is usual in such cases, and when
able to perch and fly were given away. A second pair of Adelaides bred
two years ago at Peasmarsh and more intractably wild than any
imported specimens were too upset by their new quarters and did
not lay.
Pennant's did well, rearing six fine young ones. The hen's breeding

record is a variable one, as the first year I had her she reared a good
strong brood and the two subsequent seasons, under precisely similar
conditions, lost most of her young from rickets or disease. The improve-
ment this season may be due to the fact that she had a new mate and
also that she took a certain amount of bread and milk when rearing her
family.
The hen Stanley, who reared a good brood single-handed last season,
lost her young in the nest. I think this may have been my fault, as
her last year's success was in a grandfather-clock box and this season I
only provided her with a natural tree-trunk and a wooden-bottomed
box. Both of these she obviously held in very low esteem and only
took to the box reluctantly after a lot of delay.
The cock Yellow-rumped Parrakeet was very anxicus to nest,
but his mate, a nervous bird, was upset by the move and a new nest-
box and did not properly settle down. The hen Yellow-bellied Parrakeet
laid three eggs but would not sit. She is a very old bird and probably
her breeding career is finished.
Brown's indulged in their usual maddening habit of moulting twice
and &apos;wasting the summer, but the failure of one hen to breed may
have been partly due to the fact that she did not approve of her
companion. She had nested with me some years ago when paired to a
different cock, and laid early this autumn when given a fresh mate at
Keston but she died soon after.
The cock of the second pair, who had done everything in his power,
earlier, to induce the hen to nest, amused me very much, one day, when
both were moulting, by going right inside the nest-box himself--a most
unusual proceeding for a cock Broadtail unless he has young to feed.
I think he must have said to his wife, " Since you seem quite incapable
of producing an egg, I am going to try " ; anyhow, his facetiousness
made her very angry, and she rushed to the entrance of the nest and
fought him through the hole, afterwards going inside, where the
scrimmage was continued. Pinally she got the worst of it, and had
to retreat, and a few r moments later he came out and hopped about
with his tail spread, obviously delighted at the success of his effort
to get a rise out of her !
The old pair of Yellow-mantled Rosellas reared nine good young

in two broods, two of the first brood, however, falling victims of
septicaemia.
One pair of Mealy Kosellas hatched two young, but just before
they left the nest the cock attacked the hen and inflicted a deep bite
on her wing, which turned septic and took weeks to heal. In spite
of an injury which would have incapacitated any ordinary bird the
hen stuck nobly to her task and reared her family. Her ill-couditioned
husband for a time I fully determined should end his days in a
Parrakeet's Hell, i.e. a Zoo where Broadtails are permanently confined
in cages, fed on nothing but hemp, oats, and sunflower, and allowed
no fruit, green food, nor baths. However, knowing of an aviculturalist
who was very anxious to obtain a cock Mealy at a low figure, I offered
him the criminal, together with a description of his ill-deeds. It is
superfluous to add that the wretch at once reared a family with his
new mate, I was going to say, " like an angel," or " like a lamb ", but
as neither of these beings is, I suppose, conspicuous for paternal and
conjugal devotion, perhaps I should say " like a Bengalese " !
The hen Mealy of the other pair got badly egg-bound with her fifth
egg, and had to be kept in hospital nearly a week. In spite of the fact
that she appeared to have been sitting for some days w T hen J took her
in, and was slow in settling down when returned to the aviary, all the
eggs hatched and five good youngsters were reared. Last year the cock
of this pair murdered one of his offspring without warning. I felt
sure he would repeat the offence, but in keeping with the general
contrariety of birds, he just didn't !
The breeding pair of Kings reared three good youngsters, but
although the hens of two other pairs both came into breeding condition,
the cocks with them, which were barely adult, took little interest in
them and no eggs were laid.
The breeding pair of Crimson-wings, which failed to rear their young
last year, brought up two exceptionally fine young ones. The hen eats
bread and milk freely, and, I think, wdth benefit to her offspring.
A second pair consisted of a new imported cock and a very miserable-
looking hen who was said to have been caged before she came to me.
She certainly looked like it as her plumage was so worn that she could
not fly properly. I never thought she would breed, but she went into

the tree-trunk nest as soon as it was put up in the aviary and for a
time all seemed to be going well. A few days later, however, it was
apparent that she was contemplating laying in the shelter, but by
shutting her out day and night I succeeded in forcing her to go back
to the tree-trunk. Four quite good young left the nest in due course,
but two subsequently fell victims to paratyphoid.
The third pair consisted of an old breeding cock and a hen acquired
about two years previously who had shown herself possessed of the
most marked antipathy to anything resembling a nest. For her special
benefit I reconstructed the aviary shelter so that it was little more
than a partly open-fronted shed in the corner of which she could lay
on the ground if she liked with a reasonable chance of her young getting
all the fresh air and natural moisture that immature Crimson-wings
require. The shelter, however, was not to her liking, and she deposited
her eggs on some wire netting on the floor of the front corner of the
flight. To this corner (much to her disgust, as it obstructed the view
she appeared to enjoy when incubating) we added some protection
at the sides and overhead, but it was of no avail, as the few eggs she
did not succeed in breaking proved to be addled.
A little later, however, she laid again, this time right in the middle
of the flight, where only some overhead shelter could be provided to
keep off the worst of the direct rain. She got very wet at times, but
did not appear to mind, and as all the wire netting she loved to place
her eggs on had been covered up, the clutch of three hatched and the
young did well for some time. Long before they were fledged, however,
they began to wander about, and to protect them from getting drowned
my aviary attendant confined them in an open-topped bottomless box
in a sheltered corner of the aviary. For some reason this treatment
did not appear to suit them. One did all right, but the other two,
which up to that time had been most robust, developed bad rickets in
their legs as soon as they began to feather. I gave them complete
liberty in the aviary, and in time they made a fair recovery, and were
good enough to dispose of as pets.
A pair of Rock Peplars came into breeding condition unusually
early--or rather the hen did, for the cock does not seem to possess a
very robust constitution. After some delay due to the cock's temporary

illness the hen laid. Almost up to the last moment I never expected
the eggs to be fertile as the cock, though interested enough in the
nest, absolutely refused to feed the hen or pair with her. At the very
last moment, however, he relented, being apparently determined to
do his duty when need arose, but to waste no superfluous energy.
Anyhow, from the time the first egg was laid he started to feed the hen
assiduously, and she, for her part, had her revenge on him
for his early neglect, for she hardly left the nest at all until
the young were almost fully fledged ! I do not think the cock
would have survived the heavy strain imposed on him had he not
proved very fond of bread and milk and cooked beef fat. Two lovely
youngsters left the nest, and for a day or two, after the first emerged,
the cock would not allow the hen to go anywhere near it. Apparently
he feared she might get some of the credit for what he not unjustly
felt was his own achievement !
The hen Bock Peplar had had such an easy time of it that she
proceeded to lay a second clutch of eggs--a most unusual proceeding
for this single-brooded species. However, she did not sit, either
because she felt that her long-suffering husband should not be tried
too hard, or because he made it plain that he was not going to do any
more ! The subsequent history of the family was rather sad, both
youngsters when fully reared dying of the common scourge of young
Parrakeets--septicaemia.
For the past two years an unmated cock Barraband had occupied
an aviary with a hen King, and I decided to let them breed. Five eggs
were laid in a natural tree-trunk, and four hybrids were hatched and
reared, one, though free from rickets, being less well grown than the
others. The young birds are green with some red round the thighs,
and some pink on the under-surface of the tail. In shape they are
intermediate between their parents and very graceful, and when fully
adult should be birds of great beauty also (a great merit in hybrids),
infertile ! Like most hybrids they are good linguists, and it is amusing
to hear one of the two I have kept talking Barraband, like his father,
while his brother replies in his mother's tongue !

aviary to themselves, and in the second aviary containing an adult cock
and hen and two 1936 cocks and a hen three and two young were reared
respectively by the two females. One of the youngsters in this aviary
was a particularly lovely specimen showing red flecks on his breast
even in nestling plumage and being so steady that he would eat bits
of bread and milk offered him by hand through the wire netting. Seven
beautiful young Swifts reared without loss or trouble proved, however,
grievous to the soul of X, and he proceeded to see what he could do
about it. One of the two young reared by the single pair he afflicted
with a mysterious disease which caused her to lose the use of her wings
and later, to some extent also, of her feet. Swifts, however, often put
up a good fight against illness, and the little hen eventually made a
slow but complete recovery. X then returned to the charge, and
successfully polished off two young from the other aviary by chill
and gastritis, one of the victims, of course, being the tame and lovely
young cock I was expecting to grow into my finest stock bird.
Cockatoos were a complete failure. The Leadbeaters, which
reared two beautiful young last season, had two rickety young this
year, one of which had eventually to be destroyed, while the other
was given away as a pet. It is possible I did not thrown down enough
seed on the ground in the outside flight as the old birds seemed to feed
almost entirely on this germinating seed, and ate very little dry seed
from their dish in the shelter.
I obtained the loan of a cock for my single hen Gang-gang, but he
was in very poor condition from long confinement, too wung stiff to
fly, and much plucked. They got as far as pairing and entering the
nest, but no eggs were laid. I find Gang-gangs very fond of bread
and milk, and also of cooked beef fat, of which they receive a small
piece twnce a week. Hemp seed is extremely bad for them.
The Palm Cockatoo's aviary was not finished until late in the
summer, and as the cock Banksian had escaped during the winter
and was never heard of again, Mrs. Anningson's fine hen, now the
oldest bird in my collection, had no chance of repeating her many
efforts to propagate her kind.
With White Boseates no progress was made. I started the season
with a white cock paired to an albino hen ; an albino cock paired to a

normal hen ; a white-bred grey cock paired to his sister, and a white-
bred grey cock paired to bis grey mother.
The White couple took a lot of interest in their nest, but did not lay.
The albino cock and normal hen were about to breed when X felt
that something must be done or the first White Eoseate to be reared
in captivity might make its appearance. It is not easy to give an
illness to a robust Eoseate in breeding condition, so X was driven
to his last resource when dealing with tough birds safely housed--he
put his head into the shelter and grinned at her when she was at roost
one night, and next morning I found her dead on the floor--of heart
failure !
The cock of the brother and sister White-bred couple had been
guilty of egg-eating at Keston a few&apos; years ago. This summer he
repeated the offence, and the only egg we rescued and placed under
a Pennant failed to hatch.
The White-bred cock and his mother produced two young w ? hich
died at an early age, w 7 hy, I cannot say unless the parents are too
nearly related.
Parrots, also, are mainly a tale of woe or disappointment.
I had two pairs of Eacket-tails, one which had had clear eggs two
years ago, the others being younger. The young couple did not lay
though they got as far as mating and going into the nest. The old pair
not only laid but hatched a young one. I knew from the first that X
would make this treasure the subject of his special attention and it
came as no surprise to me when after a few weeks it died in spite of its
parents' care. But more was to come. The old birds prepared to nest
again. This maddened X ; nothing, as other aviculturalists also may
have observed, makes him so furious as an unexpected attempt by a
pair of rare birds to defy him and repair the steps he has taken to
ensure a blank season. The hen Eacket-tail was on the point of laying
and the weather was all that could be desired when one morning after
breakfast I found the cock looking ill. He collapsed rapidly in hospital
and was dead by lunch time. I thought he might be suffering from
some unusual malady but it proved to be just ordinary enteritis.
My beautiful lutino Blue-fronted Amazon raises my hopes year
after year by going into the nest and sometimes even pairing, but no

eggs ever appear. This year I thought I would see what example would
do and put a pair of normal Amazons in the next aviary. The cock
I had had some time but the hen I bought out of a cage in a dealer's
shop. She was a depressed, scared-looking creature and so cramped
in spirit and body by long and close confinement that it was a long time
before she found her way in and out of the shelter and about the
aviary. I never dreamed of her breeding, but one day with no previous
warning she suddenly took to a grandfather-clock nest. Although
I knew the cock was friendly with her I never saw him pay her any
very special attention and when she was sitting he seemed far more
anxious to help to defend his neighbour's nest in the next aviary than
his own.
They were altogether an extraordinarily secretive couple, as the
hen was very rarely seen while incubating and it was a further surprise
when a young bird hatched, only to die a week or so later.
The efforts of the couple to fulfil their mission and set a good example
to the lutino were unfortunately lost upon her, for she seemed even
less inclined to serious nesting than before !
Incidentally the breeding of Blue-fronted Amazons is not to be
recommended to those who like to remain on friendly terms with their
birds. With the exception of one individual who was timid to the point
of being mental and could only gain normal reassurance if the members
of a Mothers' Union were paying a visit to the aviaries, each breeding
cock Blue-front I have had has developed a temper as suitable in a
domestic pet as that of a Jersey bull. He just makes one dive at the
first portion of the anatomy of any person entering the aviary and
hangs on quietly until the corpse is removed ! The lutino's present
mate is only one degree less offensive than his predecessor " Koko "
in that, whereas Koko went for me on sight on all occasions and minded
water as little as a duck, the other will retire if heavily baptized with
the water-can and usually allows me a close season from attack if
I renew the fruit and water once a day and after breakfast. He is
very definite on these points. " You may," he tells me, " put your
revolting paws into my place once a day to do necessary work ; but
I cannot stand them more than once and it must not be too early in
the morning. The sight of you first thing when I am just awake is

too much and until I have had my breakfast I cannot be expected to
control myself."
Grey Parrots are much more amenable. If a Grey likes you before
his or her marriage, the happy event is not likely to impair friendship.
Even if he doesn't, he won't go much out of his way to bite you so long
as you attempt no familiarities and don't put your fingers too temptingly
within reach.
I started with two pairs of Greys but with little hopes of successful
breeding. One old hen, formerly the pet of the late Canon Dutton,
had laid and incubated several clutches when unmated in past years
but had done nothing for three or four seasons and seemed very averse
to matrimony. She had shared an aviary with a cock since 1935, but
they had lived on terms of armed neutrality varied with occasional
squabbles over food in which the cock latterly proved the victor.
When they first came to me this spring they would sometimes meet and
look at one another in an earnest but critical fashion, uttering self-
conscious Kaffir clicks, and apparently saying, " I have tried hard to
see something likeable in you but somehow I just can't I." However,
perseverance is a great virtue, and Greys, even under the most favour-
able conditions, rarely if ever fall in love at first sight like Parrakeets
and Cockatoos. As the spring advanced the hen began to take more
interest in her nest than she had done for some time past, and although at
first she was inclined to try and drive the cock away when he too showed
interest in the proceedings she soon came to tolerate him and I saw
them performing what is apparently a courtship action in the species,
the couple first touching beaks and then making a rapid pumping
action with the head, which has nothing to do with regurgitation for
feeding. Eventually they were seen pairing and the hen laid, but
not long afterwards the eggs were all found broken and as the hen
had never destroyed her eggs when alone I concluded that the cock was
the culprit and gave him away--with some regret, as he was a fine
big bird and amiable in disposition. The cock of the other pair is less
good-tempered and will give you a nip if you allow him the opportunity,
although he will accept a peanut from the hand without a breach of
good behaviour. His mate I acquired last autumn. She was sold to
me at a high figure as a prolific layer of eggs and for a time I must admit

I felt that the vendor had " done " me as she was not only disfigured by
a deformed or damaged nostril, but until the summer was far advanced
showed not the slightest interest in her log. Her relations with the cock
were likewise not too friendly, for, while they occasionally did some
head-pumping, they more often disagreed over the food dish until he
eventually established his right to a first claim on all the delicacies.
In August, however, they became reconciled, like the other pair, and
eventually mated. Eggs were laid and one young bird was hatched but
after thriving for a time it unfortunately died, owing, I think, to its not
being rescued soon enough for hand-rearing after mid-October was past.
Yellow-fronted New Zealand Parrakeets unfortunately lived
up to the character they gained at Keston of being very free breeders
and equally free diers. I started the winter with three hens and a cock
which I kept caged in a warm bird-room. The cock died and in the
spring I gave the old hen to Mr. Partridge and exchanged one young
one for a cock with Mr. Sydney Porter. My pair went to nest soon after
the cock's arrival, but he caught a chill and died when his mate had
begun to sit. The widow, however, stuck to her task valiantly (much
to X's disgust) and reared four beautiful youngsters--three cocks and
a hen. Although her mother and sisters had been bad pluckers of their
young this hen did not possess the vice, possibly because I supplied
her with beef fat. Soon after leaving the nest the young female caught
a chill and died, to be followed several weeks later, to my sorrow,
by her devoted little mother. As he could not make her take any
ordinary disease, X played the same trick on her that he did on the hen
Roseate and she, too, succumbed to heart failure ! The three youngsters
I gave to Mr. Sydney Porter. Once X has really got his knife into a
species you may as well let the survivors go before he finishes his job !
Grass Parrakeets had little chance of doing anything as they were
new arrivals and their aviaries were not ready for them until late in
the season.
Mr. Harvey sent me a nice young cock Splendid for whom
Mr. Tebbitt kindly lent me a mate. X did not approve and she got a
slight chill but, as she recovered quickly and would not get anything
else, the night came when she went the same way as the Roseate and
the New Zealand.

Three new hen Kock Grass Parrakeets arrived, while a cock was
received from Keston. One of the hens died suddenly, with little
previous warning, from the complication of serious diseases which
often prove to be present in birds which almost up to the time of their
death look especially healthy !
Another hen got a chill in the autumn and died and the cock got
ill and has been caged for the winter. A third hen has been lent for
breeding.
A pair of Blue-winged Grass Parrakeets, bred by one of our
Continental members, were received from a foreign dealer. As his
premises are more than usually filthy the cock contracted eye disease
in one eye and so far the case has proved intractable even to perchloride
of mercury treatment that rarely fails.
My pair of Tahiti Blue Lories had to wait a long time before their
aviary was finished. These rare and interesting little birds are not
too easy to manage as many cocks are apt to turn savagely on their
hens with very little warning after living with them on apparently
affectionate terms and feeding them. I had to separate the couple
last winter on account of the cock's misbehaviour, and in June put
them into adjoining aviaries, the hen sharing her compartment with
a hen Blue-crowned Hanging Parrot whom she did not molest. Only
when she seemed thoroughly anxious for his company and he was
feeding her through the wire did I allow them together and so far
all has gone well--far better indeed than I ever expected, for when I
gave them a grandfather-clock nest in the shelter they soon took to it
and laid two eggs, taking, it is interesting to note, turns in sitting.
A youngster is now more than half reared.
The even rarer and more beautiful Goupil's Lory appears better-
tempered than its ally and we had no trouble with fighting at any
time. The hen of my pair is still very timid and rushes into her sleeping
box on the slightest alarm, and as she cannot fly too well owing to
cut wing feathers incompletely moulted I never dreamed she would
come into breeding condition. This, however, she did, not long after
the other Blues, but twice had trouble with a misshapen semi-softshelled
egg. I therefore separated her from her mate and hope that by next
year she will be in better fettle for nesting.

Lord Tavistock--Breeding Results for 1937
For a long time we had heartbreaking difficulties over the feeding
of the Coriphilus Lories--birds new to aviculture--and I had virtually
given them up in despair when my aviary attendant hit on the right
formula.
For several months both species did quite well on ordinary Lory
food--Dr. Allinson's prepared as for infants and sweetened, together
with ripe apple, pear, and grapes. Then they began to die of!--the
Goupils especially--from anaemia and it was evident that digestive
trouble was the cause. We tried everything we could think of--varia-
tions of Sunbird mixture, thin and normal--and still the casualties
went on. When the Goupils were reduced to four birds, one very ill
with the same complaint as the rest, I decided to present practically
all that I had left to Dr. Derscheid, who had had up till then better
luck than myself with the less uncommon species. It was just at this
moment we hit on the right food at last--it was Allinson's and fruit
all right, but Allinson's, when prepared as for other Lories, diluted
with its own volume of water ! On this mixture the sick Goupil recovered
and is the hen just referred to, and on it the other three birds I kept
have thriven. The Blues I sent to Dr. Derscheid have, I believe, done
well but the Goupil venture was disastrous, both being lost. This
account of the season's breeding may close with a reference to a few
new birds of interest. Four lutino Nyassa Lovebirds were received
from Australia. They are handsome in colour--a good yellow with
orange faces and tail bars, but they appear deficient in stamina and
liable to minor ailments and the strain will be hard to establish.
Six of the rare and striking Green-winged King Parrakeets were
obtained from Mr. Shaw Mayer--an adult cock and five immature birds,
four of which alas ! have moulted out males while the sixth I am not
too sure of either ! They appear robust, hardy birds like the Australian
species when not kept in cramped quarters and on stale ground. Their
call notes resemble the Australian King's but are weaker and higher
pitched. Mr. Shaw Mayer very kindly gave me a hen Princess Stephanie's
Bird of Paradise as a mate for my fine cock Rothschild's. The bird
was ill on arrival but soon recovered on a fresh air regime, with plenty
of mealworms and ripe pear. The Rothschild's, unfortunately, has
just died in the moult after being nearly six years in captivity.

VISIT TO PROFESSOR GHIGI, BOLOGNA
</sectionHeader>
<footnote confidence="0.613093142857143">
6th SEPTEMBER, 1937
By P. C. Mackie
My friend, that ardent " Phasianist " Mr. P. J. Lambert, mentioned
to me early this year that it would be interesting if I made
" Avicultural Notes " during my summer holiday abroad, and on
6th September it was my pleasure, in company with my wife, to visit
Professor Ghigi, of Bologna, Italy, for one, all too short, afternoon.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.996674222222222" page_id="56322261"  page_num="351" year="" vol="">
But were I to write of all my wife and I saw on this occasion, the notes
would indeed be more copious than even Mr. Lambert considered
reasonable.
I will omit a detailed description of our arrival in Bologna and our
endeavours to inform our Italian taxi-driver that we wished to visit
the Institute of Zoology of Bologna University, for the man had a laud-
able desire to show all the various institutes of this world-famous and
most ancient of 'varsities, and took us the round cf all its many depart-
ments before eventually leading us to where we desired. Still one
must appreciate his endeavours to interest us and his enthusiasm
for his city can have been his only interest for his final account was
less than Is. !
At the main building of the University we were escorted through
magnificent chambers to Professor Ghigi and were pleased to discover
that be speaks English exceedingly well--for few Italians do !
Professor Ghigi first showed us the imposing rooms and halls
of the University, and we were then driven by car to the Institute of
Zoology, where we spent a considerable time.
The inner courtyard was planted with shrubs and there were
numerous aviaries along the sides and fishponds with running water
near the centre. Running loose were several Reeve's, Silvers, etc.,
and also some extremely beautiful Vulturine Guinea-fowl, which the
wuiter energetically pursued amongst the shrubbery with his camera
in order to group them for a photograph. A somewhat lively Chukor
Partridge cleared the surrounding wall into the main highway and an
attendant was dispatched in pursuit. Ceylon Junglefowl were also
in evidence in this courtyard.

Professor Ghigi then showed us some Pheasants which he asked
us to sex and specify, and these turned out to be a Silver X Golden
cock, a Silver X Common cock, and a Silver X Golden hen which had
every appearance of being a cock--namely an intersexuatc. Professor
Ghigi has made a special study of the effects of crossing various species
of Pheasants, particularly Kaleege but also other gallinaceous birds,
and has made many most interesting discoveries. To give two

examples :---
(1) Silver X Golden.--The male hybrids favour the Silver
except in regard to shape of the markings, and an entirely different
result is obtained by crossing Golden x Silver, but, reverting back,
the female hybrids are invariably intersexuate with almost male
plumage.
(2) If a Pheasant is crossed with a more distantly related species
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.887328954545455" page_id="56322262"  page_num="352" year="" vol="">
or, as an extreme instance, a Common Fowd, it is highly improbable
that the female hybrid will develop at all, nearly all dying in the
slfell, so that all hybrids produced are therefore males.
Proceeding from the courtyard we were shown a most scientific
fish-breeding establishment and we were particularly interested in
Professor Ghigi's experiments in breeding Salamanders and crossing
black (the usual form) and albinistic specimens.
At the top of the building there was a fine gallery of aviaries con-
taining Pigeons and smaller foreign birds, Finches, Pastors, etc., whilst
leading into the courtyard before-mentioned were a group of semi-
subterranean aviaries (one of which accommodated the birds running
loose in the courtyard), which were delightfully cool in the extreme heat
we were experiencing.
Professor Ghigi showed us through magnificent laboratories and
lecture rooms, and indeed the writer wished he w T ere able to take a
course of Zoology or Biology to avail himself of these appointments.
After visiting taxidermical laboratories, dissecting rooms, and a new
museum in course of construction on three large floors (the writer noted
that one of the first exhibits was an Argus displaying to his hen, which
caused the remark that it was evident where Professor Ghigi's interests
lay), we were shown what must surely be the finest ornithological
library in Europe, and much difficulty was experienced in dragging

the writer away. But a room of greater interest was to follow--namely,
a room with the walls lined from floor to ceiling with large drawers
covered in glass, with each drawer labelled, viz.: " Crossoptilons "
--the drawer is opened and there are rows of stuffed Crossoptilons
showing the original Blue, Blue X Manchurian, 2nd cross, Blue X
Manchurian (almost as pure as the original Blue), and what a wealth
of material to show the effects of crossing various Kaleege : Kaleege X
Golden, generation after generation, hens indistinguishable from cocks
to this crossing, Beeves X Soemerings, showing two distinct types
of markings (particularly beautiful is this cross). " Etc.," said Professor
Ghigi--row upon row of unopened drawers and the writer had to be
again dragged away ! More drawers in another room with Butterflies
that Professor Ghigi had collected himself in South America--no
these notes could be far too copious surely !
With salutes and heel-clicking from attendants, we entered the car
and proceeded through the town up a beautiful hill-side to Professor
Ghigi's delightful residence, where Mrs. Ghigi received us and served
us with tea which was never more welcome.
Professor Ghigi's residence is one such as aviculturalists dream,
about--a beautiful creeper-covered court leads from the main hall and
contains two extremely fine aviaries housing small Finches in one and
a pair of tame Softbills (I forget these) and Quail in the other. The lawn
in front of the house has Ceylon Junglefowl and various Pheasants
running loose. Usually scores of growing Pheasants are hunting for
insects amongst the flower beds, but Professor Ghigi said that 1937
had been one of the worst years he has experienced for Pheasant rearing
owing to adverse climatic conditions. On the day of our visit he was
lamenting the loss of his hen Blyth's Tragopan, and when we saw this
hen's mate we could fully sympathize with his loss for we had never seen
a more magnificent specimen. From this pair he had a delightful chick,
now independent and in fine form.
Whilst we had been so favourably impressed at the Institute of
Zoology with the means of scientific study of all things ornithological,
it was at Professor Ghigi's house that the writer appreciated the beautiful
surroundings for the Pheasants there maintained. A winding path
leads upwards from the house alongside a wooded glade, and along the

paths were Pheasant aviaries containing pairs of rare Pheasants all in
magnificent condition. Unfortunately we had little time left, as we should
have liked to have; made a detailed list or description of all that these
pheasantries contained, but we particularly noted fine pairs of Imperials,
Mikado, Edward's, and other Kaleege--Horsfield, Bels, etc.--and one
of the finest Elliot's the writer has ever seen.
We were surprised at the small size of Professor Ghigi's aviaries--
all were of a delightful style and the birds they contained were in
faultless condition, yet the aviaries were in many cases only a few yards
square and well sanded and raked. Creepers were trained over the pens
to give shade and well-grown shrubs made enclosures pleasing to the
eye. At the top of this path were several rows of aviaries with cement
shelters and these could be divided into two parts to segregate the
sexes if necessary. We thought of Plumis's remark in Cage Birds ,
regarding the quality of English Swinhoes when we saw Professor
Ghigi's--his certainly were magnificent !
We particularly noted Professor Ghigi's study of climatic require-
ments for different species--thus the Argus and Rheinhardt's Argus
had their aviaries entirely covered with creepers except at the side by
the path, for these species cannot live in comfort and health in direct
sunshine but need heavy shade in summer and reasonable warmth
in winter. We were shown a fine pair of Chinquis Peacock Pheasants
which had not bred this season as the cock had not been fully adult
(there seem to be various opinions on fertility of Peacock Pheasants
in their first year !), and we also saw a trio which Professor Ghigi
asserted could not be told from Germains except by one well acquainted
with Peacock Pheasants but which were, in fact, Chinquis X Germain,
which is a perfectly fertile cross.
There were several pens of fine Blue Crossoptilons which although
not at liberty had large grassy runs with open tops. We were particularly
intrigued by three young Blue Crossoptilons, which were well grown and
the most delightful chicks imaginable as they are so delightfully tame
and friendly. What an ideal country Italy is for rearing Pheasants---
ants are so plentiful that a supply of pupae must be simple to collect,
and silkworm pupae is excellent for both chicks and adults and is
extensively used.

A. C. Ftimer--Failures and Successes in a Member&apos;s Aviary 355
One of the most interesting appliances we saw was a row of perhaps
thirty pens about 1 yard square each. They are made of concrete
slabs with an iron grill at two sides and they are at the top of a cutting
along the path on a level with the eyes. They were heavily sanded
and each contained a rare Pheasant chick of perhaps two months of
age, and Professor Ghigi said how successful these coops were for
conditioning each chick in solitary confinement before liberation to
the breeding pen. This appeared to the writer to be an excellent
method, for when young Pheasants are crowded together the weaker
invariably deteriorate. We noticed in these pens Imperial and
Edward's chicks and others. It is remarkable how similar Imperials
and Edward's hens are in their first year--indeed, Professor Ghigi
had himself great difficulty in saying which was an Imperial chick and
which Edward's.
Alas, we must be off ! " But it is only 5 o'clock," says Professor
Ghigi. We are sorry to differ, but his watch has stopped and it is nearly
6 o'clock and our train leaves for Florence at 6.15. We are driven with
Professor Ghigi to the station and thus ends a most enjoyable and
instructive afternoon, and we must, indeed, thank our host for the
exceedingly kind way in which he has entertained us.

Once again I am making what seems an almost hopeless endeavour
to induce Members who keep the ordinary aviary birds to write for us,
by informing you of the results of my season's successes and failures.
I only aspire to two classes of birds, one class which are generally
known as " the easy to breed varieties ", and the other " the very
tame---never been aviary-bred varieties ".
All the first class are kept in outside aviaries, whereas the second
lot are purely pets and are kept in large cages in my bird-room, and

consist of Black-headed Caiques, a Little Yellow-headed Caique, a
pair of Blue-crowned Hanging Parrots which I have had for some years ;
also a pair of Orange-flanked Parrakeets and a pair of Senegal Parrots.
I also possess a little Cock Ring-necked Parrakeet who, after the manner
of their kind, when kept single, makes a delightfully confiding pet.
It is, however, the so-called " Easily bred " Parrakeets which I
venture to think will be of paramount interest to the ordinary garden
aviculturalist such as myself.
I have two pairs of Red Rumps: one pair have done nothing, but
I am of the opinion that the hen is too young. This is her second year,
and from my limited experience I find that Red Rump hens seldom
prove breeders until the third year.
The other pair of Red Rumps have had two nests, their first starting
in March which produced four hens. I put the nest-box back again
at the end of June and the second nest has produced two cocks and
two hens.
I have learnt a lesson this year by one young hen Red Rump coming
out of the nest w T ith a foot hanging loose from the (knee) joint, and I
believe the cause was dried grass in the nesting box. I have a natural
log for these birds and line the bottom with a grass sod. The grass was
a little too long, and I believe the baby bird got its leg entangled in it.
In future I am going to take care to cut the grass short as a result of
this experience.
My Cockatiel have not done well this season. One nest has produced
five young ones at the first clutch, but although they have laid again
they did not continue to sit.
A second pair have gone to nest twice but they too appear to have
got tired of the job before finishing it and did not hatch out their eggs,
which were all fertile. The latter pair of Cockatiel are in a 40 ft. flight
in which are a pair of Fischer's Lovebirds, so that possibly the disturb-
ance caused by the Fischer's accounts for their deserting, although last
year both Cockatiel and Fischer's reared successfully under the same
conditions.
In my next aviary I had a pair of Kashmirian Moustached Parrakeets,
but as the hen did not moult at the same time as the cock bird, they
spent the whole of the breeding season doing their alternate moults,

and I did not consider it desirable to put a nest-box in for them. Inci-
dentally, I have very loathly had to part with this pair of birds owing
to their very penetrating call, and I was getting complaints from
near-by houses. I have now replaced them, with a pair of Stanley's.
A pair of Black-headed Caiques are neighbours to the Stanley's,
and although they have shown every sign of pairing up, including
the thorough hollowing out of a tree-trunk, they have got no further,
but I think that it is a little too much to hope for, and they should be
placed amongst my second category.
It has been a fairly good season with Lovebirds. I mentioned in
my article last year that although I have kept Fischer's and Masked
Lovebirds since their first importation, I never had any satisfactory
breeding results until I adopted the very definite advice given by the
Marquess of Tavistock to fix boxes outside, and since doing so I have
not had a totally unsuccessful nest, neither have I artificially damped
the eggs.
This year the Masked Lovebirds had reared three when I unfortu-
nately lost the cock parent bird. The Fischer's have reared five
from two nests.
My Bourke's have been the principal failure. Having heard so
much about their propensity for braining themselves and having only
this year got my first pair of Bourke's, I started off by putting them in a
6 ft. aviary and stretching string netting all round.
They went to nest and laid a clutch of three eggs and sat for the
full period of incubation plus three days before giving up. On examining
the eggs I found that two were fertile but had not hatched, apparently
due to dryness.
As the birds seem considerably steadier than they are reputed to be,
I put them in a cold outside flight and fixed a nesting-box in the flight.
They laid again and sat for the full period of incubation, but this time
the eggs were clear.
Another failure was the Kosellas. They have done nothing, and
have never looked like doing anything.
I do not think that it would be out of place in this article to mention
that I have two hen Boulroul Partridges. I got two pairs last year, but
strangely enough both cock birds died and the hens survived, whereas

N. Wliar ton-Tigar--London Zoo Notes
I am told that generally speaking it is the hens who are the more
delicate, and I should be very glad indeed to hear from any Member
who might have had the adverse experience of losing hens and retaining
cocks.
The oaly Finch-like birds which I have possessed during this season
have been Gouldian Finches and a pair of Bed-headed Parrot Finches.
The Gouldians have laid but I think were disturbed by the Parrot
Finches, and I noticed the Parrot Finches occasionally coming out
of the nest when the Gouldians were not there and vice versa, although
there were innumerable nesting sites available. Unfortunately I have
since lost the Parrot Finch hen.
Generally speaking, I think 1937 has been what I should term
a good breeding season amongst my birds in spite of the dry weather.
Now, subject to the Editor's permission, may I ask where are the
other Members of the Society who struggle along with garden aviaries
and the popular aviary birds ?
The Magazine caters well for our interest, and I for one have no
complaint to find with it, but I certainly think that its general interest
would be enhanced to a great many of our Members if only we could
persuade some of our more or less beginners to talk to us and tell us
about their successes, not forgetting to mention their failures, for there
are many lessons which even our more experienced Members could
learn.

To continue the notes on the Pheasants at Begent's Park, besides
the Kaleegi already mentioned, there is Bel's Silver Pheasant ( Gennxus
beli or G. nycthemerus beli) from French Indo-China. Beebe does not
consider this a true species, but classes it as a hybrid. Mr. Delacour
describes it as a sub-species of G. nycthemerus. He originally brought
this Pheasant from French Indo-China, bred them at his famous Park
at Cleres, and presented some to the Zoo. The late Lord Eothschild
also presented specimens. There are quite a number of these birds:
it would appear to the ordinary observer to be merely a more heavily

spangled variety of the Silver Pheasant. Then there is the Black-
breasted Kaleege [Gennseus horsfeldi Gray) which used to be called the
Purple Kaleege, from Eastern Bhutan, Assam, and Upper Burma ;
and the Black-backed Kaleege ( Gennseus melanotis Blyth) from Native
and British Sikhim and Western Bhutan, a handsome little Pheasant
this--but the Kaleege group are less interesting than others because
they interbreed so easily, consequently there are so many forms, but
the Imperial Pheasant is an exception, Gennseus imperialis or, as the
Zoo now call it, Hierophasis imperialis. This is probably the rarest
variety of Pheasant in the collection. These are a pair which were
received from Mr. Delacour in 1928 : this beautiful Pheasant is a small
shining navy blue bird, with red face and legs, a small crest slightly
flecked with wdiite ; the hen is cinnamon brown with red face, she
was moulting when examined, so cannot say whether she has a crest.
No textbook could be found in the Zoo Library giving any account of
this Pheasant, and Mr. Delacour who could, and I know would, tell
us all about it, is at present very far away.
Another very rare Pheasant is Bulwer's Whitetailed-wattled
Pheasant [Lobiaphasus bulweri Sharp) from Central Borneo, brought
over by Lord Moyne in April, 1936. In its native jungle this bird must
be an amazing sight with its glorious sweeping white tail. Mr. Seth-
Smith tells me it has a most wonderful display, and Dr. Heinroth
in Berlin has illustrated it by a most excellent drawing, which it is
hoped may some day be published. He also thought it very likely that
Miss Chawner had seen the display when Mr. Spedan Lewis had
this rare Pheasant. Beebe gives this brief description of the male :
" Neck all around and upper breast crimson, remaining plumage black,
all the feathers margined with steel blue, upper tail coverts and tail
pure white, bare skin of head and wattles bright blue, legs and feet red.
The immature male has the tail coverts and tail chestnut and
resembles the female."
Yet another rare and interesting variety in the collection is the
Mikado Pheasant ( Syrmaticus mikado), Mt. Arizan, Central Formosa.
I find this Pheasant was first discovered by Mr. Walter Goodfellow,
who brought home two long black and white tail feathers he found in
the head-dress of a savage carrying his luggage. The man said he killed

the bird on Mt. Arizan, and it was rare. Mr. Grant named it Calo-
phases mikado. Then in January, 1912, Mr. Goodfellow made a second
expedition to Formosa with the object of bringing live specimens of
the Mikado Pheasant. As a result of this expedition, he brought
home eleven skins and an equal number of live birds for Mrs. E. J.
Johnstone ; here they laid freely, and many young were hatched and
reared. These Pheasants in their native haunts do not live on grain,
but on the leaves of a common low-growing plant, which abounds on
the steep mountain-side, which is their home. This plant is not found
growing below 7,000 feet. The Zoo is fortunate in having a fine pair
of these birds.
I noticed the following varieties of the Fireback : the Bornean
Fireback ( Lophura igmta) blue-faced, chestnut red on back, and
speckled in front; Vieillot's Fireback (. Lophura rufa), Siam, and a
pair of the Siamese Crested Firebacks (Lophura diardi). There are
also examples of the Cheer Pheasant ( Catreus wallichi Hardwick) ;
the Ring-necked Pheasant ( Phasianus torquatus), Manchuria, and
Eastern China, and Elliot's Barred-backed Pheasant ( Symaticus Ellioti ),
S.E. China. I saw a cock and two hens of this very attractive variety,
which is frequently bred both in this country and in France. Also
the Blue-eared Pheasant ( Crossoptilon auritum) from Tibet--and
proudly strutting about a perfectly lovely cock Golden Pheasant
(Chrysolophus pictus), mountains of South and West China, and last,
but not least, an absolutely pure-bred Lady Amherst Pheasant---it
would be impossible to imagine anything more beautiful--West China
and East Tibet.
The interest in these birds is well fostered by the recently formed
Ornamental Pheasant Society, which, I hear, already musters several
hundred members.
I have to thank Mr. Seth-Smith for his kind help to me in preparing
these notes, and also to Mr. Stratton, of the Zoo Library, who looked
up all the available textbooks on the subject. I should also like to
rectify a little mistake I made in writing of the clever finder of a
species of Pheasant in the Belgian Congo (Afropavo conginsia ).
I should have called him Dr. James P. Chapin, Associate Curator
of Birds, American Museum of Natural History, New York.

I never saw the full display of Bulwer's Pheasant. Our bird got
as far as puffing out his blue wattles and letting them hang down like
long blue ear-rings. He spread his magnificent tail sideways, and
drooped his wings, standing in front of his hen, but unfortunately
a boy passed in front of the pen, and the Pheasant would not do any
more. The hen spent some time in a box fixed high up in the shelter,
and we hoped for eggs, but nothing happened.

There has been a certain amount of criticism regarding the attitude
taken by the O.P.S. towards showing Pheasants. It has been argued
that these birds are not suitable for such purposes and suffer from
being thus exposed to " the vulgar gaze ". This criticism is rapidly
dying down for just the one reason that the arguments against showing
have proved utterly fallacious. At the Glasgow Show there were
forty-two entries, which we consider was excellent. I know of one
member who supported the section in no uncertain manner and every
Pheasant was returned none the worse for the double journey.
Mrs. Barrington, who is a keen exhibitor, wrote as follows : "I was
delighted to find how well the Pheasants travelled in the new O.P.S.
pens, not a feather out of place." I was at the Glasgow Show for the
two days and with the exception of one unruly specimen the Pheasants
seemed quite unperturbed and by no means unhappy. One cock in
particular seemed to revel in the attention bestowed upon it and was
continually putting its head through the bars and letting forth its
weird call and delighted in the titbits that were passed to it, not even
refusing a piece of Edinburgh Rock. I will state most emphatically
that the Pheasant section caused as much interest, if not more, than
any other section at the Show. A magnificent Reeve's cock with an
amazing tail length was perhaps the centre of attraction; that cock
had not one single feather out of place and surely this is remarkable
in such a long-tailed species. It is possibly surprising that Pheasants
should adapt themselves so rapidly to such strange conditions, but they
certainly do. Heedless to say, I was asked some strange questions

Correspondence
one of which is worth repetition. An old lady asked me if the Golden
Pheasant was hatched in full plumage ! I forget what my reply was
as I found it so difficult to keep a straight face. The happiest remark
that was made to me came from a gentleman from the North of England:
" I have been to many bird shows but I do not think that I have ever
seen such beauty in any one section, and I consider the Society respon-
sible is to be congratulated on drawing the attention of the public
to birds that you tell me are quite hardy and easy to keep." I took
the first opportunity of 'phoning that remark to my father, and his
delighted chuckle came over the wire and must have been heard through-
out the Hall. One other matter in connection with showing. Last
year the O.P.S. patronized some nine different shows and altogether
some 214 Pheasants were exhibited; of that number only two Pheasants
died as a direct result of being shown, and in both cases it was thought
a draughty hall was the cause. That fact will prove that Pheasants
will not suffer from being exhibited at shows where the O.P.S. take
the necessary precautions, which they certainly will do.

CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, ETC.
Madam, --On 7th June I put out twelve pairs of birds together in a large
outdoor aviary, this is 11 ft. high by 8 ft. by 7 ft. Standing back to the east
against an old red brick wall, against which is a pear tree, it is almost entirely
sheltered from north, and faces south and west. It is by no means in a quiet
position as that part of the garden is on the road, and buses pass within a
few feet very frequently. The small birds delight to forage in clumps of
iris and the old pear.
Kinds as follows : 1 pair Cuban Finches, 2 pairs Orange and Pink-
cheeked Waxbills, 1 pair Cordon Bleus, 1 pair Avadavats, and 1 pair Golden-
breasted Waxbills. They at once became interested in nests, Mr. and
Mrs. Cuban being first in producing two young almost as large as themselves
on 7th August. They at once nested again; result, two more, and I rather
regret to say are at it again ! The next baby to arrive was a complete surprise.
I noticed the Golden-breasted sitting very close together on the floor, and
between them a baby so small that it was difficult to think it could survive,
Next, one pair Orange x Red-cheeked brought out two babies, not much
bigger than an out-sized bumble bee ! The youngest are now about six weeks
old and all flying about, and appear to be in good trim. The Cordon B]eus
set up house in the pear tree, and although they sat tight I eventually found
four infertile eggs. They then again went to nest, and time showed they were
obviously feeding ; this continued for about twelve days when they deserted,

and although I never really interfere, on making sure it was over, assisted
by my butler who is keenly interested and very helpful, we went in with a
pair of steps and inspected the rush nest--one infertile egg and a dead chick,
pinion feathers well developed, signs of food in the crop, and a good halo of
buff feathers on its head. Both these birds are again sitting, this time in a
coco-nut. All seven babies are well (the youngest about six weeks old). The
Avadavats have had several nests and laid eggs, but are inclined to nest on
the floor. The aviary has now been enclosed half-way down and over the roof
with windolite, on screw-on panes. To any one at all interested I would be
pleased to give details as to feeding and general management.

Madam, --Perhaps you will be interested to hear of some important
events which have happened in the Berlin Zoo within the last three months.
A Fork-tailed Humming Bird ( Eupetomena macrocera) which we have had here
since April, 1934, laid an egg on the 24th of this month. Unfortunately the
bird died immediately. As you know, we managed to keep one Humming Bird
for four years and four days. Of course, we regret this loss extremely. Further-
more we have succeeded in breeding the Hammerhead ( Scopus umbretta Gm.)
and the Boat-billed Night Heron ( CocMearius cochlearius). Four young birds,
were hatched and reared, two each. They are now fully grown.

BREEDING OF THE THREE-COLOURED PARROT FINCH (E. trichroa)

Madam, --This species was, I believe, originally imported for Mrs. Johnstone
of Groombridge, nearly thirty years ago. She bred them quite freely and
later on the late Mrs. W. R. Temple bought one or two pairs from her which
also bred and from which stock I obtained a few. My birds were necessarily
somewhat in-bred, but were quite vigorous and prolific.
In 1933 I bought two pairs of E. trichroa var. goodfellowii , these are larger
and handsomer birds than the type and Mr. Goodfellow claimed that they were
hardier also. I am inclined to agree with this statement, as my birds have
often wintered perfectly without heat. Both my pairs reared young in 1934,
one pair I subsequently sold to our member, Mrs. Seymour, who bred young
in 1935 and 1936, in the latter year it was two of the young which bred,
and not the old birds. Some of the young birds came back to me, and by
mating them with some of my own I also bred the species last year, this
being the third generation from the imported birds. This year for some reason
the birds have done nothing but play at nesting, but to-day, 8th November,
I noticed a male chasing a hen and very busily building between times.
This breeding on the threshold of winter must, of course, be stopped,
but I have noticed that many species have continued long after their appointed
seasons. Two young Diamond Doves left the nest last week, and two other
pairs are incubating, three pairs of Jobi Island Doves are sitting, and a pair
of red-headed Parrot Finches have fertile eggs. The latter I propose trans-
ferring to Bengalese, as it is getting rather late in the season to leave the

Dr. Macklin has bred the White-headed Woodpecker ( Melanerpes candidus ).
This is an outstanding achievement, no species of Woodpecker has
previously been bred anywhere.
The Society proposes to award a medal in each case for the breeding of
these several species for the first time in the United Kingdom.
If any previous instance is known to any of our members or readers, they
are requested to communicate at once with the Hon. Secretary, Miss Knobel.
Mr. E. Valentine has bred Goodfellow's Blue-headed Parrot Finch.
Dr. Amsler writes that he bred them in 1934. See his note above.
Mr. Partridge has bred Jackson's Thrush.
These, however, are only subspecies of previously bred species, and the
Society's rules do not permit of medals being awarded in such cases (see the
Society's Medal rules), but the breeders are congratulated on their success.
