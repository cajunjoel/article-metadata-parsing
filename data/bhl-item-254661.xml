By Frank Meaden (Cheshunt, Herts.)
It was in 1948 that we had four young Reed Warblers brought to us
by an over-enthusiastic but well meaning angler who had found them
after cutting down reeds in preparation for his future fishing site : they
were merely skin and dark down, about four days old. However, using
a well insulated box we were able to keep them sufficiently warm
during the following nights to allow their continued growth with no
noticeable ill-effects from their new surroundings or changed diet; a
cardboard carton fully lined with cuttings from polystyrene ceiling tiles
is ideal for such purposes in an emergency of this kind. They were kept
in this warm box until they reached the stage of pecking any edible
item from the tweezers we used for feeding them during this period;
the tissue paper they were huddled in was changed two or three times
daily to avoid soiling their feet or growing plumage. Whilst their
droppings are enclosed in a sac they are so easily removed from the
rearing box, that, should they be collected immediately after feeding,
this being the time they are normally passed, such frequent changing
of tissues becomes unnecessary. Their diet consisted of mealworms,
chrysalids, flies, maggots, etc., with intermediate feeds of Avivite
moistened with milk and to which was then added finely chopped
watercress, comfrey, dandelion or any brassica, grated cheese, steamed
and minced ox heart and liver or steamed freshwater fish, the latter as
and when brought to me by the guilty angler as his form of atonement.
The maggots and mealworms were well powdered with calcium lactate
and a high vitamin content animal food supplement, after a few drops
of a liquid multi-vitamin product had been added to them, so forming
a thin film over their entire surface; if caught unprepared with no
calcium lactate, then finely crushed cuttlefish will prove adequate.

No signs of rickets ever seem to occur if these precautions are taken
and the continued growth, on this occasion, of bone structure, flesh and
plumage gave every reason to believe the birds were progressing quite
normally. As was to be expected, the young birds grew up remarkably
tame, even climbing one's clothes in Tree Creeper fashion at the wean-
ing stage; they all took to the softfood mixture (now minus the milk)
quite readily, in fact seemingly preferring this to gentles, although their
taste for flies, chrysalids and mealworms never lessened. With the late
autumn the whiter throats and subdued song practice of two intimated
that we might have two pairs; one pair was given the freedom of a
sheltered outdoor aviary for the wdnter and the other housed with a
pair of Black Redstarts which, although fed and housed mainly in a
large indoor flight, did have access to an outside flight throughout the
winter. Despite an electric lighting system arranged in the outdoor
enclosure to provide extra light for feeding time, extended to enable
feeding between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. during the short winter days, plus
the fact that this pair of birds roosted within inches of the bulb and its
warmth, the birds died the following February/March within a day or
so of each other : the remaining pair was, in the following April, given
an outdoor enclosure which covered half a small goldfish pond and
approximately a square yard of reeds. In early May both birds were
observed carrying small strips of dead reeds; however, instead of taking
this material to the reed bed, the female proceeded to build the normal
nest but in a clump of fir and heather between four and five feet from
the ground. It was solely the hen which built while the male seemed to
sing from morn till night. The enclosure itself measured about eight
feet square by six feet high, two thirds of the area being water and bog;
the aviary had been built around an old apple tree which grew at the
side of the garden pool and almost the only solid ground was at the
base of this tree, the remaining soil being peat overflowed copiously
with the excess water from the pool. Perhaps due to my own inquisitive-
ness or maybe a visiting field mouse, no eggs were laid in this first nest
and it was only when I failed to see the hen one day that I searched
and found her incubating three green/blue and heavily blotched eggs
that I realised a further nest had been built, this time almost six feet
from the ground in dead twigs from the previous year and barely
hidden by the leaves of a low apple branch only just inside the aviary I
wire and in such a manner that, once aware of its presence, we could
peep into it from outside the enclosure. Not knowing the exact dates \
the eggs were laid I can give no definite hatching time but it seemed
extremely short, no more than twelve days and possibly a little less;
my notes show that I found three eggs on the 2nd June, 1949, and two
young were first seen in the nest on the 12th of that month with a |
further one appearing the following day; another egg was eventually j
discovered weeks later embedded in the base of the nest. Apart from 1

the natural insect life of the pond and surrounding wet peat, we
provided the diet previously described with extra mealworms, these
being selected as small as possible for the first week, from our own
insectary, plus two or three handfuls daily of old bees' comb, alive
with wax moth larvae; this has always proved most popular with my
stock. The record card for this breeding is rather smudged and blurred,
hence the date for nestlings emerging is indistinct, and it appears to be
June 24th, but could be the 27th; however, I well recall being amazed
at that time just how small and mouse-like they seemed in their climb-
ing, also at their short stay in the nest. Having proved so useful on
numerous occasions, I feel that mention should be made here of the
importance of keeping record cards, so much data regarding nesting
materials, dates, food taken, courtship displays, etc., can be thus
referred to in later years. These three youngsters, regardless of their
earlier minute appearance, grew to be exactly like carbon copies of the
parent birds; eventually I found the three to be one male and two
females.
My only further comments on this bird are that despite the somewhat
sombre plumage, it is well worth keeping and studying at close
quarters; the song so loud and boisterous when delivered throughout
the breeding season can, when one's eyes are closed, conjure up the
beauty of old waterside haunts of years gone by for those of us who
are now forced to live in towns. The diet can be coarser than that
which I have used, but caring for a number of more delicate species, I
do tend to use a standard base food and endeavour to create variety
in the food intake by additives of proven value to humans and by live
insects. All the five birds were liberated during May 1950 near a small
backwater adjoining a local watercress bed and without being over-
sentimental I would venture to comment that I received great satisfac-
tion from frequent visits to this site just to hear the song continued in
the wild. Whether from our stock we will never know, but the Reed
Warbler certainly returned there each spring for at least another four
years whilst I lived in that district, breeding successfully on each
occasion, but only one nest as compared to the two we recorded whilst
under controlled conditions. Today I have two pairs of the Great Reed
Warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus which I hope may breed in the
future. Their song is very similar to the smaller birds' but with the
volume as powerful as that of a Song Thrush. Perhaps mention also
ought to be made of the nest materials used by the birds which bred in
J 949i when inspected at the end of the season, the nests were found to
be constructed of thin pieces of reed, grasses, fine roots, moss, a few
feathers and a great deal of dog hair; it is reasonable to imagine the
last as not being a normal material to these birds, but having accumu-
lated much of this from our dogs' brushings we offered it, as is our
normal habit each year, to most of our aviary inmates.

By D. Grenville Roles (Deputy Curator of Birds)
One of the most beautiful species of the whole family, the Pink-
crested Touraco Tauraco erythrolophus is found in suitable localities
throughout Zaire and Angola. Our specimens came from the vicinity
of Luanda in Angola, arriving in May 1971.
Lovely birds about the size of a pigeon with long, fan-shaped tails,
they possess the curious hairy plumage so typical of the family. The
face is white, neck and breast a shade of light green, belly and vent
sooty black. The mantle and wing-coverts are iridescent emerald, back
and rump black, shot with emerald, and the tail is violet. Remiges are
crimson, while the rounded crest is red with a white tip at the apex.
The large brown eyes are surrounded by a thin red wattle, accentuated
by short narrow black stripes both above and below. The bill is bright
yellow, greenish basally, and the legs are black.
After initial quarantining the birds were rung and housed in a large
aviary 12 ft. x 24 ft. x 7 ft., well planted and grassed with an open
shelter at the rear (which they shared with a pair of Satyr Tragopans).
The birds settled in very well, coming through their first winter,
fortunately a very mild one, without experiencing any difficulty.
The following season, 1972, came and went without any noticeable
change in the birds' behaviour being noted until January 1973, when
two of them appeared to be pairing up. Aggressive behaviour by these
birds was also seen to develop towards the others until they were split
in June, when both pairs were transferred to a new range of aviaries.
Their new aviaries had the advantage of enclosed shelters at the
rear, into which chicks could be shut for safety until they were reason-
ably independent. Each of the aviaries was particularly well planted
and housed pairs of Palawan Peacock Pheasants. Flights were 12 ft. x
20 ft. x 7 ft., with the 4 ft. wide shed running the width of the aviary.
The sheds were built on a brick base and had concrete floors. The birds
were fed and watered in the shed which also contained nesting plat-
forms and boxes for both touracos and pheasants.
The birds behaved perfectly, with courtship feeding seen to take
place a number of times (though mating was never observed) and soon
they laid their first egg, on the 7th July, and a second on the 9th. These
were incubated by both birds but after a month were deserted and
found to be infertile. A second clutch of four eggs was started on the
18th August, but the clutch size and its again proving infertile led me
to believe that the " pair " were two hens. Now, however, the second
pair looked as if they were going to, " do something ", with much twig
carrying and aggressive behaviour to a neighbouring pair of Schalow's

Touracos, so Pair i were kept together and not tried with different
mates.
A third infertile clutch was produced by the first pair in late
September, the second pair producing nothing at all. The pairs were
kept as they were until the nth May, 1974, when, after a further
infertile clutch from the first pair and no breeding activity from the
second, the pairs were split.
The move proved successful with the resident hen/new cock pair,
which produced the first egg of a fertile clutch of two eggs on the
25th May--only a fortnight after they had been introduced.
Remarkably, absolutely no aggressive behaviour was shown by either
of the resident birds to their new mates, much to our relief.
The incubation period lasted for 23 days from the laying of the first
egg, when on the 17th June both eggs were found to have hatched. The
brooding hen sat very tightly on both eggs and chicks, refusing to leave
when the shed was entered for servicing--unlike her mate who fled
whenever the door was opened. This hen would even allow her eggs to
be inspected without fleeing--pecking the intruding hand very hard
while she spread and raised her wings in the typical threat posture. It
was only by a change in the female's brooding posture--sitting " high "
on the nest instead of squatting that we had any indication that the
chicks had hatched---which we quickly confirmed.
The chicks were pink-fleshed and covered in thick black down. Their
legs were pinkish-grey and the bill (apart from its black tip) and facial
skin were white. Mouth lining was bright pink and tiny white claws
were visible on each alula.
The chicks developed at the usual rate, by comparison with the
other species we have bred (Roles, 1973) and at 18 days were well
covered with thick black down. Both tail and wing quills were starting
to erupt and both legs and bill had a pinkish hue.
At 23 days the crimson of the remiges was apparent, and pin
feathers were evident on the neck and breast.
At 25 days both chicks left the nest never to return. They were not
seen to be brooded any further by either parent, but solicited feeding
every time a parent approached.
When 45 days old the chicks were still very dark with a few green
feathers opening on the neck and breast. The wings were showing
darker emerald than the adults with a much reduced area of crimson.
The tail was violet and the first red, white-tipped crest feathers were
opening. A small white patch also appeared over the ear-coverts.
The chicks were separated from their parents at 79 days when still
slightly smaller than the adults; they possessed comparatively greyish
faces, rather duller bills, and smaller crimson areas in their wings, but
otherwise were almost identical.
A second clutch of two eggs was started on the 17th August. Both

eggs were fertile and hatched, but one chick died on 30th August, with
fatty degeneration of the liver being found on examination.
While the birds had chicks in the nest, an additional 8 a.m. feed
was provided consisting of soaked dried fruit, finely chopped lettuce,
finely chopped banana and tomato, the whole covered with a liberal
sprinkling of Vionate, a multivitamin supplement.
The "main course" feed, provided around 11.30-12.00 a.m., con-

mixture and minced boiled egg.
The birds during the year 1974 reared to independence three fine
strong young birds, which we believe to be a first successful breeding
in the U.K.

In vol. 79 No. 4 Avicultural Magazine I described the nesting of
the Black-headed Sibia with the fledged young dying--presumably of
cold. This season (1974) I have had better results from the same
parents, the original pair purchased in February 1971. In March 1973
they were put into an outside flight 4 x 2 x 2m. which is thickly
planted with two clumps of bamboo and honeysuckle growing up the
wire. No attempt was made at nesting at all during 1973 so they were
once again brought into my bird room in October for the winter. As
the winter turned out to be fairly mild I could probably have left them
out all winter, but with small foreign soft-bills I consider it best if they
are kept inside during the worst months. In April this year I again put
them into the open flight and as nothing happened during the early
summer, I thought it would be another fruitless year, but to my sur-
prise on the 8th July I saw the cock displaying with a strand of fibre
in his beak--the same fibre from the Chusan palm Trachycarpus
fortunei which I usually supply for nesting material. Nest construction

rather like a Greenfinch's egg, but a trifle larger. Both parents took
turns to sit and two young were hatched on the 16th August. Providing
the essential live food was not such a problem as I had expected--
mainly because it has been a good year for wasps. In the period from
16th August to about the end of September they must have consumed
several thousand wasps which are attracted to the aviary by a dish of
jam and honey etc. It is interesting to note that the few bees that came
were not touched in any way. Another interesting way in which wasps
were encouraged was that under the bamboo leaves are hundreds of
tiny green aphids which exude a sticky substance which attracts flies
which in their turn attract wasps so is altogether a quite convenient
food chain. Incidentally the adults always remove the sting from the
wasp before feeding it to the young. On the 31st August the babies
came out of the nest; the following week the weather was appalling
with heavy rain and terrific winds, but I was pleased to see the young
birds huddled together at night under a piece of glass placed over the
roof to keep off the rain. On the 18th September the young were seen
to feed on a few pieces of cut up grape, but the adults were very good
and continued to supply live food. On the 30th September the babies
were still begging to be fed--flapping the wings after the manner of
young Blackbirds. I removed them from the parents on the 1st October
as the father was beginning to get aggressive. I would guess that the
young are a true pair; they roost close together at night and this has
probably been the reason they survived this late part of the season.
With regard to appearance and colour they are exactly like the adults
with perhaps a little lighter brown across the back.

BREEDING THE PALAWAN PEACOCK PHEASANT AT
JERSEY ZOOLOGICAL PARK

By David Jeggo (Jersey, Channel Islands)
The Palawan Peacock Pheasant Polyplectron emphanum is endemic
to the island of Palawan in the Philippines and is sparsely distributed
over the island. Although as yet no detailed study has been carried out
on its status in the wild, this species is considered to be rare and is
listed in the i.u.c.n. red data book as endangered.
Inhabiting the damp tropical forest at moderate altitudes, the
Palawan Peacock Pheasant is under increasing pressure, due to the
continuing clearance of its habitat. The island is some 300 miles in
length and up to twenty or so miles wide and the exact range of habitat
favourable to this species is not known. A number of specimens exist, in
collections in America and Europe, but in most cases they are isolated
pairs or single birds. However, Dr. K. G. Searle maintains a number in
the aviaries of the Botanic Garden, Hong Kong, where many young
have been bred, and as he wished to establish another nucleus he
presented six pairs to the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust. The first
birds, an unrelated pair, arrived on 1st September, 1972, followed by
three immature pairs on the 28th December, 1972, and a further two
pairs on 5th April, 1974.
Accommodation
While new accommodation was being constructed three pairs were
housed in existing aviaries which measure 6.5 x 1.8 x 1.8 m. high, with
shelters of 1.8 x 2 x 1.75 m. high. These aviaries were planted with a
variety of shrubs with grassed areas, the remainder being sanded.
Between each was a division of opaque rigid perspex to a height of
1 m. to prevent visual contact, thereby eliminating fighting between
different males. These aviaries were unheated but the birds were
confined at night during the winter months, to the inside areas, which
had concrete floors to exclude rodent predators, a layer of sand being
spread over the floor. The remaining birds were housed in the tropical
bird room in a cage measuring 5.6 x 2.2 x 2 m. high which was heated
at 20-22* C. and kept at a fairly high relative humidity.
In the spring of 1973 the Howard Aviaries (presented to the Jersey
Wildlife Preservation Trust by two members, Mr. and Mrs. Howard)
were constructed. These six aviaries were designed to house one pair of
Palawan Peacock Pheasants each in association with one pair of
touracos Musophagidae of various species, to inhabit the upper level.
Each aviary consists of an outside area measuring 6x4x2m. high
with an unheated shelter 4 x 1.2 x 2 m. high, to which the birds can
be confined during winter nights. The outside areas are landscaped
with boulders of Jersey granite and planted with a wide variety of

shrubs, grasses and creepers, thus making an attractive setting and
providing cover where the birds have a degree of privacy and open
lawn areas where they can be easily viewed.
Diet
Up to December 1973, poultry layers' pellets were fed, substituted
by pheasant breeder pellets in the breeding season. Turkey breeder
pellets are now fed throughout the year and mixed seed is also avail-
able. Every six months in April and October the birds are wormed
with I.C.I. Game Bird wormer, given in the drinking water.
Description
The Palawan is perhaps the most beautiful species of the genus
Polyplectron and the male is a fine looking bird; the black of the neck
extends down throughout the underparts, the mantle is an iridescent
blue/green, many of these feathers being variously edged and patterned
with black. The primaries and secondaries are a dark brown/black.
The back and rump are a dark grey-brown speckled with rows of tiny
pale golden blotches producing a banded effect. The broad moderately
long tail is comprised of 22-24 rectrices and both rectrices and long
upper tail-coverts decreasing in length from the centre outwards. The
rectrices and coverts are a dark grey/brown speckled with tiny pale
cream blotches, these forming a distinct pale narrow band at the tip
of each feather, then leaving a clear dark band, which gives way to
random speckling over the rest of the feather. On either side of the
rachis towards the distal end of each of these feathers is a metallic ovate
turquoise " eye " with a surround of black, then cream. Passing out-
wards over the tail feathers the ocelli on the inner web gradually
degenerate. The whole structure gives the effect of a beautiful striking
eyed fan when spread in display. The colour of the head is black shot
with a blue/green sheen, apart from a white lanceolate cheek patch
and in some specimens also a white superciliary stripe which can join
at the nuchal area (such specimens are sometimes referred to as
Napoleon's Peacock Pheasant). This variation seems to occur at random
and apparently is not regional; all the adult males at Jersey exhibit the
stripe. A thin elongated wedge-shaped black/blue crest lies raised at a
slight angle from the head, curved up a little towards the rear. The
iris is dark brown with a narrow surround of red skin on the eyelids.
Bill and legs are black; the latter possess 2-3 small sharp spurs.
The female is a smaller (400 mm. against 500 mm. for the male, the
tail accounting for about 80 mm. of this difference) and drabber bird,
having a general body colour of dull bronzy brown. The wings have
some dark markings and on the tail there are traces of ocelli, the cheeks
and superciliary area are pale grey merging into brown and in most
specimens a small depressed dark crest is present. Immature birds
closely resemble the female, males not obtaining their adult plumage
until the second year and are often not in full colour until the third

year, although they can usually be distinguished by their greater size
and slight difference of marking at a few months.
The moult into adult plumage happens gradually during the second
year, the tail and cheek patches being usually the first to appear along
with occasional black feather on the breast and blue in the mantle.
Immature birds at Jersey exhibit fully developed adult tails and white
cheek patches with crest, the rest of the body still having the immature
coloration.
The head and mantle of the chick are a gingery brown with a dark
brown stripe extending down from the crown to the nuchal area where
it broadens out. The under parts are the same gingery brown, shading
to a much paler colour on the belly. Down the back and rump is a
broad stripe of deep rich burnt umber, bordered on either side by a thin
stripe of pale yellow ochre which is separated from the pale belly
colour by a narrow stripe of dark brown. The bill is deep chestnut
brown in colour, paler at the tip and has an area of dark grey around
the cere; the legs are dull pink.
Breeding
The Palawan Peacock Pheasant is strictly monogamous and there-
fore only one breeding pair is housed in each aviary.
A lateral courtship display has often been observed in adult and
immature males and on occasions in females, gaining frequency
through the new year to become most intense at the end of March and
beginning of April. The male calls up the female to feed then ruffs
and fans his plumage, tilting the colourful and beautifully patterned
dorsal surface towards her as he circles around her (see illustration).
Potential breeders are provided with boxes measuring 44 x 30 x
22 cm. deep completely open at the top and half filled with hay, fixed
at height of 1.5 m. to serve as elevated nest sites. These are used, but
there seems to be little preference, a scrape in the ground among cover
being equally favoured.
Laying at Jersey commences at the end of March, one or two eggs
forming the normal clutch. They are white in colour and the average
size from a sample of ten eggs was 49 x 36.5 mm. which is a little
larger than that quoted by Delacour (45 x 36 mm.). The incubation
period of 18 days is constant. The eggs are collected as soon as found
and set under a broody bantam when the clutch is complete in a
maximum of three days.
The smallest and steadiest broody bantams available are used because
of the small clutch size and the eggs and chicks so small and delicate.
From the first small chip in the shell to complete hatching has been
observed to take only two hours. When completely dry and walking at
about 24 to 36 hours old, chicks and hen are transferred inside to a
box. These boxes are unheated and measure approximately 60 x 50 x
40 cm. high. Three sides, floor and lid are plywood and die front is of

glass to admit light; there is a perforated zinc panel in the lid for
ventilation.
The basic rearing diet consists of live food (crickets and mealworms)
chick crumbs and a little mashed hard-boiled egg yolk. Getting chicks
to feed at first is a little more difficult than in most other pheasants,
as they rely on their parent to feed them. The presence of the broody
bantam helps in this respect, calling up the chick much as the natural
parent would, but often she consumes the food when the chick does
not respond quickly. Newly hatched Golden Pheasants Chrysolophus
pictus have been introduced for the Palawan to mimic their feeding
habits. However, all the Palawan chicks have at first been offered
mealworms held just in front of the bill, between thumb and forefinger
(tweezers being equally good), and usually quickly learning to take these;
one reluctant feeder was picked up and force fed to start with. To
encourage chicks to pick up food for themselves, crumbs as well as live
food are scattered all over the floor; also a little Savel No. i dog biscuit
can be sprinkled about, its bright yellow colour encouraging them to
peck at it.
Birds have usually learned quickly, thereafter having crumbs and egg
available in a small shallow dish with another for water, live food being
dropped in every few hours throughout the day.
At the age of about 2-3 v/eeks the chicks are transferred outside
with the broody bantam to rearing coops. These are box like construc-
tions 275 cm. x 60 x 75 cm. high, the first 75 cm. is totally enclosed the
remaining 200 cm. has an open wire mesh front and no floor, the coop
being moved to a fresh patch of short grass daily. The two sections
communicate by a small slide enabling the birds to be confined to the
house part when necessary. The food is placed in a small box which
projects from the front of the house; light is let into this through a
wire grid on the front. Chicks are usually moved out of these when
well feathered, but can be left for longer.
In 1973 on 12th July a chick a day or two old was observed with its
parents. This had hatched from an overlooked egg and was reared to
maturity by its parents. The chick obtained much of its food from what
could be found naturally in the aviary but in addition a few mealworms
were cast in several times a day and the normal pellet ration was
replaced by chick crumbs. Both parents called and fed the chick. The
chick development was very much the same as the artificially raised
ones. At first it spent much time brooded by the mother under cover,
the father often in close attendance. Although coming out in the open
progressively more as it grew, much time was spent under cover, coming
out to feed when called but quickly returning to safety. It perched the
first time when 13 days old : before the mother had brooded it on the
ground close to the nest site, the father roosting up on a branch.

1973-- During 1973 seven eggs were laid by two pairs, the adult
pair laying three clutches of a single egg and a second year pair (still
in juvenile plumage) laid three clutches, two of a single egg and one
of two eggs. The first was laid on the 28th March and the last in late
June. Of the seven eggs one was thin-shelled and broken, one damaged
by the broody bantam, one infertile and one contained a dead embryo.
Three hatched, one from each pair by a broody bantam and one female
Palawan incubated and reared her own.
1974-- A total *f J 5 eggs were laid in 1974, all four pairs in their
second year (or over) laying, the males of the three second year birds
being in partial adult plumage. All clutches were of single eggs; the first
was laid on 22nd March and the last on 12th August and all eggs were
given to broody bantams for incubation. Three eggs were broken before
collection possibly through egg-eating; one egg was infertile. Of the
eleven fertile eggs, one contained a dead embryo, two were squashed by
the hen, five were dead in shell (one was deformed and another
malpositioned in the shell) and three hatched, two chicks to the original
adult pair and one to the pair that bred in 1973.
During the first two years of the Palawan Peacock Pheasant breeding
programme six pairs have been imported and from these six young
produced. It is hoped that they are now fully acclimatized and well
settled in Jersey, so in future years many young will be produced, thus
helping to strongly establish the species in avicultural circles, ensuring
its survival and possibly providing stocks for re-introduction into its
natural habitat should this seem prudent and likely to be successful.
The Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust is grateful to Dr. K. C.
Searle for presenting the original stock and for all his help and support.
To Mr. and Mrs. Howard who so kindly donated the funds for the
aviaries to be constructed; also to Philip Wayre for his advice on
husbandry and to B.O.A.G. who flew the birds free of charge from
Hong Kong.

THE AMETHYST WOODSTAR HUMMINGBIRD, WITH
OBSERVATIONS ON THE ECLIPSE PLUMAGE

The Amethyst Woodstar Calliphlox amethystina can be found in
eastern Ecuador, north-eastern Peru, northern Bolivia, eastern
Venezuela, the Guyanas, the greater part of Brazil, Paraguay and
north-eastern Argentina (Peters, 1945).
The male has the fastest wing beat (80 per second) so far recorded
for a hummingbird (Greenwalt, i960). It also has the highest meta-
bolic rate of all known vertebrates (Ruschi, 1973).
Adult males, which are approximately 3J inches overall length, have
the upperparts shining bronze-green; throat and sides of neck glittering
rosy red bordered with dull white, remainder of underparts dull bronzy
green washed with grey. The tail which is deeply forked, has the central
feathers shining olive; remainder dusky violet tipped pale grey. Note-
worthy is the fact that when the bird is at rest, the tail feathers are held
in a crossed position (see plate).
Females are like the males on the upperparts but have a whitish
throat with the remainder of the underparts greyish washed with
rufous on the sides. The tail is short and square, central feathers green,
remainder black tipped with cinnamon. Due to the shorter tail feathers,
females have an overall length of approximately 3 inches. Bodywise,
however, they are slightly larger than the males.
Immature males are very much like the females, but are deeper grey
on the abdomen, have longer tail feathers without the cinnamon tips
and have the throat whitish heavily mottled with grey.
Adult male Amethyst Woodstars have a non-breeding dress in that,
at certain times of the year, the glittering throat feathers are replaced
with whitish feathers heavily mottled with grey. This non-breeding
dress appears to be retained for six to eight weeks only, after which the
bird goes into a complete moult and the glittering feathers reappear.
I have no idea as to why the species should have a non-breeding dress,
especially as it appears to be kept for so short a period. The males I
have owned and those owned by friends, have all gone into this eclipse
plumage usually during late summer or early autumn.
Adult males in non-breeding dress are easily distinguished from
immature birds as they not only have longer tail feathers, but also have
much more green on the underparts.
Although it is most unusual for a hummingbird species to have a
non-breeding dress, the Amethyst Woodstar is not unique in this respect
as out of the breeding season the Peruvian Sheartail Thaumastrura
cora loses the glittering throat feathers and the extremely long, white
tail feathers (Johnson, 1967). Also Ruschi (1973) mentions that the

Blue-tufted Starthroat Heliomaster furcifer has a non-breeding dress.
As can be seen, however, Ruschi is not correct in thinking that birds
from the genus Heliomaster are the only ones from the Trochilidae
with an eclipse plumage phase.
Perhaps it is worth mentioning that although I have, or have access
to most of the works appertaining to the Trochilidae, I have been
unable to find any mention of the non-breeding dress in C. amethystina.
It is possible therefore, that this occurrence is unknown to ornitholo-
gists. Although widespread, the Amethyst Woodstar is rarely brought
into Britain and the few which do come in are often in a state of
exhaustion and therefore require special attention if they are to survive.
Being very small, it is preferable to house these birds in a cage (pairs
will live together amicably). However, once fully established, it is
possible to house them in small flights with other species of similar size.
I have found the species to be somewhat lethargic whilst in immature
plumage, but once adult plumage is attained, the birds appear to take
a much greater interest in life.
The display of the adult male consists of the throat feathers being
puffed out, the deeply forked tail being spread and held under the
body and the head and body being held stiffly with the beak pointing
directly at the female. The male then flies very slowly (even though the
wings are beating faster than in normal flight) towards the female.
When the male's beak is almost touching the female, he reverses, again
very slowly. Each time the male thrusts itself forward, the wings make
a cracking sound like that of a whip.
I have yet to hear a woodstar sing; however, they do have a mon-
otonous piping call-note which can be heard whenever they become
agitated for some reason.

BEHAVIOUR AND BREEDING OF THE
MOUNTAIN BLUEBIRD IN CAPTIVITY

Sialia currucoides
By Benedict G. Pinkowski (Washington, Michigan, U.S.A.)
The bluebirds of the New World (genus Sialia) represent an endemic
genus of thrushes (family Muscicapidae, subfamily Turdinae) consisting
of three species often compared to the Eurasian Redstarts Phoenicurus .
The redstarts and bluebirds are similar in size, and in general behaviour
and nesting habits.
The Eastern Bluebird Sialia sialis is the best known of the three blue-
birds and has been reported (Butler, 1907) to breed in captivity.
Wallace (1972) noted that it is compatible with other species when kept
in confinement. The Mountain Bluebird Sialia currucoides is not as
well known, but it is closely related to its eastern relative and the two
species do hybridize (Lane, 1968). The most apparent difference
between the two is probably in plumage. The male Mountain Bluebird
lacks the orange of the breast of the male Eastern Bluebird, and the
blue and orange of females of the latter are replaced by grey and
brown in Mountain Bluebird females. The Mountain Bluebird is also
slightly larger, has a proportionately longer wing chord, and is perhaps
a bit more pugnacious than its relative.
I collected four Mountain Bluebirds in the Badlands, South Dakota,
U.S.A., during June 1972. Three were taken as nestlings, one as a
fledgling, and were hand-reared to independence, at which time they
were placed in a large cage (6 ft. x 12 ft. x 5 ft.) until completion of
their post-juvenal moult. At that time they were transferred, pairwise,
to breeding units which consisted of a large cage (120 cubic ft.) con-
nected to a smaller cage (approximately 60 cubic ft.). This arrangement
was designed to reduce aggression and permit additional exercise, and
previously had worked well for my Eastern Bluebirds (Pinkowski, 1974).
Nest-boxes of the standard type were supplied, except that one of the
(wooden) sides was removed and replaced with screen to permit
observation. The openings measured 1.5 inches in diameter, and the
birds entered readily despite the claims by Haecker (1948) that an
opening of that size is too small for this species. Photoperiods were
manipulated by employing inexpensive timers; each change was of the
order of 15 minutes, but the overall pattern corresponded closely to
natural changes in daylength. Food consisted of mealworms ( Tenebrio ),
crickets (Acheta), insects obtained by " sweeping " and various types of
traps, and fruit. I found that the birds are very fond of peanut hearts,
which also have been used to trap Eastern Bluebirds (Fast, 1955).
Since little information is available on the Mountain Bluebird in
captivity, I am setting forth some of my observations in the following.

During the years 1973 and 1974 seven nests of this species were
attempted by the four birds referred to above. The observations are
based on these birds as well as one juvenile reared to 10 days by one
pair and subsequently taken over and hand-reared by me for more
careful observations.

Foraging Behaviour
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999716512820513" page_id="56381316"  page_num="16" year="" vol="">
The development of self-feeding behaviour patterns was observed
and apparently involves a sequence of five steps which may be sum-
marized as follows : (1) observation of prey (especially moving insects)
from a distance, but with no predation attempt (common almost
immediately after nest departure, at 18 days); (2) seizing and mandibu-
lating prey, which is not thoroughly prepared and is usually discarded
(19-20 days), although very small items may be ingested; (3) consump-
tion of prey after mandibulation but with little preparation otherwise
(21-23 days); (4) mandibulation and thorough preparation of prey, the
latter involving gradually perfected behaviours of " scissoring " and
"hammering" (Krieg, 1971) the prey (24-26 days); and (5) perfection
of the self-feeding behaviour patterns (27-28 days) so that the limbs,
elytra, and wings of large prey items ( e.g ., crickets, beetles) are system-
atically removed, the prey is taken to a large flat surface for prepara-
tion, and some selectivity is demonstrated with regards to what is taken.
Although these behaviours emerge gradually, they appear innate
and are influenced only to a minor extent by learning. Mueller (1974)
made similar observations on the American Kestrel (Falco spawerius).
The most notable result of this gradual progress in the direction of
independence is seen in the bird's increased ability to exploit larger
prey items. At independence (35-45 days) the complete spectrum of
prey normally consumed by the species is available.
Nearly all types of insects are accepted by Mountain Bluebirds,
although crickets, beetles, moths, and caterpillars seem preferred. The
Mountain Bluebird is more insectivorous than the Eastern Bluebird
(see Beal, 1915), and fruit was never an important part of the diet of
the captive birds, especially during the breeding period. Sumac Rhus
typhina was the most common fruit eaten, and it was preferred over
more succulent fruits ( e.g . cherries Prunus and some dogwoods Cornus).
Although " hovering " (searching for prey while remaining on the
wing) is a common type of foraging employed by Mountain Bluebirds
in the wild (Power, 1966), it was not common in captivity, even when
for brief times I allowed the birds to enter larger quarters. Hovering
was not noted until the young were at least 35 days old, and was
accomplished expertly by one young 37 days old and another 43 days
old. Thus this more complex foraging behaviour emerges 2 to 3 weeks
after the birds normally begin first taking food for themselves (at about
21 days). Simultaneously with the acquisition of the ability to hover
the birds are capable of executing " controlled falls "; i.e., food morsels

the ground as the bird quickly descends to retrieve the item, usually in
mid-air.

Drinking and Bathing

<bodyText confidence="0.997257181818182" page_id="56381315"  page_num="17" year="" vol="">
Although Power (1966) did not observe wild Mountain Bluebirds
drinking water at any time, the captive birds took water at least once
daily. Bathing was also common in captivity, and was observed from
one fledgling only 23 days old. Although Potter and Hauser (1974)
suggested that bathing is more common in Eastern Bluebirds during
the period of the moult, I found no evidence for this in the captive
Mountain Bluebirds.
Ants of several species were offered to the birds from time to time,
and although these were readily eaten, the Mountain Bluebirds were
not seen anting. Sialia is apparently the only genus of New World
thrushes which does not ant (Whitaker, 1957).

Roosting
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989536379310345" page_id="56381315"  page_num="17" year="" vol="">
The Mountain Bluebirds were unusual in their roosting habits in
several respects. When the main series of lights was extinguished in the
aviary rooms and a set of dim lights remained on for a time in order to
permit the birds to reach their roosting sites (or to permit the brooding
hen to enter the nest-box), an interesting complication arose. This
procedure had previously worked well for Eastern Bluebirds, but the
Mountain Bluebirds persisted in remaining active, even in the faintest
light. I could find no satisfactory explanation for this, although since
numerous workers (Criddle, 1927) state that this species is vocally active
at dawn and dusk, I must conclude that it is simply the normal habit
of the bird. In the end a special switch to dim the lights gradually (as
well as my presence and a certain measure of patience for their antics)
was required for the birds to settle down completely.
The fledglings often roosted side by side (adults rarely did this),
usually in the highest spot available. Twittering calls ensue from these
juveniles before they go to the roost, an unusual behaviour noted for
other hole-nesting species (Kilham, 1974). Some individuals displayed
an acute awareness of the " time of the day " and would begin prospect-
ing for roost sites shortly before the lights were extinguished, often
flying nervously while giving loud " location calls." Although nest-
boxes were always available, they were seldom used for roosting.
Singing
Overall, the Mountain Bluebird is much quieter than the Eastern
Bluebird. However, with the advent of the breeding season two song
types were distinguished. One, which is not unlike that of the American
Robin Turdus migratorius , is most often sung in the dim light of early
morning but was also heard in complete darkness in the captive birds
and has been reported at night in the wild (Weydemeyer, 1934). This
song is loud and emphatic, but is sung infrequently.

A second song is more properly classified as a repetitious warble, a
soft, continuous " eee-cc-e 33 totally unlike anything I have noted from
our other native species. This warble is common at all times of the day
and may go on for many minutes consecutively.

Courtship and Nest-Building
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987614666666667" page_id="56381314"  page_num="18" year="" vol="">
Courtship behaviour in Mountain and Eastern Bluebirds is remark-
ably similar, a fact which no doubt permits the hybridization between
the two species. Males precede females in nest site inspections and
during the courtship period the cock regularly feeds the hen, often
taking a morsel into the nest cavity first in an apparent attempt to
encourage her " interest " in the nest. Some males are very persistent
in their attempts to courtship-feed their females, forcefully poking at
the female's beak with items and returning several times to attempt a
feeding if she is unreceptive. These feedings continue throughout the
nesting cycle. Once nest-building is underway (only the female builds),
the male may enter the cavity and mandibulate or remove bits of
grasses, a behaviour which invariably attracts the female's attention
and may prompt a bout of nest-building by her.
Nests are built of dry grasses for the most part, with finer material
placed in the lining of the nest cup, where a few small feathers may be
added as well. Nest-building takes longer for first nests of a season
(11 and 14 days) than for second nests (4 and 5 days) as observed in
one female during two consecutive years. During two separate observa-
tions of nest-building, the hen entered the box a total of 66 times with
material during 142 minutes (about once every 2 minutes), and spent
6 to 21 seconds inside the box per trip (depending largely on whether
or not she would re-shape the nest while inside).
For one female, nest-building commenced at daylengths of 14.75 hrs.
and 13.25 hrs. during her first and second seasons respectively (the day-
light period on the increase in each case).
Egg-Laying
One young female laid her first egg at an age of 255 days (approxi-
mately 8J months). An egg was laid each day in four of five clutches,
with one day skipped during the second clutch of the second season.
Clutch sizes were : 5, 5 (during first year), 8, 4, 5 (during second year),
for an average of 5.4 eggs per clutch.
The eggs are a pale blue colour, lighter than those of the Eastern
Bluebird. Maxima and minima recorded for the eggs of the above five
clutches were : 23.0 and 20.8 (length), and 18.6 and 17.0 mm. (dia-
meter).
Incubation
The incubation period lasted 13 days in one case and 15 days in
another. Only the hen incubates, but the cock may enter the box during
the lien's absence and may stay in for a time, leaving when she is ready

to re-enter. While in the box the male may poke at the grasses,
occasionally removing a blade or two, or he may perform cup-shaping
motions (which have been noted in wild males; see Murie, 1934). The
male does not warm the eggs, however.
I observed one female regularly during the incubation periods of her
first nests of two seasons, and her times spent on and off the nest were
recorded. She averaged 34.4 minutes on the nest each time she entered,
and 4.5 minutes off the nest each time she left. The corresponding
figures reported by Power (1966) for wild incubating birds were 25.6
and 7.0 minutes. Therefore the captive birds spent a greater percentage
of time on the eggs (88.4 percent) than did the wild birds (79.9 per-
cent). The percentage difference was accounted for equally by a 35.4
percent decrease in the average inattentive time, and a 34.4 percent
increase in the average attentive time. The captive birds had a con-
stantly available source of food and thus spent less time searching for
food while inattentive. The longer attentive periods are related to more
feedings of the incubating hen by the male (discussed below), which
may also be due to food availability.
The variation in time spent on and off the nest per trip is sum-
marized for the entire incubation period in Table I. While the total
percentage of time spent on the nest remains fairly constant (at 85 to
92 percent) throughout the incubation period, the average duration of
each increases until about midway through incubation, at which time
both level off and remain fairly constant thereafter. I should note that
the longest record of a single " sitting " occurred on day 8 (155.4 min-
utes), while the second longest record came on day 14(118.8 minutes).
Occasionally I would find the female on the eggs before the clutch

was completed. This happened during the day, as incubation at night
always began after the clutch was completed. For seven periods when
the female entered and left the nest before cessation of laying, her
attentive periods were near normal (averaging 25.0 minutes), but her
inattentive periods were often greatly prolonged.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999218209302325" page_id="56381312"  page_num="20" year="" vol="">
One other factor was found to influence the amount of time spent on
the nest per attentive period by the hen, namely the number of times
she was fed by her mate. If the female was not fed at all, she averaged
only 25.1 minutes on the nest; if fed once or twice, this increased to
41.6 minutes; finally, if she was fed three or more times (a maximum
of seven feedings during one sitting was recorded), she spent an average
of 78.5 minutes on (sample sizes for the three groups are, respectively,
56, 16, and 7).
It could be argued that the longer the female is on the nest, the more
likely the male is to feed her, and thus her sitting for a longer time
causes the male to feed her more instead of the converse. Evidence
against this is seen by the fact that the longest attentive period by the
hen when she was not fed was only 66.2 minutes, which is probably
near the maximum amount of time which she can go without food.
Moreover, the hen fed on practically every occasion when she left the
nest, often at once but sometimes pausing to stretch or scratch first.
Lack (1940) did not consider the possibility that courtship feeding may
increase the amount of time the female may spend on her eggs, but
that appears to be the case here.
Care of the Young
Both the male and female feed the young, although only the female
broods. Most of the grit required by the nestlings (small stones and bits
of egg shell were kept in the cages for this purpose) is supplied by the
female.
At one nest the hen spent 351 of 630 minutes (55.2 percent) brooding
during the first 48 hours after hatching; during the succeeding 48 hours
this decreased to 221.5 of 460 minutes (48.2 percent) and for the third
48 hour period 184.5 *f 46 1 minutes (40.0 percent) were spent brooding.
During this period the female increased the percentage of food which
she brought to the nestlings, although the male continued to supply
the greater amount of food. At the end of the first week I took charge
of the single nestling that remained, hoping that the adults would nest
again (they did, but not successfully). This was the closest I came to a
successful breeding of this species.
An unusual behaviour known as " tremble-thrusting " was described
for Eastern Bluebirds by Hartshorne (1962) and was also observed in
these Mountain Bluebirds. The female, in performing a tremble-thrust,
stands on the rim of the nest cup and forcefully vibrates her beak
against the floor of the box. In the Mountain Bluebird I noted this
behaviour late in incubation, but it becomes most common after the
young hatch. Its possible function is discussed by Pinkowski (1974), and
it would be interesting to know which Old World thrushes, if any,
perform tremble-thrusts.

behaviour of Eastern and Mountain Bluebirds permit hybridization
between the two species. The courtship displays of these species can be
readily analyzed because many relate to the nest cavity which is
necessarily an important element in the reproductive cycle of the two
species. Since the males of both species court females by various dis-
plays in and around potential nest sites, we would expect that these
displays would act as releasers bringing about subsequent nesting
activities in the females of both species.
Krieg (1971) has presented a complete and thorough analysis of the
courtship displays of the Eastern Bluebird. It is not surprising that
many of these are duplicated precisely by Mountain Bluebirds. These
include the following: (1) sexual chasing; (2) symbolic nest-building
(by the male); (3) butterfly flight (slow, unsteady flight to nest site by
male); (4) nest demonstration (male at nest entrance with blue back,
coloured similarly in both species, displayed); (5) various "sleek"
postures; (6) male calling while inside nest cavity, often while holding
food in bill; (7) copulation invitations (by the female), including
posture, movements, and calls; (8) wing-lifting and wing-waving; (9)
courtship-feeding; and (10) face showing (male looks out cavity en-
trance while inside).
The importance of these displays in permitting hybridization can be
realized when one considers the fact that the vocalizations of the two
species are remarkably dissimilar. Their primary songs are totally
unlike, and the location calls are only superficially alike. Alarm notes
in the Eastern Bluebird (a "chuck" or "chatter" and a "whine";
see Pinkowski 3 1971) do not even remotely resemble those of the
Mountain Bluebird (a higher-pitched " tink " being perhaps most com-
mon). Knowing this, it is hard to imagine how a hybrid would be
capable of functioning in either system.

By Ray Kyme (Kirton, Boston, Lincolnshire)
In the past three or four years several species of Indonesian parrots
have been reintroduced to aviculture, among them the Iris Lorikeet of
Timor and Wetar--a small island to the north of Timor. Timor is
sufficiently large an island (200 x 60 miles) to be subdivided politically
into two " halves " and a " bit ", between Portugal and Indonesia and
it lies about 180 miles to the north-west of Northern Australia. The
Varied Lorikeet P. versicolor of Australia and the Iris Lorikeet are so
very similar in general appearance that it is probably safe to assume
that they have diverged recently from one another. Forshaw (1973)
has put the member species of Psitteuteles into Trichoglossus. While not
denying that this is perfectly reasonable, there are some differences
shown between members of these two genera other than differences in
colour, which have led me to retain Psitteuteles. Mrs. Johnstone's Lori-
keet P. johnstoiiiae (Johnstone 1907) and the Varied Lorikeet (Forshaw
1969) have been reported to bring nesting material into the nest cham-
ber which is so both for the Yellow-and-Green Lorikeet P. flavoviridis
and the Iris Lorikeet (pers. obs.). The Psitteuteles lorikeets take seeds
as readily as they do nectar and Mr. G. A. Smith tells me that the
skulls of Psitteuteles lorikeets, because of the breadth of the upper
mandible, the roundness and structure of the skull, show some simi-
larity to lovebirds Agapornis and are not simply a smaller "version "
of a Trichoglossus skull. This might not be relevant were it not that
otherwise, except for size, one genus of brush-tongued parrots' skull is
exactly like another.

Iris Lorikeets are small, being about as big as the Abyssinian Love-
bird A. taranta but having a slightly longer tail than that bird. The
basic colour is green with a reddish bill and a red front extending back
into a cap. There is a spread of purple over the ears and the pale green
belly is cross-streaked with dark green. In the two fertile, and therefore
definite, pairs which I know (Mr. and Mrs. Bob Grantham have a
hand-tame pair) the male is slightly larger with a bolder head and the
red cap is larger and more brightly coloured. The difference isn't par-
ticularly well defined and for quickness I find myself looking at the
feet, for my hen lacks some toenails.
Breeding
In January 1973 I bought four freshly imported birds, one of which
died very shortly afterwards with aspergillosis. They were kept in
cages in an unheated birdroom until the end of April when the two
which looked to be a pair were put into a small aviary measuring
8x3x6 feet high. They were provided with a natural log which was
almost immediately inspected by both birds and used as a dormitory
at night. The nectar mixture contains Farex--a baby cereal, con-
densed milk, honey, Vitamin B12, yeast mixture in water; sunflower
seed is also provided. They also have a slice of apple and some spinach
beet daily. Food is held in the foot as a hand.
Courtship display is mutual. They bow the head down and hiss
through the open bill. During bowing the feathers over the shoulders
are raised. Perhaps the male is slightly more demonstrative in the dis-
play than the female; certainly he is the dominant character and
bickering fights are very frequent. The male was seen to pair with the
hen several times mounting with both feet. I have not seen the female
feed the male and most feeding did in fact take place inside the nest.
The first egg was laid on the 28th June and the second on the 1st
July. The egg that hatched did so on the 23rd--the other was infertile.
The chick grew well but died on the 21st August; it was not subjected
to a post-mortem examination and the cause of death remains obscure.
No further signs of nesting were shown that year.
They wintered in the aviary and continued to sleep inside the log
at nights which protected them from the weather; otherwise I would
have brought them indoors. They next nested on the 4th May, 1974,
the second egg being laid on the 6th, the eggs hatching on the 27th
and 29th May--a 23-day incubation period. During incubation the
female could be heard frequently calling the male to feed her. Iris
Lorikeets are very fond of soft fruit and the youngsters were probably
mostly reared on raspberries, indeed they ate these at such a rate that
my wife had trouble salvaging enough for the house and jam-making.
The chicks left the nest on the 2nd August at 65 and 67 days old. A
few days before this they were seen in the nest by Mr. Ken Russell and

after they fledged by Mr. G. A. Smith. Like most baby lories they were
a little feather plucked by the parents on emerging but these feathers
were soon made good.
The chicks are smaller, duller and have black beaks which makes
them easy to separate from the parents.
They returned to the nest the same day as they left it and have so
far always gone back inside when the weather is unfavourable. The
parents have not re-nested. Both parents and young regularly water-
bathe, I have not seen them sun-bathe, or rain-bathe. Mrs. Rosemary
Grantham tells me of a pair which, when on the ground, alternately
jump up and down so that as one is up the other is down. I have not
seen this in my own birds and have only seen jumping in males of other
species of parrot and these two birds could therefore be males.
One very good point of the Iris Lorikeet is the fact they are not
noisy birds, in fact they are the least noisy of all the lories I have kept
and I might say I have kept a few, thanks to a very good friend.

THE SPOTTED MORNING WARBLER
Cichladusa guttata

<bodyText confidence="0.974986636363636" page_id="56381308"  page_num="24" year="" vol="">
The November-December, 1973, Magazine contained two accounts
of the breeding of the Spotted Morning Warbler, Cichladusa guttata;
one at Birdland, Bourton-on-the-Water and the other at Winged World.
Two colour photographs illustrate the Birdland account; one shows the
top of the head of a bird in its deep mud nest, the other a short-tailed,
immature bird, though this is not made clear by the caption.
My drawing portrays an adult Spotted Morning Warbler in a typical
stance, while these notes attempt to add a little more information
about the species. The second account mentioned above gives the size
of the species and a good description of the colours, and lists its distri-
bution in eastern Africa, but does omit Somalia.

I know this bird from Kenya, although I have seen it only rarely,
for it is a shy, skulking species. It spends much of the day in thick
scrub, occasionally leaving to feed from the ground below. Where I
have seen it, the country has been covered with thick, fairly low thorn
scrub, and has been very hot and dry for most of the year.
Williams (1972) describes it as a common bird of the semi-desert
areas of northern Kenya and adds that it also inhabits palm tree scrub
and dense coastal bush.
A few years ago, while I was staying beside Lake Baringo, at the
home of Mrs. Betty Roberts, a Spotted Morning Warbler used to sing
regularly early each morning from the cover of a small thorn bush
close to the house; the species also sings at dusk.
Mackworth-Praed and Grant (1957) and Williams mention that it
mimics the calls and songs of other birds, without stating which these
are. I sought the opinion of Tim Barnley of Kitale, Kenya, who kindly
replied that the species it mimics vary in different localities. For West
Pokot to Lake Baringo, which is an area he knows better than anyone
and is where the warblers in this country originate from, he suggests--
Red-chested, Emerald and Klaas's Cuckoos, Lizard Buzzard, Pale
Chanting Goshawk, Madagascar Bee-eater, Freckled Nightjar, White-
browed Robin Ghat and Black-headed Oriole, plus some snatches of
sub-song from various sparrow-weavers and finches, etc.
The drawing was made from a bird at London Zoo. This bird lives
in an indoor aviary which houses mostly small seed-eaters. Although it
is considerably bigger than most of its companions, I have never noticed
any aggressive behaviour from it. I would, however, expect it to react
differently to other thrush-like birds. It arrived from Kenya during
1968 and was the first of its genus, containing three species, to be
represented in the collection.

DUIVENBODE'S LORY Chalcopsitta duyvenbodei duyvenbodei
[Dubois)
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.935848025" page_id="56381275"  page_num="26" year="" vol="">
This species was named after Maarten Dirk van Renesse van Duiven-
bode (1832 or 1833-1881 or 1882) who, together with his son, Lodewijk
Diederik Hendrik Alexander, ran flourishing trading enterprises and
plantations at Ternate, Moluccas and Manado, Celebes. This trading
partnership handled large numbers of bird skins collected in the East
Indies. Many were destined for the French millinery trade, but it
would appear that notable collections were also presented to museums;
Leyden and the Belgian Royal Natural History Museum in particular.
It would seem that a collection of skins from this source was pre-
sented to the Belgian Royal Natural History Museum in 1883 or 1884
and the describer, M. Alph. Dubois, decided to dedicate this new
species to Duivenbode the elder, although inexplicably Dubois quotes
the initials M.C.W.R. for Duivenbode : this fits neither father nor son.

Distribution
Northern coast of western New Guinea between the Mamberano
and Tami Rivers.
Description--Measurements
Length io in. Wing 6S in.
Coloration
Predominantly the colour of this species is dark olive brown. The
feathering of the lores and bordering the base of the bill is golden
yellow. The lanceolate neck feathers are also golden yellow towards;
their tips and along the centre. The outer surface of the primary and
secondary wing feathers is black; the undersides of these feathers are
gold shading to dark chocolate at the tips. The lower part of the back
and rump are violet blue. The basal areas of the breast feathering are
yellow and this gives the impression of a golden suffusion on the breast.
The upper surface of the tail is deep purple and the underside golden
olive. The naked areas of skin adjacent to eyes and bill are blue. The
bill, cere and feet are greyish black.
Ornithology
As with so many species of lory, I can find very little first hand
information recorded about its habits in the wild. It is said to only be
moderately common throughout its range and is encountered in pairs
or small parties of between six and eight individuals, these usually being

observed in the forest canopy.
Aviculture
The first record that I can trace of a living example of this species
reaching Europe is that of a single bird imported by Mr. J. Spedan
Lewis in November 1929, this lory was presented to the London Zoo-
logical Society. Shortly after this Mr. St. Alban Smith obtained three
Duivenbode's Lories in Singapore; two were presented to the London
Zoological Society and the third was sent to Mr. Herbert Whitley's
collection at Primley Park, Paignton.
It would seem that this species remained an extreme avicultural
rarity until 1972 but since then small groups have been imported
regularly; however it is still uncommon and commands high prices.
It is to be hoped that our members who now have this attractive lory
represented in their collections, will submit papers on the behaviour,
display and idiosyncrasies to this magazine, as to date very little
detailed information is recorded.

During 1971 I had some very interesting experiences with Rollers.
My journal for the 23rd May of that year contains this brief entry :
" Bought Roller, one adult in superb condition as part of a job
(trapper's) lot. Placed it in a roomy cage whereupon it immediately
took all the mealworm beetles. Subsequently it took mealworms and
pupae. Trapper says it takes worms, so I dug up a few large ones and
gave these along with chopped chicken livers all rolled up in Sluis
Universal. All food taken."
The next month the same trapper brought a brood of nestlings to
me. I had doubts about the morality of accepting them, but, as every
aviculturist knows, the desire for ownership frequently overcomes
common sense. A second brood turned up a few days later and I knew
for sure that I should have been stronger. I took the second brood,
making loud and strong noises that I would not take any more. I was
offered more of course, but managed to refuse. This man carefully and
expertly hand-reared three further broods and only managed to sell ;
them with great difficulty when they were feeding independently. He
has never taken any more Rollers--and my conscience is a little easier
now.
My journal entries were precise and detailed, and are repeated here
on the off chance that they may be a help to somebody at some time.
" 18th June, 1971.
Received three babies; 1st very small, eyes closed, naked; 2nd twice as big,
naked, eyes closed but fractionally open at times; 3rd a little bigger, a few
rows of pinheads showing, able to open eyes about half-way.
19th.
Smallest died. The larger, named A, weighed 2 oz., while B weighed 1 oz.
Fed them on Beechnut brand high protein baby food from jars, by means of a
hypodermic syringe. This food had some scraped cuttlefish bone added, plus a
few drops of Abidec multivitamin. I also gave a few mealworms from time to
time. At each feed I give a pellet of minced raw lean beef mixed with fresh
cream cheese.

Both birds growing very well and satisfactorily. Eyes are open. A is showing
a lot of pinheads and tiny paintbrushes, while B is just beginning to. They seem
to be 2 days apart in age, which would make them respectively 2, 4 and 6 days

suppose the parents must have fed a lot of the giant black Spanish Bumblebees.
The cloth lining the box has to be replaced every two hours.
27th.
E found dead this morning. Obviously taken too young. Sorry. Have my
doubts about D now.
29th.
A very active now (could be 15 days old). Yesterday I put him on the table
top beside the nest box and he climbed back in through the hole. This morning
he is walking around his box pecking at things, following flies with quite rapid
movements of his head. I think that he would peck at one if it came within
reach. All the nestlings attempt to preen themselves. A raises head feathers a
lot, stretches wings, etc. . . . Feeding today Beechnut with rice, spiced with
powdered cuttlefish and mashed hard-boiled egg. I give mealworms. They cope
with these easily; the skins occasionally show up in the droppings but very soft
and pulpy and completely squeezed out. Am also giving minced meat, flies,
beetles, mealworm pupae and beetles. All four recognise me personally, and the
syringe. Today separated A and B from G and D since the latter two frequently
seemed to be squashed and browbeaten, especially D.
30th.
D has put on a lot of weight and his feathers have broken through at last.
1 st July.
All four preen regularly, scratch their heads with their feet over the wing
(which an older Magpie seems not to be able to do yet). Menu today is Beech-
nut, mixed vegetables with liver, mixed with minced meat, calcium, hard-
boiled egg.
6th.
At today's weigh-in I noticed that A and B had greenish crowns and yellowish
feet. G has a brownish sheen to its blue crown, while D is just regular blue.
Both C and D had pink feet as babies. Food today Gerber powder (' 5 cereals
with Vitamins ') mixed to a stiff paste with water, mixed with chopped hard
boiled egg and cream cheese.
Easy to tell the birds by size and head colour.
7th. a.m.
Brownhead (C) sitting fluffed up and miserable today. Most unsettling. No
weight gain. D not looking too bright either.
p.m. A jumped out of the box this afternoon, yodelling quite a lot. Birds
enjoy looking out of box, all around. All four preen quite well. Food same as
yesterday funnily enough both Magpie and Crow hate it, and spit it out!).
9 th.
Yodelling calls quite clear now, mainly from A and B. Only happens when
hungry--i.e. 2 to 3 hours after a feeding. Lot of wing flapping. No doubt that
in the wild by now these birds would be on the sticks outside the nest, at least
A and B would be. A and B identical body size but A has tail 1 cm. longer.
Both have greenish head and whitish lores and supercilium. G is definitely more
brownish on the crown and the throat is more striated. I would have to group
D with A and B. G is more retiring, and hides under the others if alarmed.
Compared with the adults (by then I had three) they are about half adult
size. I estimate that their respective ages are probably around:

However, to look at them A, B, G now look identical in size, with D only a
little bit smaller. So far no attempt by any bird to fly. Today's menu was
Gerber plus egg, * Dayamineral' , minced meat, and a Ivunp of cheese each.
Droppings are perfectly normal and free from smell. I give a few drops of water
two or three times each day now, this is appreciated and is taken eagerly.
10th.
Came down to find one bird missing. I had left them on the kitchen table.
It had got out, flown to the sink and on seeing me howled for food.
15th.
The four young Rollers are now kept in a large all-wire flight cage on a table
in the garden. A escaped today causing a great deal of trouble. He called all
the time yodelling like a Green Woodpecker (the Spanish name for the species
is Carraca, which also means rattle or clacker). I placed one of the adults in the
cage with the three remaining youngsters in the hope that it might be stimu-
lated to call, and this might strike a responsive chord in the breast of the
prodigal. The adult ignored the three immatures, pecking irritably at them if
they got in the way, and in any case was too big for the cage. While I was
returning it to the birdroom the wanderer returned. A is a very capable flyer,
with no sign of weakness or ineptitude.
Each of these four has its own individual character. A is adventurous, highly
strung, and will fly off readily unless newly fed and content. B is placid and
can't be bothered to fly even when all the conditions seem right, and he rarely
bothers to call for food. C is a great yacker, equal to A but very nervous and
always trying to escape from me, and generally seems unhappy in a cage. D is
the smaller one. His plumage is slightly barred all over suggesting perhaps an
irregular diet. He is very steady, dislikes gaping but swallows well. He yacks
also, but in a high falsetto.
The legs of all four birds are now yellowish.
18 th.
A escaped again, and I returned at breakneck speed across a sleepy summer-
time Madrid to attempt rescue. It apparently flew off determinedly but was
located at the top of a very tall pine tree in the next door garden. Flew to our
(flat) roof top above the studio, across to weather cock on house opposite. Each
time it obviously selected a perch that afforded a fine all-round view. I settled
myself down upon the studio roof, three floors up) and called to it. It was
rattling a great deal, and as hunger became more acute the calls obviously
became louder and more frequent. The behaviour between this fledgling and
the other birds being hand-reared at this time was most noticeable. The young
Magpie and Carrion Grow (both free flying by now) would come instantly in
response to my call. The distance made no difference, as long as they heard me.
They would both happily follow me about, exploring what I appeared to be
doing, and instantly begging if what I was up to appeared in any way to be
associated with food.
The passive attention-calling behaviour of the Rollers was in marked contrast,
and very frustrating for me. After an hour and a half--during which time I
nearly cooked alive on the open roof (it was ioo* F. in the shade)--I crouched
hidden below the parapet and managed to call the Roller over. It landed on
the wall and while still yacking for food was grabbed."
That completes the notes in my journal, apart from a calendar of
weights which is as follows :
Weighing at 11 o'clock every evening (in ounces).

At this point I gave up weighing them. However, for comparative
purposes I weighed the three adult Rollers--and each weighed more or
less 5 ozs., and they were strong, healthy birds.
Unfortunately I do not have details on the weaning off period. I
remember placing a large bowl with grasshoppers, mealworms and
beetles in the cage and these were eventually sampled. Soft food in the
shape of small lumps of chicken meat, balls of minced meat and every-
thing mixed with soft food was eventually taken. The birds passed into
the hands of an ASPEBA member, but no news of them since.
A final note on feeding the adults. These birds w r ere given a dozen
or so mealworms each day, plus a dozen or so locusts or crickets (the
size of your thumb, and they bite !) plus a few regular grasshoppers and
and anything else I could find that moved. They w r ould take earth-
worms, and eventually meat balls in Sluis insectile food. On one
occasion--for three days- -I had no mealworms and the car was out
of action; also no locusts (I drove 13 miles out into the country every
morning at 5.30 in the morning, to spend 30 minutes frantically swatt-
ing still-cold insects). I had to hand-feed raw ox heart and chicken
liver, plus minced meat balls (laced with everything). Two of these
birds took this fare willingly, but one had to be force-fed.
Conclusions

rearing Rollers and crows. Another difference well worth taking into
account is the method of nest sanitation. A young crow will take food,
then turn and offer its tail-end to its benefactor, neatly extruding a
waste sac. The Roller has no such refinement. The nest is obviously
kept clean by the nestlings reversing towards the light source (entrance
hole) and when the wall of the nest touches the raised abdomen the
excreta is ejected under high pressure. In the wild this would be very
efficient. In a posh executive's office in an international advertising
agency it is less suitable!
Rollers are fairly passive birds, not really suitable for cages or small
aviaries, I have no doubt that an ideal aviary would be quite long with
simple perching at either end and plenty of grassy tanglegrowth in
between. The function of this latter would be to shelter and encourage
the grasshoppers, etc. that ought to be thrown in at regular intervals.
This would encourage natural behaviour and enable the gorgeous
colouring of the birds in flight to be seen to advantage.
" Meating-off 55 is not too difficult, but I suspect that natural food-
seeking behaviour may be linked to breeding behaviour and maturing
of sex glands.

Canary Islands Interlude
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99913024" page_id="56381281"  page_num="32" year="" vol="">
During my time in Spain, I managed to get two week-long
business trips to the Canary Islands. Whilst this might at first sound
marvellous, I have to relate that my foot never touched a beach!
However, the opportunities of touring around with a salesman on
several occasions meant that I was able to visit the markets, find all
the pet shops and more. On both Tenerife and Gran Canaria I
managed to find a salesman who was also a bird fancier.
If the reader is intent on taking a holiday on either of these islands,
he should know beforehand that the pet shops only sell domesticated
species (mostly the Spanish breeds of Canary) and imported birds,
mostly from Africa. However, they do buy South American birds that
are often smuggled in by sailors. The most sought after and the most
expensive are the Cardenal or Cardenalito --or Hooded Red Siskin as
we would call it (Carduelis cucullatus). In the markets, however, the
scene is quite different. The most popular cage bird is the Goldfinch
and several dealers make a good living by selling them. Do not be
misled into thinking that these may be the Canary Islands race; oh!
that they were. No, they are definitely imported from the Spanish
peninsula.
I tried very hard to find the local race. Eventually, in the homes of
two fanciers, I found in each a single old male. The local subspecies is
larger (though not as large as the Siberian race) and noticeably darker.
The Spanish " race 55 incidentally is marginally smaller and brighter
than the British bird. The Goldfinch in the Canaries has been so
popular for so long that it has been trapped almost into extinction.

Another species that has all but disappeared on the islands, thanks to
the trapping, is the Linnet. It is not imported from the peninsula and
has achieved a status locally of almost legendary proportions. I was
told breathlessly of one man who still had one (I did not recognize it by
name, and the word description led me to expect a seed-eating
Redbreast-Nightingale), which turned out to be the oldest, saddest,
long-toenailed finch I had ever seen.
A bird that the observant visitor cannot fail to come across is
RhocLopechys (. Bucanetes) githaginea, the Trumpeter Bullfinch. Single
males are kept in cages hanging in the doorways of shops and, for some
reason, seem to be a favourite of greengrocers. These birds are usually
cage-moulted and have lost the lovely soft pinky-grey plumage and
reddish flush of the wild bird; instead they are an even dull, dark warm
grey. The heavy vermilion bill, however, remains unchanged. These
birds are invariably fascinating characters and will respond to a finger
poked through the wire by fluffing out, lowering wings and charging,
butting the offending digit fiercely.
Enquiries for the Camachuelo Trompetero (the name in Spanish
books) will draw blank looks. Each island has its own set of names.
The commonest is Moro which could mean either "Moor" (being a
bird of the desert like the Moors) or " large bill ". During my travels,
I was taken to the home of a wily old fancier who had a couple of
males that he was keeping in order to cross them with Canary females.
The fanciers there rank the value of wild finches strictly according to
their ability to produce Canary hybrids. These two birds were cage-
moulted and were the dull grey of the birds that I'd already seen in the
greengrocers' shops. I was able to buy them at a fair price and must
admit to having felt rather elated. My friend, Herbert Murray, once
told me that he had always had a longing to try the species and I
promised to look out for it for him. Some two years later, Herbert
admitted that they were nothing like the image that he had cherished.
A few days later I visited the market at the airport end of Las
Palmas where we met a Goldfinch seller called Senor Delgado who
admitted to having some Moros at home. Apparently it is forbidden to
offer wild birds for sale during the breeding season, which is why he
had not brought them with him. That afternoon, we drove out some
42 kilometres to a finca in the middle of a banana plantation. Here,
Sr. Delgado's father lived alone, looking after a collection of, he
claimed, some 3,000 birds.
It was easily the most astonishing collection of birds that I have ever
seen. There were hardly any regular flights as we would recognise them,
but every courtyard, patio, terrace, veranda and alleyway had been
covered with wire mesh and partitioned off. There were birds of many
kinds from every continent and often in rather bizarre mixtures--
Gannet, Golden Pheasant and Black Kite for instance. I was led

through a labyrinth of on-joining aviaries, some having flights over
others, until we came to one containing local finches. In it were the
pair of Spanish Sparrows (see A.M. vol. 80, p. 4) which I have already
written about, together with a beautiful pair of Trumpeter Bullfinches.
These two birds bore no resemblance to the others; they were per-
haps marginally smaller and a lovely clean, richly washed fawn. The
male was quite reddish. The bills were more vermilion than scarlet. I
managed to get these four birds back to England where, not surpris-
ingly, the two paler birds were taken for hens and divided. One each
to go with one each of the grey males. The female went off to Dr.
Harrison who managed to breed them in a cage and the two odd males
to Mr. Murray. Colin Harrison bred a young male, whereupon the
female died, so, if any reader knows the whereabouts of a female
Trumpeter, please let either of these gentlemen know.
For the interested reader, I can say that the two older birds were
very like the Heinzel plate in the Collins' Guide, while the lighter pair
were like Barruel's illustration in Etchecopar and Flue's birds of north
AFRICA.
I found all four very easy to maintain in singing condition in a 7 ft.
indoor flight cage. There was no fighting between the three males over
the one female, neither was there any squabbling with their com-
panions (Wild Canaries, Serins, Short-toed Larks). They seemed to be
content with a commercial canary mixture and millet seeds : in the
islands, they seem to be fed simply on millet.
In the same aviary as the sparrows and bullfinches were a pair of
Teydea Chaffinches. These are the most beautiful birds and guaranteed
to set any finch specialist afire with enthusiasm. Sr. Delgado would not
part with them; he had trapped them especially to breed with, he said.
He offered to let me have them later in the year or he would get some
more for me.
It is not easy to find the Wild Canary in the Islands. All the pet
shops will attempt to sell a green marked domestic canary as the real
thing. However, one can nearly always buy one or two in the open
market. The sum total of my two visits, combing the markets and
tempting fanciers to spare the odd bird, was five pairs. Included
among these was an old male in paranoic full song, who had success-
fully paired to a female Belgian Fancy of all varieties, and an adult
female that had been reared by a domestic female--a clutch having
been taken from the wild. On one of my flying trips to London in
August 1973, I was able to take four pairs over for ASPEBA study,
keeping one pair for myself. Accidentally, I chose the wrong male,
leaving myself with a very well coloured, but too young bird to pair
with the old female. Frank Meaden kept a pair for himself and the
other three pairs were distributed, so come on you ASPEBA members,
let's -hear how things went! (ASPEBA is, of course, the Association for

The Canary Islanders are very much against taking Wild Canaries
during the breeding season. They maintain that they are more sensitive
and delicate and, unless the pair is taken, a single bird will die of
sadness. Whatever the reason may be I am sure that there is something
in this, for it is true of Serins.
The old female that I kept built a fine nest and laid three clutches,
sitting on each until about the 16th day before becoming restless and
unhappy. They naturally breed in January to March in the Islands,
according to the locals (I have not confirmed this with Bannerman),
so if my male was a bird of the year, it was unlikely to be more than
six months old. It sang little and feebly.
Among the interesting birds in Sr. Delgado's collection was a Canary
Island Corn Bunting. This bird was the size of a saltator; it was
enormous and browner than our British bird : apparently it is extremely
rare there. He also had a lot of Lesser Short-toed Larks. Unfortunately,
these lovely little birds, which become inordinately tame very quickly,
had been kept in a long flight with seed-eaters and had no soft food
at all. They also had their feet balled with collected mud and drop-
pings from the concrete floor of their enclosure. It was not easy to tell
an old man, who was successfully keeping an incredible amount of
birds alive, that he was doing something wrong. He just laughed at me
and told me not to worry.

By J. Delacour (Cleres, Seine Maritime, France)
The weather was again very unusual in western Europe during 1974.
After a very mild winter and a warm, sunny early spring, it turned cold
and dry early in April and this disagreeable period lasted well into
June. It was at last replaced by rains and warmer weather at the end
of that month. July and August were mild and not too dry, but a chilly
rain started in mid-September and continued till the end of the autumn.
It made it all very difficult with tropical birds. It was, however, good to
witness the end of a four years' drought and to see once more springs
flow normally, for it put a term to our anxiety over the wintering of
our flamingoes. Never since 1920 have we had to take them in during
the winters, not even the coldest ones. They are really indifferent to
cold, but they cannot stand ice, as they must have access to open
water. So far we always had a sufficient flow to keep the river and
most of the lake partly unfrozen, but a combination of a drought and of
cold weather could have been fatal. The return of normal moist
conditions has greatly relieved us of our worries.

j. DELAGOUR-NOTES FROM GLERES AND BRAZIL
The exceptional chilliness of the spring resulted in very poor breed-
ing results with many tropical species. Usually reliable breeders such as
touracous, various ground pigeons, Fairy Bluebirds and Superb Spreos ;
failed to rear their broods. Splendid Glossy Starlings, however, raised
two young, the first bom in captivity to our knowledge. There were
also four Kookaburras and five Orange-headed Thrushes.
Pheasants and waterfowl were only moderately successful. A pair
of Bare-faced Gurassows produced three chicks in two broods, first two
females, then a male. Sexes can be recognised very early, as the females
immediately grow heavily barred feathers.
We had no Rheas, most of the eggs being infertile, but we raised
28 Emus from two pairs.
We did fairly well with cranes. One pair of Saras gave us four young
in three clutches of two, one and two eggs. Two pairs of Dark
pavonina Crowned Cranes laid three eggs each, their normal clutch,
and four young were reared as well as one Demoiselle. So far only one
pair of Dark Crowned Cranes had nested each year in July. The last
two years these birds had driven away from their territory (about six
acres of a meadow south of the lake) the other two pairs of Dark and
three pairs of Grey Crowned Cranes regulorum living with them in
the park, as soon as they began to breed. Another pair of pavonina
laid this year, for the first time, before them : they made their nest
along the garden fence, in short grass, but they never bothered other
cranes. Soon the old pair started nesting as usual in large clumps of
water irises, about nine hundred feet to the west, and they in turn did
not drive others away as they had done the two previous years. It all
went on very peacefully. One has difficulties in understanding and
interpreting certain birds' behaviour as it changes from year to year.
All our young cranes are hatched in an incubator and hand-reared,
each separately until fully developed, as they will fight savagely until
some six months old.
I was in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 12th November till 3rd Decem-
ber, 1974, enjoying the hospitality of my old friend Dr. E. P. Beraut as
well as his beautiful tropical birds and plants. His collection of rare
insectivorous, frugivorous and nectar-feeding birds continues to be
excellent. He keeps large numbers of them, but not to the point of
overcrowding his numerous, well planted aviaries. There are some rare
parrots, and waders roam his garden; also herons, ibises, trumpeters,
cranes and flamingoes. Mr. C. Cordier had recently brought him
species from Bolivia, particularly three Blue-eyed Cocks of the Rock
Rupicola peruviana saturata and several Sappho Plummingbirds
Sappho sparganura, resplendent with their long, metallic scarlet, forked
tails. Many species of manakins, some trogons and jacamars are par-
ticularly attractive and there are also Old World birds such as sunbirds,

kingfishers and birds of paradise. I particularly noticed two unusual
Brazilian cuckoos of great interest: a tame, hand-reared Squirrel
Cuckoo Piaya cayana and a large, beautiful Ground Cuckoo Neomor -
phns geoffroyi from the state of Bahia, a very scarce bird of the
vanishing primeval forests. It was interesting to realise how close they
are in shape, ways and behaviour to the Indo-Malayan cuckoos of the
genus Phoenicophaeus.
It was, as always, a treat to inspect the collection of Mr. Mario
Ventura. His numerous tanagers, sugarbirds, manakins, hummingbirds
and other local difficult species are in perfect condition and seem to live
for ever in their rather small, but very well sheltered and cosy aviaries.
He also keeps in cages certain seed-eaters for their song or their
abnormal plumage.
We saw two fine collections of pheasants in the vicinity of Rio,
belonging to Mr. Arthur Ribeiro and to Mr. Antonio Bretta. The
tropical species do well in the warm Brazilian climate. It is regrettable
that so few of the South American game birds, curassows and guans,
are kept in their own countries.
There are some excellent private collections of parrots and parrakeets
at Sao Paulo, where many South American as well as other species are
reared. We saw remarkable lutino conures Aratinga acuticauda and
A. auricapilla, which have retained the pink wash that underlies the
bluish parts of the normal green plumage. There is also a beautiful
hybrid Hyacinthine x Green-winged Macaw, with well defined, hand-
some dark blue, green and deep scarlet markings. Any ornithologist,
had he found such a bird in the wild state, would have not hesitated to
describe it as a new species!
The Sao Paulo Zoo continues to develop and both accommodation
and collection have still improved a great deal since my last visit four
years ago; they are altogether spectacular and interesting.
A visit to Iguagu Falls, as a guest of Dr. Autuori, the Zoo director,
proved once more highly enjoyable. The largest and finest waterfalls in
the world, they remain utterly unspoilt, as they are situated in the
middle of large national parks, both in Brazil and in Argentina. Birds
are numerous in the neighbourhood and it was all the more delightful
that an excellent hotel has been built since my visit there 16 years ago.

1974 has been a mixed year as far as breeding results are concerned.
This is due not so much to the weather as to the fact that we are con-
centrating on rearing the more valuable and therefore the less
commonly bred.
Much as we would like to breed every species of bird on the place,
it is just not possible without increasing the staff and then the whole
thing becomes economically out of the question.
It is a pity, but that is the situation today. In spite of this we do
rear a limited number of the commoner pheasants and waterfowl,
largely to keep up the numbers of those at liberty.
Parrots now outnumber other groups at Rode, both in individuals
and species, and our stock of macaws now includes six breeding pairs
and about a dozen non-breeders, mainly immature home-bred birds.
Practically all these are liberty day fliers trained to return to their
respective aviaries at night. The adult pairs cannot always all be let
out together, especially when breeding, and the keepers have to use
their discretion as to who flies with who. Once they have settled down
for the season and established their flight lines, most of them get on
quite well.
The immatures are the best show as they fly in groups and don't
quarrel so much; the old pairs tend to stick together and fly less
frequently.
This year we have reared eleven young macaws which I should think
must be a record numerically, at any rate for this country. These con-
sist of six Blue and Yellow from two pairs and five Scarlet from two
pairs. Another pair of Blue and Yellow and one pair of Green-winged
only produced infertile eggs.
Our old original breeding pair of Blue and Yellow had three, making
their grand total 23 in nine years.
Greater Patagonian Conures reared only one young one which was
attacked by the others the moment it left the nest, and had to be
removed. My wife took it over and under her care it has become an
affectionate if noisy pet. It takes daily flights round the garden and
returns to her wrist when called, as well behaved as a trained falcon.
Incidentally, these birds have a remarkably hawk-shaped silhouette
when in flight.
Patagonian Conures are such friendly and intelligent characters that
I had long cherished the notion of letting our colony of nine fly at
day liberty. Accordingly a special trap section was designed in part of
their aviary so that one bird at a time could be released and could
return without letting the others out. I was thankful that we took this

precaution, for the first one out made two circuits round the tree tops,
disappeared and was located two days later 60 miles away! So much
for that dream! Colony breeding with these birds is not a success. They
seem to agree well enough but only one or two pairs actually lay and
the young are attacked by the others as soon as they leave the nest.
The original pair--the parents of the colony--reared three or four
young each year when kept on their own.
Leadbeater's Cockatoos have been disappointing; the old pair reared
one young one---a poor effort after their earlier years when they used
to raise three at a time. A home-bred hen mated to an unrelated cock
laid an egg from the perch for the first time this year and she must be
five or six years old.
Roseate Cockatoos have done nothing since the old breeding hen
died several years ago. We kept a number of her progeny but after
years of trying to get them to breed I have reluctantly come to the con-
clusion that they are all cocks, even though the eyes of some of them
are a shade browner than those of others.
Citron-crested, and Umbrella Cockatoos laid but failed to rear. At
last I think we have managed to obtain a hen Moluccan; at any rate
she has a small head and dark brown eyes, but she is very shy and wild
and will, I fear, take some time to settle down.
We have managed to acquire from different sources two specimens
of the Spectacled Amazon Parrot. I had hoped that they might be a
pair but as they took little notice of each other to begin with I had my
doubts; however, they have more recently been seen preening each
other so I may well be wrong.
1974 has been the year of the long-legged birds; we have reared
three Sarus Cranes, a Demoiselle Crane, a White Stork, a Little Egret
and two Sacred Ibises. The cranes were all reared under bantams and
there seems little doubt that this is the best way to do it.
The parent birds incubate the eggs well enough but from then on
are hopeless. They refuse to feed their chicks artificial food and conse-
quently in their ceaseless search for insects they walk them about too
much and don't seem to have the sense to protect them when it rains.
Last year the Sarus hatched two young but lost them in this way
when they were about ten days old. This year they again hatched both
eggs and all went well for a few days when one chick was seen to be
failing, so it was taken away and put under a brooder lamp with a
broody bantam for company. It soon recovered and from then on never
looked back whereas the chick which we left with the parent cranes
died a few days later after a heavy shower of rain.
Within a few weeks the old birds had laid again and this time we let
them sit out their time and transferred the eggs to a bantam when
they were on the point of hatching. The result was one chick success-
fully hatched and reared.

D. H. S. RISDON-THE TROPICAL BIRD GARDENS, 1 974
Surprisingly the old birds laid yet a third time and again using the
same technique we have reared a fine youngster, so we have ended up
with more than we should have had even if the parent Sarus had
reared their first two chicks.
One of our pairs of Demoiselle Cranes laid their two eggs on the
bare ground under a large chestnut tree without even an apology for
a nest. Since it was in a spot where people walk about, we wired off
the whole area and the birds settled down to incubate steadily. Wp
adopted the same procedure as with the Sarus; one chick hatched and
has been reared without trouble.
It was interesting to note that after the first few days the little cranes
slept by the side of their foster mothers rather than under them. The
heat of the brooder lamp seemed to be sufficient and the bantam
provided company more than anything else.
There was no trouble in getting the chicks to take artificial food;
it was offered from the fingers initially and they soon cottoned on and &apos;
learned to pick it from the ground. Maggots and earthworms were
used at first to attract their attention and after a while they picked up
the worms themselves as the soil was turned with a spade. From then
on they were no trouble; they grow at a fantastic rate, seeming to put
on inches daily, and we have ended the season with some really beauti-
ful steady young birds as big as their parents.
Our Crowned Cranes raised our hopes by mating and going through
the motions of nest-building but that was as far as they got.
The White Storks actually hatched three chicks, as I reported earlier,
but two disappeared after a week or so. The remaining one is a fine
young bird and its beak and legs are now (October) slowly turning
from black to red.
There were five storks in the enclosure and all had always got on
well. In fact another pair nested close by the breeding pair although
they never actually laid and there was never any trouble until the
young one was ready to leave the nest, when the parents turned on the
others. Before it was realised what was happening they drove one of
them so that it became wedged between two fences where it must have
died of shock; the other two were rescued in time.
Sacred Ibises reared two; Scarlet Ibises were disappointing, for they
had several nests and young were heard calling but none were reared.
Four Grey Peacock Pheasants were reared and some Swinhoe's
Pheasants. Malayan Argus Pheasants raised our hopes when the hen
laid one egg in April, but that was all she did; the egg was infertile.
Among the waterfowl, Emperor, Lesser Whitefront, Barnacle and
Bar-headed Geese were reared, as well as Mandarin, Carolina, Red-
crested Pochard, Pintails and Australian Wood Duck (Maned Geese).
An interesting pair of new arrivals this year have been the African
Ground Hornbills. At a distance these large black birds remind one of

In 1972, the Berlin Zoo obtained two Laughing Kingfishers Dacelo
novaeguineae (gigas) and these were put with a single bird already
in the collection, all three being put into an outdoor cage at the bird
house. This cage measures 4.70 m. long, 3.00 m. wide and 2.70 rn.
high and faces south. The ground area is mostly of grass with a small
pool and there is a single perch and a stout branched tree. There are
two tree stumps in the aviary, one hollow. The birds are fed on a soft
food (also given to pheasants) minced horseflesh, once weekly minced
beef, heart cut into small pieces, mice, naked baby rats, sparrows
cut into pieces, small fish, mealworms and sometimes a vitamin com-
pound and Vita-Kalk.
In 1974 the kingfishers began to breed and chose the hollow tree
for a nesting place. In June three white eggs were laid, but these
were infertile. They weighed 20, 24 and 25 g. and were 4.5 x 3.6 cm.
in size.
In July another clutch of three was laid and after an incubation
period of 27 days there hatched on the 22nd, 23rd and 25th of August
three grey-coloured chicks that were well cared for by the mother.
Sparrows cut into small pieces were a favourite food at this time.
Chopped mice were also provided and minced beef three times weekly.
All the young thrived and on September 23rd the first of them left
the nest.

REGISTER OF BIRDS BRED IN BRITAIN DURING 1974
</sectionHeader>

Compiled by Peter Brown
The breeding records for 1974 have been gathered and make a total
of 360 species. Thanks are recorded for all those who sent me their
breeding results and especially those who made the effort to send the
results of their acquaintances and friends.
The success of this depends naturally on the support of bird breeders,
and the more complete are the breeding results, the more useful is the
information in this register. We are particularly low on breeding of
British birds, for I know that a good many species are successfully bred
each year. Perhaps next year those who were successful with British
birds will be more forthcoming.
Whilst there are one or two known successful breeders who have not
submitted results, the majority of those who took part last year have
done so, plus several more, giving us a good many more species in the
list than last year.
To highlight some of the more interesting results, it is particularly
good to see three forms of flamingo being bred. Twelve Trumpeter
Swans by the Wildfowl Trust is an excellent result. Red-breasted Geese
seem to have had a good year with several people breeding more than
ten, and geese generally have done well, the breeding of 59 Hawaiian
Geese at Slimbridge being particularly outstanding.
With ducks, the list is long and full. It was nice to see that we have
breeding records of ten Radj ah Shelduck, several Baikal Teal, Golden-
eye, Bufflehead, Merganser and Smew. Perhaps the pick of the water-
fowl this year is the breeding of a Maccoa Duck by the Wildfowl Trust.
Diurnal birds of prey with the exception of Kestrels are all worthy
of note. Ferruginous Rough-legged Buzzard, Merlin and Lanner are
all outstanding breedings by the Falconry Centre as is the breeding of
twelve Cabot's Tragopans and twenty-nine Koklas Pheasants by the
Pheasant Trust. It is a pity that this latter bird which is bred regularly
at the Trust does not seem to be successfully propagated elsewhere.
The breeding of an Imperial Pheasant by London Zoo is notable for
surely this must be the only pair in Britain. It was nice to see that the
White Eared Pheasant has now been bred somewhere other than
Jersey.
Of the several cranes, the Stanley breeding is particularly note-
worthy and it is good to see that Chester Zoo are still regularly breed-
ing the Weka Rail. In the pigeons, perhaps most outstanding are the
Nicobar Pigeon and of course the Victoria Crowned Pigeons bred at
Bristol Zoo.
The list of parrot-like birds is almost as long as the waterfowl,
indicating their great success as subjects for aviculture. A good many

lories and lorikeets were bred with the Dusky Lory of Birdland and
the Iris Lorikeet by R. Kyme being particularly outstanding. I have
not heard of Deplanche's Lorikeet having been bred before. Cockatoos
did not do particularly well for we only have records of four species
being successfully bred. To my mind one of the great successes was the
rearing of five Scarlet and six Blue and Yellow Macaws by Rode.
Another interesting breeding in this family is the rare Cloncurry
Parrakeet bred by the late Lady Baillie and by P. Paris who also bred
the Timor Crimson-wing.
Jersey Zoo's breeding of the Pink-crested Touraco is very notable
and once again, as last year, many species of owl were bred; strangely
enough, the only one missing from last year's list is the Tawny Owl. Of
those bred perhaps the most unusual are the three Collared Scops Owls
bred by H. Smith.
We now come on to the majority of the so-called "softbills". It is
difficult to single any out for special mention for I consider all softbills
are difficult and any bred are a credit to the breeder. The Jackson's
Hornbill bred by London Zoo could well be a first breeding. Derrick
England has been particularly successful with his barbets this year, a
splendid example of the rewards of specialisation.
Birdworld's breeding of three Shamas is worthy of note; likewise
the four Indian Robins by R. E. Owen and the motmots by both
Birdland and Winged World.
Whilst we have very few records for British "hardbills", the foreign,
particularly Australian grassfinches and waxbills from Africa are well
represented. Several canaries and siskins bred by P. Paris are of par-
ticular note. Chester Zoo are to be congratulated on having bred two
species of whydah, both difficult to breed, being brood parasitic.
A good many species of starling were successfully reared, it is nice
to see that Amethyst Starlings, always a difficult species were reared by
two people. Spreo Starlings have done well as has the Rothchild's
Mynah and another of the year's highlights as far as I am concerned
is the breeding of no less than eighteen of this endangered species by
Jersey Zoo.
This is, then, a very brief summary of the breeding results I have
received for 1974, as yet far from complete, but more full than last
year.
If we can keep this annual register going and build on it year by
year with breeders being proud to send me their results rather than
being badgered for them, I hope in some small way it will encourage
aviculturists to redouble their efforts to at least attempt to breed from
every pair of birds in their possession; surely this is their duty.
I am anxiously seeking co-workers to help me accumulate as many
breeding records for 1975 onwards. If anyone would like to help, I
would be most grateful.

Among the successes in rare pheasant propagation reported in The
Pheasant Trust's Newsletter are the first captive breeding of Bulwer's
Pheasant by Dr. J. E. Lopez of Mexico City, a number of Bornean
Argus and White Eared Pheasants in United States collections and
twelve Cabot's Tragopans at Great Witchingham, while in the past
nine years Dr. K. C. Searle has bred a hundred Palawan Peacock
Pheasants in the Botanic Gardens, Hong Kong.

Mr. K. W. Dolton who succeeded in breeding the Thick-billed
Parrot in 1973 writes to say that the parents hatched another chick
during 1974, but it survived only four weeks due, he thinks, to the
presence in the same aviary of the 1973 bird which may have caused
the parents to neglect the young one. He bred during 1974 a Levail-
lant's, Double Yellow-fronted or Double-fronted Parrot as Amazona
ochrocephala oratrix is variously called. The mother is one of the two
young bred by Mr. Clifford Smith in 1970 and the pair nested in
1973, but failed to rear the one chick that hatched.

Mr. M. R. Lubbock, Curator at The Wildfowl Trust, Slimbridge,
writes :
The 1974 breeding season at Slimbridge proved to be one of the
most successful in the history of the Wildfowl Trust, especially in the
breeding of stiff tails and many of the fish-eating ducks; also the Buce-
phala (Goldeneyes).
As a result of the very mild winter, many of the geese nested earlier
than usual and they were caught out by the variable weather until
spring finally settled in.
On the whole, a rather dismal number of geese were raised. Although
a record number of 60 NeNes were reared, this number should have
been nearer 100. Infertility, addling and dead in shell took a heavy
toll of the eggs.
The usual large numbers of common species of duck were raised.
New ideas on feeding, nests and nest-sitings led to greater success in
raising the more difficult species. These were :

The new propagation quarters and feeding techniques were a great
advantage for these difficult ducklings.
It was also a good year for the White-winged Wood Duck with
thirty young being reared. One pair produced a second clutch, this
being the first time this has happened at Slimbridge.
The Black Swans excelled themselves in 1974 and thirty cygnets
w-?re raised. Most of the adult pairs now live in a colony and this is
proving to be very successful.
The pair of Bewick's raised three young, the female of the pair now
being 26 years old. The pair of Whoopers produced seven cygnets and
the Trumpeter Swans also produced well. The Trumpeter cygnets
were all females as seems to be the tendency with this species.
Only the Chilean and Greater Flamingos produced young, the
Chilean having up to 26 chicks at the height of the season. The last
few young to be produced late in the season never seem to grow well
like the earlier hatched birds, and they are usually lost. It is the
shortening of the daylength which causes a decrease in the amount
of time when vitamin D 2 can be built up which seems to be the factor
affecting these late-hatched birds. Only two Greater Flamingos were

1974. PP- 176. 100 colour photographs. #2.25.
The main purpose of this book is the series of colour photographs it
contains. There are a hundred of these pictures of birds, mostly single
close-ups, sometimes of pairs, in semi-natural settings. They are excel-
lent portraits of various species with all the details sharp and accurate.
They range through most of the typical types of foreign birds kept by
aviculturists, with emphasis on seed-eaters and other smaller birds
but including some parrots, quails and pigeons. Each picture is accom-
panied by a text on the species' management, breeding and feeding
under aviary conditions. The text appears to be sound, although I
would be less happy than the author on the subject of acclimatisation
of species in open aviaries, even without taking into account the range
of climatic difference that the reader may take for granted.
There are two obvious textual errors, an Indian Silverbill being des- !
cribed as the African form, and Assam appearing instead of Ceram
in the distribution of the Purple-capped Lory. The very excellence

of the photographs invites a few criticisms. Disarranged feathers be-
come very obvious; one wonders whether the obviously moulting
Golden-breasted Waxbill and Red Avadavat should have been in-
cluded without comment, and where colour is accurate the carotene
deficiency in the plumage of the Pekin Robin and the Coppersmith
Barbet become apparent.
In general however the book provides a well-illustrated introduction
to the keeping of foreign birds.

The British Aviculturists' Club
A meeting was held at the Rembrandt Hotel, Thurloe Place, London, on 13th
February, 1946, at which it was decided to form the B.A.G. This club was to be
confined to members of the Avicultural Society and was to be of a semi-social
nature. Thirty-two members and guests attended, thirty of whom subsequently
became members of the club. Unfortunately only nine of the Founder members
remain with us:--Miss P. Barclay-Smith, Derrick England, G. T. lies (Canada),
H. J. Indge, Terry Jones, P. H. Maxwell, A. A. Prestwich, Donald Risdon and
Sir Peter Scott.
During the first twenty-five years of its existence, nearly everyone interested
in birds attended the numerous dinners and meetings:--Field Marshal Viscount
Alanbrooke, Sir Norman Kinnear, Sir A. Landsborough Thomson, Sir Philip
Manson-Bahr, Raol Shri Dharmakumarsinhji of Bhavnagar, Lee S. Crandall,
Professor J. Berlioz, Captain Charles Knight (and "Mr. Ramshaw") to mention
just a few.
The present regime apparently considers that the club's interests conflict with
those of the Society and it is therefore in the process of being wound up.

Introduced Lovebirds in Mombasa

<bodyText confidence="0.997399789473684" page_id="56381304"  page_num="55" year="" vol="">
In February/March, 1974, I was fortunate to be able to pay a return visit
to the Game Reserves of East Africa, when during this sojourn I identified 186
different species of bird ranging from the Cordon Bleu Estrilda hengala to the
Bateleur Eagle Terathopius ecaudatus. Each Reserve we visited abounded
with birds of many species and it was really wonderful to see, in their natural
surroundings, the many exotic birds I knew and had read so avidly about;
truly a wonderful sight for the bird lover.
At the end of our tour of the Game Parks we spent a resting week at Nyali
Beach, Mombasa, where I was able to spend many hours watching, with the
aid of powerful binoculars, literally hundreds of Fischer's Lovebirds Agapornis
fischeri which were constantly in the palm trees in the grounds of the Nyali
Beach Hotel--also rows of them sat on the roof of the hotel before flying off
in a shrieking flock to forage on the beach. The majority were Fischer's which
continually passed overhead in flocks of 30 to 40 echoing their well-known call
notes as they flew. In their midst were the odd half-dozen or so Masked Love-
birds Agapornis per sonata--known locally as the Yellow-collared Lovebird,
which I personally think a more apt name for this attractive lovebird. When
they settled in the palms I was able to observe them at reasonably close quarters
and realised that a considerable number of them were hybrid Fischer's x Masked,

easily discernible by their smutty coloured heads. Having bred this hybrid
in my aviaries in the past, I am well aware of their appearance and was
therefore in no doubt whatsoever of their parentage.
Although I tried very hard to find their nesting sites by scouring the trees
for likely nesting holes; also the roof tops of various buildings where they seem
to spend a lot of their time under the eaves and around drainpipes, etc., I was
unable to observe any nesting activity. Perhaps my visit did not coincide with
their breeding season?
In the hotel grounds the Flame Trees were abounding with Golden Weavers
Ploceus subaureus whose nests festooned the upper branches, and what a noise
these attractive and industrious birds created all day long. Each evening as
twilight fell the lovebirds were heard calling overhead; they rapidly descended
into the Flame Trees and appeared to take possession of the vacant (?) weavers'
nests. From the balcony of my bedroom I would see this happen every evening
from fairly close quarters, and have no doubt at all that the lovebirds spent
the night in the empty weavers nests. Knowing the lovebirds' destructive habits
it seemed to me most remarkable that they did not pull the nests to bits, but
to the best of my knowledge no damage was done and the weavers did not seem
to mind the intrusion.

Lack of Protein as a Possible Cause of Feather Plucking in Cockatoos
Some time ago I purchased a wild hen "Great White" Cockatoo which had
been kept in cramped conditions for some months during which time she had
removed all her breast feathers and most of those in her wings and tail. The
head feathers including those in the crest were still covered in sheaths for
most of their length, as the bird had been unable to remove them. Shortly
after arrival the cockatoo was allowed to climb at freedom in the garden
where she soon attracted the attention of a male of the same species which
had been in residence for some time. With much display and formality the
male sidled up to the hen and began to preen the sheaths from her head
feathers while she responded by squatting on the branch and quivering her
wings. After about twenty minutes the male mounted the hen and mated with
her; then followed a long period of mutual preening which did much to
improve the hen's remaining feathers.
Housed in a large cage with plenty of freedom in the garden during the
day the cockatoo soon began to grow new feathers but she removed these as
soon as they were well advanced in the blood-quill stage and ate them. Not
content with this she started to remove growing feathers from her mate, so I
stepped up the meat intake for the pair, providing minced raw beef and
chicken bones together with egg and cheese. All these items were eaten avidly
but just how much the cockatoo craved meat was brought home to me in a
rather strange way.
Discovering that mice had taken up residence in the bird room I set traps
at random and in taking down one these complete with dead mouse from a
high shelf I noticed that the hen cockatoo was showing great excitement, ap-
proaching the wire front of her cage and fixing her gaze on the dead mouse.
I wondered what her reaction would be if confronted by the mouse at close
quarters, so when the cockatoo was in the garden I placed the mouse on a
nearby branch and withdrew to the house to watch. Within seconds the bird
had grabbed the mouse and had removed and eaten the head, holding the
animal in one foot. At this stage the male cockatoo approached and tried to
grab the mouse but the hen was not having this and removed herself and her
meal to another branch and proceeded to skin the body and eat the contents
until only the skin and tail remained.
I have since offered the birds three other mice which have been skinned in
the same manner and eaten with obvious relish. The general condition of the

hen seems to be much improved and new feathers are appearing in her wings
and tail, so maybe she no longer has the urge to destroy her plumage for the
sake of the blood she needed.
One reads of cockatoos, kept caged in pairs, who never feather properly
and I wonder if lack of sufficient meat in the diet could be the cause of this
lack of condition, the birds removing each other's feathers in an effort to
balance their dietary needs.
Returning to mice as a food item; it would of course be essential only to
provide mice that were free from any form of poison such as Warfarin.

The Trade in Rare Birds
The Magazine takes some time in reaching me and as a result this corres-
pondence is delayed. I would like to reply to Mr. Cooper's letter of the July-
August 1974 issue concerning my article "Birds of Paradise in Captivity; a
Major Moral Problem".
I received the July-August issue before the March-April and was surprised
by Mr. Cooper's comments as, from memory of what T had written (having no
copy with me) I felt much had been misinterpreted or misread. With my article
now before me, however, I think Mr. Cooper must have read it rather too
quickly. In addition I find some of his original statements rather startling.
My greatest regret is my current isolation from the numerous relevant works of
reference to which I might respectfully have referred him
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.993241529411765" page_id="56381356"  page_num="57" year="" vol="">
Mr Cooper shares my concern that "avicultural activities might be the
reason why some species are becoming very scarce and might even cause their
extinction;" however he is "of the opinion that avicultural activities have never
been the cause whereby any species of birds has become extinct and that
aviculture has not prevented the extinction of a species." The use of the
word might is Mr. Cooper's innovation. Of birds of paradise I wrote "This
situation must have a serious detrimental effect upon the populations", and
"the situation must be made worse by exportation of live birds".
Does Mr. Cooper really consider that aviculture has never actually caused
the extinction of a species a saving grace? I feel I made it clear that (in cases
of rare birds) things are made worse by the live bird trade. I did not state
that aviculture has been, or will be, the sole cause of extinction. This possibility
is almost inconceivable. I feel sure, however, there is no need to point out
that, at least, some parrot populations have, and do, suffer from the live bird
trade. Some of these birds are close to extinction, though of course not solely
for this ieason. Writing of the St. Lucia parrot Amazona versicolor , Fisher,
Simon and Vincent (Red Data Book, London 1969) wrote "It is probably
under shooting pressure by pigeon hunters; and by live bird hunters, for a
high price is paid for any Lesser Antillean parrot in good condition. Many
are shot in the hope of their being "wing-tipped". Of the genus Amazona the
above authors wrote "Every one of the living Amazona parrots here mentioned
(being all the rarest species only) has been kept in captivity, and even the two
extinct ones most probably have". Some (fortunately very few I think) people still
hanker after these extremely rare parrots and could not, or would not, resist
the dealer who "could have one in the country in a few weeks" for the right
price.
Mr. Cooper would underestimate aviculture in both directions if he believes
"that aviculture has not yet prevented the extinction of a species". I am sure
the Wildfowl Trust and similar institutions would disagree. I refer, of course,
to the history of the Hawaiian Goose or Nene Branta sandvicensis, perhaps the
best known avicultural success.
Mr. Cooper tells us that extra avicultural interest is always directed at a
species as soon as it becomes in short supply. He goes on to state this is always
associated with a number of causes which he lists whilst excluding, remarkably

enough, the fact that many are in short supply because they have to be smuggled
in small numbers.
If of Mr. Cooper's outlook I would certainly give up all hope of the kind
of control I would like to see come into practice; but I am not. Who, in this
more-than-ever conservation minded world, can state "control of trade and
illegal trafficking cannot have any effect", when evidence of very similar
situation is so overwhelming. Instances of "a Society in Britain influencing a
foreign power with regard to the use it makes of its own fauna" must be
very numerous. This I must, however, leave for some better qualified person
to comment upon, but I will refer to Mr. Yealland's comments upon the
influence of this kind in the hands of the I.C.B.P., an international body but
no doubt of modest origins.
My suggestion was that our Society should form a "rare and endangered
list" committee, in order to "express the deep concern most of its practitioners
have for rare and endangered avifaunas with recommendations of its own".
How can other Societies possibly object to another Society placing restric-
tions upon its own membership? The hope is that they might follow suit. As
for other Societies discussing the situation, the more it is 'aired' the better.
That the keeping of rare and endangered species be restricted to persons or
institutions with adequate conditions was what I in fact wrote. No discrimina-
tion between private keepers and establishments has been made by myself.
Birds of paradise are fully protected on their home grounds and are there-
fore illegally exported and the point stressed by myself is that the purchasing
of smuggled birds is the cause for concern. Odd that Mr. Cooper so readily
refers to the Washington Convention (aspects of which presumably originated
in the minds of modest Societies and the public at large) when he expresses
such a lack of faith in the international influence of concern for faunas.
If Mr. Cooper's hope is to put my mind at rest, may he be more optimistic
about the influence men can have upon each other to the benefit of themselves
and nature. As for myself I sincerely hope this has not put Mr. Cooper's mind
at rest, for I feel the day for such self deceit is far off, certainly in respect
of the birds of paradise. The question of seeking and obtaining rare species
is often not so much one of illegality as it is an ethical one.

The Late K. A. Norris j;
I feel that we should not allow the sad loss of our late member K. A. Norris
to pass with no more notice than was possible in the issue of the Magazine
following his death.
I am proud to have known Ken Norris for over forty years and remember
him as one of the outstanding aviculturists of his time. He was a great example
of that all-too-rare combination, a bird keeper who was also an experienced
and widely read field naturalist. Most helpful to those whom he felt to be
deserving, his knowledge of and interest in all forms of wildlife went far beyond
the cage and covered almost the whole world; and perhaps not everyone knew
that he was a first-class bird photographer of the old "glass plate, mahogany
and brass" school and that his ability to paint birds was of a high order.
It was not given to many to know him well and a delightful sense of humour
was often hidden behind a shy and even off-putting manner, since the making
of friends was not always encouraged in a somewhat repressive and restrict-
ing home life. He is greatly to be admired for his long devotion to elderly
parents, and it is sad indeed that the joy of his late marriage was to prove so
short lived.

Identification of Subspecies in Trichoglossus haematodus
Harrison (avicult. mag., 76, 1970, pp. 191-194) has given a thorough
discussion of why there is usually little value for aviculturists to pay attention
to the subspecific identity of birds, illustrating his arguments with examples
from the appropriately named Rainbow Lorikeet Trichoglossus haematodus.
It therefore comes as a surprise to be presented with a chart to assist the
identification of the subspecies of this species, prepared by Rosemary Low,
that arrived between the pages of avicult. mag. 80, No. 6, accompanying a
note by the same author on pp. 203-204.
Having examined most specimens of Trichoglossus in British museums-and
the extensive material at the American Museum of Natural History, I am
convinced that many of the subspecies listed on the chart can only be recog-
nised by comparison with adequate museum material, and that a proportion of
specimens can then only be placed in the correct subspecies by reference to
the locality where they were collected. With care the following four subspecies
can be reliably recognised from single adult birds of unknown origin, T. h.
rosenbergii, mitchellii, weberi and rubritorquis; the other eighteen subspecies
can be identified to subspecies groups as follows: T. h. haematodus group
(haematodus, berauensis, caeruleiceps, micropteryx, intermedius, flavicans,
nesophilus, massena and deplanchii), T. h. forsteni group ( forsteni, djam-
peanus, mitchellii and stresemanni), T. h. capistratus group ( capistratus, fortis
and flavotectus), T. h. moluccanus group ( moluccanus and septentrionalis),
(T. h. caeruleiceps and septentrionalis were omitted from Miss Low's list without
comment).

THE BLUE MUTATION OF THE SPLENDID

Neophema splendida
By J. R. Hodges (Pinner, Middlesex)
The last decade has seen the establishment of a number of psittacine
mutations. Two particularly attractive grass parrakeet mutations have
appeared--the yellow Turquoisine and the blue Splendid--and are
being bred successfully, although in limited numbers, in aviaries in
this and other European countries as well as in Australia, their country
of origin.
The existence of a blue variety of N. splendida was first brought to
my attention more than ten years ago by an article in the avicultural
magazine in which Mons. J. Delacour referred to the presence, in an
Adelaide aviary, of Splendid Grass Parrakeets with much of their green
plumage replaced by blue. Later, in Australian aviculture, I read
about Mr. D. Ikin's collection in Melbourne, which included a patiently
built up stock of what the writer referred to as " Blue Scarlets ". I
must have been fired with an intense enthusiasm to possess some speci-
mens of this mutation of one of my favourite species and, looking
back, I hate to dwell on how much time and effort I spent in an
attempt to persuade various Australian authorities to issue a permit
for their export. However, my time was not entirely wasted and, about
ten years ago, a few pairs arrived at London Airport. One pair went
to the London Zoo, where their arrival was recorded in the Maga-
zine, but the hen soon died from infestation with round worms.
John Yealland kindly let me have the cock on loan. It was mated to a
normal hen but the pair did not breed and the cock, apparently a
fairly old bird, died two years later. I had no better luck with my own
specimens. One pair nested several times, hatched clutches of five and
six chicks, but the youngsters invariably died within 24 hours of hatch-
ing. Eventually, two cocks and one hen of the original imported stock
were left with no offspring to show for three years of effort. The failure
of my birds to rear any chicks appeared to be explained when the

J. R. HODGES--BLUE SPLENDID GRASS PARRAKEET
Australian breeder told me that mating two blue birds together intro-
duced a lethal factor and the fully developed embryos either failed to
hatch or died immediately afterwards. I decided, therefore, to pair all
my remaining blue specimens to normals. As a result some excellent
split blue youngsters were reared which were subsequently paired to
unrelated blue parent birds. By 1973 I even reached the stage of having
a few surplus youngsters for disposal. One blue pair went to George
Smith and almost immediately disproved the " lethal gene " theory by
breeding successfully. In spite of this, I am continuing my own breed-
ing attempts using blue birds mated to unrelated split blues--a mating
which produces theoretically blue and split blue offspring in equal
numbers.
The mutation is due to probably more than one recessive factor
since it is possible to obtain, from the same parents, several blue young 1
birds no two of which are identical in colour. In general the green of 1
the normal is replaced by blue, the yellow by creamy-white and the
red of the cock by a pinkish-apricot. The blue can vary from almost
violet to a greenish-blue, the chest colour from a pale pink flush to
orange and the underparts from cream to white. In some cocks the
blue of the back and face is particularly intense and the underparts are
snow-white with hardly a trace of pink on the chest. Others are
greenish-blue on the back, orange on the chest with the abdomen and
under tail-coverts very pale yellow. The hens exhibit a similar variation
and some have blue chests, bluish-green backs and cream underparts
whereas others are deep blue on the chest and back and white on the
abdomen and under the tail. When the young leave the nest they are !
a lovely powder-blue rather like that of the blue Ring-necked Parrakeet.
Splendids have a feather texture which appears to be different from
that of the other species of their genus and the green feathers of the
back and wings have some degree of iridescence. This is particularly
noticeable in those mutants in which the blue pigmentation is less
intense and they appear blue in dull light and shining blue-green in
the sun. I have heard these described as " poor coloured blues " but,
with their orange chests, they are quite as attractive as the deeper i
coloured specimens. There is usually an inverse correlation between the
intensity of the blue and the depth of the pinkish-apricot on the chest
but, last year, a cock was reared from a pair consisting of a deep blue
cock and a split blue hen, which has a dark green back and yellow
underparts and an almost completely yellow chest.
" Experts ", who usually ultimately admit that they have never seen
one, have told me that the blue mutants are weakly specimens. Nothing
could be further from the truth. They are as large as most normal
Splendids and, more important, they are just as hardy. Mine are kept
in aviaries with unheated shelters and many of them persist in roosting
in the open flights in the most adverse weather conditions. However,

during the 15 years or so for which I have kept Splendid Parrakeets, I
have had many sudden deaths and therefore I would never describe
this species as being as robust as the other members of the genus
Neophema. Like Gouldian Finches, Splendids have the distressing habit
of looking perfectly fit in the evening and being dead the following
morning from causes which are difficult to determine.
It has not been possible to breed sufficient numbers to consider the
blue mutation to be firmly established. None of my pairs have been
prolific. Fertility has been excellent but the successful breeding pairs
have seldom reared more than two or three of the chicks which have
hatched. Furthermore, they have a tendency to moult in July with the
result that they are usually only single brooded. However, it appears
that some have reached the Continent from Australia and perhaps the
breeders in Holland, with their avicultural " green fingers ", will show
us how to establish firmly this truly exquisite mutation. A two-year-old
pair is the subject of the plate in this issue of the Magazine. Ron Digby,
one of our most talented young bird artists, has skilfully captured the
greenish iridescence, which the blue exhibits in certain lights, in this
accurate and lovely painting.

<bodyText confidence="0.989272545454546" page_id="56381368"  page_num="63" year="" vol="">
By Herbert Murray (Brentwood, Essex)
From an avicultural point of view, 1974 was one of the most unusual
that I have known, being well supplied with events both pleasant and
interesting and others that were not so good.
At the beginning of the year I had built up my stock of birds to a
fair size, containing many true pairs which I hoped to be able to
persuade to nest successfully.
The first bit of trouble occurred in February when a terrific gale
damaged part of the roof (which damage was obvious and soon repaired
and occasioned the loss of no birds) and the loosening of a piece of
netting on the roof which only opened a gap now and then and was
not spotted for some time. A few birds were lost here; I knew that
something was wrong, for I found some of my birds sitting hungrily
outside the main door of the aviary awaiting my arrival and when I
went in they came inside at once without trouble.
Early in April I had several visits from a thief who was very difficult
to pin down, but by the end of April all gaps were repaired, my
unwelcome visitor was in Borstal and it was possible to settle down;
however many of my pairs had now become odd birds.
I have never known a season when so many birds decided to attempt
to breed. Some of these were not successful, but were very interesting
all the same.

Crested Lark Galerida cristata
I had several of these birds and could not sex them, but in one aviary
I apparently had one cock and two hens.
Both hens nested and laid, but I must say that the building of the
nest was very different from what I had expected. No natural hollow in
the ground was chosen, but a definite hole about the size of a large
teacup was dug out by the bird. I saw this done, and the soil was
carried out of the hole in the bird's beak : the sides of the hole were
smoothed and the nest was built inside, mainly of dry grass and rootlets.
Clutches ranged in size from two to four eggs and a number of nests
were built, but only one brood of four reared.
One nest was built above ground in a corner, and here the young
were reared until fledged : they then disappeared. The young birds
were the greatest experts in " freezing " that I have come across. They
were fed on insects, but I suspect a fairly wide selection of foods was
given.
Larks are curious feeders and if given access to a wide variety of
foods, as my birds are, they seem to eat a bit of everything. They cer-
tainly eat a lot of seed. I was very pleased to rear these birds, as it was
the first breeding for many years.

These birds have always interested me, as they differ so widely from
the general run of birds that one keeps.
Here again, in the same aviary I had one cock and two hens. I knew
that one of the hens was nesting and I knew roughly where the nest
was. Other birds were breeding nearby and I did not wish to disturb
these, so I did not probe too deeply into the secrets of the finch larks.
Three young were reared, but one subsequently died. Both of the
remaining birds, hens, have overwintered well and cannot be seen to
differ from the old birds.
Finch larks are queer little birds, with a weak fluttering flight they
seldom use. They prefer a mixture of sand and compost on the floor of
their aviary and have a habit of burrowing in the earth until their
backs are level with the surface. I suspect they sleep in this fashion,
but I have not been able to prove this. I have never seen them bathe in
v/ater, but they spend a lot of time sand-bathing. Only once have I
seen a bird drink water, but I think it likely that they drink at dawn
in the same fashion as sandgrouse. After all they come from the same
type of country as the sandgrouse.
Here again they eat a wide variety of food, but mealworms are the
greatest treat that one can give them. They will use a large door near
the ground to go into the aviary shelter, but I always bring them in for
the winter. They are so highly specialised for their habitat that they
do not seem to possess the usual adaptability of small birds. There is
little song that I have heard, indeed the birds are mainly mute. The

main display seems to be the raising of the crown feathers of the cock,
but this is not very spectacular. One gets the feeling that there is an
awful lot one does not know about these strange, drab little birds.
Spanish Sparrow Passer hispaniolensis
I bred this bird in 1973, but found it much more freely nesting in
1974. Indeed, it would be quite true to say that at the moment I have
a surfeit of these birds.
In an aviary they take a long time to settle down, and even when
left in the aviary in which they were born they take fright very quickly;
however a few generations of aviary breeding should cure that.
According to the books the Spanish Sparrow builds away from
towns : my birds nest in holes and crannies and build a typical spar-
row's nest, and they have all the bustling rowdiness of our House
Sparrow, an efficient exploiter of the human race.
They seem to eat almost anything that is provided, but when rearing
young take any live food they can get and failing this they will feed
the young with substitutes. In this way they are identical with the
African Golden Sparrow.
My Spanish Sparrows had four nests and reared about a dozen
youngsters. The first three nests were in holes, but the fourth, built
while the weather was hot, was in a bush. In this respect also these
birds behave in the same way as House Sparrows.
Little Masked Weaver Ploceus luteolus
This is a well known and pretty little weaver, and one that is quiet
and well behaved with the other birds in the aviary. Its nest differs in
some ways from the general run of weavers' nests: it is built of
strands pulled from plants, not blades of grass. In my case palm is
used; the whole nest is very closely woven and is of great tensile
strength. The entrances point downward and the " spouts " are
strongly made, with any part likely to loosen being strongly reinforced.
Some nests built by the same bird have two entrances and some only
one. The nest in which the eggs are laid usually has one entrance. All
sitting is done by the hen, but as far as I could see, the cock built the
nest.
As the nest is small to start with and the entrance is at the bottom,
both eggs and young have a habit of falling out, and rearing is not
very common. Two eggs seem to compose the clutch, but out of four
nests, only two broods were successfully reared, four young birds in all.
The young birds when they fly are grey, but after a month or so
turn into the yellowish-green shade similar to the hen.
It is rather interesting to note that any young birds that fall out of
the nest are fit and alive, and it is rather hard to discover the reason
why they fall. It may well be that in an aviary some other bird throws
them out, but I have no evidence of this. The young are fed on live
food, and also possibly by regurgitation but I cannot confirm this. Soft

food is also fed, but this is always carried in the beak.
It is the great strength of the nest that interests me with this weaver,
and the finely made and smooth nature of the " fabric As I said
before, I know that strands of palm leaf are used, but I suspect that
the fibrous inner bark of branches used as perches may also be pressed
into service.
Grey-headed Social Weaver Pseudonigrita arnaudi
Everybody who has looked at books covering birds from Africa has
seen illustrations of the nests of these birds and of the Social Weaver
Philetarius socius which builds the huge communal nests.
Where my birds are concerned, I regret to say that there is a great
deal of difference between the illustrations and the performance.
I have a pair of these birds, and they followed the Spanish Sparrows
round and took over the sparrows' nests as the sparrows finished with
them.
They built a similar nest to the sparrows, and there was no sign of
them weaving at all. Unfortunately, although they appeared to hatch
young, they did not rear any.
At one time I had several pairs of these birds together and although
they never stopped nesting, never once, as far as I could see, did they
make an attempt to weave.

A pair of these attractive little birds nested all summer, but never
finally managed to rear anything. The nearest they got to success was
a fully fledged youngster. In essence these birds are born losers. Most
of their nests were taken by other birds and they would have been far
better if they could have had an aviary on their own.
St. Helena Waxbill Estrilda astrild
This was the third season with my little colony of these birds, and
although they nested freely, they did not seem to rear as many young
as they should have done. Although they are kept in a planted aviary
some 54 ft. x 17 ft. which should have been large enough to suit most
social breeding birds, there must have been a considerable number of
nests which were not successful. It appears that there is a limit to the
concentration of even these sociable birds.
Orange-cheeked Waxbills and the Common Firefinch were also
bred, while tanagers of various kinds provided a lot of additional
interest.
Yellow-backed Tanager Ramphocelus icteronotus
I have a fine pair of these birds and they nested throughout the
summer. The first nest was in March, and one young bird was reared
and flew. They had several other nests but the final tally was not
impressive.
In the same aviary I had an odd hen tanager, probably one of the
black tanagers Ramphocelus flammigerus and this bird built a nest on

the ground and laid two eggs. She must have mated with the Yellow-
backed; one egg hatched and the young bird was reared. At the
moment it is not possible to see much of what it will be like, but the
youngster is very fit and after its second moult should show signs of
adult plumage.
I also had a cock Blue-headed Tanager Tangara cyanicollis and this
bird paired with a hen Opal-rumped Tanager Tangara velia. The hen
laid two eggs which hatched and were reared. The young were hand-
some and very active birds; one was stolen, but I hope to pair the
remaining bird back to its father and see what happens.
There were a considerable number of attempted breedings which did
not reach full success, but may be of interest to record.
In tanagers Euphonia mesochrysa nested and laid two eggs. One
hatched, but was not reared. These birds built a strong closed nest and,
unlike all other tanagers that I know, sat very closely.
Mrs. Wilson's Tanager Tangara nigrocincta nested all summer but
reared no young at all. This was due more to their highly specialised
nest building than anything else. The nests consisted of a very small
quantity of green grass blades placed in the crotch of a branch or small
hollow. As the grass dried, it shrunk, the nest virtually disappeared and
the eggs usually fell out. What the bird uses in the wild is difficult to
imagine.
Schrank's Tanager Tangara schranki paired to a cock Emerald
Spotted Tanager Tangara guttata partially reared a youngster, and a
hen Palm Tanager Thraupis palmarum and a hen White-winged
Thraupis episcopus made a nest together; both laid in it and spent the
summer sitting happily side by side.
I must confess that two of my biggest disappointments were with
buntings.
Yellow-browed Bunting Emberiza chrysophrys
I have a pair of these very handsome birds and they nested all
summer, but although they hatched they never reared anything. They
built a solid nest and sat very closely, never leaving the eggs unattended
for a moment. They did hatch a youngster, but it was not reared.
Versicolor Bunting Passerina versicolor
These birds also laid and hatched young, but did not rear any..
Greatest disappointment of all--two pairs of Cedar Waxwings laid
and sat, but again nothing to show for it. Taking it all in all it was an
interesting summer.
One point struck me very forcibly and this concerns the actual style
of incubation.
As will be seen from the foregoing notes, I had birds nest whose
natural ranges run from the tropics to Siberia and Canada. There was
a great difference in the incubating patterns between birds from the
two extremes, and although the obvious reason for the birds from cold

regions was climatic, I am not too sure that this is the only reason. I
suppose one could say that England, last summer, was about an average
between the higher northern latitudes and the tropics.
Tanagers, which of course mostly come from the tropics, are very
casual when it comes to sitting on their eggs and will often leave them
for an hour or more when they feel inclined. Most tanagers come from
regions of fast and heavy plant growth, and their nests therefore
become completely hidden in a very short time. In spite of the time
the tanagers left their nests unattended, not one fertile egg failed to
hatch.
On the other hand, birds from the colder regions, in spite of con-
stant incubation, hatched a very much smaller proportion of young.
It has occurred to me that much of the brooding done by birds is
not actually necessary to the hatching of the young, but is brought
about by the necessity of concealment and protection of the eggs from
predators. To put it simply, where a bird has adequate protection for
its nest by rapid growth of vegetation, etc. it sits for a relatively short
time, and the cock bird seldom helps, but in the case of birds nesting
in areas where the vegetation is much sparser and the nest is therefore
much easier for a predator to see, the nest is never left and both the
parent birds help with incubation. I realise that in the colder regions
the temperature varies rapidly and widely, but summer 1974 in Eng-
land was very different from the tropics; the tanagers who sat very
casually had a very high hatching rate in spite of the fact that their
eggs were subject to violent fluctuations of temperature.

BREEDING THE RUFOUS-CHINNED LAUGHING THRUSH
AT WINGED WORLD

<bodyText confidence="0.997316785714286" page_id="56381373"  page_num="68" year="" vol="">
By Bryan S. Ward (Heysham, Morecambe, Lancs.)
The Rufous-chinned Laughing Thrush Garrulax rufogularis is one
of the smaller laughing thrushes, being nine inches in length. It is found
in the Himalayas from Nepal to northern Burma, where it skulks in
the dense shrubby undergrowth. Its general colouring above is rich
olive brown and grey, squamated with black. The crown, nape and
ear-coverts are black; a large ring around the eyes grey. The lores are
white and the chin rufous; the underparts are whitish spotted with
black and the tail-coverts are a rich chestnut, the tail feathers rufescent J
with a subterminal black band and the sexes are alike.
The pair that we have in Winged World were purchased in April
1968 and were released into one of our glass-fronted compartments.
They showed no interest in breeding until June 1973, when they laid
two eggs in an open wicker basket of the type often used by finches.

again and these too disappeared. The culprits I believe were a pair of
Green Wood Hoopoes Phoeniculus purpureus.
The laughing thrushes were then put into our " Free Flight" where
there was more cover for nesting activities; they were seen carrying
nesting material about but nothing came of it. They subsequently
ended up in our " Open Exhibit " which contains mainly waders. A
nest basket of the type they had used previously was fixed in a tree Ficus
lyrata in which they showed immediate interest and they were again
frequently seen carrying nesting material about.
In the spring of 1974 the hen was sitting again, but on this occasion
also she was unsuccessful as the eggs were thrown out, this time by a
pair of Bristle-crowned Starlings Onychognathus salvadorii. These
were housed in the " Free Flight ", but regularly commuted from there
across the public concourse into the " Open Exhibit " as and when they
felt so inclined. We could not remove them owing to the fact that they
had young in the "Free Flight" at that time and so we decided to
leave things as they were.
The Rufous-chinned Laughing Thrushes continued to lay clutches
of eggs at frequent intervals in this nest over the next few months, but
always to no avail, although on one occasion she did manage to hatch
two youngsters, these too being thrown out at an early age. When the
laughing thrushes were ultimately successful in rearing their youngster
we were unable to determine the incubation period, for a close check
on them had not been kept, as on the many previous occasions things
had turned out so disastrously. We are not even sure of the date that the
chick hatched; it left the nest on the 20th July, a much smaller and
duller edition of the parents, and we assume that it hatched 12 days
earlier as both the cock and hen were seen searching for food at that
time. It was reared almost exclusively on the mealworms offered, as
far as we could ascertain.
We were surprised to find that when looking up at it from the
ground, the youngster could be seen moving about through the bottom
of the nest. On checking, after the chick had left, we found that no
attempt whatsoever had been made to build, the wicker basket being
completely devoid of nesting material. Dr. Harrison (a.m., vol. 68, pp.
188-196) has drawn attention to the problem of supplying nesting
material acceptable to this species.
As described the Rufous-chinned Laughing Thrush Garrulax rufogularis has
been bred at Winged World, Heysham, and this is believed to be the first breed-
ing in this country. Anyone knowing of a previous breeding of this species is
asked to inform the Secretary or Editor.

<bodyText confidence="0.990490441860465" page_id="56381375"  page_num="70" year="" vol="">
By Wolfgang Scherzinger (Waldhauser, Germany)
My breeding experiments were started originally for the purpose of
scientific observation where this could not be made in the wild, and
for this reason I used mostly hand-reared, tame parent birds. Later the
importance of rearing offspring of rare species for re-introduction to
the wild became a further motive.
It is advisable in breeding to avoid mixing species in an aviary or to
have more than one pair of owls in the aviary which should be as large
as possible and afford good places of concealment. Only reasonably
tame birds breed successfully in small aviaries in my experience.
As owls, naturally, only breed when they are in good condition, a
suitable diet is of the greatest importance. Many species are specialised
on certain kinds of prey, so that the principle of a varied diet does not
apply to owls. Mice, rats, guinea-pigs, sometimes day-old chicks, are
most suitable--raw meat only in exceptional cases. Some species also
eat fish, insects and other invertebrates, and I have known of captive
owls eating vegetable food such as salad. It is not advisable to give
sparrows, chicken heads, crows, etc. in view of salmonellosis and the
danger of a Herpes virus infection. In any case deep-frozen food is
inferior to freshly-killed prey, a fact that is reflected in the hatching
results. Should the food freeze in the aviary, it is not harmful to the
birds, but care must be taken that the small species do not just starve.
Doses of vitamins during the display period have proved very bene-
ficial to Pygmy Owl, Tengmalm's Owl and Ural Owl.
To secure the most complete synchronisation of the partners the
birds should be kept out of doors the whole year; this ensures their
requirements of rain, sun- and sand-bathing. Birds hardened to all
weathers must also be given shelter from wind and rain. As most owls
are sensitive to disturbance it is advisable to have a protective (screen)
facing to at least one of the aviary walls, for some species to the roof
as well.
In many cases the nature of the nesting place is the decisive factor
for breeding success. Natural holes are often plainly preferred to nest-
boxes and it is recommended to offer the owls a large selection of nests
of various sizes and types. It is best to bring the breeding pairs together
as early as the autumn so that they can be studied intensively during
the winter months and, if necessary, one of the partners be changed
before the breeding season begins. In some species sex determination is
especially difficult as this is only possible through the vocal utterances,
which in the case of a pair of young birds, is not always rightly deter-
mined by the owls themselves ! Individuals that have been hand-reared
are mostly imprinted to humans and are often not suitable for breeding
purposes.

I have kept several owls (Little and Scops Owl) since 1964; my first
breeding success was in 1968 with Pygmy Owl. Since then I have been
able to breed nine species successfully--in great part thanks to the kind
support of my friend, Dr. H. Frey. In the following the species art
listed in the order of their size: the cage/aviary dimensions (length
and breadth) are given and the height ranged from 1.5 to 3.5 m.
Pygmy Owl Glaucidium passerinum : Kept in aviaries of 16x6 m.,
4x3m. and 2 x 2 m in size. This small owl requires the relatively
largest aviary, as it flies very swiftly and, in restricted aviaries, the
smaller male can be pursued and killed in a quarrel with the female.
It reaches sexual maturity in the first year; the natural holes of Great
Spotted Woodpecker and Three-toed Woodpecker are the preferred
nesting sites and it also deposits prey there. Day-old chicks as sole
nourishment is not sufficient for successful breeding. Only one brood
per year; up to now a maximum of nine young per brood. The parent
birds were hand-reared and have produced 62 young since 1968.
Sgops Owl Otus scops : The aviary should afford as much shelter
as possible. It is even possible to breed this species indoors. The pair
should be brought together by March/April at the latest. Although
some individuals breed under unfavourable conditions, others cannot
be stimulated to do so under the most perfect conditions. The owls
accept the most varied types of nest-box. The parent birds were pur-
chased and two young were hatched in 1973.
Tengmalm's Owl Aegolius funereus : Aviaries of 6 x 3 m., 2x3 m.
and 2 x 2 m. in size. This species seeks cover and should not be dis-
turbed while incubating. Day-old chicks as sole diet is not sufficient;
in addition to fresh mice, vitamins should be given, otherwise a high
embryo mortality can result. This owl favours deep, roomy holes for
breeding, preferably those of Black Woodpecker. As the male, before
the breeding season starts, frequently pursues the female, it is some-
times necessary to separate the pair but to keep them in visual contact.
The parent birds were hand-reared : one to two broods a year, with a
maximum of six young. Sixteen young birds reared since 1969; mostly
poor hatching results.
Little Owl Athene noctua : It is possible to breed in small aviaries,
but these must always offer plenty of shelter, as even hand-reared birds
are very wild. Size 12x5 m., 1 x 3 m.; roof and sides covered. The
owls reach sexual maturity in the first year and favour deep holes and
burrows (horizontal or vertical). Good breeding results can be achieved
even if day-old chicks are the sole diet. One brood per year; a maxi-
mum of six young per brood. The parent birds were hand-reared and
produced 20 young since 1970.
Barn Owl Tyto alba : A sheltered, well-protected enclosure is the
most favourable. If left undisturbed and given abundant nourishment

the owls nest in very small aviaries, even in a room. They are sexually
mature in the first year and have two to three overlapping broods a :
year. An exclusive diet of deep-frozen food or day-old chicks reduces
the hatching results by 70 percent. The parent birds were purchased;
broods with a maximum of six resulted in 19 young since 1972.
Tawny Owl Strix aluco : A hand-reared pair was kept in an out-
door aviary from 1968. As I did not take any great trouble with them,
the owls did not nest until 1973, in a room (1.5 x 4 m. in size) and
reared only one young bird. The nest-box was a wooden case with a
roof (30 x 40 cm.).
Ural Owl Strix uralensis : Large aviaries are essential as the female
often pursues her partner. During incubation the birds are also ex-
tremely aggressive towards the keeper and for this reason they should
be fed from outside and all cleaning activities in the aviary should be
postponed. The aviary must be absolutely free of disturbance so that
the female does not leave the clutch too often. High-grade food, with
added vitamins, in the period before the eggs are laid is to be recom-
mended. The owls are sexually mature in the first year and accept
wooden cases, baskets or hollow trunks as nesting places. The parent j
birds were purchased; they have brooded since 1970 without success,
for which reason the two young in 1973 were reared by hand. In 1974
these two reared one young bird themselves and their parents three
young = six altogether up to the present time.
Snowy Owl Nyctea scandiaca : Here the size of the aviary is of less j
importance than that it should command a good open view. The owls
accept all food; they breed in their first year but do not usually effic-
iently care for the young until the second year. Male and female scratch
a nest hollow in the ground, preferably on a little mound with a gravel
foundation, if from here the sitting female has a good view over the
territory in front of the aviary. Snowy Owls should not be kept in
closed, or even worse, in heated rooms. The parent birds were pur-
chased; the broods in 1969 and 1972 were unsuccessful; eight young
from 1970 to 1974.
Eagle Owl Bubo bubo : As not all pairs are compatible, it is import-
ant to keep them under careful observation to ensure a good breeding
pair. It is of advantage to keep them in large aviaries so that parent
birds and young have room to retreat when the cage is cleaned. It is
advisable to board up at least two sides of the aviary. In order to
avoid disturbance in the aviary and injury to the keeper from attacks
by the female, it is advisable to feed from outside and to forego all
cleaning activities during the breeding period. The female chooses as
a breeding site a raised corner of the aviary from which she can survey
her surroundings, or a roomy recess with an uninterrupted view. Shel-
ter from the weather should be provided as the owl may breed in
February. Although Eagle Owls will accept all food offered, it is not

There are two remarkably successful bird breeders in the vicinity of
the city of Phoenix and I have made a habit in recent years of visiting
their aviaries every winter when I am in the western United States.
Central Arizona possesses a very favourable climate for tender species--
the winter is mild, the temperature very seldom dropping below freez-
ing and it is hot during the summer months. It seldom rains, but
extensive areas are irrigated and highly productive, for there is an
abundance of underground water.
Aviaries have to be well shaded, but otherwise little shelter from the
weather is required. Mr. B. Roer has a long record of successes with
a variety of birds--waterfowl, cranes, game birds, pigeons and doves,
parrots and parrakeets and a number of passerines. He has reared in
recent years, among many other species, Crowned, Demoiselle and
Stanley Cranes and also various curassows such as the Great, the
Wattled and the Blue-billed; he had partial success with the Nocturnal,
a rare species which so far has only been completely reared at the
Houston (Texas) Zoo. He raises each year Green Peafowl and he has
selectively bred a white variety, the size and shape of the original
Green with a straight crest and yellow skin patches on the cheeks.
Crowned and Nicobar Pigeons and a variety of doves, Vulturine and
Crested Guineafowl, various peacock pheasants and firebacks as well
as other pheasants, Ocellated Turkeys, Cereopsis, Orinoco and other
geese, Rad j ah and other shelducks, ducks and teal, macaws, cockatoos,
Amazon and Grey Parrots, Australian and other parrakeets are regu-
larly breeding.
Also in the vicinity of Phoenix Mr. L. M. Ollson, a younger
enthusiast, maintains one of the largest and finest collections of tropical
and subtropical birds to be found in the western world and he is par-
ticularly successful with them. He has built numerous aviaries and
enclosures, all of generous proportions and well planted. A number of
them include ponds and he continues adding to them in a big way.
They are strictly practical and no visitors are permitted to enter the
grounds with the exception of other bird specialists.

All the genera of large ground birds are represented : Ostriches,
grey and white Rheas, Emus and cassowaries. The Ostriches are a
young pair, but all the others have been breeding in 1974. Mr. Ollson
has been especially lucky with his Double-wattled Cassowaries C.
casuarius for he has been able to keep three together, one male and
two females, in a roomy pen about 100 ft. x 100 ft. and planted with
trees and bushes--a most unusual occurrence, for all those who keep
cassowaries have found out how difficult it is to associate even a male
and a female together as a rule, the latter, the larger and fiercer of
the pair, attacks the male and would quickly kill him without swift
intervention and separation. That is the reason for the paucity of
breeding records, but Mr. Ollson's birds, which were raised together,
not only tolerate one another, but they have bred during 1974, the
two females laying fertile eggs and one young one reared.
Sarus, Stanley, Demoiselle and Crowned Cranes breed each season,
but the Wattled Cranes, like those at Cleres, have so far laid infertile
eggs only. The collection of waterfowl and game birds is very impor-
tant, but wisely confined to tropical and subtropical species, most of
them breeding regularly--such is the case with Cereopsis, Orinoco,
shelducks and sheldgeese, Black, Black-necked and Coscoroba Swans
and curiously enough a pair of Whistling Swans rear a brood each
year. Argus, different peacock pheasants and others are doing very
well, but Mr. Ollson's most interesting achievement is his outstanding
success with curassows and other Cracidae. His collection of these
Central and South American birds is no doubt the biggest in existence
and he has reared more of them than anyone else. Crestless Crax
tomentosa, Salvin's C. salvini and Black C. alector Curassows have bred
in his aviaries for the first time in captivity during the past three years
and many young have been reared; also Great C. rubra , Wattled C.
carunculata, Bare-faced C. fasciolata and Blue-billed C. alberti. The
Nocturnal Curassow Nothocrax urumutum has laid, but none have
been reared. Guans and chachalacas of a number of species are kept
and also breed, and I have noted some curious hybrids between a
species of brown guan and a Piping Guan resembling more the former
with numerous white lines, and streaks on the neck, head and mantle.
Mr. Ollson's experiments with curassows and allied species have been
of great value to Dr. D. Amadon and myself in our recently published
monograph of these birds.
There are, moreover, many quail, parrots and parrakeets, doves and
pigeons as well as passerine birds. The collections are constantly grow-
ing and at the present time of threatening extinction of many species
of birds owing to over-shooting and to the destruction of their necessaiy
habitats, the efforts of Mr. Ollson in propagating some of the fast
disappearing forms is an example which should be followed by many
others interested in preserving bird life for future generations.

finches are normally recognised as belonging to the genus Hypochera ,
but as long ago as 1880 it was suggested that Hypochera should be
regarded as a synonym of Vidua (Forbes) and this view was latterly
supported by Delacour (1934 and 1951). However, most authorities
prefer to maintain the status of Hypochera (at least as a subgenus) as
much for the convenience of separating the combassous from the other
parasitic whydahs as anything. By the same token Steganura is con-
sidered a subgenus of Vidua. While discussions on what the genus
might be may seem rather lofty and academic to the aviculturist, the
question of what constitutes a species within the genus is more relevant.
For example, depending on one's source of reference, there may be
anything from two species chalybeata and nigerrima (Nicolai 1964) to
ten.
When I wrote my rather generalised notes on the genus in Cage &amp;
Aviary Birds (Restall 1972) my motivation was to prompt the
average bird keeper to take a more profound interest in his birds.
Combassous generally are kept for decorative purposes in mixed
collections of waxbills and allied finches. As far as I can make out no
attempts are ever made to breed them, and should they ever be bred
no doubt this would be by accident. I briefly related the host/parasite
relationship of firefinches and combassous, and suggested that anyone
with breeding firefinches might well consider including a pair of
combassous in the enclosure with the thought of a parasite-breeding
taking place.
All of this was brought home to me when, in the spring of 1974 I
received a letter from Mr. D. Johns of Luton, Beds., who had followed
my suggestion and successfully bred combassous as a result. I will (with
his permission) summarise my correspondence with Mr. Johns, but
first let me hark back to my opening notes on species identification. As
far as he knew, Mr. Johns' birds were " Combassous ". So I sent a
drawing of an adult male bird with all the alternative diagnostics
marked and, armed with the reply, I only then realised just how
difficult it is to identify one race or species from another. Before anyone
points out that a set of museum skins might have been useful I must
say that the soft parts are just as important as plumage characteristics
and since no two authorities in the world seem to be able to agree
(Friedmann, i960, summarises the confusion admirably) it really boils
down to anyone's guess. However, I finally concluded that the
" species " in the Luton collection was ultramarina , which may well

be a race of H. chalybeata .
Mr. Johns wrote as follows :
" . . . having bred East African Firefinches fairly regularly I introduced a
pair of Gombassous into my aviary that summer. Unfortunately the cock bird
died that winter, but I was able to replace it fairly easily.
No apparent attempt at breeding was seen to be made until last year when
my wife drew my attention to a young bird obviously just out of the nest, its
appearance being that of a Firefinch hen. It was followed two days later by
another youngster of similar appearance which I accepted as being another
Firefinch. These two youngsters were seen being fed by a pair of adult Fire-
finches during which the Combassous appeared to take no interest whatsoever.
Our suspicions were first aroused when the two youngsters started to outgrow
their apparent parents. We then noticed certain plumage changes which in-
cluded stripes across the head and sparrow-type markings on the wings, the
chest feathers getting lighter in colour.
The size by this time was so marked plus the adult Combassous had taken
up position each side of the youngsters whenever they were not being fed by
the Firefinches, that I decided at this point to get a second opinion asking Mr
Dennis Burgess of Luton who very kindly called and inspected the birds. He
agreed with me that the appearance of these youngsters seemed to be that of
young Combassous.
Following their weaning the two youngsters were closely watched and pro-
tected by the adult Combassous but unfortunately I lost one of the young, plus
the cock bird. The remaining bird is now identical to the hen but slightly larger.
It has uttered a call occasionally which sounds very like a cock bird's warning
call. I am looking forward to next year to see if my opinion is proved correct."
Mr. Johns then supplied the following supplementary information :
"aviary
i 8 ft. long, 6 ft. wide, 6 ft. high. First 6 feet covered over top and sides;
second 6 feet covered top and open side and the rest completely open to
weather.
Back of aviary is made up of a wall of broken paving stones providing cavi-
ties for nesting sites. The floor is earth and some grass plus a large Fuchsia bush
and a couple of small conifers, some Privet growing up the wall and there is
a small pond. A small attached shelter (access by two holes) in which two tubes,
thermostatically controlled, keep the temperature at 50 degrees all the time plus
a small 15 watt lamp alight all the time.

Mainly Panicum millet and millet sprays; some canary seed and plenty of
grit and cuttlefish bone. Greenfood, mainly lettuce grown by ourselves.
I have found also that a pool of stagnant water helps to provide much needed
live food. The firefinches take a great interest in the pool especially when it is
washed out: they also spend much time on the floor, presumably catching live
food.
Other birds in the aviary are one pair of Green Singing Finches, one pair
Paradise Whydahs (only purchased in August 1973), four pairs Gold-breasted
Waxbills, one pair Red-eared Waxbills, one pair Diamond Doves, one cock
Weaver, a couple of Java Sparrows plus four pairs of African Firefinches as
described in your articles printed in 'Cage Birds'.

For members of the society who may be interested in the study of
combassous I am summarising the known breeding records below. It
would be superfluous to comment on these in detail, since this was
done admirably by Holger Poulsen in 1956.
?i899. Russ (In Butler 1899). First known breeding. Combassous were
reared by Senegal Firefinches. The combassous bred again, this
time behaving like non-parasitic species.
Mrs. Boyd reported in Bird Notes, and also by Hopkinson in
1926. First British breeding. Combassous were reared by Cordon
Bleus Uraeginthus bengalus.
C. C. Cosgrove ( 1947 ). The Black-winged Combassou chalybeata
was raised by firefinches in an Australian aviary.
A. R. Nielsen (a.m., 1951). First breeding in Denmark. Com-
bassous H. chalybeata reared by Senegal Firefinches.
K. Nielsen. Another Danish breeding, when the Combassous
H. chalybeata built their own nest and reared their own young.
K. Nielsen (a.m., vol. 62, pp. 11--13). A new Danish breeding
result--breeding of the Combassou Hypochera c. chalybeata.
H. Olsen. Yet another Danish breeding. One chalybeata was
reared by firefinches; it was a female which paired back to its
father and the original firefinches obligingly raised a further
two combassous.
The two earlier records were assumed to be for the species chaly-
beata (and presumably the race chalybeata ?).
Whether there are two ( amauropteryx and chalybeata) or three
species ( amauropteryx , chalybeata and funerea) or even more, it seems
abundantly clear that only the black-winged form known as chalybeata
has been bred in captivity. In doing so it has raised all sorts of prob-
lems by its behaviour, for in the wild it apparently is a normal brood-
parasitic Vidua , but in captivity there seems to be no doubt that it has
reverted to a more primitive condition and behaved like a perfectly
normal parental species, building its own nest and rearing its own
brood. For those who like to think that aviculture can often help
science with its problems I find it a perverse joke that in this case the
aviculturist seems to have created more.
One clear lesson should be evident, however, and that is that we
should never forget that few of our aviaries can duplicate natural
conditions, and the corollary is that our birds should not be expected
to behave naturally; the fact that many of them seem to do is a bonus.
For this reason, if aviculture is to be much more than a toy soldiers
kind of interest, as much data as possible should be recorded. In his

notes (i960) Herbert Friedmann was clearly restricted in the con-
clusions he was able to draw on the combassous simply because so little
data had been recorded : in some cases even the species involved was
in doubt.
For aviculturists who might care to attempt breeding the others I list
below the scientific names, and this follows Delacour (1951).

By D. Grenville Roles (Deputy Curator of Birds)
The Red-backed Mousebird Colius castanotus was first bred here in
1967 when, unfortunately, the species was wrongly identified as
C. striatus. The breeding was briefly described by Mr. J. Mallet in the
1967 annual report of the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust.
This original breeding pair, which were acquired in August 1966,
have attempted to breed with varying success every year since then,
with eggs being laid in every month of the year except February.
C. castanotus is quite drably plumaged--principally earth-brown
above with bright chestnut back and rump, light brown to buff under-
parts, earth-brown tail with cream outer vanes on the outer feathers.
The face and forehead are black, speckled with grey and the crest is
brown. Ear-coverts and neck are grey, eyes yellow, upper mandible
black with a grey patch, lower mandible horn coloured and the legs
are coral red.
As stated above the birds first bred in 1967. They were then kept in
a small cage (in the Tropical Bird House) only 3 ft. 6 in. x 3 ft. x 4 ft.;
this was shared by four Red-faced Mousebirds C. indicus which had to
be removed due to the persistent aggression shown to them by the Red-
backed. Their cage was furnished with a large wire cone filled with
leaves, to which the pair were seen to add fresh green leaves from the
twigs which they received daily. A clutch of four eggs was laid, two
of which proved to be infertile, the remaining two hatching after 12-14
days' incubation.
The following information was gained from breeding activities of
progeny of the above pair, housed in a large planted aviary 24 ft. x
12 ft. x 7 ft. which they shared with a pair of Brown Eared Pheasants.
On the occasion of the study the mousebirds built an entire nest for
themselves, whereas previously pairs always used conical wire frames
lined with hessian.
The large bulky nest was constructed principally of coarse straw,
lined with fine grasses and feathers. The clutch of three uniformly off-
white eggs averaged 22 x 17 mm.--this clutch was the only one
measured. The nest was sited four and a half feet from the ground in
the centre of a dense Hebe (Scrophulariaceae) shrub, at which they
were constantly nibbling.
A precise period of incubation was not established for this clutch,
but incubation probably commenced with the laying of the first egg, as
the young hatched on consecutive days. On hatching the pink-fleshed
nestling could be seen to be sparsely covered with greyish down. The
lower mandible was dark, upper mandible yellow as was the entire top

of the head. The eyes were closed.
The adults seemed to brood constantly until the young fledged--and
would set up a shrill clamour when the nest was inspected, remaining
only a yard or so away and complaining loudly,,
At two days old it could be seen that the first chick was developing
very rapidly with the flight feathers showing dark under the skin. When
four days old the chick had its eyes open and was still almost naked,
although the sheathed wing and tail quills were now well developed.
There was also a marked contrast between the yellowish-green upper
mandible, yellowish crown and the pink flesh of the neck and body.
At six days, the inch-long tail feathers were starting to open as were
the flights, coverts and body tracts. The crest was noticeable and the
legs were seen to be darkening; it was also noted that down (from the
pheasants) had been newly added to the nest.
At nine days the chick was alert and watchful, " wheezing " and
squeaking when disturbed and moving around the nest perimeter quite
rapidly. The colour contrast between the yellow upper and black
lower mandibles was very marked. The plumage was developing
rapidly and the tail was now inches long.
When 11 days old the chick left the nest when it was inspected,
although still unable to fly. It now resembled a miniature adult being
cinnamon beneath, earth-brown above, with slightly darker upper back
and head, and with chestnut feathers appearing through black down
on the back and rump. The wing-coverts were lightly scalloped in pale
brown. At 14 days the chick flew from the nest.
The mousebirds were given a diet of ripe fruits, hard-boiled egg and
leaves (chiefly hawthorn). They occasionally ate mealworms.
Since 1967 we have reared 50 Red-backed Mousebirds, 40 of them
from the wild-caught pair. Twenty-eight birds have been exported to
five different collections in Europe and at present we are holding three
separate colonies, of one breding pair and current year's young in
each.
The Striated Coly Colius striatus was first bred in this country by G. H,
Gurney in 1914, but Jersey Zoological Park's breeding of C. castanotus from
1967 onwards appears to be the only recorded success with that species.

THE BAND-TAILED PIGEON
Columha fasciata
By Carl Naether (Encino, California, U.S.A.)
At the beginning of this essay, it is well to emphasise the fact that the
Band-tailed Pigeon is California's only wood pigeon, the other one, the
Passenger Pigeon Columha ( Ectopistes ) migratoria , well known to this
</figure>

day, having become extinct many years ago. Even today, " old timers "
so-called, living in remote mountain regions and not being familiar with
wild pigeons, their species and subspecies, will confuse Band-tailed
Pigeons with Passenger Pigeons, with the result that we read reports
in small-town newspapers from the far-back country of the occurrence
of Passenger Pigeons. This confusion on the part of the "average
observer" is quite understandable, since both wood pigeons were /are
fairly large, active birds. Moreover, there is a similarity so far as
distribution, flight demeanour, and feeding habits are concerned, both
pigeons flying considerable distances in search of sustenance, frequently
changing their local habitats as the need for food dictated. In search
of their favourite food--acorns--Band-tailed Pigeons are known to
travel often hundreds of miles.
The accompanying photographs will afford the reader a fairly good
idea of the general appearance of this desirable game-bird; it is about
the size of a common domestic pigeon such as the racing homer. Its
head, neck and underparts are greyish-purple, fading into white below
the tail; back, wings and tail are greyish-brown; in the middle of the
tail appears a black band, hence the name of this lively bird. The back
of the neck is conspicuously decorated with a white band, followed by
a shimmering, golden green, sizeable patch. The eyes, bill, feet and
legs are yellow and the beak is black-tipped. There is but little differ-
ence between the appearance of the male and the female, except that
the latter is somewhat smaller in size and paler in colour. In young
Band-tailed Pigeons, the white neck band and the metallic neck patch
are lacking.
This attractive wood pigeon roams far and wide over western North
America, from south-west British Columbia south to Cape San Lucas
and Central America. In the United States it is found in the following
states : Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, West Texas, and especially in
California. The availability of acorns will prompt it to change its
current habitat from one region to another. Thus, quite some years
ago, a most bountiful acorn crop in the forest valleys of the Santa
Barbara Mountains attracted huge flocks of Band-tailed Pigeons. They
came not only from Northern California, but from distant states,
including Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia--masses of

pigeons, conservatively estimated at half a million, which thus were
able to gorge themselves on their favourite acorns for a considerable
period of time. This enormous concentration was featured in many
local newspapers as a very unusual natural happening, and it brought
literally hundreds of hunters from near and far to this beautiful Santa
Barbara region, intent on bagging as many of these highly desirable
and delectable game-birds as possible. Sad to report, a small group of
hunters shot 1,560 Band-tailed Pigeons on a single day's outing! A
butcher, in the employ of a San Francisco market, shot 280 in a single
day under a single oak tree ! This senseless killing of untold numbers of
this pigeon so incensed bird- and nature-loving residents of this region
as to call the attention of local and state authorities to this awful
slaughter, who soon after issued legal ordinances stopping completely
all shooting and catching of Band-tailed Pigeons for a period of five
years so as to afford them a much needed opportunity to recoup their
tremendous losses.
Usually the breeding season of the Band-tailed Pigeon runs from
February till October, with the largest number of nestings being
between the months of May to July. For California the earliest reported
nesting date is 1st February and the latest 1st November. Some authori-
ties report nests a considerable distance apart from one another; others
report the opposite fact. Thus a member of the U.S. Forest Service in
Tucson, Arizona, counted no fewer than 14 nests in one large Douglas
Fir near a spring, and in the following year the very same tree accom-
modated 17 nests. In a study of nesting in Strawberry Canyon in the
San Francisco Bay area, no evidence of communal nesting was dis-
covered. In this region all conifer and oak groves were utilised for nest-
ing, and heights of nests ranged from 7 ft. in an alder tree to 40 ft. in
a pine tree. Always the nest tree stood above a small slope, affording
the birds increased height and a broad view of the surrounding country
when leaving their nests. Moreover, each nest tree was close to a clear-
ing, which greatly facilitated access to the nest. The majority of the
nests were set on horizontal limbs, about 2 to 5 ft. from the trunk.
Usually the nesting platform is set in the dense foliage of oaks, pines,
and other trees, not easily detectable by predators from above, as was
the nest built in a sycamore tree on a residential street in the city of
Pasadena, pointed out to this writer by a friend.
Various researchers in the field seem to aver that the male of this
species selects the nesting place and that the female builds the nest,
usually in from three to six days. As with most kinds of pigeon, it is a
loosely constructed platform of dry sticks and small tree branches,
laid criss-cross rather carelessly; moreover, it is so placed as to benefit
from all-day shade. Like other wild wood pigeons, Bandtails use the
same nesting site on the same tree branch again and again, provided, of
course, that at this location they have not been interfered with by

predators from below or from above. The writer's foreign pigeons
follow the same custom, using the identical nest site year in and year
out.
Usually only one egg, white in colour, is laid, and brooded for from
18 to 21 days. A rare exception was a nest built of moss and green
leaves, containing two eggs, and set on the forest floor between two
large tree roots. Bandtails are very cautious and circumspect birds that
sit tightly on their nests, which they leave very reluctantly at the last
moment when danger threatens. Like all members of the pigeon family,
male and female take turns at incubating the single egg, the male doing
duty in the morning from about 10 o'clock until 4 or 5 o'clock in the
afternoon and the female brooding the remainder of the time. Reports
from the field would suggest that each pair maintains a fairly regular
schedule. During the initial stage of incubation the egg is turned about
three times, which number increases to eight or nine times with the
approach of hatching. If enemies, as for instance squirrels, threaten the
nest, the sitting pigeon will assume a typical pigeon-like defensive
posture, striking with bristling wings at the intruder, at the same time
grunting displeasure. If the bird is forced to leave the nest, it will
usually drop to the forest floor, where it may feign wing injury; how-
ever, such behaviour is rather rare. When flying to their nests, Bandtails
prefer not to approach them directly, but always half a dozen feet or
more below the branch on which the nest rests. Often they will perch
there for some little time, apparently making sure that no enemy has
spotted them. Then they will climb to the nest limb by limb round the
tree in a spiralling fashion. By means of this remarkable, instinctive
behaviour, they endeavour to keep their nest location safe and secret.
Band-tailed squabs are fed, like all young pigeons, by regurgitation.
When very young, they are fed more often than when they are older;
in the latter case only once or twice a day. They may leave their nest
at the age of from four to five weeks.
Even though acorns, picked off the ground and swallowed whole,
appear to be the preferred food of Bandtails, berries of a wide variety
as well as tree blossoms also are taken. In the Strawberry Canyon sur-
vey, alluded to above, the blossoms of the elderberry were at first the
staple diet of these pigeons, to be later replaced by the green berries,
and still later by the ripe ones. Their young were raised on this simple
diet. Bandtails remain in a given territory as long as the supply of
berries or other food lasts, instead of migrating to some other location
yielding perhaps a variety of berries and blossoms. Almost parrot-like,
Bandtails will crawl, frequently hanging upside down, amongst tree
branches and bushes to pick the berries off and every berry is eagerly
taken, many times unripe ones. While elderberries are the favourites of
Bandtails, the fruit of Cascara sagrada and also that of the coffeeberry
are not overlooked. Other kinds of berries include the following :

huckleberries, salal berries, salmon berries, and madrones. During any \
season of the year manzanita berries, whether ripe or unripe, are avidly
taken. In case of necessity, Band-tailed Pigeons will feed also on the
Christmas berry. In the springtime when but few berries are in season,
these pigeons will pluck the tender leaves of oaks and manzanitas. In
years past, there have been complaints voiced by farmers that Bandtails
did much damage to freshly-sown oat fields. However, since the wood
pigeons neither scratch nor dig, but simply pick up seed lying on top of
the soil, such complaints are hardly justified.
The cooing of the Band-tailed Pigeon has been likened to the call
of an owl, but careful observers maintain that its quality resembles that
of the cooing of the Rock Pigeon and other common pigeons. " Sing-
ing " males commonly give voice to a series of from three to a dozen
coos, rather weak and low, and not audible for any considerable dis-
tance. These calls " whoo-hoo-whoo-hoo " are not easy to describe.
Some observers report much cooing going on in the early morning
hours, while others found these pigeons to be vocalising mainly in the
late afternoon hours. In their cooing, the birds seem to adhere to a
regular time schedule, they stop cooing with the advent of incubation. ^
Another type of vocalising of this pigeon is, for want of a more suit-
able descriptive term, called " chirping "--it is a sort of wheezing
sound, or else somewhat like the chirping of a cricket. This pigeon is &apos;
said to utter this sound with closed beak during display flights. Young
Bandtails at the time of feeding are said to voice a peeping call, which
may be likened to a similar begging call sounded by young domestic j
pigeons. Most cooing by males is closely related to courtship and j
mating--it is an excited calling to the female, and it establishes the sex j
of the bird.
Though attractive, lively and hardy in captivity, Band-tailed
Pigeons are relatively rare in aviaries, in all probability because being
game-birds, official permits are required for their keeping, exchanging,
and selling. Most aviculturists do not wish to trouble themselves with
so much " red tape ". However, there are sincere lovers of wild pigeons
who enjoy the presence of these lovely native birds in their aviaries. 1
They are easily maintained in good health and breeding condition on
a diet of mixed large grains, obtainable at any feedstore, and the usual
pigeon grit. Band-tailed Pigeons have frequently been crossed with
various breeds of domestic pigeons. Being good flyers, they should be
accommodated in spacious aviaries, where if not disturbed, they are
likely to nest successfully.

R. E. CORNHILL--BREEDING ATTEMPT BY SPARROW HAWKS 85
A BREEDING ATTEMPT BY A PAIR OF SPARROW HAWKS
Accipiter nisus
By R. E. CoRNHiLL (Tiptree, Essex)
Introduction
The Sparrow Hawk which was formerly probably the most abundant
! raptor in the British Isles, declined rapidly in the early 1960's, leaving
! the present remnant population in eastern England and a much
: reduced density over the remainder of the country. Mid-Wales and
Scotland now constitute the stronghold of the British population,
1 particularly in reafforested areas. This dramatic population reduction
is almost certainly attributable to toxic insecticides which resulted in
raptor deaths, sterility, loss of faculties, thinning egg shells, etc.
The females of most species of birds of prey are larger than the
males, but in Sparrow Hawks this characteristic is particularly pro-
nounced, although size is subject to considerable individual variation.
The female is 14 in.-16 in. long and weighs between 8 and 12 oz.
whereas the male (sometimes called the "musket") is 11 in.-i3 in.
long and weighs between \\ and 7^ oz. This considerable disparity in
size, together with the species' highly strung temperament can provide
problems during the introductory period, the smaller male being at risk.
If mature individuals are to be introduced, it is preferable to
establish the male in the breeding accommodation for 2 or 3 months
prior to the introduction of the female; by doing so, the male regards
the flight as his territory and this improves his chances of survival when
the female joins him. A better proposition is to rear a pair of young
birds (eyasses) in the flight that they are to occupy as adults; this
normally averts fighting providing food is supplied in abundance. It is
also thought that this practice improves the chances of a breeding
attempt being made when the birds reach maturity.
Captive Breeding Records
Sparrow Hawks were bred in the Plymouth aviary of Dr. L. H.
Hurrell in 1971, a total of four being reared and in 1972 a single male
was reared. Herr Herron has also successfully bred this species in his
aviaries in Germany in 1969 and 1970. Accounts of these events and
other (unsuccessful) attempts appear in " Captive Breeding of Diurnal
Birds of Prey" Nos. 2 and 3, released jointly by the Hawk Trust and
the British Falconers' Club.
Diet
In the wild Sparrow Hawks prey mainly on birds and due to their
sexual dimorphism the sexes probably occupy different ecological
niches. Food species range in size from Blue Tits to Wood Pigeons,
although only the larger female would prey on the larger species. Thus,
by the sexes largely predating upon different species of birds, it is

probable that a denser population can exist than would otherwise be
possible.
I have found difficulty in simulating the diet of wild hawks, but have
found day old chicks of domestic poultry to be completely satisfactory.
Not only are my adult birds fed exclusively on chicks, but I have
successfully reared young birds on this diet; no additives or supplements
are employed.
Normally the pair of Sparrow Hawks under discussion consume
six chicks per day, but this increased to seven for two weeks prior to
laying and fell to five during incubation. I always feed more than is
required and monitor what is actually eaten; this does of course
necessitate removing uneaten food every two or three days. It can be
deduced that if a chick weighs i|-2 oz., the daily intake of 5-6 oz. for
a bird weighing 11 oz. is fairly high; no doubt this can be accounted
for by the considerable amount of nervous energy expended by these
excitable birds.

Aviary Design

<bodyText confidence="0.988109607142857" page_id="56381395"  page_num="86" year="" vol="">
Due to the neurotic and erratic nature of Sparrow Hawks the design
of their aviary accommodation warrants special consideration, the two
major requirements being a layout to provide a sense of security and
which can be serviced with a minimum of disturbance.
From the sketch it can be seen that half of the area is fully enclosed
in the form of a purpose-built shed; in addition the back, end and half
of the roof of the open flight are close boarded; these two areas are
joined by a hatchway 30 in. wide x 18 in. high which can be closed
at will. It has been found that the shed provides a retreat into which
the birds can retire when approached by anything unfamiliar or
disturbing, thus stress is greatly reduced and the birds are far less
likely to fly madly onto the wire.
The flooring consists of a 6 in. layer of sharp sand and a 2 ft.
diameter x 4 in. deep container provides bathing facilities. Natural
branches, with the bark stripped are employed as perches and two
stone perches are provided adjacent to the bath. Perches are positioned
so as to encourage the maximum amount of exercise and to permit
sun-bathing.
As can be seen in Fig. 1 a nest platform, consisting of a wire netting
covered wooden frame, was erected in the most secluded corner of
each section; both were 54 in. from the ground. Natural twigs approxi-
mately J in. in diameter were woven into these platforms.
Breeding Behaviour
From the beginning of May 1974, the male became aggressive and
began to assume dominance for the first time in the two years that the
pair had been together; also both birds uttered a new call when
excitedly flying backwards and forwards. On 13th May the male was
observed to carry a few sticks to nest site A and consequently between

200 and 300 birch twigs J in.-- |in. diameter x 6 in.-i2 in. long were ,
scattered on the outer aviary floor. Material was continuously added ,
to nest site A by the male until 18th May, when he commenced
carrying sticks to site B. The female was not seen to take any part in
nest construction until 21st May, but from that date she probably 1
accounted for 70% of the material added to site B.
Nest material was scattered on the floor of the flight daily, totalling
600-700 sticks in all, smaller twigs *4 6 in-% in. diameter x 4 in.- 8 in.
long, some with leaves attached being provided during the last few ;
days of the construction cycle. The nest was apparently complete on
25th May and the female roosted on the nest from then onwards. An
inspection by torchlight during the night of 25th revealed that nest A
was completely destroyed, but nest B consisted of a poorly constructed
pyramid 2 ft. in diameter x 9 in.-io in. high with a depression 1 in.
deep in the top. In comparison to nests built in the wild, this nest was
larger but far more roughly built, constituting little more than a pile
of sticks, with softer material such as leaves and dry grass placed on the
top.
On 1 st June the first egg was observed, having presumably been laid
during the evening or night of 31st May. By now the pair had become
very aggressive and it was no longer possible to enter their aviary
without being attacked; the male was even observed to fly at a passing
cat.
With the exception of two 15-20 minute periods the female spent
the ensuing days standing and lying on the nest until the 5th when
it was assumed that incubation commenced.
When inspected on the night of 8th June, the nest contained two
and possibly three eggs, the uncertainty arising from the female's
unwillingness to more than slightly raise her body when approached
to within 2 ft. by a torch. Incubation, as far as is known, was carried
out solely by the female, who left the nest for a 3-5 minute spell every
3-4 hours during which time she fed, stretched, preened and occasion-
ally bathed. Immediately the female vacated the nest the male assumed
a guard posture on the nest rim and he may have brooded during these
periods although this was never established; he always returned to the
outside aviary on the female's return.
From 16th June the male was observed to pluck chicks and call to
the female, after varying periods the female would appear and collect
the chick from the male's feet; he was, however, never witnessed to
perform the beak-to-beak food pass as is usual with raptors. By this
date it was established that only two eggs had been laid and it was
also observed that the female's moult was well advanced, with five pairs
of primaries and the two central rectrices already cast.
The incubation period for Sparrow Hawks varies from 34 to 37 days
with 36 days seeming to be the norm; therefore a discreet daily inspec-

tion was made from 6th July. However, by 14th July it was evident
that the eggs were not going to hatch.
For fear of causing stress which might adversely affect future
breeding attempts, it was decided to allow the female to continue to
sit and not remove the eggs; however, one disappeared on 21st July
and the remaining egg, which proved to be infertile, was removed on
23rd July. The female finally gave up sitting on 25th July.
After allowing the hawks a period to settle after their breeding
attempt, the nest was dismantled on 10th August; this revealed frag-
ments of egg shell embedded in the nest lining also a complete egg
buried 2 in. below the surface and this also proved to be infertile.

The pair were never observed copulating, although this could have
occurred in the house where they were not visible. The bouts of excited
flying and unusual calling between 5th and 27 th May could have been
an accompaniment to mating; however, observations drawn from my
other pairs of birds of prey suggest that captive raptors usually mate
on the same perch and in the same position.
The pair will remain together and it is hoped that a more successful
attempt will be made next year. I consider that this breeding attempt
is significant in that it suggests that the successful breeding of highly
strung hawks in a small garden should prove possible, given that an
amount of common sense is employed. It would also seem that the
considerable problems affecting captive breeding as put forward by
some falconers are greatly exaggerated.
I should point out that Sparrow Hawks are protected in this country,
appearing on the First Schedule which imposes the maximum penalty
for disturbance of the nest site and for the trapping and killing of the
birds at any time.

NESTING AND HAND-RAISING OF THE
HYAGINTHINE MACAW

Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus
By Ralph G. Small (Brookfield, Illinois, U.S.A.)
The female Hyacinthine Macaw was purchased by the Chicago
Zoological Park on 30th June, 1949 as an immature bird; the other,
also a female, died in 1966. These two did a lot of mutual preening, 1
etc. It was not known until after the second one died, that it was a ,
female and neither laid while they were together.
In January of 1967 the female Hyacinthine paired off with a Red
and Yellow Macaw and on 30th April laid an egg, but it was broken,
so we had no way of knowing if it was fertile.
In April the zoo purchased another Hyacinthine hoping that it 1
would be a male : it had been imported 12th May, 1956, by Mesker
Park, Evansville, Indiana and its age is unknown.
On 23rd April, 1968, the new bird was put in with the female; they
got along well from the start and in June the two were put in an out-
side cage for the summer. If I paid any attention to the male, the 1
female would pick a fight with him and I still have to be careful that
I play with the female first or she bites him.
On 16th February, 1969, they wouldn't let me in the cage to clean.
On the 25th, I saw the first copulation and this was repeated up until
the time the first egg was laid. The second egg was laid about 20th
March and both were clear. A second clutch was laid on 13th and
16th May and on 13th June the first baby hatched; the other egg
was clear. On 16th June the baby was gone and I don't believe the
female fed this one.
On 7th July, 1969, the first of the third clutch was laid. I don't
know when the second was laid, but both of these eggs were clear.
At this time I removed the barrel to give them a rest, but on
23rd and 27th August the female dropped eggs from her perch.
In January of 1970 I was transferred from the Parrot House : I
heard that the macaws laid again but with no results.
On 4th October, 1970, I was lucky enough to purchase the pair. I
fixed up a cage in the basement of my house 7 x 14x5 feet high with
a 28 inch partition across the back. A 50 gal. steel drum laying on its
side with the upper third of the top cut out serves as a nesting box.
It is half filled with tan bark and about a gallon of water is added to
give it the proper humidity. There is a door in the back of the cage
and when this door is opened inward, it closes off the nest barrel
partition from the main cage so you can work or check eggs. The
feeding or cleaning door in the front is really two doors; the first has
the food and water cups attached near the bottom and the second is

short so that the cups go under it. This way the birds only have a small
area to get out. The room is thermostatically controlled and tempera-
ture runs about 74 0 F. to 8o* F. the year round. There is a humidifier
running in the winter and a dehumidifier in summer to control the
humidity. There is a time clock to turn the lights on and off; they go
on at 7 a.m. and off about 10.15 p.m. and then there is a 15 minute
dim light. This operates the year round.
When the pair was introduced to this cage they acted as if they were
coming back to an old remembered place. The male started to inspect
and go into the barrel after a short time. It was the same barrel used
at the zoo.
During October, November and December 1970, they did a lot of
working in the barrel, courting, preening and copulating. On 5th Jan-
uary, 1971, the first egg was laid; the second was laid on 9th January,
but when checked on 8th February, both were found to be infertile.
On 1 st and 4th March, eggs were laid again. When these were
checked on 15th March, one was found to be fertile; the other was
clear and on 30th March the egg hatched. When found the baby was
cold; it weighed 18.6 grams. The clear egg weighed 24.5 grams. The
baby was taken upstairs to be hand-raised. This baby " Primo ", took
almost a full year before it could be said it was really on its own.
29th April, 1971, a very small unfertilized egg was laid and on
7th December, 1971, the first egg of a new clutch. The second egg was
laid on 10th December. When checked on the 25th December again
only one was found to be fertile. On 4th January, 1972, this egg
hatched; the baby was found about 7 p.m. The parents seemed to be
taking care of the baby so I decided to leave it with the mother. On
5th January at noon, when checked, the baby had a full crop of a
yellow, soft milky substance : next day at noon the crop was again
full of food and on 8th January saw the female feeding the baby; she
held the whole head in the tip of the bill and gently moved her head
up and down. I believe she pushes the food down into the bill of the
baby with her tongue. Food comes out on both sides of the baby's head
and makes a real mess in the nest and on the young one. At two weeks
it weighed 156 grams. This baby cried very little and usually only when
the female was there to feed or was feeding it. Weight at three weeks
was 302.5 grams; four weeks 464 grams, 5 weeks 659 grams, 6 weeks
643 grams. I took the baby from the nest on 14th February at 41 days,
for the mother had been plucking it; some of the small pin feathers
were cut so short that they would bleed.
On 21 st March, the first egg of a new clutch was laid; the second
on 24th March and both were clear.
On 1st May, the first of the third clutch was laid and on 5th May
the second. On 18th May I checked the eggs and found one fertile;
on 29th May this egg hatched. At two weeks the baby weighed

189.5 grams, 3 weeks 347.5 grams, 4 weeks 533 grams, 5 weeks 668.5
grams. On 23rd July I took it and locked the parents out of the nesting
area. The baby was again being plucked and was very dirty. The
mother gets food all over the baby while feeding and her breast is
always dirty with food; the inside of the barrel gets wet and dirty with
regurgitated food. On 31st July this baby weighed 1,400 grams, a little
over 3 pounds and it is the biggest of the three young ones.
On 10th July, 1972, I cleaned cage and again opened up nesting
area. The first of the new clutch was laid on 8th August, second egg
12th August, 1972. 22nd August removed the barrel; both eggs were
clear.
On 20th January, 1973, let pair back into nesting area. They had
been moulting since they were locked out. 26th April, 1973, first of new
clutch; second egg, 30th April. On 28th May one egg hatched; the

1973. On 18th September, I found both fertile. This was the first time
both have been fertile. 5th October, one chick hatched; the other was
dead in shell. On 23rd October I took away the baby because workers
were putting a new siding on the house. This young one weighed
243 grams. On 25th November, 1973, the first and only egg of fourth
clutch and this hatched on 23rd December. The egg dried out after
baby pipped and it was trapped so couldn't get out. We peeled the
shell off and placed the baby back in the nest at 10 p.m.. At 4.30
on the 24th, they had not fed and the baby was cold so we took it to
hand-raise. This one weighed 17.8 grams. We believe that because the
baby stayed in the egg too long it could not raise its head up to be fed.
It is at the time of writing 4 weeks old and doing fine. When we took
this chick and locked the pair out of the nesting area and they pro-
ceeded to moult.
The food I am now giving this pair is 7 parts large, grey sunflower
seed, 1 part pigeon feed, 1 part pigeon chow, \ part of a mixture of
50% canary seed and 50% large white millet. Daily they get a small
handful of raw peanuts in the shell and 10 Purina 25% protein Monkey
Chow pellets. Apple, carrots, orange and grapes are given. Escarole is
given as green food. Liquid vitamin Vi Syneral at 06. cc, to two quarts
of water with a little powdered calcium is given daily; also gravel is
given daily.
I do not consider this a complete success because the parents will
not take care of the baby totally. There is just too much going on
around them that makes them nervous and I think this is what causes
the plucking. I do have three beautiful hand-raised babies that know
how to get into all kinds of trouble around the house to prove that,

Phlogophilus hemileucurus
By R. J. Elgar (Manchester)
The distribution of the Ecuadorian Piedtail is given by de Schauen-
see (1970) as the tropical forest around the headwaters of the River
Napo, eastern Ecuador.
This species is very rare in captivity and to my knowledge the two
examples I have owned have been the only ones to reach England
alive.
Here is a description of the bird : the crown is greenish-brown, rest
of upperparts grass-green, throat and breast are white with green spots;
a white band goes across the centre of the breast, abdomen is white.
The two centre feathers of the tail are bronze-green; the rest have
white bases and broad white tips with diagonal stripe of dark brown.
All upper plumage including the two central tail feathers has a slight
shining effect. The rest of the plumage is dull and non-metallic. The
bill is black. A white post-ocular spot. Legs and feet are whitish with
dark grey bands across the feet.
The first example I owned came to this country in a small ship-
ment from Ecuador which Mr M. W. Clifford imported in early May
1972. I purchased this a few days later. It was very healthy and I
experienced no difficulty in settling it in; it commenced its first moult in
late September 1972 completing it some fourteen weeks later at the
end of December. This was a full moult and in 1973 it did not have
a complete moult, but in September and October of that year it did
drop several feathers. On the 5th May 1974 I was fortunate enough
to acquire another Piedtail from a dealer in Yorkshire.
From observing these birds for several weeks I came to the conclu-
sion that the first one was a female and the second a male; unfor-
tunately at the end of May 1974 I found the female dead in its cage.
On the 30th July 1974 I found several body feathers of the male
Piedtail in its cage and at the time of writing, which is August 1974, this
bird is in a full moult. From observing the female for two years and
the male for three months I have found that these birds are extremely
timid, especially the female, and they must be caged individually at all
times. The cages I use for my small hummingbirds measure 42 inches
long 16 inches high and 16 inches deep, with a natural perch at each
end. In the centre of the cage floor an empty upturned one pound jam
jar with a saucer placed on top filled with water for bathing. I have
found that both male and female are very keen bathers, bathing two

or three times a day.
If the Piedtail is released into a mixed flight of hummingbirds it
spends its time flying very low down or hiding in plants. After a very
short time it gets distressed and if not returned to its cage I feel sure
it would die. I have found Piedtails to be extremely insectivorous;
they will spend long periods of the day hunting and catching fruit
flies on which they are very dependent in their diet and when there is
a shortage of flies there is a definite loss of condition and body weight.
Here is a description of the method by which the male takes fruit flies :
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.794971" page_id="56381405"  page_num="94" year="" vol="">
1. Picking them from any surface, i.e. walls and floor of cage.
When taking them from the floor he will catch the flies and land on
the floor at the same time, using his tail for balance he will flick his
bill in the air swallowing the fly. If there are more on the floor he will
scurry after them, part running, part flying until he has caught them
all. When taking flies from the wall of the cage, he will take the fly
in the bill and in reverse flight, dropping slowly, will swallow it.
2. Hawking flies only on rare occasions, usually when there are
none on the walls of the cage.
3. He will land on the fruit fly cultures which are housed in empty

<bodyText confidence="0.958257038461538" page_id="56381405"  page_num="94" year="" vol="">
margarine tubs in his cage. He puts his bill into the dry bananas flicking
them from side to side disturbing the flie#. As newly hatched are unable
to fly he will chase after them across the floor, as in the first method.
I cannot find any reference to the life of the Ecuadorian Piedtail in
the wild : could it be that this bird takes insects on the ground chasing
and scurrying through the vegetation after them? This bird also pre-
fers to perch when taking nectar.
Flight Perching and Sleeping Postures
In hunting and hawking insects the flight is very similar to that of
a butterfly with very jerky slow wing-beat, tail fanned, and continual
bobbing of head.
In straight normal flight the wing-beat is quite rapid, flying for
short periods then gliding for one or two yards then followed by
another burst of wing-beats. The flight is very similar to that of the
Speckled Hummingbird Adelomyia melanogenys.
When perched and active the bird will continually bob its head
fanning its tail and moving its body from side to side. When sleeping I
have found this species to use both feet on the perch; the only time
I have witnessed it using one is when scratching and preening.
Call and Song
The call of both male and female is " Tic tic-tic tic " uttered through
the day when active. The male song is " Ghir chir-ziss ziss-chir chir-
ziss-ziss. " At present I have only heard and not witnessed this song,
so I don't know whether there is any display with the song, for the
bird stops singing the moment I enter the bird room. Observing the
female for two years, I have also witnessed from her a long drawn out

piping call and I think this is a warning or aggression call to the hum-
mingbirds in the flight. She always perched as close to the wire front
as she could, facing out with the bill wide open and the tail fanned
out when making this call.

It is hardly necessary to stress that an essential factor in the success-
ful keeping and breeding of birds is their proper nutrition. The
standards of feeding farm animals are well designed and, no doubt,
internationally known, but those of wild birds kept in captivity are not
in general sufficiently researched and established. While many com-
petent studies on various species have been published, some others are
not sufficiently detailed, consisting of generalisations. Naturally every
conscientious aviculturist tries to keep his birds in an efficient way so
that they not only live long and thrive, but that they breed, not once
or so, but generation after generation, for now that more and more
countries enact strict protection laws, fewer of the formerly easily
obtained birds are now offered by importers and it becomes increas-
ingly necessary for aviary bred birds of the best quality to take the
place of the imported ones. Therefore it is of the greatest importance
that we share our experiences punctually and in detail with avicul-
turists all over the world so that all are able to provide their birds with
the best available foodstuffs and general care. Naturally some of the
foods described are not universally obtainable, but if information on
their composition is given, those who cannot get the original can
provide the best available substitutes. I appreciate, of course, that the
precise analysis of proprietary foods may not always be known to the
aviculturist and all too little is known about the wide variety of food
items eaten by the birds in the wild state.
I give some examples from the periodicals to show the lack of detail
too often given, though admittedly in instances where the birds did not
touch the food, this would not matter so much. Goodwin 1963 wrote
that Java Sparrows did not touch " soft-food " he refers to Radtke who
reported that " these birds refuse to eat any kind of soft food ".
Naether 1951 gave " powerful soft food " besides other foodstuffs to his
manakins, while Bahr 1965 had good results with his manakins by

giving them " Alexva I extra 55 and " Nectarmil ". Blacktopp 1969
mentions " Farex baby food " and " Avivite Graves 1973 " Vionate 55
and " Pablum baby cereal Clear 1968 " Sluis 55 and " Stimulite " for
soft-billed birds while Terhune 1973 writes " the standard soft-bill and
nectarine diets" for Paradise Tanagers. An article in AVIDATA 1973
mentions " Vetanul ", " Nutrigain " as foods. Vitamin and carotenoid
additives such as Abidec or Garophyl are mentioned by name, but it is
not always made clear that this is what they are. I found the best
description of foods for soft-billed birds in Roots' (1970) but the author
draws our attention to the fact that further investigation of percentages
of ingredients is required. There are no doubt many other valuable
contributions to knowledge of avian nutritional needs, Goodwin 1971
being one that gives sound practical advice, for it is one thing to offer
birds what is good for them and very often another to get them to eat it.
Apart from the birds that have become domesticated, it is evident
that others such as most waterfowl, pheasants and some parrakeets are
dietetically adequately provided for in captivity, for they breed success-
fully from generation to generation, but the record in insectivorous
species is in need of improvement.
The " softfood " on which I have kept and bred Java Sparrows and
Gouldian Finches over a long period contains hard-boiled egg, grated
raw carrot, two kinds of baby food, oat flakes, minerals and vitamins in
the proportions shown in the tables. This food is given in addition to
seeds and green food, of course, and the Java Sparrows eat mealworms,
but the Gouldian Finches do not. The vitamin compound is mixed with
the grated hard-boiled eggs, the minerals, Oriza, Maltiron and oat
flakes are then added; the sequence of mixing is important, for in this
way the Maltiron which has a high milk powder content will not make
the mixture sticky, but will mix with and adhere to the egg. The grated
carrot is the last to be added, having been squeezed out a little if need
be. As can be seen from Table 4 the food contains nearly 30% carbo-
hydrate, 10% protein and about 6 % fat and the calorie content per
100 grammes is 223.
The proportions of carbohydrate and protein may seem small, but
my experience shows that the mixture is adequate for the needs of
Java Sparrows and Gouldian Finches, not only as a supplement to the
adult diet, but also for the rearing of robust young. These two species
cannot, of course, really be considered insectivorous, though they do in
the wild state eat some insect life as well as both ripe and unripe seeds
and, as is well known, many " seed-eaters " take quantities of insect
life when rearing their young.
I should like to make some contribution to progress in knowledge of
the dietetic requirements of birds, complex though they are in most
instances, and will try to do so if sufficient detailed information becomes
available.

Due to growing opposition among protectionists, it has become
increasingly difficult to export live birds from South and Central
American countries. This has resulted in a decrease in the numbers of
tanagers reaching west European countries. Those which have come
in have been mostly from Ecuador and Brazil, with small consignments
from Golombia and Surinam also.
As well as the more common species, some very unusual tanagers
arrived; rare not only in aviculture but also in their natural habitat,
e.g. a Yellow-collared Ghlorophonia Chlorophonia flavirostris , several
Grey and Gold Tanagers Tangara palmeri and a Black-chested Moun-
tain-tanager Buthraupis eximia .
The following list gives the rare and more interesting species which
were included in these imports :

The Yellow-collared or Green and Yellow Chlorophonia Chloro -
phonia flavirostris has always been a much discussed species. Only two
tanager species have a salmon to red bill, legs and feet: the Grass-
green Tanager Chlorornis riefferii (red to brownish red) and the
Yellow-collared Chlorophonia (salmon to yellowish salmon); this chlo-
rophonia is, by the way, very scarce in museum skin collections. Most
information regarding this extraordinary tanager has been gained
through observations made on aviary specimens (Conway 1962).
The Yellow-collared Chlorophonia which I purchased in March
1974 belongs to the Ecuadorian subspecies. Also belonging to the same
subspecies are those owned by the New York Zoo (1962; 2 specimens),
E. M. Boehm (1962; 1 male), Mrs. K. M. Scamell (1968; 1 male)
(Scamell 1969, with colour plate) and some 15 or so specimens of
both sexes imported during 1972 into Denmark, West Germany and
England (Norgaard-Olesen 1973 and 1975, with colour plate of a
pair).
When purchased, the Yellow-collared Chlorophonia was immature;
last September it moulted and attained male plumage. When juvenile,
the bird resembled a female, being grass-green with the centre of lower
breast, belly and under tail-coverts yellow; bill, legs and feet salmon.
Adult males are grass-green with the upper back crossed by a broad
yellow collar; the lower breast and belly yellow is separated from the
green upper breast by a broken narrow band of chestnut, only two
chestnut patches remaining at each side of the neck. The upper and
under tail-coverts are also yellow, fonning a ring around the base of
the tail. The iris is white, and the bill, legs and feet are salmon. When
comparing my bird with the males depicted in colour in the Avicul-
tural Magazine (vol. 75, no. 1, 1969) and in Tanagers (vol. II, plate
15), the chestnut patches on the sides of the breast are more extensive
and the yellow band on the mantle is not as wide. In confinement the
colour of the orbital ring, the bill and the feet tends to fade.
The male Blue-hooded Euphonia Euphonia musica which I pur-
chased in May 1974, belongs to the Mexican subspecies elegantissima.
It was amongst a consignment of Red-legged Honeycreepers Cyanerpes
cyaneus. It differs from the Brazilian subspecies aureata , which I
described last year (Ingels 1974) in that it has a dark chestnut forehead
and brownish orange-red instead of orange-yellow underparts.
I have heard the song of this euphonia and can vouch that it is aptly
named "euphonia musica" or musical euphonia. Shortly after purchase
I placed the bird in a large cage in the garden, thus allowing me to
take colour slides in full sunlight. While thus engaged, a young House
Sparrow Passer domesticus in a nearby cherry tree started calling ; the
euphonia answered with a powerful melodious song. So excited did the
bird become that it sang with bill opened wide, at the same time raising
the feathers of the crown, throat and lower breast. I have observed a

male Golden-sided Euphonia Euphonia cayennensis using the same
singing posture when placed near to a male Chestnut-bellied Euphonia
Euphonia pectoralis which was uttering its rasping, insect-like calls.
True pairs of the White-vented Euphonia Euphonia minuta have
been imported from Ecuador. Another small euphonia which is also
very rare in aviculture, namely Finsch's Euphonia Euphonia finschi
has been imported in small numbers from Surinam. This species is
closely related to the Velvet-fronted Euphonia Euphonia concinna,
having been classed as a subspecies at one time.
A few males of the Golden-sided Euphonia Euphonia cayennensis
were imported from Surinam. This euphonia is also called the Black
Euphonia, after the French " le tangara noir de Gayenne 55 and the old
scientific name Tanagra nigra. The extraordinary all steel-blue colour
pattern with orange-yellow patches on the sides of the breast, makes it
a very attractive bird. This species, together with the Rufous-bellied
and the Chestnut-bellied Euphonias, respectively Euphonia rufiventris
and pectoralis, form a superspecies. The latter was imported in 1973
(Ingels 1974).
Although euphonias have always been imported in reasonable
numbers, established pairs are rarely seen in confinement and in spite
of the obvious sexual difference, breeding results have been somewhat
rare (Ingels 1975).
The Blue-breasted Tanager T an gar a cyanoventris, also called the
Gilt-edged Tanager, has an extremely pleasing colour pattern. This
Brazilian tanager with its very limited distribution range (from Bahia
to Sao Paulo, Brazil) is closely related to the Brassy-breasted Tanager
Tangara desmaresti, occurring also in south-eastern Brazil. In fact a
wild-caught hybrid between both species has been described by Sclater
as Gould's Tanager Tangara gouldi (Ingels 1971).
The distribution of the Brazilian subspecies of the Turquoise Tan-
ager Tangara mexicana brasiliensis also called the Brazilian Blue
Tanager after the French " le tangara bleu du Bresil ", is restricted to
the wooded coastal region above Rio de Janeiro. At one time it was
considered a distinct species and given the name White-bellied Tanager
Tangara brasiliensis. It differs mainly from the northern subspecies in
being larger (15 instead of 13.5 cm), having no turquoise on wing-
coverts and white instead of yellow undeiparts.
The Grey and Gold or Palmer's Tanager Tangara palmeri which is
approximately 16 cm long, is one of the larger Tangara species. It was
first described by Hellmayr in 1909, and because of this is sometimes
referred to as Hellmayr's Silvery Tanager. Silvery is indeed the overall
impression of this tanager's unusual colour pattern, and despite its
somewhat sombre coloration, close examination reveals the species to
be most attractive. Little is known regarding the species, and the 12
specimens imported last year may have been the first available to
;

aviculture.
A few pairs of Chestnut-backed Tanagers Tangara preciosa, the
largest Tangara species (16.5 cm), have been imported recently. In
1973, only females were available. This species shows an obvious sexual
difference. The Arnault's Tanager Tangara arnaulti described by
Berlioz in 1927 is most probably a hybrid between this species and the
southern form of the Burnished-buff Tanager Tangara cay ana
chloropUra.
The Black-chinned Mountain-tanager Anisognathus notabilis is
closely related to the better known Blue-winged Mountain-tanager
Anisognathus flavimichus, but the former is more attractively coloured.
Previously, both tanagers formed the genus Compsocoma and were
only recently placed by de Schauensee (1964) in the genus Anisogna -
thus, although both genera differ greatly in habits and general
behaviour.
This year only one Hooded Mountain-tanager Buthraupis montana,
which is protected, reached Europe, as did one specimen of the related
but rare Black-chested Mountain-tanager Buthraupis eximia. It is
obvious from their general behaviour that both of these sturdily built
species (21.5 cm) belong to the same genus.
Nowadays mountain-tanagers including the above mentioned species,
are badly threatened by environmental changes of their Andean sub-
tropical and temperate life zones, especially in Colombia and Ecuador.
Lately the forests of these higher altitudes have been cleared to make
way for plantations and grazing lands. With the destruction of their
habitat, these tanagers must move on to another forest zone where
they may find it difficult adapting to their new habitat, thus resulting
in decimation through predation and interruption of reproduction.
There are a few tanager species which adapt successfully to the new
environment of cultivated areas, such as Tachyphanus and Ramp ho-
celus species (Buechner et al., 1970; Paez, 1973).
Males and females of the two main subspecies bonariensis and
schulzei of the Blue and Yellow Tanager Thraupis bonariensis were
among consignments of Brazilian tanagers and Argentinian cardinaline
finches respectively. Females of this Thraupis are rarely imported, and
I have not seen them alive before. Immature birds are olive coloured
with greyish-white underparts, and therefore cannot be confused with
the greyish-brown adult females. Moreover, young males often show
some bluish or orange feathers on the head and breast respectively.
The main differences between both subspecies mentioned are overall
length and form of the bill. Thraupis bonariensis schulzei (15 cm) is
distinctly smaller than Thraupis bonariensis bonariensis (17.5 cm). It
is also said the former has a more orange abdomen, but the (age
depending?) differences in colour deepness of this body part between
individuals within a given subspecies are too important as to allow such

a conclusion. The differences in bill, especially in its height, are even
more important; schulzei and bonariensis: exposed culmen : 12 and
12.5 mm (from base: 15 and 15.5 mm), height: 6.75 and 9 mm,
respectively. The former's bill is more slender, the latter's thicker,
blunter and broader at the base (see Fig. 1). Schulzei and bonariensis
have a blackish upper mandible; however, the former's lower mandible
is horn colour, whereas the latter's is whitish.

The nominate subspecies has been bred in the aviaries of the late

Pairs of the Crimson-backed Tanager Ramphocelus dimidiatus were
imported from Colombia. This species is closely related to the Silver-
beaked Ramphocelus carbo and Black-bellied Tanagers Ramphocelus
melanogaster } and these three are thought to form a superspecies with
the Brazilian Scarlet Tanager Ramphocelus bresilius. However, the
lighter coloured rump and underparts, in marked contrast with the
darker coloured head and mantle, are typical of dimidiatus only. The
Crimson-backed Tanager was bred in 1967 by H. Murray (England).
Two pairs of Hepatic Tanagers Piranga flava were found in Brazilian
imports. The dark coloured bill and cheeks and greater length (17.5

cm) distinguish the male from the Summer Tanager Piranga rubra;
(16 cm). The female Hepatic can be separated from the female Summet
Tanager by its dark coloured bill and cheek patches and also by the
more greenish-yellow appearance which is tinged with orange on the
underparts.
Hepatic Tanagers migrate from the northern parts of their distribu-
tion range (U.S. A., Mexico); the subspecies of subtropical and tropical
parts are resident. Therefore it seems to be an intermediate form
between the migrating North American Piranga species and the more
sedentary species of that genus in the tropics.
The mainly south Brazilian Ruby-crowned, or Red-crowned Tanager
Tac hyp bonus coronatus is very closely related to the slightly larger
White-lined or Black Tanager Tachyphonus rufus. Confusion between
both species is possible, as the red crown patch is clearly visible only
when a male is held in the hand. Occasionally one may obtain a
glimpse of the red when a specimen becomes excited and erects its
crown feathers.
A very unusual and rarely imported tanager is the Grass-green
Tanager Chlorornis riefferii. Other than the already mentioned Green
and Yellow Chlorophonia, this species is the only tanager with a strik-
ing red bill, legs and feet. The Grass-green Tanager has yet to be
studied and little is known regarding its habits other than the informa-
tion supplied by Dunning in his Portraits of Tropical Birds (1970).
After a moult in confinement, the brilliant grass-green colour becomes a
beautiful blue (Scamell 1966).
The Cinnamon Tanager Schistochlamys ruficapillus is only found in
Brazil, unlike the other species of that genus, the Black-faced Tanager
Schistochlamys melanopis which is distributed throughout the whole
eastern South America and which was imported last year (Ingels 1974).
These tanager species are closely related to the saltators, cardinals
and certain grosbeaks. Their general appearance, especially the bull-
finch-like bill, and the colour pattern resembles that of certain gros-
beaks ( e.g . Caryothraustes species), and it is said their song resembles
that of a saltator rather than a tanager (Mitchell 1957).

While the convergent adaptations of flowers and the many species of [
tropical and sub-tropical birds that take nectar and pollen from them
are quite well known, there is a lack of detailed information on the :
insect part of the diet of almost all the nectar-feeding birds. Those who ;\0x25A0
keep such birds in captivity are faced with the problem of how 7 to
provide animal protein in a suitable form and, of course, it is mostly :
done by additives to the liquid food, for such as hummingbirds and
sunbirds refuse to take solid foods from dishes. Even the proven method 1
of teaching difficult species of insectivorous birds such as the Goldcrest
to eat artificial foods by sticking ant pupae and morsels of soft food
on to twigs and leaves by means of fat or water will fail in the case of
hummingbirds, sunbirds and others who are only attracted to live
insects, particularly those that are moving. Such birds kept indoors
can, of course, be given such easily bred insects as fruit flies (. Droso - i
phila), wax moths, houseflies, etc., but to supply a sufficiency in quan- |
tity and variety might be difficult. On the principle that necessity is i
the mother of invention, many aviculturists, myself among them, have
tried giving these birds meat extract, ground up Daphnia, bone, meat
and fish meals, horse liver, beef fat, dried cod-liver oil, algal meal and
much else besides. Many animals are successfully kept on substitute

foods, so why not nectar-feeding birds? There have been notable suc-
cesses with some of them, but for the most part such successes have
been with hardy and adaptable species and they are the more astonish-
ing in view of the very specialised alimentary tract of nectar-eating
birds. Nectar and insects are first mixed with saliva in the crop and
probably predigested while the nectar, which in natural form consists
of simple sugars, can be quickly absorbed by the gut, passing rapidly
to the intestines while the insects are first digested in the stomach. As
with many birds, indigestible chitinous parts of insects are regurgitated
in the form of pellets. Of the digestive secretions and processes in the
crop, stomach and intestines of nectar-eating birds little is known
beyond what is general knowledge of the digestive systems of other
vertebrates.
Carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins and all such ingredients of
the artificial nectar, because of the structure of the alimentary tract,
pass straight to the intestines so that the protein in the mixture is not
acted on first by pepsin, but immediately by trypsin and therefore it is
not known whether this protein is properly digested and utilised, but
there is doubt on this point.
The great difficulty of keeping montane hummingbirds and sunbirds
which, in nature, feed more on insects than on nectar and pollen is
further evidence of this doubt, for all the successfully kept species have
been lower altitude forms that in the wild state take a greater propor-
tion of nectar. The best method of keeping these birds is to ensure that
they have ample supplies and a variety of live food, and since the
breeding of large quantities of fruit flies, etc., is a lot of work, we have
our nectar-feeding birds in an aviary that combines an inner shelter
with an outdoor flight. The birds can get from the planted and heated
shelter measuring 14 x 4 x 3.5 m. via an open window to the planted
outdoor flight which measures 22 x 2.5 x 3 m. where many insects are
attracted to the food vessels, while in other parts of the aviary we put
receptacles of decaying fish, meat and fruit to attract more insects. In
the evening the artificial lighting of the shelter attracts still more insects
and the birds are thereby encouraged to come for the night into the
warmed shelter. During the day almost all the aviary inmates spend
their time in the outside flight. Now, after ij years we can see the
advantages of such accommodation over the more usual type of indoor
aviary and the importance of such natural factors as sun, fresh air,
temperature variations and rain. The following instances support this
claim : Bronzy Sunbirds Nectarinia kilim&amp;nsis of which we had kept
indoors two males and a female for almost a year began to sing within
a month of being put into the aviary, whereas previously we had heard
nothing from them but an occasional call note. Newly imported
Tacazze N. tacazze and Malachite Sunbirds N. famosa were put into
the aviary immediately on arrival and were acclimatised without loss

and the males were singing after only a matter of days. We had similar
results with two pairs of Splendid Sunbirds Cinnyris coccinigaster, a
pair of Hunter's Sunbirds Chalcomitra hunteri and a Blue-headed
Cyanomitra alinae . Of a large number of Scarlet-backed Flower-
peckers Dicaeum cruentatum half were put into the aviary on arrival
and were acclimatised without loss whereas the remainder, put into
our indoor quarantine cages, suffered some losses. Hummingbirds of
various species, Masked Flower-piercers Diglossa cyanea, Blue Floney-
creepers Cyanerpes cyanea, the Blue Dacnis Dacnis cayana and
Bananaquits Coereba flaueola are also thriving in this aviary. The
Bananaquits have built two large globular nests and a female Splendid
Sunbird built a half-metre long hanging nest of cobwebs, plant fibres
and wool and laid one egg which, after an incubation of 14 days,
hatched, but the chick did not live.
Signs that the birds are getting a sufficiency of insect life in the
aviary include the fact that at the midday siesta period they are more
interested in resting than in catching insects, whereas those kept indoors
are at all times eager for the live food. I have observed that the animal
protein seemingly preferred by the birds in their artificial nectar is raw
egg and mealworms suitably minced and thoroughly mixed with the
other ingredients, of course, and this seems to suit them better than
other protein preparations.
There are, of course, many recipes for the liquid nectar food, but
our method of supplying insect life appears not only better, but cer-
tainly far cheaper than the cultures would be; also the birds are given
exercise in pursuit of the flying insects attracted to the aviary. We are,
of course, fortunate to enjoy a mild climate---Heidelberg is, not with-
out reason, called the " most northerly town of Italy "--and to be
situated in an area of many orchards and a countryside favourable to
a wide variety of insect life.

The Azure-Winged Magpie
Cyanopica cyanus
Some years ago, when John Yealland was curator of birds at the
London Zoo, he and I were discussing various species in the collection
as we strolled along the aviaries. All of a sudden my eye was taken by
a beautiful bird that I had not seen before, and he was able to tell me
much about it. It was a fine example of an eastern race of the Azure-
winged Magpie Cyanopica cyanus. As this beautiful bird presented
itself to us, the story of its extraordinary distribution unrolled and the
species acquired a special appeal for me that it has never since lost. A
few years later I accepted a transfer to my company's Madrid office
and suddenly the dream of studying the species in the field became a
real possibility, for Cyanopica cyanus occurs in the Iberian peninsula
(and the most easterly parts of Asia--and nowhere in between).
In the almost five years that I spent in Spain I had many oppor-
tunities to watch the bird in the field and was able to keep specimens
in my bird room on several occasions. The bulk of the following notes
are taken more or less literally from my bird diary for 1972, but before
referring to these I would like to suggest that any member sufficiently
interested in the species may find my notes (Restall 1972) and those by
Derek Goodwin (1971) of interest. These notes contain various data on
feeding, breeding and natural behaviour in the wild. Even so, that is
not very helpful if one does not have the books to hand, so I will
briefly summarise the feeding and breeding behaviour.
Azure-winged Magpies are obviously omnivorous, but have strong
insectivorous tendencies. Those that I have managed to watch undis-
turbed have appeared to be taking beetles, grasshoppers and other
small items that might have been seeds. They apparently take fruit in
season (Coveriy 1933) and seeds including acorns (Goodwin 1971).
Sydney Porter collected some of the Chinese birds before the war and
brought them back to England where he successfully bred from several
pairs. He found that in addition to the usual diet given to birds of this
kind, they took mice (Porter 1941).
Philip Wayre, who has regularly bred the species since acquiring six
in 1966, normally feeds his birds on a mixture of pheasant starter
crumbs and insectile food, with a liberal supply of mealworms and
maggots. When rearing young they appeared to feed them exclusively
on mealworms which were sprinkled daily with Glaxo's Casilan to
supply additional protein.
While In Spain the species appears to be persecuted by the man
with the gun (which means about half the male population at the

weekend), in Portugal it is persecuted by farmers for its believed eating
habits. It is destroyed " because of the damage it does to potato crops
Yet when 60 specimens were shot for crop analysis they were found to
have been feeding exclusively on the Colorado Beetle (Santos 1965).
Also in Portugal the eggs and young are often destroyed whenever they
are found because they are said to do such great damage to fruit trees
(Coverly 1933). I have clear evidence from observations in garden
areas along the southern side of the Credos mountains that they take 1
a lot of fruit in season, in this case figs and cherries.
On one memorable occasion my wife and I watched about a dozen
of these birds cleaning up the remains of a Spanish roadside picnic. A
pile of apple peel, cores and orange bits had been dumped on the ,
verge, and the magpies were tucking in like a gang of Blouse Sparrows.
Large morsels would be carried to a tree, held with a foot and dealt |
with. They would gulp down lumps of apple the size of grapes, but
totally ignored the orange. The flock scattered at the approach of every '
car, but our car--quietly sitting still--was ignored. We were almost i
too close for binoculars and my camera was at home! On two occa-
sions we have seen identical behaviour in the car park of the mountain
cathedral at the Valle de los Gaidos.
The nest is a reasonably well-constructed cup of bents and twigs,
lined with grass and soft hair, etc. It is frequently found in almond
trees, olives, or evergreen oaks, fairly close to the trunk as a rule and
from 10 to 20 feet from the ground--according to the literature. All
the nests that I have found have been between 20 and 30 feet up, and
nesting normally occurs in May and June. They are occasionally
double-brooded, I believe, but I think that this is either a response to
unsuccessful first rounds (personal observations) or an early start under
particularly favourable conditions having ideal breeding conditions
still prevailing (aviculture).
Two of Porter's pairs built a double nest, one joined to and below
the other. As the young reached fledging time four of them (there were
eight) transferred to the lower nest. The clutch, incidentally, may be
anything from four to nine (I have only found five or six).
My office diary for 1972 was made redundant by the gift of one of
those status-symbol ones from a prestigious British journal. It immedi-
ately became a kind of bird diary, and the following notes are, literally,
what I wrote at the time.
"6th February, 1972. The third bad weekend on the trot, pouring with rain.
The Rastro (Sunday morning market) is dead and while there is the normal
brisk trade in canaries - I've never seen so many people walking off with
breeding cages - there is nothing to even look at, except a few Goldfinches.
This morning I finished an article for John Gooders on the Azure-winged Mag-
pie, including a story on how I had been quoted a price in a pet shop of #48
each for the species. I decided to inflict the family with a wait in the car while
I stopped off at the market for some bird seed on our Way to Church. To my
shock and surprise I saw a trapper with five tatty and sorrowful Azure-winged

Magpies. I was tremendously interested (and excited) but tried not to show it.
'Naturally, they're very expensive', said the dealer. I didn't ask the price, but
he gave me a long hard sell on how four of them were young, vigorously healthy,
and had been in his possession for a long time (a lie, since he certainly didn't
have them last week). The fifth bird was sick, and had spasmodic convulsions.
This, it was claimed, was recently caught and had not yet responded to his
care. So i asked the price and was quoted 1,500 pesetas for the four good
ones (#9). Not certain whether this figure was for one or all I feigned disap-
pointment and did my Japanese 'SaaaV impression, meant to convey gravity,
concern, unhappiness - and folly imputed to the other party. The Japanese are
very clever. I was then clearly offered all five for this price, and trying not to
shake or stutter with excitement I agreed and arranged for them to be deli-
vered to my house after lunch.
Before going out that morning I had tucked an old (and empty) pepper pot
half-filled with mealworms into my pocket. Just before leaving the dealer I
gave these to the birds, attempting to give most of them to the sick bird. 'That's
not necessary', said the man's wife, 'they're used to eating bread.' Sure enough
the sick one did peck at some bread - but in despair I thought - and it quickly
seized the mealworms.
When the birds arrived that afternoon I had already prepared two roomy
cages for them plus water dosed with aureomycin, a dozen or so mealworms for
each bird, and a bowl of soft food sprinkled with chopped-up mealworms. Food
formula:
Large cup of Sluis universal
Lump of corned beef
Hard-boiled egg
Teaspoon of peanut butter
Dessert spoon of runny honey
Lump of cheese
The solids were grated fairly finely on a Mouli-grater.
The Robin was given some of this food and loved it.
That evening the light was kept on until 9.00 p.m. One of the birds called
a great deal and I attempted to listen carefully. The call is rather similar to
that of the Spreo Starling, but when repeated very rapidly, ooreagh, ooreagh,
it sounds like a double note.
All five are remarkably tame and steady - rather the way that half-starved
birds often are. Those in the 3 cage are slim, upright and active. In 2 cage the
sickly bird (Fig. 1) is puffed up, but ate a lot of mealworms. Its companion
was sufficiently relaxed to enable me to make a lot of sketches while all it did
was watch me. Those in 3 keep shaking themselves as if attempting to bathe.

so I think that I may wash them soon (they are filthy). One has a badly broken
tail, and will henceforth be called Shorty. It is fascinating to watch the change
of personality that occurs when the thin sleek head is fluffed out to become a
guardsman's busby. This is done when the bird is excited in some way. The
black head, bill and eye, are indistinguishable and it is not easy to see where
one begins and the next ends, for the irides are very dark in colour.
7 February. This morning filled both food bowls with repeat of mixture,
being short of mealworms only gave 12 to the 3 cage but 20 in the 2 cage. This
evening both food bowls completely cleaned out. Sickly looks better but is still
much more fluffed up than its companion. It roosts well fluffed out and with both
feet gripping the perch. Tried them with an orange this evening. Cut into
small bits but kept within the skin. 3 cage sampled it but didn't exactly gobble
it up. No response from 2 cage. Mixed fresh batch of food but replaced corned
beef with raw minced beef.
26 March. There are at least three different voice groupings apart from the
social contact yodel mentioned earlier. A loud clear screech, sheer and often long
and sustained; this is given by a bird alone but not under any apparent stress
or pressure (other than of being isolated). Then there is a soft, very low intensity
screech made by the pursued bird when being chased or bullied by the dominant
member of the group. Next, a soft, short, clicking note made by a bird busy
searching for food. I have a distinct feeling that this is a mate-contact call
rather than flock-contact.
My wife heard the pursued-squeak several times and was convinced that, by
the increased intensity of bumps and sometimes climaxing in a crash and
squawk that some kind of a fight was occurring regularly. As I never found a
single feather, nor a damaged bird, I concluded that it was not too serious.
All four of the birds are now in a new cage measuring seven feet by four by four.
It has three perches and gives the birds some freedom of movement. I have
noticed that when the birds are nicely at rest (Fig. 2) at mid-day for example,
or when roosting for the night they are always grouped one-two-one, which
leads me to the tempting conclusion that there is one bonded pair at least
while the other two might be anything.
28th March. This morning at dawn I heard the pursued squeak and raced
upstairs to peek around the corner. On two occasions I managed to hear and
see the chase and positively identified the aggressor as pendulum-tail. This
bird was chasing in a determined sort of way (but not so determined as to be
really vicious). As the fleer fled it squeaked the 'help !' note continuously."

Obviously one cannot keep such large and active birds in cages for
long. The sickly bird had deteriorated rapidly and had a nasty head-
twisting convulsion : it soon died. I had isolated it and given a lot of
mealworms, well dosed with medicine, but to no avail. I was unwilling
to release the four healthy adults since I hoped to be able to study them
in aviary conditions in due course. Eventually I managed to get them
back to England where they were split into two pairs and left in the
care of friends. I hope that their notes on the breeding behaviour of
the birds, plus feeding, etc., will follow these notes.
Later the same year I happened to be in the market on a Sunday
morning. The following entry is headed, Immature bought 20.8.72 :
"A man that I have never seen before on any of my visits to the market was
standing in mid-stream, the dense crowd surging by and around him. A cry of
'Oh! Rabilargo! ' caught my attention and within seconds I was by his side.
He was holding a small and battered canary cage, within which was dull and
shabby Azure-winged Magpie. 'How much?' I asked. 'Two hundred, with
cage', was the reply. Without further ado I thrust a couple of notes into his
hand and dashed off home gleefully. It wasn't until I opened the boot of the
car when I arrived home that I realised that the dullness was from immaturity
and not dirt. The bird greeted me with some high-intensity begging. I put it
in a large (but not large enough) all-wire double-breeder where I could keep a
constant watch on it. The cage could be kept on a tree by the front door, and
in the living area of the house.
Plumage: Black head flecked with broad arrowheads (Fig. 3a) of light
brown. These edges look as though they will wear off, leaving the head blacker,
before being replaced by a moult. These pale marks form a distinct superciliary
line and are scattered all over the crown and ear coverts. Otherwise plumage is
as per adult bird, but noticeably duller. Mantle and scapulars are greyer than
on an adult but do have a brown wash.
It seems as though the canary cage had been the house of the bird for it
seemed to be well 'fitted in', and its tail was frayed and worn by constant
rubbing against the wires. However, I decided that it had been given a lot of
freedom also for it was very keen to explore and see all the corners of its new
world.
Voice: Rasping 'open mouthed' noise, which sounds like displeasure (being
anthropomorphic) is almost identical to adult. Two similar contact cries are
unmistakably Azure-winged Magpie in origin, but are not the familiar adult

contact calls. Possibly the exact/accurate notes are learned, the calls of this
bird being 'inherited memory'.
Begging: Solicits food exactly like any other baby crow, raised beak open,
depressed body, fluttery wings, baby squeaking/pleading. Intensity of solicitation
is a response to feeding stimuli (in this case my fingers with food) and not hun-
ger. When genuinely hungry will beg high intensity just at the very sight of
me. Will spend ages hiding morsels, retrieving them, hiding them again, etc.,
a real game of hide-and-seek. Often it will beg a morsel from me only to go off
and hide it. Young Magpies and Carrion Crows have done exactly the same.
Food: After an hour of food hide and seek I gave some soft sweet apple. This
was all devoured with obvious enjoyment -- then back to food hide-and-seek.
Diet has been a mixture of scraps of raw chicken neck, chopped chicken crop,
hard-boiled egg, raisins, apple, grated cheese, all tossed in Sluis universal. On
occasion ripe tomatoes and sweet grapes have been devoured ravenously.
Behaviour. In general an absolutely enchanting pet, full of the antics that
one might expect from a magpie or crow. When a finger is pointed at it it J
immediately stands stiff (Fig. 3b) and stretches its neck with every feather j
erect. This is a super-high-intensity allo-preening invitation response. The head j
is not tilted. Pupils are dilated. When the bird is released in the house it proves
to be totally tame. Its favourite resting spot is on somebody's head. When
perched on wrist or finger it almost invariably responds to any attention by its
stretched-out peering act (Fig. 4). This can be triggered off by close talking,
hand moving near by, nearness of a child's head. When alone it calls frequently,
a drawn-out rasping wha-a-a-a-a, but shuts up at once and behaves very content-
edly and happily whenever it has human company. Body postures go from one
extreme of being tightly sleeked and alert to roundediy fluffed-up and relaxed.
Its most incredible ability is knowing when anyone is intent on giving it a titbit;
It begins begging at once, with increasingly high intensity as the treat draws

I took this bird over to England on a subsequent business trip, and
left it in the care of my friend Colin Harrison. Early reports on its
progress confirmed that it was totally human-imprinted, was miserable
in the aviary with the other Azure-winged Magpies and was only
happy when perching on its keeper's head. Whether Colin has been
able to do any comparative studies on this bird and the wild-caught
adults I do not know. An interesting remark of his that is worth
repeating here is that birds of this kind are much more likely to be
totally imprinted when reared in isolation as individuals, but the
damage is significantly reduced when two or more are reared together.
However, I learned from Miss Laura Fisher, who was a student of
Dr. Castroviejo (of the Gonsejo Superior de Investigaciones Cienti-
ficas), that with him she had helped to hand-rear various birds and
mammals. On one occasion they hand-reared a brood of four Azure-
winged Magpies. One died, one was given away, but the other two
were thought to be fairly thoroughly imprinted onto humans. On two
separate occasions broods of two Carrion Crows were hand-reared and
both times both birds were undoubtedly imprinted. Unfortunately no
tests in aviary or at liberty were conducted to see whether these birds
would breed.

The first breeding in this country of the Purple Grenadier Waxbill
Granatin a ianthinogaster took place in 1958 at the Keston Foreign Bird
Farm (A.M. vol. 64, pp. 164-166) and what is probably the second
success was achieved by Mr. and Mrs. N. R. Flint at their home in
Oxfordshire. The birds were kept for the winter in a cage 6 ft. x 15 in.
x 15 in. in a birdroom heated to 6o* F. and in May they were put into
a greenhouse together with a pair of Heck's Grassfinches and a pair of
Green Avadavats. In June a nest composed of grass and dead bamboo
leaves was constructed : it was built in a bush and was domed with a
side entrance. The incubation was shared by the pair, each sitting for
about six hours at a time during the hours of daylight. At hatching
time the male drove the other birds away from the area of the nest
and in July two young birds of a soft brown colour came out.
The birds were given panicum millet, soaked and germinated spray
millet, seeding grasses, an insectile mixture, mealworms, fruit flies and,
as soon as nesting started, freshly collected ant cocoons and grasshop-
pers. A vitamin and mineral supplement was also given and when the
eggs hatched both green and black aphids were added to the diet. The
young continued to be fed by the father for some six weeks after leaving
the nest and meanwhile the mother had laid two more eggs in the same
nest, the resulting two young being also reared. The winter is a par-
ticularly difficult time in the keeping of this species and Mr. and Mrs.
Flint believe that a dry atmosphere during this time of the year is
necessary for the health of this waxbill.

Birds Introduced into East Africa
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998104591836735" page_id="56381426"  page_num="115" year="" vol="">
The letter from J. C. Barlass about some of the birds seen during a visit to
East Africa was most interesting, particularly the comments about the lovebirds
on the Kenya coast at Nyali Beach, Mombasa.
Fischer's Lovebird Agapornis fischeri has never been recorded in the wild in
Kenya, and the Masked or Yellow-collared A. personata only once as a
straggler many years ago. As the heading to the letter suggests, these species
have been introduced and this has happened fairly recently, not only at the
coast but elsewhere in Kenya. On one occasion, a few years ago, I saw some
lovebirds fly over Lake Naivasha, but was unable to identify them.
In a letter to the east Africa natural history society bulletin, August
1972, A. D. Forbes-Watson wrote that both were common in Nairobi and around
Lake Naivasha, adding that they hybridize freely and that most are inter-
mediates at one stage or another. He noted that they only appear to be success-
ful in their new localities when associated with man.
Following the letter two observers wrote saying that Forbes-Watson had
omitted any mention of these birds on the Kenya coast, at the same time stating
that there did not appear to be any published accounts of Agapornis for this
locality. They then list their own records for 1972; the biggest party they
encountered numbered only around 20 Masked Lovebirds---nothing to compare
with the " literally hundreds of Fischer's Lovebirds " that Mr. Barlass saw.
They noted a bird that looked basically like personata , but with the lower
throat to chest yellowish-orange. This was thought at first to be a hybrid, but
later found to fit the description of a known variation in which orange may be
present on the upper breast and even on the yellow back of the neck.
Fischer's and the Masked Lovebird both occur naturally in Tanzania, which
is immediately to the south of Kenya. Although there appear to be no major
physical barriers to prevent them spreading north, almost certainly they are all
released cage birds or escapes. Lots of these lovebirds are exported from Tan-
zania, some by air from Nairobi and others doubtless by sea on vessels that call
at Mombasa, so these localities would be likely places where mass escapes could
occur.
A third species, the Red-headed Lovebird A. pullaria extends naturally east-
wards from Uganda into extreme western Kenya where it is said to be scarce
and restricted.
The Madagascar Lovebird A. cana was once introduced onto the East African
islands of Zanzibar and Mafia from the Comoros (where it still occurs as a
naturalised species) but failed to establish itself permanently.
A letter in the November 1971 issue of the e.a.n.h.s. bulletin records
the sighting of four Ring-necked Parrakeets Psittacula krameri in Nairobi
National Park earlier that year. The authors state that " In features the birds
appeared identical to the Indian Ring-necked Parrakeet P.k. borealis which is so
popular as a cage and aviary bird".
They point out that van Someren first drew attention to the presence of this
species in the National Park in 1969. In this instance, I think, van Someren saw
a pair at a nest. He concluded they were " most likely to be escapes, or the
progeny of escapes, of imported birds" rather than an African race.
The African Ring-necked Parrakeet occurs naturally in Uganda, but not
Kenya or Tanzania. An Asiatic race has been introduced onto Zanzibar where
it is said to be rare.

Aviculture&apos;s Impact on some Rare Australian Parrots
Members of the Society may be surprised and pained to know what a bad
name British and European aviculture " enjoys " among Australian ornitholo-
gists. It is a sad and unfortunate fact that aviculture has been responsible for
severely depleting the numbers of two of Australia's most beautiful parrots, the
Hooded and Golden-shouldered Parrakeets. The word has got around that in
Britain and Europe aviculturists are prepared to pay very high prices for these
birds. The supposed prices may well be exaggerated, but the effect on the two
species is catastrophic.
They are totally protected and have no natural enemies except man, but they 1
are conspicuous birds and nest in termite mounds. Once the nesting hole has
been established it is a simple matter to plug the hole at night and to dig out
the birds. How many caught in this way survive the shock of being handled by ;
aviculturally unskilled station hands and boundary riders is hard to say-- !
probably not very many. Those exported are smuggled out in the most brutal
manner. A recent case where two smugglers were caught trying to take out
Golden-shouldered and Brown's Parrakeets is recounted in the following news-
paper account of 25th January, 1975: --

shouldered parrots from Cape York, would sell for more than $6,000 a pair
overseas.
" A customs officer said, outside the court, they were in danger of extinction.

constructed tape recorder and four in specially-constructed bags hanging below
his knees, under his trousers.

the aircraft's hold.
" Reuss told Mr. Smyth through an interpreter that heat had killed the birds.
" He was a bird lover and if he had been aware of the heat danger he would
have packed them differently.
" Mr. Smyth said Reuss had not given much thought to the birds--* only to
the profit that was coming his way.'
" Mr. Ryan said the defendants told Customs officers all the arrangements
had been made overseas by another person who was known to the Fauna Squad.
He said inquiries were being made about this person.
" Reuss said his reward was to be the two blue bonnet parrots.
"Frei said he was not quite aware of the seriousness of the offence."
I realise that not many members of the Society own illegally obtained Austra-
lian parrots and the number who own Hooded or Golden-shouldered Parrakeets
must be minute. Nevertheless members should be aware of the harm that is done

Subspecies and their relevance to aviculture
, I have followed with interest the views expressed by Dr. Colin Harrison
(A.M. 76, 1970, pp. 191-194) and David Holyoak (A.M. 81, 1975, p. 59) regard-
j ing the desirability and practicability of aviculturists concerning themselves with
the subspecific division of species. I wonder if I might be permitted to put for-
! ward my own views on this somewhat complex subject? I should point out that
my views are not backed by the erudition possessed by the two authors
 |mentioned above, but are those of a " dilettante " employing what I hope to be
simple logic. I realise that some of my reasoning may be scientifically unsound,
in which case no doubt some of our members will correct my erroneous thinking.
To perhaps over simplify my contention; it is my view that if a local popula-
tion of a species merits being awarded subspecific status then this division is
relevant to aviculture. If however, the subspecific status is aviculturally irrele-
vant, then that status is unwarranted anyway. Perhaps I can now expand these
points.
I am obviously at variance with accepted systematics, but I can see no
purpose in awarding subspecific status to a population of a species if it is
impossible or nearly impossible to visually identify examples correctly. I would
have thought that for subspecific division to be of any value, examples of that
subspecies should possess consistent and definable characteristics that set them
apart from the nominate and any other forms. I can see no benefit in gratuit-
ously bestowing subspecific status on a regional population of a species merely
because their range has crossed a geographical border, which on many occasions
is political anyway and has nothing to do with zoogeography.
If part of the population of a species becomes geographically isolated and
so evolves independently, then it is probable that after a period of time this
isolated group will assume characteristics that make it visually identifiable.
Also, of course, if two populations of a species are widely separated such as in
the case of the Azure-winged Magpie Cyanopica cyanus, then it is feasible that
examples from the two groups will develop distinct characteristics which would
make subspecific division a viable decision. However, many species with
extensive ranges are divided into numerous subspecies all occupying contiguous
areas. Surely in such an instance, although specimens from opposite ends of the
range might be significantly different, a spectrum of variation will exist, making
subspecific division impracticable--and unworkable?
I have a particular interest in two families; the Strigidae and the Psittacidae
and both abound in examples of species capriciously divided into myriads of
allopatric subspecies which to my view are unjustified and impracticable. For
example, in the standard work on North American birds (Bent), nine subspecies
of Great Horned Owl Bubo virginianus are described, all with contiguous ranges.
How is it possible to define at what point a population ceases to belong to one
subspecies, but should be classed as another? In fact, this problem is compli-
cated still further when one realises that even local populations of Bubo
virginianus can vary quite significantly and, in addition, depending upon
weather and the availability of food, considerable seasonal movements of popu-
lation can take place, which would result in populations becoming intermingled.
Therefore, with the intergrading and sporadic movements of population that
take place, I find it difficult to accept that such munificent division is either
desirable or warranted. When one further considers that Bent and his workers
largely confined their interests to the avifauna of the U.S.A. and that Bubo
virginianus is indigenous to almost the entire continents of North and South

America, it makes one wonder how many subspecies would have resulted if the
species as a whole had been investigated!
If I had to select a similar example of what I consider to be excessive division
from the Psittacidae, I think that I would find it difficult to suggest a more
obvious case than the Rainbow Lorikeet Trichoglossus haematod (of Peters)
which has been discussed in some detail by Rosemary Low (A.M. 80, 1974, pp.
203-204) and David Holyoak.
In common with some species of owl, many species of lorikeet seem to exhibit
almost infinite variation, in fact so much so, that if a shipment of a few dozen
birds is examined, it is not unusual to find that there are hardly two birds of
identical size, coloration and markings and this is particularly true of Tricho-
glossus haematod. Confronted with such a variable species it would seem
imprudent to accept slight differences as evidence of subspecific deviation and
yet this is exactly what has occurred. I, like Dr. Harrison and Mr. Holyoak,
have examined museum skins and even after a detailed comparison of the skins
of some subspecies, I have been unable to find any discernible difference.
Presumably identification was made possible only because the origin was known
---surely this is absurd?
I think that it is now generally accepted that the present nomenclature
applied to the Rainbow Lorikeets is totally unworkable, but it is equally true
that any alternative is far from perfect. Having spent some time studying this
enigmatic species both as living aviary birds and as museum skins, may I suggest
a revised system that I consider more appropriate and workable? It is my
opinion that this species can be split into three groups which would be better
considered as distinct species and that many of the subspecies should be amalga-
mated. The groups are as follows: --

To conclude, it is my belief, that if a population of a species merits sub-
specific status then it must be significantly and consistently distinct and if this
is the case, then it is incumbent upon aviculturists to retain the subspecies in
their pure form.

I wish to relate the following which took place during 1974 between two
breeders of parrakeets: I find it hard to believe, but nevertheless it is apparently
true. One of the persons concerned had a clutch of eggs laid by a Yellow-bellied
Parrakeet Platycercus flaviventris and unfortunately the female refused to
incubate them. His supposed friend had a pair of Pennant's Parrakeets P.
splendens with a clutch of eggs and incubation just commenced, so it was
agreed that two of the aforementioned eggs should be put with the clutch of
Pennant's. The two eggs hatched and the youngsters were reared along with the
six Pennant's that hatched and when the young were independent, the owner
of the Yellow-bellied was so delighted that in appreciation he offered his
"friend " a young hen Pennant's that he had himself bred. This generous gesture
was turned down as the rearer of the birds did not think it sufficient reward and
demanded that he either had one of the young Yellow-bellied or the full value
which he claimed to be #500 !
It is generally acknowledged amongst amateur breeders that if a bird is loaned
on breeding terms the first chick goes to the owner of the aviary in which it
was reared, the next to the owner of the loaned bird : if three are reared the
first mentioned has two of them and so on. I do not know what happens in the
case of eggs, but it is my firm belief that the resulting young are the sole property
of the owner of the aviary from which they came. I should very much like other
amateur bird breeders in the Avicultural Society to state their views on the
subject through the good offices of the Magazine. Being a breeder of parrots,
etc., for many years I have never before heard of such an outrageous demand--
Shylock demands his pound of flesh!

Black Aphides as Food for Birds
In two recently published books the black or bean aphis has been recom-
mended as a food for zosterops. The green aphis has, of course, long been
known as a food for small insectivorous birds and is probably eaten by a num-
ber of native species--the House Sparrow can sometimes be seen eating it, but
I have never seen any wild bird taking the black aphis and what also suggests
that it is unpalatable is that it is quite conspicuous.
Birds that have never met with this aphis might eat it--once if no more--
and it would be interesting to know of instances of zosterops or others eating it
regularly.

I apologise to members for the long delays experienced in getting
their Magazines bound. This has been due partly to labour disputes!
at the firm we have hitherto been using and also to the difficulty of
finding another willing to meet our comparatively modest demand.
However, I am pleased to report that both Mr. A. J. Swain, 45
New Road, Bromham, Bedford and Messrs. P. G. Chapman &amp; Co. Ltd.,
Kent House Lane, Beckenham, Kent BR3 iLD have agreed to under-
take our binding from henceforth and members should send their
orders, accompanied by payment, direct to either of them. Orders
should state whether the covers and advertisements are to be bound
with the volumes.
The price for binding one year's avicultural magazine in art cloth 1
with gold block on the side, inclusive of the cost of return postage and
packing, may be obtained on application to Mr. Swain or to Messrs.
Chapman. Members should ensure that their volumes are complete
before sending them for binding. Missing back numbers, if still avail-
able, may be obtained from the Society.

By M. D. England (Neatishead, Norfolk)
Barbets are to be found in the tropical parts of the New World, in
Africa, in Asia and eastwards through Indonesia to the Philippines.
In this widespread and mainly attractively-plumaged family, the Red-
headed from Central and South America surely deserves a place among
the most beautiful, although its colour--especially that of the male--
varies considerably over its geographical range. For example, in males
from Ecuador E.b. dequatorialiM the red is limited to the head, whereas
in those from Colombia E.b . bourcieri it extends from the head down
through the breast to where it shades into orange on the belly (see
below).
Unlike many barbets which are very difficult indeed to sex from
their plumage, the sexes in this case are markedly dissimilar, the male
at first glance appearing a predominantly red bird while the female
looks overall green; early workers may indeed be forgiven if they
classified them as different species. There is then never any doubt as
to a bird's sex, and this is so immediately a nestling begins to grow
feathers on its face.
Although males--especially those from the northern parts of the
range of the species--are almost startlingly lovely, the females have a
quiet beauty and might easily be mistaken by the uninitiated for one
of the smaller species of the Asiatic genus Megalaima.
The upperparts of the male, including the tail, are dark green; the
whole head is scarlet, the extent of which, as has been mentioned, is
very variable in a number of fairly distinct races, and ranges from a
red head quickly blending into a yellow throat and breast to a large
area of red from head through the throat and breast shading down
into orange then yellow and finally to a dappled greenish-white. It has

M. D. ENGLAND-BREEDING THE RED-HEADED BARBET
a narrow pale blue half-collar round the back of the neck; the legs are
dark grey and the bill very light yellow-horn, looking almost white in
some lights.
The upperparts of the female are similar to those of the male, but
there the similarity ends : she has a black face extending in a thin line
behind the eye, light blue cheeks and superciliary stripe, golden crown
extending as an incomplete collar, and a pale green throat. Her breast
is yellow and the belly and underparts a washy dappled green.
They are not usually noisy birds, the male having a call like a very
rapid, quiet version of a Hoopoe's Upupa epops "poo-poo-poo", so
rapid in fact as to be roughly reproduceable by saying " brroooo ..."
with slightly open lips and vibrating tongue. (It is interesting that a
slower version--with distinct " poos "--is used by the Red-fronted
Barbet Tricholaema diadematum and one slower still by the Pied
Barbet Lybius leucomelas .)
Both sexes have conversational notes consisting of a soft " cluck-
cluck ", a seductive variant of which is used when offering food to a
youngster and persuading it to feed. The young in the nest keep up,
for quite long periods, what can only be described as a rapidly repeated
ticking, which ceases when they climb up to the entrance hole. When
the young are out of the nest the parents use a harsh " nark, nark "
as a warning or scolding note.
As a family, barbets have in captivity a reputation for being very |
destructive to the woodwork of aviaries, to such an extent that they
have never been very popular and my friends' warnings, when I said
that I was hoping to study the family, led to my housing my first two I
species in steel-framed aviaries. However, these forebodings proved j
unjustified and in my opinion the bad reputation is quite undeserved.
I admit that, although amusing, it must have been annoying when a j
barbet at the London Zoo, having bored into a log, bored right through
it and then through a very solid door behind the log into a room ;
beyond (Olney, 1972). Plowever, the only sign of destruction I have 1
experienced--and I have ten different species of barbet at the
moment--was when a Gaudy Barbet Megalaima mystacophanes 1
started pecking at a part of the aviary framework which proved to be
infested with " woodworm ". Aviary damage can nearly always be
avoided by providing plenty of rotting logs to which the birds can
devote their almost inexhaustible boring propensity. It may not be
inappropriate here to mention that one should not allow oneself to be
over-optimistic when birds appear to be boring a nest hole. Holes are j
bored for roosting, to find food and, apparently, just for something
to do, while some species bore, in the autumn, a hole which will be
used for nesting the following summer.
Admittedly barbets have other faults from an avicultural point of
view : they are messy, they need expensive food and are very wasteful

in their feeding habits. Many a sultana or apparently choice titbit is
picked up only to be discarded--a favourite and unpleasant habit is to
drop it in the water dish. Being frugivorous, they foul their perches
very quickly by wiping their sticky bills on them and their droppings
are copious; some species have voices which are either intolerably loud
or exasperatingly repetitive and monotonous.
However the assets of many members of the family more than
balance this rather formidable list of disadvantages. Most are attrac-
tively plumaged, they are active and inquisitive and have most inter-
esting breeding habits; many readily become fearless of those who look
after them; all have an anatomical characteristic which is most inter-
esting but imperfectly understood, the juvenile " heel pads " (Gylden-
stolpe 1917 et al). In short, few families of birds are aviculturally more
rewarding, and not the least of the points in their favour is the fact
that there is still a lot to learn about them. An overriding advantage
is that, at a time when the need to conserve rather than deplete natural
resources should have priority, there are many species of barbet which
are still sufficiently numerous in the wild for it to be permissible for
limited numbers to be taken for aviculture and, even more to the
point, a number of species breed sufficiently readily in captivity for a
stock to be maintained without any importations at all.
Red-headed Barbets are among those with most merits and fewest
vices. They are small (about the size of a Lesser Spotted Woodpecker),
inoffensive, quiet, beautiful, easy to feed and less messy than many of
their relatives. If my own experience is any criterion they are ready
breeders since each of the only two pairs which I have possessed pro-
duced young within a few months of their arrival.
For most of the year Red-headed Barbets are mainly frugivorous,
preferring sultanas soaked and cut into halves but taking apple, pear,
melon, orange and occasionally a little banana. Although I am sure
that many aviculturists manage to " meat them off " on to soft food,
I have never done this because I find that on the whole barbets do not
take readily to it and I prefer to give them food which they appear to
enjoy, although I admit my inability to give them plenty of figs, the
staple food of many species in the wild. However, one pair of Red and
Yellow Barbets which I have seem to relish ordinary dry " out of the
packet " commercial soft food, and this provided me with an oppor-
tunity to get them to take fruit--which they had hitherto refused--
by mixing small pieces of apple and sultana in with it, indeed a reversal
of the usual process.
As breeding time approaches, the diet of Red-headed Barbets makes
a radical change : fruit is almost ignored and living food is sought.
What little courtship there is consists of the male offering mealworms
to his mate, and even maggots, which they normally do not like and
tend to bring up undigested, are eaten in limited quantities. Locusts

are ignored except for feeding young (see later).
They are among the comparatively few species--apart from parrots
and birds of prey--which hold food in a foot while feeding. Locusts
and other creatures with legs or wings to be torn off are held on to a
perch by one foot (sometimes both) and very occasionally a foot is
raised to the beak, usually to remove and clasp food which requires
more tearing up before swallowing. Thus in three adjacent aviaries
I have three species with three different methods of preparing locusts
for food : the Red-headed, using the feet; the Red and Yellow Trachy-
phonus erythrocephalus, holding the insect by a leg or wing and
shaking it until the body flies off the grasped member (England 1973);
and the Golden-whiskered Megalaima chrysopogon , which seizes and
mandibulates the locust in its massive bill, occasionally throwing it up
to catch it another way round, and finally swallowing the lot.
The commencement of serious breeding activity may be expected
when both birds take turns at boring the same hole and when they
spend considerable periods within it. In particular the female, although
she is not actually nesting, may disappear for an hour or more. It is
also very noticeable that the birds surprisingly become much tamer
when breeding; one female which has young as I write will snatch a
locust from my fingers to take to her chicks. Unlike other barbets, j
they do not usually flee from their nest on the approach of man, but
content themselves with poking their head out to see what is happen-
ing. In parenthesis, although they normally perch across a branch or
cling upright to a vertical surface like a woodpecker when searching
for food they can cling upside down on a fragile branch like a tit
(Parus sp.) or a redpoll ( Acanthis sp.) while they often adopt a
Nuthatch-like position when leaving the nest hole, clinging head down-
wards for a few moments just beneath the hole before flying off. Some- ;
times a bird will adopt this unusual position when boring into wood,
and not infrequently a fledgling is fed from above, the parent hanging \
head down. Until I saw this, I had been greatly puzzled as to the
method of feeding large youngsters in the very cramped confines of the j
nest cavity.
In the last two years a pair of each of the races mentioned above
have bred in my aviaries. Pair A (E.b. aequatorialis) are in a densely
planted aviary 24 x 4 x 8 feet with shelter 4I x 2J x 8 feet high. In j
winter it is thermostatically controlled at a minimum temperature of
50*F. (although one or two of last winter's " Norfolk nights " beat the
heating and brought it down to little more than 40*F.).
They are more particular in their feeding than the other pair, limit-
ing themselves to chopped sultanas, nibbles from a half-apple and
mealworms. Maggots are taken very sparingly and then only when 1
the birds are deprived of their favourite foods. Unlike other barbets, j
most of which are avid cuttlefish " bone " eaters, they appear never to

touch it. The only courtship seen was frequent feeding of the female
by the male on mealworms.
Their first youngster was hatched in the lowest of four holes which
they bored in a rotten tree-trunk, about seven inches in diameter, in
their aviary shelter. It appeared to have been a solitary effort, as had
happened with a pair of Red-fronted Barbets two years previously
(England 1973), there being no sign of eggs or chicks thrown out of
the nest. Incubation and fledgling periods were impossible to assess
accurately, although there is no doubt that the latter is long--probably
at least a month--as has been confirmed by pair B.
While the nest contains young a good deal of hammering is heard
from within. When the young are small this can only be by a parent;
indeed it then only occurs when one of the adults is in the hole. Later,
however, I suspected that the growing chicks did it as well and I
thought that--as in some other species--" sawdust " was being made
to absorb the faeces (which were never seen to be carried away by the
parents). This was probably so, but subsequent experience has shown
that the nest cavity is almost certainly enlarged by the adults as the
young grow, especially if there are several of them and they are a very
tight fit, although even at its largest it is remarkably small for what it
has to contain and the youngsters are very cramped (England, in press).
The entrance hole is a very " tight fit ", being usually only a little over
3 cm. in diameter (average of eight holes, 31 mm.).
Male and female take roughly equal turns at boring the hole,
incubation and feeding the young, which is done with food carried in
the bill. Pair A would only take mealworms to the nest, a very un-
balanced diet which I did my best to improve by rolling the mealworms
in Vionate. Fruit they ate themselves but locusts were ignored. They
caused a great deal of worry, once the egg had hatched, by spending
much of their time searching--and sometimes trying to get out of--
the aviary for some food which we could not provide. However, the
titbits of small insects obtained by the time-honoured method of strik-
ing with a stick a leafy branch over an inverted umbrella were not
touched (except later by pair B, which took two green grasshoppers to
the nest).
They eventually disgraced themselves by not only killing their
solitary youngster but eating its brain. One day to my horror I came
upon the male holding the inert body of his offspring under his foot on
a perch, pecking a hole in its head. The female parent was little less
guilty since, standing beside her mate, she reached across him occa-
sionally to share the feast.
This pair subsequently had three " false pregnancies " : three times
they went through all the preliminaries :-- cock feeding hen, both
boring hole, alternate periods of incubation, then nothing except
eggshells on the flight floor. As I write they have bored another hole

and spend a lot of time in it.
Meanwhile pair B (probably E.b. bourcieri) taught me--the hard
way--my sternest avicultural lesson. Ignoring logs in the shelter (where
I prefer them to nest because fledglings are easier to control) in late
June 1974 they bored in a log about 10 inches in diameter in their
flight in a position difficult to watch from outside. Incubation was as
usual by turns but the first sign of hatching was the distressing unsatis-
fied search for something not included in the diet which I was supply-
ing. This pair semed unwilling even to take mealworms to the nest and
obviously thought nothing of the assortment of crawling things which
I laboriously found in the garden. However, I did see them take two
small green grasshoppers to the nest so, in desperation, I gave them
some very small locusts, which they had steadfastly refused to touch
before. Immediately both parents became very excited and flew down
to the food dish before I had even closed the door. Three locusts had
their legs hastily removed and were rushed to the nest: the answer had
been found. For the next fortnight only small locusts, so far as I could
see, were taken to whatever was in the nest (we guessed there must be
three chicks, because it was always three locusts; if any more than this
were given at one feed the surplus were eaten by the parents). So keen
were they that, from being wary if not timid, they would land on the
food pot as it was being put in and the female took locusts from my
fingers.
Since our supply of J. inch-long locusts was not inexhaustible--on
the contrary--we dared not waste them on the parents and so they had
to be given three at a time, a wearying and time consuming process
which very few wives would have undertaken in their husband's
absence, as mine did (quite apart from a nerve-racking period after
fledging).
The young must have been nearly three weeks old when the locust
diet--which appeared at least to be keeping them alive--was supple-
mented by mealworm pupae and later by white mealworms (i.e. those
which had just shed their skin). Later still chopped sultanas and small
pieces of apple rolled in Gevral were taken to the nest. At least a
month went by before the young in the nest could even be heard from
outside and it was still some time before a face appeared at the hole.
The first out was a male; I did not see him leave and the first I knew
was a miserable, neglected-looking little bundle (which by the way,
soon recovered under warmth and became bright and perky) on the
concrete floor of the aviary.
Had I been asked to guess the colour of fledgling Red-headed Barbets
I should have said that I expected them to be dull editions of the
female. I should have been wrong: this youngster was an undoubted
male, complete with red head. So we were soon able to see, from the
faces at the hole, that a male and a female remained in the nest. The

first out seemed so forlorn and the weather so unpromising that I took
him inside the shelter where the parents apparently ignored him; they
were fully engaged in trying to entice the other two to leave the nest.
By nightfall they still seemed not to be aware of him in the shelter so
I took him indoors to hand-rear him. Seldom have I made a bigger
mistake : being wise after events is all too easy and I now suspect that
his miserable death two days later, of a liver disorder, was at least
partly my fault.
He would not gape, so had to be force-fed, a process which he
vigorously resisted. Locusts and mealworms he ejected, pieces of
sultana he swallowed, though apparently with increasing difficulty
because he appeared either to have difficulty in swallowing or chronic
anti-peristalsis. By the second day all solid matter was coming back so,
in order that he should have some nourishment, he was given a high-
protein nectar, but to no avail.
On the day after this first ill-fated youngster left the nest the parents
tried very hard to make the other tv/o follow suit by holding food just
out of reach, even allowing them to nibble at it but never to grasp it.
Instead of coming out they retired to the nest cavity and stopped
appearing at the hole, giving me grave fears that they would starve.
During the afternoon the male entered the box and loud hammering
was heard; I hoped that he was not murdering his offspring. After a
time he appeared with a beakful of wood chippings which he scattered
outside and returned within to repeat the process. The hen meanwhile
started to hammer on the outside of the log, at about the point where
I imagined the nest cavity to be.
After several hours during which I saw no food at all taken to the
nest I felt that I simply had to enter the flight to see what was going on.
I was even determined if necessary to get at the young somehow to see
whether they were still alive, but this was a situation in which matters
would have been simpler in a nest box than in a deep hole in a large
log.
I need not have worried : failing to entice them out, the male from
within and the female from without had worked desperately to cut a
hole at nest level, and when I arrived I could see the two nestlings
through a hole which was already nearly large enough for them to
emerge through. (It incidentally gave me an unexpected and much
desired view of the position which the young perforce adopt in a very
restricted space.) The boring into the nest cavity from the side of the
log is worthy of comment in the light of my previous experience with
Red-fronted Barbets which did something similar, although in that
case the single youngster finally emerged through the original nest
hole and not through the new hole in the side of the log (England
1973). This further instance makes it less unreasonable to conclude
that, instead of it being the work of a predator, a boring into a barbets'

nest may be a part of normal--if not constant--behaviour on the part
of parents whose young appear to be reluctant to emerge from the nest.
When darkness began to fall, instead of leaving the fledglings to the
dangers of a wet and windy night in the flight I shut them and their
parents in the shelter. I erected " ladders " from the floor in all direc-
tions to perches above because at first the young could not fly, although
they continually and over-optimistically launched themselves into
space, to crash to the floor (and once into the water pot, which I had to
remove). Like the young of other barbets which I have bred, they did
not gape but appeared--until they had been out of the nest for about
a fortnight--totally disinterested in food, and accepted it with reluc-
tance after one of their tireless parents had prodded all round their
face with encouraging " clucks ", more often than not refusing it
altogether. However, they flourished--for two or three days. Then the
little male began to " go off ", looking seedier hour by hour until I
knew that night was going to be his last: two out of three, both the
males.
Sure enough, next morning he was not on a perch and I found his
body on the floor in a cranny. I took him to the refrigerator to preserve
the body for a post mortem examination but, just as I was putting it
into a plastic bag, I thought I felt a very slight movement. He was as
near dead as could be and was certainly unconscious, but I had not
the heart to put him in the refrigerator, nor could I summon the cour-
age to put him out of his misery; but what to do with him? I could
think of nothing better than to lay him in a cardboard box in the
shelter until he really was dead. Meanwhile, to crown all, the young
female now had drooping wings and would not accept food at all. Had
they all got their brother's liver disease?
I felt that drugs were useless and heat had not saved the life of the
first one; apparently one could do nothing but stand by and watch a
promising family perish. They had thrived in the nest so what had
changed? The only change that I could think of was from a diet of
100% live food to one in which the parents chose to give an increasing
number of sultanas rolled in a protein concentrate. Even if it were too
late to do any good, at least it could do no harm to withdraw the fruit
and revert to 100% locusts. This strained our resources to the utmost,
since the Red and Yellow Barbets in the next aviary were rearing a
brood on them at the same time.
Several hours later I went to recover the body of the young male, to
find to my astonishment that he was perched on the edge of the card-
board box, admittedly with eyes closed, but looking sufficiently like a
young bird for his father to be trying, quite ineffectually, to get him
to take a locust. So far as I saw, neither youngster took any food at all
that day and I expected a pretty heart-rending sight next morning. On
the contrary, the young female was accepting a locust as I entered the

shelter and her " moribund " brother was on a perch at least a foot off
the ground. A fortnight later both fledglings could fly the whole
length of the flight and were picking up food for themselves, although
still carefully tended by a most wonderful pair of parents.
Without doubt this was the most remarkable experience in a life-
time of aviculture and I still do not quite know what lessons to learn
from it. The old saying " A sick bird is a dead bird ", although over-
pessimistic, has all too much truth in it, but the mind boggles at the
complete recovery from apparent death, with no treatment at all save
starvation, of a young bird rather smaller than a sparrow. There can
be little question that the diet was at fault and it seems probable that
on this occasion an excess of something rather than the more usual
deficiency was responsible, since all was well once their systems had
cleared themselves of sultanas and the high protein food. The Vionate
powder could not have been to blame since this was continued on the
live food, and too little apple had been taken for it to have had an
adverse effect. It is difficult to refrain from wondering whether all
three, instead of two, might still be alive if the first to die had been
allowed a day's starvation and then fed for a while on tiny locusts only.
The first brood were removed as soon as it was certain that they were
feeding themselves because another nest hole was meanwhile being
bored by their parents, chiefly by the male. Regular incubation of the
second clutch was apparently not started until 4th October--five weeks
after the first brood left the nest--but it must have been proceeding
covertly for some time because the second brood, a male and a female,
left the nest on the 9th November. The precocious young male of the
first brood was at about that time not only singing the full adult song
but was trying to feed his sister.
Summary
The Red-headed Barbet, its distribution in the wild and its habits in
captivity are briefly described. Details of the breeding in aviaries in
Norfolk of two pairs of different races and the successful rearing of
young are given, and there is an account of the remarkable recovery
and eventual rearing of an apparently dead young bird. Feeding
methods and boring by the parents into the side of the nest cavity are
described; also the raising of a second brood shortly after the first had
left the nest.

PEKIN ROBIN X BLUE-WINGED SIVA HYBRIDS
By F. C. Barnicoat (Johannesburg, South Africa)

An event that has recently caused a stir in avicultural circles in
South Africa, the breeding of three magnificent hybrids between a
Pekin Robin and a Blue-winged Siva by Mr. Ron Cleaver, Chairman
of the Rand Avicultural Society, will doubtless be of general interest
and worthy of record in the pages of the Avicultural Magazine.
The breeding took place in a large " garden " type aviary, 45 ft. x
24 ft. and averaging 7 ft. in height, entirely lawn and well planted
with a wide variety of trees, shrubs, creepers and vines. Mr. Cleaver
had owned a fine pair of Blue-winged Sivas for six years and at one
stage they caused excitement when they built a nest and eggs were laid.
Regrettably nothing came of this attempt and all hope abruptly ended
with the death of the cock, as soft-billed birds are seldom imported
into South Africa and there was small prospect of securing a replace-
ment. A pair of the much commoner Pekin Robin was added to the
collection some two years ago and as the hen did not live long, the
scene was all unwittingly set for a most surprising and interesting
breeding.
The first intimation of the event was when the Blue-winged Siva
and the Pekin Robin showed interest in an open shallow wire basket
secured in an avocado pear tree; other birds had already built a fairly
bulky grass nest in the basket and the pair more or less flattened out
the abandoned nest and constructed on top of it a neat cup-shaped
nest, using horsehair for the most part. Three eggs were laid in Novem-
ber 1974 and are described as being blue with brown spots. Within

14 days two chicks hatched and both left the nest 14 days later before
being fully feathered or able to fly and both were hustled away into
the densest creeper by the parents whenever anyone approached. They
were mouse grey in colour with very short tails usually held erect and
they were very difficult to see in the large aviary. Providing food that
the parents would accept to feed the young proved a major task. The
usual seeds were always available plus the extremely simple softbill
mixture that Mr. Cleaver provides fresh every day and that consists of
three cupfuls of Pro Nutra added to four hard-boiled eggs finely
mashed without any further additive. Not surprisingly, however, the
parents were only interested in live insects for rearing their young.
Mr. Cleaver had in the past had little success when using mealworms
as the only rearing food for young insectivorous birds, so he put his
faith in maggots procured by hanging up a wire container of liver and
heart, catching the maggots as they fell into a tray below and leaving
them to clean in sand for 12 hours or so. Approximately 75 maggots
were given morning and evening daily, but the parents showed greater
enthusiasm for other sorts of insect and may not have reared the
brood without them. Mr. Cleaver has a swimming pool in his garden
and a number of brown beetles, no doubt attracted by the light in the
pool at night, get drowned in it. These beetles were scooped off the
water with a net every morning and were eagerly taken by the birds.
To avoid the possibility of poisoning the young hybrids no further
chlorine or pool acid was added to the water of the swimming pool,
which very soon went a bright green with the algae, became more
attractive to insect-life in general and helped to solve the problem of
providing live food for the young softbills. Cutworms were also
regarded by the birds as a delicacy and Mr. Cleaver was slipping
home from work to dig for cutworms in the garden to keep the brood
going, and wet sacks were put down in various places to attract crickets
overnight. News of the event spread and soon neighbours, friends and
relations, not to mention all employees in Ron's business, were bringing
contributions! The birds particularly liked small grasshoppers (up to
2 in. in length) and the praying mantis. Small wonder that the story
had a happy ending.
Almost before the babies were independent the parents had started
on their second round. This time they built their nest from scratch in
the fork of a peach tree and everything went as previously even to
there being two babies again. However, exceptionally heavy and con-
tinuous rain set in and finding the insects proved very difficult. It is
thought that lack of sufficient insects was responsible for the loss of the
smaller of the young just after they left the nest in January 1975.
I saw the babies before they had coloured up and again in May 1975
when Ron took me into the aviary and brought all five birds to the
now bare branches of the peach tree by merely holding out his hand.

All are extremely tame and showed themselves beautifully as they
hopped about in the branches within two or three feet of me in anti-
cipation of some live food, although only a few mealworms were
forthcoming in the end. All these hybrids were in top condition and
had the lovely sleek appearance so characteristic of both parent species
when well kept.
And now to the difficult task of describing their plumage. They
show characteristics of both parents and it would be true to say that
they come roughly half way between the Pekin Robin and the Siva.
The first impression gained at a quick glance is of a very light Pekin:
Robin with a lemon rather than dark orange chest and with a tail
nearly double the normal length. The long tail comes, of course, from
the Siva, but it is very noticeably forked at the end like a Pekin Robin's
and not rounded like a Siva's. The most striking feature inherited from
the Siva are the long eyebrow stripes that run right across the head
and peter out virtually on the nape, which are quite as broad as in the
Siva but have come out black without any trace of cobalt. These black
stripes on the heads of the hybrids probably enable them to be easily
sexed as they are broader and darker on the two more highly coloured
birds, so presumably the bird with the thinner, lighter head stripes is
a hen. It is these stripes, too, coupled with their possessing the general
shape and demeanour of the Blue-winged Siva that gives these birds
an appearance so strikingly different from either parent. They also
show very clearly the streaking on the head that characterises the
Siva, prominently on the forehead but fading away rapidly on the
crown. The wings of the hybrids definitely favour the Pekin Robin,
though they are lighter grey and the orange bars on the wing of the
Pekin Robin are much reduced in width and are light yellow and
white rather than orange. The outer edges of the wings are black or
dark grey, but the line is very narrow and there is no trace of blue. The
lemon colour on the chests of the hybrids fades rapidly into very light
grey and almost to white on the belly, in which feature they again
favour the Siva. The dark band at the end of the Pekin Robin's tail,
taking up approximately the last inch has also been inherited and this
dark tip shows up well on the longer tail.
More than enough has been said to show that the hybrids have
inherited features from both parent species. One last word may help
a reader to gain the correct impression of these hybrids : they tend to
favour their father in coloration, but their mother in shape.
Whether one approves of hybrid breeding or not, it is undeniable
that three highly attractive birds with all the tameness and character
found so often in softbilled birds have been produced. They are
probably unique, certainly very interesting and they seem to prove a
close affinity between Leiothrix lutea and Siva cyanouroptera that was
perhaps not fully realised before.

Coturnicops novehoracensis
By P. Scott Stalheim (Mankato, Minn. U.S.A.)
The Yellow Rail is a small, brown crake, resembling a miniature
Corn Crake Crex crex and, like many species of the Rallidae, very
little is known about its behaviour and breeding biology. It has a wide
breeding distribution in the northern United States and southern
Canada, and winters along the Gulf Coast. In addition to the nomi-
nate race, there is a non-migratory race ( goldmani ) known from several
Mexican specimens {e.g. Dickerman, 1971). During three summers
(1971-1973) I made observations on both captive and wild birds in
Minnesota (Stalheim, 1974), and as far as I know this was the first
time the species has bred in captivity. The following notes detail the
care of the captives and their basic breeding biology. A brief summary
of my major findings on breeding behaviour is included, but these will
be reported in greater detail elsewhere.
The adult Yellow Rail is about 12 cm. (5 in.) long. Upperparts
behind the head are alternately striped with dark brown and narrower
fawn stripes; the dark brown stripes have conspicuous transverse
white bars. The crown and ocular stripes are dark brown, the rest of
the face fawn; chin pale fawn to white; throat, breast and belly fawn,
except for indefinite dark brown bars at the sides of the belly. The
white secondaries form a distinctive patch, conspicuous in flight. The
legs and feet are charcoal grey, irides brown, the bill dark olive-green
to black. During the breeding season, however, my adult males were
distinguishable by a pale yellow to orange bill. I sexed my birds by
post-mortem examination or by position during copulation. Measure-
ments of spring and summer adults are : wing chord 80-93 mm. (20);
exposed culmen 12.5-16 mm. (19); weight 42.1-65.4 gms. (13), with
males tending to be a little larger than females (Walkinshaw, 1939).
Juveniles differ from adults by being darker above, with white bars
and spots on the head and neck. This agrees with statements by
Roberts (1932 : ii, 550) on the nominate race and Dickerman (1971)
on the southern race {goldmani), but some authors (Bent, 1926 : 320;
Ridgway and Friedmann, 1941 : 174) have incorrectly identified the
spotted form as the adult.
The rails I observed were obtained from a marsh about two miles
south-west of Waubun, Minnesota (47 0 12&apos; N. 96* oo&apos; W.). The marsh
water is about 35 cm. deep in the spring, but the level drops consider-
ably during the summer (to about 10 cm. in 1972). The main vegeta-
tion was sedge {Carex), cattail ( Typha) and bulrush (&amp;gt; Scripus ). Sora
Porzana Carolina and Virginia Rails Rallus limicola also nested in the
marsh. The vegetation seemed very thick, even for rail habitat, and

<bodyText confidence="0.991597311111111" page_id="56381453"  page_num="134" year="" vol="">
judging by the location of calling and flushing birds, the Yellow Rails
lived in the densest areas (mostly sedge) while Sora and Virginia Rails
were usually found in areas with more cattail and bulrush.
Care of Captives
The best technique for capturing Yellow Rails proved to be hunting
them at night with a pointing dog, bright lights (to make the birds
" freeze ") and hand nets. My first season was a disaster and all twenty
rails captured had died before the end of the year. In 1972 the diet
was improved and rats were controlled with poison, reducing rail
mortality to 30%.
Both seeds and invertebrates have been found in wild Yellow Rail
stomachs (e.g. Walkinshaw, 1939; Stalheim, 1974). My observations of
these birds suggest that they prefer a primarily carnivorous diet, but
take seeds regularly. By trial and error I arrived at a recipe for a
prepared food which included : 8 oz. of Vet's canned dog food, 1 cup
Giezler's " Mynah Bird Meal ", J cup commercial " chick starter ", a
whole boiled egg (including shell), J cup wild bird seed, about 50
mealworms, and 1 tablespoon gelatin powder. The food was mixed
with enough water to make it crumbly. Occasionally aquatic inverte-
brates and grasshoppers were added to the pens, and earthworms and
dead flies were added to the food.
A major problem in caring for captive Yellow Rails was inducing
them to take the prepared food and this had to be done gradually. I
kept newly caught birds in a small holding cage no more than 1.7 m. 2
for at least ten days. During this time plentiful live food was supplied
(e.g. mealworms, earthworms, crippled flies, snails), some of it mixed
with prepared food. Next the rails were released into their main pen
(about 90 m. 2 in 1971 and 1973; 40 m. 2 in 1972). There they had
feeding bowls similar to the ones they had been using (about one bowl
per 10 m. 2 ). I tried to keep some live food in these bowls continuously
for about a week, by which time the rails had usually become adjusted
to the pen and the prepared food. Feeding stations were then reduced
to about one per 20 m. 2 , and the rails were fed on alternate days.
The aviaries were designed so that the rails would be easy to observe.
During the 1971 breeding season a rectangular pen 17.4 m. long x
5.2 m. wide x 3.0 m. high was planted with rows of vegetation radiating
from a central blind, and flooded with several centimetres of water
between the rows. Two corners of the pen had completely dry areas,
each about 2.5 m. x 3.0 m. This pen was designed by Gerald Kauf-
mann (1971) for his intensive study of the Sora and Virginia Rails. ,
Unfortunately Yellow Rails were more secretive than Sora or Virginia
Rails and they spent most of their time within (rather than between)
the rows of vegetation, making observation difficult. One pair formed, :
but no eggs were laid in 1971.
In 1972 I built a new pen in the edge of the marsh at Waubun. This

octagonal pen had radiating tunnels of vegetation which allowed me
to watch the rails even when they were hiding under the tunnels
(Fig. i). In the observation hide there was a sunken metal tank to sit
in, surrounded by observation windows about 30 cm. above the water

dead marsh grass was scattered so the rails could walk on top of the
water, but the only completely dry area was the nesting cover which
was placed in a border about .7 m. wide around the blind. The
greatest advantages of the new pen were that natural live food was
easy to obtain in the adjacent marsh and it thrived in the pen; captives
may have been stimulated by wild Yellow Rails calling nearby, and
the birds were easier to see in the new pen. Three males and two
females were introduced to the pen in 1972. One pair formed and they
built a nest and laid eggs about 25 cm. from my observation window,

In 1973 I kept four males and two females in the pen built by
Kaufmann. One male paired with both of the females consecutively
and each female raised a brood.

Breeding Behaviour
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.973790625" page_id="56381455"  page_num="136" year="" vol="">
The following conclusions are based on observations totalling 250
hours in 1971, 350 hours in 1972 and 15 hours in 1973.
Hostile behaviour
Hostile interactions were uncommon during winter while the birds
were held in an indoor pen, but occasionally hostile displays and
chases were observed. In spring, however, hostile interactions were
frequent between males as soon as the birds were introduced to the
breeding pens (late May). As the breeding seasons progressed, the
territories of subordinate males were reduced until the dominant male
established the entire pen for his territory. Males patrolling their
territory walked through it, stopping frequently to give clicking calls
(a five-note series of metallic notes with the characteristic rhythm :
" tic-tic, tic-tic-tic ", not unlike the tapping of two stones). Upon
encountering an opponent in his territory, the male usually stopped
to give the Clicking call and then chased the opponent, who usually
retreated and gave a Squeak call. The chaser often Clicked again after
the chase.
Most chases involved males, but sometimes when a male encountered
a strange female in his territory, he Clicked and approached her per-
forming the Wing-spread display (both wings fanned out behind and
head stretched toward her). She usually walked away even if he did
not chase her. In these situations, the male seemed to have conflicting
sexual and aggressive tendencies. Once a male encountered a sleeping
female (not his mate) and apparently succeeding in raping her. She
gave Squeak calls until he dismounted and then she retreated.
In 1972 the number of chases decreased when I removed the sub-
ordinate males (almost constant chasing was threatening the lives of
all the males). The remaining male (who was paired to one of the two
females in the pen) continued Clicking and patrolling, and sometimes ;
chased the unpaired female. About four weeks after the removal of
the subordinate males, incubation began and chasing almost stopped
completely. During incubation the male continued patrolling his terri-
tory and Clicking, but he did no chasing. The incubating female
avoided her mate entirely and the male was attempting to pair with
the other female.
Pairing and sexual behaviour
Pairing and sexual behaviour was similar in 1971, 1972 and 1973? 1
but my observations of these activities were much more intense in
1972, and all the counts of behaviour patterns are from 1972 observa-
tions.

The two males which successfully defended territories in the breed-
ing pens also formed lasting pair bonds, while three other males formed
temporary pair bonds which broke when their territories were overrun
by a dominant male. In 1972, the pair that eventually bred performed
the entire repertoire of pairing and sexual behaviour, including one
copulation, during the first week During the first few days, standing
together was the primary pairing activity, but gradually the birds
began performing other activities such as feeding, preening, and sleep-
ing while near each other. Preening the mate and copulations were not
seen until five days after the rails were put in the pen. Except for a
few instances lasting a few seconds, the female did not preen the male,
but I observed him preening her on 50 occasions.
Although a female seldom approached her mate, a male would
approach his female many times by walking toward her or chasing her,
but she usually avoided him. On 87 occasions in 1972 the male was
seen chasing his mate with the apparent intent of copulating; only six
of those attempts resulted in apparently successful copulations. The
female prevented the male from copulating not only by retreating, but
also by hiding under dense vegetation, standing erect, or avoiding a
posterior orientation toward the male. On a few occasions her attempts
to avoid this orientation resulted in a circular precopulatory chase, the
female retreating from the male in a circular path two or three feet in
diameter. As the breeding cycle progressed, the male was less aggressive
toward his mate and she was more often receptive to his copulatory
advances, sometimes not avoiding him at all.
Pairing and sexual behaviour peaked around egg-laying time in
1972, and the last apparently successful copulation (of 23) was seen
two days before incubation began. All pairing and sexual behaviour
between the mates stopped when incubation began in both 1972 and
x 973, but the male tried to re-pair with a new female in both years,
and he succeeded in fathering a second brood in 1973.
Nesting and incubation
My captive Yellow Rails laid one clutch in 1972 and three clutches
in 1973 (one nest deserted, the other two hatched by different females),
but most of my observations were of the 1972 nest which was less than
25 cm. from the blind window. Nest-building was first seen 28 days
before incubation. Both sexes participated in the early stages, when
crude " scrapes " were hollowed out in the vegetation. Three such
potential nest sites were constructed in 1971; in 1972 six were con-
structed of which one was used as an egg nest and another was used
later as a brood nest. While sitting at these potential nest sites, the
male often gave Clunking calls (sounding like a distant knocking on a
door), Croaking calls (sounding like the croak of a Leopard Frog
Rana pipiens ), and a call combining both sounds in alternation, the
Clunks-and-Croaks call. On a few occasions the female approached

her mate while he called at these sites. Neither sex was ever seen
carrying nest material. (The nests could have been constructed without
carrying material, by simply hollowing out and moulding vegetation
around the nest).
The female (at least in 1972) completed the finer details of nest-
building during egg-laying and this activity continued during incuba-
tion. She pulled nest material in, and poked at it, turned in the nest,
and sometimes kicked backwards with her feet. When I pulled away
the vegetation around the nest for a better view, she pulled a canopy
back over the nest as soon as she returned. After the eggs hatched, the
female finished construction of a separate brooding nest.
The egg-laying sequence was not observed, but Peabody (1922 : 42)
suggests than an egg each day is the normal rate in wild Yellow Rails,
and he gives evidence of one egg being laid at night. Of the four
clutches laid by my rails there were two with five eggs (all eggs
hatched), one with four eggs (deserted), and one with an unknown
number of eggs( at least four hatched). Incubation begins about the
time the last egg is laid, resulting in nearly synchronous hatching, as
Terrill (1943) also observed in a nest of wild birds. The period from
the hatching of the first egg to that of the last was about 24 hours in
the two five-egg clutches I watched.
The incubation period could be determined only for the 1972 nest
(17 days). In all three nests I observed, only the female incubated.
During the fifth day of incubation in 1972 I recorded the nest attend-
ance for a 24 hour period. 85% of daylight hours were spent on the
nest, with each bout of incubation averaging 37 minutes (S.D. = 6),
and with periods of inattendance averaging 6.3 minutes (S.D. = 2.5). At
night, the female remained on the nest constantly. Feeding during
incubation must be a critical problem since rails do not have crops for
food storage, and (judging from my captives) the male Yellow Rail
does not relieve or feed his mate. Thus, while off the nest the female
fed intensively, even performing comfort movements (such as shaking,
scratching, and sunning the wings after bathing) while she ate.
Care and development of the young
During hatching, the females were very protective of their nests.
Once when I checked a nest during hatching the female bit my finger.
The newly hatched chicks are wet and at first lie in the nest, lifting only
their heads and giving peeps. After a few hours the chicks sat up,
supporting themselves on their tarsi. Sanitation at the egg nest was not
a serious problem, partly because the brood moved to another nest two
days after hatching. Chicks went to the edge of the nest to defecate
after they were a day old. I did not see the mother remove egg shells
from the nest, but she did crush some shells with her bill and then
pecked them into the bottom of the nest, and she may have eaten some.
The downy young have been described from museum skins (Ridge-

way and Friedmann, 1941), and chicks a few days old were described
(with photo) by Terrill (1943). The newly hatched chicks are com-
pletely black, except for a bright pink bill and charcoal grey legs and
feet. Fig. 2 depicts stages of development of the young. As the birds
mature, the bill gradually becomes paler, being a dull white by the
16th day and turning grey-black by the 24th day. Chicks begin losing
their downy appearance by the 12 th day, when they first begin to show
fawn coloured patches of the juvenal plumage beneath the down of
the sides and auricular area. By the 18th day, feathers predominate
over the down, although the remiges and rectrices do not finish growing

until about the 35 th day, at which time the young are capable of
flight. On the 24th day measurements of three chicks were : wing
chord 44,46,46; exposed culmen 11,11,11; middle toe without claw
27,29,29 mm.; and weight 39,39,46 gms.
The mother first brought food to the nest, including large meal-
worms, about 15 hours after the first egg hatched. Before presenting
them to the young, she softened the mealworms by dunking them
several times and mandibulating them. Food was offered to the chicks'
bills, but the chicks never used special begging postures. During the

first day after hatching some of the young ventured a metre or so
from the nest for a few minutes at a time. Two days after hatching,
the entire brood followed the mother away from the nest, and for the
next two days the chicks moved together as a group, almost always
touching one another.
When they first stood on their toes, at almost two days of age, the
chicks had difficulty in balancing and for about the first five days the
wings were held out, apparently for balance, when feeding or running.
The well developed wing-claw, commonly found in rail chicks, helped
the young to scramble through the vegetation and climb in and out
of the nest.
When the mother Whined (a call much like a dog's whining) and
walked back and forth, the chicks would follow her. She also gave a
Low Moan, a quiet cooing that seemed to calm the chicks, especially
when she brooded them. Chicks gave an assortment of intergrading
peeps and cheeps. The loud and sharp peeps seemed to indicate cold
or hunger because the mother responded by brooding or feeding the
young. The chicks also gave very quiet " wees ", which started and
ended more gradually than the peeps, and which were usually given
while they were being brooded.
The mother brooded the young and fed them both in and out of
the nest for about 17 days, after which they were no longer brooded
during the day. The chicks began feeding on their own five days after
hatching and they were last seen being fed on the 21st day. When
two weeks old the chicks were pecking at food on their own more
often than from the mother's bill.
As the young became less dependent on their mother for food,
warmth and shelter, they spent less time near her. Three weeks after
hatching the juveniles were independent of their mother, although
they could not fly until about the 35th day.
The same male was father to all three broods I observed (there were
three different mothers), and he ignored the eggs as well as the young.

By G. D. Gradwell (North Shields, Tyne and Wear)
In an aviary measuring 21 x 7 x 6 |feet I kept, during 1974, a
pair of Vernal Hanging Parrots together with two hen Blue-crowned
Hanging Parrots, sunbirds, sugarbirds, tanagers, zosterops, yuhinas
and some others. This outside aviary connects with a flight inside a
birdroom which is heated to 50* F. and the birds agreed well together,
the only sign of aggression coming from one of the Blue-crowned.
The milk-based food provided is composed of 4 dessertspoons Oster-
milk, 6 sugar, 1 Nestle's milk and 4 glucose to one quart of water.
Vitamin compound drops were added to this and sponge cake was
soaked in it. Fruit such as apple, banana, pear and grapes together
with tomato, cheese, maggots (bred from meat, not fish), millets
and sunflower seeds were also provided. In the outside flight there
is running water and I noticed that the male Vernal, after eating
sunflower or other seeds, would drink water before going on to the
nectar dish. Also in the outside flight there are two logs of silver
birch Betula alba about two feet high and 15 inches in diameter
and the parent hanging parrots ate the inner bark (the cambium
layer), sometimes quite a lot of it, after eating other foods and
before going to feed the young. The maggots were also eaten by
them and later by the young birds.
The nest was in a wooden box about \\ inches interior diameter
and some 3-4 feet long--it was actually what conveyor belting was
wrapped around for delivery to quarries. The box stood on the ground
leaning against the aviary side at an angle of about 45 0 and there
was no peat, decayed wood or sawdust inside, but only leaves of
Gotoneaster, a layer about 1^ inches deep. The mother collected
these leaves from bushes growing in the flight and carried them to
the nest, sometimes tucked into the rump feathers, but more often
into the breast feathers. The mother is a bird that I bought in 1965

and was exhibited by me. She, her mate and the young were shown
at the 1974 National Exhibition in the breeders' class for parrots.
In the spring of 1974 she laid and incubated three infertile eggs,
later laying another clutch of three and hatching three chicks which
lived for eleven days. On July 3rd, 4th and 5th or 6th three more
eggs were laid and when I looked into the box on July 27 th I saw
three chicks. I was able to observe in some detail the events from
then on, for I was convalescing from an illness and spent a lot of
time watching the birds in the aviary and I kept daily records.
The father took no part in the incubation and was not allowed
by the mother to enter the nest. He always perched on the rim of
the entrance and fed her from there, while at night he roosted in
the inside flight. On July 29th when I inspected the nest with the
aid of a torch, I noticed that the young ones were of a dark reddish
colour as if the skin was inflamed, but I believe this is natural, for
the chicks that died were quite pallid by comparison. One of the
hen Blue-crowned was constantly trying to get into the nest which
was successfully defended by the Vernal.
On August 1 st the father was allowed for the first time to enter
the nest and feed the young, perhaps even brooding them while the
mother was feeding, bathing and preening. The young were getting
grey down by the 4th August and this appeared darker on the 5th,
while the eyes of the chicks were beginning to open. On the 6th I
could hear the young birds calling from a distance of 9 feet and i
they were no longer being continuously brooded during the day. j
By the 8th the eyes were fully open and the calling louder, but on
the 10th the weather became cold and wet and for some reason j
the father stopped feeding the young, but the mother continued to
do it. On the 11 th he resumed feeding the mother, but not the young.
As the nest was then very wet I put sawdust in, but this had the effect
of frightening the mother who kept looking into the nest but would
not enter, so as last when she was at the entrance looking in I made
a loud noise which alarmed her so much that she dived in. By the
12 th the young were well covered with down and I could see them by
the light of the torch moving about. The father at this stage was
trying to entice the mother to the nest, but she only stayed long
enough to feed the chicks and she did not brood them. By this time
the wing quills could be seen and three days later some green was
showing on the wing feathers with body feather sheaths visible on
the 17th. At about this time the nest had again become very wet and
on the 15th the mother carried in more leaves.
The male was by now anxious to get his mate to nest again, but
she attacked him whenever he attempted to mate. The cold weather
continued throughout August and although the nest was very wet
I did not put any more sawdust into it. The young continued to

develop fast and by the 26th they appeared almost ready to leave
the nest; the mother fed them at the entrance and they appeared
there a good deal, though they hastily went back inside on seeing
anyone approach. On the 30th they left the nest, but I put them
back because of cold fog and rain. Next day they came out again
so I put them into a shelter with the parents and that night one of
the young was roosting in the characteristic hanging position. By the

they have been in the aviary ever since. The young were very much
like the parents in general plumage, but they had not the sheen of
the adult birds. The mother has more blue on the throat than the
father but I find the easiest way to tell them apart is by the iris
colour which is white in the male.
The young were quite independent at three weeks after leaving
the nest, eating all the foods and always roosting in the shelter. Now
(May, 1975) I have a Philippine Hanging Parrot incubating three
eggs in a parrakeet nesting box which has nine inches depth of peat
moss in it, but I have not found mates for the two Blue-crowned
which laid eggs in 1973 and 1974--five eggs in each nest in their case.
I am very grateful to Mr. and Mrs. Grantham for all their advice
and help during the time that these hanging parrots were breeding;
also to my wife and children who, of course, cared for the birds during
my illness. My daughter taught the male Vernal to eat the maggots
and I believe that this additional food may have helped the chicks
through the early days of their lives.
As described, the Vernal Hanging Parrot Loriculus vernalis has been bred
by Mr. G. D. Gradwell and this is believed to be the first success. Anyone
knowing of a previous breeding of this species in Great Britain or Northern
Ireland is asked to inform the Secretary or Editor.

By Lawrence Kilham (Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover,
New Hampshire 03755, U.S.A.)
The study of birds in nature can be benefited by studying hand
raised individuals in an aviary. This, at least, has been my experience
with Red-breasted Nuthatches Sitta canadensis. Whereas a previous
communication (Kilham, 1973) gives description of their courtship
studied under these conditions, as well as of the aviary in which they
were kept, the present one deals with actual nesting and successful
fledging of young. There appears to be little in the literature on
captive nuthatches. The only references known to me are those of
Lohrl (1961) who kept individuals of S. canadensis and of the related
Corsican Nuthatch S. whiteheadi, although without breeding them,
and of Meaden (1970) who observed the successful nesting of the
European Nuthatch S. europaea. I have studied the White-breasted
Nuthatch S. carolinensis (Kilham, 1972a) in the same manner as S. \
canadensis as regards courtship, but the birds, although they laid and
incubated eggs, failed to raise young. The present report is, I believe,
the first one of the breeding of S. canadensis in captivity.
My wife and I hand-raised five Red-breasted Nuthatches, all taken
from one nest when in the pin-feather stage in June and I had four
of them, two pairs, in the aviary the following April. By this time, as
a result of conflicts between the males, one pair had become dominant
and was the only one to show signs of breeding. I set up a nest box on ;
15th April. The breeding pair took an immediate interest and the ;
female, hitherto subordinate to her mate, asserted dominance by |
pecking at the male when he came close to the entrance. At times^ j
however, the two entered the box together in great amity, expressing
themselves with soft, low notes. Both worked to " excavate " although
there was little excavating to do. Red-breasted Nuthatches in nature
excavate cavities in semi-rotten stubs, making entrances that just fit
their body size. My nest box was a regular bird box, made to simulate j
in size, depth and diameter of entrance a natural nest cavity and they j
accepted it readily.
The gamut of courtship activities, detailed elsewhere (Kilham, 1973),
included courtship feeding, wing shivering, aerial pursuits, courtship
flights to and from the nest box, and singing by the male. By 6th May
the female was busy bringing in nest material, mostly fine grass and
the male, oddly enough, taking much of it out. This latter is a phenom- ,
enon that I have also noted for S. carolinensis. At the approach of egg- j:
laying and copulations the female appeared plump, calm and leisurely.
Her mate on the other hand appeared restless, and at times aggressive,
as he poked and prodded her into the air for fast pursuit flights.

The female continued to carry in nest material that now included
bits of bark as well as fur from a Woodchuck Marmota monax that I
had found dead on the highway. There were eight eggs in the nest on
28th May. The female did all of the incubating and brooding and the
male continued to feed her, although she often came out to feed her-
self. It was at this time that the male began to plaster the nest entrance
and its vicinity with bits taken from half-oranges. As the bits dried, they
made a sticky, sugary mass. I was continually reminded of the houses
made of candy one reads about in German fairy tales. Red-breasted
Nuthatches have a regular habit of daubing pitch (resin) from various
conifers around their nest entrance in the wild (Kilham, 1972b) and
my nuthatches had seemed to find a reasonable substitute in the
oranges. When I began bringing in freshly cut boughs and logs of
balsam firs Abies balsamea later on, the nuthatches started using the
pitch immediately. The male, however, still used the oranges and the
result was a bizarre mixture.
The eggs hatched on 9th June. The aviary had screening over the
windows of a size large enough to admit insects. The male, in conse-
quence, was able to catch small midges and flies to feed both his mate
and the young. On some occasions both male and female would enter
the nest together. Food brought to the young also included mealworms
(Tenebrionidae), bits of raw meat, and insects, including small moths
that I caught in a light trap at night. Both parents were carrying out
faecal sacs by the end of a week.
When the young were 11 days of age I noted a difference in the way
the male and female took mealworms. Thus while he took four and
fed them to the young immediately, she ate one, fed one to the nest-
lings, then stored four more about the nest box. The male was the
partner taking the greatest interest in the young. He often sang low
musical songs as he flew back and forth from the nest box. He appeared
to take great joy in all his parental duties. The female, on the other
hand, was obviously becoming interested in other things. When the
young were 14 days old she began to follow the male, her wings
shivering, as if again soliciting either courtship feeding or coition.
Her mate, however, appeared too busy to take much interest.
By the time the young were 16 days old they were so skilful at
hiding in the mass of nest material that I was unable to see just how
many there were. There may have been only two, for this was the
number that fledged three days later. It is possible that, with no real
need for the female in a brood so small, she had, in her leisure, become
ready to breed again. Possibly this was why she continued to bring in
nest material. The nestlings now put their heads out of the nest en-
trance at feeding times, making rasping, harsh " grr " notes. In asking
why the begging of young should be so unpleasant I wondered
whether the harshness was not a spur to the parents, feeding being

one way of putting an end to the noise, at least temporarily.
On the day before nest-leaving the male appeared to be a bundle
of activity in comparison with his mate. When I turned on the aviary
lights at dawn, he burst into a full return of courtship, making rapid
" hn, hn " vocalisations as he poked and prodded his mate to take
wing, then pursued her in flight. He also tried to feed her in court-
ship feeding. She wavered her wings but did not accept food. He mean-
while showed no loss of interest in the young. When I gave him a
mealworm, he arranged it to point straight forward in his bill, flew to
the side of the nest, then clung for a moment to sing his bubbling song.
He then fed the young. This seeming joy in life that I have also noted
with pairs of Red-breasted Nuthatches in the wild makes them a most
attractive bird to study.
I noted a phenomenon on the day of nest-leaving that I had also
noted in the wild. The nest entrance had become so sticky by this time
that the parents had to cling to it in just the right way. What would
happen when the inexperienced young ones started to come out? On
the day of nest-leaving the parents stuck small clumps of fur around
the inner nest rim to prevent, I presumed, the young from becoming
stuck. I once found (Kilham, 1972b) a female nuthatch that had
become stuck to the pitch at the entrance to her own nest. There is no
doubt, therefore, that the pitch, which is as sticky as bird lime, can be
a real hazard.
The young, after fledging, clung closely together at the top of a
pole where the male fed them for several days. His mate, meanwhile,
re-entered the nest and by the next day had laid the first egg in a
second clutch of five. The male fed her as well as the two juveniles.
The young did well until 6th June when they started to fly. It was then
that the catastrophe happened. I had a glass door into the aviary
which the parents had learned to avoid so that I had forgotten that it
was a hazard. The young, however, struck it in their first flights and
both died. The second clutch of eggs hatched, but the parents were not
successful in raising their second brood.
In retrospect I think that a limiting factor in getting these Red-
breasted Nuthatches to breed in captivity was lack of plentiful supply
of live insects of just the right kind. On the positive side I think that
having two pairs in the aviary at the start was probably helpful. Con-
flicts with a rival may be helpful in raising birds to the pitch of emotion
needed for successful breeding. There may be many additional factors
that I did not appreciate. It is the search for such factors; the effort
to provide birds with all they need in the way of habitat, artificial as
it may be, that makes the raising of birds such a challenge. This is
particularly so if one is studying them in nature as well as in captivity.
In regard to the pitch around the nest entrance, it should be noted
that nuthatches of various species, European and American, have

NOTES ON THE RED-CAPPED PARROT
Pionopsitta pileata

In 1974 a pair of Red-capped Parrots in my possession produced
two chicks, a male and a female. The former (who incidentally is
strongly spotted yellow on wing-coverts, mantle, rump and tail) differed
from his three brothers hatched in 1973 in that he had only a small
amount of dirty orange-yellow in the middle of his forehead instead
of a precise thin red frontal band. We know also that a number of
imported subjects that, on reaching Europe, showed a completely
green head, later developed the red cap. This confirms that juvenile
dress is in this species rather variable, an uncommon occurrence in
neotropical parrots, except with certainty only a few species of
Amazona and perhaps a single For pus (F. cyanopygius).
The two females I bred, one in 1973 and the other in 1974, were,
on leaving the nest, a little more bluish on the breast, like the adult
female, while the blue on the forehead was almost non-existent (1973)
or completely absent (1974). The very first traces of red colour (males)
and blue (females) began to appear on the forehead on 18-20 Oct-
ober, both in 1973 and 1974, though in the former season the chicks
hatched on 3rd July and in the latter on 3rd August.
The amount of blue on the forehead of the female after the first
moult seems also a variable character. My old imported female
shows only a vague greenish-blue wash, the female of 1973 two or
three bluish feathers and that of 1974 a well defined blue band.
The connections between Pionopsitta and the other neotropical
parrots are uncertain. Only the poorly known Hapalopsittaca and
Gypopsitta genera seem closely related, while possible affinities with
Touit, For pus and Bolhorhynchus are less obvious.

Over a number of years I have had the opportunity to breed
extensively both F.x.xanthopterygius and F.x.spengeli and I can point
out a few more or less relevant similarities and divergences between
them and P. pileata.
P. pileata scratches over the wing, like Forpus and unlike the
majority of neotropical parrots, while P. pileata holds food in the foot
and pairs a foot on the perch and the other on the back of his mate,
like the majority of neotropical parrots and unlike Forpus.
Forpus eggs are very rounded while the eggs of P. pileata are un-
usually elongated and very little or not pyriform*. Less relevant,
due also to the different body size, is the incubation period (19-20
days in F. xanthopterygius (and one or two days longer or shorter in
other species of Forpus ) and 25-26 days in P. pileata) and stay in the
nest of the young (32-36 days in F. xanthopterygius and 48 (in 1973)
-59 (in 1974) in P. pileata. The delay in the last season could be at-
tributed to the later breeding and consequently shorter daylight in
the rearing period.
Another point that would need confirmation concerns sexual ma-
turity. Forpus are able to breed even when six months old, while the
behaviour of the female P. pileata bred in 1973 (who is paired to an
imported male in my possession since 1969) gives me the impression
that sexual maturity is not attained during the breeding season subse-
quent to that of birth.
P. pileata chicks hatch with a rather abundant white down, while
Forpus are at birth practically naked.
Young Forpus after leaving the nest continue to return to it at
night for one or two weeks, while in P. pileata the box is definitely
ignored by both adults and young after fledging. Furthermore male 1
P. pileata seem never to enter the nest during the breeding operations
(with only one doubtful exception in my experience), while male
Forpus usually sleeps inside with the rest of the family.
Forpus are very spiteful and (especially males) often attack and
kill young of their own sex the moment they leave the nest or a few
days later. The Red-capped Parrot is in my experience much more &apos;
tolerant and I have always left the young with their parents the
whole autumn and winter, though if one of them was taken away
even for a short period of one or two days it could not be put back 1
again as the female attacked it.
Very similar is the behaviour of the incubating females of the two
species when disturbed. They puff their plumage, crouching and
slightly rolling with semi-opened beak turned up in a defence-
aggression attitude also reminiscent of Amazona, though the latter also

London, who paid me a visit last summer.

growl, while both the F. xanthopterygius and P. pileata keep silent.
Forpus in the wild and in captivity lay two or three consecutive
clutches every year (with the possible exception of F. cyanopygius
that could be single brooded), while P. pileata is in my experiences
decidedly single brooded.
Another point worth mentioning concerns accumulations of faeces in
the nest. The faeces of Forpus and especially those of P. pileata dry up
on the bottom of the box, retaining their ring or spiral shape, while in
other South American parrots ( e.g . Patagonian Conures or caiques)
the excreta of the young completely disintegrate and in part are carried
or scraped out by the parents, which give to the litter a quite different
aspect. It is probable that more hygienic conditions are typical of those
species who use the log as dormitory all the year round and that no
sanitary measures are taken by those species who enter a cavity for
breeding purposes only, at least in South America.
Finally the warbling song of P. pileata is reminiscent of Forpus but
much more of Triclaria (of which I have a pair). Furthermore both
P. pileata and T. malachitacea, when very frightened or excited, utter
a very similar rasping-mewing sound. The likeness between these two
species (in spite of a rather different beak) is in my opinion not casual
and if one has the opportunity to keep them under observation for a
length of time genuine affinities in general outline (and more in
particular in the shape of the head), flight, behaviour, etc., can be
easily detected. Both are forest birds and in fact they have an almost
identical distribution area.
A single male P. pileata , housed in a flight contiguous to that of my
Purple-bellied Parrots, often tried to court through the wire the female
of the other species when her husband was in the shelter, and Rosemary
Low told me that her male T. malachitacea promptly reacted to the
introduction of a female P. pileata , courting her.
Apart from neotropical parrots I have always had a curious impres-
; sion of strong likeness between Pionopsitta and Opopsitta , though I
admit that I have never seen a living specimen of the latter; museum
skins, photographs and colour plates only. If I compare my birds with
the colour plate of Opopsitta in Forshaw's Australian Parrots, the
one in the Avicultural Magazine (no. 5, 1967) or the photographs in
Robinson's Australian Parrots in Colour, I cannot fail to notice a
singular parallelism in general shape and attitude and in particular in
the flat snaky head. It can be added that sexual dimorphism is in some
way similar. In O. diophthalma marshalli or O. diophthalma virago
for example there is a tendency for a replacement of the red colour on
the forehead of the males by blue in the females. Furthermore the
bulbous lower mandible seems an adaptation of those parrots whose
diet is largely based on berries and the way P. pileata eats the small
fruits of Crataegus , Cotoneaster or Ligustrum, holding them in the

lower mandible, is a little different from that of the other parrots in
my collection. Perhaps this way of feeding saves the juice of some types
of berries.
All that has obviously not the pretence to represent valid proofs;
only a personal impression that the few collected notes on captive
behaviour of Opopsitta seem, however, not to support. These parrots
behave rather like lorikeets or caiques progressing along a perch in a
series of hurried jumps, turning in mid-air, so that at one moment they
have their back to you and the next are facing you.
Another hypothetical link between South American and Australian
parrots has been pointed out by a few authors and involves T. malachi -
tacea on one hand and A. erythropterus on the other. I completely
agree in that the two species under certain visual angles are surprisingly
similar. To take an example, the black and white photograph of young
Aprosmictus on page 46 of Groen's Australian Parrakeets could well
be passed off for Triclaria, but for a little smaller beak and slimmer
body.
This theoretical bridge between Australia and south-eastern South
America could have, in my opinion, a valid middle pier in Madagascar
and neighbouring islands where Coracopsis parrots live, a genus not
closely related to Ethiopian fauna. The Naples Zoo has four Great
Vasa Parrots C . vasa and the immediate impression I had when for
the first time I saw them was that they truly were an archaic type of
Alisterus.
Perhaps an analysis of erythrocytary antigens and the electropho-
retic patterns of egg-white proteins (less easy due to the difficulty in
getting the eggs of certain species) carried out on Triclaria, Pionopsitta ,
Coracopsis , Alisterus and Aprosmictus could help to clarify whether
these more or less evident similarities have a more profound signifi-
cance or not.

Serinus a. alario
By F. C. Barnicoat (Johannesburg, South Africa)
The cardueline finches are a large group and widely spread, occurr-
ing in both Old and New Worlds. They are ideally suitable as aviary
birds, for they are easily fed on a seed mixture and green food and are
not generally speaking aggressive, so mix well with other species. One
of the fairly typical genera is Serinus represented in Europe by the
Citril Finch and the Serin and by many more species in Africa, about
a dozen occurring in South Africa where they are variously known as
serins, canaries or seedeaters, and they form an important sub-section
in our bird shows. The Black-headed Canary is now placed in Serinus
where it undoubtedly belongs, even though it seems rather the odd
one out as regards colour, for most serins have some yellow in the
plumage. The Black-head, as it is locally known, has a black head and
upper chest, russet brown back and white underparts. On the grounds
of its strikingly different colour pattern and its marked sexual dimor-
phism (the hen is a contrast to her mate, having a duller brown back
and grey over the rest of her body) the Black-head was placed in a
genus of its own-- Alario. It is very much a southern and western
species, being practically confined to Cape Province. There are two
subspecies, the other, Serinus alario leucolaema being found in more
northerly areas, mainly in South West Africa. It is known as the
Damara or King Black-head and differs in having attractive white
stripes on its black head, while the female is generally paler, especially
about the throat. This is an important bird in South African aviculture
and is greatly sought after for showing and for the breeding of
"mules". I was given a pair of Black-heads early in 1973 by a fellow
fancier whose line is domesticated Canaries, also Serinus , of course. He
had returned from the Cape with more than he needed for the breed-
ing of mules and at first I was not particularly enthusiastic about my
acquisition, but the cock soon proved such an excellent and indefatig-
able songster that I would not have parted with them for anything.
I tried them in several of my aviaries, but they always refused to
sleep in the shelter and roosted out in all weathers; however they
proved extremely hardy and were none the worse for their rather
Spartan way of life. Seed and water with an occasional spinach leaf
was their simple fare.
In September 1974 I was able to give them an aviary that I felt
would be suitable for breeding. It measured 6 ft. x 6 ft. and was
divided roughly into half shelter and half flight. Though two sides of
the aviary and half the shelter roof were of solid material, most of the
shelter part was of transparent fibre glass so there was enough light for

the growing of small cypress trees to provide nesting sites. In this
shelter the Black-heads soon set about building in the fork of a cypress
about a metre from the ground. The nest was of the typical cup shape
and was beautifully constructed of strands of grass, unravelled string
and cotton wool. It was so neat as to be a delight to see, but it did give
the impression of being very small for the size of the hen and when she
sat in it she provided a spectacle that appeared rather top heavy. The
nest was in an open position, but this did not matter since the birds had
the aviary to themselves and the nest was well sheltered from the
weather. Perhaps herein lies the reason why more carduelines are not
successfully raised in our aviaries; however under these conditions
everything went well. I measured one of the clutch of three eggs and
found it to be 18 x 13 mm. which is rather larger than the average
given by Skead i960 (16.7 x 12.5 mm.) though well within the range
of sizes given for the Black-head in his excellent work. The eggs were of
a light turquoise in colour, speckled mainly at the obtuse end with
spots or streaks of a shiny chocolate brown and a few blotches of a
duller lighter brown. Once the hen was sitting I provided soaked and
germinating seed and about two teaspoons of egg food every morning.
The parents were quite used to this by the time the chicks hatched and
no further supplementary foods were given at any stage, nor were the
quantities or frequency increased. I estimated the incubation period
to be 13 days and when I first saw the babies they were pinkish in
colour with prominent patches of fluff on their heads and backs. As
they grew the skin of their heads, backs and wings rapidly darkened
and at seven days they were beginning to feather and they developed
into three very attractive nestlings of a pretty cinnamon brown
streaked with darker brown on the back and grey, streaked darker, on
the front. They left the nest on the 15th day and all three proved to
be hens. They did not assume the adult plumage and lose the streaky
plumage of the juvenile until they were four months old. The parents
subsequently built and laid twice; on both occasions the clutch was of
three eggs, but the nests were not built securely enough. The first broke
at the side and tilted to such an extent that the eggs fell to the ground;
the second was not adequately lined and the eggs fell one by one
through the bottom. I was misled into blaming the cock until I saw

By M. R. Lubbock (Curator)
One of the rarest ducks in the world, living in areas of deep, shady
forest where streams and marshes are abundant, is the White-winged
Wood Duck Cairina scutulata of South-east Asia. Its habitat is
rapidly disappearing with Man's agricultural progress, since vast tracts
of rain forest are being cut down to make way for crops on the fertile
soils.
The Wood Duck is rather similar to its relative, the wild Muscovy
Duck Cairina moschata, except in the comparative sizes of the males
and females : there is a very small difference in the Wood Duck, while
in the Muscovy the two sexes differ considerably.
Only a few live specimens were brought out of Asia during the last
fifty years and it is only in the last ten years that any great effort has
been made to ensure a future for the species by captive breeding. In
1969 five males and one female arrived at the Wildfowl Trust, Slim-
bridge, from Assam, and these were followed in 1970 by two males and
four females. They had been hand-reared from wild eggs by Mr.
Sam MacKenzie and formed the nucleus of a breeding stock. Losses
occurred during the first two years while the birds were acclimatising,
so only three breeding pairs were finally made out of the original ten
ducks.
One pair was left free-winged and given a separate aviary with
plenty of swimming water, a surrounding of thick foliage and large
nesting boxes. These nesting boxes measured 2 ft. in length, 1 ft. wide
and 1 ft. high and were placed 2-3 feet from the ground. Entrance
holes of 6 in. diameter led into the boxes, which had 2 in. of earth
followed by 2 in. of peat with a sprinkling of dried grass, at the
bottom for the birds to nest on. A second and third pair were pinioned
and given a larger pen. These pairs were provided with ramps up to
the nesting box entrance holes in order to make access easier.
All pairs were kept on a high protein diet of dog biscuit meal, dried
shrimp, chopped fish, wheat, brown bread and 22% turkey starter
crumbs. Water was added and the mixture placed in an open food
bowl. The ducks thrived.
The full-winged female that had arrived in 1969, was the first bird
to lay in 1971. White-winged Wood Ducks produce an average of
12 eggs in one clutch, taking 33 days to incubate them without any
help from the male.
The eggs were left with the female, but just after they hatched the
drake was removed to another aviary as he became rather aggressive
towards the young.
The female hatched ten chicks and successfully reared eight of them.

The young had access to the same food mixture as the parents, plus
some dry starter crumbs and plenty of duckweed. Brown bread was
also thrown onto the water as the young tended to eat only whilst they
were swimming. They were very slow-growing in comparison with
most other waterfowl.
Breeding again occurred in 1972, with fairly good success, and
one of the pinioned pairs also laid; but in 1973, because of incu-
bator failures, only three ducklings were reared. These three had
been neglected by the female and needed to be rescued from their
aviary after flooding in extremely bad weather. The ducklings were
taken off the rather complicated diet which they had been receiving
and were given the same treatment as other hand-reared waterfowl
in the collection. Their new diet consisted of chick starter crumbs,
then grower's pellets, followed by wheat. This proved to be as good
as their previous diet.
The most successful year of all for the White-winged Wood Ducks
was 1974: thirty young were hand-reared to maturity. One of the
original pairs laid two clutches, which was the first time that a
repeat clutch had been laid in captivity. One pair, that had origin-
ally been raised by the parent in 1971 and had shown a bit of white
coloration in the region of the head, bred for the first time. Five of
their eggs hatched, the young were reared and these showed even
more white feathering.
Now that a fairly sizeable stock is being produced at Slimbridge,
pairs are being sent on loan to well-known breeders and zoos, such
as Jersey. It is hoped that the Wildfowl Trust will be able to repeat
the " Noah's Ark " operation which proved so successful in saving
the Hawaiian Goose and perhaps eventually return some birds to
the wild.
The National Zoo at Washington had earlier been given two pairs
of White-winged Wood Ducks from Assam by Sam MacKenzie but,
because of problems with importation from certain European coun-
tries, they were held up for two years and maintained by Dr. Dela-
cour at Cleres in France. Unfortunately, during that time, one female
died. In 1975, a pair finally reached Washington but, not long after
being released from quarantine, the male died. Two pairs are being
sent from the Wildfowl Trust to the National Zoo but there are new
regulations in force concerning the importation of endangered species
and the White-winged Wood Duck is on the list of endangered birds
so the ducks are temporarily delayed while a permit is issued. It is
hoped that from these birds a breeding stock for the U.S.A. will
eventually be built up.

(Cacatua goffini)
By E. G. B. Schulte (Eindhoven, Holland)
Goffin's Cockatoo is confined to the Tanimbar Islands, Indonesia.
For a description and plate of this small white cockatoo see Forshaw
(1973). Finsch (1863) described the species from birds in the Amster-
dam Zoo. He and other 19th century authors described this bird,
strangely enough, without the red lores (Russ, 1881 and Greene, 1884).
In March 1974 I obtained a pair of these cockatoos. As I had no
outside aviary available at that time, I placed them in a box cage
87 x 44 x 70 cm. high, furnished with a nest box 25 x 25 x 40 cm.
high. They were rather shy, especially the male, and disappeared into
the box when anyone neared the cage : therefore only now and then
was there an opportunity to inspect the nest. In May 1974 I saw them
mating. Their display is simple : the female squats down and erects
her tail, followed by mutual preening of each other's anal area;
mating then follows. On 15th June I found three eggs in the box.
During the day both birds remained in the nest except when feeding:
in the evening I usually saw one bird outside. On 29th June there were
still three eggs. Two days later on 1st July I heard a chick; it made the
same sound as a young Gockatiel Nymphicus hollandicus being fed.
On 2nd August when both parents were outside the nest box I saw one
chick, almost fully feathered and on 7th September this chick was
found dead in the nest.
On 5th October I again found three eggs (40 x 27, 38 x 26 and
38 x 26 mm.), young were heard on 9th October and on 1st November
I saw two chicks. They had pale yellow down and pin feathers were
visible on head and wings. On 23rd November their plumage was
complete, only the tail feathers were not fully developed. Days were
shortening but the chicks were fed after dark. On 18th December
when they were about ten weeks old, the first young one left the nest,
followed by the second the next day. They looked like the adults and
had black irides. Three weeks later the young birds were independent;
they had been fed mostly by the mother. Soon after this they were
moved to another cage. In May 1975 the cockatoos nested again,
hatching two chicks and I had a better opportunity to inspect them.
For the first two weeks they are almost naked, having only a little pale
yellow down and in the third week the first feather sheaths appear on
the head and wings.
The food given consisted of sunflower, canary and hemp seed, oats,
a soft food for parrots, soaked maize, bread and large quantities of
chickweed. The birds did not eat fruit.

NOTES ON THE DISPLAY OF THE BOOTED RACQUET-TAIL
HUMMINGBIRD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99801146875" page_id="56381477"  page_num="156" year="" vol="">
By A. J. Mobbs (Walsall, West Midlands)
Although Booted Racquet-tail Hummingbirds Ocreatus are brought
into Britain (and the Continent) fairly regularly, it was not until
August 1974, that I added a male to my collection. I did purchase
a female in 1968; this bird had been with me two years, when it died
from an unknown cause.
The male was given to me by my friend Karl-L. Schuchmann (Weiter-
stadt, West Germany). It was one of two which he imported himself,
with a number of other species. I was promised the bird soon after my
friend received it, but it did not actually come into my possession until
August 1974, when my wife brought it back with her after visiting our
friend and his wife. Upon arriving home with the bird, it was taken
carefully from the " jacket " in which it had travelled and placed into
an already prepared cage. Within ten minutes, the bird was bathing
in the saucer of water provided and half an hour later, when the
birdroom lights were dimmed, was seen to go to roost immediately.
The racquet-tail went into a complete moult only a matter of days
after my receiving it. Fortunately the change did not affect the moult
and it was completed without complications in 12 weeks. Two weeks
later the bird was seen to display for the first time, when released from
its cage prior to cleaning out. The display was directed towards a male
Green-vented Whitetip Urosticte benjamini which is housed in my
communal flight. Since then, whenever the whitetip escapes from the
communal flight and hovers or perches near the racquet-tail's cage,
the latter will display continually. Of all my hummingbirds the white-
tip is the only one which triggers off the display. It is not always
possible to detennine why certain species trigger off displays in others.
For instance, my male Horned Sungem Heliactin cornuta will almost
lose control, so intense is its display, if the male Stripe-breasted Star-
throat Heliomaster squamosus should leave the communal flight and
hover near the sungem's cage. The sungem will also direct its display
towards the starthroat even when the latter is perching quietly in the

communal flight some five feet away. Admittedly, however,at such
times the display of the sungem is less intense (Mobbs 1973).
As mentioned in an earlier paper on Eriocnemis (Mobbs 1974), I feel
certain the displays of many species of hummingbirds begin as aggres-
sion, only becoming mating display when a responsive female is found.
If this theory is correct, the racquet-tail may direct its display towards
the whitetip because of certain similarities between the species. The
most noticeable of these being the wing action which is used each time
the birds alight, in that the wings are held at an angle of 30-45 degrees
for a second before being folded into normal resting position. The
flight of Ocreatus and Urosticte is also very similar, being rapid but
with rather slow wing beats. Although it probably has little to do with
the reason why the racquet-tail displays to the whitetip, it is interesting
to note that female whitetips (both benjamini and ruficrissa ) are very
much like female Ocreatus except that the latter have " leg puffs " and
bodily are only half the size.
The display of the racquet-tail is performed both on the wing and
while perched. In both cases the body is held in a horizontal position
and the tail is vigorously lashed from side to side, thus producing a
fairly loud noise. The tail movements form an arc, although so fast are
they, the tail appears to be moved in a circular motion. When the
aerial display is performed, as well as the tail movements described,
the bird will also raise and lower the legs, thus highlighting the downy,
white leg puffs. If extremely aroused, the bird will bring its head up
slightly and raise the legs in the manner of the Eriocnemis (Mobbs
! 974 ), th us displaying the leg puffs to even greater advantage. While
performing the aerial display, the bird may remain in one position,
move from side to side, or move backwards and forwards.
When displaying on the perch, as well as the tail movements already
described, the bird will continually twitch the wings and raise the
body well away from the perch to emphasize the white leg puffs.
During the perched display, a faint buzzing noise is uttered; whether
or not this is used during the aerial display, I have been unable to
ascertain, mainly because of the noise made by the wings and tail
at such times.
As mentioned earlier, racquet-tails are imported fairly regularly,
although it is rare for males in adult plumage to be brought in.
Ocreatus underwoodii underwoodii is brought in less frequently than
Ocreatus u. per anus. Adult males of the former have upperparts
shining green; throat and breast glittering green with remainder of
underparts shining green. The downy leg puffs are white; the forked
tail is dull blue-black with the two outer feathers much longer than
the remainder and terminating in a bare shaft and shining purple-
black spatula.
Females have upperparts shining green; underparts white, spotted

with shining green; leg puffs white. The forked tail has central feathers
of shining green, outer blue-black tipped with white.
Immature males are very much like females but can sometimes be
picked out by their stance; i.e. males appear to sit across the perch,
whereas females sit upright (pers. comm. M. W. Clifford), or by their
crown feathers; i.e. shining in the male, more dull in the female (pers.
comm. Karl-L. Schuchmann).
Adult male peranus differ from underwoodii in that they have brown
leg puffs (often less dense than those of the white feathered race) and
black instead of purple-black spatulas. Females and immature males
are much like those of underwoodii, except for the brown leg puffs.
Immature males of both races appear to have no fixed pattern when
moulting into adult plumage. Some may commence by growing the
elongated tail feathers of the adult, whereas others will moult the
underparts first.
Newly imported racquet-tails usually arrive in a somewhat distressed
state and because of this may require extra care if they are to survive.
Even when successfully established, the species does not appear to be
long-lived in captivity. I prefer to house racquet-tails in a box-cage,
either singly or in pairs; however, once fully established it is rare for a
pair to remain compatible in the confines of a cage. I have seen these
birds housed with larger species in a communal flight, but due to their
somewhat nervous disposition, it is not a practice I would recommend.
Although it is not uncommon for a female hummingbird to build a
nest and sometimes lay eggs, due to the difficulty experienced when
attempting to persuade a pair to mate, rarely does one hear of fertile
eggs being laid. Earlier this year, Frau Schulze (Bamberg, West
Germany) not only succeeded in persuading a pair of Ocreatus u.
underwoodii to go to nest, but also in keeping the resulting young alive
for seven days.
At the time of this unsuccessful but nevertheless notable breeding
attempt, I was staying with friends in West Germany. It was therefore
arranged that we should visit Frau Schulze the day before I was due
to return home. Unfortunately the young birds died the day prior to
my visit; however, I was able to photograph the nest; also the female
(see plate), and inspect the young which Frau Schulze intended to
preserve in spirit.
Details of this breeding attempt are as follows : The pair of racquet-
tails were acquired during the autumn of 1973. In 1974 (exact date
unknown), the female laid one egg. It appears the bird experienced
difficulty passing the egg and because of this was almost lost.
At the beginning of February 1975, the female commenced nest
building; it took three weeks for the nest to be completed. Material
used included cotton wool, dog hair, moss and cobweb. The first egg
was laid on 23rd February; the second two days later on the 25th.

Both eggs were laid between 8.30 and 9.00 a.m. It was noticed that
immediately after egg laying, the female would leave the nest and
take a long drink from a feeder. After the second egg was laid, the
male had to be removed from the flight as the female became extremely
aggressive towards him.
The first chick appeared on 13th March, the second the following
day. It was noticed that each time the female left the nest to obtain
food for the young, she always carried nesting material back to the
nest. On 20th March, both young were found dead in the nest. Upon
examination one of the youngsters was found to have a large amount
of cotton wool in the oesophagus. A detailed account of this breeding
attempt will be appearing in Die Gefiederte Welt.
After the loss of her young, the female racquet-tail came into full
breeding condition again; however, by this time the male was in heavy
moult, thus thwarting any chance of an immediate second breeding
attempt.

SPANISH NOTES--5
By Robin L. Restall (Caracas, Venezuela)
The Serin
The European Serin Serinus serinus occasionally appears in
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.9837046" page_id="56381482"  page_num="159" year="" vol="">
collections in Britain. However, it is an accredited British bird; but far
from being the rare visitor suggested by most handbooks, it is now a
regular breeding bird in southern England and is, of course, entitled
to the full protection of the law. I have never seen the Serin offered
for sale in Britain and any aviculturist fortunate enough to breed it
would almost certainly quail at attempting to close-ring the nestlings.
Supply lines are, therefore, tenuous and most Serins will find their way
to British aviaries in the hand luggage of returning holiday-makers.
During my five years living in Spain, I had considerable experience
with the species, some of which I shall relate below in the hope that it
may assist somebody in their endeavours. If only it prompts a member
with a more profound or relevant experience to write, it will be worth
it.
There are many Serinus species, nearly all being truly African birds,
and the vast majority display the highly desirable characteristics (that
is from an avicultural point of view) of being hardy and easy to cater
for. They live almost exclusively on grass seeds and seeds of other small
plants, even rearing their young on this diet. Most of them are vigorous
and robust species, often very aggressive towards other male finches
when breeding. The Green Singing Finch S. mozambicus is a classic

example, and to the finch breeders of the Canary Islands it was known,
almost invariably, as the Valiant One or the Brave One.
In contrast, the two Eurasian serins (S. serinus and S. pusillus );
seem to have a delicacy that catches aviculturists unaware and every
aviculturist I know who has kept either, has to admit to having had
some " bad luck One can almost hear " Well, they are serins, aren't
they? So they will take millet--all African finches do. But, being in
the canary family, they will need some canary seed too ". It never
seems to occur to some folk that not every species of seed-eater will
thrive on treatment suitable only for domestic Budgerigars.
The first entry for Serins in my journal is in 1970 as follows :
&quot; Serin. Price 15 to 100 pesetas (value then 9p to 7op) depending on sex and
age. Received quite a few from April to July. Very wild and not one steadied
down. I tried the odd males--Spanish style--in small cages in the kitchen and
hanging in the tree outside the door. The only result of the latter was that the 1
male Serins in the garden would fly down to the cage to attack the captive bird
as a local rival. I have kept adults of both sexes, and juveniles, and suspect that
the latter may be sexed by rump colour, that of the immature male being clearer !
and nearer to yellow. Adult male very easy to identify. Food: took everything
in Canary mixture, plus the extras that I supplied. Favourite seed seemed to be j
lettuce, followed by niger. Also took to seeding chickweed instantly."
Then in 1971, I have another entry (24th January): "Bought four birds. !
A very well-marked male at 100 pesetas (app. 6op) from one dealer, a female 1
for 20 pesetas (approx. i2p) then another fellow had a pair that I bought for
50 pesetas (sop). Placed in a small cage; within an hour all four had bathed
and seemed very content and settled in--in contrast to the birds bought last
year. Again lettuce seed appeared to be the favourite. On the same occasion I
saw a Serin x Canary on offer. It was larger than a Serin, but showed its
parentage clearly. The breeder was very proud of it and extolled its virtues as j
a songster. It was clearly a male but the yellow of forehead, rump and breast
were not so pure as the corresponding parts on a pure Serin."
I bought a few more Serins that year; each time they settled in well. ;
By then I just put them into a 7 ft. flight cage that has seeds and
screenings to a depth of about 3 ins. They were sufficiently comfortable
for the males to twitter their little songs and chase each other, but
nothing ever developed.
During 1972, a neighbour's gardener took a brood of wild Serins
and placed them in a wire cage by the nest. At what stage in their
development he did this I do not know. According to him, the parents j
had continued to raise the infants in the cage, then through the wire, |
up to weaning. Eventually, he had a brood of independent and very j
steady young Serins. This man announced that he could take any
number of birds in this way, that they were worth a lot of money,;
being virtually cage-bred, and offered them to me for about #5. He
thought that I was only trying to beat him down when I told him the 1
prices in the market. Happily the season was too far advanced for him
to take any more. The sequel to his story, however, is that the following
year he did it again--this time with Golden Orioles. I refused to take j
them (exercising great will-power, I can assure you) and eventually;
he released them. I am happy to say that his rather unsuccessful career

as a bird trapper ended then because he gave up gardening and moved
into a city flat to work in a factory.
My entry for 19th June, 1973 read :
" Yesterday, at about 8.45 p.m., I went out to the garden and put the car
away, when I found a newly-fledged Serin, incapable of flight it seemed, on the
ground near the gate. For fear of cats, I picked it up, then remembering the
gardener's story, fetched an old canary cage from the garage and placed the
bird in it. I went out into the street to bring the car in and saw a second fledg-
ling, roosting, eyes shut, in the middle of the road ! This one went into the cage
also. On my way into the house for a hammer and nails to fix the cage in the
tree, I found a third bird sitting, huddled on the front door step. The nest had
been placed in a crotch of a large branch about 5 ft. out from the trunk; the
thorns on this tree were 6 ins. long and everywhere. I compromised by hanging
the cage on the trunk just below the leaf canopy.
Next morning at 6 a.m. I saw the adult female find the cage and try to enter.
At 6.10 she returned with food and fed the young through the wire. It seemed
an almost natural thing to do. I kept a constant watch until 7.45 a.m., during
which times the birds were fed many times.
At 7.30 p.m. a fourth fledgling was discovered in the garden. It, too, was
unable to fly and rapidly joined its brethren. At 7.45 p.m. the female was seen
feeding all four.
21 st June: Female still returning regularly to feed the young. The male is
 |frequently nearby, as it was during the nestling period, to sing. This song
is not the continuous rolling song of early spring (which is probably both com-
petitive and for courtship) but separated, clear and complete song phrases. This
may well have the function of imprinting the immature birds with their species
recognition sounds. The male has never once been seen to feed the fledglings.
22nd June: The four birds sit in a row and, when seen from below, the
striations on the breast can clearly be seen to be different. Frank Meaden told
me once that he thought that fledgling Serins can be sexed in this way. My
sketch will explain better than words. Covered floor of cage with mixed seeds
and included pot of water.
23rd June: Female arrived to feed the young birds at intervals of 10 to 20
minutes. They are much quieter now and have all but stopped the near incessant
squeaking. They do not beg so loudly nor fight to be fed first so fiercely.
! Although I have not seen them feed themselves yet, it might be that they are
sampling a little.
1 st July: Female did not come at all today. At least two of the young Serins
definitely feeding themselves.
2nd July: Still no sign of mother. I placed all four Serins into a 7 ft. flight
cage with a pair of Wild Canaries. Two began feeding instantly but the other
two began pursuing the two Canaries and begging to be fed. They were utterly
ignored. One of these two was excessively thin and frail (and caused no surprise

7th July: One of the immature Serins drowned itself in the water bowl. The
surviving two (believed to be male and female) thrive.
Looking back on this exercise now, I believe that it would have
helped the fledglings tremendously if I had placed an independent
young Serin in the cage with them. This bird would not have prevented
the mother from continuing to feed the young but would have pro-
vided both an example and stimulus to the others to feed. This example
would normally have been provided by the mother during the latter
days of the weaning period when she ran down her feeding service, by
which time she would be being pursued by hungry and demanding
youngsters.
Without further discussion, I would like to summarize the Serin
from my experience :
In cage : Males are better kept alone. They sing frequently and for
most of the year, except when moulting. If more than one male is kept
in a cage with a female serin (almost any species will do), there is
likely to be a lot of bickering and possibly serious fighting. A fit male
may also chase a female too much.
In aviary: The average male will be content with a territory
inevitably larger than the aviary. If more than one male is present,
take care to see that they do not fight too seriously. This is most likely
to happen in the spring with the lengthening daylight.
Acclimatising (or adaptability to captivity) : It must be regarded as
a delicate species when newly caught. If wild birds are acquired, they
should be taken in the autumn after the moult when losses will be
minimised. Unmoulted immatures are delicate and both sexes are
delicate in the spring. They seem to suffer from the shock of capture
and take less readily to hard dry seed in the spring. The old pros in
Spain would not touch them then, swearing that paired-up birds will
invariably die if caught.
Travel: Of all the species that I, personally, transported the Serin
was the most delicate and was the only species that always gave me
cause for concern. Occasionally one would be dead on arrival (after
about eight hours journeying) and on more than one occasion a bird
that I had kept for six months would die within a day of arrival.
Food : A wide variety of small seed, including those not normally
contained in commercial mixtures, such as lettuce, grass, alder, birch
and all the weeds.
A fortnight before returning to England in summer 1974, en route
to Caracas, I was brought two nestling Serins, pitched from a nest by
latent-vandal schoolboys. I reared these successfully (with the aid of
a plastic ice lolly stick and a dexterous thumb) on a thick paste of baby
food, mashed green grass seeds and Vionate. They weaned very
successfully on fresh green seeds of the annual grass Poa annua .

THE BOBWHITE QUAIL : SOME ASPECTS OF BEHAVIOUR
By R. Unwin Lambert (Reigate, Surrey)
In the summer of 1971 I raised from a pair of Bobwhite Quail Co fi-
rms virginianus four young - two of each sex. These were hatched
under a pair of Barbary Doves Streptopelia d. roseogrisea (" risoria ")
and reared until approximately four weeks, old in a heated enclosure.
They were then transferred into a small aviary having a ground mea-
surement of 6 ft. 6 in. x 4 ft. in the company of two hen Japanese
Quail Coturnix c. japonica and a cock Painted Quail Excalfactoria
chinensis.
The three species settled down well with no sign of aggression from
the larger Bobwhites. This I had anticipated due to the fact that the
parent Bobwhites lived in harmony with numerous Japanese and
Painted Quail in a larger aviary.
During the following nine months I observed the behaviour of the
four young Bobwhites and found that three behaviour patterns/postures

greenfood, tufts of grass, maggots, mealworms, etc., was given. It was
displayed to a larger extent when live food such as maggots or meal-

worms was given and to a lesser extent when greenfood was given.
When live food was given the bird postured, as described, over the
food (at times uttering a high pitched " rattling " call), sometimes pin-
ning the food with the beak to the ground before eating it. This pos-
ture is very much the same as displayed by Japanese Quail (Lambert
1970) except that Japanese Quail do not fan out their tails, and cock
Bobwhite Quail do not present live food to a hen as do cock Japanese
Quail.
rig. 2
Posture (2). I have described this posture as widely as possible as
it appears to cover several emotions, which are closely allied. For
example, if alterations were made to the layout of the aviary, say by
the addition of a log on the ground or if a handful of hay was given
for the Japanese Quail to roost in, the Bobwhite immediately ap-
proached the object of interest with necks stretched out, tails fanned
and legs straightened as if they are walking on tiptoe. The cock bird
usually erected its head feathers. This posture was usually accompanied
by a high pitched single call repeated several times by both sexes. The
approach of the bird to the object of interest was usually (though not
always) displayed in a state of nervous apprehension. Sometimes the
object of interest was inspected at once, at other times the bird circled
it several times with outstretched neck. When its curiosity was satis-
fied the object was accepted and no further interest was taken in it.
Posture (3). Until March of 1972 the four young Bobwhite Quail
had lived in harmony with each other and with the other species of
quail in the same aviary. On 17 March I observed mating between
one pair of Bobwhites (the mated hen was distinguishable from the
other hen by having a small white patch of feathers on the breast).
The following day I erected two nesting screens made of wire-netting
hoops supported by sticks at the entrance. These were filled with hay
and straw. The placing of these screens in the aviary immediately
released behaviour posture (2) in all four birds. After accepting both
screens, each bird burrowed into the straw. A littie later I noticed
that a nesting scrape had been made at the back of one of the nesting
screens. Both cock and hen birds indulged in sideways throwing using

small pieces of grass, straw and sticks.
Early in the morning of the following day (19 March) I found one
of the cock Bobwhites huddled in a corner of the aviary with minor
neck and back wounds. At this stage I was not at all sure of the cause
of the injuries and as they were not severe enough to warrant remov-
ing the bird from the aviary I decided to leave it where it was for
the time being. However, as I fed the birds in the large aviary I heard
a commotion coming from the small aviary. The injured cock was
being chased by both the hen with the white bib and the other cock.
Both birds were in their aggressive postures (as described). Every time
Fig. 3
the injured cock was cornered he was immediately pecked on the neck
and back and in its flight, it flew twice into the air.
The less dominant hen (i.e. the one without the white bib) took only
a minor part in the aggressive attack, being content with taking a quick
stab at the injured bird if it happened to come near. Deciding it was
time to interfere, I caught the injured bird and put it in a large cage.
During the attack no aggression was shown towards the Japanese or
Painted Quail. It seemed clear at this stage that the remaining cock
Bobwhite had gained its territorial domination over the other cock
and at the same time the white-bibbed hen gained her dominance
over the submissive cock.
During the following week the injured bird slowly recovered in the
cage and at times " crowed " repeatedly. The " crowing " call released
behaviour posture (2) in the cock and dominant hen in the nearby
small aviary. It was interesting to note that the dominant hen did not
try to gain dominance over the other hen.
A few days after the initial attack I caught the less dominant hen
and put her into the cage with the injured cock and his reactions were
not as I had anticipated. Instead of trying to gain dominance over the
hen, his reactions were of complete submission toward her--crouch-
ing low to the ground with closed eyes, then backing, still in a crouched

position, into her (this taking place nearly a week after the attack). The
hen responded with a few hard pecks without exhibiting the aggressive
posture, but keeping the cock confined to one corner of the cage. After
watching both birds for some time I decided it would be wiser to
return the hen to its aviary.
On 26 March (a week after the initial attack) I found the dominant
cock Bobwhite attacking the Japanese Quail. One bird was in a critical
state; its head was completely scalped and most of its back raw and
bleeding. The other hen was unharmed physically but seemed to be
in a state of shock. Both birds were removed from the aviary.
This latest act of aggression towards birds of another species was,
I felt, surprising as the Bobwhite Quail in the large aviary had mated
and nested but had not exhibited any aggressive behaviour towards
any other species.
Finally I would mention some simple experiments I carried out
with life size models of a cock Bobwhite Quail. These experiments are
in no way conclusive but they were interesting. Basically I was inter-
ested to find out whether or not the bold brown, black and white facial
markings of the cock bird were " recognised " and, if so, whether or
not aggression would be released against the models.

If all four models had been greeted by posture 2 then it could have
been assumed that the Bobwhites were only displaying their usual 66 cur-
iosity 55 behaviour toward an object of interest. But as the birds only
reacted fully to models a and b and only slightly to d and not at all to
c it can, I feel, be assumed that the bold head and facial markings were
recognised.
It was noted, however, that at no time was aggression shown towards
the models. I felt that this might have been due to the fact that al-
though (a) and (b) were recognised and received a distinct " curiosity "
reaction, it was either not strong enough to release aggression, or their
extreme nervousness dominated their aggression. However Dr. Colin
Harrison has pointed out in correspondence that the absence of aggres-

sion could be due to the failure of the models to show any change of
attitude or responses and that although (a) and (b) were sufficient
to arouse interest as a recognisable signal of the possible presence of
other Bobwhites, the failure of the models to do anything further
prevented greater arousal.

NOTES FROM THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDEN, NAPLES

The bird collection in the Giardino Zoologico di Napoli consists
of some 65 species and includes such rarities as Spix's Macaw, Banksian
Cockatoo and a young pair of Vulturine Parrots Psittrichas fulgidus.
There are 16 species of Loriinae and during 1974 the breeding results
included 25 parrots, exclusive of Budgerigars, among them two Golden
Gonures ( guarouba ) that were hand-reared because in previous years
the parents had killed their chicks. Red, Blue-streaked and Dusky
(fuscata) Lories and Ornate and Red-collared Lorikeets were also
bred. Roseate Cockatoos nested but no young were raised except for
one that was taken away and reared by hand.
The conures, like other seed- and fruit-eating parrots that are
hand-reared are given a mixture of finely ground toasted bread (one
part), one part of a proprietary cereal for infants, one part finely
grated apple, ^ part powdered milk, J part Dextropur (fruit sugar),
a small quantity of multi-mineral supplement and additional calcium.
This is given by means of a 5 cc syringe for the first three weeks and,
like the food given to lory and lorikeet chicks, it must be given warm,
at about body heat, being tested by the tongue. The milk is pre-
pared with water and the consistency of the whole mixture must,
of course, be liquid enough to pass through the syringe. The feeding
for the first day after hatching is done only once, the mixture being
then diluted with an equal part of warm water, but thereafter the
chick is fed every two hours throughout the 24 hours for at least
four days, changing then to three-hourly feeding. The food should
only be given when the crop is empty and after four weeks the chick
need not be fed for eight hours during the night period. After about
three weeks the diet is changed by the addition of ^ part peanut
butter and part sunflower seed kernels ground or chewed; also
some leaves of dandelion Taraxacum officinale finely ground or
chewed. Sufficient of the mixture to last for 24 hours can be prepared

at one time, but, of course, care must be taken to see that it does not
turn sour, so it needs to be kept cold. Sodium bicarbonate in water
is given if any digestive trouble is suspected.
Lories and lorikeets are fed on a mixture of a baby milk-based
food (containing no fat), the cereal as given to infants, Dextropur
fruit sugar, finely grated apple and, if thought necessary, a little
meat extract. The milk is prepared as directed on the packet--75 cc
of water to 8 grams of powder (Nativa is the product used) and to
this is added 3 grams of cereal and 3 of Dextropur. One drop of
multivitamin (Protovit from Roche is used) per week is given and
the general regimen follows that given for the conures. As with all
such hand-reared chicks, the bird must be kept very clean and the
facial area washed after each meal. A teaspoon bent so as to form a
narrow funnel is used and the chicks are fed alternately on each
side of the bill so as to prevent any risk of deformity. The mixture
for lories and lorikeets should be of the consistency of cream and,
of course, must be given warm. The milk food contains mineral
additives.
The chicks are kept in a box having towelling on the floor, but
wood shavings (not sawdust which can get into the eyes and cause
inflammation) can be used later on.
An electric lamp of 100 watts is hung above the box so as to give
a temperature of ioo* F. (37 0 G.) directly beneath it on the floor
level. The heat is gradually reduced as the feathers begin to develop
and this can be done by fixing the lamp a little further av/ay.
Naturally this and the general treatment, like the feeding, needs to
be done with some intelligent latitude, for each chick is different as
regards its needs and its development. Naturally the light bulb must
be shaded in some way so that the chicks are not in a bright light.
It was found that the conures were most comfortable during the
early days in a temperature of no more than 85*~90 0 F.

roseus and 63 Chilean Flamingos P.r. chilensis and on a small penin-
sula of about 25 square metres the birds have built 22 mud nests.
Adjoining the nesting area is a grass covered slope and in this enclo-
sure the flamingos stay all the year round. Only when the temperature
falls to 2-3 0 C. below zero so that the lake water and the food become
frozen are the birds driven into a small house nearby which is heated
and has a small pond. The cold periods are generally short and the
flamingos do not usually have to stay for long in the house. Before
the completion of this house in April 1972 the flamingos were taken
into winter quarters and did not return to the lake until the end of
March or early April which caused a disturbance of the courtship
which takes place from the end of March onwards and so the breeding
results were not what they could have been. This zoo was the first in
Germany to breed the European Flamingo in the year 1963 and the
Chilean in 1965, but more numerous and regular breedings took place
here from 1972 onwards by which time the new winter quarters were
finished and the birds did not have the disturbance of being caught
and transported. So from 1963 until 1971 only 13 chicks of the Euro-
pean Flamingo were hatched of which two died, whereas from 1972-
74 (three seasons) thirteen were raised successfully, and in the case of
the Chilean seven were hatched between 1965 and 1971 of which two
died, whereas in the three years from 1972 until 1974 twenty-five
were hatched and 19 reared. This seems to indicate that the greater
success is due to keeping the birds in the same place with a minimum
of disturbance the whole year round. Since two years ago thirteen
American or Rosy Flamingos P.r. ruber have been building their nests,
but have not as yet started to breed. In 1974 nine Andean Flamingos
Phoenicoparrus andinus which are living with six James's Phoenicopar-
rus jamesi built three nests and laid one egg in June, but it was
infertile. Ten Lesser Flamingos Phoeniconaias minor which are living
at the Bird House have not yet shown any courtship behaviour.

introduction in this region has been operating successfully for some
time, birds bred in zoological gardens being mostly used for the pur-
pose and, among others, the Berlin Zoo has supported this action.
In 1949 we received the first two European Eagle Owls since World
War II. They were put into an aviary measuring 6x3 metres and
3.20 metres high. The back wall is formed by rocks and the birds like
to sit on the ledges; natural branches are fixed into the sandy soil and
there is a pool of constantly running water. A nest box made of wood
is fixed on the wall, but the birds have never used it for nesting. The
birds were, in 1949, less than one year old, so we did not expect any
breeding until they were three, for although this species is fully
developed at one year, it does not usually breed until three years of
age. However, even then our owls showed no signs of breeding and so
in 1958 we started several experiments, getting a new female from
another zoo and in 1962 a second unsexed bird, but neither agreed
with our original birds and were returned. At last in 1963, when we
had almost given up hope, the larger of the two owls made a scrape on
the ground in one corner of the aviary. She laid two white and almost
round eggs and after 35 days on 7th and 8th May two chicks hatched,
so after 14 years breeding had started and it has continued each year
ever since. All clutches except for three have been of three eggs and
of all the 37 hatched only one was not reared, this being the fourth of
a brood in 1965 and it was destroyed because of suffering from serious
rickets. We consider that the successful rearing could be due to the
food. White mice are supplied, 10 to 15 per day for three chicks and
two white rats for the parents. Twenty-two of the European Eagle Owls
bred here have been given to German institutions for the conservation
of wild life and the remaining 14 have been sent to zoological gardens.

cases have we had breeding results in mixed collections due to the fact
that the birds disturb each other as soon as one pair starts nest-building.
Since 1962, we have kept a pair of Common Caracaras living together
with approximately 12 vultures (Aegypius monachus, Gyps fulvus,
Gyps bengalensis, Pseudogyps africanus) in a large aviary measuring
15.60 x 9.40 x 5.80 metres. For the first time, the Caracaras bred in
1971 and raised one young, which was separated from the parents in
1974. In April 1975, mating behaviour was again observed. As soon as
we saw the birds collecting nesting material and carrying it into a
hollow, about 5 metres high in the back wall made of sand stone, the
vultures became interested in this nesting place, so we fixed some logs
in front of the cavern, allowing the small Caracaras to enter but
keeping the vultures out. By this method, the nest was protected, the
single egg incubated by both parents, and the young hatched in the
beginning of May. It left the nest for the first time on 25th June. When
we discovered it outside the hollow, it was the same size as its parents
but was much paler in colour, It will be separated from the adults at
the end of the year.

The zoo of Budapest opened on 9th August 1866 when 500 animal
species were exhibited there. Between 1907 and 1912 there was some
reconstruction and broadly speaking, except for a few large buildings
of recent years, it has much the same general lay-out as when it
opened. The zoo developed well between the two wars, but the awfui
devastation of the second destroyed nearly everything: three quarters
of the buildings lay in ruins, more than 90% of the livestock perished
and only four birds were left alive. The restoration began very slowly,
but by degrees the collection increased from presents, collecting,
and after a while from the purchase and exchange of specimens.
At present the number of birds is about 900-1,000 and the number
of species about 170-180 of which more than half are palaearctic
species. Each year some eggs or young are collected from the wild--
storks, herons, waterfowl, Great Bustards and owls are collected
and we rear Black-tailed Godwit Limosa limosa , Redshank Tringa
totanus , Avocet Recurvirostra avosetta , Kentish Plover Charadrius
alexandrinus , Stone Curlew Burhinus oedicnemus and White-winged
Black Tern Chlidonias leucopterus. On two artificial lakes are ex-
hibited all the native nesting ducks--Teal, Gadwall, Red-crested
Pochard, Ferruginous Duck, Pochard and Golden-eye. A number
of the usually kept species of geese are in the collection while the
pheasant aviaries contain some 14 species, notably the Great Argus

Argusianus argus. In the aviaries for birds of prey we have Lesser
Spotted Eagle Aquila pomarina, Imperial A. heliaca and Tawny A.
rapax, the Goshawk Accipiter gentilis 3 Andean Condor Vultur gryphus,
Griffon Vulture Gyps fulvus and Bearded Vulture Gypaetus barbatus.
Six species of European owl are kept and three of them nested during
1974. Some fifty species laid eggs during 1974, notably Chilean
Flamingo, Night Heron, Spoonbill, Marabou Stork, Black Kite, Sparrow
Hawk, Tawny Eagle, Griffon Vulture, Great Bustard and Sulphur-
crested Cockatoo, while Rheas, Sacred Ibises and a number of water-
fowl and pheasants were among the birds reared.
Among the rarer of the native birds in the collection are Great
White Egrets Egretta alba , Spoonbill Plaialea leucorodia and Black
Storks Ciconia nigra and of foreign birds the Boat-billed Heron
Cockle anus cochlearius, Shoebill Balaeniceps rex Scarlet Ibises, a Bald
Eagle Haliaetus leucocephalus and Crowned Pigeons Goura cristata.
Ostriches, Emus, Rheas ( americana) and Casuarius casuarius have a
separate house with large paddocks while Great Bustards, Marabou
Storks, Crowned, Stanley and Demoiselle Cranes live nearby. The
Bird House contains a wide variety of Psittacidae as well as toucans,
touracos, various insectivorous birds and finches.
I would like to express my thanks to Dr. Akos Szederjei, General
Director, and to Mr. Paul Modlinger, Manager, for their help in the

This is a collection of first class photographs in colour of a wide
range of birds and, as stated in the Introduction, the choice of subjects
has been governed by the photographs of acceptable quality taken by
the author, mostly in the wild. It is aptly described as an appetiser for
those visiting the tropics, for a lot of the species depicted may be seen
without too much difficulty by those visiting their various habitats. In
addition to the photographs there is information contained in the
lengthy captions and in articles on broadly based groups of birds. There
is a map on Mercator's projection divided and lettered so that the
distribution of each species is readily found by reference to the index.
A chapter of particular interest to the photographer gives information
and advice on photographing birds and, coming as it does from one
of the foremost men in this field (and a perfectionist withal) its value
is self evident. There is also a list of recommended reading and
altogether this book is to be highly commended, not least in these
inflationary days for its very reasonable price. An excellent choice to
give as a present.

The Limited Relevance of Subspecies to Aviculture
Bernard Sayers (Avicultural Magazine, 81, 1975, pp. 117-118) raises a
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.989778105263158" page_id="56381502"  page_num="175" year="" vol="">
number of points which deserve comment in his letter on the relevance of
subspecies to aviculture. I wholeheartedly agree that subspecies are only worthy
of naming when they differ both appreciably and consistently from each other,
and that there is little point in naming stages along a dine of continuous
variation. However, I disagree with his contention that the Strigidae and
Psittacidae abound in examples of species capriciously divided into myriads of
subspecies, which to his view are unjustified and impractical.
Mr. Sayers states that it would be difficult to suggest a more obvious case of
excessive division of subspecies than that of the Rainbow Lorikeet Trichoglossus
haematodus. In an earlier letter I argued that many of the subspecies of this
species can only be recognised by comparison with adequate museum material,
and that a proportion of specimens can then only be recognised by reference
to the locality where they were collected (Avicultural Magazine, 81, 1975,
p. 59). However, I was not suggesting that these subspecies are unworthy of
recognition. Gain (Ibis, 97, 1955, pp. 432-479) details the characters of the
21 subspecies he recognises and describes how they are all appreciably and
consistently different. The only case of clinal variation where this author
recognises more than one form is with the T. h. moluccanus and T. h. septen-
trionalis pair, where he gives these names to each extreme of a cline.

<bodyText confidence="0.998610721311476" page_id="56381503"  page_num="176" year="" vol="">
Mr. Sayers' suggestions for a revised classification are not in accordance with
the criteria for which he argues. Taking just one example, T. h. deplanchii is
listed as a subspecies of doubtful status, presumably because it appears to fit in
with the cline of increasing size from north to south that is apparent in the
similar T. h. massena. However, Cain {loc. cit., p. 446) states: "many birds of
the Loyalty Islands and New Caledonia show some distinctness (Mayr 1940). In
deplanchii this takes the form of a rather faint powdering of light blue over
the head. This is the only character which does not fit the cline ..."
Thus deplanchii is appreciably and fairly consistently different from the other
subspecies. However, it is far from distinctive and reference to numerous speci-
mens in good light is necessary to be sure of the difference. The same applies to
all of the other forms beneath the " doubtful " heading (except perhaps
septentrionalis as mentioned above). It is essential to examine the extensive
series from New Guinea populations in the American Museum of Natural
History (as Cain did) to be sure of this for all subspecies, as material for these
in British museums is insufficient.
When taxonomists speak of two forms as being " consistently different ", they
generally mean that there is little or no overlap of the characters concerned
for birds in " taxonomic condition." Birds in " taxonomic condition " would
normally be regarded as adults in clean, unworn plumage, and for some species
might be only of one sex at one season. In those subspecies of T. haematodus
which are distinguished by only small differences, the majority of specimens
in a museum tray may be of little value for taxonomic comparisons.
Even given a fresh-plumaged, bright-eyed captive adult of T. haematodus it
could be difficult to assign it to a particular subspecies. It may be an abnormal
individual showing characters of a different form, or it may have acquired
abnormality in size or coloration through ill treatment during the early stages
of captivity. It might anyway come from one of the narrow zones of hybridisa-
tion where the ranges of two subspecies meet. Furthermore, it is alone and a
series of more or less randomly collected specimens from the same place would
probably be necessary for adequate identification of the more similar subspecies.
Knowledge of the locality from which it originated would at least allow an
informed guess as to its identity. Subspecies are defined as " geographically
defined aggregates of local populations which differ taxonomically from other
such divisions of a species." It has thus become standard practice for museum
curators to pigeon-hole specimens that are not in " taxonomic condition " (of
non-migratory forms) under subspecies according to their localities of origin.
This is not absurd as Mr. Sayers suggests, because any study of these unidenti-
fied birds is likely to be simplified by having them alongside the forms they
probably represent.
This is no place in which to indulge in lengthy discussion of the limitations
of the superspecies concept, for which readers are referred to Mayr (Ibis, 10 i,
1959, PP- 293-302). However, it is perhaps worthwhile to stress that it is the
subjective opinions of systematists that decide how big a difference is necessary
for subspecies to be recognised, and accordingly it may be pertinent to note
that the concept has only limited value in the study of bird evolution. Modern
students of evolutionary biology have to regard subspecies as a way of ordering
material for study, not the end of the study as it was for the Victorian
systematists.
The present classification of T. haematodus is based on the arrangement of
Peters (1937, Check-List of Birds of the World 3) with revisions by Cain
{loc. cit). These workers used the criteria for which Mr. Sayers argues, and I
haven't been able to find any obvious mistakes. It is true that some forms are
rather finely split, but the divisions are reasonable and do not merely separate
parts of dines. The subspecies groups listed by Cain may be sufficient for the
general reader who cannot tour museums examining all of the relevant material,
but that will be necessary for further useful revision of the more finely divided
subspecies.
Division of T. haematodus into three species as advocated by Mr. Sayers
seems a retrograde step. There is some evidence of gene flow or past gene flow
between parts of the groups of populations he lists as species (see Gain loc. cit),

and all the evidence suggests they would interbreed as freely if they met in the
wild as they do in captivity. Indeed, the real problem may be that of whether
T. ornatus and T. haematodus should be regarded as conspecific, rather than
that of subdividing haematodus ( cf . Gain, l.c., p. 436).
Mr. Sayers also raises a nomenclatural point by referring to " Trichoglossus
haematod (of Peters) 53 and later to T. haematodus Linnaeus named the
bird as Psittacus haematod , the name ending at the end of a line. Almost all
modem authors have amended it to haematodus on the reasonable assumption
that a typographical error was made.
Mr. Sayers contends that " if a local population of a species merits being
awarded subspecific status then this division is relevant to aviculture," It seems
to me that adherence to this axiom dictates that only birds of known geographi-
cal origin should be kept and bred together, which is certainly not the way
aviculture is usually practised, although perhaps an ideal. He goes on to add,
" If however, the subspecific status is aviculturally irrelevant, then that status
is unwarranted anyway. 53 This seems to me to be saying that a subspecies should
only be recognised if it is relevant to aviculture, which cannot be logically
correct---are the subspecies of T. haematodus unwarranted because aviculturists
do not obtain large series of birds from known parts of the range of the species?
Aviculturists are not the only people who study birds.
The standard list of North American birds (A.O.U., 1957, Check-List of
North American Birds) not Bent as cited by Mr. Sayers lists ten (not nine)
subspecies of Bubo virginianus, and at least another six occur in South and
Central America (Peters, 1940, Check-List of Birds of the World iv).
Similarly, Bubo bubo has around 20 subspecies (Vaurie, 1965, Birds of the
Palearctic Fauna, Non-Passeriformes). Both species have many striking
local subspecies as is apparent from a superficial search of any good museum
collection. Vaurie and the successive editors of the A.O.U list would un-
doubtedly have checked the distinctness of each of the forms they listed, and
satisfied themselves that they do differ appreciably and consistently. It is less
than fair to claim that such workers have " capriciously divided " such species
into " myriads of subspecies which are . . . unjustified and impracticable "
without first spending as many months checking specimens in the major
museums as they did, and then presenting evidence to prove the point.

Hatching Waterfowl Eggs by Incubator
Up to this season I have had no real success in my attempts to hatch the
eggs from my waterfowl in an incubator. Normally I use bantams as foster
mothers for ducks and allow the geese to hatch and rear their own young,
though occasionally when a bantam has deserted or been disturbed after sitting
for some three weeks, a few ducklings have hatched from the clutches finished
off in an incubator. This year for the first time three species of geese have had
their eggs hatched after the full incubation period in an incubator. The main
problem is thought to be that of obtaining the correct humidity and one has
read about keeping the water tray dry to start with and filling up after the first
two weeks. This year I kept the tray full of water from the start and in
addition I had a small container of water on the egg tray itself and a rag kept
in this was used to moisten the eggs with warm water immediately after cooling
and just before replacing the incubator lid. The eggs were turned five times
daily after the first 48 hours and cooled once a day. Much thought has been
given to the cooling process and, as is well known, both ducks and geese are
most careful about covering their clutch with down before leaving for the daily
feed--in fact I have knowledge of a number of cases where a duck has been
frightened off her eggs without the opportunity to cover them and she has
deserted the clutch immediately. It would appear therefore that a sudden

<bodyText confidence="0.985011833333333" page_id="56381505"  page_num="178" year="" vol="">
cooling of waterfowl eggs can be disastrous. The normal procedure that I
adopt and which works perfectly with bantam, guineafowl and pheasant eggs
is simply to remove the perspex lid of the incubator, replacing it after ten or
fifteen minutes cooling and after the turning of the eggs--the machine inciden-
tally is still-air Curfew. As it is housed in a stone-built outbuilding which is
always at a fairly low temperature, this method of cooling the eggs was quite
drastic, so I decided to emulate the goose itself, so to speak, by laying a piece
of heavy blanket over the eggs immediately the lid was removed and tucking
it in all round. This meant that not only much less cooling took place, but that
it took place more slowly and the results, though small in numbers were quite
dramatic. A young pair of Emperor Geese produced their first clutch of five
eggs and the morning after the fifth was laid the goose was off the nest and
looking very ill, so I suspect that she had been attacked by a rather aggressive
Pink-footed Goose which wanted the same nest site. She made no attempt to
return to the nest and in the evening the eggs were put into the incubator: two
were infertile and the other three all hatched within a couple of hours of each
other on the 24th day. They were fine strong goslings, have been reared in a
brooder and are now out on grass. My established pair of Bar-headed Geese
played the fool as usual, the goose laying eggs all over the place without making
a nest or going broody, so I rescued two eggs from the crows and, without much
hope, put them into the incubator where the one fertile egg hatched on the
appropriate date. The gosling was a bit feeble at first, but was reared success-
fully with the three Emperor and is now out of doors. A young pair of Barnacle
Geese produced three eggs and then ignored them. One disappeared but the
other two produced nice goslings in the incubator on 22nd June, so that from
nine eggs, all six fertile ones hatched and the goslings have so far survived, a
result that could hardly be better. The incubator temperature was set at 103* F.
and was checked each time the lid was removed and the variation was no more
than one degree.

As the supposed friend in the case incorrectly outlined in correspondence by
Mr. Barlass, perhaps you will be kind enough to allow me to defend myself since
he launched into his diatribe without having the courtesy to approach the
person he was attacking so as to ascertain whether his information was correct,
apparently accepting without question all that was told him by the third party.
Perhaps the following explanation will put right his neglect of the rules of
fairness and impartiality and his sweeping generalisations. Mr. Barlass states
that his ideas of breeding terms are generally acknowledged as being correct,
but that he does not know what happens in the case of eggs; however, he goes
on to label as a Shylock anyone who disagrees with his ruling on a matter he
says he does not know about. I belong to the minority (?) of breeders who
believe that on any occasions of either birds or eggs being loaned and the
venture is crowned with success, the parties share equally in cash or kind
whether they are friends or not.
I will now relate the most significant incidents so that my fellow members
can make an unbiased judgement. At the end of July 1974 the two young birds
in question were well feathered and were apparently both hens. The bringer of
the eggs was very pleased since he had two or three odd males of that species
and he said he supposed he would have to let me have one of them cheap
" to go with yours 55 . I declined because I do not like the Yellow-bellied and
said that I would have something else to the value. In early August one of the
six Pennant's in the box died, apparently smothered, so I did not rear six as

stated by Mr. Barlass--perhaps I would have done so had I not accepted the
additional two eggs. At the end of August, on the occasion a visit from the
bringer of the eggs I asked what he wanted to do about the bird I considered
mine and he said he had been advised by his friends that he was under no
obligation to give me anything. We were friends and as such we should do
these things without thought of repayment or sharing and he would do the
same for me. He did offer a present of some seed in gratitude, but I pointed out
that this was a great change from the previous offer of a cheap mate to go with
one of the two young that I had reared and having reached this impasse we
agreed to continue negotiations. The next offer was a 1974 Pennant's Parrakeet,
but this I felt not to be fair since Yellow-bellied were worth #500-600 each
and Pennant's #50. The next offer was a cock Crimson-winged (value #120
which, I believe, had killed its mate and this was refused.
The two young birds were collected early in September and I had no hesita-
tion in letting them go since I felt sure that some reasonable settlement would
be made and shortly afterwards the offer of a pair of young Yellow Rosellas
P. flaveolus (value approximately #300-350) was made and accepted, but
nothing came of it because the birds were not reared and so we returned to
"stalemate". As we were both members of the Parrot Society I asked that the
matter be put to the council or any three members for arbitration, but this was
refused. Towards the end of 1974 I asked my friend the price of a pair of King
Parrakeets Alisterus scapularis (value #500) giving him the opportunity to
deduct a reasonable amount in settlement of the dispute, but I was told they
were not for sale, though they were advertised shortly afterwards and no further
offer was made to me.
I regret that matters have reached this stage, for I do not wish to fall out
over the birds. At no stage did I demand anything, but if I had been the type
of person Mr. Barlass suggests I am, then one of the young birds would still be
in my aviaries. If it were not for my birds hatching the two eggs and rearing
the young, my friend would have had an expensive omelette instead of two
birds that he would otherwise have found virtually impossible to obtain, whereas
I appear to be the loser all round.

May I make a reply to the ill-mannered and ill-founded letter written by
Mr. J. C. Barlass and published in the April-June number?
It is ill-mannered since it was sent for publication without first allowing the
other side the opportunity to put his case. Added to this is the fact that the egg
owner had been showing a copy of the letter to other members several weeks
prior to its publication--a matter of extremely bad taste.
It is ill-founded in that, in the opinion of myself and of my friends, it is not
" generally acknowledged " that the first chick goes to the owner of the aviary
in which it was reared; this matter is generally agreed on beforehand. It would
be very unfair for someone to loan a proved breeding hen, for example, to mate
with an untried cock and for the owner of the cock to take the first, and
perhaps only chick just because they bred in his aviary. The writer obviously
wrote the letter " off the top of his head; I invite him to check it over again
and I also suggest that the egg owner also studies it carefully. If, as the writer
states, it is acknowledged that the first chick goes to the owner of the aviary
in which it was reared, in this case&apos; the hatcher should have one chick since
the chicks were reared in his aviary although the eggs were not laid on his
premises. Later the writer says that in his view (although he does not know
what happens in the case of eggs) all the chicks should belong to the owner of
the aviary from which they came. The chicks did in fact come, not from his
friend's, but from the hatcher's aviary, for only the eggs emanated from his

Longevity of a Barbary Dove
A hen Barbary Dove kept by me in a small aviary has recently died at the
age of 17 years 15 days. She had always been paired to her brother and they
reared young successfully until about 1965 in which year the chicks died at
about four weeks. Between then and 1972 the bird continued to lay, but latterly
the eggs were very thin shelled and she showed little interest in them.

Black Aphides as Food for Birds
I was interested to see the enquiry about black aphids (or aphides) in the
Magazine. My son breeds some common pheasants for his shoot and last year
we found that the chicks and their foster hens relished the black aphids infesting
the creeping thistle in the fields. I do not know the name of this aphis nor
whether it is the same as the " Black Army " of the broad bean.

EXPERIENCES WITH FAIRY WRENS

By Kerry A. Muller (Curator of Birds, Taronga Zoo)
Australia is renowned for its colourful variety of birdlife and being
isolated geographically from the other continents, many bird species
have evolved to fill the numerous ecological niches there. Over 60% of
the over 700 bird species recorded in Australia are endemic.
Although some Australian bird species are familiar to overseas
aviculturists and ornithologists, particularly various parrots, finches and
waterfowl, the majority are virtually unknown and seldom, if ever, seen
outside Australia. Among these are a group of the most beautiful of
all birds, the fairy wrens in the genus Malurus.
There are 14 species of fairy wrens (depending on which authors
taxonomy one prefers, McGill, 1970) : they are all endemic to Aus-
tralia except for one isolated species in New Guinea, and are one of
the most characteristic genera of birds, being found throughout the con-
tinent. They live in many habitats, being found in arid deserts, mallee,
forests, coastal heath and marshes and they are absent onlv from the
high mountains and the dense rain forests.
Each Malurus species is restricted to a particular habitat and an
experienced Australian birdwatcher can predict the presence of a
particular species by locating areas of vegetation that suit its require-
ments. They are sedentary and territorial, and established pairs do not
leave their areas unless the habitat has been disturbed.
Fairy wrens live in family flocks that vary from a pair to eight or
10 individuals. These flocks consist of a dominant breeding male and
female, often accompanied by the young of one or more broods raised
during the season. Often supernumerary adult males accompany the
flock and are subservient in the social hierarchy to the breeding male.
These retain their eclipse plumages longer than the breeding male and
often closely resemble the female in appearance. This gives the observer
the false impression of one male accompanied by several females. In
fact, studies by Rowley (1965) on the Superb Blue Wren revealed that

the adult breeding females are very territorial and will not allow
another female in their area. All young females raised during the year
are driven from the territory at the onset of the next breeding season,
while the young males may be tolerated.
Despite the great differences in habitat preferences among the
various Malurus species, all require some form of dense, low vegeta-
tion for nesting, roosting and concealment, with open areas nearby for
food-foraging. They feed primarily on small insects and arachnids,
and occasional seeds gathered on or near the ground. They are particu-
larly fond of termites which may form up to 80% of the diet of some
species.
Some species appear not to require surface water in their diet, all
their moisture requirements being contained in their food; accordingly,
some may be found in very arid areas far from any surface water.
This is in marked contrast to most other desert bird species, which
travel great distances to find water.
Taxonomically the Malurus species are of great interest. They form
several distinct groups, on a superspecies level, that are not recog-
nized in current taxonomy. Normally the species within such a group
are allopatric, although they are often sympatric with species in other
superspecies groups (refer to maps). Within the superspecies groups
there is no evidence of hybridization in the few areas where their
ranges overlap.
Species fall into the following natural groups :

My experiences with the Turquoise Wren and Black-backed Wren
in the field have shown that they live in similar habitats and are
indistinguishable in behaviour. In my opinion they should be
regarded as related subspecies. The Superb Blue Wren and Splendid
Blue Wren occupy different habitats to M. callainus and M.
melanotis 3 and behave as good species.

any of the other species groups. It is also bi-coloured, but differs
markedly in size and in the female plumage of some subspecies.

This species differs markedly in size, appearance and habitat from
all the other Malurus species. It is somewhat similar to Todopsis
wallacii from New Guinea and possibly represents a vestigial stock
previously common to both Australia and New Guinea.
Although all the fairy wrens are highly attractive, they are seldom
seen in collections outside Australia. The only species at all familiar to
aviculturists is the Superb, or Common Blue Wren. This was first
recorded as captive-bred by R. Phillipps in London, in 1902. It was
bred in America in 1961 in the Boehm collection in New Jersey, and
in Europe in 1973 in the Frankfurt Zoo.
Aviculturists in Australia have raised several species of fairy wrens,
but their successes are poorly documented. All are protected by law,
and most aviculturists who keep them do not have permits, so little
news is circulated of the achievements.
An article in Australian aviculture (August, 1950) states:
" Firstly the Blue Wren, Malurus cyaneus has been kept for a number
of years and has been bred in captivity by some dozen members at
least, the first recording coming from Mr. S. Harvey. The next bird
to receive attention was the Purple-backed Malurus assimilis, and was
taken in 1947, to be bred shortly after by Mr. Wuttke, and since by
several other members. Next came the White-winged Malurus leu-
copterus, and again this bird bred shortly after for Mr. F. Wilford
with at least two other members having achieved this distinction since
1948. One point while on this species is that while no difficulty is
experienced with other species coming into full colour, only two male
White-winged have ever attained full colour in captivity. At this stage
all species occurring near Adelaide had been handled and some time
elapsed before specimens of the Black-backed Wren Malurus melanotis
were taken north of Adelaide. Firstly, three birds were obtained but
were lost after being in captivity for some months without reaching the
breeding season. This was followed by the capture of a single pair at
the beginning of the breeding season, and these birds went right ahead
nesting twice for Mr. A. Phillips after only being in captivity for a
few months."

The Splendid Wren has been raised on a number of occasions in
Western Australia (Pepper, 1974). At least two aviculturists are cur-
rently raising Variegated Wrens and Black-backed Wrens.
In 1970 a project was initiated at the Taronga Zoo to study the
captive management, ethology, moult sequence and taxonomic inter-
relationships of the fairy wrens.
The Superb Blue Wren is a resident breeding species in the zoo
grounds, and no particular effort has been made to breed this species
in captivity.
A total of seven Malurus species are now represented in the Taronga
Zoo collection. These were collected (with necessary permits) on
several expeditions.
In 1973 two White-winged Wrens and one Red-backed Wren were
raised. I believe these represent first records for a zoo, and the Red-
backed Wren may be a first captive-breeding record.
Most fairy wrens are not particularly difficult to capture in the
field, once they are located. Despite the bright coloration of the males,
they are adept at concealing themselves in the dense vegetation. Often
their calls can be heard long before they are observed.
Family parties are territorial and follow fixed routes and routines
of movement throughout the day. These patterns can be ascertained
by careful observation and, by strategically locating a mist-net at
ground level to intercept their movements, they can often be captured.
They are adept at escaping through very small apertures, and a 1 in.
mesh mist-net must be used to contain them. Some individuals can
even pass through this.
Following a period of trial and error, a holding box was devised to
meet their requirements in transport and temporary housing. This is
made of very light plywood and measures 8 in. high, 2 ft. wide and 3 ft.
deep. The front is covered with plastic flyscreen, with a cloth sleeve
sewn in for access. Wrens are quite capable of escaping through stan-
dard doors and may injure themselves on wire.
Before placing them in the box, a few branches of dense shrub are
put inside. This provides a place to hide, ensuring security, and absorbs
shock when travelling. Without such cover the birds batter themselves
against the front of the box trying to escape. Food is placed on the floor
of the crate in easy view of the birds. Live termites and mealworms are
offered initially, along with our standard soft-bill mixture. This con-
sists of golden pound cake, grated cheddar cheese and house-fly larvae.
A powdered vitamin-mineral mix is included in the diet.
Most fairy wrens feed readily under these conditions. They will not
feed while travelling but, like all very small insectivores, must feed
regularly to maintain their body weight. It is therefore advisable to
stop for 10 minutes in every hour to allow them to feed.
Upon their arrival at the zoo the birds are transferred to larger

quarters and checked for disease and parasites. We have found that
most species carry some strain of Coccidia, and antibiotics are adminis-
tered to overcome this. They are closely observed to ensure that they
feed well and adapt to captive conditions.
It is our practice to colour-band birds immediately after capture
with plastic finch bands, and details of location and relationship are
recorded. If members of more than one family group are transported
together they can be subsequently identified. Family groups are later
housed together and the individuals can be identified by the colour
sequence of the bands. They are contact species and pairs always roost
close together. The juveniles and eclipse-plumaged males often closely
resemble the adult female, and the breeding pair can often be identified
only by the actions of the adult male. Once the adult pair has been
identified, these are removed and housed separately.
Because of the strong territoriality of fairy wrens, only one adult
pair can be housed in an aviary. They are compatible with most other
birds, but some coloured males will attack other small birds with
similar coloration. Any young raised during the year can be left with
the parents until the onset of the next breeding season, but then they
must be promptly removed. In Sydney the breeding season usually
commences in August.
Perhaps the greatest problem in tne aviculture of fairy wrens lies
in providing an escape-proof aviary. They can squeeze through in-
credibly small holes, and invariably will do so if they do not feel
secure and "at home". This is particularly true of single birds. All
aviaries used for fairy wrens in Taronga Zoo are covered with f in.
mesh, with all cracks cemented. We have been most successful when
we provided a well-planted aviary with a landscape resembling the
natural habitat and with a minimum of competition from other birds.
As already stated the birds must have thick low bushes for nesting,
roosting and hiding, and more open areas for feeding. Mice must be
absolutely excluded for, as the birds nest near the ground and feed
on the ground, they are very vulnerable to predation.
The nest is a compact woven dome with a side entrance, located
in thick plant cover near the ground. It can seldom be observed
without disturbing the vegetation. Spiders' webs are a major building
component, and must be provided to achieve success.
Incubation is from 13-14 days, with only the female sitting. Three
eggs form an average clutch and the young leave the nest in 13-14
days. Often two or three clutches may be raised in one season, the
young of the older clutches assisting in feeding the younger ones.
The moult of male fairy wrens is directly dependent on sexual
activity. The breeding male of a family group retains his bright
coloration longer than subservient males, and may pass a year without
going into an eclipse moult. Some aviculturists have experienced diffi-

culty in inducing males to moult into breeding plumage, particularly
the White-winged and the Red-backed Wrens. This problem has not
occurred in Taronga Zoo, where reasonably natural surroundings are
provided.
In most species the changing length of daylight is important as a
stimulus to breeding, but in the White-winged Wrens the stimulant
is not necessarily phototrophic : this species, in common with many
other desert animals, seems to be stimulated to breed by prolonged
rainfall.
Properly exhibited, few birds are more beautiful or attractive than
fairy wrens. We hope that, with increased success, we shall be able
to make some new species available to responsible zoos in other parts
of the world.

AN AVIARY-BRED STRAIN OF THE GREEN AVADAVAT

Amandava formosa
By F. C. Barnicoat (Johannesburg, South Africa)
At a time when attention seems to be focused on establishing aviary-
bred strains of as many wild bird species as possible, of which the
practical step taken by the Foreign Bird Council last December in
inaugurating a scheme to encourage fanciers to establish breeding
strains of 17 specified species is the most tangible evidence, it has
occurred to me that news of prolonged breeding success with the
Green Avadavat in a South African aviary will be of general interest.
In any event, continual success with such an attractive and worthwhile
aviary bird as the Green Avadavat, a species not heavily documented
on the whole, deserves permanent record.
The success with Green Avadavats has been scored almost without
trying by Mr. H. Steyn, President of the Rand Avicultural Society.
He lives on a small fann in Roodepoort, some 15 miles west of
Johannesburg. Here with ideal aviaries in an attractive setting Mr.
Steyn has been pursuing his hobby for many years. He is really taken
up with foreign parrakeets and Australian finches, although his
interests in birds are very general and a wide variety of interesting
birds is always to be viewed in his aviaries. In front of one of his

long ranges of aviaries was built a large "escape" or "protection"
flight 8 ft. wide and running the full 65 ft. length of the range. The
height is only 6 ft. To prevent this flight from proving an entire
waste of aviary space it was attractively planted with shrubs--several
varieties of Cestrum, honeysuckle, hawthorns, etc., the latter having
subsequently proved particularly attractive to the Green Avadavats
for nesting sites. There is no shelter to this aviary whatever, and apart
from the protection of very limited overhead cover provided by some
green fibre-glass sheeting, the birds are fully exposed to the elements.
Of course the aspect of the aviary on a north-facing slope is favour-
able and the aviaries behind provide considerable protection. None
the less, during our highveld winters, temperatures frequently drop
to zero at night and that Green Avadavats have established them-
selves so successfully in these surroundings indicates that they can be
hardy.
Through the years Mr. Steyn has kept in this flight a few pairs of
birds that are interesting, but not of great value, mainly local birds.
As breeding is always a top priority with him he has kept the number
of birds low, which has paid dividends. For example he has recently
bred two of the lovely Violet-eared Waxbill in this flight, a breeding
all too seldom achieved even in this country. It was into this flight
that the original pair of Green Avadavats was liberated 8 years ago.
This pair bred five young in the first season and in each subsequent
year between five and nine have been reared to maturity. From time
to time some of the stock has been sold. The clamour for these birds
has been great, for it is an attractive bird and is here rare and seldom
imported. Over the past eight years Green Avadavats have usually
graced the local show bench, being exhibited not only by Mr. Steyn
but also by others who have obtained birds from him. Not surprisingly
those bred in captivity proved far hardier than the few freshly
imported ones available from time to time. Mr. Steyn has tried to
keep the number of pairs in the breeding aviary down to one or two.
This has been a dicey position as losses do occur from time to time,
but so far the breeder has been lucky and he considers this procedure
better than overcrowding. Detailed records have not been kept,
beyond that Green Avadavats have reared young for eight consecu-
tive years; probably to the seventh generation or nearly that.
An interesting fact is that no new blood has at any stage been
added and the present little flock is descended from the one original
pair. There has been no attempt at selective breeding, the birds being
allowed to choose their own mates. They have not deteriorated in
any way, however. Society members were recently able to compare
the latest generation with some newly imported specimens and they
appeared to be not only steadier, but slightly larger than the fresh
imports and equally well coloured. It is well known that feather

plucking among this species is frequently a problem. This has never
occurred among the aviary-bred birds, whose smooth plumage has
stood them in good stead on the show bench and made them very
attractive exhibits.
Feeding has also been simple. No live food of any kind was
used to supplement their diet, though doubtless in a flight of this
size the birds have been able to find a certain amount of aphides and
other insects for themselves. The only supplement food the Green
Avadavats have taken to is the moistened brown bread and "Pro
Nutro" pushed through the wire of the adjoining aviaries for the
parrakeets.
The Green Avadavats have always constructed their own nests
in the growing shrubs. These are described as rough, globular structures
of dry grass, with the entrance hole in the side. They are rather
larger than one would expect for the size of the bird and the only
other feature about the nest-building noted through the years is the
fondness for feathers to use as a lining. In South Africa the Green
Avadavat has proved to be a winter breeder for the most part. Per-
haps it is not so surprising that they usually come into breeding
condition at this season, because in India it would be summer during
those months.
As companions in their large flight the Green Avadavats have not
had many birds. There has always been one pair of doves, the species
being changed from time to time. On the ground a pair of quail
has bred well through the years. There has usually been a pair of
Violet-eared Waxbills with them, and at present there is also a pair
of Red-eared Waxbills. Obviously the Green Avadavats have been
fortunate in having practically no disturbance or competition for
food from other birds in their aviary and perhaps herein lies the
reason for Mr. Steyn's spectacular breeding success with them. None
the less this delightful bird has shown that, given suitable aviary
conditions, it can prove hardy and a reliable breeder.

Luscinia svecica cyanecula
By M. Barber (Ipswich, Suffolk)
In 1973 I was fortunate enough to obtain a young pair of White-
spotted Bluethroats. They were in immaculate condition, the cock
not yet in full spring colour however, and not until the spring of
1974 was I able to appreciate what a beautiful species they are. The
hen, although more drab looking, is equal to the cock in her own
right. I kept the pair together during the winter in a large flight
in the birdroom, heated to a temperature of 45-50&apos;*F and after a
week or so they had become very tame and would feed out of my
hand. During the winter months the pair became a little aggressive
(fig. 1) towards each other, so I parted them. Since they are rare
and difficult to obtain I took every precaution.
They kept in good health and looked very fit when I released them
into the flight in spring. The flight measures approximately 20 ft. x
10 ft. x 8 ft. and has various bushes of elder, privet and blackberry,
with a small pool sunk fairly deep into the ground leaving a bank
all round. Three or four inches of mud collected from nearby
marshes made up the bottom of the pool and only an inch or so
of water was present on top. Nettles and other wild plants grew in
the rest of the flight. I put manure and animal carcases into the
flight to attract flies and other insects. With the live food available
in addition to what I was supplying I thought there was a good
chance that the birds might breed; but this was not to be and as
the months drew on I knew my chances for 1974 had gone. During
the summer months the pair had not taken much notice of each
other; I was disappointed, but I still had the pair and 1975 was
on the way.
As the winter months approached I decided to leave the pair
out for as long as possible, and until the weather became really
bad I would not bring them in. The winter of 1974-1975 turned out
to be quite mild, and so I kept them out all through, feeding them
on a good softbill mixture plus plenty of mealworms. During February
and March I detected a marked change in the behaviour of the
pair; fights broke out and on one occasion I picked up cock and
hen locked in battle. A careful watch after this led me to believe
that the cock was trying to become dominant and was ready to breed.
I was happy with this as long as it didn't become reversed and
the hen take over. To ease the tension I opened all the further half
of my aviaries which covered an area of approximately 70 ft. x 18 ft. x
8 ft., and I think this did the trick, for there was less fighting and
the cock began to sing (fig. 2). At the end of March and through
April the cock's song became more vigorous and the hen would

answer with song, but only in short loud bursts. By the end of
April the blue on the cock's throat and chest seemed to darken to a
glossy vivid blue. Combined with the chestnut-coloured breast band
and the white spot it all looked quite striking, At this time I began
to witness some display but it was not sustained for long.
I think I should point out here something that applies to most small
softbills, and that is the need to know each bird individually, and to
know its temperament and character. When pairs are put together,
although some fighting will take place, provided that both birds are
evenly matched and can give as good as they take I believe this
aggression to be natural and part of the breeding procedure. I have
found with other species that if either cock or hen is dominant from
the start, this results in the death of one of them. I believe that if
the pair are to breed the following should take place. The cock should
make the first aggressive move and the hen retaliate, producing a
state of "stalemate". The cock will then use other tactics such as
song, food-offering, carrying of nest material and displays. This
occurred with my Bluethroats and with other softbills that I have
bred.
It was not until the end of April and beginning of May that I
first witnessed the full display when I came into the flight and saw
the cock and hen within a foot of each other. I had a few mealworms
with me, as I make a habit of taking something to them almost
every time that I enter the flight, and I threw a few on the ground.
The cock picked one up and kept dropping it in front of the hen;
she in turn accepted it, so I now had a good idea that breeding would
take place. During display the male draws himself up tall and thin
with tail raised and spread (figs. 3-4) to show all the colours that are
present including the chestnut and brown tail. In this posture the
cock moves around the hen swaying from side to side. The movements
seem to have a hypnotic effect on the hen who remains in one place.
Both birds seem to be in a trance, and although the hen may peck
at the ground she keeps watching her mate. The cock appears able
to open and close the white breast spot at will and sings as he displays;
he sings at other times as well. The song is difficult to describe,
although I have it on tape, but it is beautiful to hear and continues
until it is dark at night.
I discovered the nest on 6th May. The hen had built in a biscuit
tin on its side which rested on top of a five-gallon oil drum. It had
previously been used as a feeding place for other birds in the flight,
but I had not used it for about three years. By 9th May the nest had
been completed and the first egg was laid on the nth. A strange
thing happened, for she did not lay any more until the 17th. In the
meantime the first egg disappeared on the 14th. The second egg,
laid on 17th May, disappeared on the 18th; but from the 19th on-

wards to the 23rd she laid five more eggs and started incubating when
the last was laid.
During incubation the cock was seen to feed the hen on the nest.
At this period he sang for most of the day, and during the last hour
and a half before dark each evening sang almost continuously. On
the day the young hatched he stopped singing.
On 5th June two chicks hatched, one on the 6th and two on the
7th. For the first day or two the hen brooded the young and the cock
fed her on the nest while she in turn passed food on to the young.
While the young were in the nest I was supplying wax moth larvae,
flour moth larvae, moths, whiteworm, and mealworms of about J in.
at first, increasing in size as the young grew. The food available in
the flight included large numbers of aquatic insects, worms, beetles,
flies, aphids and probably a lot that I did not know about. All the
insects that I supplied were dusted with vitamin and calcium powder.
Both parents were very tame and would take food from my hand,
and I was lucky enough to be able to sit a few feet from the nest
without disturbing the parents and to see what was taking place. During
the period when the young still had their eyes closed, when the parents
alighted on the edge of the nest there was no movement from the
young until the parents made a low "chuck-chuck" sound. The young
immediately responded to this by raising their heads and on one
occasion while standing about four feet from the nest, I tried to imi-
tate this by pulling my tongue down from the roof of the mouth,
the young also responded.
The parents encouraged the young to pass faecal sacs by pecking
at the young birds' vents and on the first few days I noticed that
the parents swallowed these; but as the young became older the adults
carried the sacs away. The young had greyish down on head and
back, with underside bare; the inside of the mouth was orange and
the outside edges of the bill pale lemon colour, becoming whiter as
the young grew older.
On 18th June three young left the nest but the last two did not
leave until the 21st, making the nestling period one at 13, two at 14
and two at 17 days. On leaving the nest the plumage was an almost
blackish-brown, with very fine buff tick markings on back and chest,
and the underparts towards the vent buff-coloured; the legs were
greyish. Later the general colour appeared more brown. Their dark
colour on first leaving made it very difficult to see them on the
ground. By 25th June they had started to pick up mealworms them-
selves and by the 2 8-29th they were all picking up mealworms but the
father was still feeding them.
Before the young were fully independent the hen had started to
nest again, the cock taking over parental duties. While the hen was
rebuilding the same nest the young had nothing to do with her and

she did not attempt to feed them. By nth July the young were
self-supporting, and no aggression was being shown to them by either
parent.
The hen began rebuilding on the 24th June and laid the first egg
on the 27th. Only three eggs were laid this time and on the 15th
July two young hatched, the last egg being clear. One young one left
the nest on the 25th and the other on the 26th. It was interesting
to note that these left earlier, at n-12 days. The feeding procedure
was the same as for the earlier brood except that wax moth larvae
were not used, owing to the risk of destroying the whole culture. I
suspected during the first brood that the parents tended to split the
brood between them and feed only certain young. With only two
young in the second brood this was more apparent.
At the time of writing the first brood are through the moult and
appear to be two cocks and three hens. At no time have I seen aggres-
sive behaviour towards the young by the adults. I should point out that
I believe this to be due to the free availability of live food. I would
not advise anyone to take the same chances unless a large quantity
of live food is available; nine birds of the same species can be quite
a problem if the supply of such food becomes short.
As described, the White-spotted Bluethroat Luscinia svecica has been bred by
Mr. M. Barber and this is believed to be a first success. Will anyone knowing
of a previous breeding of this species in this country please inform the Secretary

We have raised young of the Northern Helmeted Gurassow for the
first time, the eggs because of their size (between 195 and 200 grms)
being incubated under domestic turkeys, for we had not a suitable
incubator at the time. The first egg, the only one of the clutch, was
laid on March 20th and there have been four clutches, some of two
eggs, laid between then and June 6th.
The incubation period was 30 days and the artificial nest was of
dried grass, fresh green grass being put around the eggs during the
last ten days of incubation. The mother laid sometimes in a basket
fixed some seven feet from the ground and some of her eggs were
laid from a branch under which we latterly fixed netting in the
hope of saving the egg, but so far no more have been laid. On the
29th day of incubation the eggs were transferred to an incubator and
hatching took place within 2 \ hours from the "pipping" of the shell.
After drying, the chicks were put into a brooder with heat lamps,
but as the outside temperature was around 8o* F., not much additional
heat was required. The floor was covered with wood shavings and

there were perches fixed. The food consisted of mealworms, chopped
egg yolk, papaya, banana, berries and lettuce plus some grit. For
the first days the chick was hand-fed with mealworms and egg yolk;
later the lettuce and fruit were eaten, but the mealworms were the
favourite. One of the later chicks was hatched with badly deformed
toes and this condition was apparently cured after five or six days of
treatment which consisted of making the chick use the perches as
much as possible, but there was a relapse and now the toes are crooked,
though the bird perches normally.
We obtained from a zoo in Venezuela a female of the rare rufous
phase of P. pauxi. This bird had been there for eight years and our
information was that the bird had not laid any eggs during that
time and there was some doubt about its sex, but only two days
after arrival in Tuxpan she laid an egg on the ground. She had been
put while at the zoo with a pair of Yellow-knobbed Gurassows Crux
daubentoni so we incubated the egg, but at the time of writing it
has not been tested for fertility. We do not know of any hybrids
between these two species having been bred. Using the work of
Delacour and Amadon 1973 as a guide we had already decided that
the rufous-phase bird was a female, though it is believed by people in
rural areas of Venezuela that there is the rufous phase among the
males of P. pauxi ; the local name is Camaguey. Our chicks during
the first few days had the head, neck, breast, back and wings of a
medium brown with blackish peppering on the head, breast and back.
The lower breast, belly and ventral region pale buff. Wing feathers
tipped blackish-brown, giving a barred effect; these flight feathers
are well developed at hatching. Bill pinkish with a light spot at the
tip of the maxilla and just beyond the nostrils what might appear
to be the formation of the helmet, a slightly raised area of greyish-
brown.
We introduced the rufous bird into the same aviary as our normal
P. pauxi were occupying and the male at once recognised her, ex-
tending his neck upwards to its entire length and calling to her. When
given some peanuts he took one in his bill and offered it to her,
calling to her and after several attempts she overcame her nervousness
and took the nut from his beak. The normal female, however, was
hostile to the newcomer and so we removed her and left the rufous
female with him.

These notes are written in view of the almost complete lack of any
information concerning this species in captivity. The only reference
I have been able to find in the avicultural magazine dates from
the 1930X when a single specimen figured in a list of birds brought
from Africa to England by Whitley. I must stress that my observations
have been made on the sole representative of the species with which
I have had any contact, a bird which has been in my possession for
about 18 months. Of necessity this bird is kept as something of a
pet, partly because a long stay in a pet shop before I bought it had
made it so used to human company that it failed to settle in an
aviary and partly because, in any case, it would not mix with the.
parrots and small finches which make up the bulk of my collection.
This is, therefore, a very individual view of an individual bird, but
I trust that it might inspire others with experience of this delightful
species to put pen to paper.
taxonomy
This is confused, partly, I suspect, because the bird differs in
many ways from the other East African barbets, making it difficult
to decide with which, if any, to classify it. Furthermore, some authori-
ties recognise more than one subspecies, while others distinguish
these as distinct species and still others only acknowledge one form.
Thus, the B.M. (Natural History) Catalogue distinguishes two species,
Smilorhis leucotis, and S. kilim ensis, while Peters retains the generic
name Smilorhis 3 but has five subspecies of S. leucotis , including S.
leucotis kenyae , kilim ensis, leucogrammicus and bocagei along with
the nominate race. Mackworth-Praed and Grant, Jackson and others
refer to Buccanodon leucotis and subspecies, while Grzimek prefers
Stactolaema leucotis,

In general, variations between the subspecies as regards plumage
are slight, and the description given for the nominate race in the B.M.
Catalogue will serve for all:
"General colour above light brown on the mantle, upper back, and
scapulars, the feathers edged with pale fawn-brown or buff; lower
back, rump and upper tail-coverts blackish, the sides of the lower
back white; wing - coverts and quills brown, blackish towards the
ends and on the outer web; tail feathers blackish-brown; head and
hind-neck black with glossy black shafts; a broad white band from

coverts white; sides of body blackish, some of the feathers white
edged; thighs brown; under wing-coverts and axillaries white; quills
dusky below, white along the inner web." The sexes are alike.
Of especial interest are the head feathers, which have a bristle-like
appearance, resembling a flattened-down version of the head feathers
of the Curl-crested Aracari.
The bird is about 15-17 cm. long, thick set, with a strong black
beak, which is surrounded by the characteristic bristles of the barbets.
The feet are black.
An excellent colour print of the species appears in Marshall,
where it is given the name Barbatula leucotis.

Observers of birds in the wild have recorded a variety of calls,
including trills and harsh "kaaa" sounds. My own specimen is, un-
fortunately usually silent. When held, it once emitted a very parrot-
like squark of protest, but this is the only call which I have definitely
traced to it, although the proximity of various conures does not
help in this respect. I suspect that, as the species is said to be very
sociable, it requires the stimulus of its own kind to vocalise.

Mainly fruit, with sweet grapes and cherries as favourites; however,
it needs some live food, as was evident by its rapid loss of condition
during a mealworm shortage. A few mealworms, limited maggots
(see below) and locusts are given regularly, along with anything of
interest caught in the garden. Spiders seem to be very popular, and
any flying insect which enters the cage is quickly caught, hornets
being an especial attraction. Meat, egg, cheese and the like are
refused, and soft-bill food is only taken when very thoroughly mixed
with fruit.
The rate of digestion seems to be very high, and droppings de-
posited during the day are often similar in appearance to the
original food. The first dropping in the morning is less granular in
appearance and is green and white.
The bird drinks a large amount for its size, and is very fond of
the nectar mixture which I give all my birds at regular intervals. (It
is also fond of our neighbour's bees which are attracted to the nectar!)

The bird is housed in a wire cage, i# m x 1 m x ij m, half of
which is shaded over against the sun. A Budgerigar nest box with
the hole enlarged serves for sleeping quarters. The bird is a "dry
nester" and a recent inspection revealed that the interior of the box
is perfectly clean. During the day much time is spent sitting in the
entrance of this box with just the beak sticking out. At these times
the bird is very alert, watching for insects, but it also retreats into
the box to rest at midday. I seldom see it resting on any of the perches,

although when it does it has a curious habit of drawing up one foot
almost to beak-level, keeping it well outside the feathers, in a
manner totally unlike that of any other roosting bird I have seen.
A rotten log has been quickly hollowed out to form a large
chamber, but the bird never rests in this and, indeed, scarcely
enters it, except for purposes of enlarging it. The hole seems to be
used to a certain extent as a larder. Before the introduction of the
log the bird was definitely in the habit of storing oddments of food
in corners of the cage, and it is often seen eyeing the inside of the
hole before emerging with a dead insect, but it is impossible to say
categorically that a larder is deliberately formed. However, if maggots
are provided they certainly seem to be kept in the log until they
emerge as "blue-bottles" (not by design--the bird refuses to eat them
once they have turned to chrysalids). Many of the flies are caught
and eaten, but some escape into the house, so maggots are provided
in moderation only.
Fresh branches are regularly provided as perches, in view of the
speed with which bark, leaves and side shoots are removed.
This bird is an enthusiastic bather. Unlike the other birds in my
collection it does not spend any appreciable time actually in the
water, thoroughly soaking the feathers by repeated splashings, but
it repeatedly dips into the bath, almost seeming to fly through it at
times. This still results in a complete soaking of the feathers. Spraying
is greatly appreciated.

In the wild these birds are more gregarious than many members
of the barbet family, and it has been reported that they sometimes
share nests. (Mackworth-Praed; Grzimek, quoting Moreau, in a
reference I have been unable to trace.)
There appears to be no record of captive breedings of this species,
although I understand that there are a fair number of specimens in
the country being kept for show purposes.
In the case of my own bird I am still hopeful of finding a mate,
or group of birds. Judging from the reports mentioned above, colony
breeding would seem most promising. However, I am afraid that
my bird may have become too 'humanised' for any success to be
likely. The plate is reproduced from the monograph of the gapiton-
idae (by permission of the Librarian, Cambridge University Library).

GEORGE A. SMITH-SPECIES OF PARROT IN CAPTIVITY
NOTES ON SOME SPECIES OF PARROT IN CAPTIVITY
By George A. Smith (Peterborough)
INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999248358974359" page_id="56381535"  page_num="200" year="" vol="">
Six years ago I could again start keeping birds. I could not keep,
as I would have much preferred, insectivorous or frugivorous species as
I have to see entirely after them myself and feeding and management
has to fit in with my sometimes very irregular working hours. The
aviaries I built are not heated and frost-sensitive species could not be
considered. My previous experience had soured me against breeding
regularly imported species, for it was always difficult to dispose of
the young to satisfactory people : far too often they finished up in
the pet trade because no one seemed to want them. Therefore, when
it came to it, my choice had to be parrots and I started with lutino
Cockatiels and New Zealand parrakeets.
My diary notes are too irregular to be able to give more than a
brief outline for some of the species I have kept and those parrots
whose aviaries are out of sight of the house have come in for very
little watching. However, the odd notes that I do have may have
some interest for fellow parrot enthusiasts. My single efficiency is
that I generally have managed to inspect the nest boxes daily; made
easy because they are hung on the outside of the flights and therefore
the incubation and fledging dates are reasonably accurate. I try,
usually with fair success, to indelibly mark each egg in the sequence
in which it is laid and all chicks are close-rung with sequentially
numbered rings.
Cooling of the eggs whilst they are being incubated does increase
the time that it takes for the chick to hatch; therefore winter laid
eggs, or eggs under indifferently sitting hens, take extra long to hatch.
However, as the incubation time cannot be reduced below a certain
minimum, the time that I have given is the shortest recorded interval
between the laying and the hatching of an egg. Generally this is the
time that it takes for the last laid eggs to hatch. Fledging times are
far less certain. The first time that one sees a chick out of the box
may not always be the first time that it has come out, for parrot
chicks invariably return to the nest for sanctuary, or to sleep, for
several days. Secondly, chicks reared by good parents, parents that
will eat bread and milk--a rich source of protein--and rearing their
young in the long days of summer, will have their chicks fledge much
earlier than if these circumstances do not apply.
In this series I shall try to present some general information upon
most of the species of parrot with which I am acquainted. To avoid
repetition, some species are dealt with at shorter length than others.

THE PILEATED PARRAKEET PUYpUVeicephalus SpUUUS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998357318181818" page_id="56381536"  page_num="201" year="" vol="">
The late Ken Knowles once tried to convince me that the Pileated
Parrakeet was by far the most interesting of all the Australian parrots
as an aviary bird. Greene (1883-87) was ecstatic about a hand-reared
one kept as a cage-bird. Having seen a few in aviaries where they
were always so wild that, at the best, you might just catch a glimpse
of one slipping into the shelter, I thought that they would be the
very last species of parrot for which I could ever whip up any en-
thusiasm for, above all else, I like my birds to be tame. Then in
late March 1973 I bought a small collection of Australian parrots
from a friend included with which was a pair of Pileated. The hen
was two years old and the male a bird of the previous year and still
in the green immature plumage.
They were a most pleasant surprise. Cautious they were, and still
are so that one has to study them from the inside of the house using
a pair of binoculars but they are almost continuously active and
consequently very entertaining and the almost ceaseless chatter of the
male is a wonderfully pleasing sound to have in one's own back garden.
They very much remind me of kakarikis, Cyanoramphus species, my
favourite parrots.
Unfortunately the first year the male was too subordinate to the
hen to pair successfully; she fed him, instead of vice versa , and
when she solicited for copulation, interested though he was, he
twiddled with pieces of twig or a stone and, when on the ground,
sometimes rolled right over onto his back. Consequently the two
clutches laid that year were sterile. I bred five chicks last year and
have six this.
Pileated seem fairly well established as aviary birds : I estimate that
in the U.K. there are between 50 and 80 pairs. As they breed well,
this does suggest an unusually high mortality rate. Those dead ones
examined by myself have largely suffered with verminous enteritis
(.Ascaridia and Capillaria ), from injury or from nephrosis associated
with degenerative changes in the liver. Fortunately, as yet, I have
neither lost parents or their young, but youngsters sold to others have
a 60% loss over the first year.
Description:
Pileated are the single representative of their genus and are con-
fined to the south-west corner of Australia. It had been suggested
(Cain 1955) that they and the Horned Parrakeet Eunymphicus cornutus
of New Caledonia are sufficiently alike to share the same genus, but
few people have adopted this suggestion.
Despite their length (35 cms--1 ft. 2 ins.) Pileated are small-bodied
birds (average weight of six was 103 grams (3J ozs.). They get their
English name from the pileum (the technical name for the upper half
of the head) being distinctively coloured; it is deep crimson, hence

the Australian name of Red-capped Parrot. The cheeks and rump
are a glossy yellowish-green; the chest and belly deep purple-blue;
the feathered part of the legs and the under tail-coverts are red;
the wings and tail are a rich, very glossy green.
The rather protuberant bill, which is somewhat pinched along its
sides, is not too unlike that of the Kea Nestor notabilis or the Slender-
billed Parrakeet Enicognathus leptorhynchus. (Curiously such a bill
is sometimes seen in Mealy and Common Rosellas Platycercus adscitus
and P. eximius where the upper mandible has suffered from some injury
making it grow straighter than usual.) The gap between the mandibles
is present in all the other broadtails but, because of the projecting
outline of the mandibles it is only in the Pileated that this gap is
taken well clear of the cheek feathers.
General behaviour.
Such a powerful bill has to have an occupation and the conse-
quence is that the perches and woodwork of the aviary housing
these parrakeets can suffer severely. A friend, wiser than I, has nailed
battens of wood to the inside of his flights for his Pileated to chew
and this has saved his main wood structure. When the perches and
wood are bitten it is not done completely haphazardly but is worked
at particular spots so that deep grooves get scooped out to form
notches that have all the appearance of being made with a drill laid
sideways on to the wood.
Most of their time they spend on the branches and wire. They
do descend to the floor but have hardly interfered with the grass,
come to that they ignore all green food except for garden peas and
dandelion seed heads. In contrast to all other broadtails they do not
pay much attention to the buds of branches but strip the bark and
leaves.
They bathe frequently, both in standing water and by rubbing
themselves on the wire or grass when it is raining. In feeding, the
foot is frequently used to steady food when standing on it or to
hold it to the face.
The word that most aptly describes the Pileated, as it does New
Zealand parrakeets, is bouncy, the male particularly so. He is seldom
still : walking along the perches in a self-important way, flying to-
and-fro, or scrambling through the twigs pausing to nibble or hang
from the wire. Very frequently the male chatters his di i i i i and, even
though it is the most pleasing of sounds, he must be the most con-
tinually noisy of all my parrots. This chatter is louder and slightly
more harsh than the chattering flock call of both sexes. The male
is seldom seen without having all the feathers of his pileum fully
erect so that he has the effect of wearing a diminutive crimson-
coloured guardsman's busby. The pileum is always erect during his
chattering. As he lands his wings are slightly drooped showing his

yellow-green rump and during each chatter he bows very slightly
forward and slowly raises the tail to an angle of about 45 *. This is
not a vertical up and down waggling suggested by certain authors
(e.g. Forshaw 1973) and it is not performed by the female; therefore
I think that it has no analogy whatsoever to the lateral tail swishing
of several broadtails. Like a fidgety child, a male appears unable to
keep still, but has to scratch his head, take hold of something in the
bill, fly off, as like as not to land to scratch his head as if he were
verminous, or to fiddle with his feet. Why the chatter, why the
continually raised crest, why the obvious almost unremitting nervous
excitement? Twice I have found the male sitting entirely oblivious of
me seemingly stunned, whereas a moment or two beforehand he
was his usually sprightly self. Like male domestic turkeys he very
probably was suffering from apoplexy from an elevated blood-
pressure. I believe that this chatter may have two functions, firstly
to demark his territory and secondly to stimulate the female into
reproduction, yet I have read somewhere, that several pairs can be
kept in the same aviary. Last year, as the chicks fledged, the male
severely attacked the female, desisting when the chicks went back
inside the nest hole and eventually I had to remove him. Was he
"defending" his chicks against the only available "enemy" ?
Some of the chattering notes given by both sexes are very like the
flocking calls of New Zealand parrakeets; so is the fidgeting, continual
movement. Likewise each flight is accompanied by a chattering call
as they land. Typical of Australian broadtails they never sit in physical
contact with each other, nor mutually preen. They have a particularly
cold marriage where affection is non-existent and only regurgitatory
feeding and feeding the young seem to bind them together.
Breeding
The chattering, wild singing and strutting of the male takes place
the year round except possibly when moulting. The hens are much
quieter and less outgoing and it is this, as much as the duller plumage,
which distinguishes them so easily. In normal circumstances a female
tends to move off to avoid the nearness of the male or she will lunge
at him with an open beak to make him fly off, but in the spring she
tends to hold her position while he cavorts in her vicinity. This being
such contrary behaviour for her he then, with much changing of
position, as if he were very uncertain of himself, and obvious daring,
regurgitates to feed her and then, very likely, he will speed off to
have another chattering fly around. I have yet to see my hen raise
her cap feathers. The male several times, in what appears to be an
ecstasy of feeling, has been seen to roll right over on to his back in
the grass.
Once the box is put up in early February the male shows as much
interest as the hen; yet I have not seen him enter the box until the

chicks are three-parts grown. He does sometimes chew away at the
entrance hole from time to time. My female always spends weeks
and weeks chewing away at the interior before she finally lays her
clutch of six, rather small, eggs (average weight of 18, as laid, was
7.2 grams). The sequence between the eggs is the usual two days
less a few hours. By the time that the first egg is laid there is a litter
several inches deep of wood shavings on the floor of the box. Egg
laying, for the past three years, has commenced on the 116th day
of the year, 137th and 130th (this year). Incubation, with my hen,
only starts as the clutch nears completion and the shortest incubation
period, recorded for several eggs, has been 19 days.
When they hatch, the chicks are typical broadtails with long, white,
rather thin down eventually replaced by a darker, grey down that
comes with the feather pins and there is the invariable white nape-
spot of broadtailed parrots. Their bills, as far as I can detect, look
rather as other broadtails; but the parents, with their elongated
bills appear to have some inefficiency in feeding them as the chicks,
from the earliest age, always have much food smeared over their
heads, something that I have not noticed with broadtails but which
is common with American parrots. The eyes first start to open at
about seven days; at approximately the same age the feet start to
colour and the tracts of pin feathers can be made out. Growth is
extremely rapid and the first chicks leave the nest when 33 days old.
Like all the parrots known to myself, they return to the nest to roost
for several days. When they fledge the chicks appear to be dispro-
portionately small but very soon feather up to adult size. They are
green with red vents and do not moult into the adult plumage until
the following year. I find them impossible to sex by colour; however,
young males have been heard 60 days after hatching to sing and
chatter and at about 90 days, when other chicks are relaxed, perhaps
preening themselves or sunning, the presumed young males will re-
gurgitate and feed the resting bird. Mr. Alfredo Marques tells me
that some he has bred have themselves bred the following year when
still in immature plumage; this is exceptional.
Perhaps because they nest so late and usually are moulting heavily
by the time that the chicks fledge they appear to be able to raise
only a single nest. I know of no exceptions to them being single-
brooded, unless the first brood is lost.
the splendid grass parrakeet Neophema splendida
The Splendid, like the Turquoisine Grass Parrakeet N. pulchella is
one of the species listed by the I.U.C.N. as being in danger of ex-
tinction. Fortunately both species are very well established in European
aviaries, as they appear to be no more difficult to breed than is the
Budgerigar. So common is the Splendid that there may be two or

three thousand, perhaps even more, in the U.K. in late July of each
year. Unfortunately many carry mycoplasma and the stress of moult,
the weather, draughts and damp lower their resistance to this micro-
organism. So that with mycoplasmosis ("contagious conjunctivitis"),
other diseases, intestinal worms and injuries, these high numbers are
cropped right down to perhaps 250 pairs by the beginning of the
breeding season. Consequently they are never common enough to
be caged as pets or much exhibited at bird shows.
A curious feature is that very many are so verminous with feather
mites that the underside vanes of the wing feathers are frequently
quite silvery-white from their nits (eggs).
Turquoisines and Splendids are said to be "very much alike" and
"closely related" (Macdonald, 1973). Behaviourally Splendids (is this
why they are so vulnerable to introduced predators, including man?)
appear to be naturally confiding whereas Turquosines strike me as
being extremely cautious. I believe, from my observations, that the
courtship display of these two species is different; but cannot say so
with certainty as my Turquoisines are completely out of sight of the
house and are too wild for close observation. Hybrids between closely
related species of bird are generally fertile. The fact that the several
(50+) hybrid offspring of this mating that I have investigated were
infertile, even in the male sex, does suggest that these two species
have probably diverged several millions of years ago (Prager &amp;
Wilson, 1975).
I have bred both normal and blue (actually to me they are sea-
green, for the yellow pigments are not actually suppressed as in blue
Budgerigars or Ringnecks) Splendids. However, as my aviaries are
not suitable to keep them during the winter months I have reluctantly
given up keeping them.
Description
This is the Scarlet-chested Parrot of the RAOU and is the size of
the Budgerigar (the wild Budgerigar and not the hypothyroidic,
caponized-looking show monstrosity) and weighs about 36 grams
(average of ten individuals). Both the sexes have grass-green backs,
tails and wings but their particular glory is that the male has a
wonderfully, almost iridescent blue head (the hen only has her face
blue) and the lesser wing-coverts are also blue. The amount of red
(surely not scarlet?) on the chest of the male is very variable : selection
among "fanciers" has increased the red so much that in some indi-
viduals it practically covers the entire chest and abdomen. Likewise
selection for brightly coloured "thighs", which are of a red-orange
shade, coupled with the selection for red bellies has given most
spectacularly beautiful birds. As the colour of the thighs is not
sexually determined, hens show the same brightly coloured thighs as
males.

General behaviour
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996412704545454" page_id="56381541"  page_num="206" year="" vol="">
It is odd that Immelmann (1968) should have credited grass parra-
keets with great climbing ability for they are extremely terrestrial
have feeble little bills and probably obtain very little, if any, of their
food from bushes and trees. They will use the bill to scale netting
but they generally hop or walk from twig to twig more like passerines
than parrots which, as a group, continually use the bill as a third foot.
For the size of the bird they eat large quantities of green food and
my aviary flights have to be returfed annually for, like Port Lincoln
Parrakeets ( q.v.), they chew stalks of herbaceous plants to extract
much, if not all, of their water requirement in the protein-rich juices
which they squeeze from the plant, and this chewing kills the grasses.
Mine may well be exceptional, but I cannot get them to eat any form
of berry, though they love apple and bread and milk.
They are very pronounced sun-bathers; when so doing they droop
the wings, flare the tail and puff the body feathers and appear to be
almost in a trance. They also bathe frequently and foliage-bathe; but
I have not seen them rain-bathe. A very few odd individuals will
stand on green food to steady it; however the majority make no
feeding use of the foot whatsoever : there is an observation by Mats
Tel (Smith 1973) of a Splendid holding food up in a foot. Splendids
appear to be sociable although I have never kept more than a single
pair in each aviary to see if they would fight when breeding.
The voice is a very pleasant finch-like twitter. It is interesting that
Aymara and Lineolated Parrakeets Bolborhynchus aymara and B.
lineola 3 parrotlets {Forpus species), Madagascar Lovebirds Agapornis
cana and grass parrakeet Neophema species--all of which feed largely
from the ground on the shed seed of herbaceous plants--should have
approximately the same sounding twittering call-notes and the same
kind of finch-like twittering song in the male.
Breeding behaviour
Splendids appear to reach sexual maturity well before they are a
year old. I have had 100% fertility with five month old birds. Even
when courting, a pair never sit in close physical contact nor do they
mutually preen one another. A courting male will fly rapidly to and
fro, the wings making a fluttering noise, to perch near the hen with the
wings drooped--displaying their cerulean blue--then dropping from
the perch he will rapidly flutter off again. Sometimes as the male
approaches the female he will rapidly duck his head, fluff the body
feathers and flutter the wings rapidly : exactly the movements that
he would make were he bathing in standing water. During this
always very quick "dry bathing" movement he buzzes a grrrrr sound
which is best described as being very like the muffled buzzing of a
large fly caught in the web of a spider. These two displays may well
be directed more against rivals than particularly at the hen, for the

self-same fluttering to and fro is also seen under mildly stressful
circumstances as at the close approach of another male or when I
stand adjacent to the nest box and look directly into the flight. It
has not been noticed when the birds were not breeding. The dry-
bathing movement and its accompanying buzzing noise are also per-
formed at the entrance to the nest, commencing during courtship and
continuing until midway through the incubation period. It is also seen
when the malei is offered pieces of green food through the wire
which he is thwarted from approaching because of my too close
presence. As part of their courtship, and at no other time of the year,
except when feeding the hen and chicks, regurgitatory feeding takes
place.
A noticeable feature of some parrots when under some slight
nervous tension is to click the beak. They apparently produce this
chattering noise by "gnashing" the mandibles together. I have some-
times noticed a male Splendid sitting still, and I believe at the time
either unaware or unconcerned at my presence, chattering his bill
three times and then giving a low teeing noise : the resulting sound
sounded like tic tic tic spleeee.
Copulation is the invariable Old World parrot form where the
male steps right on to the back of the hen. It takes place from one
side only.
My hens usually take a little nesting material into the box but
how it gets into the box I do not know for, though I have watched
them very carefully I have not seen them tuck this nesting material
into the body feathers for transport. The eggs, which weigh about
4 grams (average of 22 = 3.96 g), take 19 days to hatch and are
laid at intervals of somewhat less than two days so that a clutch of
six takes about eight or nine days to complete. Only the female incu-
bates. The male occasionally feeds the hen by going directly into
the box, but far more usually calls her to the entrance and feeds her
there as she protrudes her head. The chicks have long white down
and slightly pink bills and develop the usual white nape-spot of
broadtailed parrots when the darker down forms about a week later.
Usually the chicks are closely brooded for ten days or so by which
time they are three-quarters their final weight and thickly covered
with pin feathers. As they progress they climb up to the entrance
hole to twitter their food-soliciting call and bob the head up and
down. The earliest that I have had a chick fledge was at exactly
21 days old, but this must have been extraordinarily precocious for
they usually do not fledge until 28 days plus.
Like most other broadtailed parrots, if two nest boxes are pro-
vided the hen will usually start a second clutch and be in the early
stages of incubation before the first brood are fledged--the cock
rearing them entirely on his own.

Since Condon (1941) it has become usual to separate the genus
Platycercus into the rosellas Platycercus and the Australian ring-
necked parrakeets Barnardius. I find it impossible to accept this
division as it is largely founded on four particularly trivial differ-
ences : (1) The yellow nape of Barnardius is a not uncommon signal
mark in parrots and elsewhere, e.g. the Yellow-naped Macaw Ara
auricollis and the Yellow-naped Amazon Parrot Amazona ochro-
cephala aureopalliata, it is not considered of generic value. (2) The
scaly-looking mantle and covert feathers of rosellas. (3) Rosellas form
larger-sized flocks. (4) The amount of bone margining the ear canal
--rosellas have a slight arc of bone and Barnardius lacks this--but
as both types of ear are represented in the Red-rumped Parrakeet
Psephotus haematonotus (Holyoak 1973) this also counts for little.
Apart from my own pair, which are a hand-reared male and a
wild-caught female, both imported under licence, and their several
progeny, I have examined about a dozen other Port Lincolns in-
cluding a further five wild-caught individuals, smuggled out of
Australia via Singapore and sold openly to the trade last year. As
a result of this small, and therefore certainly very biased, survey I
completely endorse Forshaw's (1964) opinion that the wild population
contains a large number of individuals varying between the Port
Lincoln P. z. zonarius and the Twenty-eight Parrakeet P. z. semitor-
quatus. One explanation for the very wide distribution of "inter-
mediates" with population of "pure" Twenty-eights to extreme west
of their range and a population of "pure" Port Lincolns to the east
of their distribution--the Port Lincoln type of smaller body size, lacking
a band of red at the base of the bill and a yellow belly predominating
in the intermediates--would be that the two subspecific forms had
originally developed in complete isolation from one another. Since
then the range of the Port Lincoln subspecies has expanded westwards
to contact the Twenty-eights which then have hybridized. Because
there is probably little biological advantage of one subspecific fonn
over the other, or perhaps because of hybrid vigour, there is now
found a hybrid swarm rather than a comparatively narrow hybrid
zone between the two extremes.
Description
For a complete description see Forshaw (1964, 1973); otherwise it
might be sufficient to say that they are big (120-150 gram) glossy
green parrots with black heads and a yellow band across the nape
of the neck. They are of the same shape as the better known rosellas.
Status in captivity
In Europe and the U.K. they are still rather uncommon, although
they are well established and there should be little need for further
importations. I would hazard a guess that in the U.K. there are about

sixty to seventy individuals, the majority of which are closer to the
Port Lincoln type. Most of those bred find their way to the Continent.
General behaviour
These are extremely terrestrial and are seen as much on the
ground as perched. A most noticeable feature of their feeding be-
haviour is that they cut off pieces of plant stalk, such as grass, and
run these through a munching bill to extract the juices. This is so
evident that even when chickweed is fed they soon leave off search-
ing for the seed capsules and start eating the stalks as well. Plant
juices are rich in protein and a source of water which might explain
how these birds survive in hostile environments. An oddity of my
pair of birds is that they prefer canary to almost all other seeds
and eat very little sunflower, will take bread and milk, eat all kinds
of fruit and appear to prefer the kernel of hawthorn Crataegus
monogyna drupes to any form of food. They never eat hemp, al-
though I can get the young to do so for a few weeks and then they
too stop. I doubt that a Port Lincoln eats as much seed in a day as
does, say, a grass parrakeet.
The hand-reared male is tame but like other tame broadtails he
reacts towards me as he would to another of his own species, that
is he will make direct attacks if I come too close but does not if I
keep a little distance between him and me. A very noticeable feature
is for both sexes to lie pressed close to the perch in a copulatory
stance. This, I am certain, is a form of concealment for they only
do it when one is standing some little way off. They are quite active,
pleasantly noisy and bathe a lot. The adjacent pair of Cloncurry
P. barnardii macgillivrayi have never been seen to bathe at all.
Breeding behaviour
If my pair are in any way typical they appear to be extremely
willing to nest; the snag is that the male eats the eggs if he can and
consequently I have to remove them as soon as they are laid. This
means that he has to be removed the evening that an egg is expected
and returned after laying. Following the fourth egg I remove him
until the chicks hatch when he is returned from the adjacent aviary
and he helps feed them, for otherwise he is a model parent. His
removal does not affect the fertility of the subsequent eggs--she
usually lays seven. Incubation takes 19 days and the young fledge at
about 35 days old.
Courtship is difficult to describe, not that it doesn't take place,
but because as with most broadtails it appears to be a practically
identical display between the two sexes. The pair swish their tails from
side to side especially when they are disturbed. The tail is flared and
this is always accompanied by a rapid chattering. This chattering
and tail-swishing is seemingly directed against other birds, a declaration
of war. Likewise the position whereby the male mostly, but the female

sometimes, stands tall on his legs, pulls the head on to the chest and
pushes the wing-butts forward. This is a direct threat. Males (I have
not heard it from females) give a tut-tutting noise when they are
mildly annoyed.
This year, although I have had two fertile clutches, I have still to
get chicks. The weather was very cold and I believe that because the
hen has to feed herself during incubation--the cock being locked
away next door--that the embryos were too often chilled and died.
She is sitting again as I write, on six eggs some of which, I hope
will be hatched and reared now that the weather is much warmer.

Manycolours do not appear still to be common : I would be very
much surprised if there are more than 150 breeding pairs in the
U.K. This is a disappointingly low number for they seem just as easy
as Redrumps P. haematonotus to house and to get to lay eggs.
Probably the reason that the number available increases so slowly is
that many hens become indifferent to the need to brood their chicks
once they are more than a day or so old. This would be alright if
the weather was favourable. Secondly they seem more susceptible
to worm infestation, pseudotuberculosis and probably other diseases
than are Redrumps. This sensitivity to disease is certainly aggravated
because most people seemingly expect their birds to subsist entirely
on seed. Mine, just like the rest of my collection, have a small amount
of bread and milk daily often supplemented with green foods and
fruit when available.
My original pair of Manycolours were bought from Dr. and Mme.
Swaenepoel in 1970. That year, and every year since, I have success-
fully reared some chicks. The original cock died in 1972 of an
"aberrant eperythrozoon infection". This unpredictable and always
fatal disease is spread from wild birds by biting insects and is an
autumnal scourge of some parrots in the eastern, drier half of
England. The hen I lent to an acquaintance, such is the difference
between friends and acquaintances, and have not heard from the
acquaintance since. For three years I used to purposely mate brother
and sister and repeat this with their offspring to see if they carried
any abnormalities of colouring. After three generations of this very
close inbreeding, fertility was still not affected. Now I outbreed
always selecting for brightness of colour. Fortunately two years back
I was able to acquire a particularly brightly-coloured male from
Holland and the factors for this appear to be dominant, for all his
sons have an equal brightness.
General behaviour and breeding
These are precisely like Port Lincolns in courtship and general be-
haviour, including the clicking of the male but they appear to be

I end this rather miscellaneous collection of notes by mentioning
some of the softbills that came my way but, unfortunately, my
experiences were too short to be able to write much.
Several Redstarts, both Black and Common, passed through my
bird room. For some reason they only ever turned up in the market
as single birds. The only certain thing that I can report about them
is that I never lost one and that they seemed to be very easy to "meat
off". A trapper called at my house once to offer me some Stonechats.
He claimed to have had them for three days (demonstrating that
they would live in confinement!), but I guessed that they had been
caught that morning. I had not the faintest need for them and said
so. The price kept dropping and when he tossed in a male Black
Redstart I took them.
Somewhere back in the recesses of my bird brain I recalled Frank
Meaden telling me that the male Stonechat would dominate the
feeding pots and should be segregated. Well, I could not segregate
these. There were three pairs, plus the Black Redstart and I ended
up by putting them into a 6 ft. flight cage altogether. On top of the
accommodation problem, there were very few mealworms available.
To begin with I gave To-Vo, moistened with honey and finely-grated
carrot, sprinkled well with grated cheddar cheese and then topped
with Vionate-dosed mealworms in all stages. Two of the Stonechats
died almost at once, but the remaining two pairs did very well
indeed. They settled down to a daily routine of the above diet with

30 mealworms a day between the four of them (the Redstart was
removed). There was never any fighting at the food bowl. In the hand,
they were impressively fine and delicate birds. They would "chat"
like stones knocked together frequently and were very alert. After
six weeks, I released them in perfect condition.
One day at the office I was brought a box with "an injured tropical
bird" inside it. It had flown into the glass doors of the office entrance
and stunned itself. Through the holes in the side of the box it seemed
like a thin-billed Avadavat. The bird was a Firecrest: I placed it in
a wire-fronted and wire-topped cage with lots of bowls of food and
water. It spent all its time on the roof of the cage attempting to get
out. The next day it was dead and, as far as I could tell, it had not
touched any food at all. It seems as though this is a typical problem
with this kind of bird. Mr. Meaden suggested that, had I placed a
pot of mealworms up high, it would probably have taken them. The
problem was that it did not recognise the floor of the cage as a source
of food.
A couple of years later, I had the chance of a pair of Willow
Warblers and, remembering the Firecrest, placed them in a long, low-
roofed cage covered over with muslin. My bird journal contains the
following :
"To begin with, I gave exclusively mealworms of all sizes, pupae and beetle,
well dusted with Vionate. After 2^ days, i.e. sixth feeding, I gave some soft
food sprinkled with cheese and finely cut striplets of raw ox heart topped
with a dozen chopped mealworms. They ate the cheese, meat and mealworms
but not the softfood. Not surprising really; they probably were not hungry
by the time they reached it! Next day, they definitely took some of the
soft food (To-Vo mixed with finely grated carrot)."
I never reduced the mealworms below the dozen a day level but,
even so, an average of six a day is not exactly a banquet. They
stayed in lovely condition.
By experimenting and varying the presentations, I discovered that
by mixing the striplets of raw ox heart with the mealworms before
sprinkling on to the soft food, they would take it all.
On another occasion, I landed up with a cage full of odd softbills.
Sometimes I would release birds immediately, but my curiosity, plus
the knowledge that I would never have opportunities like this again,
often got the better of me. This particular lot included five Spotted
Flycatchers. They shook me somewhat and I must admit that I was
not confident. My journal reads
"Very shy and wild. Placed bowl of mealworms at either end of cage (about
4 ft. long) and they were hardly eaten at all; still some left at evening feed
time. Gave them supper of soft food mixed with cheese and sprinkled with
chopped up mealworms. Next morning, repeated. That afternoon gave
fresh soft food, this time cheese sprinkled on top, then striplets of raw ox
heart, then chopped mealworms. Next day all topping had gone and half of
the soft food gone. It definitely had not been scattered in search of
mealworms."
In fact, those five Spotted Flycatchers were terribly easy to keep and

really amazed me.
I kept Pied Flycatchers every year and the first time I saw one was
in a cage full of bustling and hopping Wheatears and Stonechats. It
was cowering in a corner. The dealer gave it to me since I was
obviously so concerned for it and he clearly believed that it would
die. Because of pressure on available cage space (the perennial blight
while abroad), I placed it in a cage with some Whinchats and some
other softbills. Mealworms were in short supply and things did not
augur well for the hapless bird. It had a habit of "freezing" horizontally
(crouched) facing me, whenever I entered the room and would stay
in that position until I left. Its condition, under these circumstances,
was near to being a trance for I could actually place my hand in
the cage and lift it from its perch. I soon took pity on the bird and
Crouching concealment posture of Pied Flycatcher.
released it. The interesting thing about this, however, is that it had
no live food at all, for its lively companions would scoff the lot long
before it recovered.
Another time I came across this species in the market when the
dealer had nine. I had promised to keep an eye open for a couple of
pairs for a friend who was very keen to try to breed them. It was
August and the plumage patterns were confusing. My journal entry
for that day reads :
"17th August: Three males were easy to select, one was an eclipsed adult
and the other two were probably early birds of the year. The remaining six
were very difficult, being immatures but out of their speckled fledgling
plumage. So, to avoid silly speculation, I took all nine, hoping to be able
to tell at leisure later and release the odd ones before long. I placed all
together in a two metre flight cage along with some Serins and wild
Canaries for company. Placed three bowls of mealworms in the cage, also
a bowl of Avi-vite mixed with mashed chicken liver and honey that had
been sprinkled with chopped mealworms. Let's see if the famous flexibility
of the Pied Flycatcher to adapt to food source makes this an easy meating
off."
The next day, 18th August:
"Every single mealworm had disappeared by nine the next morning. I
crumbled softfood, sprinkled it with a little finely chopped raw ox heart,

grated cheese and about forty mealworms, all chopped up. With mid-morning
post, mealworms arrived and I was able to give a few more.
19th August: Food this morning, large flat bowl of honey-moistened Avi-vite,
sprinkled with thin strips of ox heart, Vionate and chopped up mealworms.
One Pied Flycatcher flew to bowl and called shrilly before eating, a series of
peep } as if announcing the news before tucking in. All very fit and lively. Am
giving 100 (carefully counted) mealworms at a meal. It looks and sounds a
lot, but isn't so much when divided between nine birds, particularly the
latecomers.
20th August: I get the feeling that they are only taking the mealworms
and are very reluctant to take strips of meat, etc. Stood at entrance to bird
room after giving a second bowl of mealworms. A large bowl with about
40 mealworms had been given at 2 p.m. At 3 p.m. I placed another 20
in the bowl. After two or three birds had taken a worm, I noticed that a
male had mounted guard over the bowl. All were obviously not starving,
but as the odd bird flew down to feed so this male rose towards it and
drove it back. With the first feed of the day all got to the bowl, driven on
by hunger and at the 2 p.m. feed I noticed some birds playing tug-of-war
with the mealworms. However, with feeding only mornings, or early morn-
ings and evenings, it is possible for a dominant male to take over the
ownership of the bowl as soon as the first rush is over, and thus cause the
half-starving of weaker/more timid individuals."
Not wishing to experiment, I released the promised five and soon
arranged for the departure of two pairs. Shortly afterwards, I received
another Pied Flycatcher. I arranged, through a dealer that I knew, to
borrow a Peregrine Falcon for use at a Sales Conference. The theme
was falconry and, in the part where I took the rostrum and with
appropriate visual aids likened a good salesman to a falcon, 1 was to
have a live bird on my wrist. Being Spain, of course, nothing goes quite
to plan and a fine male Kestrel turned up. Nobody knew the difference
at the conference ! With the bird came a live Pied Flycatcher " for its
lunch "
I promptly gave the Kestrel chicken livers, and ran the flycatcher in
a cage along with some Nightingales and Wheatears. Its lesser size
notwithstanding, it showed none of the shyness hitherto experienced,
was always first to the food bowl and had taken several mealworms
before I had finished feeding them.
One day, a neighbour brought me a Blue Tit. It was newly fledged,
but the soft edge to the bill was barely visible. Apparently, it " just fell
on to my balcony They lived on the fifth floor in the middle of
Madrid. It was 9.15 in the evening. I didn't know whether the bird
was weaned or self-feeding so, still holding it from its box, I took a
mealworm, squashed the head and pushed it into the bird's bill It
held it firm. So I placed the bird in a cage. It held firm to the worm,
then swallowed it quickly. Three mealworms were given, all squashed
heads and all swallowed rapidly. These were picked up from a shallow
dish, held by the foot, chewed up and swallowed. By 9.30 p.m. the
young Blue Tit had taken six mealworms, and a little water. It was
very unsteady on its feet. I remember being impressed by its tiny head.
Despite its apparent instability, it was quite capable of tipping over,
stretched-out, almost upside down, to take food---then right itself. This

was rather than hop onto the food bowl.
Two days later, it was taking Avi-vite with grated cheese and a little
baby food; also mealworms and maggots. The live food was always
held in the foot, pulled and squeezed dry until only the skin is left.
This is then either dropped or occasionally swallowed. It proved to be
a delightful bird, but its never-ending movements and restlessness make
it an unsuitable bird for a cage. It would, no doubt, be best in a roomy
well-planted aviary, but who would care to provide valuable room to
such a common species? I've no doubt that it could be bred with little
difficulty.
I often saw Great Tits on offer. They were invariably expensive
(two or three times the price of a Nightingale for example) and were
quickly solck I suppose that they can be trained and become enchant-
ing pets. However, my interest was in other directions, and the butcher
reputation that Great Tits have certainly discouraged me.
My first Meadow Pipit Anthus pratensis was selected from a cage
crammed full of Goldfinches, with an assortment of odds and ends such
as Linnets and Rock Buntings. Since it was different, and I clearly
showed an interest in it, the dealer shot the price up to the equivalent
of about 20 pence. Being short of space I popped it into a cage with a
Robin. Almost at once, it took a mealworm and a sip of water and I
knew that it would be all right. It settled in well, but was always
nervous whenever I entered the room and took a while to calm down.
It seemed to be content to take Sluis Universal, moistened with honey,
plus a few mealworms each day. It protested vigorously whenever a
strange bird was billeted---however temporarily--in its cage. It would
sit perched, chirruping sweetly and softly for fairly long periods. At
night, it would roost, head under wing, in a corner of the cage on the
floor.
Over the next couple of months the Meadow Pipit had remained in
the same cage, but had received Siskins and Crested Larks as guests,
finally settling down with the Robin and a female House Sparrow and
I was able to watch its feeding habits. It would select a morsel from the
bowl of soft food, then run off, drop it to the ground, pick it up again
and then swallow it. One regular habit was to fly from its favourite
perch, hover in mid-air and then return to the perch. It remained in
perfect health for several months before eventually being released in
the countryside well away from trapping areas.
The only other pipits that I kept were also individual birds. I found
a Red-throated Pipit Anthus cervinus in a cage full of waxbills and
munias among the stall dealer's stock in the Ramblas of Barcelona.
(Incidentally, any reader who is visiting or passing through Barcelona
on a weekday will find a visit to the bird dealers there of some interest.!
This unfortunate bird was on its last legs, no doubt finding a diet of
panicum millet not very satisfactory! I had practically no mealworms

at the time and was somewhat at a loss. Rather naively I hoped that
the soft food being taken by the Nightingales, together with a few
mealworms, would be such an improvement on panicum millet that the
bird would respond. Alas, it was terribly emaciated and succumbed
about a week later.
Happily, the reverse was the case with Tawny Pipits Anthus
campestris. These birds seem much larger (though my field guides say
that there is only half an inch difference) and much more robust.
During a two-year period, I received three of these birds, releasing the
first two in the belief that I would never receive another, then keeping
the last one in vain ! Each settled in remarkably quickly, " meating
off " as if born to it.
My first Nightingales Luscinia megarhynchos arrived at the begin-
ning of the season in 1970. I had seen an odd bird, sold, in a dealer's
cage in the Sunday morning market and indicated a desire for two or
three. I left my address as a measure to endow the enquiry with my
sincerity and promptly forgot the matter. One evening a few weeks
later, there was a knock at my door and there was the dealer, dirty and
sweaty, fresh (?) from the country with a dozen sorry-looking Night-
ingales. I had not one single mealworm and a telephone call to England
that evening could not bring any within five days; luckily the trapper
had brought a sack with a hundred or so equally sorry-looking grass-
hoppers.
That night I took each bird and force fed it a fat and nourishing
grasshopper. Next day I released a lot of grasshoppers into two roomy
cages and hoped for the best. I soon discovered that grasshoppers had
to be " de-hoppered ", by having the rear legs nipped off. Such a hap-
less insect then walked about until a hungry Nightingale polished it off.
Grasshoppers were very satisfactory food but only as part of a totally
accepted diet. I found them to be of little help in " meating off ".
Normally, I chopped up mealworms over a bowl of soft food, and
found that this invariably worked. Chopped-up grasshoppers simpiy
dried out and did not appear to enhance the soft food one bit. I have
no idea why a chopped mealworm should retain its appetite appeal, but
a grasshopper not!
I found that good live food in adequate quantity was absolutely
essential for the first two or three days. With a free supply of meal-
worms for liberal lacing of the soft food, plus enough to ensure that
each bird had a few on which to go through the night, I was able to
" meat off " this species invariably within a fortnight. Mealworms and
any other live food then became a daily treat, often a very little one.
Keeping several birds in one medium-sized cage has proved success-
ful for periods of a few weeks, but I have never tried longer. In the
spring of 1974, I bought two believed pairs and had to isolate each
bird within two days; the males were singing vigorously and chasing

other birds. Normally, however, I have found that they mix very well
with Wheatears, Whinchats, Larks, etc. The main risk in keeping more
than one bird in a cage is that the fittest or strongest bird will eat all
the mealworms first.
In the earlier years, I supplied these birds with Sluis Universal
insectile food or Avi-vite, moistened with honey or fresh cream cheese,
sprinkled with grated (granulated) cheese and then a few chopped meal-
worms. In subsequent years I varied this recipe tremendously. The base
was always either Avi-vite or To-Vo from Holland. This latter food
had a fair amount of freeze-dried mini-shrimps and other goodies, and
the makers strongly recommended that it be moistened with grated
carrot. When so moistened it certainly has a lovely texture. I then
mixed ground, poached ox heart, or finely chopped raw ox heart or
chicken giblets. On occasion, I would add finely chopped hard-boiled
egg, grated cheeses, finely chopped cooked chicken, peanut butter,
tenderly poached liver, mashed; also provided a good animal protein
mixer. As a rule, I always re-moistened dry food with runny honey.
The food would then have finely grated cheese poured over it, stirred
a little. The mealworms, whether beetles, pupae or larvae, would be
chopped, well dusted with Squibb's Vionate and then sprinkled on top
of the bowl of food.
During the five years, several Black Redstarts Phoenicurus ochruros
passed through my hands and I managed to assist in forming a couple
of pairs for a breeding project. One entry in my journal for January,
1971, reads :
"Female. Rather nervous about this bird as it was very fluffed up and
obviously extremely unhappy in the dealer's cage. However, I placed it in
a small travelling cage in the back of the car together with a dish of
mealworms. By the time we reached home it had eaten five of them. I ran
it with a Robin and a Meadow Pipit. At first, it cowered a bit and seemed
particularly nervous about the Robin. By mid-January, it had become
confident and hops about, behaving naturally enough, flicking its tail and
curtseying like any healthy Redstart would do. It occasionally sits facing
into a corner, head up, when I am in the room, working, but this is un-
doubtedly a reaction to my entrance. After a while, when I have settled
down to painting or writing, it behaves perfectly calmly."
A couple of years later, I again had a female Black Redstart, this
time placed in a cage with two male Wheatears Oenanthe oenanthe.
My journal entry for September, 1973, reads :
" . . . received two 'females'--Wheatears--in beautiful condition, but on
second thoughts they could be immatures of indeterminate sex, or newly-
plumaged males. Books surprisingly unhelpful on autumn plumages and
immatures. Within 24 hours they were taking softbill mixture (Avi-vite)
with a few mealworms chopped up on top. They share cage with female
Black Redstart. One evening gave fresh soft food, with freshly grated
cheese on top, finely cut strips of raw ox heart on that, topped with
chopped (7 or 8) mealworms. The next morning I found the Redstart dead.
The day before, I had noticed a Wheatear going to the food bowl, eat some,
and stay resting perched on the edge of the dish. The Redstart clearly
wanted to eat, but would not go too close to the bowl because of the

Wheatear's presence. The latter was not at all aggressive, just passive. 1
decided to watch this situation carefully because the Redstart, which was
also new, might not get its share and should be moved. Obviously, I did
not act quickly enough."
A species that I found very satisfying indeed was the Bluethroat
Luscinia svecica cyanecula. This is the white-spotted morph that is
resident in Spain. I first received a male in the late autumn of 1972.
The trapper spun a yarn about having driven 300 kilometres into the
Gredos mountains and the high price had to include his cost of petrol.
I was too excited to care. The royal visitor had a large cage to itself
(resulting in the kind of overcrowding accident just related) and a
double ration of mealworms. I was very careful in the weaning pro-
gramme and did not push the bird at all. The throat patterning
gradually became apparent as the winter wore on and by mid-April
the bird was in glorious colour. It first started singing in January, a
very short staccato burst, almost invariably during the night. As the
weeks went by, so the song and its frequency developed. By the begin-
ning of April, this bird was in full song, rending the night (and often
the day) with great bursts of Nightingale-like song. I cannot find my
notes on song at the moment but I seem to recall the character of the
song as being mid-way between those of a Robin and a Nightingale.
The behaviour of the bird was interesting. It would flirt its tail wide
and cocked high, displaying the bright rufous edges of the upper part
and scold me like an angry chat. It zipped about its cage like a demon,
displaying and scolding whenever and all the while I was present and
active.
A female arrived in September. It was in excellent condition, but
either very shy or shocked. It stood utterly still until disturbed, when it
would panic. The chestnut of the tail was very noticeable, though not
as bright as on the male. The throat markings struck me as being very
distinctive and the shape and posture very Robin-like. For the first
four days it took mealworms exclusively, but by the eighth day it was
happily taking the same diet as that given to the Great Reed Warblers.
Subsequently, I received two more pairs of Bluethroats and in every
case, the difference in behaviour between male and female was very
noticeable. With familiarity came a certain amount of contempt but,
as a rule, I would say that they are quite easy to adapt provided that
one has a good supply of mealworms for the first few days.
Once accustomed to artificial foods, I found that they would eat
anything; I also found that they were great bathers, using up all the
water within a couple of hours. I, therefore, doubled the size of the
water pot but the water still went and the only result was to make the
cage wetter.
I managed to get a couple of pairs of Bluethroats over to England to
Frank Meaden for ASPEBA breeding. Each pair was given a large,
very richly planted outdoor flight and the birds were able to revert

totally to their natural behaviour. That is to say, they became invisible.
I have tracked Bluethroats by the song in two areas near Madrid; I
knew that my birds had come from one of these places but I was never
able to see one. On a subsequent visit to Frank, I sat quietly with a
can of mealworms in one of these aviaries and successfully photo-
graphed Bearded Reedlings, Nightingale, Stonechats and one or two
other desirable species. The mealworms tempted them into the open--
all except the Bluethroats.
Another species that gave me great pleasure was the Great Reed
Warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus . I was asked by an old trapper
if I was interested in the species. Since I had never seen or even heard
of the species in captivity, I said that I was. However, I stressed
umpteen times that it must be a pair, male and female and that, if in
doubt, I would take several birds in order to choose a pair. To my
surprise, a pair turned up at the house the very next evening. I was
absolutely delighted but tried to appear nonchalant. " Are they both
males?" I asked. I was instantly assured that they were. (This was no
doubt a combination of typical Mediterranean wanting-to-please by
giving the desired answer, plus the belief that males are always worth
more than females.) I went through the, by now, old rigmarole of
complaining about idiot interpretations of my requirements, that I
wanted a pair in order to breed them, that I did not want only males
for singing purposes, etc. The counter argument was ingenious--the
females are all on the nest, brooding eggs and cannot be caught (this
was June, 1972). The result was a reduction in price, plus a promise
that he would take a brood and hand rear it, thereby guaranteeing me
a tame hen for breeding. Needless to say, the said brood did not turn
up.
I was convinced that both these birds were, in fact, males. Both were
noisy, uttering snatches of their song and scolding me with great
profanity. Not having any knowledge or experience of them at all, I
supplied live food with a lavish hand and was depressed by their
voracious appetites. They were the equal of any Starling in their ability
to polish off 20 mealworms in five seconds flat. It was with some relief
that I managed to get a willing friend to take a carrying box in his
hand baggage on an early flight to England. The aviculturist who had
happily offered a roomy, planted aviary for breeding them was unfor-
tunate enough to manage to lose one while releasing it in the flight. I
cursed the man for an idiot, then promptly did the same myself a week
later! Rather than release the second bird deliberately it was given
board and lodging in the expert care of Frank Meaden in the hope
that I would manage to come across another.
That winter the bird--it was a male---went into one of the heaviest
moults that Mr. Meaden had ever seen; certainly the bird would not
have been able to fly and one wonders whether this is a natural process.

Certainly, living in dense reed beds in equatorial Africa, it might not
be a serious liability.
It was 15 months before another Great Reed Warbler came my way.
I had had a letter from England saying that if a female did not appear,
the lone male would be released before the migration period ended.
Shortly after this, I found a dealer in the market who had a cage con-
taining Reed Warblers, White throats and a single Great Reed Warbler.
There was also a Garden Warbler and a pair of Willow Warblers. I
took the lot and rushed home. Unlike the two of the last year, or the
surviving male, the Great Reed Warbler was silent. I placed it in a
roomy flight cage with a pair of Black-eared Wheatears that had
settled perfectly (and, what is more, were almost indifferent about meal-
worms) and everything went perfectly.
To my joy, a pair of Great Reed Warblers turned up a week later,
and I ran the three together in a flight of their own. From their
behaviour, I was certain that one was a male, and the other two
females. Although they are very nearly identical in appearance, the
male seemed to be bolder, fuller throated, larger headed and infinitely
more egotistic and extrovert--and noisier!
The diet that these birds seem to thrive on was the following:

cut in half and scattered on top.
Almost all of this was eaten with no waste or scatter.
I managed to take these birds to England to join forces with the
lone bird. The comparison was interesting. The " old timer " was larger
and fatter. The new male, while being leaner, was similarly vociferous;
all four hopped about excitedly like a reunion of aunts at a wedding.
That was in October, 1973.
The four birds over-wintered perfectly and Mr. Meaden was able to
place each pair in a separate and suitably large well-planted aviary.
In August, 1974, during my only too brief sojourn in England
between Spain and Venezuela, I managed to call Mr. Meaden who
brought me up to date on the progress of the Great Reed Warblers. It
seemed as though they had nested but not gone any further than laying
without brooding.

By D. T. Holyoak (Brighton, Sussex)
Despite the great development of modern ornithology, no con-
venient and up to date list of the bird species of the world is available.
Lack (1966) has argued the need for such a list for the use of ornitholo-
gists who do not have access to the systematic literature and for the
convenience of those who do, and Voous (1969, 1973) has discussed
and provided part of a list of recent Holarctic species, which should
lead to much greater uniformity of usage. Voous has rightly empha-
sised the difficulties in extending a Holarctic list to cover all living
birds, but such a list is perhaps most greatly needed for tropical
regions. Some of the difficulties in preparing a complete list can be
avoided if an index rather than a formal systematic listing is attempted,
but frequent revision would be necessary as the inadequate taxonomic
knowledge of many tropical birds is improved.
For several years I have worked intermittently on an index of all
bird species, which is now approaching completion, although much
checking and revision needs to be done. That part of the list covering
the Anseriformes is given here in order to provoke comment and
criticism of the treatment adopted, choice of English names and other
matters. Throughout the list families have been arranged alphabetically
within orders, genera alphabetically within families and species alpha-
betically within genera. This is done only in order to make the list
self-indexing and to remove the innumerable problems of the relative
positions of taxa. I believe that alphabetical listings, although con-
venient for a purpose such as this, have no useful place in taxonomic
accounts which are anyway usually provided with indices ( cf . Hall
1 9 68 ).
My choice of English names has been governed mainly by the extent
of usage rather than by appropriateness, length or other considerations.
Where difficult choices have had to be made the suggestions of Eisen-
mann (1955, 1966) and Voous (1973) have usually been followed.
Before publication of the complete list it is intended to seek the
advice of specialists on particular groups of birds (including the Anseri-
formes) for their criticisms, and hopefully to thereafter amend the
list at intervals, although this will necessarily depend on how many
" life-listers " buy it.

21 includes A. v. puna (Puna Teal), which may be a distinct species;
22 formerly placed in genus Salvadorina;
23 perhaps best regarded as a subspecies of A. fabalis, although Voous (1973, Ibis, 115, p. 620) and some
other authors prefer to keep it separate; its treatment is largely a matter of convenience rather than
of taxonomic assessment, and it is perhaps most convienent to afford it specific status;
24 formerly placed in genus Chen;
25 includes A. c. caerulescens (Blue Goose) and 'hyperboreus* (Lesser Snow Goose), now regarded as colour-

Columba alhitorques
By Carl Naether (Enicino, California, U.S.A.)
Wood pigeons, usually fairly large and more or less modestly
coloured birds, are found in many countries : in captivity, owing to
infrequent imports, they are rarely kept. In this rather short article I
want to comment briefly on the White-collared Pigeon Columba albi-
torques; also called Abyssinian Rock Pigeon. This interesting pigeon is
at home in eastern Africa, where it ranges from Eritrea to central
Abyssinia. According to Mackworth-Praed and Grant, authors of the
substantial handbook titled African handbook of birds, Series One,
" Birds of Eastern and North-eastern Africa," Volume i, the general
behaviour of the White-collared Pigeon is quite similar to that of the
European Wood Pigeon, with which no doubt many readers are fairly
familiar.
The general plumage colour of the White-collared Pigeon is a bluish
or blackish-slate. It derives its name from the attractive, pure white
collar, which extends across the nape, from ear to ear, being widest at
the back. The long pointed neck feathers are iridescent green. The
sexes are alike so far as plumage colour is concerned, but the hen is
slightly smaller than the cock. Young White-collared Pigeons lack the
handsome green gloss of the neck feathers.
The White-collared Pigeon's preferred habitat lies in the lofty moun-
tain gorges and plateaux, where it is accustomed to nest in rock and
cliff holes. In the city of Addis Ababa it is said to associate frequently
with the Speckled Pigeon in pairs or in small flocks, which, like most
wood pigeons, feed on grains, green food and wild berries in season. At
times quite large congregations of White-collared Pigeons descend on
ripening grain fields, where their intensive foraging causes considerable
damage.
Much like a typical rock pigeon, this species generally sets its more or
less flimsy nesting platform of straws and sticks in half-dark, sheltered
rock and cliff cavities, which are usually quite inaccessible to and diffi-
cult to locate by predators. In Addis Ababa, however, this pigeon
appears to have become rather bold, if not fairly tame, nesting there in
and about buildings. The usual clutch of this pigeon consists of two
creamy-white eggs, which hatch in from 14 to 16 days, the time varying
somewhat with climatic and other conditions. At the age of about four
weeks, the young pigeons leave the nest. At first, being unable to fly
well, they perch in trees not far from their nest, gradually lengthening
their flights in order to accompany their parents en route to feeding
and watering locations.

That the White-collared Pigeon is very seldom imported is evident
from its being rarely found in captivity. I have made inquiries concern-
ing its current status in American aviaries and was unable to locate this
interesting pigeon in any private or other collection. Jean Delacour
kept a single White-collared Pigeon for quite a number of years at
Gleres, France. He may have kept others but did not report any nesting
of this species. My correspondence of quite some time ago with the late
Professor A. Ghigi, indicated that the White-collared Pigeon as well as
the Snow Pigeon Columba leuconota were favourites of his. He was
successful in breeding both species in his extensive enclosures at
Bologna, Italy. Regrettably, he did not provide any details of the nest-
ing behaviour of either species. Should any member reading this
perchance be keeping and breeding White-collared Pigeons, his detailed
comments on this important phase of their behaviour in captivity

THE BREEDING OF SNOWY OWLS
In 1958 we received a female Snowy Owl from Hagenbeck and a
male from Copenhagen in the following year. They soon settled down
in their spacious aviary which is 6 m. long, 3 m. wide and 3.20 m.
high. At the back is a natural rocky wall where the owls prefer to sit;
a large wooden nesting box is fastened there but has never been used
for nesting by the birds. At the base of the wall water is permanently
running into a small pool and perches are fixed into the sandy soil. In
the third year after the male's arrival the birds scraped a hollow in the
front corner of their enclosure and in the second half of May four eggs
were laid. After 32-34 days the four chicks hatched--at the end of
June, 1962--and during the following years the owls have nested
regularly, except for 1973 when they did not breed. In 1966 the nest
was destroyed when the waste-pipe of the pool was blocked and the
aviary flooded. This clutch had been the largest of all; it consisted of
nine eggs--in the wild the number of eggs varies between three and
ten or more per clutch. All the other clutches from our pair have been
smaller, i.e. two of 2, three of 3, three of 4, two of 5, one of 6 and one
of 7 eggs. The eggs are laid at an interval of one to 2^ days. From the
literature we know that the main nesting period is from the middle
until the end of June, but our Snowy Owls have nested from mid-April
to mid-May and the chicks have hatched from mid-May to mid-June,
most of them at the end of May. During nesting time only white mice
and rats are given to the birds, about five mice for each young bird and
two rats for the parents per day. Altogether 48 Snowy Owls have been
bred : 47 have been sold to other zoos and one female has been kept
and is mated to a male from Osnabruck, but the pair have not yet
started to breed.

Writing to M. Delacour from Jalisco, Mexico, Mr. Jack A. Taylor
says : We have three Horned Guans Oreophasis derhianus , two of them
obtained as eggs from a nest in the area of the Volcano de Tacana in
Chiapas, Mexico, and the other as a chick. The eggs were flown here
under broody hens and actually started to hatch on the trip. The chicks
were fed on mealworms, fruit, large amounts of lettuce and alfalfa and
the lettuce is still one of their favourite foods. The nest was in a tree
and was hollowed out of the plants growing on and around the trunk.
In your book curas sows and related birds it is stated that the nest
of the Horned Guan had never been recorded and it was not known if
the birds nested in trees or on the ground. This nest was high above the
ground and the area where it was found is at an altitude of some 11,000
feet.
Of the Highland Guan Penelopina nigra we have obtained pairs of
wild birds, the first being adult and the others chicks; we have also
raised a number of them in 1974 and 1975. We have not found them
difficult to rear; the diet consisted mainly of fruit, grain, green food
and game bird feed. The chicks that we raised last year are now
starting to lay.

Mr. P. Duijzend, a member of the Society since 1927, writes from
Leersum, Holland, to say that a female South African Shelduck
Tadorna cana which he acquired in 1928 died in June this year. It was
one of 15 which his father imported from Pretoria; some were sent to
Cleres and the rest kept by Mr. Duijzend and successfully bred from.
This original female survived the war and other vicissitudes including
blindness in her old age and Mr. Duijzend wonders whether 47 years
is a longevity record for this species.

with no solid shelters. They are fed on various small grains; also milo

On a page of very interesting avicultural news in the Wildfowl
Trust's September 1975 Bulletin, Dr. Kear suggests that possibly the
choice of nesting site in waterfowl could be influenced by where the
birds themselves were hatched, those from incubators having perhaps
no particular taste in the matter. It would presumably be even more
likely in the nidicolous than in the nidifugous and it would be interest-
ing to know for instance whether House Sparrows raised in usurped
House Martins' nests themselves prefer House Martins' nests in which
to breed.

FLAMINGOS. Edited by Janet Rear and Nicole Duplaix-Hall.
Berkhamsted. T. &amp; A. D. Poyser, (1975). Pp. 246. Seven colour
and 48 monochrome illustrations. Price #8 net.
This excellent book results from, and forms the Proceedings of, an
international Symposium held at the Wildfowl Trust in 1973 and also
sponsored by the IGBP, IWRB and international zoo yearbook.
The erudite and infoimative introduction by Sir Peter Scott, is
followed by sections on populations, ecology and conservation of
flamingos, flamingos in captivity, ethology and taxonomy of flamingos
and flamingo physiology. The chapters are by 30 authors of varying
disciplines from many parts of the world. Though all the sections will
be of great interest to aviculturists, that on flamingos in captivity will
be particularly useful. This contains valuable papers on capture, hand-
rearing, and the breeding requirements of flamingos and accounts of
the experiences in the Copenhagen and Basle Zoos. It is a pity that the
paper by S. T. Johnstone " Breeding Flamingos at Slimbridge " pub-
lished in the avicultural magazine (May/June 1973, Vol. 79, No. 3)
was probably too recent to be included in the bibliography, as this is
one of the best articles of its kind that has ever been published in the
Magazine, and one that would be of great value to any potential
breeder of flamingos.
The Editors are to be congratulated on the content and presentation
of this outstanding contribution to the knowledge of this remarkable
group of birds.

Restall. London. Faber &amp; Faber (1975). Pp. 333. One col. pi.,
32 photos and 159 drawings. Price #7.
In this excellent book the author deals with all species of the families
Emberizidae, Fringillidae, Estrildidae and Ploceidae that are at all
likely to be obtainable by aviculturists in Britain or Europe. Indeed, a
few species that are hardly likely to be are, wisely in my opinion,
included where, as in the case of the bullfinches, discussion of the
nearest relatives is of particular interest in connection with a popular
and widely kept species. In all about 350 species are described, many
of them illustrated by attractive black and white sketches by the author.
There is a coloured plate, also by him, showing the heads of adult
males of 21 species of the genus Serinus.
Each family, subfamily and group of species within it is discussed
and then follows the list of species, each of which is described and,
where known, its needs in captivity indicated. The author has, wisely,
not in general tried to make bird-keeping sound simpler and less
troublesome than it must inevitably be if birds more demanding than
Bengalese or Barbary Doves are to be adequately cared for. He has also
been careful to state that in some cases his own experiences have been
different from those of others. He appends a list of species that have
been bred in captivity and recorded in British literature. In this list the
reviewer, with somewhat mixed feelings, finds himself not only credited
with the breeding of those waxbills with which he succeeded, but with
two--Jameson's Fir clinch and Black-crowned Waxbill--with which he
did not!
Obviously no book is flawless : there is a list and useful discussion of
some books and periodicals likely to be of interest to aviculturists, but
it seems a pity that no references are given of the works of some of the
German ornithologist-aviculturists, especially Nicolai's publications on
parasitic whydahs, estrildids and the Bullfinch. Most of us will dis-
agree with points here and there and may suspect that the peaceful-
ness of some of the author's birds may have been due to their not
having come fully into breeding condition. In the caption of the serin
plate, row three is omitted and rows four and five wrongly captioned
as three and four. It is, however, always easier to criticise a good book
than to write even a bad one. This is decidedly a good book and not
expensive as present day prices go. It can be warmly recommended to
all aviculturists.

Hatching Waterfowl Eggs by Incubator
Major Fletcher's letter in the July-September Magazine really asks whether it
is necessary for eggs of waterfowl to be cooled during their incubation. The
literature I consulted was extremely vague, unless one accepted the traditional
practice as proven fact. Therefore, as this is a particularly interesting subject,
I telephoned the two major hatcheries in the U.K., thinking that any worth-
while commercial enterprise raising tens of thousands of ducks for the table
would have to be conversant with most modern theory and practice of hatching
waterfowl eggs.
From my conversations it appears that, although it still may be observed in
some Continental hatcheries to purposely cool eggs, this is not now done
in Britain. Both hatcheries supply continual warmth to their eggs and, exactly
as with poultry, the greatest success of all comes when the incubator is filled to
its maximum capacity and when a previous hatch, or series of hatches, have
preceded it. This ideal state is therefore one which supplies a continual non-
varying temperature. Therefore the bigger the incubator and the more heat-
retaining its contents the better, for in these circumstances a good stable
temperature is held. They have found by experiment that cooling waterfowl
eggs reduces their hatchability.
The greatest cause of loss was by bacterial contamination created by dirty
egg-shells. Therefore, to reduce this pollution, eggs intended for incubation
should, if possible, be removed from the nest as laid: one person said that a
delay of two or three hours was unnecessarily long. When collected, the eggs
are dipped into an " egg-disinfectant " before storing. Unlike poultry, the eggs
of waterfowl do not keep particularly long (seven days was quoted as a maxi-
mum period for storage); after this time embryonic deaths rapidly rise. Because
these were both commercial hatcheries neither would let me have precise
figures, although both admitted that hatching was as high as for poultry under
good management which is, as I know, 85% or even higher.

I was most interested to read Mr. M. Ellis's comments upon my letter
&apos;* Introduced Lovebirds in Mombasa " in the January/March issue of the

Magazine.
Although during my visit to the coast of Kenya I did see " literally hun-
dreds " of Fischer's Lovebirds Agapornis fischeri on no single occasion did I ever
observe more than a flock of 30 to 40 and therefore, I hasten to say, in case my
letter has been misinterpreted, they were never seen in a flock of anything like a
hundred birds at any one time. The " hundreds " mentioned were seen along
several miles of coast--perhaps it was the same colony I saw over and over
again, but I do not think so.
For the last 20 years or more I have maintained a small liberty flock of
Fischer's, varying between a dozen or 20 birds, and I do know they never stray
very far from their aviary; I have seen them towards a mile away, but never
further and am under the impression that they are a bird that does not wander
far away from home territory.
On a previous visit to East Africa in 1970 I was fortunate to see a few pairs
of Fischer's Lovebirds in one of the Game Parks--I think the Serengeti in
Tanzania, but am not certain as I have mislaid my notes of that visit.
During a day spent in 1974 on Lake Naivasha observing the water birds, I
did see a couple of lovebirds and definitely identified them as Masked Agapornis
per sonata or Yellow-collared as they are known in that locality. The game
ranger with us at the time also saw them, agreed they were A. per sonata and
said I was lucky to have seen them as they were not a common species around

The Trade in Wild Birds
No member of our Society can by now not know something of what the
international trade in wild birds involves, and we must all have thought about
our part in it. There are two issues: the moral---are we justified in inflicting
suffering and death during transit on rather large numbers of birds so that we
may enjoy their beauty and satisfy our curiosity by their study, in our aviaries?
and the practical--how do we balance the possibility that we may be assisting
in the extermination of rare species against the possibility that we may assist in
their preservation by conserving a breeding nucleus in captivity? I believe there
is no absolute answer to either the moral or the practical question and find it
hard to agree with those who are convinced that the trade is altogether wrong
and should be banned outright, or with those who wish to keep it as free as it
has been in the recent past.
However, one cannot ignore the simple fact that the increase in demand for
exotic birds in recent years has occurred at a time of greatly increased pressure
on wild bird populations in the tropics for other reasons; I do not believe that
even the greatest optimist could contend that the arguments of Frith (1974),
Martin (1973) and Yealland (1974), writing in our Magazine on the effects of
culling wild bird populations, are groundless. So, I find it very odd that our
Society should appear to take no part in the activity now in hand internationally
to regulate the trade. We are, after all, the group of people whose interests are
perhaps most immediately concerned; we should be among those with the
greatest experience in the techniques of shipping birds by air, and we are a
Society of international membership with a voice in many countries.
It seems to me that there is also a possibility that as a Society we could, at
this point in time, play a practical and progressive role and I propose that our
President and Council take the initiative on our behalf. What I propose is that
they should give immediate support to the Royal Society for the Protection of
Birds in their campaign for the regulation of the trade.
I imagine that most members would support--at least in general terms--the
main recommendations which the RSPB has recently put to the British Govern-
ment. For those not familiar with them, they are essentially as follows: that the
Government is urged at once to ratify the 1973 Washington Convention on
Endangered Species, that limits should be set on the importation of birds likely
to suffer high mortality in transit and that all birds should enter in properly
labelled containers and only through a few, professionally staffed reception
centres. Are there any members of our Society unable to support these recom-
mendations? I doubt it, so let our President and Council offer the RSPB our
support without delay.
As Jean Delacour reminded us in his article in our 75th anniversary supple-
ment in 1969 " Innumerable species, which have never before been seen outside
of their native countries . . . are frequently exported in numbers--in fact, they
have been captured too much; the early losses have been tremendous by lack of
careful and knowledgeable handling and restriction of such activities is urgently
needed ". Indeed it is ! It is intolerable that six years after Delacour wrote those
lines our Society has taken no action to support or advise those organisations
which. are taking some steps in the right direction. If we wish to retain any
credibility as responsible students of birds, we can no longer stand aside. Let us
take at least the modest step I have proposed without any further delay or
debate: our longer term response to the situation can then be worked out at our
meetings with more leisure.

The Smuggling of Rare Australian Parrots
As an aviculturist I was indeed pained, though not surprised, to read of the
tragic fate that overtook the 14 rare parrakeets being smuggled out of Australia
in January 1975. I do not think the supposed high prices of Australian parrots
in Europe have been exaggerated and I fear that the smuggling with its
attendant suffering and losses will continue despite the increased penalties.
However, people who know Australian parrots, those in Australia in particu-
lar, must be aware that the Hooded and Golden-shouldered Parrakeets do well
in captivity and I saw, while on a trip to Europe in 1971, both of these breeding
prolifically in avicultural establishments in Holland and Switzerland, so while
I deplore the fact that these two beautiful parrots are, through aviculture,
having their numbers depleted in the wild state, I am grateful that they appear
to have a fairly secure position in aviculture today and that in the future it
might even be possible to reintroduce them to the wild state from our aviary
supplies should they be lost through factors like drought, deforestation for agri-
culture, an inability to adapt to change and the like. I regard the true avicul-
turist, as distinct from the mere collector, as the aider, not the enemy of the
conservationist. It is even perhaps arguable that, had the present day " know
how " in aviculture existed at the turn of the century, the closely related
Paradise Parrot might have been propagated successfully under controlled
conditions. I have never seen aviculture listed as one of the causes of the
decline of this parrot and do not know of any species that has actually been
made extinct through trapping for aviculture, but species like the Nene or
Hawaiian Goose and one or two species of pheasant have virtually been saved
by aviculture. By no means do I condone the activities of the smugglers, but I
feel that the efforts of the Fauna Squad could possibly be directed towards
ensuring that a strictly controlled number of the rare parrakeets, properly
trapped and handled, be made available from time to time to provide the
beneficial new blood for the aviary-bred strains both in Australia and overseas.
In South Africa the Transvaal Provincial Administration had enough foresight
in 1966 to build a special fauna station near Pretoria where certain suitable
species, trapped only in the right season by departmental officials, are correctly
housed until adjusted to aviary life. These birds are then made available under
permit to genuine aviculturists after their aviaries have been inspected. A
moderate charge is made to cover costs and this station has gone from strength
to strength, the number of species deemed suitable for sale to aviculturists has
continually been increased and a range of experimental breeding aviaries at the
station is planned for the near future. But most pleasing of all is the fact that,
once a legal source of birds became available, the illegal trapping that had
defied the law for decades virtually disappeared, to the inestimable benefit of
all our birds.
So it would be in Australia if the Department of Conservation were to
provide a limited, legal, even expensive source of birds for export. Such birds
would only be trapped professionally, in strictly controlled numbers and in the
right season: the numbers taken would depend on the strength of the species
in the wild state as estimated at the end of each season and the rare ones
perhaps only taken every other year or at even longer intervals and in very
small numbers, while species unsuited to aviculture would never be trapped.
The birds would be housed and exported under the best conditions and they
would provide some revenue for the Department for the furtherance of its
activities; also they would bolster the aviary-bred strains of Australian birds
throughout the world--and the smuggler would cease to calculate his smuggling
as a reasonable risk.

have never been too happy about the inclusion of Weber's Lorikeet T. h. weberi,
for although racial forms should interbreed freely with one another, this might
not necessarily apply for Weber's.
Weber's Lorikeet, with its all-green colour (no intermediate forms here) and
its very small size, is similar to the Perfect Lorikeet T. euteles; so close a
resemblance that Mivart, who could never be accused of " lumping ", recognised
the other races of T. haematodus as full species but made Weber's a subspecies
of T. euteles (monograph of the loriidae). In three adjacent aviaries, ideal
for making comparisons, Mr. Ray Kyme of Boston, used to house the Perfect,
Weber's and the Rainbow T. h. rubritorquis Lorikeets. I have spent several
hours looking at all three and, in my opinion, Weber's seemed to have more in
common with the Perfect. Mr. Kyme tells me that this holds for courtship
behaviour, voice, incubation and fledging times. And my observations on the
skeleton, although the physical size of the species concerned may be more
relevant, substantiate this.
The Perfect Lorikeet has an extensive range and Lomblen, one of the islands
in this distribution, is close by the island of Flores. The sole Trichoglossus on
Flores is Weber's, but some of the islands the Perfect Lorikeet inhabits are
shared with one of two different T. haematodus subspecies. The Perfect and
T. haematodus therefore do not hybridise. Of which species unless one
uncritically accepts Peters, is Weber's a subspecies? Gain is no help in this
puzzlement as he totally ignored the Perfect Lorikeet in his otherwise excellent
paper.
Which brings us back to the basic point, which is, who ultimately decides
what is and what is not a species? A superb example concerns the widely-
distributed, and therefore very variable, Yellow-fronted Amazon Parrot
Amazona ochrocephala, the most northerly population of which is the giant-
sized Double Yellow-headed Amazon A. o. oratrix . Away towards the other end
of South America is found the Blue-fronted Amazon Parrot A. aestiva which
differs from the nominate form of the Yellow-fronted practically by only having
blue on the face. To my considerable perplexity the Blue-fronted is said to be
a full species because it is isolated geographically, yet when hybridised with the
Yellow-fronted the offspring are indistinguishable from the latter bird. The
Double Yellow-headed when hybridised with the nominate form of the Yellow-
fronted gives an intermediate-looking offspring that looks every inch a hybrid.
In other words there is apparently more genetical difference between subspecies,
in this case, than with the species.
Lastly, could anyone who breeds the Green-winged Parrotlet F. xanthoptery-
gius observe whether their males stand with both feet on the back of the female
when pairing? Signor Bertagnolio's observation, in the Magazine, concerning
his pair which do so is very interesting. Exceptions to any behaviour pattern
are worth recording: I had a Budgerigar which scratched its head with the left
foot under the wing and the right foot over the wing, the left leg being
slightly deformed. Otherwise this parrotlet is exceptional to seemingly all other
American parrots, including the Celestial F. coelestis Parrotlet (Boorer 1964:
avic. mag. 70 :23-24) and the Blue-rumped Parrotlet F. cyanopygius (pers. ob.)
in that treading males retain a grasp with one foot on the perch.

I have recently added to my collection a specimen of what I believe to be
Rothschild's or the Intermediate Parrakeet Psittacula intermedia. First described
by Rothschild in 1895 from a single skin, the bird was, he said, intermediate
between P. himalayana and P. cyanocephala.
Dr. Biswas wrote about it in the journal of the Bombay natural history
society (Vol. 56, No. 3, pp. 558-562) and regarded it as a distinct species that
has escaped the notice of ornithologists because of its probable localised
distribution.

20 mm. and wing of 160 mm. The colour of the head is brighter than that of
the Rosy-headed due to very little tint of lilac, but far less brightly coloured
than the Blossom-headed. There is a trace of the black neck ring, but on the
nape there is some reddish colour resembling somewhat that on the nape of the
Rose-ring Parrakeet and below the ring there is some veridian green. The bill
is larger than that in the Blossom- or Rosy-headed and of a more reddish-orange
colour and the bird in general is distinctly different in colour from the Rosy-
Blossom- or Slaty-headed and looks, I think, like a hybrid between Blossom-
headed and Rose-ring.

Whilst fully sharing Mr. Arthur Prestwich's regret at the demise of the
British Aviculturists' Club (his letter, avicultural magazine, January/March
1975) I would respectfully point out that the decision to dissolve the Club was
not an arbitrary one taken by " the present regime " but the wish of the over-
whelming majority of members who had been sent a questionnaire concerning
their views about the Society's social activities. I count myself fortunate in
having attended as a guest some very enjoyable B.A.C. dinners but the fact
has to be faced that, with the soaring inflation of recent years, the cost of such
an evening now would be prohibitive to most members. The Wine and Cheese
parties are proving very popular with members and their guests who can spend
a convivial evening with refreshments and an illustrated talk for a very modest
price.
I could not let this opportunity pass without paying tribute to the great
contribution which Mr. Prestwich made to the Society during his long term of
office, both as founder and Secretary of the B.A.C., and as Honorary Secretary
and Treasurer of the Avicultural Society. I am sure that all members would
wish to thank Mr. and Mrs. Prestwich for their many years of hard work and
to hope that they are enjoying a happy retirement.

The accounts to December 1974 are enclosed in this Magazine.
Members will readily see that it is necessary to increase the subscrip-
tion and we once again appeal to you all to increase our membership.
For some time now, this Society, like all similar organisations, has been
fighting a losing battle against inflation. We have resisted raising the
subscription for as long as possible but, in view of the very large
recent increases in printing and postage costs, Council has reluctantly
decided that the cost of membership must be raised to #5.00 (U.S.
$13.00) on 1 st January, 1976.
We would point out that the only costs involved in publishing and
distributing the Magazine are printing and postage--the Editor and
the secretarial staff give their services for nothing, and every other
possible economy, however small, has already been made. We hope you
will agree that the standard of the Magazine has greatly improved
recently, particularly with the introduction of high quality colour
plates, and that even at the increased price, the Magazine is still
remarkably good value compared with similar journals. The Society is
entirely dependent on Members' subscriptions, donations and advertise-
ments for its income and we trust that we can continue to rely on
your support.
Members who pay by standing order are asked to notify their banks
of the increase and a form for this purpose is inserted in this Maga-
zine, together with the subscription renewal form for members paying
direct.

By J. Delacour (Cleres, Seine Maritime)
Hoopoes are very interesting and attractive birds, and are quite
unlike any others. There is only one species, Upupa epops , widely
distributed in central and southern Europe, Asia, Africa and Madagas-
car. The southern tropical subspecies differ only in the darker redder
tone of the plumage, the absence of the pale whitish marks next to
the black bars on the crest and a few other insignificant variations.
I have seen them all in the wild state and they all behave in the
same way. They frequent open country and farmland in areas where
there are enough old trees to provide the holes in which they nest.
They walk a great deal, finding their food on the ground. It consists
mostly of worms, large insects and their grubs which are found by
probing the soil and vegetation, the long bills being well adapted for
this purpose. They gather a good deal of their food among the drop-
pings of domestic cattle and other large mammals.
Hoopoes are rare summer visitors in Britain and northern France
and I have seen them wild at Cleres on only a few occasions. Nests
have been found several times in the hollows of old trees in orchards.
A brood of four was brought to us in 1947 : they were reared and
eventually presented to Mr. Alfred Ezra at Foxwarren Park where
they bred. We kept and reared a few at Cleres a little later on. The
dark Asiatic and African races have been kept and bred in several
European and American collections.
The sexes are similar in plumage, the males being usually slightly
larger and brighter in colour. In suitable countries they are fairly
abundant, but they prefer those with a warm summer in the northern
part of the range.
Hoopoes are excellent aviary birds, being quaint and pretty. Their
undulating flight displays the beautiful barred wings and they spread

and close their lovely crests as they move about. They need a large
open aviary where they can walk at leisure on sand and grass. They
are easy to feed on an insectile mixture, soaked dog biscuit, minced
meat and insects, particularly mealworms. They nest readily if suit-
able hollow logs or boxes are available; they are tame and confiding
and are harmless to other birds.

Urocissa erythrorhyncha
By Peter R. Richards (Gookham Dean, Berks)
This attractive crow has been bred several times in captivity and
there is a first breeding report recorded by Dr. Maurice Amsler
(avxcultural magazine, 1915), who lived at Eton only a few miles
away from my home.
I bought a pair of rather moth-eaten birds from a dealer at the
National Gage Bird Exhibition at Alexandra Palace in December 1972.
They were introduced into- an outside aviary 6 ft. x 12 and 6 feet
high, and they settled down quickly, feeding on a diet of day old
chicks (incidentally they hardly ever eat the remains of yolk, unlike
my other crows), maggots, bread and turkey-rearing pellets. There is
a small Philadelphus bush in the middle of the aviary and a sheet of
corrugated polythene sheeting as protection from the worst of the
weather on top.
They moulted and looked immaculate in summer of 1973. For-
tunately they are members of an eastern race and have rather bluer
plumage than some birds seen in captivity, and deep coral bills and
legs. I had selected the largest and smallest of the birds on sale and
fortunately they turned out to be a true pair. In 1973 I noticed the
cock bird feeding the hen but nothing else happened : in 1974 the
cock bird fed the hen regularly and in June he began to collect and
carry small twigs. I hastily constructed the framework of a nest out
of wire netting and fixed it in the Philadelphus bush and he com-
pleted a nest. The hen was induced to roost on the nest and for a
while my hopes were high, but before anything happened she started
moulting. In 1975 the cock continued to ply the hen with food, interest
was maintained in the same nest, and building began in March. This
was done entirely by the cock, and I have never seen the hen con-
tribute to the nest-building. In spite of the cold weather (it snowed)
nest-building continued; courtship seemed to consist entirely of court-
ship feeding, the tail being spread only in threat and aggressive dis-
plays. On the 7th April the first (white with chocolate spots) egg was
laid, a second on the 8th and a third on the 10th. The nest was not

very robust and the eggs could be seen through the bottom. The hen
did not sit at all tightly; in fact she only seemed to incubate when I
went near their aviary during the first week. After that she sat more
steadily, being fed by the cock who was not seen to incubate at all.
One egg unfortunately broke, but two chicks hatched together on the
28th April (incubation time c. 20 days). The chicks were naked and
pink but changed to grey by three days old. They were also not
brooded closely except when I disturbed the hen, when she immedi-
ately went to the nest and scolded me loudly in the typical magpie
chatter, her tail spread widely. Feeding was done mainly through the
hen, the food being collected by the cock who passed the food to her.
The chicks grew fast and by the twelfth day (9th May) they were
approximately half-grown. Their heads and backs were feathered and
their flight feathers were coming through; however they were sur-
prisingly naked compared with young Rooks or Jackdaws of the same
age and development. I decided at this stage to hand-rear them, which
proved very easy. By seventeen days they were two-thirds grown,
their heads were well feathered, the white mark of their parents was
considerably more extensive, spreading over the top of the head to
the base of the bill, making them look like little Badgers. They were
sitting on the side of the nest by the 18th May (21 days), and they
left the nest for good on the 28th May (30 days). Unfortunately a
nasty yellow swelling had made its appearance on the shoulder and
hip of the smaller bird at this time and a week later the larger chick
developed similar lumps. At first the birds were not affected, but by
the middle of June they were unable to fly and became lame as these
swellings increased in size. Alas, the lumps turned out to be due to
aspergillosis, a fungus disease, the spores of which my birds had inhaled
somehow, perhaps from damp hay; anyway the disease progressed
and they both died at the end of June aged fifty days. At this time
they were fully grown, feeding well and they looked more like young
European Magpies Pica pica than their parents; their heads were a
softer black, their underparts white, backs grey and only their wings
and tails, which were two-thirds grown, were blue like those of the
adults : the bills and legs were flesh pink.
All was not lost, for the hen laid again nine days later, in the same
rather dilapidated nest (no attempt being made to re-line it) on the
18th May, laying five eggs by the 22nd May. Incubation proceeded
on the same rather unsteady lines and the first bird hatched on the
5th June, two more on the 6th (18-19 days) and another on the 7th
June (18 days). The last egg was infertile. They seemed to thrive,
but when I came down to feed them on the 9th June the nest was
empty. On examination of the aviary there were little bits of the
chicks all over the place, and I suppose the parents had eaten them.
However, the hen laid another five eggs nine days later, starting on

the 17th June. These hatched between the 6th and gth of July, one
egg being clear. The nest was very dilapidated indeed by now and I
was fearful that the young might fall through the bottom and when
one young bird disappeared on the 13th and two more on the 14th
July, I rescued the remaining chick, aged 10 days, and hand-reared it.
This time I kept it well away from any straw or hay, and it has grown
into a nice little bird, which at the time of writing, 25th September,
is beginning to moult into adult plumage and its bill is beginning to
turn coral red.
No further clutches of eggs were laid and the parents began to
moult on the 7th August. At the moment the moult is almost com-
plete and the cock is showing interest in the nest again, although I
have not seen him feed the hen.
The nestlings were hand-reared on the diet supplied to the parents.

HAND-REARING GREEN WOOD HOOPOES AT THE
NEW YORK ZOOLOGICAL PARK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.963511" page_id="56381593"  page_num="4" year="" vol="">
By Donald Pruning and Joseph Bell
The Department of Ornithology
A pair of Green Wood Hoopoes Phoeniculus purpureus marwitzi
received at the Bronx Zoo during the summer of 1970, was part of
a collection of African species acquired for the huge World of Birds
display, then under construction. As each of the new building's
twenty-five natural habitat type settings was completed and land-
scaped, birds were introduced. Apart from allowing them a longer
period to become established before the formal opening of the new
facility (in June 1972) this procedure also provided time for the many
adjustments to both the collections and the plantings of each display
to achieve proper balance and to minimize various maintenance
problems.
It was apparent that the wood hoopoes presented such a problem
soon after they were released in a heavily planted display for African
birds, early in 1971. Attracted to the host of parasitic insects on the
new plantings, their constant gleaning activity resulted in serious
damage, particularly to tender new leaves and buds. The problem
was resolved by moving the wood hoopoes to a two-level swamp
display where thick plantings of dwarf Japanese palm Rhapsis excelsa,
bamboo palm Chamaedorea elegans, and the climbing aroid Monster a
deliciosa are confined to a series of islands in a large, shallow pool
that covers the floor of the exhibit. A dozen tall swamp cypress
Taxodium distichum trunks that rise more than 11 metres to the fully
skylighted roof, offered an even more fertile foraging ground than the
live plants.

Cylindrical in shape, with a diameter of about io metres, the
swamp was conceived to illustrate the nesting stratification that occurs
in any type of forest: platforms and hollows are provided at every
level to encourage the breeding activity of a variety of species, in-
cluding Black Rails Limnocorax flavirostra, Sun Bitterns Eurypyga
helias, Red-rumped Woodpeckers Picus erythropygius and several
species of touraco (Musophagidae).
The wood hoopoes explored every cavity in their new environ-
ment. On a number of occasions it seemed almost certain that they
were nesting, but on investigation no eggs were found. The only
recorded captive breeding for this species was at the Winged World
in 1968 (avicultural magazine 74:5:184-185) and it was hoped
that this accomplishment might be repeated at the Zoological Park.
Finally in the latter part of May 1973, a keeper reported that
both wood hoopoes were carrying food to a pocket on the side of one
of the tree trunks, used as a container for air plants (bromeliads).
Close observation revealed that they were indeed feeding a small
chick. The young bird grew rapidly and ventured from the nest for
the first time late in June. Although every possible precaution was
taken (including draining the pool each night) the chick drowned soon
after the pool was filled, on the seventh day after fledging.
Notwithstanding this tragedy, the pair was determined to nest
and by September they were back on eggs.
The site chosen this time was a hollow in a dead tree branch
that extended across the display just above the water's surface;
easily accessible for both observation and management. Two chicks
hatched on the first of October and by mid-month they could be
seen regularly extending their heads from the hollow to be fed by
their parents. Rather than run the risk of losing this clutch, they
were removed from the nest hollow at the point when they were
fully feathered and ready to fledge. Placed in a small cage equipped
with a heat lamp and a nest hollow similar in size and conformation
to their natal home, it was necessary to force-feed them for about
ten days before they began to pick up food on their own. Daily weights
of the chicks and measurement of the food offered to them were
valuable tools in monitoring their progress (see chart on feeding).
Both were fully grown and starting to show adult coloration in their
plumage by early December.
At the same time that the young wood hoopoes became fully
independent, another clutch of four eggs was discovered in the
swamp's nest hollow. Unfortunately these were found broken several
days later and two subsequent clutches met with the same fate.
When five eggs were discovered on 10th February, 1974, it was
decided to remove them for artificial incubation. Two of these
proved fertile and hatched on the 22nd and 23rd of the same month.

Averaging just over three grams at hatching, the blind, nearly
naked chicks were placed in a small hollow nest, made from a section
of heavy cork oak Q. suher bark, and kept in an incubator at a tem-
perature of 95 degrees Fahrenheit with fairly high humidity (above
80 per cent) to avert any dehydration problems at this early stage of
development. Very small pieces of newly-born white mice and bits of
Gaines Dog Meal (a commercially prepared ration) were offered from
the tips of forceps at intervals of two hours from seven in the morn-
ing until five o'clock in the afternoon.
The young wood hoopoes grew very rapidly, more than quad-
rupling their original weights during the first week and passing the
35 gram level at the end of the second (see growth rate graph). At one
month of age they were feeding on their own, growing long tail
feathers and generally resembling adults, only lacking bright red bilks
and feet, a change that does not occur until they are between six and
seven months.
To date 15 Green Wood Hoopoes have been reared at the Zoo-
logical Park : four of these were hatched in an incubator. A number
of other hatchlings from the very prolific breeding pair did not survive
the delicate period as nestlings or subsequent "breaking-off" to
independence.
Although captive management of this species is no simple task, the
success achieved thus far has clearly indicated the value of the effort.
Realising this, the Los Angeles Zoo has very kindly loaned a single
male in their collection and space has been provided in our new
off-exhibit breeding facility to attempt pairing the young birds and
carry the project forward on a long term basis.
On 25th August, 1975, the 16th fledgling wood hoopoe emerged
from a nest hollow in the African Jungle exhibit at the World of Birds.
This was particularly significant since it is a second generation here at
the zoo. The parents of this chick hatched here in October 1973 and

NOTES ON ESTABLISHING AND BREEDING EUPHONIAS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99329376744186" page_id="56381599"  page_num="8" year="" vol="">
By Johan Ingels (Destelbergen, Belgium), Jozef Maroy (Maroy-Zoo,
Waregem, Belgium) and Erik Norgaard-Olesen (Janderup, Denmark).
Although euphonias are imported in reasonable numbers, estab-
lished pairs are rarely seen in confinement and in spite of an obvious
sexual difference, breeding results have always been somewhat rare.
In 1967, five Velvet-fronted Euphonias Euphonia concinna were
reared at Winged World, Heysham and Morecambe, England (Nor-
gaard-Olesen, 1970). During the period 1969-71 Ingels succeeded in
rearing four male and three female Purple-throated Euphonias Eu-
phonia chlorotica from one pair (Ingels, 1971). In 1970, one Thick-
billed Euphonia Euphonia laniirostris was reared at the Jersey
Zoological Park (Roles, 1971). The only other species known to have
been bred successfully is the Violaceous Euphonia, or so-called Violet
Tanager Euphonia violacea (Drake, 1937; Lint, 1972).
Compared with the number of euphonias imported, these breeding
results are disappointing. This could be due partly to the difficulties
experienced when attempting to establish newly imported birds and
partly because certain breeding activities are shared by the male and
female, thus requiring both birds to be in breeding condition for some
length of time (see later).
Newly imported euphonias are often heavily infected with cocci-
diosis and occasionally with salmonellosis, both difficult to cure in
small birds. A systematic control by a veterinary laboratorium of the
droppings of newly imported euphonias, revealed that approximately
65% suffered from coccidiosis (Vandevijver, 1975). Whole consign-
ments of tanagers have been struck down with salmonellosis shortly
after arrival in western Europe; most of these birds became infected
in their country of origin, due to being housed in infected cages
(Ingels, 1974). Euphonias are most sensitive and usually are the first
to succumb in mixed shipments.
On importation euphonias are also extremely sensitive to malnu-
trition. After their arrival, should they be kept purely on a fruit
(mostly banana)--"universal" food diet, a liver disease may develop,
which more often than not proves fatal.
We have had reasonable success in establishing euphonias with a
food containing the following ingredients : finely chopped apple, pear,
soaked currants, plus a little banana, with some grated cheese, boiled
minced meat and egg, mixed with a blend of good insectile foods
and multi-vitamin powder. A liberal portion of deep-frozen ant pupae
and "white" mealworms is added to this mixture. As well as this
softfood, a nectar mixture for nectar-feeding birds is offered.
One should avoid giving newly imported euphonias too much
banana and "universal" food, or a diet with a high sugar content.

<bodyText confidence="0.998674844444444" page_id="56381600"  page_num="9" year="" vol="">
A strict control on disease by regular checking of droppings, should
be maintained. It is possible to cure coccidiosis and salmonellosis by
adding a drug containing sulfamezathine to the birds' nectar; the
dosage being 2.25 g (approx. 35 grains) of sulfamezathine to 1 litre
(approx, if pints) of nectar. The treatment should be carried out
for 5 consecutive days after which a rest period of 7 days is required
before again dosing the birds for a further 5 days. During the 7 day
period, a polyvitamin mixture should be added to the nectar.
Even when the above treatment is carried out, sudden loss of
flesh (the well-known "going light"), followed a few days later by
death, is still prevalent when attempting to establish newly imported
euphonias.
If an attempt at breeding is to be made, a pair should preferably
be housed on their own. When mixed with larger tanagers, the stress
of being continually on their guard appears to prevent them settling
down and coming into breeding condition. The pair of Purple-throated
Euphonias mentioned above, reared seven young within three years
in a 90 m 3 (approx. 3300 cubic feet), densely planted outside aviary,
which they shared with a breeding pair of Golden-masked Tanagers
Tangara larvata .
Most tanagers, including euphonias, which arrive during the summer
will breed successfully only after being kept in confinement for at
least a summer-winter period. Should they be brought in during the
winter, they will usually attempt to breed only after a winter-summer-
winter period.
Contrary to other tanager genera, both male and female euphonias
share breeding activities, except for incubation and brooding which
is carried out by the female only. Therefore both the male and the
female need to remain in full breeding condition for a lengthy period
if a breeding success is to be realised.
The sharing of breeding activities is best demonstrated by the
"mutual" pre-nuptial feeding, observed in euphonias. Although male
tanagers of numerous species offer food to their mates, either while
they incubate or as they forage together, only in euphonias do the
males sometimes accept food from their mates. This occurrence has
been observed in the wild with the Tawny-bellied Euphonia Euphonia
imitans (Skutch, 1954). In captivity, we have seen a female Orange-
bellied Euphonia xanthogaster feeding a male Bronze-green Euphonia
Euphonia mesochrysa through the wire of adjacent aviaries. This
behaviour was observed by all of us in Maroy-Zoo's aviaries during a
visit of Norgaard-Olesen to Belgium in 1970.
In building their domed nest, the male and female euphonia work
together; usually, however, the male is the more industrious. The
male of the pair of Purple-throated Euphonias became so stimulated
that it completed a second nest without any help from the female.

Once the first nest was completed and the female commenced to
incubate, the second nest was used by the male as a dormitory.
As already mentioned incubating and brooding of the young is
carried out by the female only; however, even during the incubation
period, males are more active than in other tanager pairs. When a
female returns to the nest after a break, she is always escorted by
the male, who follows her very closely.
Feeding of the young is shared equally by the parent birds. Usually
the male feeds first, perched in the nest entrance; the female then
enters to feed the young, especially when they are still small and
require brooding afterwards.
Euphonias feed their young wholly by regurgitation; in this respect
differing from the majority of tanagers. They should therefore
prove easier to rear in captivity, yet the opposite is the case. Although
fruit and berries are fed to the young soon after hatching, a breeding
pair require a plentiful supply of suitable livefood if the young are
to be reared. At the Jersey Zoological Park the Thick-billed Euphonias
ate only spiders together with grape pulp. The pair of Purple-
throated Euphonias, living in an outside aviary, caught large numbers
of insects, but readily accepted ant pupae, maggots and mealworm
pupae as well as their usual softfood, thus increasing considerably
the amount of protein in the regurgitated food.
Nests may contain as many as five nestlings resulting in a pro-
nounced need for protein, compared to other tanagers with only two
young in a nest. When the amount of protein offered by the parent
birds is insufficient, the smaller nestlings may starve (Roles, 1971;
Drake, 1937).
After the young fledge, both parents continue to feed them, but
within a week or so the female may be incubating again, leaving the
male to complete the rearing of the young.
Usually a pair of euphonias require from 50 to 65 days to build
a nest, lay and incubate eggs and rear young to independence. Other
tanagers, e.g. Tan gar a species, only require from 40 to 50 days.
For the reasons mentioned, to breed euphonias successfully, an
aviculturist needs to have a well established pair in full breeding
condition, readily accepting a suitable livefood or a softfood with a
high protein content.

THE 1975 BREEDING SEASON
By Rosemary Low (Barnet, Herts)
As one who keeps no Australian parrots, with the exception of
cockatoos, I find it is as well not to expect even a reasonably suc-
cessful breeding season. Chicks of species which have seldom or
never previously been bred may not be reared--but much can be
learned. It was very encouraging that all known true pairs produced
eggs, with the exception of the two pairs of cockatoos and a pair of
Red-capped Parrots Pionopsitta pileata; the latter were put outdoors
too late in the season. Birds which made no attempt to breed and
whose sexes are in doubt, were Orange-winged, Salvin's, Yellow-
shouldered and Double-Yellow-headed Amazon Parrots Amazona
amazonica, autumnalis salvini , harhadensis and ochrocephala oratrix,
Black and Duivenbode's Lories Chaleopsitta atra and duivenhodei and
Yellow-thighed Caiques Pionites leucogaster xanthomeria.
The 1975 season could be said to start at Christmas 1974 when
a pair of Meyer's Lorikeets Psitteuteles flavoviridis meyeri in a small
colony of this species was found to have two eggs. The birds were
imported in 1973; most were in immature plumage and none made
any attempt to nest during the summer of 1974.
The Meyer's provided one of the major disappointments of the
season; removing dead chicks from their nests turned into a habit.
There are six birds in the aviary and I believe that these are four
males and two females; distinguishing individuals is very difficult
and the only sexual distinction is a very slight one in the size of the
beak, which is larger in the males. A brief description of this species
may be useful, as before 1973 only isolated examples had been
imported. It is 17 cm (6f in.) in length and most attractively marked
in green and yellow. The upperparts are a rich dark green and the
yellowish-green feathers of the underparts are edged with the same
colour. The ear-coverts are yellow and the head is brownish-olive.
The beak and the irides are orange.
The first clutch of eggs resulted in a chick which was heard for
the first time on 28th January : it lived for three weeks.
On 1st March the hen laid again; on the 29th part of an eggshell
on the aviary floor indicated that a chick had hatched, perhaps a

couple of days previously and the chick lived until 27th April.
Meanwhile a second pair had been incubating and chicks were heard
on 23rd May; both died on 31st May. Examinations carried out on
these three chicks revealed no discernible cause of death in two, but
one from the second nest was suffering from fatty degeneration of the
liver. Both the latter had food in their crops at the time of death.
As over-rich nectar food was a possible cause of death, I diluted
it with an additional quantity of water and cut down the ingredients;
they then received nectar consisting of one to two heaped table-
spoonfuls of glucose and one of malt in about 25 fluid ozs. of water.
A small amount of condensed milk and a tablespoonful of Farex
baby cereal were added. In addition, the Meyer's received soaked
millet sprays, apple and sunflower seed. Only small amounts of the
latter are eaten; also a little lettuce on occasions. Many other seeds
and foods have been offered and ignored.
The next two chicks had hatched by 10th June. Unlike the others,
they were seldom heard calling for food. One died on 21st June;
examination again revealed fatty degeneration. There was food in its
crop, but the second which died on 23rd June had no food in its
crop and died from no discernible cause. It is possible that the parents
deserted and both these chicks seemed scrawny in comparison with
those from previous nests.
Next year, I hope to persuade my husband, who is employed locally,
to hand-rear any chicks which are hatched. I should like to try this
myself, but as I have over three hours travelling daily to and from
my place of employment, this is out of the question. We also intend
to divide the aviary into sections, to prevent the inevitable squabbling
which takes place throughout the year. With the possible exception
of Gockatiels, I do not believe that there is such a thing as successful
colony breeding with parrots, except, perhaps, in an extremely large
aviary. Had the Meyer's chicks lived, it is quite possible that they
would have been murdered as they fledged.
The next disappointment was caused by the Iris Lorikeets Psitteuteles
iris of which we have four, obtained in 1972. They are extremely
pretty little birds, the same size as the Meyer's which, of course,
belong to the same genus. One believed pair were not in good health
on arrival and spent much time, including last winter, in an indoor
birdroom. They were placed in an outdoor aviary at the end of
May, but made no attempt to breed.
The other two are delightfully tame and never fail to endear them-
selves to visitors. The hen laid several clutches without success in
1973 and 1974. On one occasion I picked up from the aviary floor
a fertile egg which had been incubated for nearly three weeks. It is
not possible to inspect the nest box because the birds are so tame
that they look on the opening of the aviary door as an invitation to

come out to play; even opening the feeding hatch is fraught with
danger because of the incredible speed with which they move about
the aviary.
On 20th May I made a note in my diary that the hen had
probably laid. She is heard calling loudly for food throughout the
incubation period and is fed in the nest by the male; I have never
seen the male feed the hen outside the box. The two birds are very
playful and aggressive towards each other and if attention is given
to one bird, the other invariably attacks its mate out of sheer jealousy
and they roll over together, fighting furiously.
On nth June something about their behaviour made me suspect
that a chick had hatched; this was not confirmed until 14th June
when I heard the chick. Assuming that the chick had hatched on
nth June, this would give the already proved incubation period of
23 days (see "Breeding the Iris Lorikeet", Ray Kyme, avicultural
magazine, January-March 1975). I was fairly confident that the
chick would be reared because, as is common with very tame birds,
the Iris Lorikeets will sample all foods offered and habitually take a
wide variety of items. I was particularly interested to note that there
was a steep decline in nectar consumption from the time the chick
hatched. It is possible that a similar phenomenon occurred with the
Meyer's Lorikeets, but in a colony observation of this kind is not
possible.
The Iris Lorikeets consumed mainly seed while the chick was in
the nest; also fruit and soft foods. Psitteuteles species must have seed
at all times; I believe nectar is a less important item of their diet in
the wild than in the larger lories. The "brushes" on their tongues are
difficult to observe and for some time I was in doubt as to whether
they were actually brush-tongued! It seems that the "brushes" are
less well developed than in the larger lories; also, in proportion to
their size, the skull is stronger, suggesting a greater crushing power
of the beak; both these factors suggest that seed is of greater im-
portance in their diet.
The seeds taken by the Iris Lorikeets were sunflower, canary, white
millet, niger and spray millet: no other seeds were offered. The
spray millet was soaked for at least 48 hours, until it had begun to
sprout, then washed. This was discontinued when the chick was four
weeks old and when the male unfortunately became ill, so in case
insufficiently washed millet sprays were the cause, no more were
offered.
On 8th July I removed the male from the aviary as he was
obviously unwell. He ate nothing at all that day despite attempts to
tempt him with favourite tit-bits. At 11 p.m. I force-fed him with
nectar and Horlick's milk; as he is so tame this caused no stress. The
following day he was very ill indeed and started to vomit, a fact I

noted with a heavy heart because all too often in lories it means that
there is no hope of recovery. I force-fed him with nectar and
chloramphenicol, an antibiotic which has saved the lives of several of
my birds in the past. The force-feeding, including the antibiotic, was
continued for two more days and by 12th July he was too strong
to allow me to do this, so the antibiotic was added to the nectar.
On that day I knew without a doubt that he would recover.
On 15th July, I failed to hear the usual loud cries of the chick
and, fearing the worst, entered the aviary. The chick was dead and
examination showed that there had been haemorrhage of the head.
I can only conclude that the hen, tending it on her own, had caused
the injury--perhaps in protest at its incessant cries for food. At the
time of death its crop was full and the chick weighed as much as an
adult. Its beak was black. The green feathers on the back and wings
had been chewed by the hen (I had examined the chick for the first
time when the male was removed from the aviary; it then had more
feathers than when it died); greenish-yellow feathers were appearing
on the underparts and orange feathers on the crown.
The male, completely recovered, was returned immediately the dead
chick was removed, but the pair made no further attempt to nest. Two
more Iris Lorikeets, obtained from separate sources during June, were
put into an outdoor aviary on 31st August and mating was observed
four weeks later. A chick was heard on 13 th November : that night
there was freezing fog and the temperature fell to 29 deg. F. (- 2 deg.
C.). Next day two chicks could be heard, but they died on about 23rd
November.
We have had several Fairy Lorikeets Charmosyna pulchella roths-
childi since the autumn of 1973 and in 1975 the first nesting attempt
took place. I do not believe these tiny lorikeets should be wintered
outdoors unless provided with a heated shelter; ours therefore are
taken indoors from November to May each year.
Although we were not successful in rearing young, we did dis-
cover a most interesting fact and one which appears to have been
hitherto unrecorded. E. J. Brook bred one Fairy Lorikeet in 1913--
and I believe that this is the only occasion on which this species has
been bred. Fie had his birds five years before they were successful
and had rather lost interest in them. Because of this he could record
almost no information concerning the breeding.
Our Fairy Lorikeets spend considerable periods inside the nest box
during the day, but at the beginning of August we noticed that only
one bird was out at a time--and it was usually the hen. Meanwhile,
the male's tail could be seen through the nest box entrance. From
its position, there was little doubt that he was actually incubating!
We were soon able to establish that this was so. It would therefore
seem that the Charmosyna lorikeets share with the Vini species the

distinction of being the only members of the Loriinae in which incu-
bation is shared by male and female, a fact that would tend to prove
the close relationship of these two genera.
On 14th August, there were several hours of torrential rain of
tropical intensity. When it subsided enough for me to venture into
the garden, I found the Fairy Lorikeets sitting outside their nest box.
Fearing that it was flooded I entered the aviary and saw the two eggs
for the first time. They v/ere reposing in a puddle of water! I added
a handful of peat to the bare concave bottom of their Budgerigar
nest box and plugged in the incubator, in case they should decide not
to return. This is a good insurance that it will not be needed and
they returned almost immediately to continue incubation !
On 29th August I was surprised to hear very faint squeaks coming
from the Fairy Lorikeets' aviary; these were heard again the follow-
ing day. On 4th September I suspected that the chick or chicks had
died. Inspection the next day revealed one egg and a dead chick which
I judged to be about six days old. It had a few wisps of white down
but was very discoloured, and by the time examination was carried
out it was not possible to discover the cause of death.
Success at the first attempt was more than I could hope for, but
the failure was, to me, one of considerable interest.
Finally, among the unsuccessful lories, a pair of Edwards's Lori-
keets which had bred in the past, had several clutches without result.
The various disappointments with the lories were, to a degree,
offset by the rearing of a Dusky Lory Pseudeos fuscata. The pair,
imported in 1973, are of the bright orange phase and very beautiful.
They nested twice in 1974; in each case one chick hatched but lived
for a very short time, probably not more than two days.
In 1975 the hen laid her first clutch near the beginning of April;
the nest was not inspected because the hen is rather nervous while
incubating. Even for lories they are a most devoted pair and the male
spends long periods inside the nest box while the hen is incubating.
A chick was heard on 10th May but lived for only two days.
The hen laid again at the beginning of June and a chick was heard
on 28th June. On 2nd July it was still alive so I added Horlick's and
wheat germ breakfast cereal to the nectar (otherwise the diet was as
described for the Meyer's Lorikeets). A few days later I gave bread
and milk; the bread was ignored but the milk was lapped up. Milk
was then given daily during the time the chick was in the nest and
was taken eagerly on most days. While the chick was very young,
pears were in season and every day soft ripe pear was offered. The
Dusky Lories semed anxious to get at the millet sprays provided for
the Meyer's in the next aviary and, to my surprise, when I offered
them some they ate it instead of destroying it as they had done in
the past. No other foods were taken during the rearing period.

From the time the chick was two weeks old the parents spent very
little time in the nest box. The weather was warm and continued very
warm until about a week before the chick fledged on 3rd September.
I could make only the scantiest notes on its development, as it was
not possible to see the whole floor area of the nest box and often
only part of the chick would be in view. On 20th July, when the
chick was three weeks old, I saw it preening itself. A week later I
noted in my diary that it had "some colour on the head with a halo
of fluff". Its body resembled a "white-grey ball of fluff". On 2nd
August, the orange feathers on its breast were apparent and four
days later I noticed that it was almost fully feathered on the head
and back, with down remaining on the breast and rump. On 14th
August, it seemed to have been plucked slightly on the wing butts
and there was little down apparent. By 23rd August it was fully and
perfectly feathered.
On fledging, its colours differed markedly from those of the adults.
In place of the clear bands of colour on the breast it had almost
the entire breast bright orange with a smudge of dark brown across
the upper breast where the adult has a clear band. Each feather on
the wings had a bronzy, almost iridescent centre, and the orange
patch on the outer web of each tail feather was far brighter than that
of the adults. The rump was almost golden in colour, brighter than that
of the male; the female's rump is nearer white.
Of course the most striking feature of the young lory's appearance
was the dark brown eye and beak, instead of the ruby-red eye and
the deep orange beak of the adult. This gave the young bird a most
gentle, appealing look; the bright eye of the adult is of piercing
intensity.
On fledging, it was considerably smaller than the hen but within
two v/eeks it had equalled her size, which is markedly less than that
of the male.
A pair of Eclectus which reared one youngster last year were again
successful. The hen is a particularly beautiful bird and belongs, I
believe, to the race vosmaeri. It is necessary to remove the male when
the pair are not breeding, as the hen will not tolerate him and would,
I fear, kill him if this precaution was not taken. The pair were re-
united on 12th January and the first of two eggs was laid on the 29th,
The hen never incubates for longer than 32 days; she seems to be
well aware when her eggs do not contain live chicks. After this
period she prepares the nest for the next clutch and the eggs disappear.
This happened on 1st March; on the 18th she laid again, and again
the two eggs failed to hatch. In an attempt to provide the correct
humidity, the nest box is always hosed while the hen is sitting.
The first egg of the third clutch was laid on 6th May and a chick
was heard on 3rd June. Both birds are very tame and, fortunately,

do not resent nest inspection. Brief notes made on the development
of the chick may be of interest.
12th June: Three times as large as on 7th June; now looks dark
(not pink and shiny) due to dark feather tracts covering body. Eyes
closed. Crop bulging. 17th June: now has dark blue appearance.
Eyes closed. 19th June : eyes open. 21st June : now covered in dark
bluish-black down. 24th June : stands upright on haunches. Covered
with close dark down like a baby penguin.
On 29th June the presence of green feathers on the mantle indicated
its sex : male. On 3rd July I opened the nest box when the male was
inside and saw him preening the chick's head; he continued to do
this for about three minutes. This is interesting because I have never
seen adult birds preen each other. I watched the male preen the
chick's head on other occasions; the chick did not enjoy this atten-
tion and would move its head away. On 20th July I noticed that
it was slightly plucked on the nape.
On 6th July, several lines of green quills, half an inch long, were
visible on the wings and mantle, with shorter quills on the tail and
head. On the 12th the head and wings were three-quarters covered
with green feathers.
On the 26th the young Eclectus was becoming quite noisy. It was
seen looking out the nest hole on 2nd August and, in fact, spent long
periods thereafter looking out until it fledged on 23rd August. Every
time my husband or I passed the aviary we would speak to the young
bird; consequently, when he fledged he was not at all nervous--
unlike last year's youngster. The latter was never seen to look out of
the nest and when it left it was so nervous it injured its leg crashing
about the aviary. It was therefore removed to a cage indoors as soon
as it was independent. For weeks it was quite unapproachable but
now, a year later, it is very noisy and tame and will gently nibble
at my nose.
Rearing of the chick, from the time it is a few days old, is carried
out almost entirely by the male. Principal rearing food is corn on
the cob, fresh or frozen--depending on the season. A variety of other
vegetables is offered but little interest is shown, although some celery
and tomato is taken; also cheese, in addition to some seed when the
chick is a few weeks old. Fruit, taken at other times, is ignored.
It was necessary to remove the male shortly after the young bird
fledged as the hen had started to chase and bully him. He was
returned on 6th September, when the youngster was removed, and
nesting again took place, but the single egg was deserted on 14th
December. It was found to contain an almost fully developed chick.
A second pair of Eclectus also have eggs. Their very first clutch,
the first egg of which was laid on 6th August, did not hatch. In
1974, their first year together, they were not compatible and it was

necessary to remove the male for long periods. I am hoping to es-
tablish two separate breeding lines of Eclectus Parrots; all the young
will be retained for breeding.
Two pairs of true parrots which nested for the first time produced
chicks, although in neither case were these reared. The beautiful
Purple-bellied Parrot Triclaria malachitacea from Brazil is very rare
in captivity and has, I believe, never been bred outside its native
country. The hen of my pair unfortunately died in 1973 and I had
little hope of obtaining a replacement. However, in April, the un-
expected happened, when American members Mr. and Mrs. T.
Nichols very generously sent me a female.
On being introduced, on 13th April, both birds seemed equally
delighted, but nevertheless, the male obviously felt it necessary, right
from the start, to show who was in charge. He immediately flew at
the hen and gave her a brief pecking but she showed no fear of him
at all, in fact, she followed him about the aviary and in a short while
mutual preening took place.
Three days later, mating was observed and the following day, 17 th
April, the hen v/as seen to enter the nest box. She did not lay until
nearly four weeks later, probably on 12th May. When I inspected
the nest on the 17 th there were two normal eggs (approximately
31 mm. long) and one which measured only 20 mm. The laying of
one of these eggs, probably on 15th May, appeared to cause some
difficulty; the hen spent much of the day in the aviary looking
decidedly ill. At 7 p.m. she was still sitting in the flight so I very
reluctantly decided she must be caught up and given the benefit of
an infra-red lamp. I went away to get the catching net and, on
my return, found to my relief that she had at last entered the nest
box. Henceforth she seemed quite well but my worries were not over;
the male did not enter the nest and during the early days of incu-
bation the hen frequently came out of the box to beg food from him.
He failed to realise what was required of him and the hen was seen
feeding herself.
On 14th June a chick hatched; this gave a minimum incubation
period of 29 days. The male was seen searching the flight almost
frantically for something which we could not provide. We gave all kinds
of extras, including a tray of seedlings of canary seed, planted a few
days previously. The male showed much interest in this and appeared
to be eating the earth.
On 16th June the chick died. Autopsy revealed a septic navel cord,
an infection which is very common in chicks of domestic poultry. On
removing the chick from the nest I noticed that the tiny upper mandible
had been injured, almost certainly by the hen when the chick failed
to respond to her attempts to feed it, I imagine.
The pair made no further attempt to nest during 1975.

On 1st June a pair of Bronze-winged Parrots Pionus chalcopterus
were removed to a very small temporary aviary, as their aviary was
required for other birds. The aviary had no shelter and was com-
pletely open, the only protection being provided by the wall which
formed the lower half of the back, the solid partition dividing it
from the adjoining aviary and a piece of asbestos placed above one
perch.
The hen had been housed in this aviary with another hen Bronze-
winged during the winter, and had shown great interest in the nest
box it contained. On being placed in this apology for an aviary she
went to nest almost immediately; the first egg was probably laid on
17th June. Because of the smallness of the aviary and the fact that
the hen is very nervous, the nest was not inspected.
On 15th July, the sounds of a chick or chicks were heard--a distinc-
tive quavering noise. All kinds of extras were provided, including sponge
cake and nectar, a softfood which I make up, the main ingredients of
which are crushed biscuits, a protein baby cereal and honey, and
fresh vegetables such as celery, green peas and runner beans, in
addition to the usual foods--canary and sunflower seed, pine nuts,
peanuts, spray millet and apple. Corn on the cob was ignored.
On 23rd August, the hen Bronze-wing was seen in the aviary for
the first time, except for the occasion when she had been alarmed
by a downpour of tropical intensity. It was obvious that something
had gone wrong. The nest was inspected for the first time and re-
vealed a dead chick, over five weeks old, a very small, decomposed
chick and one egg; the latter measured about 34 mm. long and
25 mm. wide--considerably larger than that of the Purple-bellied.
The chick's beak and some nails had been torn off and one of its
legs was injured. Its crop was full and it was naked except for the
greenish-bronze secondaries; its body was reminiscent of that of a
macaw chick. It was about one third the size of an adult.
The weather at the time was very hot; when the chick was found
it was too late for an autopsy to be carried out. This was regrettable
because it might have provided a clue as to whether the chick was
mutilated after death, or whether its injuries were responsible for
its death. The male Bronze-wing was never seen to enter the nest;
he invariably fed the hen at the entrance hole. The hen appeared
to be an extremely conscientious parent. Had some outside dis-
turbance, a cat perhaps, caused her to kill the chick? Or did it die
from natural causes? Aviculture is full of unsolved mysteries.
Finally, a pair of Grey Parrots Psittacus erithacus laid before
(mid May) and after (mid July) the moult. In both cases the eggs
disappeared after a few days. This was puzzling and disappointing
because last year, the pair's first together, fertile eggs had been
produced in the single clutch laid which was incubated for the full

Aratinga solstitialis
By N. Ramen (Goxhill, Barrow-on-Humber)
In October, 1974, I bought two Sun Conures, and not until the end
of November of the same year did they give any indication of being
a pair. I began to think they were two males as both birds seemed
identical by form, colour and shape of beak and head. Finally in
February, 1975, I saw them attempting to mate. Mating was unusual:
unlike Old World parrakeets both birds stay on the perch when
mating. At this time they were in an indoor aviary 3 ft. x 6 ft. flight
with the grandfather clock type nest box, facing north.
In April, 1975, they were placed in an outside flight approximately
11 ft. long, 3 ft. wide and 9 ft. high; enclosed shelter was accessible.
Both the east and west sides of the aviary were protected by perspex
sheeting, as was half the roof. The nest box from indoor flight was
useless, as the birds had almost chewed their way out. I made a
similar box 18 ins. x 18 ins. square and 4^ ft. long. At the bottom
of the box 6 ins. of peat mixed with dried grass was placed. This
time a few small pieces of wood were left on the peat in the hope that
the birds would chew diem instead of the box, as they had pre-
viously done. Both birds slept inside at night. I noticed after a week
that the wood placed in the bottom of the nest had all been chewed
and a type of nest had been made in one corner of the box. This
nest entrance was facing south.
On 4th July, I noticed a large swelling had appeared under the
abdomen of the hen bird. I was worried, but kept careful watch over
the birds. On the 6th July, 1975, I noticed the lump had disappeared.
I realised what could have happened, and correctly, for the first
egg was laid. I was so pleased. Three more eggs were laid at two-
day intervals, and each time the coming egg was, of course, indicated
by the swelling.
The incubation period was 27 days. The first chick was hatched
on the 3rd August, looking bare, and the three other eggs hatched
at two-day intervals. Only the hen incubated the eggs although the
cock did assist in feeding the young. As I have very little knowledge

of these birds, a varied diet was their menu. I was much surprised to
find that large amounts of bread and milk mixed with dog biscuit
in a porridge form, apples and egg and biscuit mixture were taken
in the first three weeks. Mixed sunflower seeds and hemp were taken
in small quantities. After three weeks the sunflower seed, hemp and
apples given were never enough, but the soft food taken was re-
duced in quantity to that previously taken. Frequent inspections of
the nest were made, with the minimum of disturbance to the birds,
right from the day the first egg was laid. I found that, as I ap-
proached the nest, the cock bird flew to the box, climbed down by
the hen, looked vicious and ready to attack and he made a lot of
noise. One problem was how to ring the young, for I could never get
near them and I had to catch both parents and put them into a cage
before I could do the ringing which was done at five-day intervals
from hatching.
All four thrived and pictures were taken of them at varying inter-
vals so as to record their progress. On the 22nd September the first
young one came out of the nest and within two days all four were
out. They were almost identical to their parents, differing only in the
colouring of the wings and backs which were mostly green, whereas
in the adult these areas are deep orange with only the wing tips
green. I noticed how quickly the young ones learned to fly and to
recognise their surroundings.
I have found that I have taken twice as long to feed the birds each
day and that is because I have spent hours watching the Sun Gonures
and their family which are beautiful, strong and healthy at present.

The Cockatiel Nymphicus hollandicus
After the Budgerigar, the Cockatiel must be the most commonly
captive-bred parrot and it is now sufficiently domesticated for it to
have four established colour mutations. Each of these "New colours"
depends for its effect upon some inherent interference in the deposi-
tion, or the nature, of melanin : pied, lutino (albino), laced (pearled)
and cinnamon (isabelle).
When I acquired my American-imported Cockatiels in March 1969
I could not have given much serious thought to them beforehand
because I immediately saw tiiat they were lutino and not, as adver-
tised, albino. Not that they could have been otherwise for it would
take a second mutation to produce white by stripping them of their
ability to make yellow and orange pigments. Since that time lutino
Cockatiels have become commonplace. I kept Cockatiels for six years
but somehow never developed any real liking for them and, being
always short of accommodation, I no longer have any.
General behaviour
Cockatiels are sociable birds and several breeding pairs may be
housed in the same large aviary provided that they have a surplus of
identical nestboxes. The crest, which signals alarm or aggressive
intent, normally rests fairly close to the head; during squabbles it is
always raised. These, the smallest of the cockatoos, never sit in direct
physical contact: should even members of a mated pair touch they
begin to bicker at each other until a few centimetres lie between them
once again.
Irrespective of their sex, all Cockatiels will preen one another, but
it is more frequently observed between members of mated pairs. A
Cockatiel preening itself on the wings, back or tail does not generally
attract the attention of others, for the head is held high. But when
grooming the throat, chest or abdomen where the head is held (sub-
missively) low, then an adjacent Cockatiel is very likely to sidle over
and attempt to get itself preened by the grooming bird. It does this by
adopting the meekest of approaches : the crest is held tight to the scalp,
making it almost imperceptible, the eyes are part-closed and the head is
held very low. In this attitude it will nudge the preening bird gently
with its closed bill. Should this not get immediate attention, then it
repeats the nudging again and again until it does. Eventually the
preening bird will pause in its grooming and look around to see who
interrupts it and is then confronted by this most abjectly postured
Cockatiel. To give a vicious peck or take offence at such a contrite-

looking bird as the interruptor is simply not done; and the peck is dis-
armed into a preen and once it starts to preen the other, it usually
continues for some minutes, the bird being preened slowly moving its
head to direct the preening bird's bill into fresh areas. If the preening
should stop, it will renudge to start it off once again or until the other
Gockatiel flies off for peace and quiet. Cockatiels very keen to be
preened will solicit from non-preening birds by the same contrite
nudging methods.
Males, when they are not partnered, are rather fidgety beings and
any movement attracts their attention. It is therefore very likely that
they will notice any preening bird and will fly over to try and beg a
preen and this is how, I believe, pairs become introduced to one
another. If the preening bird is another male or a mated hen, then
these unmated males would be signalled off by crest raising and, if
necessary, by pecking.
Like cockatoos, Cockatiels seemingly do not bathe in standing water
in the usual way of ducking the head under and splashing droplets
on to the back with fluttering wings. Instead they stand or sit in the
water for some minutes, then when thoroughly soaked on the belly,
they fly off dripping wet. This is not usually seen except when they
are breeding and I take it that this is a method of increasing the
humidity of the nest.
Cockatiels also shower-bathe (Harrison 1961) in falling rain when
they become ecstatically excited and fly from one end of the aviary to
another calling noisily. When they settle, they spread the wings and
tail to catch the raindrops. The bird teeters over to hold itself out-
wards and downwards from the perch with the outspread wings held
forwards. It does seem that the noise of falling rain can set off rain-
bathing, for as I was hammering, a caged Cockatiel, hearing this,
leant over in a rain-bathing attitude. More usually the stimulation
seems to be a sudden change in the light: the darkness accompanying
a storm. This rain-bathing reaction to changes in the intensity of light
would explain why Cockatiels leaving the nest box spread-eagle them-
selves upside down from the exit perch; and when leaving the darkness
of the aviary shelter or when in a room that is suddenly made bright by
turning on the light. This identical stance is taken by Palm Cockatoos
Probosciger aterrimus at dawn. This was believed by Forshaw (1969) to
be a form of courtship : it could, of course, also be a reaction to the
sudden increase in light intensity.
The extreme excitement generated by rain-bathing might be
important in triggering off breeding in these semi-desert birds. In 1974
we had a 12-week drought. When the rains came in early July both my
pairs, which until then had had no interest in breeding, began to
investigate the nest boxes and soon laid and this was not an exceptional
observation.

Cockatiels noticeably prefer to rest on bare branches; I had to snip
the leaves off their fresh perches before they would come out of the
shelter.
They ate little fruit; sometimes they chewed at apple and they
were very fond of greenfood; otherwise they lived on seed. When
breeding they would avidly take bread steeped in milk, and cuttlebone.
Compared with most parrots, Cockatiels are very poor climbers and
I have never seen them walking upside down from the aviary roof, nor
can they lean right over to pick something up immediately under the
perch. Unless an ear of corn or a millet spray were accidently turned
over, the grains on the underside were untouched.
Cockatiels, and especially young Cockatiels, as they walked over the
floor, picked up small pieces of vegetation in the bill which they
spiralled and twisted by chewing at one end. It was practically impos-
sible to find moulted feathers whose quills had not been splintered by
this. One Cockatiel, seeing another twirling something in its bill, would
often try to steal this toy.
I had always believed that Cockatiels were unable to use their feet
as hands until I saw one youngster trying to take hold with its foot of
a piece of grass that it was twirling in its beak. The grasping actions it
made were so hopelessly uncoordinated that, although it very often
tried, only once was it seen to clasp the grass between its foot and the
perch. Once it lost this grip, it was never again seen to repeat this
success in the dozens of times, both that day and following, that I saw
it try. It was, therefore, a complete surprise when I found that I had
an immature pied male which could hold things in its foot and I con-
tinually regret disposing of him, for it would have been particularly
interesting to see if this unique ability had any genetic basis.
Breeding
In my experience both sexes will breed once they are eight months
old and I know r of some which raised young when they were five
months old. Although Cockatiels come from the deserts of Australia
and therefore, like the Budgerigar and Zebra Finch, are presumably
adapted to breed at any season of the year, they are not entirely
liberated from the influence of day-length. The moult is the invariable
late summer one of parrots and during this time they are less inclined
to breed. Those pairs which do so frequently become lackadaisical
about brooding and feeding, and loss of eggs and young are high, but
by mid-September most males, including the current year ones, are in
full song and display.
The Cockatiel is an example of those few species of parrot in which
the male can produce a mechanical noise by rapping the top of the
beak against a "sounding board". The resulting sound is not as loud
and far slower than that made by woodpeckers. Objects rapped include
the inside and outside of the nest box and the perches in the near

vicinity of the nest. Not every male taps and this is interspersed
between singing by very sexually excited individuals. Apart from the
Cockatiel I have heard Budgerigar, Many-coloured, Red-rumped and
Ring-neck Parrakeets Psittacula krameri beak-rapping. The only
reference that I can find is for the Noble Macaw Ara nobilis (Brown

Whether they have nesting facilities or not, sexually active males
display; they fly up and down whistling a loud, far-carrying coo-ee }
coo-ee . . . and settle with the crest lowered and with open wings;
this posture is maintained for a few seconds; they then whistle coo-ee ,
coo-ee 3 coo-ee 3 give a slight shake to the feathers of the head and body
and rapidly fly off, again calling. Although the whistle is such a simple
disyllabic noise, it was easy for me to identify which of my four males
was calling. A calling male usually performs alone, as other males seem
indifferent.
When on the ground, males will closely follow their mates, punctuat-
ing their walk with little vertical jumps, the whole accompanied by
warbling. As the crest is sometimes raised, it appears that they are ill
at ease courting on the ground. A perched male courts by approaching
with lowered head, the crest tight against the scalp and the wings lifted
up so that the back and wings form a flat heart-shaped surface with
the tips of the wings touching. Except for the position of the wings,
this is the same cringing attitude taken when begging a preen; how-
ever, when courting, he chortles a mixture of whistling song and the
male coo-ee 3 coo-ee. The sexes may look entirely different to us but
this might not have much relevance for Cockatiels, as it is noticed that
an unpaired male will sexually approach other males apparently just
as readily as females and it also seems to make no difference whether
they are abnormally coloured, such as pied or lutino. However, if the
bird serenaded is male or a disinterested female, then it will raise its
crest and if the courting male persists it will be threatened with an
open beak and an angry whine. It is usual for females to remain still
and it is their mate which drives away the other male. The tolerance
towards courting males shown by the females and the preening of the
head, which soon follows courtship, contribute to establishing the pair-
bond and after only a few days of forming a pair the female usually
will be soliciting for copulation. Copulation continues through the
incubation and rearing of the brood and is probably also pair-bonding
in function.
A female solicits by lowering herself down on the perch with wings
slightly away from the body and the back perfectly horizontal. The
crest is depressed with head slightly to one side. The pairing male,
singing away, slowly steps on to her back with both feet and his song
then becomes a silent mouthing. He lowers his tail to one side and
copulation takes place. As his head slightly bobs during mating, it

might from a distance, look as though he were feeding the hen. Pairing
is a lengthy business and usually takes several minutes. The side of the
bird is not changed and the hen keeps up a continual squealing noise
which carries for a distance of 20 yards or so. Other males, even if
sitting on the same perch, appear totally disinterested.
When a nest box is given to a sexually active pair, they usually
begin to examine the entrance hole a few minutes afterwards. The male
displays and twitters at the hole as he does when courting a hen. After
one or two false starts he soon takes courage to enter and once inside,
he continues to sing and beak-tap. It is not too long before the hen
enters after him and there is much to-and-froing. They seem to give
less attention to the floor of the nest than is customary with parrots;
I doubt that either sex scratch the litter with their feet, but some wood
is chewed from the walls and around the entrance hole.
Like so many (all?) of the white cockatoos, Gockatiels have no court-
ship feeding : this may be because the male shares equally in incuba-
tion and brooding. Once a pair-bond is established, it is amazing just
how soon the first egg can appear after the introduction of a nest box.
One record of mine gives three days and I have nine instances where
there was only a four-day interval. Likewise when chicks are removed
it is possible for the replacement clutch to start after only four days.
As it takes an ovum (yolk) two days from the time that it is released
from the ovary, before it is laid as a shelled egg, this practically spon-
taneous ovulation after entering a nesting chamber is physiologically
somewhat remarkable. Firstly because Gockatiels are "determinate
layers" (that is removing the eggs as they are laid does not increase
the overall size of the clutch) and secondly because it indicates that
when not laying, mature ova must be continually present in the ovary.
A further feature, better known in game birds, is the longevity of
sperm in the female's reproductive tract. I have recorded several
examples of this and it is particularly well illustrated by the following.
A hen lutino Cockatiel paired to another lutino laid her first egg, of a
fertile clutch of five, 20 days after she had been separated from a
normally coloured grey male. The resulting five chicks were grey,
showing that the lutino male could not have been their father. Indeed,
later attempts at breeding from him proved that he was incapable of
fertilising eggs because he would face the wrong direction when tread-
ing a hen.
The first egg is usually laid the very night that a hen is first seen to
roost inside the nest box. When she is laying, a hen spends most of her
time brooding : this makes it easy to prejudge the final number of eggs
composing a clutch by halving the number of days that the male is
seen sitting outside waiting his opportunity to brood. Certain females
can become broody without seemingly being able to lay. If these hens
are given eggs the pair begin to sit (Marriot 1970) and when the chicks

have fledged, the hen usually lays normally. The average size of a
clutch appears to be five; but I have found numbers between one and
10. The average weight for 44 fresh eggs was 6.5 grams (ranging
between 6 and 6.9 grams), about a 13th of the weight of the laying hen.
A Cockatiel about to take over the incubation of eggs enters the
nest and, without any observable ceremony or noise, sits down next to
the already incubating bird. They may brood together for a while,
each taking part of the clutch; more typically, as one sits the other
gets up and leaves the nest. The only occasion when Gockatiels sit
physically touching one another is when sharing incubation and it
might well be that it is to avoid this physical contact that one gets
up as the other sits down. As with pigeons, the male sits for most of
the daylight hours and the female at night; however, occasional
females will do all of the incubation. The males always roost outside
the nest at night; when emerging from the nest entrance they move
with extreme stealth and if they feel that they are being watched
"freeze" with the head lowered and if not too far out slink backwards,
where they remain until the coast is clear.
The shortest and by far the most frequent incubation period is 19
days (49 clutches of individually marked eggs). This is the same num-
ber of days as I have found for the other ground-feeding genera of
Australasian parrots: Platycercus , Barnardius, Purpureicephalus ,
Cyanoramphus , Psepholus , Neophema, Aprosmictus , Alisterus, Poly-
telis. Budgerigars take 18 days. As the eggs begin to hatch, the parents
become loath to leave the nest and then can often be found together.
The eggs hatch as they were laid, at roughly two-day intervals.
Curiously for parrots some egg-shells are removed from the nest--I do
not know how--the rest get broken up by the movements of the birds.
On hatching, the young are moderately clothed with strands of
yellow down (Pycroft 1907). The intensity of the yellow is genetically
determined and pale yellow chicks make pale yellow adults and vice-
versa. In a well-reared clutch the eyes start to open at seven or eight
days old, but can be delayed for three more days. It does sound, from
the gentle cheeping noises they make when being fed, that this takes
place very frequently at first; perhaps several times an hour. Examina-
tion of post-mortem material shows that the parents give the young
crop-softened seed, grit and what appears to be saliva but could, from
its milky colour, also contain part-digested food from the stomach.
Contrary to popular belief, parrots do not, like pigeons, have crop
glands which secrete "milk". As the chicks begin to age and feather,
the food-soliciting noise that they make takes on a harsher, almost
snarling quality.
The most obvious part of a Cockatiel chick's anatomy is the
enormous gizzard which fairly bulges under the transparent skin of the
abdomen. When the eldest chicks are about 10 days old and their

voice noticeably changes, the parents start to leave them unbrooded
for some of the day; however, the hen continues to brood each night
until they fledge. Very young chicks when disturbed merely clamour to
be fed; however, once they can see, they rock, hissing angrily, from
side to side : the hiss is a short sharp exhalation, with the crest raised
to its maximum. Hissing is very contagious and even "blind" young-
sters of three or four days old will do this when they hear it from the
older ones.
The chicks fledge at about 35 days old; however, Mr. D. G. Marriot,
who also keeps a daily record of each brood, had one extremely pre-
cocious nest which fledged at 28 days. Very frequently, before they
leave the nest, the hen has started on her second clutch and it has been
my experience that this second clutch is always laid in the same box.
When egg-laying starts before the previous round of chicks have left,
they frequently get badly chewed by both parents : removing the
chicks to the safety of the shelter stops this and the parents still con-
tinue to feed them. Unlike small passerines, the chicks in the shelter
cluster in one spot and do not fly until their normal time. A fledged
chick solicits for food by lowering the crest and bobbing the lowered
head and whining. Like other Old World parrots, with which I am
experienced, and contrary to New World forms, they do not flap the
wings when they are being fed.
Chicks are probably not fully independent of their parents for a
fortnight to three weeks. It is noticed that parents which have stopped
plucking their young, because they were taken from the nest, will
often start to pluck them again once they start perching near to the
nest box.
Young males start their singing of coo-ee, coo-ee , when they are
about 30 days out of the nest.
The Abyssinian (or Black-winged) Lovebird Agapornis taranta
I have a small colony of four Abyssinian Lovebirds, each of which
is identifiable at a glance. The males are abnormally coloured and
were wild-caught. One, which previously belonged to Mr. W. Howarth,
is a cinnamon, having pale brown instead of black melanin. The face is
orange and the body feathers are light green. The most curious feature
is that, although the general body plumage, including the terminal
band across the tail, is cinnamon, the "signalling" black of the primary
wing-coverts and that of the under wing-coverts are the coal-black
usual in male Abyssinian Lovebirds. The production of melanin in
these covert feathers must therefore be under a separate genetic control.
The other male, though he has since moulted out normal except for
his orange face, was pied. A few of his flight feathers were cinnamon
and the piedness involved most of the back, the head, one wing and
some of the belly feathers. The largest hen, which is very tame, has

a small group of three or four yellow feathers on the nape and is paired
to the cinnamon; the smaller, perfectly normal hen, is mated to the
pied male.
The pairs had been kept in separate cages long enough to have
formed permanent partnerships when, in late March 1974, they were
put into the same small aviary--6 x 4 x 7 feet high--attached to an
indoor shelter and four different-sized nest boxes were provided.
General behaviour
Dilger (i960) believed that those species of lovebird in which the
sexes are distinctive are not as sociable when breeding as those in
which the sexes look alike. My two pairs of Abyssinian Lovebirds
continue to breed in this small aviary in boxes less than a yard apart.
Nesting accommodation is very important for lovebird pairs : when
they are not breeding, the boxes provide a refuge by day and a warm
roost at night. Fortunately, on their release into the aviary, the hens
selected different boxes. The males had nothing to do with this choice
except for encouraging their mates, with excited twittering, to enter.
Just before the final choice of box was properly settled, a slight quarrel
took place and ended when the attacking hen was bitten on the face
and, as she flew off, accidently drew the rightful occupier out of the
entrance hole. The two parted before they hit the floor and the owner
was back inside her box in a second.
A hen defending from an entrance hole is practically invincible;
her body is protected and the invading lovebird is very reluctant to
enter without having had a careful preliminary survey, something that
she cannot very well do whilst the rightful owner remains inside.
Even when they are breeding (in the spring and summer) a large
amount of their time is spent bickering with other lovebirds. For
although they are reasonably sociable when feeding or foraging about
away from the nest boxes, the territory defended by the males is a
two foot area around their hen and they readily take offence at what
they consider to be trespass in this area. When they are breeding, this
territory, for all intents and purposes, is for much of the time the area
around the nest box. Dilger has described how, when one male is about
to attack another, it will flick its wings from the sides of its body. He
calls this "carpal flashing 35 and it causes the male flicked at to fly off on
seeing, as he does, the black undersides of the other's wings. I have not
seen carpal flashing, for it appears that mine are not so lily-livered as
to merely indicate that they might fly off in pursuit, but actually do so.
I have not seen a serious fight, for they obey certain "rules". A male,
for example, seldom if ever attacks a female and females usually only
war with other hens. The pair-bond is very strong and the females are
the larger and stronger sex. When the wives quarrel, the males demon-
strate their own anger by flaring their tails, chattering and lunging
with the bill and yet noticeably take very good care not to get within

striking distance of the opposing hen. A hen may be practically
invincible inside her nest box but outside of it their invincibility to
other Abyssinian Lovebird females diminishes the further away they
are. One hen chased by another flies to its nest hole and pursuit usually I
stops even before it needs to enter. And, so much for sexual equality, it
is the wives who provide sanctuary to their husbands against attacks
by other males. A male bullied by another can divert the attack simply
by flying up to the side of his wife, when the other male promptly shies
off. Such a husband-protecting hen is so dominant to mere males that
she seems barely to notice who has chased her partner back to the
protection of her petticoats.
It seems to me that when the pairs groom one another they do not
do so with the careful, almost considerate, caressing of conures but
often with rather spiteful little pecks that, from the reactions of the
birds, must sometimes hurt. The area that they groom is mainly the
forehead and throat although they sometimes attempt to preen other
parts of the body : when they do so this is always met with anger. In
some cases the feathers of the face and lores are stripped bare by the
vigour of this preening, whereas in Manycolours and Redrumps it is
usually the feathers at the back of the head which suffer.
I have not seen Abyssinian Lovebirds hanging upside down to roost,
as reported by Dilger. They bathe fairly frequently and mb them-
selves on wet foliage, but have neither been seen to rain-bathe nor bask
in the sun.
Breeding
The cinnamon pair very soon changed their large box for a smaller,
more appropriate one. The hen showed her nervous stress when exam-
ining the entrance hole to this fresh box by exaggeratedly flicking her
head and flaring the tail as she poked her head inside. After a good
many minutes of retreat and advance she finally plucked up courage
and entered to examine the inside of the box. While this was going on,
the male excitedly hung outside and poked his head into the hole
through which his wife had just disappeared, but did not dare to
follow. As the hen re-emerged she flicked her head (always a sign of
very great excitement) and gave a rather harshly unpleasant ee, ee }
ee. . . . Then she slipped back inside once more flaring her tail at entry.
After each emergence she now clung to the wire running over the
front of the box, flicking her head and uttering her ee, ee, ee . . . how-
ever now and again pausing to solicit food from the male, as do fledg-
ling youngsters, by bobbing her head up and down while noisily
squeaking. The male, quite as excited as his mate, fed her with such
an eager enthusiasm that he seemed positively thankful at being :
allowed to do something for himself. When she eventually flew off,
he entered the box for his first time, stayed for only a second or two

and continued as before.
The incubating hen, rather disturbed by this noisy activity of claim-
ing a nest site, came off her eggs and putting her head well outside her
nest hole showed her annoyance by flicking her head and making
clicking noises, apparently by gnashing the mandibles together.
Prior to the pair with the cinnamon male establishing themselves in
their much smaller box, the male used to be somewhat harassed by the
pied male; however, once they had moved in, his dominance rapidly
rose over the other : this change happened in only a few days.
Copulation is a long process and is usually preceded by the hen
pleading to be fed, as usual, by head-bobbing and squeaking. The male
moves his head in a fidgety sort of way and the copulating side is
changed several times.
Neither of the two hens took much nesting material into the boxes,
but there were masses of feathers, some of which, by their colour, must
have been plucked from the males. Each hen laid only three eggs; the
largest clutch since has been four, and the incubation period was 25
days.
The chicks are very helpless, and although they are thickly downed,
this is not wispy and long as in most parrots but is short and looks not
unlike clipped cotton wool. They are all head and neck when hatched,
with a minute white-downed body; the ear is represented by a pin-
hole opening. They grow very, very slowly and at a week old are still
very embryonic-looking. The male goes into the box to feed the hen
and one can easily make out her food-soliciting call and the chicks,
despite their very small size, have quite surprisingly loud voices even
from the first day. The eyes did not open until they were, at the very
earliest, 15 days old; however it was usually several days later than
this and some youngsters still had one eye sealed shut when three weeks
old. Generally one eye opens well before the other and gentle prising
in these tardy eyes seems unable to force the lids apart. Once the eyes
have started to open, the parents stop brooding the chicks over the day.
The earliest that I have had chicks fledge is at 52 days old. As Dilger
reports, young males have just an odd tiny red feather somewhere
about the head, making it possible to distinguish them from juvenile
females.
Considering just what quarrelsome little beasts Abyssinian Lovebirds
are, it was amazing how extremely tolerant the parents remain to their
offspring, long, long after they are mature. For example, at one point
I had father and two nine-month old sons sharing the same box in
which the hen incubated a round of eggs. When they hatched, all
three males contributed in feeding the chicks. The three males clumped
together when the hen was not about---otherwise the father clumped
with the hen--and preened and fed each other in perfect amicability.
I feel almost certain that had one of these sons been a daughter, then

their parents' nest site. As I seem completely unable to breed anything
but male Abyssinian Lovebirds, I have been unable to work out the
genetics of the cinnamon and pied males.

OBSERVATIONS ON A FEMALE LONG-TAILED HERMIT
HUMMINGBIRD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.96344352" page_id="56381627"  page_num="32" year="" vol="">
By A. J. Mobbs (Walsall, West Midlands)
The Long-tailed Hermit Phaethornis superciliosus has a wide distri-
bution and can be found in Mexico, through the whole of Central
America and parts of South America including Colombia, Ecuador,
Peru, Bolivia, Venezuela, Brazil, Guyana, Surinam and French Guiana.
Peters (1945) lists 14 subspecies, only one of which is somewhat
doubtful.
As many of the Phaethornis are much alike in appearance, it is
difficult to estimate how many Long-tailed Hermits have been brought
into Britain over the years. At one time all "hermits" ( Glaucis , Phae-
thornis and Threnetes --the latter often being given the name "hermit",
although their common name is barbthroat) were considered extremely
difficult to establish in captivity; this plus their so-called drab appear-
ance has not helped their popularity as avicultural subjects and because
of this, most importers have always fought shy of such birds.
At one time the difficulties experienced with these birds were attri-
buted to their supposed highly insectivorous nature. However, this
theory has been proved incorrect by observations made on birds both in
the wild and in confinement; as, in point of fact, there are a number of
species far more insectivorous, yet prove fairly easy to establish.
In my opinion, the main reasons hermits prove difficult to establish,
is that not only are they poor travellers, but that they also find difficulty
accepting a captive diet. Friends of mine who have, under licence,
taken Phaethornis species in their country of origin, have found that,
given a substantial diet from the moment of capture, these birds can

stand up to the rigours of the journey to Europe. Many hummingbirds
trapped commercially, are given sugar water only and therefore reach
their destination in a weakened state, especially when delayed in transit
or when held over by the trappers before being shipped.
The female Long-tailed Hermit on which these notes are based, was
purchased on the 9th February, 1972. It was placed into a large flight
cage for observation and after four days, was released into my com-
munal hummingbird flight. After being in the flight for one day only,
the hermit had to be removed due to the extreme belligerence shown
to it by a male Andean Emerald Amazilia franciae viridiceps. Two
days later, the hermit was again released into the flight and has
remained in the enclosure ever since.

Moults
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982960192307692" page_id="56381628"  page_num="33" year="" vol="">
The hermit's first moult in captivity began on the 8th May, 1972,
and was completed by the 8th July : 13 weeks. The second moult was
from the 18th July, 1973 to 25th October : 14 weeks. The third moult
began on the 2nd August, 1974 and was completed by the nth
October : 10 weeks. All moults were completed without complications.
Display activity
As is often the case with newly imported hummingbirds, the hermit
showed no inclination to display until it had completed a moult in
captivity. However, within a few days of completing the first moult, it
was seen to perform and since then has done so regularly except during
the annual moulting periods. As with the Reddish Hermit, P. ruber
(Mobbs 1971), the actual display is somewhat varied and can in fact
be divided into certain phases. I shall, therefore, describe each phase
separately.
(a) The hermit hovers in front of a perched hummingbird; the neck
is arched and the tail is brought under the body slightly. The hermit
then opens its beak and utters a loud churr-tok , at the same time snap-
ping the head and tail back into the normal position. This action may
be carried out three or four times.
Should the bird at which the display is being directed remain passive,
the hermit loses interest and flies away. However, should the perched
bird take to the wing or show aggression, the hermit will immediately
attack. This sudden onslaught is usually enough to rout the bird and
the hermit then gives chase, uttering loud chureks as it does so. The
hermit was seen to perform this display only a matter of days after
completing its first moult in captivity.

(b) As in (a) except that when the bird to which the display is being
directed remains passive, the hermit attempts to alight on its back.
(c) The hermit hovers directly in front of a perched hummingbird,
at the same time raising the crown feathers and extending those of
the throat. The beak is held upwards at an angle of approximately
72 degrees; the body is held in an upright position and the tail is held

downwards in line with the body. This attitude may be kept up for
io to 15 seconds at a time, especially if the perched bird remains
passive. However, it is rare for a bird at which the display is being
directed to remain passive, as the hermit usually persuades it to leave
the perch by hovering closer and closer. If the perched bird does leave,
the hermit may (i) chase after it, or (ii) alight on the perch itself and
commence to preen.
(d) As in (c) except that should the perched hummingbird remain
so, the hermit will fly to the rear of the bird and attempt to alight on
its back.
(e) The hermit alights on a perch near to (approximately 4-5 inches)
a perched hummingbird. It then turns its head toward the latter and
if there is no response, becomes agitated and commences to sidle along
the perch toward the perched bird (this sidling action is relatively fast
considering how small are the legs and feet). While moving along the
perch, the hermit fans the tail to the utmost and wags it up and down
in a most exaggerated manner, emphasis always being on the upward
movement. The wings are opened slightly and held a little away from
the body; they are then moved up and down and vibrated rapidly.
This particular action is very much like the wing action made by a
bathing bird except that it is more exaggerated.
During the whole of sequence (e), the hermit's body and throat
feathers are puffed out and the feathers of the crown are raised.
Although it is rare for a bird at which the display is being directed
to remain perched long enough for the hermit to approach nearer
than an inch or so, should the former remain perched, the hermit will
leave the perch and attempt to alight on the bird's back. Should, as is
usually the case, the perched bird take to the wing, the hermit ceases
to display immediately.
(f) The hermit sits with the tail held slightly higher than is normal
and fans it to the utmost, at the same time uttering loud chureks. This
can be kept up for as much as two minutes at a time. The hermit then
leaves its perch to hover in front of a perched hummingbird, holding
its beak open slightly and moving the body from side to side, after
which it carries out the churr-tok movements (see procedure (a)), and
then attempts to alight on the bird's back.
Nesting activity
Approximately two weeks after the hermit completed its first moult
in captivity, it was seen to collect nesting material. It appears the
hermit will collect almost any form of dead or dying plant life, also
hair--especially human !--cotton, wool, etc., as long as it is small
enough for the bird to carry to a chosen nest site; i.e. (i) the leaf of a
Philodendron which is growing in the communal flight, or (ii) the leaf
of a bromeliad which is growing in the birdroom.
Although the hermit searches most diligently for nesting material,

<bodyText confidence="0.997207066666667" page_id="56381632"  page_num="35" year="" vol="">
only one ritualistic action has been observed, this being when the bird
appears to collect (imaginary) cobwebs. The ritual consists of the hermit
hovering (usually in front of the wire mesh of the flight) almost station-
ary, at the same time pecking at imaginary cobwebs. When the hermit
considers it has collected enough cobwebs, the head is jerked sharply
either to the left or the right; this movement is obviously meant to
detach the cobweb from its moorings. The bird then flies directly to a
chosen nesting site and goes through the action of winding the cob-
web around the leaf. Throughout the ritual, the bird's crown feathers
are raised and those of the throat extended. It is possible the hermit
obtains some form of pleasure from this ritual, as it appears to enter a
light trance at such times.
I have not allowed the hermit to build a nest, due mainly to the fact
that it would undoubtedly become extremely aggressive towards other
members of the flight in which it is housed. As it is, the bird often
shows extreme aggression towards a female Blue-fronted Lancebill
Doryfera johannae, probably because the latter not only roosts in the
Philodendron chosen by the hermit as a possible nest site, but also
because the lancebill collects nesting material itself.
Because the hermit is not allowed to build a nest, I have only wit-
nessed what must be the commencement of nest building. This consists
of the bird clinging to a favoured leaf and winding nesting material
(either real or imaginary) around the leaf with its beak. It appears the
tongue is also used (could this be to moisten the material with
saliva?). Once the hermit considers the material is secure, it releases
the leaf and flies around it in a spiral, twining the material as it does so.
Nest defence
At times, the hermit can show extreme aggression to any humming-
bird which hovers or attempts to perch near the former's chosen nesting
site in the communal flight. The hermit will also show extreme aggres-
sion when released from the flight; at such times, however, the
aggressive display is directed toward the female D. johannae only. The
latter display consists of the hermit hovering directly in front of the
female lancebill, often moving rapidly either to the left or to the right
so as to keep in line with the latter. At such times the hermit's tail is
fanned to the utmost, the neck is arched and the beak is opened
slightly; sometimes the bird can be heard to utter a low-pitched chur-
ring note.
If the door of the communal flight is left ajar, the hermit may cease
to display, enter the flight and chase after the female lancebill, uttering
a series of loud chureks as it does so.
Egg laying
The hermit laid its first egg in captivity on the 21st April, 1974;
a second egg was laid on the 23rd. The bird laid again on the 25th
October, a matter of days after completing its third moult in cap-

tivity. On the 6th November the bird laid again, and again on the
15th November. It was January the 4th, 1975, before the bird laid
another egg; the bird laid again on the 17th and the 19th of March,
and yet again on the 28th. All the eggs have been laid from the
perch and, other than the first egg which the bird had difficulty in
passing, all have been laid without problems. In fact egg number three
(the only one which I have actually witnessed being laid) was pro-
duced without any signs of strain in a matter of seconds. Egg number
four was slightly soft-shelled; the remainder have been perfectly formed.
After egg laying, nesting activity has been fairly low for a time,
although the hermit has been seen to collect a small amount of
material at such times, probably to renovate the imaginary nest.
Song
At one time I rarely heard the hermit sing; in fact during 1972 the
song was heard only once. However, in the latter part of 1973, the
hermit became more vocal and by December of that year, could be
heard singing for approximately one hour, one morning out of four.
During 1974 (except during the moulting period), the bird became
even more vocal and was heard to sing on average three out of every
five mornings; however, the song was rarely heard after 10 a.m. Why
the bird should sing mainly during the morning, I cannot say. A
female Reddish Hermit I owned was heard to sing at all hours of the
day (Mobbs 1971).
When singing, the hermit fans the tail feathers and extends those
of the throat. The tail is wagged up and down more slowly and with
greater emphasis than normal. The bird looks about the whole time
(as if for a mate (?)); sometimes leaving the perch for a second or so
before returning and commencing to sing again. During these short
flights, the feathers of the throat are usually extended.
Call-notes
The hermit can be heard calling many times throughout the day.
These call-notes are used mostly when the bird is on the wing, or prior
to taking to the wing. As already described, certain call-notes are
used during display; there is also a weak call used only when the bird
is distressed, usually through being chased by another hummingbird.

Much has been written with regard to Phaethornis species observed
in the wild; superciliosus having such a vast range, has been studied
and written about a number of times, yet to my knowledge, no orni-
thologist has given a detailed description of the display of this species.
Nicholson (1931) wrote more on the song and call-notes than the actual
display (see later). Like most authors, Nicholson was unable to sex
superciliosus in the field and presumed that silent birds were females
and those which sang were males. However, he mentions collecting
a supposed pair, which when dissected, turned out to be both males.

Davis (1934) described what he considered to be a perched display of
a male, but I am in agreement with Snow (1973), that the actions
described are more likely to be exaggerated stretching movements
usually made by the Trochilidae prior to taking to the wing after a
rest period.
From observations made by me and other aviculturists, there is no
doubt in my mind that both male and female Phaethornis have a song.
Having already described the difference in the song of the male and
female Reddish Hermit (Mobbs 1971), I have no doubt that should
I have the opportunity to study male as well as female Long-tailed
Hermits, I would be able to differentiate between the song patterns
of the sexes. I should perhaps point out that to determine the difference,
both birds would need to be taken from the same area, as there is a
possibility that the song differs from one locality to the next. This
certainly appears to be the case where P. ruber is concerned (Snow
1973)-
The song of a supposed male P. superciliosus is described by Skutch
(1964) as "A single squeaky note, incessantly reiterated, . . . "; by
Davis (1958) as a "monotonous insect-like song 'jang, jang, jang ...'";
and by Nicholson (1931) as a "continuous flow of monosyllabic short-
clipped notes, hard and insect-like in quality 'Jang, jang, jang, jang
or sometimes double "j anger, janger, j anger". Snow (1973) does
not give the vocal renderings the distinction of song, but writes that "the
call-notes are a rapidly repeated chip, chip, chip, or chit, chit, chit,
etc.". The main part of the song of my female is an oft repeated
note which has a definite trill to it; however, the bird will also utter
a few low warbling notes from time to time.
I feel certain the song of my female Long-tailed is an advertising
one and because of this, feel that there is a possibility many of the
supposed all-male leks described in various papers, could comprise
both sexes, especially as certain authors state that it is difficult (or
impossible) to sex Phaethornis in the wild.
The only references I have been able to find regarding combined
display between male and female hummingbirds are, a brief account
by Scamell (1966) describing a small part of the display performed
by a breeding pair of Sparkling Violet-eared Colibri coruscans and
the combined "tok" display of male and female Green Hermits P. guy
(Snow 1974).
I have witnessed combined display in the Black-tailed Trainbearer
Lesbia victoriae (Mobbs 1970), and also in the Purple-throated Garib
Eulampis jugularis.
It is interesting to note that the combined display of the violet-
eared and the carib are in certain respects similar. It is also inter-
esting to note that not only are the sexes almost identical in these
species, but that the female's display is similar to that of the male;

also a female will incite a male by displaying before him. Carib fe-
males will often display, even when the male to which the display is
being directed is not in breeding condition; however, should the male
fail to respond, the female appears to quickly lose interest, even though
she may be in breeding condition herself.
The sexes in the Black-tailed Trainbearer are dissimilar and al-
though I have on numerous occasions witnessed a combined display,
it has always been the male who has been the instigator.
As the sexes in all Phaethornis species are similar and, as there is a
good possibility that all females have a song, I feel that the displays
described in this paper are those which would usually be performed
by a female in breeding condition.
Display (a) is very much like the "tok" display performed by both
sexes of the Green Hermit, as described by Snow ( l.c .). If all the
Phaethornis perform a combined display, then this would account
for the displays described in this paper. As I have mentioned in earlier
articles (Mobbs 1973 &amp; 1974), it is possible that certain displays begin
as aggression turning to mating display only when a willing partner
is found. Although in the past I have associated such behaviour with
male hummingbirds only, I see no reason why it should not appertain
to females also.
Displays (a, b, c, d &amp; f) could be acts of aggression, but would
I feel most certainly turn to mating display if a willing partner were
found. Display (e) is surely a form of soliciting.
Although much has been written on Phaethornis species, there is still
much to be learnt especially with regard to song and display. What
an opportunity this would be for some enterprising zoo or bird garden
who could give over a small area in which a group of hermits could
be kept. Such a group would need to be of the same species, taken
from the same area and if possible be in a ratio of one male to every
two females.
I would dearly like to carry out such an experiment myself, but
living as I do in a first floor flat, space is very limited. Also it would
be impossible for a private aviculturist such as I to obtain more than
one or two of a species at the same time and if anything is to be
learned, all the birds would need to be released into the prepared area
simultaneously.

between the sexes. Delacour (1951) notes : "The male can only be
recognised from the female by the presence of a short spur on the
tarsus, slightly larger size, stronger legs and the rounder, more exten-
sive, red wattles on the sides of the face. When the spurs are missing,
as happens sometimes in captive specimens ... or are present in the
female, the last three characteristics are the only and not too obvious
distinctions between them."
These "not too obvious distinctions" may even be nullified in the
case of young birds that must be sexed before sale as well as in border-
line adult individuals--the "maley" females and the "femaley" males--
to whom these criteria do not apply. I do not mention Crossoptilon
crossoptilon because I have not yet had an opportunity to study this
species, but the borderline individuals in my collection of Crossoptilon
auritum and C. mantchuricum represented a substantial minority,
enough to be of concern in avicultural management. There were
literally several cases where I could only helplessly wait to see whether
the unsexed bird would lay an egg : had I had a non-laying hen, even
that would have been futile.
The first step in identifying the sex of an eared pheasant was to
collect data on the distinctions noted by Delacour. With the exception
of spurs, all involved size (larger size, stronger legs, more extensive face
wattles) and this called for tarsal and face wattle measurements. When
these measurements revealed overlapping of male-female size charac-
teristics it became necessary to try other methods of distinguishing
between the sexes. The most reliable method turned out to be the vent-
sexing of chicks. Chromosome analysis of blood samples was not
considered because of the prohibitive cost.

The behaviour of adult birds was analysed to see which elements
would give clues to the sex of the individual. The role of sex dominance
and the significance of breeding season postures and displays were
examined.
The study of morphological and behavioural characteristics of 25
adult birds over six years revealed that there was no single visible and
conclusive index. A borderline individual acquired as an adult had to
be assessed in terms of a combination of factors, physical and
behavioural, for successful identification of sex.

The data collected on 15 Brown and Blue Eared showed that neither
tarsal length nor tarsal diameter is a totally reliable criterion. The
tarsal length of three Brown Eared males was 6 to 7.5 mm. longer
than those of three Brown Eared hens; the tarsal length of four Blue
Eared males was o to 7 mm. longer than those of five Blue Eared hens.
The tarsal diameter of three brown and blue males was .5 to 4 mm.
larger than that of eight brown and blue hens; two brown males had
the same tarsal diameter as the thickest legged blue hen (12.5 mm.)
and one blue male had a tarsal diameter .5 mm. less than the diameter
of the thickest-legged blue hen.
In this sampling, the face wattles of males were consistently larger
vertically and horizontally than those of the females, but the differ-
ences can be relatively small and hard to distinguish with the eye,
particularly outside of the breeding season. Vertical measurements of
the face wattles at their widest point showed a difference between the
species with the blue males showing more extensive face wattles than
the browns : a difference ranging from 4 to 13 mm. The brown males
showed a vertical measurement 4 to 11 mm. larger than the hens, and
the blue males 6.5 to 15 mm. larger than the females.
Horizontal measurements of the face wattles showed the brown
males 2 to 13 mm. longer than the brown hens, and the blue males
3 to 10.5 mm. longer than the blue hens.
In correlating data for individuals, the female with the longest
tarsus (Annie) also had the thickest tarsus. However, her face wattle
was female-like. The female with the most male-like face wattle
(Fannie, Annie's sibling) had an average female tarsal length and dia-
meter coupled with fully developed spurs. The males with tarsal
diameter similar to those of the females (James and Billy) had male-
like tarsal length and large face wattles. Thus characteristics of the
opposite sex in one area do not necessarily correspond with those in
another area.
Of the 15 birds measured, two blue hens were siblings, one blue hen
was the daughter of an unrelated pair and one brown hen was the
daughter of an unrelated pair. In this limited sampling, related birds

did not show notable similarities.
Weights were taken on the charted birds on an ounce scale too
unreliable to warrant giving the data. However, the average male
weighed approximately a half pound more than the average female.
The difference would only be significant if all birds weighed were in
the same optimum condition, e.g. a male in poor condition might well
be the same weight as a hen in good condition. Weights reported on
the blue in the wild (Ekvall 1938) show cocks and hens alike weighed
an average of six to eight pounds.
Attempts to sex three-month birds by measurement were unsuccess-
ful. Measurements of tarsi and face wattles showed no pattern
susceptible to analysis. The first problem was that of differences in
rate of growth; the second that face wattles of young males do not
show full development until they are in their first breeding season.
With blue males this is usually when they are a year old, while brown
males attain their full size, spur formation and breeding ability only
in their second year.
(2) Vent-sexing of chicks
The most effective method of sexing chicks is by cloacal examination.
The rudimentary organ or male process in the male pheasant at hatch-
ing is visible as paired thickenings with erectile tissue on the ventral
wall quite close to the cloacal opening (Pettingill 1970); the female
shows no such thickenings. They are visible to the naked eye but are
difficult to spot without considerable practice and good light, preferably
daylight. I have not been able to take precise measurements but the
papillae seem to measure roughly a millimetre. An application of
lidocctine ointment relaxes the sphincter muscle and makes it easier to
evert the cloaca. Speed and gentleness are essential to prevent a nervous
chick from going into shock.
The method of cloacal identification has, of course, been used by
poultry hatcheries for many years to sex newly hatched chicks. It is
often referred to as the "Japanese" method because it is so frequently
used by chick sexers of Japanese origin (Card &amp; Nesheim 1972).
There is another method occasionally used by poultry hatcheries
which is worth mentioning although it is not practicable for the avi-
culturist. It involves the use of an instrument--a light with a probe
attached--which makes it possible to see the testes of the male chicks
through the intestinal wall. Its drawbacks, however, are considerable.
The cost of the instrument is high (approx. $450); it takes considerable
skill to use and used without the requisite skill can damage the delicate
internal tissues of the chick. Since the testes appear only as a shadow
it is probably no more accurate than cloacal examination.
Behavioural differences

more complex than morphological parameters, but some of the more

obvious elements are relatively easy to observe. Changes in sex domin-
ance, keeper-oriented aggression and courtship behaviour can be most
useful in conjunction with morphological factors to distinguish sex.
Unfortunately, these appear only during the breeding season.
Observations on sex dominance
Outside the breeding season, sex dominance is not a reliable index.
Individual differences are so marked that it is impossible to generalise.
Beebe (1918-1922), renowned for his description of pheasants in the
wild, has a brief note on the behaviour of eared pheasants in captivity :
"The sociality and gregariousness of eared pheasants is more pro-
nounced than that in any other species of this family. There is a
complete lack of masculine pugnaciousness, chief cause of flock and
family dissension among gallinaceous birds. When several birds are
kept in captivity in a runway they are almost always close together.
No one bird, male or female, seems to take the lead but there is seldom
more than a moment when a trio or quartet of birds are more than a
few feet apart."
My own observations differ somewhat from Beebe's although I have
seen the peaceable world he describes, particularly among young birds
before their first breeding season. In general my experience has been
with adult birds penned in pairs. Since eared pheasants are basically
monogamous, this arrangement strengthens the pair bond and holds
less potential for conflict than there may be with birds kept in trios,
or indeed in larger groups. I know of only one breeder who attempted
flock breeding of eared pheasants and he was forced to give it up
because of fighting among the hens.
Either male or female dominance may be seen outside the breeding
season or as Beebe remarks, neither of the sexes may take precedence,
and it may be more accurate to discuss this factor as rank in the
social hierarchy. The most obvious indication of rank in compatible
birds where there is no aggression is seen in the inter-individual
reactions to the presentation of food treats : the ranking bird stands
close to the food as he eats; the lower-ranking bird stands to the rear
or to one side, stretches out his neck and grabs what he can. He
quickly steps back if the ranking bird makes an aggressive head move-
ment toward him. In some cases the lower-ranking bird is fearful of
approaching at all, and rushes over only after the first bird has finished
and wanders off. Although in the majority of cases the ranking indi-
vidual is male, I had two females who considerably outranked the
males. When treats were presented, the males were immediately chased
away and were not permitted into the vicinity until the food had been
consumed. After a short period the males did not even attempt to
come forward for the treats. In both cases a change of pen and
lengthy separation from the male did not change the rank order. It
was only with the approach of the breeding season that there was a

complete turnaround, and the female rank bowed to male sex domin-
ance. Schjelderup Ebbe (1924) generalised that in all animals female
dominance has a detrimental effect on procreation. In the case of one
of the two pairs described, no fertile eggs were produced and there
may indeed have been no copulation. The other hen laid few eggs and
less than half of these were fertile. Noble (1939) points out that the
dominance drive in all vertebrates is continuous whereas the sex
drive with its hormonal basis is cyclic. Thus in the birds mentioned,
the hormone-induced aggressiveness of the males during the breeding
season outweighed the dominance drive of the hens.
Male birds in general seem to go into season before the females who
are less advanced physiologically in their sexual development and who
need to receive psychological stimulation from the male to produce a
normal sequence of reproductive behaviour (Bremond 1963). All
seasonal references are based on the climate in my area of southern
New York State and here early March with its lengthening daylight
produces personality changes in the males as well as an easily observed
morphological change--the face wattles appear enlarged and a brighter
scarlet in colouring. Sometimes these changes may be noticeable on a
warm bright day as early as January. A marked increase in calling,
in restless movement and in aggressiveness towards the keeper are all
very obvious at this time of year.
Vocalisation
A comparison of male and female calls is a reliable method of
sexing eared pheasants and is worth noting here, although it may not
be properly within the scope of this article since it requires equipment
not available to most aviculturists. Galls recorded on magnetic tape
and analysed from sonagrams show the female call has a frequency
some 0.5 kiloherz higher than that of the male. (Thompson, work on
vocalisation of Crossoptilon in progress.) This small but consistent
difference is not obvious to the human ear.
A very obvious phenomenon, however, is the pronounced increase
in calling which occurs among the male birds at the onset of the breed-
ing season. This increase was measured by monthly one-hour tape
recordings made at one hour after sunrise.
In January calling was heard for 11.5 seconds, in February for 5
seconds, in March it rose dramatically to 79.5 seconds and in April to
83.5 seconds (this timetable dovetails with testosterone development in
the males induced by lengthening daylight; taping dates : 6th January,
9 hrs. 27 min. daylight; 19th February, 10 hrs. 51 min.; 10th March,
11 hrs. 40 min.; 21st April, 13 hrs. 29 min.). By May, calling was
reduced to nine seconds; in June and July there was no calling at ail,
but in August calling rose to 73 seconds with both males and females
involved.
The pattern is revelatory when seen within the context of the annual

<bodyText confidence="0.997351355555556" page_id="56381643"  page_num="44" year="" vol="">
cycle of vocalisation. During the year both males and females call.
Galling bouts may be initiated by either male or female and the call
of a single bird triggers calling from the others that may last up to a
minute or more. The winter, with short days and bad weather, is a
relatively quiet time and the increase in calling which takes place in
March is almost entirely restricted to the males. The hens appear in a
relaxed state and show no change from their normal winter behaviour.
The exception may be a hen penned alone or occasionally the ranking
bird among two or more females penned together. She is likely to
initiate or join in the male calling bouts.
This social phenomenon of the male calling bout would seem at this
period to fulfil a sexual stimulatory function, a mutual building up of
sexual tensions in the males which will lead at a slightly later stage to
more specific courtship displays. In the wild this period would be
analogous to the time before the winter flock breaks up into individual
pairs. Beebe reports that eared pheasants ramble in flocks of 10 to 30
birds during the winter; in spring they separate into pairs, those which
seem to be old mated pairs going off quietly, hinting there is tacit
acceptance of the old tie even during winter flocking.
The increase in the volume of calling in March and April and the
subsequent drop off in May indicates that frequent calling is associated
with the early part of the breeding season when the males begin to go
into breeding condition and when, in April, they court the hens with
tidbitting and display. When the breeding pairs are established and
copulation and egg-laying are in full swing, calling falls off dramatic-
ally and does not increase again until August. The breeding-laying
cycle in our area starts late April to early May and lasts to mid or late
June.
Aggressive behaviour
A typical index of male behaviour which develops or is heightened
in the pre-breeding season is aggressiveness toward the keeper expressed
in posture and sometimes attack. Since most eared pheasant chicks
are hand-raised in small groups, and the species is very sociable and
gregarious with humans as well as conspecifics, the chicks become
extremely tame. The tamer the male the more fearless and aggressive
he becomes at this time of year : this may involve some degree of mal-
printing or it may be a territorial defence reaction to confinement in a
relatively small area, or both.
The posture shown to the keeper by an aggressive male has elements
of the courtship display that will later be directed toward the female.
In aggressive display, the contour feathers are raised so that male
looks much enlarged, the wing facing the keeper is slightly drooped
with occasionally a slight spreading of the last two or three primaries.
The opposite wing is slightly raised so that it is visible above the back
which is tipped toward the keeper and this adds to the appearance of

greater size. The rump contour feathers are so exaggeratedly raised as
to give the appearance of a hump. The face wattles are bright scarlet
and much enlarged. The whole appearance presents a beautiful
example of what Heinroth (1930) called "Imponierungsgehaben", a
posture designed to impress the courted female and to threaten a
competing male. As the bird moves around or toward the keeper he
utters a repetitive conversation sound which is louder, more insistent
and produced at a quicker tempo than when he is in a non-aggressive
mood. Both the appearance and the vocalisation seem threatening and
the bird seems to be exhibiting agonistic behaviour; he is torn between
the incompatible desire to attack and the desire to flee (Morris 1970),
he is balanced between aggression and fear. The balance can tip in
either direction--if chased by the keeper he may flee or he may
respond by direct attack. Or he may without provocation from the
keeper move from aggressive display posture to attack. In either case
the contour feathers settle down as he runs at the keeper, attacking
shoe, leg, or a momentarily lowered head. The eared pheasant does
not usually fly up to attack as a Silver Pheasant does. He will occasion-
ally attack from a roost if the keeper approaches but the attack will
still be on a horizontal level. The agonistic posture described above is
quite different from the posture exhibited by eared pheasants fighting
with conspecifics in which the feathers are sleeked down and a pro-
tagonist makes himself tall by stretching his neck to the utmost and
then fights by beak-jabbing at the head of the opponent.
To complicate sex roles and distinctions further, it must be noted
that the aggressive display posture described, i.e. raised contour
feathers, slightly drooped wing, is not necessarily exclusive to males. I
had two yearling hens penned together. The ranking hen took a female
sex role toward me, that is she crouched for her keeper, and imme-
diately thereafter proceeded to display toward a male visible in an
adjoining pen. These ambivalent sexual demonstrations coupled with
her large size and considerable spur development made me unable to
sex her definitively until she started laying.
Lorenz (1935) in discussing species of birds, reports that "an isolated
female deprived of male company always inclines toward exhibition of
male demonstrative behaviour ... a female can only respond in a
feminine way when she is presented with a socially dominant con-
specific". Thus my pheasant hen treated her keeper as a socially
dominant conspecific and treated her pen mate and the male in the
adjoining pen as though they were female and she was male. This hen
furthermore was one of the exceptions mentioned above in a dis-
cussion of vocalisation, taking full part in the March calling bouts of
the males.
In captivity the eared pheasant male may also be dangerously
aggressive toward the hen. This type of behaviour seems to be most

common in the early part of the breeding season when the males have
come into breeding condition and the hens are not yet receptive to
mating. The lateral display presented by eared and most other phea-
sants is analysed by Schenkel (1958) as demonstrating aggressive-sexual
tendencies sublimated by intimacy and sociability into non-aggressive
sexual tendencies. However, he notes that the tenuous nature of the
artificially induced intimacy of caged birds can lead to such aberra-
tions as the killing of the female by the male.
Courtship and reproductive behaviour
In this section the chronology of male and female behaviour is out-
lined : (1) male tidbitting, (q) male display to attract and impress the
female and to stimulate her desire for mating, (3) female crouching
and head-weaving, indicating her readiness to mate, (4) mounting and
copulation. The full description, involving a summation of the inter-
actions of a breeding pair, which may take place over a period of
weeks, follows.
The earliest ritualised courtship behaviour to be observed in the
males is "tidbitting", a term used to describe courtship feeding, i.e.
the presentation of food by the male to the female during the breed-
ing season. Stokes and Williams (1971) in their article on galiiform
courtship feeding analyse several types and place Crossoptilon in the
category of "freezing over the food". "The male approaches the food
and dabbles a few times in cursory fashion, the beak held close to the
ground. As he does so he begins to call. When the hen comes to within
a metre of him he 'freezes' over the food, body taut and the beak held
within a few centimetres of the ground. The cock continues to call
until the hen has taken the food from the ground in front of him."
Another category described is "dabbling and head movements". "The
cock dabbles with the food, picking it up and dropping it numerous
times. When the hen does not respond immediately, he exaggerates the
head movements." From observations of my birds I believe that eared
pheasants may be an intermediate type showing elements of both,
depending on the intensity of the stimulus.
My birds are accustomed to daily greens, different varieties of fruit,
peanuts, raisins, and occasional mealworms, and usually male and
female come running as the keeper enters the pen. During most of the
year both birds gobble up the treats as fast as they can, uttering a food
vocalisation which alerts the remainder of the flock to the news that
treats have been presented.
Mealworms, of which the birds never seem to tire, present the
strongest stimulus for tidbitting. Starting in March, sometimes earlier,
tidbitting behaviour is seen in adult males. When mealworms are pre-
sented, the male, head held close to the ground, dabbles with the
mealworm, picking it up and dropping it numerous times and giving
his food vocalisation. During this performance his face wattles are

much enlarged. Only after the female has eaten a good number of
mealworms (anywhere between six and 12) does he start eating as well.
One year no mealworms were fed during the winter. The first time
they were presented in April three adult males "froze" as described by
Stokes and Williams. One of the three "froze" only until the hen had
consumed five or six mealworms, then he started dabbling, and finally
he ate. The following day none of the males froze--all dabbled. (Three
yearling males neither froze nor dabbled--they just gobbled right
along with the hens.) It would seem that under the most powerful
stimulus---mealworms to which the birds are not accustomed--freezing
over the food takes place, but that in the case of a lesser stimulus, i.e.
mealworms as a more habitual treat, the dabbling response is invoked.
Tidbitting is associated exclusively with courtship behaviour. Once
a pair is well into the breeding season it is no longer seen. On the other
hand, when I experimented with injecting testosterone into a brown
male who stopped mating with his hen early in the season, he restarted
the courtship-breeding cycle with aggressive postures toward me, tid-
bitting with his hen, display and attempted mounting. Unfortunately,
by that time the hen had stopped laying.
Observation of tidbitting is a reliable index of sex distinction. I have
never seen a female tidbit, and although it is not inconceivable, it
would be most unusual.
When the male goes into full breeding condition, in April, he
presents his courtship display to the hen and attempts to mount her.
Most males prefer privacy for courtship and I have observed only one
full-fledged display. James, an adult blue male, had spent the winter
months in a pen adjoining that of Mary, a two-year-old hen who had
never been mated. In early April the gate between the pens was
opened. Mary entered James's pen and started foraging. James moved
in front of her and immediately presented a lateral display. His face
wattles were enlarged and glowing scarlet. The primary feathers on the
side facing the hen were drooped with the tenth primary touching the
ground. The upper tail-coverts and the contour feathers over the rump
were stiff and erect; the tail feathers were fanned out. The body and
the tail were tipped toward the hen. The primaries and secondaries on
the far side of the hen were spread but the wing was not drooped. The
head was curved with the beak pulled in toward the chest but was
angled away from the hen although the curve of the head made it
possible for the eye of the male to be constantly on the hen while
showing his vivid face wattle to the best advantage. As Mary moved
about James pursued her at a measured pace, constantly attempting
to get in front of her to present his display. Early on during the display
James tried to leap on the hen but she ducked away and he again
started displaying. Occasionally he stopped to beak-wipe or to bang
his beak against the feeder. He ignored the peanuts that were strewn

about and did not give Mary a chance to stop and pick at them, for
she kept moving away as he approached. The display was unceasing
for 30 minutes, then it became less marked, and after 50 minutes it
ceased entirely. James foraged for about five minutes, and then started
displaying again. At no time did the hen indicate mating readiness.
This display was accompanied by only minimal vocalisation and no
calling.
Breeding males show much less reluctance to copulate in front of
the keeper than they do to display. The copulations observed have
involved long-mated pairs and occurred either after a brief chase of
the hen by the male, or after an invitation extended to the male by
the female in a crouching posture. The hen crouches on her tarsi,
raises her wingbows slightly, drops her tail and starts a pronounced
head movement, weaving the head back and forth in an arc-like
rhythmic movement, beak tucked in toward the chest, until she is
mounted. Possibly since Crossoptilon lacks sexual dimorphism this is a
signal that aids in sex recognition, or perhaps it is a now-ritualised way
of drawing attention to her sexual invitation and distinguishing it from
the ordinary postures of resting or dust-bathing. Schleidt (1967) notes
that among gallinaceous birds the squatting of the hen and the nape-
grabbing of the male as he mounts is a method of orientation--if the
heads of the two birds are properly aligned the bodies will line up
accordingly and successful copulation can take place.
A crouching head-weaving female almost invariably causes a male
in breeding condition to mount. He grabs the nape of the hen in his
beak and treads her with wings slightly drooped and tail feathers fanned
out. The hen's tail moves to the side to facilitate cloacal contact. After
copulation both birds ruffle their feathers and shake themselves
vigorously.

Breeding results at Cleres in 1975 were among the poorest in many
years. This unfortunate record was certainly due to highly erratic
weather conditions in Northern France. After a wet, frostless winter,
the spring was unusually cold, and there was a sharp frost the last
night but one in May. Birds became upset by such freak weather and
the consequences were unfertile eggs, or even no laying at all. Such
was the case of normally reliable breeders such as certain waterfowl,
particularly Red-breasted Geese or Demoiselle Cranes, which simply
did not nest. This happened all over France.
Two pairs of Emus produced 24 young, but all the Rheas' eggs
proved to be clear. This has become frequent all over Europe in the
last few years, the reason for which remains mysterious. Inbreeding
may be the answer.
We lost a male cassowary in a rather strange way. He became very
ill in June with terrific internal haemorrhage. Dr. Ciarpaglini doctored
him and he seemed to be cured; but he started bleeding again in July
and died promptly, having lost all the blood. Autopsy revealed a
puncture of the intestine due to a bamboo splinter the bird had
swallowed.
Cranes did badly; we had only one clutch from the Crowned
Cranes and two from the pair of Sarus, but no egg hatched, being
clear or addled. Only one Black-necked Swan was reared out of three
hatched and we had several infertile clutches, a rare occurrence.
Various young geese were reared without difficulty, but few of each
species.
Seven Cuban Whistling Ducks, however, produced 29 young, the
largest brood from a trio, and we had a dozen Comb Ducks from a
group of one drake and six ducks; it is important, with that species,
to associate many females with each male. Among the ducks reared,
all of fairly common species, I shall mention seven Greater Brazilian
Teal.

Pheasants were also only moderately successful; we had a young
pair of Bare-faced Curassows.
A number of pigeons and doves nested. Pairs of Common and
Victoria Crowned Pigeons had three weeks old squabs in the nest,
but they died without apparent reason, no doubt of some disease.
Some Ashy and Tambourine Doves were reared.
Small birds were also rather unsuccessful. Broods of Black-faced
Scarlet Tanagers, Spreos and Parrotbills did not survive. Two pairs
of Orange-headed Thrushes produced 15 young, but only two were
saved. They were heavily parasitised by some kind of roundworm,
which, in other birds, are fairly easily controlled by vermifuges; but
thrushes do vomit the medicine and therefore cannot be cured.
We hand-reared three Kookaburras, but our old breeding pair,
which has so far produced 17 young at Cleres, behaved in the most un-
predictable way. The first clutch of two eggs, in May, was easily
hatched in an incubator and raised as usual; a second clutch produced
another one. Then, a few days later, we found that the hen had been
attacked and slightly damaged by the male. She was removed and
she promptly recovered, but the male attacked her as soon as we
put them together. We removed him, hoping that such a change
would alter his attitude. He, however, attacked her again after he was
returned to the aviary two weeks later. Finally, the two birds have
been living since in two adjacent outdoor cages, and it is hoped that
peace between them will be restored during the winter. It is, however,
puzzling behaviour, after four years of perfect pairing. A three years
old pair has not yet bred, although frequently visiting the nesting
boxes and hammering on the walls during the spring and summer.

ADDITIONAL NOTES ON DISPLAYS OF QUEEN CAROLA'S
BIRD OF PARADISE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.972498666666667" page_id="56381651"  page_num="52" year="" vol="">
By C. B. Frith (Phuket Island, Thailand) and D. Coles
(Prospect, South Australia)
As a result of a previous publication (Frith 1968) and some corres-
pondence a meeting occurred between the present authors. David
Coles was for some time a bird keeper at Chester Zoo, where observa-
tions were made for the above mentioned publication. Whilst there he
made notes on the behaviour of the pair of Queen Carola's Birds of
Paradise Parotia carolae observed by Frith in 1967. Due to the fre-
quency of observations made by Coles he was able to obtain an
impression of more typical behaviour of this pair. As the previous data
were recently published in this magazine, including several descriptive
drawings, reference is given to it rather than repeating display descrip-
tions here. The following notes were made by Coles during the summer
of 1968. All reference to previous publication refers to Frith (1968)
unless otherwise stated.
No additional pre-high intensity displays were observed. Those
already described were witnessed often and showed little or no varia-
tion. A significant and considerably different pattern of behaviour was
noted regularly, however, during the high intensity displays. This
dhplav was seen four times by Frith, being executed each time on a
perch and it was then considered possible that this may be the case
in the wild. Observations by Coles, however, do not agree with this,
for out of approximately thirty-six high intensity displays seen by him,
only one was performed on a perch, the rest being performed on the
ground. The area of ground used for these displays was kept clean and
bare by the male. The bird postured itself in exactly the same way as
previously described but hopped continuously during the display and
in addition moved the head conspicuously from side to side.
A noteworthy sequence of behaviour recorded by Coles is an aspect
of which Frith made brief mention as it was observed only once. Frith
saw the female " fly down beside the male, hang upside down, look at
him and flutter to the ground " just after the male had displayed. This
peculiar female behaviour was witnessed by Coles very often, not only
after the male had displayed but also during male displays. During the
male's performance the female would " somersault backward from the
top branch above the display area to another below, missing a central
perch on the way down ". Occasionally she would flutter completely
to the ground and watch the male displaying there. Although this was
seen often by Coles he did not note the female hang down prior to
falling, the bird simply falling backward and somersaulting. This
peculiar action by the female is unlike anything previously recorded
for birds of paradise and may be the aberrant behaviour of a captive

G. B. FRITH &amp; D. COLES -QUEEN CAROLA&apos;s BIRD OF PARADISE 53
bird. This point, however, requires the observation of wild birds for
confirmation.
From the above it would seem safe to assume that Queen Garola's
Bird of Paradise does display on the ground in the wild and that this
may be the more normal situation, particularly in view of evidence
presented by Gilliard (1955, 1969). Captive Parotia wahnesi display
on the ground and on perches (Crandall 1940). Wild and captive male
P. sefilata are recorded displaying on the ground by Bergman (1957)
and ground displaying by captive male P. lawesi is described by
Crandall (1931). It is also noteworthy that with the recent discovery
of the bower system of P. wahnesi (Schodde &amp; Mason 1974) all species
of Parotia are now known to clear and maintain remarkably clean
display areas on the forest floor. These facts also support the prob-
ability of P. carolae being mostly a ground displaying bird, whilst some
display almost certainly regularly occurs on well used perches above
the cleared area. For example the " sideways facing " display pre-
viously described would appear to be exclusively a perch display.
Another important point confirmed by the additional observations
of Coles is that during high intensity display P. carolae does move the
head from side to side as is described for P. wahnesi (Crandall 1940),
P. sefilata (Bergman 1957) and P. lawesi (Crandall 1931). This head
movement has been noted to cause the ' flag wires ' to " bob "
(Bergman 1957, Crandall 1931) or "rotate" (Crandall 1940). Notes
on Parotia lawesi in the wild (Southern Highlands, Papua New Guinea)
with a photograph of the display area appeared in the Magazine
(Smyth 1970), but there were no details of the actual display.

Many of the aviaries have had changes in plants, decor and occu-
pants. We are continuing to set up breeding groups and to find
mates for our single birds--unfortunately this task was made more
necessary by an outbreak of botulism in the Bird House during
December 1974 when thirty-seven birds were lost (vet. reg. (1975) 97 :
204-205). Some of the birds for whom we have found mates include
Laminated Hill Toucan, Crested Cariama, Spectacled Owl and Nduk
Eagle Owl.
Species new to the Collection, or not seen here for many years,
include Crimson Seedcracker Pyrenestes sanguineus and Yellow-ridged
Toucan Ramphastos culminatus. A pair of Brown Eared Pheasants
was a very welcome gift.
Hatchings of perhaps the most interest are---in 1974, a Blue-backed
Manakin, Oystercatcher, Knysna Turacos and the Imperial Pheasant.
In 1975, a Laughing Kingfisher (first since 1969), two Sarus Cranes,
Scarlet x Purple-capped Lory, Grey-headed Gull, Sacred Ibis, Jer-
don's Imperial Pigeon, Oystercatcher, Abyssinian Spotted Eagle Owl
and four Snowy Owls.
We were particularly pleased to receive from Perth Zoo, Australia,
in the summer of 1974, a welcome gift of Splendid Fairy Wrens,
Crested Terns, Banded Rails, Banded Plovers, Stone Curlew and
Yellow-winged Honeyeaters.
Autumn 1974 saw the demolition of the popular Waders' Aviary
as the site is being developed to house carnivores, but fortunately a
new aviary will take its place. Some of the occupants of the old
aviary were re-housed in the Eastern Aviary and the others in the
Southern Aviary : both these aviaries have been landscaped with some
replanting. The Southern Aviary now contains an interesting collection
of sea birds, perhaps the most notable being a colony of Gentoo and
Rockhopper Penguins.
The Bird House was repainted during 1975 and new indoor aviaries
have been completed, Splendid Fairy Wrens, Laminated Hill Toucans
and Red-headed Barbets occupying some of them.
The most notable breeding success is that of the Jackson's Horn-
bills, the parents having reared four young in two years, in three
separate broods. A captive-bred pair of Black and White Casqued
Hornbills were received in exchange at the beginning of the year.
Great favourites and delightfully tame are 'Pansy' and 'Gillespie' a
Wreathed and a Southern Pied Hornbill, hand-reared in Thailand
and presented to the Zoo. More recent arrivals include three very
young Tarictic Hornbills Penelopides panini from the Philippine
Islands. A sad loss in March was the death of a Rose-crested Cockatoo,

Creation of the St. Louis Zoological Park was initially activated by
the 1904 World's Fair. This event, which commemorated the Louisiana
Purchase, took place in the city's Forest Park and for the occasion the
Smithsonian Institution financed the construction of what is still one
of the world's largest flight cages. Following the fair, the exhibit, which
measures 69.5 metres long, 25.6 m. wide and 15.2 m. high, stimulated
public interest enough to establish what is now one of the most popu-
lar and famous zoological parks in America. Besides an outstanding
assortment of mammals and reptiles, the zoo traditionally has exhibited
a bird collection that has made significant contributions to avicultural
and ornithological knowledge.
For the past two years, the bird collection with its exhibits and sup-
port facilities have undergone numerous alterations and improvements.
The Bird House exhibits, for example, were repainted and decorated
with various zoogeographic and ecological themes in mind. The depart-
ment's incubation, breeding and rearing facilities all received attention,
with emphasis placed on the construction of waterfowl, game-bird and
crane breeding areas. Two hospital-holding rooms were painted, air-
conditioned, and new cages for sick and injured specimens were in-
stalled. The Stupp Memorial Pheasantry, constructed in 1954, was
renovated.
Diets utilised within the department were evaluated and readjusted
in order to fulfil the nutritional requirements of each specimen. One
of the most important tasks undertaken involved reviewing the size
and composition of the bird collection itself. Considerations were
given to the availability of exhibit space, propagation potentials, scienti-
fic and educational value, staffing and other managerial factors. As a
result, several avian species were either eliminated or procured in an
effort to comply with these guidelines.
Since the previously mentioned projects, as well as others, required
the full participation of bird department personnel, an active propa-
gation programme received low priority. Yet, in spite of this, there
were some interesting results. A total of 57 Emus and 27 Greater Rheas
were reared during this period. Several species of waterfowl and game-

birds were hatched and reared, including Nene and Lesser White-
fronted Geese, Germain's Peacock Pheasants, Satyr Tragopans, Crested
Wood Partridges and Vieillot's Crested Fireback Pheasants, to name a
few. Probably the most notable successes occurred with cranes. In
1974 two Eastern Crowned Cranes and two Stanley Cranes were
hatched and reared. In 1975 two Indian Sams, two Stanley and five
Eastern Crowned Cranes were hatched and reared, all from artificially
incubated eggs. A Demoiselle Crane was hatched by its parents, but they
failed to rear it. Various smaller species such as the Red and White
Crake, Spur-winged Plover, Red-rumped Parrot, Orange-fronted
Conure, Diamond Dove and the Saffron Finch also produced progeny.
Certainly the most significant event was the hatching and rearing of a
Mottled Owl Ciccaba virgata which is believed to be an avicultural
"first" and which forms the subject of a paper in preparation.
With the majority of rehabilitation projects now completed, our
attention can be focussed on an accelerated breeding programme.
Nesting facilities have been constructed and implemented where pos-
sible, and a continuous search is being made to pair up unmated speci-
mens.

Mr. Cliff Wright sends a report of the nesting and hand-rearing of
the Moluccan Cockatoo C. moluccensis, also known as the Rose-
crested or Salmon-crested Cockatoo. In 1972 he obtained a female to
make up a pair, her sex being distinguished by the iris colour
---brown in the female and black in the male. In March 1974 one
egg was laid but this became buried in the mixture of sawdust and
peat moss that had been put into the wooden barrel nest; two more
eggs were laid in August, but failed to hatch. They had been incu-
bated, apparently by both the pair for 36 days, the male sitting by
day and the female by night. In June 1975 two more eggs were laid
and after 38-39 days young were heard. The chicks were covered
with yellow down and the beaks were light in colour.
The diet provided included peanuts, raisins, apple, spray millet,
Budgerigar seed mixture, sunflower, paddy rice, bread, cheese, Farex
mixed with Ostermilk, honey and water, maggots and chickweed,
both these latter foods being eaten in large quantities, dandelion
leaves being also eaten, but no fruit was taken after the hatching
until late August when some pear was eaten. Meat was offered, but
was not eaten. On September 6th one chick died (at 43 days of age)
and on the nth when it appeared that the parents were no longer
feeding the survivor, it was taken and hand-reared on Heinz strained
baby food, given hot by means of a syringe and by November the
chick was being weaned on to seed. It flew for the first time at 104
days of age.

The 1975 International Symposium on Zoo Design and Construction
held at Paignton was such a success that it is proposed to hold another
this year, from May 1 ith until May 13th, also, of course, at Paignton.
As before, the symposium will include aviary design and accommoda-

Ornithology at the New York Zoological Society's park writes to
say that in addition to the Green Wood Hoopoes, breeding successes
in The World of Birds include Tawny Frogmouths (three breeding
pairs), Sun Bitterns (two breeding pairs, themselves hatched there),
Double-toothed Barbets and a White-breasted Touraco Corythaixoides

The American Federation of Aviculturists' journal watghbird con-
tains an account by John Tobin and Richard S. Rundel of the first
captive breeding of the Plate-billed Mountain Toucan or Laminated
Hill Toucan Andigena laminirostris. The birds had been in the Los
Angeles Zoo collection since 1967 and had been kept with other
species of mountain toucan and some small parrots, all agreeing well
together until nesting boxes were put into the aviary, when the toucans
became rather aggressive, particularly towards the parrots and they
were then separated into pairs, each pair with its own aviary. The
first egg was laid in July 1974, the nest being in a hollowed palm
tree some two feet in diameter and about eight feet tall. The first
egg and the second disappeared, but in September 1974 one egg
hatched after 16 days incubation, but the chick died after 21 days.
Two eggs laid in December hatched early in January and the chicks
were fed by the parents on "pinkies" (baby mice?) and pieces of
fruit, cut up mice being added later. Throughout the incubation and
rearing periods the adults enlarged and deepened the nesting cavity
to about six feet deep. The first chick left the nest at seven weeks
of age and the second two days later. Both were independent at 10
weeks.

Among the 1974 records of rare breeding birds in the United
Kingdom, published in British birds are two of Golden Oriole,
three of Fieldfare, 19 probable breedings of Redwing, five of Cetti's
Warbler, one of Savi's Warbler and about 560 pairs of Dartford
Warbler probably bred in southern England, compared with n after
the severe winter of 1962-63; also 7-11 of Snow Bunting in Scotland.
A Red-tailed Wheatear Oenanthe xanthoprymna on the Isle of May,
Fifeshire, on August 31st would be, if accepted, the first record of
this species for the British Isles.

There may be some confusion over what constitutes a generation in
the breeding of birds. The young of a pair breeding in each of three
years would be their "children" whereas the third generation would
be the "great grand-children" of that original pair.

PINE CROSSBILLS : A Scottish contribution. By Desmond Nether-
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998439129032258" page_id="56381658"  page_num="59" year="" vol="">
sole-Thompson. Berkhamsted. T. &amp; A. D. Poyser. (1975). pp.
256. One col. pi.; 24 photos, drawings, 5 appendices, 12 tables,
bibliogr. #5.00.
For many people it is the difficult or elusive species which really
excite them and encourage their interest, as a result of which we may
find that we know far more about some rare and distant species than
we do of those that come to our own gardens. Among the European
finches the crossbill has always been the exceptional species, erratic
and eruptive in its movements and often furtive and unseasonable
in its nesting; and this is one of the species that attracted the author.
His field studies were mainly devoted to the Scottish bird but he had
also watched the Common Crossbill in breckland, and in the present
volume he combines his own extensive studies with other information,
published and unpublished, to produce a monograph of the European
forms, with additional data from Siberia, Asia and North America
to an extent which rather invalidates his subtitle.
He uses the name "pine crossbill" for what we would call the
Parrot Crossbill, and refers to the Scottish bird as the "Scottish pine
crossbill" (with lower case initial letters for proper names, I regret
to say). The link between bill-size and the type of conifer seed most
extensively eaten is obvious and perhaps justifies the name; the
Common Crossbill being apparently a Spruce specialist. The name
does however suggest stronger affinities between the Scottish Crossbill
and Parrot Crossbill than is usually recognised. The book discusses
the relationship and origin of the various forms in both the earlier
chapters and in an appendix by Alan Knox, but the suggested solution
of treating the European birds as three species is not wholly convincing.
The author is particularly interested in the nesting of the birds,
and much of the text is devoted to various aspects of nesting be-
haviour. Most of the statistical data are relegated to tables at the
end of the book and the author's great virtue is his ability to communi-

cate some of his enthusiasm and to bring the text alive, describing
the birds in the context of their habitat and the species with which
they share it. This may lengthen the text at times, however, and the
blow-by-blow account of days of observation at a nest, in an appendix,
seems a little self-indulgent; but in the main text the frequent recourse
to personal experience and observation enlivens the flow of facts.
In addition to the information on the various aspects of the breeding
period there are also good chapters on voice and food. Discussion of
distribution and irruptions deals largely with the British Isles but
gives interesting correlations between breeding, irruptive behaviour
and the state of the conifer seed crops. There is also an excellent
series of photographs of the birds, but I do not share the author's
enthusiasm for the single colour plate by the late George Lodge.
There is much valuable summarised information as well as statistics
in the appendices and tables, and a useful selective bibliography. In
summary, I think this is a useful and informative book with enough
personal touches to make one conscious of the author in the back-
ground, and to share his pleasure in these birds.

Hatching Waterfowl Eggs by Incubator
I was interested in Mr. Smith's letter in the last number of the
Magazine and am grateful to him for the trouble he has taken in
consulting commercial hatcheries. I want to make it clear, however,
that I was not asking whether cooling eggs was necessary, for I am
quite sure that it is, in spite of what commercial hatcheries say,
especially in the case of still air incubators, but it should be controlled.
A point I was trying to make is that, just as in natural incubation
there is a difference between the Phasianidae and the Anatidae in
that the latter cover the eggs with body down while the former
leave them uncovered, so in artificial incubation different methods
of cooling should be employed.

The fish owls are a group of large owls entirely confined to the Old
World. Physical dissimilarities permit them to be easily divided into two
genera; the three African species belonging to the genus Scotopelia lack ear
tufts and have quite well developed facial discs, whereas their four Asian
counterparts of the genus Ketupa have pronounced ear tufts, but have less
prominent facial discs. The Asian species, with their ear tufts, mainly
rufous coloration and large size closely resemble eagle owls; indeed for
many years they were included in the genus Bubo. However, the Asian
fish owls do differ from eagle owls in three respects. Their legs, like those
of most other species that snatch fish from the water, are coarsely scaled
and devoid of feathers, the only exception being Blakiston's Fish Owl that
does have feathered tarsi. They also have less pronounced facial discs and
the feathering lacks the fimbriated edges and is much coarser than that of
eagle owls. Presumably, as much of their prey is aquatic, a silent approach
is not so important as it is to a species that preys on mammals and birds.
The species depicted in R. David Digby's excellent plate is the very rare
Blakiston's Fish Owl. The coloured plate portrays the single bird exhibited
in the Weston Underwood collection of our member Christopher Marler.
This specimen was received from a Japanese Zoo in exchange, and it is
possibly the only example in a western zoo at the moment.
Text books give Blakiston's Fish Owl's length as 510-610 mm., but I
would estimate that Mr. Marler's bird is larger than this, 700 mm.
probably being more accurate. Certainly its large size, the pronounced
taper of the body towards the long neck, its small head and huge bushy ear
tufts give it a spectacular if rather bizarre appearance.
Four races of this owl are recognised; the nominate form Ketupa b.
blakistoni was described by Seebohm in the proceedings of the zoologi-
cal society of London in 1 883 and it is said to be resident on the islands
of Kunashiri and Hokkaido. The subspecies karafutonis was first recog-
nised by Kuroda in tori in 1931. This race is found on the Island of

Sakhalin, south of the Tym River. Seebohm also described the sub-
species doerriesi in the bulletin of the British ornithologists' club
in 1895. This race is apparently confined to the Ussuri River south of
Vladivostock. Lastly the subspecies piscivorus is known only from the type
locality in western Manchuria and was first described by Meise in ornith.
MONATSHER, in 193 3.
Unfortunately, little is known of Blakiston's Fish Owl in the wild: it is
thought to be resident in its range in spite of the very severe winters that
affect much of the area. One can assume that if the diet consists mainly of
aquatic prey, then the vicinity of fast flowing rivers that remain free of ice,
would provide the only suitable territory for winter occupation; however,
since fish owls readily accept mammals and birds as food in captivity and in
some instances even seem reluctant to take fish, it is quite possible that the
diet in the wild is not confined entirely to aquatic life. As well as taking fish
in flight in the manner of an Osprey or a sea eagle, Blakiston's Fish Owl is
said to wade into shallow water to hunt for crabs and crayfish.
In common with many other large owls, Blakiston's Fish Owl reportedly
nests on the ground. I have been unable to trace further details of the
nidification of this species, but the better known Brown Fish Owl Ketupa
zeylonensis lays from one to three eggs and the Javan Fish Owl Ketupa
ketupu both at London Zoo and in my aviaries never laid more than one egg
in a clutch. The pair of Javan Fish Owls that I owned, which were both
bred from the same pair at London Zoo, showed a pronounced size differ-
ence, but unlike most owls, the female was the smaller of the two. I am not
sure if the size difference of my pair was an individual peculiarity or if this
is a characteristic of the fish owls.

Aratinga leucophthalmus
By C. Allaway (North Walsham, Norfolk)
I purchased a "pair" of White-eyed Conures in August 1974, but it was
not until April 1975 that I realised that they could be a true pair, for it was
then that I saw one feeding the other. They were housed in an outdoor
aviary measuring 7 feet x 4 and 6 feet high with an enclosed shelter at the
back and on either side were a pair of Ring-necked Parrakeets and a pair of
Nanday Conures, for I always keep my birds at one pair per aviary.
The diet consisted of sunflower and hemp seed added to Budgerigar
seed mixture and such fruit as apple, pear and occasionally orange or
banana. Grit and cuttle bone are always available to the birds. In April 1975
a nest box measuring 18 inches x 12 x 12 was hung on the aviary side with
its top some 18 inches from the aviary roof; inside was a layer of peat moss
to which the birds added some wood that they had bitten off* from the
aviary framework, and during May four eggs were laid, being incubated by
the female only. After 26 days she left the clutch and took no more interest

in the nest, whereupon inspection showed that all four eggs contained dead
chicks, but in spite of that my hopes were raised, for obviously I had a true
pair.
Later that summer the birds were again seen taking chips of wood into
the nest and on August 12th the first egg was laid. After that I left the birds
as undisturbed as possible and, as before, the hen did all the incubating,
being fed at the nest entrance by her mate. I calculated that the eggs should
hatch on about September 9th and on the nth I found one chick dead on
the aviary floor, so, although the parents made a lot of noise and threatened
to attack me, I went into the aviary to inspect the nest and found one chick
and two eggs. The chick was covered with white down and all appeared to
go well until the 24th when the mother began to spend more time outside, so
I again inspected the nest and found that the chick appeared to be thin and
was having difficulty in keeping its balance. I thought at this time that
perhaps the parents were losing interest in the chick, but on October 13th,
when the nest was again inspected, the young one appeared well and strong;
the parents very much resented any approach to the nest. On October 18th
when I went to clean out the accumulation of seed husks so as to lessen
attraction for mice, I looked into the nest and found that the flight and tail
feathers of the chick were nearly two inches long, but the body was still
covered with down. On the 29th most of the feathers had grown except for
those at the back of the head and on the back. The chick left the nest on
November 15th, a day that was cold and wet, and at first it stayed on the
ground, but climbed up the wire netting to the top of the nest box and that
night, when I put it back into the nest, I noticed that the beak seemed to be
deformed with a scab on it, but after a day or two this scab dropped off to
reveal a perfect beak, so I wondered if this was usual with this species,
though, having bred Nanday Conures, I cannot recall this happening
with them. The young bird is now much like the parents except that it has
no red specks on the neck feathers; it is a strong flyer, feeds on the diet
given to the parents, but has more liking for apple and pear. No special food
was given during the rearing periods; bread and milk was offered daily for a
week, but was never eaten.
When I realised that the chance of a successful breeding was probable, I
asked Miss Rosemary Low and others about the possibility of this being the
first in this country. According to the encyclopaedia of aviculture,
London Zoo hatched young of this conure in iByi, but there seems some
doubt as to whether the young were reared. There are confirmed breedings
in the U.S.A. in 1936 and in Adelaide, Australia in 1936-37.

The Mottled Owl Ciccaba virgata inhabits the tropical and subtropical
forests of Trinidad and Mexico, south through Central and South America
to north-eastern Argentina. It is a rather variable species of which seven
subspecies are currently recognised. These subspecies vary in colour and in
size, from about 280 to 355 mm. in length, depending upon type-locality.
Those individuals found in the northern part of the range tend to have the
breast and underparts somewhat lighter in colour than those from farther
south. In those prevalent from Central America to Argentina, the breast
and underparts become tawny to fulvous. This species differs primarily
from its Old World relative, the Woodford's or Wood Owl Ciccaba
woodfordi , by having non-feathered toes. It is essentially a nocturnal
species which feeds upon small invertebrates and vertebrates. Nesting
generally occurs in April or May, with the average clutch consisting of one
to three whitish eggs that are usually deposited in a tree hollow.
The pair of Mottled Owls currently on exhibit at the St. Louis Zoo-
logical Park appear to be of different subspecies. The localities from which
they were collected are not known, and while the arrival date of one is
known to be April of 1965, the other is recorded only as having been in the
Zoo's collection prior to 1969. For the past three years they have been dis-
played in a glass-fronted exhibit, measuring 183 cm. in depth, 165 cm. in
width and 277 cm. in height. The enclosure also contains a nest box, natural
perching material and tropical plants (Diffenbachia picta ).
The nest box is located in a corner of the exhibit, approximately 236 cm.
above the floor. Constructed of 1.77 cm. plywood, its dimensions are 39 cm.
high, 34 cm. wide and 40.6 cm. deep. The entrance is 14.6 by 17.8 cm., and
directly below the opening is a 22.9 by 3.8 cm. wooden dowel rod for
perching. Peat moss was provided as nesting material.
Several infertile eggs had been produced prior to 1974, and since no
nest box was available during that time, the eggs were incubated on the
sand-covered floor. It was not until 1974 that the nest box was constructed,
and two eggs, which proved to be infertile, were laid in the nest that year.
On 20th or 22nd March 1975 the pair re-nested and produced the first of
three eggs. It was decided that the pair should have as much privacy as
possible so that the chances of nest desertion would be minimal; con-
sequently it is not known when the other two eggs were laid. Incubation
duties were shared by both the male and female, with the latter playing the
major part.
On nth May a single chick, approximately seven to ten days old, was
observed in the nest. The adults, who had been maintained on mice and
commercial bird of prey diet, were offering the same to the youngster.
Again, both parents shared in the brooding and rearing responsibilities,
and on 1st June the young owl left the nest. At that time its body was

covered with down, but its primaries and secondaries were developed well
enough for flight. At eight months of age it was removed from the exhibit
because the adults indicated renewed interest in the nest box.
It is believed that this hatching constitutes a first breeding of the
Mottled Owl. We hope that the pair will re-nest. If this occurs, less caution
will be exercised in an effort to obtain more exact data.

Glossopsitta pusilla
By F. C. Barnicoat (Johannesburg, South Africa)
It gives me pleasure to chronicle what must rank as one of the most
meritorious breedings ever achieved in South Africa and one which will
certainly be awarded the Rare Breeding medal of the South African
National Cage Bird Association. That two Little Lorikeets should have
been bred in South Africa in 1975 is indeed surprising, firstly in view of
Australia's restrictive laws concerning her avifauna and secondly in view of
the discouraging reports on this species even in Australian avicultural
literature. These reports range from "Another species difficult to keep in
captivity; there is no authentic record of it ever having been bred while
caged" (Cayley 1938) to "Although seldom kept or bred in captivity, the
Little Lorikeet does well if housed in a spacious, well planted aviary and
cared for in the same way as the Rainbow Lorikeet" (Forshaw 1969). In
1973 Alan Lendon said "This bird is very uncommon in captivity, even in
the eastern states", but he goes on to give the data of one successful
breeding that had occurred in Sydney in 1948. As late as 1972 the Avicul-
tural Society of South Australia awarded its medal to R. Rowlands for the
first breeding in that state.
When Mr. Peter Odekerken, a member of the Avicultural Society,
emigrated from Australia to South Africa in 1970, he was entitled to take
with him his pets and among these was a delightful pair of Little Lorikeets.
On arrival here he found that he was not immediately in a position to house
the birds in the type of aviary he considered necessary for their wellbeing,
so in order to give them some chance of propagating, he disposed of them
to the owner of a collection of parrot-like birds in Rustenburg where they
remained in good condition for four years, but showed no inclination to
breed. In Match 1975 they were acquired by Dr. David Russell, a veter-
inary doctor who has a collection of lories and lorikeets at Bryanston, just
north of Johannesburg. In the garden of over an acre in extent he has a
noteworthy collection of birds, parrot-like being his speciality, and his
collection of lorikeets is the best in South Africa. When I visited him he
showed me the young Little Lorikeets; also two young Moluccan Lories or
Lorikeets Eos bornea and there were young Dusky Lories in the nest.
The Little Lorikeets have an aviary to themselves: it measures three feet

wide, six high and 12 feet in length. The back half forms the shelter with
asbestos sheeting on the roof and sides with a brick wall back, but there is
no front to the shelter. This aviary is one of a range all of the same pattern
and each containing a single pair of lorikeets; they face west and are
partially shaded by some large nearby trees and from the afternoon sun by
a larger aviary just in front of the one occupied by the Little Lorikeets. Dr.
Russell has a theory that these partially shaded aviaries particularly suit the
forest-dwelling lorikeets and the cooler conditions prevailing in these
aviaries perhaps account for the breeding of the Little Lorikeets after four
unfruitful years at Rustenburg which is a very hot place. The aviaries have
a deep layer of river sand on the floor of the shelter portion and the flight is
of grass left to grow naturally with a small apricot tree growing there.
Normally the lorikeets leave the grass untouched, but when the Moluccan
had young in the nest they ate a large amount of the tender grass shoots. The
sand flooring of the shelters has proved ideal, for the liquid droppings of
the lorikeets quickly dry on the sand, forming crust which is easily removed
when the aviaries are cleaned. The Little Lorikeets were given a choice of a
small natural hollow log and a nesting box of the type used extensively here
for breeding Gouldian Finches. These were hung on opposite sides of the
shelter and the birds chose the box fastened on the southern wall facing
north. The only nesting material was a three-inch layer of wood shavings
and the birds merely made a slight hollow in this in one corner. When the
young had left the nest it was found to be remarkably clean: it has some-
times been suggested that charcoal should be put into the nests of lorikeets
to help to absorb the liquid droppings or that holes should be drilled in the
base of the box, but Dr. Russell's experience with both this species and the
Moluccan Lorikeet is that they are exceptionally clean nesters. He has
found that lorikeets are sensitive to disturbance at nesting time, so his
birds are fed from a small door at the aviary front, water being supplied by
means of a pipe leading to each separate water dish and controlled by a tap
outside. Incubation started on completion of the clutch of four eggs on 19th
August and the first chick was judged to have hatched on 10th September
when an egg shell was seen on the ground, so the incubation period
was estimated at 22 days. The lorikeets are fed on a mixture of three
teaspoons of Complan (a high protein food used for infants and invalids)
one teaspoon each of honey and condensed milk with a vitamin additive,
this mixture being added to \ litre of warm water. This is given early in the
morning and because such mixtures go sour rather quickly in hot weather,
only enough is given to last until lunch time when the second mixture of
Pro Nutro (a proprietary breakfast food something like Farex) mixed with
honey and a little water to form a paste is given. Apple is also given then
and usually this suffices for the day, but when there are young a third meal
consisting of the Complan, etc. is given. The young birds were in the nest
for exactly six weeks: for the first two weeks the parents fed mostly on the
nectar mixture and apple; during the third and fourth the Pro Nutro was
most favoured and during the fifth and sixth weeks the Complan nectar

food was preferred. The young left the nest on 22nd October: one of the
four eggs was infertile and the fourth egg hatched but the chick died at
about two days old. Throughout the breeding season the parents remained
very tame and the young on leaving the nest were also tame. For the first
ten days they were poor fliers and they were put back into the nest each
night.
The young are like the parents in plumage; one appears brighter in
colour than the other so it seems they are a pair. The adult male has a
deeper red on the face, a brighter green body and a more conspicuous and
extensive bronze shading on the nape than his mate: the hen&apos;s facial area of
red is also somewhat smaller. Naturally Dr. Russell is anxious to build up a
stock of these birds and so, if any member outside Australia happens to have
Little Lorikeets,, he would be glad to know so as to be able to exchange
experiences and perhaps some birds. At the time of writing the Little
Lorikeets appear to be about to nest again.

By Daphne Heddon Grunebaum (Hampnett, Northleach, Glos.)
I have Blue and Yellow Macaws Ara ararauna and a pair of Green-
winged (Red and Blue) A. chloroptera living in a state of controlled liberty.
The former are let out from their aviary at around 9.0 a.m. (so as not to dis-
turb late risers in the village) and they return a couple of hours later,
sometimes much earlier, and they then retire into the aviary for a siesta,
during which time they are shut in. This allows me to let out the very
aggressive pair of Green-winged who will attack the Blue and Yellow, so
must be let out alone. When they return at about tea-time, they in their
turn are shut in and the Blue and Yellow go out for an evening flight if the
weather is fine.
The Blue and Yellow Macaws successfully reared two young in 1971.
Three eggs were laid in 1973, but after a short while they had completely
disappeared. Again in 1974, eggs were laid but the 1971 young, for whom, I
had been unable to find "free-flying&quot; homes, got in and destroyed them. In
1975, the unhappy parents again were ready to go to the box, and many
fights took place with the young who eventually threw the box to the
ground. I renewed my efforts to find the right home for them and was
eventually successful.
Within two weeks of being on their own, the parents changed their
pattern of behaviour; the hen no longer wanted to go out, the cock became
very fierce and they spent a lot of time in their box. They both smelled very

strongly, the sweet, sickly macaw smell. On the first occasion I was able to
look into the box - on June 28th -1 found one egg. The peat we had put in
for nesting material had been pushed out, so we put in dry powdered wood,
together with a lump for them to whittle away themselves. On July 1st the
second egg appeared, and on the 5th or 6th the third was laid. At about this
time we noticed that they started to make a new call, a gentle call of two
notes, the lower note sliding up to the higher. This call was eventually
taken up by all the family and only ceased when the babies were nearly
feathered.
The weather was very hot and dry at this time, so we soaked the aviary
floor with buckets of water. On July 9th it rained and the cock "swam" with
delight over the leaves of the trees, thoroughly soaking the underside of his
wings; his hen never left the box, except to stretch occasionally. On July
24th, loud unforgettable "honks" were heard coming from the box and
we immediately gave brown bread soaked in milk, with glucose, and some
banana, which was taken at once, and from then on it was a never ending
stream of food in the form of sweetmeal biscuits, fruit, nuts, chop bones,
cheese, and lots and lots of sweet com, which was undoubtedly the favourite
food, and which we grow ourselves specially for the birds.
On August 1st, while the parents took a short flight, I was able to get in
and to see two large pink babies who were quite noisy, and one unhatched
egg, and a walnut for good measure! The behaviour of the cock now
changed completely. He became very friendly and was obviously bored
stiff with being on his own; he would come around on my back and as he
had given us some nasty bites in the past, I was not too keen on it, but did
not like to push him off. He would also come into the house and help him-
self to anything he could find to eat, and if I did not give him enough, he
would go up the garden and take carrots and peapods for himself. I noticed
that the birds no longer smelled as strongly as before.
By August 6th, the babies were crawling in their box: they had black
beaks and a few quills, tipped with blue, on wings and tail. They did not
appear to notice me when I looked at them. By August 28th, yellow colour
was to be seen on the neck of one; the other seemed less advanced and
weaker. They looked at me and registered fear, with open beaks and
backing away.
On September 3rd there was nearly a tragedy. For several days we had
heard a scraping noise coming from the box, which sounded as though
they were whittling away at the wood. Whilst inspecting them we had seen
that they had scraped away a certain amount of wood from the floor, but
we were not prepared for the sight which met us on this day. They had
succeeded in removing the entire thick floor, and were resting on a flimsy
piece of half-eaten formica which had been left on the underside. In this
was a jagged slit, through which protruded the leg of the weaker of the two
young, who was firmly trapped. I eased it out, while the other struck
aggressive postures; they were both very frightened, and shaking violently.
With difficulty we propped a false floor up underneath and left them to

recover, resolving next time to make a floor three or four inches thick and
lined underneath with tin. They were by now fairly well feathered, giving a
true blue appearance, but their legs still would not support them. We
remarked that by this time the parents' special call which we had heard at
the beginning of incubation seemed to have ceased.
The young were fully feathered by the end of September, but they will
not be allowed out to fly with their parents until the spring. They are
clumsy uncontrolled fliers at first, and very frightened at their first taste of
freedom. The weather at this time is, of course, often wet and very windy,
and added to this, all my macaws are chivvied during the first winter
months by flocks of Rooks, who try to drive them out of the sky and
divide them up - sometimes succeeding only too well, and rescue operations
in neighbouring villages have to be carried out. This unwelcome activity
stops at the beginning of spring, so as the first training flights are always
rather a strain on us, physically and mentally, it seems wisest to wait!

Tockus jacksoni
By Malcolm Ellis (Holloway, London)
It was during 1969, when I was staying with Mrs. Betty Roberts and her
family at their home close to Kampi ya Samaki on the west side of Lake
Baringo, Kenya, that I first became acquainted with Jackson's Hornbill. It
is not uncommon there and lives, usually in pairs, among the scattered
bushes and trees of the surrounding country, which is desperately dry for
most of the year. Among many species sharing the habitat with Jackson's
Hornbill is the very common Red-billed T. erythrorhynchus and, in places,
the Yellow-billed Hornbill T. flavirosiris; also the rare Hemprich's
Hornbill T. hemprichii. Williams (1972) states that Von der Decken's
Hornbill T. deckeni occurs in the Lake Baringo area: I have not seen it on
the west side, but suspect that it may replace Jackson's to the east of the
lake.
At the time of the visit in 1969, Betty Roberts was at the final stages of
hand-rearing what was then a well-grown young Jackson's Hornbill. It was
perfectly tame and would accept food from anyone prepared to offer
something it liked. I had the opportunity to take a number of photographs
of this bird and one was later reproduced on the front of cage and aviary
birds (18 June, 1970). When I was there on another occasion, a few years
ago, Betty Roberts obtained two Jackson's Hornbill nestlings: one came
around Easter, while I was away from Baringo, and by the time I returned
was quite well-grown, but I was present when the second bird, a small
nestling, arrived. The latter is shown in my photograph, taken about five
days after the nestling came, when it was small enough to fit easily into a
hand, and was, I estimate, 25 - 35 days old. The first of the two birds.

which was housed with several young Red-billed Hornbills all about the
same age as itself, was soon feeding on its own, but the other needed to be
hand-fed for some while, a task I undertook during the early stages.
While I was living with Tim and Jane Barnley, near Kitale, Kenya, I
took a part in the hand-rearing of another small nestling; this one had
belonged to the pair of Jackson's Hornbills that have since bred so success-
fully at London Zoo and it was taken from a nest they had near Kongelai,
West Pokot. Jackson's Hornbill is found there along with the Red-billed
again and also the African Grey Hornbill T. nasutus.
These young hornbills were taken from nests to be hand-reared under
the provision of capture permits issued by the Kenya Game Department
whose regulations allow birds to be caught for zoos, bird gardens and
scientific institutions, but not dealers.
They proved relatively easy to rear: all were mainly fed with raw
minced lean beef, or occasionally goat, mixed with chopped hardboiled
egg and chicken/duck mash; sometimes finely chopped lettuce was added
and sometimes the mash was replaced by a home-made softbill food. The
minced meat constituted 80-90 per cent of the mixture which was moulded
between the fingers into small egg-shaped pellets that the birds could
comfortably swallow. It was supplemented by mealworms and grasshoppers
and, though not specially relished, diced banana and paw-paw. If the food
was held between the fingers and offered to the hornbills, sometimes they
would take it and, grasping the food in the tip of the bill, would juggle it
about into a good position, then toss it back and swallow it; otherwise the
bill was carefully prised open and the food pushed well down the throat.
While small, the nestlings were fed throughout the day at intervals of
around one hour: these were gradually extended as the nestlings grew
bigger and a dish of food was left with them to encourage them to feed
themselves, which they did by the time they were able to fly.
In view of the lack of information about the juvenile plumage of
Jackson's Hornbill and doubts about the exact relationship between
Jackson's and Von der Decken's Hornbill, it was interesting to find the
four Jackson's grew blackish-brown and white plumage, just like that of an
adult Jackson's Hornbill, including, as can be seen in the photograph, a lot
of white spotting on the upper wing-coverts. The last feathers to fully
develop were the long slim tail feathers.
It was some while after the plumage was complete before the bill
reached its full length; the four birds each possessed a black bill and were
therefore all females. The small nestling shown in the photograph,
obviously had a very dark coloured eye like an adult, whereas a colour
transparency I have of one of the others, taken just after it had started to
fly, shows that it possessed a light, silvery-grey eye. The bare skin around
the eye of all four birds was blackish: the adults I have seen also had
blackish skin, not blue, as plates in some books indicate.
Until the young hornbills began to perch, each was housed in a box
that had hay lining on the floor, where they squatted in a similar posture to

the one shown in the photograph, only normally, the tail - what there was
of it - was held up against the back-presumably an adaptation to cramped
conditions in the nest hole!
It is evident from the photograph that, compared to the nestling's
scanty feathering, its black legs were fairly well developed at an early age.
Brown (1975) suggests their "strong legs" not only enable Tockus nestlings
to clamber up the inside of the nest chamber to escape possible enemies,
but back up to the opening so they can forcibly defaecate out of it. When
the female (who had thrown out the droppings) on renewing her plumage,
breaks out and helps the male to collect the increased amounts of food,
especially small animal life, needed to feed the young, they, although only
partly fledged, re-plaster the nest entrance using their dropping and items
of food, etc - a remarkable piece of behaviour on the part of the young
hombills.
* The female Jackson's Hornbill had already broken out of the nest when
the single, partly fledged, nestling was taken. About the size of the one in
the photograph, it was at first housed in a box which at the front, had a
strip of wire along the top. From the first day the bird fed very well, yet 3-4
days later no droppings had been found, and this caused some concern;
however, an explanation was soon discovered - the droppings were
plastered around the edge of the wire-covered opening. During the fol-
lowing days a close watch was maintained and the nestling seen plastering
its droppings around the opening. It applied them with the tip of the bill,
which invariably had some white excreta caked around it. Later still, when
the bird was older and a dish of food was placed in the box, some food was
stuck around the opening. The latter, which measured about 9x2 inches
(229 x 51 mm.), was doubtless regarded by the hornbill as the open nest
entrance and so it manifested the plastering behaviour. However, it proved
too enormous a task for one bird; it had managed to plaster less than 10 per
cent by the time it had outgrown the box and needed to be transferred to
a cage. Eventually it went to Birdland, Malindi, Kenya, and during 1974 I
saw it there. It had developed into a fine adult female and was sharing an
aviary with a male Von der Decken's Hornbill.
Some time after the hornbills were reared, I obtained through the East
Africa Natural History Society a copy of a paper from ibis, 1940, entitled
Hornbill Studies , by the late R. E. Moreau and Winifred M. Moreau; it is
an extremely informative account of their experiences hand-rearing four
young hombills during the 1930's, in Tanzania (then Tanganyika) East
Africa. The account relates to three Crowned T. alboterminatus (then
Lophoceros melanoleucos ) and a Silvery-cheeked Hornbill Bycanistes brevis
(then B. cristatus).
The three Crowned Hornbill nestlings, which were taken from one nest
and placed together in a box, soon began to plaster their droppings along
the edge of a gap left by the lid. They were transferred to a box with a
hole 2 \ inches (63.5 mm.) square cut in the side and, though they could
have escaped through it without difficulty, never made the slightest attempt

to do so. Instead, after one spent some time picking grass from the floor
and pushing it out, another started to plaster the hole with mud which had
been provided in a dish, although, the authors say that in the wild there is
no reason to suppose parents bring any material specially for plastering. At
first the nestlings used just mud, but after some early reluctance, incorpor-
ated more and more of their droppings and also food. The three, that each
showed quite a difference in their plastering impulse and ability, eventually
succeeded in reducing the hole to a width of less than half an inch
(12.7 mm.) from top to bottom. It was thought the female had only
recently emerged from the nest when the three were taken, and the oldest
was about 25 days old. They showed a remarkable disparity in size, which
the authors say is the rule in the hornbills as a consequence of irregular egg-
laying, and the two smallest died after just over three weeks. The survivor's
growth was retarded, and it was about 54 days old before it was able to fly;
10 days longer than in the wild. The authors seem undecided whether
young Tockus hornbills learn the plasting technique from the female before
she breaks out of the nest, or whether the faculty is innate and manifests
itself at a certain stage of the young bird's development. I would think the
latter, most likely. By contrast, the Silvery-cheeked Hombill nestling took
no interest whatever in a hole cut in the side of the box it was in; it passed
nothing through the opening and showed no desire to plaster it.

The Ring-necked Parrakeet Fsittacula krameri
I have bred the Indian Ringneck for four years now and am trying to
build up a collection of the several known colour mutations: I have blue,
lutino, fallow (red-eyed cinnamon), cinnamon, khaki and pale green forms.
I have no pieds, but pied-coloured Ringnecks are extremely common.
Occasionally an odd Fsittacula parrot becomes unable to synthesise the
black pigment (melanin) which causes it to grow yellow instead of green
feathers. Usually this affects only a few areas of the body and gives the bird
a pied appearance. This acquired piedness is very unstable from year to
year, each moult producing a different pattern and some birds even go to
the extremes of becoming completely yellow {e.g. Tavistock 1926) or
reverting to a normal green {e.g. Ezra 1917). This acquired piedness ought
not to be confused with a congenital piedness where the pied areas remain
stable throughout the life of the bird. Theoretically the difference between
the two forms should be readily made out by examining the yellow
feathers at the edge of their pied areas. In acquired piedness, some feathers
have a mottled appearance, but in the congenital form the yellowing is
uniform. I must have seen about 40 examples of an acquired piedness:
most have been male and concern not only the Ring-necked, but the
Plum-headed P. cyanocephala, the Moustached P. alexandri, the Alexan-
drine P. eupatria and I had a single example of what may well have been the
same disorder in a male Abyssinian Lovebird Agapornis taranta.
It is a common observation that parrots living on a poor diet not
uncommonly grow some yellow feathers which are later replaced by
normal ones once the diet is broadened {e.g. Knobel 1922). Parrots
managing to live almost entirely on sunflower seed, which is very low in
lysine, frequently produce yellow feathers because the formation of mela-
nin stops if the diet lacks this amino acid (Klain et al. 1957). Yet acquired
piedness frequently occurs in Fsittacula species fed on a seemingly satis-
factory diet. As this pied state often increases or makes its first appearance
with sexual maturity, it might be that there is some connection with male
hormone levels. My limited experimental breedings with such a male pied
Plumhead, at present, makes me believe that this tendency towards
acquiring a piedness is not inherited.
In 1972 I had an article in the Magazine on Ringnecks and, to avoid
repeating myself, this section only reports information not available then
and notes my differences of opinion with Lamba (1966). Confining birds
to an aviary must distort many of their activities, yet it may not always
greatly alter their breeding behaviour, for MacDonald (1961) who, like

Lamba, watched wild Ringnecks in India, saw very much the same as
myself with my aviary birds.
General behaviour
Ringnecks are very gregarious: whatever they do is very infectious to
others, so that, although most of my pairs are spaced out in separate flights,
should one pair descend to the ground then all within view follow and
likewise with bathing and feeding. This group behaviour has an unfortu-
nate side-effect and that is if one bird is nervous and gives the alarm call,
then the others, even if they are themselves indifferent to the upsetting
object, similarly shout, which makes them amongst the most noisy of my
parrots. At evening time when, were they wild, they would be swirling in
flocks around their roosts (Ali and Ripley 1969) mine have a regular ten
minutes or so of noise; and when they are breeding, some pairs at about
this time of the day, squabble at each other through the wire. It is notice-
able that most of the din they create comes from the adult hens.
Like the Cockatiel, they are savannah birds designed to fly away from
danger at great speeds and they cannot fly almost upwards and are so poor
at turning in a limited space that it is simple to catch them in an aviary. A
minute with a net and, precisely as with Cockatiels, they are either caught
or lie ready to pick up, spread-eagled on the ground.
The age of sexual maturity
I have seen young males, 150 days from hatching, making half-hearted
courtship-preening movements. They will not get the male neck ring until
their third autumn when they are approximately 2\ years old. There are
exceptions: David Castle bought two 1974 lutinos from Mrs. Betty
Partridge which, in 1975, grew their pink rings; Baker (1968), in Canada,
had a male which also grew his when only 14 months old and West (1953)
said, of Californian-bred Ringnecks, that they sometimes have theirs when
but 16-18 months old.
I wish that I knew whether the males that acquire their neck ring a year
early were hatched from very early laid eggs, because although I have now
bred more than fifty, it was not until 1975 that I had any moult in the same
year that they hatched. These particular chicks came from quite the
earliest hatch that I have had - they fledged in mid-May. Two of these are
male and I shall eagerly wait to see whether their neck ring comes with
their second moult when they are only 14 or 15 months old(?). They are
quite the most sexually precocious youngsters I have encountered and, not
having any suitable partners to demonstrate to, they display to the feeding
tray or some other inanimate objects. They have tried courting their
mother, in the same flight, but their father gives them short shrift.
Peter Paris, in Cornwall, assures me that his young invariably moult a
few months after they fledge and that his still take the usual time to get
their adult plumage, but I would be far more surprised if my precocious
chicks did not become adults by their second moult than if they delayed it
for a further year.

Ringnecks moult early: the first feathers are shed about mid-June, so by
late August or early September the entire feather system has been replaced
and only the very longest tail feathers still require a little more growth.
The precocious clutch of chicks mentioned above also moulted all their
feathers; however they started about a month later than the older birds.
Breeding
Until the winter weather of this year's January and February made me
fear egg-binding, I had stopped taking down the Ringneck nest boxes once
breeding had taken place, as the hens, sometimes their partners and
several youngsters - which I suspect are predominantly female - always use
them as roosts, not as nests, for they foul them at night and do very little
chewing of the interior. Roosting in a box stops them getting frost-bitten
feet. Once they begin to finish the moult, signs of sexual behaviour again
begin and all the current year's youngsters form pairs. The displays of the
young males are usually very half-hearted and could be missed, nor are
their pair bonds particularly strong. I have one hand-tame, talking adult
blue male who treated his hen as if she were a mere sparrow. But I am
certain that he does this because of his ignorance of hen Ringnecks rather
from bravado. Usually males are far less certain of themselves and unless
they have a protracted period of introduction, dare not start to court. In
February and March I have often seen hens, from couples paired off two or
three months beforehand, sexually soliciting and the very interested males
are too cowardly to respond and the eggs were not fertilised.
The posture taken by a sexually soliciting female is of complete submis-
sion. The back is flattened, the tail and wings slightly drooped and the
head pulled close up to the body. They periodically move the lowered head
backwards and forwards, exactly like Polytelis parrots. I do not know if a
noise accompanies this, as my observations are made through a closed
window. The spiralling movements of the head, which are said by Lamba
to be part of a female's ^courtship", have yet to be seen in my birds,
although I have often seen soliciting hens loll the head from side to side.
It is the hen that selects and excavates the nest-box and defends it with
such ferocity against other hens that, in the case (admittedly reported at
second- hand by Lamba) where two hens were alleged to occupy the same
nest, it does seem more probable that it was actually a pair in which the
male was still in immature plumage.
The African race P, k. krameri nests from October to March (Macworth-
Praed and Grant 1970) and the Indian P. k. manillensis, again depending on
latitude, from January to April, although odd pairs have been reported
breeding until July (Ali and Ripley 1969). They are so sociable that mine
even lay as a flock. For example in 1974, whereas the first pair were ex-
ceptional and laid on the 40th day of the year, the others laid on the 72nd,
7Brd, 75th and 77th day, and in 1975 the five pairs each laid the first egg on
the 39th, 43rd, 44th, 51st and 53rd day of the year. This year, at the time of
writing (late February) they have not yet started.

<bodyText confidence="0.999653782608696" page_id="56381689"  page_num="76" year="" vol="">
The number of eggs laid increases with age. My young ones in their first
laying year have three and rarely four. The older birds usually lay five; one
has even laid six. Contrary to Lamba&apos;s observations, and typical for all the
avicultural reports, the male never incubates or broods; however the
majority of mine sleep overnight in the box with the hen. The eggs get
laid at roughly two-day intervals; yet one aged "split" blue&apos;s second egg
invariably comes six days after her first.
The incubation period has twice taken only 23 days, but I would accept
24 days as being the more common interval. Resulting from my experiments
with nest-fillers and different sorts of boxes I now feel reasonably certain
that "dead-in-shell" in parrots is often the result of the eggs being subject
to frequent or severe cooling. Cold weather will add as much as four days
to the hatching time and whereas fertile summer-laid eggs usually hatch, I
find that the majority of winter-laid and cold-spring-laid eggs fail with
dead-in-shell. From weighing of hatched and unhatched eggs I cannot
attribute these deaths to desiccation.
Even if the incubation may seem to begin with the first egg, because the
laying hens often stay inside the box, the eggs usually hatch within a day or
two of each other. Growth is very variable: some chicks take longer to
"start". In my previous article I wondered whether this might have
something to do with their sex. It doesn&apos;t.
The naked chicks open their eyes when about ten days old and it takes a
few more days before they open wide. It is impossible for me to accept the
remarkable forwardness of Lamba&apos;s chicks which were said to open their
eyes at three days and look out of the nest at three weeks. Those reared by
my birds take as long as Lamba&apos;s to leave the nest and cannot eat for them-
selves until several days after they fledge, so that it is also difficult to believe
that parent wild Ringnecks, when the chicks are three weeks old, carry
large food items in the bill back to the nest for the chicks to eat. Unlike
New World parrots, if a chick should die no attempt is made to remove it
from the nest and they lie where they died.
With my birds, the briefest time from hatching until the youngsters first
leave the nest has been 46 days. The longest interval 61 days and the total
average has been 51 days. The parents take extremely good care of their
fledged young, even pushing them from behind to steer them back to the
nest or away from the nest territory of other Ringnecks.
My own birds came from India and they are usually single brooded. Mr.
Hipolite told me in mid-September last that he had a pair of blues that
were treading and gave every impression of going to nest. My own do not
usually start to copulate until late December/early January: however,
following a general article by Boosey in the foreigner, in which he said
they were single-brooded birds, Kewley (1936) wrote that by October 15th
the second round of youngsters had not fledged and Hall (1936) said that
his bred twice every year and that particular year his pair had four young in
February which were immediately followed by another reared four after
which the hen began to prepare for a third round which he stopped by

taking down the box. Rudkin (1936) also said that his pair occasionally had
a second round. Were any of these birds African Ringnecks or were they all
Indian? My own example of a second round was in 1974 when a pair raising
a single chick recommenced mating. The eggs were laid in the same box as
the 32-day old chick. To stop the eggs getting broken and filthy I put the
chick into the shelter, but on looking into the box an hour afterwards I
found it back inside. This certainly surprised me, as the chick must have
had a very difficult journey; it could not fly and the bolt-hole into the
shelter usually takes strange adult birds some hours to find, for it is half-
way up a solid wooden front. I did remove the chick twice more just to see
how very skilful the parents were in guiding it back crawling along the
wire; the nest cannot be seen from the shelter. I finally let it be and it then
fledged a fortnight later and meanwhile the hen incubated her eggs sitting
alongside her chick which she never feather-pecked. The small clutch of
three eggs never hatched, being addled.
I usually foster single chicks and sometimes clutches of eggs; therefore
certain hens have the opportunity to lay twice. I have found that when the
eggs are removed shortly after being laid, the first egg of the next clutch
comes along 11 or 12 days later. However, as copulation stops about
half-way through the incubation, if very young chicks or full-term incu-
bated eggs are taken from the nest, it always takes two or three days for
treading to recommence and now the first egg comes about 16 days after
clearing the nest. I have also found, when the well-grown chicks are
taken, that although the hen always seems to re-solicit for mating, the male
in most cases cannot restart his courtship and so there is no second clutch.
The Long-tailed Parrakeet P. longicauda
I have kept Longtails for six years and the first year they nested; unfortu-
nately a November firework that, I believe, killed the cock from fright
when it exploded on the roof during the night also caused the hen to
leave the nest, killing the three-day old chicks with cold. I exchanged that
hen in November 1975 for an immature cock. The other hen I have was
received in 1971.
Longtails have been an enigma: general opinion is that they cannot
bear the cold which would be strange, for the ten or so other Psittacula
species can. Because of this belief, I housed mine in their first winter
in a cold room; however since they have always lived in an outside aviary.
Their toes are certainly more liable to frost-bite than in other
parrots known to myself. The last few winters have been mild and they
kept their toes until this year when they have lost several, although it has
not been excessively cold. Should there be a "secret" to keeping these
birds through several winters, it may perhaps be that I do provide each hen
with a nest box that she may use as a roost and refuge. A nest box also
gives them employment and they eventually chew the inside of each
substantially-built box to splinters. In captivity they are rather sluggish
and soon become tame. In the 1950*8 the London Zoo had a caged male in

perfect condition for several years. Even well-established Longtails can be
found dead the day, or sometimes the day after a period of abnormal
excitement, such as capturing them in a net, perhaps a cat on the aviary
roof or the introduction of a strange bird having to make them re-establish
the peck order. Although these birds are usually picked up in the very pink
of condition, I believe that they have died from an acute hypertension: a
far too abrupt rise in an already high blood pressure system from excitement.
I have autopsied five, two of which were mine. Both of mine had an
atherosclerosis of the major arteries and all five were in seeming perfect
feather and very good, indeed a fat, condition. Two had filarial worms in
the air sacs and one had been dispatched live by rail and was dead on arrival.
I try to give mine something to do by providing plenty of twiggy
branches. The seed vessels are in a neutral position in the shelter away
from the territory of the nest boxes and I do my best to get them to eat
seeds other than sunflower: a diet rich in which is said to predispose to
atherosclerosis (Ratcliffe and Snyder 1965). Mine are now very partial to
pine seeds, peanuts and the male takes bread and milk; they are very keen
on fruit of all kinds.
Description
Longtails are slightly smaller than the Ring-necked Parrakeet and their
sexual dimorphism is more pronounced. The large bill is somewhat
narrower than that of a Ringneck. A male has a red bill, a black mous-
tachial stripe and a pea-green cap and the sides of the head is broadly
covered with a lovely Victoria plum pinkish-purple. The centre two tail
feathers, from which it gets its name, are thin ribbons of blue with no
white tip. Hens and immature males have brown bills, green moustaches,
a marigold-coloured blotch on the side of the face, and the tail is shorter:
otherwise both sexes are green, yellower on the belly and bluish on the
back. A good illustration of both sexes can be found in Robinson (1927). If
one has sufficient time, and sufficient birds to compare, young males can be
distinguished from hens by their marigold cheek feathers extending
slightly farther along the sides of the face and merging slightly into the
green. It is a very subtle difference to make out.
General behaviour
Although very gregarious, they are especially quarrelsome over any near
approach by a neighbour so they usually sit about a foot from each other
and any closer approach makes them show the whites of their eyes as they
pin-point the pupil and glower back with lowered head and threatening
open beak. They will, if necessary, lunge or charge at one another. No
sexual equality here; the females are very definitely the superior sex: the
courtship period is therefore extremely protracted and has been seen on
almost every day of the year.
Longtails are extremely arboreal in captivity and are most reluctant to
come to the ground whether to drink or pick up grit. They invariably

descend by climbing down rather than flying. Except in the early morning
and evening when they fly and move about a great deal, they are very
inactive unless courting.
Courtship
The courtship display has been previously described (Smith 1970) and
may be roughly summarized by saying that the females stand obeisant,
crouched with part-closed eyes; otherwise the males stand well off*. Males
probably first start by giving little stiff-legged jumps in which the body is
sometimes twisted slightly in the air so that first they face the hen with
part of one side of the body and then the other. Jumping appears to be
common to most kinds of parrot except, it seems, Australian broadtails and,
from its context on other occasions, is seems to be an intimidatory gesture -
almost a war-dance. The courting male Long-tailed Farrakeet stands quite
tall and slightly bows his head so that his pea-green cap points towards the
hen and then he sways his head in a very regular rhythm to show the hen
first one of his plum-coloured cheeks and then the other. This head sway-
ing is often followed by regurgitatory feeding when, like so many other
red-billed parrots, his head seems to be swirled round for two or three
turns just preceding feeding the hen. This swirling seems to be a combina-
tion of the usual parrot head-bobbing regurgitation and the head-swaying
of courtship. During courtship the considerable nervous strain on the male
is seen to be consistently relieved by scratching the head with a foot or,
equally out of context, by wiping or half-heartedly rubbing the sides of the
beak on the perch. During copulation the male, as has been described with
Ringnecks (Smith 1972) alternately, and very rhythmically, lifts his head
high in the air to drop the beak first on one side of the hen's neck and then
to her other shoulder. And, again as with Ringnecks, during the first few
seconds of copulation the tail may be first lowered to one side of the hen's
tail and then the other; after this copulation takes place from one side only.
Only the female incubates and each of the five clutches of eggs that I
have had has been three and they lay towards the end of the year. The
incubation period is 24 days and the chicks, very surprisingly, instead of
having a naked skin, like Ringnecks and Plumheads have a few long,
white streaks of down (sketch in Smith 1972).
With the quarantine period for parrot imports, I suppose that the Long-
tailed Parrakeet will soon become completely unknown in aviculture for,
although somewhere around 30 or 40 must have been imported annually for
the past five years or so, I doubt that more than 20 are alive at the present.
The Plum-headed Parrakeet P. cyanocephala
I have two pairs of Plumhead P. c. cyanocephala and a pair of Blossom-
head P. c. rosa. Both male Plumheads are abnormally coloured: one is
practically yellow, including its head, and has the pink feet of a lutino; the
other is of a cinnamon shade, although the black moustachial stripe is not
brown but a powdery black. I have strong doubts as to whether either

colour is genetically determined for they are, as Tavistock (1937) reported,
"unstable". During the three years that I have had the first bird, he has
been colour photographed annually and it is noticed that the pattern has
varied slightly each year. For example, last year the entire body and head
were pale yellow and now he sports a few very pale green feathers. It
certainly is not as pretty as the undoubted genetically-determined yellow
originally owned by the Keston Foreign Bird Farm and then by Alfredo
Marques and which is, I am told, still alive in the U.S.A. This bird had a
red head and flash on the wing and a yellow body.
Biswas (1951) has argued for identifying the Plumhead and the Blossom-
head as separate species, but his case is a perfect example of someone so
keen to notice microscopical differences that they omit to see the many
huge similarities. They look so much alike that I invariably have to explain
the differences to people when they look at my birds; they sound alike and
the distribution of one ends with the start of the other. Moreover, in a
genus where species vary considerably in voice and display, they seem to
have an identical courtship pattern.
General behaviour
Plumheads are quite as active as lovebirds and seem to be more skilful
flyers than the rest of the genus; they certainly are far less harsh in their
voice. Indeed in voice, beauty and easy management, they would have all
the virtues as aviary birds were they not so prone to "dead-in-shell" and
so cheap, for no-one, it seems, wants to use up an aviary on a pair of birds
unless they will produce the young that could pay the seed bill. They are
completely innocuous with other birds and seem to have no vices.
As they fly, they have a weep weep call and this is also given when they
are settled; it is noticed that the white tips to the tail twinkle with the effort
of making this noise, so attracting attention to its source. They sometimes
feed off the ground; however this is exceptional and it is my impression
that they are adapted to feed from the outermost, and therefore thinnest,
twigs of bushes and trees. However, I cannot find any information as to
their wild behaviour other than that they are restricted to wooded country.
Breeding behaviour
Like Ringnecks, the males do not get their adult colour until they enter
their third year, but after the first moult males noticeably have a trace of
"plum" over the grey of the head. This distinction can only be made in the
hand, for the difference is slight.
Males court in their juvenile plumage, starting half-way through their
first moult i.e. mid to early-September. Males walk away from the hen
(hens are the more dominant) and every so often they give a little jump into
the air. The beak is often pushed along the perch during this jump-walk.
The next stage is head swirling which usually is preceded by a bout of
jump-walking which this time has led to the male standing next to the hen.
His head is held low and slightly to one side, and it is swayed slightly so

<bodyText confidence="0.971631860465116" page_id="56381694"  page_num="81" year="" vol="">
that the back of the head faces the female. Sometimes males fly from one
end of the flight to the other and drop next to the hen by rising just before
landing, and the wings are held open just for a fraction to show the blue
underside. During courtship the males trill a rather musical song which
is later wildly chanted whenever the hen appears or disappears into her
nest box. At about this time, a month or so before the hen lays, the courting
male stands with his legs rather straight so that the body is well clear of the
perch and the head is swung with such a vigour, in the two or three turns
before feeding the hen, that the whole body noticeably sways with the
whirling.
In all essentials the nesting is as for Ringnecks. The female selects the
nest site and the male may sometimes defend the site, but more usually this
is done by the female. It is she alone who excavates the nest, which is used
as a dormitory by the cock. Mine lay in early February each year and the
clutch is four eggs which take 24 days to hatch. The hen does all of the
incubation and brooding: the chicks are quite naked at hatching and take
six weeks to fledge.
The Princess of Wales' Parrakeet Polytelis alexandrae
Princess of Wales' Parrakeets are extremely well established in European
aviaries and there may well be 3-400 pairs in the U.K. alone. Because so
very little selection to get brighter colours had taken place and partly
because of poor husbandry and feeding, there are a large number of very
undersized, dull specimens. In Holland several examples of the blue
mutation exist: I know of no-one in the U.K. who has any.
Three years ago I had a pair in one of my aviaries from which I made
several notes, but somehow these seem to have become lost and the birds
were sold (to make room for my egg-eating male Port Lincoln) before I
could breed them. However, as the Princess of Wales is so interesting a
parrot from its courtship, I have gathered a few notes from recent, hurried
glances at pairs of these birds in other peoples' aviaries.
General behaviour
Princess of Wales' Parrakeets feed largely from the ground which makes
them especially prone to infestation with Capillaria and Ascaridia worms,
which pests are most likely the reason why the numbers rise so slowly
despite the species being so easy to breed. Anyone acquiring a pair would
do well to "worm" them several times before putting them into a clean
aviary, under which conditions they should remain free from these pests.
Like other equally terrestrial parrots, they cannot hold food in the foot
(some people may have exceptional birds which can). Like the two other
members of their genus (Barraband's P. swainsoni and the Rock Pebblar
P. anthopeplus ) they are very easy to tame and seem naturally confiding.
Breeding
Very probably Princess Parrakeets are able to breed in any month of the

year. Males are quite the most sexually active parrots known to myself
except for, possibly, the Budgerigar. At any time they can be seen courting
either their hen or sometimes an object such as a nest hole or a twig or even
nothing at all. Being a desert bird, most activity is shown in the cooler
parts of the day, during the very early morning or late evening. One can
often hear males calling when the light is so very nearly gone that the birds
cannot be made out except as vague shapes. Males will fly from one end of
the aviary to the other calling their particularly ringing, and far-carrying,
(p) ing, (p) ing 9 (p) ing. This "inging" is most sounded in flight, but they also
do it when perched with head stretched straight up high in the air. After a few
calls on alighting, they may take off again. They can repeat this for hours on
end. This sound appears to be restricted to the male sex: the sexual display
proper consists of the male flying up and down with the tail slightly flared
and after one or two perched (p)ing , (p)ing he will wipe his head rapidly
on the perch (rapid beak-wiping is part of the display of all the Polytelis
parrots) and may jump up and down once or twice. He then will walk to-
wards the female with the head held very high and pointing upwards.
Then comes the most curious feature which can only be described as a
rapid "running-on-the-spot" which produces a soft drumming noise. (I
have once seen a male Rock Pebblar similarly "run-on-the-spot"). This is
followed by several bowings and stretching upwards and perhaps more
running-on-the-spot; then the head is swivelled rather rapidly with the
same mechanical, metronome-like, swing of the Long-tailed Parrakeet.
The sides of the head are shown alternately to the hen, for the movement is
slowest as the cheeks come into view and most rapid when the beak faces
the hen. The pupils of the eyes are so contracted during head swaying that
they are barely observable in the rich ruby of the iris. As he swings, he may
produce a rather duck-like qua , qua $ qua. . . Putting his head next to the
female he can make a curious ticking noise in the throat: usually this ticking
noise is made while he chatters his bill rapidly as if he were cold or
stammering. Both sexes can make the rapid chewing of the jaws and the
rattling noise and I have seen hens sway the head. Females are very obstrep-
erous to males and the males consequently are very circumspect about
their wives. On the floor of the aviary males also court, but here most of the
display is jumping. Someone who kept two pairs in the same aviary found
that he had success, whereas when they were separate they never bred. I
saw these birds and the males seemed most quarrelsome one to another.
They would fly directly at one another and hover face to face for a second or
two and then return to their mates. What was most evident was that the
females were totally unconcerned; but when a female sat next to her mate,
then the attacking male kept well away. These assaults were entirely silent.

Heliomaster squamosus
By R. J. Elgar (Manchester)
The description of the male Stripe-breasted Starthroat Hummingbird in
its breeding plumage is: Crown glittering green; post-ocular spot and
moustachial streak white; throat metallic violet-red, the outer feathers
being lengthened; the upperparts bronze-green with an irregular line of
grey feathers on the rump. The underparts are dark greenish-black with a
white stripe down the centre; there are white downy feathers around the
legs and vent and the under tail-coverts are blackish edged with pale grey. The
tail is somewhat forked and the central feathers are bronze-green, the outer
ones a dull bluish-green.
A male in this plumage came to me in late September 1974, but was
imported from Brazil I would think in November 1972, as this was the last
time that this species was imported into England. The bird was in excellent
health when I received it and had just finished its moult. I kept it with nine
other medium-sized and larger hummingbirds in an indoor flight 14 feet
long and 4^ feet wide where it soon settled and within two weeks began to
sing and display. In the first week of July 1975 I noticed several new

feathers in its gorget: the feathers were blackish edged with white and
within a fortnight the whole of the violet-red gorget was replaced by these
scale-like feathers as shown in the accompanying photograph. The irides-
cent green feathers of the crown were replaced by dull grey ones and at the
same time the bird had a full moult, but did not lose any flight feathers until
the gorget was completely out of colour. By early September the bird had
nearly completed the moult; the grey feathers of the crown and the scale-
like throat feathers were replaced by the metallic green and violet-red ones
to bring the bird back into full colour.
Ruschi (1973) mentions the Blue-tufted Starthroat H.furcifer as having a
non-breeding dress and says that Heliomaster is the only genus in which
this occurs, but that is not so, as pointed out by Mobbs (1975) who quotes
Johnson as recording it in Thaumastura cor a and who describes it in the
case of Calliphlox amethystina , the Amethyst Woodstar, a specimen of
which in my collection had three eclipses in almost four years, A Long-
billed Starthroat H. longirostris in my collection also had an eclipse
plumage, but whether this in H. squamosus has already been described I do
not know. Mr. Mobbs thinks this is the first instance observed in captive
Stripe-breasted Starthroats.
The song of this species is a monotonous chr chr chr tss and some days my
bird will sing almost continually. The display will start with this song and
the bird will then leave its perch and fly up and down the flight very
quickly, snapping its wings until it finds a perched bird to which to
display. It will then hover in front of and slightly below the other humm-
ingbird showing its enlarged gorget and green crown, all the time moving
up and down with extremely jerky movements and making a buzzing noise.
It will eventually take hold of the other bird's throat or breast feathers with
its bill and will hang there, still singing, until the other bird takes flight.
The starthroat will then chase it until it settles again and the display will
start over again. I have found this bird to be extremely aggressive towards
some of my other hummingbirds, especially the female Green-fronted
Lancebill Doryfera ludoviciae and the Bronzy Hermit Glaucis aenea and I
had to remove the Long-billed Starthroat whose song and display is very
similar to that of the Stripe-breasted.

By J. Delacour (Cleres, Seine Maritime)
The three species of Lophophorus constitute a very special genus of
pheasants not closely related to any others. They are heavy in shape and
sturdily built with short square tails and strong bills and legs. The males
are graced with magnificently iridescent plumage: females and young are
brown.
Monals live high in the mountain forests and they are found all along the
Himalayas and in western China. There are three species of Lophophorus:
the two easternmost, L. Vhuysi and L. sclateri have very seldom been kept in
captivity, but L. impeyanus has long been established, particularly in
England and France since the middle of the 19th century. It is widespread
today in European, American and other countries' zoos and aviaries. The
Impeyan Monal is found in the Himalayas east to Bhutan and Tibet at
between 8,ooo and 15,000 feet. Sclater's Monal almost comes into contact
with it in the easternmost part of the range, but it is not yet known how
close. The Chinese Monal {Vhuysi) occurs quite far from the other two and
to the northward in Yunnan and beyond. Both the latter species have
become, it seems, very rare. They would be wonderful additions to live
collections of game birds and their establishment under controlled condi-
tions could be most important in order to constitute reserves and to safe-
guard the existence of probably threatened species.
I have never seen Sclater's Monal and the only specimen kept in cap-
tivity lived in the London Zoo in 1870, but I have watched a pair of
Chinese Monals in the late Leland Smith's collection at Fair Oaks, near
Sacramento, California, in 1936 and later. I had two females at Geres from
1938 until 1940. They are almost twice the size of the Impeyan, but the
male's metallic colours are not quite so bright and the female is greyer and
darker; all the same they are marvellous birds. None, so far as I know, have
been reared in captivity.
Impeyan Monals live and breed well in pheasantries. They dig a great
deal with their rather long bills, but never scratch the ground with their
feet. They walk jerkily and they are rather brisk in their actions, flying
strongly if heavily. The voice is high pitched and whistling. The bright
iridescent upper plumage of the males is contrasted with the dull black of
the underparts and the light chestnut tail. Females and young Impeyan
Monals are very different from the adult males (who assume their full
plumage in the second year) for they are finely streaked and marked light
and dark brown with a pure white throat. Young males can usually be
identified early as they are larger, show some dark spots and lines on the
throat; their stronger legs often have developing spurs, always absent in
females, and a few metallic feathers appear on their upper plumage in the
first year.
Being mountain birds, they are rather susceptible to infections and they

must be kept on clean, well-drained and dry soil. They are extremely hardy
and easy to feed, requiring a good deal of green food. Very destructive to
grass and continually digging, they need roomy pens with good open
shelter. Monals stay well at liberty in a park, but we could never keep more
than one mated male even in a very large space, for they chase and kill one
another when associated with females, although unmated males will agree
fairly well together. Two or three females with one male will breed
satisfactorily if space is sufficient.
It is idle to discuss the relative beauty of pheasants, for everyone can
have his own choice, but there is no doubt that monals are among the most
brilliant birds of the world.

Pionites leucogaster
By R. E. H. Mann (Denton, nr. Peterborough)
Ever since my wife and I first saw Mr. George Smith's Black-headed
Caiques P. melanocephala , we have unsuccessfully tried to obtain a pair of
these very tame and oddly-coloured parrots. In early April 1975 Mr.
Smith was kind enough to lend what he hoped might be true pairs of both
Black-headed and White-bellied Caiques. The pairs were put into adjacent
aviaries and each given both an outside and an inside nest box. We are here
only concerned with the White-bellied, but both pairs, although they
examined the outside boxes, roosted and the White-bellied eventually
nested in the inside ones. Nailed to the inside of each box were as many
broad battens of wood as I could fit in. The caiques would probably have
chewed themselves out of their boxes a dozen times over if it were not for
diverting their attention to these strips of wood.
The male is the nominate formP. 1 . leucogaster that, until February
1975, belonged to Mr. and Mrs. Frank Waite. His previous mate, now
dead, once reared a hybrid with a Black-headed Caique for the Waites. This
male is extraordinarily tame, even for a caique, and always contrives to get
as close as he possibly can to human beings when he hangs in front of them
suspended only by his bill from the wire. Hanging thus he gabbles away in
a soft whisper which is supposed to be Spanish: to me it sounds plain
"double-Dutch". This male seems so tame and confiding that he practic-
ally obliges one to stroke and fondle him, to which caressing he will not
show the slightest objection: alas he is treacherously spiteful and camiot be
trusted. A former owner has a long scar on his left fore-arm where this
bird bit and refused to let go, for if he can get a chance to grab hold with
his foot or bill then he bites hard. White-bellied Caiques are rather uncom-
mon in captivity and it is therefore particularly easy to trace his previous
history through six different owners, from which I estimate that he must be
at least fifteen years old.

The hen is a five year-old Yellow-thighed Caique P. /. xanthomeria.
Originally she had been on loan, from Mr. Smith, to Mr. and Mrs. R.
Grantham and was later exchanged for another White-bellied Caique in an
attempt to provide a true pair. This hen, as is so often the case with parrots,
is not as tame as the male; she will take fruit from the fingers and does not
fly off if approached slowly by people that she knows.
The caiques, White-bellied and Black-headed, are so often illustrated
(e.g. Prestwich 1955, Bates and Busenbarh 1969, Low 1972, Forshaw
I 973 )j it might therefore suffice to say that they are of about Starling
Stumus vulgaris size, with short tail and of a stocky appearance. The back,
wings and tail are a deep holly green while the belly and chest are white.
The white is soiled-looking, even in caged individuals, as it is only the
margin of the feather that is white, the greater part being pale yellow (the
same "middle" part of the white feathers of Black-headed Caiques is
grey). The top half of the head and the nape of the neck are apricot.
Except for having yellow "trousers", most members of the yellow-thighed
race differ from the white-bellied race by having the naked, flesh-coloured
skin surrounding the eye very heavily and irregularly smeared with black;
exactly as if they were wearing mascara and then had cried - smearing it
patchily over the pink skin. The feet are also black and an odd toe-nail is
white. The White-bellied have the bare skin around the eye and the legs
and feet flesh-coloured with white toe-nails, while the thighs are green.
The very marked differences in the pigmentation of the bare parts of these
two subspecies does seem not to have been previously reported. It might
also be noted that the outer iris of both the geographical races of the
White-bellied is a very much more 'anaemic 5 red than the bright ruby one
of Black-headed Caique: likewise the innermost portion of the iris is pale
grey and not black as in the last mentioned bird. This difference is not
shown by Cooper in Forshaw (1973).
Caiques are extremely poor flyers: they whirr through the air just like a
Starling after it has had a too generous bathe in water. They give the
impression that for them to fly a hundred yards would be an impossible
feat. If this is so, then it is not surprising that caiques have split up into
five geographical races (most say two species have divided off into five
further subspecies); however, like Smith (1971) and Low (1972), I regard
the Black-headed and the White-bellied Caiques as being but geographical
races of the same species, differing only in the amount of black deposited in
the skin, iris, bill, toe-nails and feathers.
The white-bellied "species 55 is found in the (higher?) Amazonian rain
forest south of the river Amazon; the nominate White-bellied ranges from
the east coast inland and the Yellow-thighed eastward from the eastern
slopes of the Andes. Sandwiched between these two is a third, P. /.
xanthurusy which has yet to be imported and sounds most attractive with
its yellow rump and tail. Descriptions of this last subspecies do not men-
tion the colour of the feet or facial skin.

R. E. H. MANN--WHITE-BELLIED CAIQUES
General behaviour
This has been described by Smith (1971). Both sexes threaten by
screaming and whirring of the wings but the males also have a self-
important, swaggering walk. They also take little jumps and fly upwards in
an arc with whirring wings to drop vertically onto a perch; or they bow very
low and with blazing eyes accompany this movement with a low growling;
or they walk along a perch with the head lowered and the body and head
feathers fluffed, the wings not drooped and the tail only slightly flared.
Sometimes they whistle a piping toot as they upstretch their wings over
their backs revealing their orange "arm-pits". The wings may also be
upstretched silently. The above patterns of behaviour are very probably
diagnostic of the male sex. In plumage, brightness of colour and body
size, allowing for individual variation, the sexes are identical. Caiques
always roost in pairs in a box and when resting during the day sit close
next to one another and appear to preen almost any part of another's body.
The tame male is often noticed on the aviary floor turning over the litter
and perhaps searching for grit.
Breeding
From the first night that we had our two they slept together in the nest
box, although previous to our having them they were complete strangers to
each other. The very next day they were preening one another and the
male was feeding the hen; a week further on and they were mating in the
invariable one-footed way of American parrots.
The hen soon began spending much of her daytime in the nest; perhaps
the male did as well, but that would be difficult to tell, for the moment that
he hears anyone approach he comes straight over to them. My wife could
not resist looking into the nest box whenever she caught the female off and
discovered the first egg, laid in the early afternoon, on May 30th. The
clutch was three and the interval between the eggs about three days. This,
the first time she laid, the male was not a bit possessive towards the nest
and the hen sat well, remaining on the eggs even when the front of the box
was removed for examination. Halfway though the incubation she was
caught off and my wife then had the opportunity to water the nest with
warm water and to notice that all three eggs were fertile. A tray of water was
put in the shelter to raise the humidity: the eggs were watered once more
before hatching with the hen still sitting, for she absolutely refused to
budge. Mr. Smith tells me that he can tell from the first day of laying when
his Black-headed Caiques have eggs, as throughout the incubation, the hen
constantly whines to be fed by the male. I did not often hear this wheedling
noise from the White-bellied hen.
The disappointment of not finding a chick, on the 27th day from the
first egg being laid, increased with each day: then on July 1st we found that
one had hatched, 26 days after the last egg was laid. Our greatest disap-
pointment still had to come, for two days later the chick had gone without a
trace. The two remaining eggs measured 32.5 x 24.7 mm. and 33.7 x 23.6

mm. and each had a full-term dead embryo: the eggs were sent to the
British Museum (Natural History) at Tring.
The hen did not foresake her nest and continued to brood and to chew
about the interior. I managed to catch her out once or twice which allowed
me to reline the inside of the box with fresh pieces of chewing wood. She
laid again on July 30th, exactly two months from the beginning of her first
clutch and on what must have been one of the warmest days of the year:
again the clutch was three. The male, with this clutch, became more
defensive and one had to be very careful in changing the food pots.
The weather was exceptionally warm throughout August which shor-
tened the incubation and on the 23rd calling was heard and a chick found.
The second hatched on the 26th and the last egg on the morning of the
29th: as the eggs were laid at approximately two day intervals, this gave a
24-day incubation.
Feeding of the chicks was easy: the parents sampled everything that we
offered including bread dipped in milk, cheddar cheese, lory nectar food.

apples, orange, hemp seed, peanuts and the usual parrot mixture of seeds.
The fat, white-downed chicks grew slowly at first. Having lost the single
chick of the first clutch so mysteriously, we had intended removing the
cock just before the anticipated time of hatching (returning him once the
chicks were well grown) as we assumed, knowing his taste for human
flesh, that he had eaten it. However, the precocity of the hatching took us
by surprise and we completely forgot. The morning inspection on the
4th of September revealed that the two smallest chicks had gone.
According to Mr. Smith, American parrots differ in several ways from
the Old World parrots and amongst their peculiarities may be that they are
more likely to eat their dead babies. If the dead chicks are small, they
completely eat them; the larger chicks get chewed about the head, less often

the body, which might make the owner assume that the parents had killed
them. He also tells me that it may be unwise to put closed-rings on the legs
of the chicks for, again quite unlike most parrots, the American ones will
remove strange objects from the nest and, in his experience, they have torn
legs off chicks trying to free them from a ring.
The same evening that the two disappeared, the remaining chick,
because it had no food in its crop, was taken away for hand-rearing. It took
its meal very readily and was put in a metal hospital cage heated by
electric light bulbs under its floor. In the night it crawled out of the nest
onto the hot floor and died. The chick weighed exactly 20 grams and is
shown in the drawing. It may be noted that, like other American parrot
chicks, it has no visible ear openings. If there is a next time, we shall very
probably try to hand-rear the chicks from the time of hatching.

By Rosemary Low (New Barnet, Herts)
Grand Cayman is situated in the British West Indies, 180 miles west-
north-west of Jamaica and about mid-way between that island and
Yucatan in Mexico. It is the largest of the islands which comprise the
Cayman group, approximately 23 miles long and averaging about five miles
wide.
A few words on the background of the islands may be of interest.
England acquired them by treaty in 1670: the population, coloured and
white, originated from wrecked sailors, freed slaves and American and i
European immigrants, especially Scots. Today, nearly half the expatriate I
population of 3,000 consists of Jamaicans, yet 15 years ago expatriates
numbered only 100.
My interest in Grand Cayman stems from the fact that it is the home of
the Cayman Parrot Amazona leucocephala caymanensis and that very few
parrots have such a small range. Possibly the only one with a smaller
range (excluding the Cayman Brae Parrot A. 1 . hesterna ) is the nearly ex-
tinct Puerto Rican Parrot Amazona vittata. However, the latter is found
nowhere else, while the Cayman is a subspecies with the Cuban Amazon
A. 1 . leucocephala . It greatly resembles the latter and there are few people

who can differentiate between the two races: one who can is the Rev.
Ramon Noegel of Seffner, Florida.
A chance remark made to my husband and I while visiting San Diego
Zoo in 1974 led to us meeting this dedicated aviculturist. We heard of his
unique achievement in breeding the Cayman Parrot and were fortunate in
having the opportunity to visit him and see the four young Caymans which
were hand-reared.
The fact that the Cayman greatly resembles the Cuban Amazon will
mean little to most people, as the latter is not well known in aviculture: a
brief description will, therefore, be appropriate. The Cayman's plumage
varies quite considerably in individuals and I believe that this also applies
to the Cuban. Both birds are very beautiful with an extensive area of deep
pink on the cheeks and throat and a white forehead. Cayman Parrots have a
turquoise wash to the underparts and rump which, I am told by Ramon
Noegel, is invariably lacking in the Cuban. The former are usually lighter
green with less pronounced black edges to the green feathers of the head
and neck; the white on the forehead is often suffused with pink or has a
yellowish tinge. There is a maroon-coloured patch on the abdomen, and
the underside of the flight feathers are a rich shade of sky blue. The tail is
one of its most attractive features, with red and light blue markings.
Ramon NoegePs enthusiasm for the Cayman Parrot was so infectious
that it led to my husband and I visiting Grand Cayman at the end of
April last year. On arrival, we immediately hired a small car; bird-watching
without it would have been very difficult, for the birds in which we were
principally interested are not to be found in the most populated part of the
island. The parrots are confined to the eastern end and keep principally to
the mangroves, of which there are over 18,000 acres.
At the end of April 1975, after four years' work by a small team, a
Proposed Development Plan for the Cayman Islands was published. This
was summarised in the magazine of the islands, the northwester, in the
May 1975 issue, and is reproduced here with permission of that journal.
Protection of the mangroves was proposed for the following reasons:
". . . the mangroves protect the shoreline and the shoreline is there
because it is protected by the mangroves...
"On the mangroves it (the Plan) says that the general attitude was that
they were a nuisance, breeding mosquitoes and increasing humidity;
however, careful study showed that there were three types of mangrove,
each serving a purpose. There were red mangroves, which were perman-
ently covered by tidal water; black mangroves, which were only affected by
high tides or heavy rain and which were the breeding-ground for mos-
quitoes ; and white mangroves which grew above normal water level but
had access to the salt water table.
"Although there might be reservations about the black mangrove, other
areas of mangrove, especially red mangrove, were wholly beneficial. Much
of the nutrient material for the North Sound originated in the swamps. The
swamps were nursery areas for many species of fish and other marine life.

They dissipated the energy of the waves and gave a high degree of protec-
tion during storms or hurricanes. They attracted rainfall. They moderated
the runoff into the sea thereby preserving the clarity of the surrounding
waters.
"The Plan states that the mangrove swamps play an important part in
the ecology and natural environment, and indiscriminate removal could
have repercussions as serious as efforts to continue dredging the North
Sound.
"The conclusion of the Plan was that 'Mangrove and forest areas should
therefore be preserved; belts of woodland and open space should be
consciously retained between developments; more care should be taken to
preserving valuable trees in existing projects and to replacing those
destroyed by careless operation of heavy equipment. 9 "
On the face of it, this would appear to be promising where the survival of
the Cayman Parrot is concerned, but the black mangroves are its main
breeding area and the Plan suggests that "there might be reservations about
the black mangrove... 99
No tourist development and very little residential development is pro-
posed for the area in which the parrots are found. Tourist development is
confined to the coast, especially at the west end of the island.
During the all-too-brief week we spent on Grand Cayman, we devoted
every morning and late afternoon to watching birds, especially parrots. On
our first morning, as we approached the area in which they are found, a
pair flew across the road some way in front of us. Even at a distance, there
is no mistaking this bird in flight; the rapid wing beat, always below the
horizontal, and the rather blunt appearance of the head are diagnostic.
We spent about an hour watching a pair feeding on mangoes in a garden.
Presumably because they were used to seeing people there, they allowed a
closer approach than the parrots we saw later in the mangroves. The
mango is, of course, a sweet, fleshy fruit with a large stone in the centre and
a hard skin. The parrots feed on the ripe fruits, those in which the outer
skin has turned from green to yellow: they leave many fruits half eaten and
are thus doing a service to small birds such as the Bananaquit which are not
capable of piercing the outer skin. On several occasions we watched these
little nectar-feeders eating ripe mango.
The mango is a native of India and was introduced to the West Indies,
especially Jamaica, many years ago. It grows wild all over Grand Cayman
and is one of the principal foods of the parrot. The fruit from the trees
growing by the roadside is apparently judged anybody's property; thus
the parrots do not have to raid cultivated trees to obtain food.
There are many almond trees, another favourite food source of this
species. On one occasion we came across a party of eight birds feeding on
the seeds or leaves of a tree which we could not identify. I broke off a small
twig and a friend on the island identified it as logwood.
The main road follows the coast, bisecting the island at only one point in
the area inhabited by the parrots. Late one afternoon we parked the car on

this road to explore an area whose appearance had promise. After walking
for about five minutes into land which was obviously swampy during times
of high rainfall, I could hear parrots calling not too far distant. As I made
my way towards the sound of their voices, a pair flew over in the direction
from which I had come. I retraced my steps towards the car in order to
fetch a pair of shoes more suitable for the rough ground. As I did so, a pair
of parrots flew very low above me; one must have been as low as 10 ft
above my head and it was a tremendous thrill to see it so close. It seemed
that the birds were as curious about us as we were about them, for they
could easily have avoided us and would, in fact, have been easy prey for
anyone with a gun.
So noisy were the parrots perched some way off that, although I could
not see them, their cries led me to the tree in which they were hidden. The
camouflage was so effective that it was not until one flew that I discovered
its whereabouts; its mate eluded me completely. As I returned to the car
my husband beckoned me urgently from the other side of the road. He had
been watching a group of eight birds feeding in the logwood, already
mentioned. Six had flown off but the remaining two were unbelievably
tame. These two did nothing more than display at us as we stood immedi-
ately below the tree in v/hich they were feeding, about 8 ft above us. It was
the wrong time of year for young birds, so I can only conclude that they
were particularly incautious young adults.
My husband tried many times to photograph feeding parrots but they
usually flew off shrieking their tinny, atypical Amazon call, when ap-
proached too closely. As a matter of fact, it is a rather pleasant noise to my
ears, almost musical in comparison with the sounds produced by some
Amazon parrots.
We never failed to find parrots in the area mentioned above: it was
impossible to estimate how many there were, but often their voices seemed
to come from every direction. However, we never saw more than eight
together at once and all those we saw were in pairs or small groups so we
knew that nesting had not commenced. We were told that they normally
start to breed at the beginning of May. Usually two young are reared,
sometimes three, rarely four. Their chief enemies are domestic cats and
snakes; thus they breed deep in the black mangroves. On more than one
occasion we saw a black snake which slithered off at great speed on sensing
our presence. The main source of annoyance to the bird-watcher is the
mosquito. We invariably went about armed with an aerosol called "Off!",
but it did not deter these vicious biters.
During our week on the island we identified 25 bird species and saw
none which we could not name - with the help of James Bond's birds of

Our favourites, next to the parrots, were the Greater Antillean Grackles

attractive. About 11 inches in length, this species is black, with a violet or blue
sheen; the pale yellow, almost white, eye provides a striking contrast to

the black plumage. The tail of this bird is distinctive, yet difficult to
describe - V shaped and wedge shaped not being quite accurate. Wherever
one went on the island, the tinny, plaintive notes of this grackle were not
far away.
In the birds of Jamaica, published in 1847 and now a rare collector's
item, Gosse stated that he could compare its voice "to nothing but the
sounds produced by repeatedly striking with force a piece of sonorous
metal, relieved occasionally by the creaking of a schoolboy's pencil upon a
slate." As the notes are uttered, it puffs itself out, throws back its head and
opens its beak wide. These birds were invariably seen in small groups;
they breed and roost in colonies.
We never tired of watching the antics of the Smooth-billed Anis
Crotophaga ani, another extremely common all-black bird. The Ani, a very
distinct member of the cuckoo family, is immediately recognised by its
beak, which reminds me of a cartoonist's representation of a parrot's beak.
Not only is it very large, but it has a very high, thin, ridge to the culmen.
The long tail accounts for almost half of the Ani's total length of 14 in.
Anis, too, are found in small flocks, usually of about ten birds and it is
amusing to see them flapping weakly along in single file. They spend much
of their time on the ground searching for food; we often saw them in the
longish grass at the side of the road, where they would also perch on the
fences. Their food consists of insects, lizards and even frogs. The nesting
habits of this species are of particular interest: a nest is shared by several
females and may contain as many as 20 eggs. It is an open structure of
twigs, lined with leaves, often situated in mangrove trees.
The only other black bird on the island is the Cuban Bullfinch Melopyr -
rha nigra. The male is entirely shiny black except for a conspicuous white
patch on the wing. I watched a male collecting nesting material and he soon
led me to the nest. It was situated in a small stand (15 ft. x 3 ft.) of almond
trees about 7 ft. high in the centre of a patch of ground which had been
burnt. The nest was at a height of about 6 ft.; we also saw the female at the
nest site, less conspicuously garbed in greyish-olive.
Much in evidence on Grand Cayman are pigeons and doves. A most
delightful little bird is the Common Ground Dove Columbigallina pas -
serina , hardly bigger than a Chinese Painted Quail Excalfactoria chinensis.
It would, I am sure, be an instant success with aviculturists were it avail-
able again: not only is it very common, but it is the most widespread of
West Indian birds.
Its coloration is drab except for the chestnut on the wings which is seen
only when it flies. It allows a very close approach, often running to avoid a
pedestrian, rather than taking to wing; its flight is low and whirring.
Every day we saw these dainty little birds running about on the beach in
front of our hotel and they were much in evidence in other parts of the
island.
Of the larger pigeons the White-winged Dove Zenaida asiatica appeared
to be the most common. About 12 in. long, it is immediately recognised by

the conspicuous white wing bar, the rest of the plumage being brownish.
Far more handsome was the White-crowned Pigeon Columba leucocephala,
which is dark grey with striking white crown and forehead. The head is
greyish-white in the female, pale grey in immature birds. Seen less often
was the Red-necked Pigeon Columba squamosa. We saw it in the mangroves,
whereas the other large doves were usually perched on the telephone
wires at the sides of the road. The Red-necked is a large bird, about 15 in.
long, mainly dark slate-grey with the head and neck dull vinaceous and the
hindneck chestnut and metallic purple.
An extremely common and conspicuous species is the Northern
Mockingbird Mimus polyglottos, usually seen running along the ground or
singing from a conspicuous perch. About 10 in. in length with a long tail, it
is mainly grey with white patches on the wings and white outer tail feathers.
It has a habit of running a short distance, stopping abruptly every three or
four seconds and opening the wings wide, like a giant butterfly, to reveal
the white wing bars. What significance this behaviour has I do not know. Is
this a way of shading the ground to assist in the search for insects ?
The Mockingbird is known as the Nightingale; it sings at night as well
as throughout the day. The song is loud and melodious, usually delivered
from a high perch. It is a talented mimic as its scientific name (which
means "mimic of many tongues") suggests. We found a Mockingbird's
nest at the end of a branch situated at a height of about 8 ft. Two to four
pale greenish-blue eggs are laid but we did not disturb the incubating hen
to see what the nest contained.
Two tyrant-flycatchers which appeared to be plentiful were the Logger-
head Kingbird Tyrannus caudifasciatus and the Stolid Flycatcher Myiar -
chus stolidus. Both are rather drably coloured but the Loggerhead is
considerably larger - 9 in. compared with 7J in. The former is brownish
above and whitish below and can be identified by the fact that most of the
head, including the lores, is dark; it has yellowish under tail-coverts. The
Stolid Flycatcher has only the crown dark, light-coloured lores and partly
rufous tail.
The cheerful, not unmelodious song of both species was frequently
heard, often when the singer was perched conspicuously at the end of a
leafless branch, from where it would make short flights after insects. Both
species apparently also take small lizards, which are abundant on the island.
While on the subject of lizards, I cannot resist mentioning the iguana
Cyclura macleayi caymanensis on Grand Cayman. Iguanas have always held
a particular fascination for me; unlike some people, who find them ugly, I
think them extraordinarily beautiful. The species on Cayman is probably
extinct in Jamaica, where it was widely eaten by the Ararwak Indians and
even sold in Kingston market for the table until the early 19th century. I
had read that a small population survived on Cayman, but this fact had
somehow got relegated to the recesses of my mind.
The day before we left, we drove to the northern shore of the eastern
part of the island, and parked in the shade with a cooling sea breeze. Even

at io a.m. the temperature was well into the 90s F. The road ended
abruptly; it was covered with sand, with low scrub on one side and the sea
on the other. I imagine that there are few visitors to this part; there are no
sandy beaches, thus no hotels.
We drove off very slowly, in order to look for birds. A few yards along
the road, my husband stopped the car suddenly. We could hardly believe
our eyes: there on the roadside was a 4 ft. iguana, an imposing beauty. I do
believe he would have ignored us, had my husband not got out of the car,
which had stopped about 3 ft. from the iguana, in order to photograph it. It
turned and moved off quickly into the low scrub, where we could not
follow, but not before it had threatened my husband with nodding head.
Elated at this sighting, we returned to the spot we had left and parked in
the hope that the iguana might re-appear. It failed to do so but another,
smaller iguana came out to sunbathe on the road; however, it did not allow
a close approach. Once again we returned to park under a tree and waited -
but two iguanas was to be our total.
We did not realise how fortunate we had been until we mentioned the
incident to a friend: his reaction was one of incredulity. "I have spent 30
years on the island and have never seen an iguana - and you are here a
week and see two! 55 He told us that even scientific expeditions had failed to
find the iguana.
We also enquired about the Grand Cayman Thrush Mimocichla ravida f
found only on Grand Cayman. Attracted by the illustration in birds of the
west indies, we kept a lookout for it whenever we visited the eastern part of
the island, and we showed our friend the illustration and asked whether he
knew the bird. He told us that he believed that it had not been seen for
about 30 years; it must therefore be feared extinct. Not unlike our Black-
bird in size and stance, it is depicted as being entirely grey with white
abdomen and under tail-coverts and bill, feet and bare eye ring of coral red.
One morning, on our way to the turtle farm, which lay at the opposite
end of the island to that we visited most often, we added two new species to
our list - the Mangrove Cuckoo Coccyzus minor and the American "Red-
start 55 Setophaga ruticilla. The former, known locally as the "Rain Bird 55 , is
a handsome species about 12 in. long. It is grey above with black ear-
coverts; the underparts vary from whitish to pale brownish-yellow. The
single bird we saw was in low bushes a few feet from the sea. The American
Redstart is an extremely striking little bird. We saw but a single male of
this ill-named warbler, darting about and flirting its handsome tail. The
male is mainly black with bright orange patches on the sides, wings and
tail, with some white on the underparts. Apparently, the female is olive-
brown above, whitish below, with yellow instead of orange patches.
We often parked in lonely places to watch birds which inevitably led to
any Caymanian who passed enquiring whether our car had broken down.
The islanders are very friendly, helpful people but it seems that few have
any interest in the native birds, and we usually hesitated to explain our
true purpose!

There was one bird on the island which vociferously objected to our
presence - a Black-winged Stilt Himantopus himantopus which inhabited an
area of shallow brackish water, where we often saw Great White Herons
Ardea occidentalis. The latter would flee as soon as they saw us but we were
able to observe a Tricoloured Heron Hydranassa tricolor from a distance
although it, too, was very cautious. The stilt was one of a pair which was
probably nesting nearby and circled above us screaming, almost resorting
to "dive-bombing" my husband when he approached the water to photo-
graph the scene.
Late one afternoon, following the calls of the parrots in the mangroves
which, when I found them, did not allow a very close approach, I came
across a beautiful Stripe-headed Tanager Spindalis zena which was not
at all shy. About 7 in. in length, the male has the head and wings boldly
marked in black and white, in contrast to the bright yellow of the under-
parts, with a touch of red on the upper breast. The female has the head
grey and the wings grey and white, with yellow underparts. This species
has a wide distribution in the West Indies and has been imported on a few
occasions.
The same afternoon I was foolish enough to leave my cine-camera in the
car, thus missing the opportunity to film a West Indian Red-bellied
Woodpecker Centurus superciliaris which flew towards me, perched in a
tree about 8 ft. away and unconcernedly carried out his drumming.
Woodpeckers' voices were a familiar sound, but we seldom saw the birds.
A small, brightly coloured bird which appears on one of Cayman's
stamps is the Yellow Warbler Dendroica petechia. On several occasions
we saw this species in trees or bushes a few feet from our moving car: it did
not seem at all shy. The male is golden yellow, streaked with chestnut on
the underparts. Finally on a single occasion we saw a Belted Kingfisher
Ceryle (Megaceryle) alcyon perched on a telegraph wire. Grey-blue above,
including the crest, and white below, it has a broad bluish-grey band across
the chest.
Grand Cayman is an island which I will always recall with affection and to
which I hope one day to be able to return.

OBSERVATIONS ON SOME HUMMINGBIRDS
OF MARTINIQUE
</sectionHeader>

By Johan Ingels (Destelbergen, Belgium)
During a visit (22nd and 23rd Amgust 1974) to the island of Martinique
(West Indies), I had the opportunity to observe the hummingbirds living
around the Hilton hotel. This hotel is situated on top of a steep cliff,
approximately 20 m. above the Caribbean sea, at the entrance of the
Fort-de-France bay and near the Route Nationale N.2, connecting Fort-de-
France and St. Pierre.
In the hotel's well kept gardens and grounds which descend to sea-level,
three hummingbird species occur, all of which are endemic to the West
Indian archipelago. In these gardens flowering shrubs and trees are
abundant, e.g. Bougainvillea , Delonix , Heliconia 3 Poinciana and Hibiscus
species.
The hummingbird species observed in this drier part of the leeward
side of the island were: Antillean Crested Hummingbird and Green-
throated and Purple-throated Caribs. The Purple-throated Carib comes
only occasionally to man-modified habitats at sea-level (Diamond 1973).
The other species regularly occur in the lowlands of all Lesser Antillean
islands; also in the dry forest areas (Wolf and Wolf 1971; Lack 1973;
Pinchon 1963).
Antillean Crested Hummingbird Orthorhyncus cristatus.
The subspecies observed was Orthorhyncus cristatus exilis , with a
glittering all-green crest. It was especially abundant in the tops of flowering
trees belonging to the Leguminosae, which grew alongside a small brook
left of the hotel. It was seen feeding on the flowers of dwarf poincianas
(Poinciana pulcherrima) and shower trees ( Cassia species). Several were
seen chasing each other among the nearby fruiting almond trees ( Terminalia
catappa). Bare twigs in the shady crowns of these trees appeared to be the
preferred resting perches.
After a two hour period (09:00-11:00) of observation with binoculars,
I estimated between five to seven birds were present, at least two of which
had no crest, being either females or immature. Although there was con-
tinual bickering amongst these birds, none appeared to have actual feeding
territories.
Next to the main entrance of the hotel, in the tangled vegetation around
rubber and mango trees (respectively Ficus benjamina and Mangifera
indica) lived a number of these hummingbirds. At least one of them was a
female or an immature one, having no crest as I stated when it was feeding
on ixora flowers (Ixora macrothyrsa) , 2 m. in front of me. Shaded, bare
twigs low in the mango trees were the preferred resting perches.
A single male of this species, which resided next to the path leading to
the hotel's private landing-stage, was fairly tame: its behaviour was studied
in some detail for a period of three hours (14:00-17:00), together with that

of a male Purple-throated Carib Eulampis jugularis. Its normal resting
perch was a bare twig of a golden trumpet bush ( Allamanda cathartica),
approximately i Jm. high and overshadowed by a tall flowering cannonball
tree (Couroupita guianensis). This particular male was seen feeding on the
nearby flowers of Hibiscus, Bougainvillea, a golden trumpet bush and the
cannonball tree and on the very small flowers of a climbing herb. The nectar
in the deep calyces of Hibiscus and A llamanda flowers are inaccessible to such
a short-billed hummingbird; however, I observed the male taking nectar
through a narrow hole in the base of the corollas of these flowers. This par-
ticular feeding behaviour had already been observed for all three humming-
bird species mentioned in this paper, at the "closed" flowers of the pepper
hibiscus (Malvaviscus arboreus) (Pinchon 1963). Although I did not
observe this Antillean Crested Hummingbird actually piercing corollas, I
believe the perforations were made by the hummingbird itself. Bananaquits
Coereba flaveola , which were abundant in the hotel grounds and are known
to pierce flower corollas in search of nectar, would have made larger, less
defined perforations.
I agree with Lack who remarks that Antillean Crested Hummingbirds
normally feed from near the ground up to the canopy of tall trees, although
I too observed they seemed to prefer the former (Diamond 1973).
As to resting perches they seem to prefer bare twigs, well overshadowed
when chosen low, or in shady crowns of higher trees.
Green-throated Carib Sericotes holosericeus.
A Green-throated Carib was seen feeding several times between 07:00
and 08:00 on the flowers of Hibiscus, red ginger (Alpinia purpurata) and
Heliconia caribea, planted in flower beds around the swimming pool and
along the rear side of the hotel. Between two feeding visits, it disappeared for
approximately J hour, each time flying off* in the direction of the front of
the hotel. At 08:30 when the place became crowded with people, it no
longer appeared. Shortly afterwards, another one was seen probing the
flowers of an orchid tree (Baukinia variegata) in front of the hotel and
both birds were seen to feed on flowers from near the ground up to the tops
of low shrubs.
Purple-throated Carib Eulampis jugularis.
To the right of the hotel was a small forest, consisting mainly of flower-
ing flamboyants (Delonix regia), among which grew a thicket of tall
cactus, a few clumps of bamboo and several cultivated mangos and rubber
trees (Ficus elastica ).
The Purple-throated Caribs observed fed almost exclusively on the
abundant flamboyant flowers.
A female Purple-throated Carib, which furiously defended its own
feeding territory consisting of three flamboyants, was observed for a period
of three hours. It always fed from flowers of these trees, after which it
returned to the same perch to rest; a tiny bare twig just below the crown of
a non-flowering flamboyant nearby. On several occasions it chased a
female Purple-throated Carib occupying a nearby feeding territory. The

intruder's territory was much larger, consisting of approximately a dozen
poorly flowering flamboyants, which may have been the reason for it trying
to feed on the more abundant flowers in its neighbour's territory.
The Purple-throated Caribs were always seen feeding high up, never
descending to nearby low flowering Hibiscus. Sallies to take airborne
insects were observed, mostly followed by some nectar sipping, prior to
returning to the favourite perch.
The mentioned male Antillean Crested Hummingbird residing nearby,
entered several times the feeding territory of the first mentioned female
Purple-throated Carib to feed on low hanging flamboyant flowers, but it
was not seen to be chased.

THE LESSER ANTILLEAN PARROT PROGRAMME
AT THE JERSEY ZOOLOGICAL PARK

The Lesser Antilles were once the home of six species of Amazon parrot:
today two are already extinct and the other four are in danger of extinction,
the St. Lucia Parrot Amazona versicolor most gravely. For a long time these
beautiful parrots have been much sought after as cage birds. Mr Sydney
Porter wrote about them in glowing terms in this journal (1929), making
particular reference to the Imperial Parrot A. imperialis of Dominica.
Always extremely rare in aviculture, they are far too scarce to justify
their inclusion in the aviaries of the over zealous collector. Today, their
only place in captivity is in a properly controlled propagation programme.
Concerned for their survival. Dr and Mrs Nichols of Texas, U.S.A.,
started just such a programme for all four species of Lesser Antillean
parrot. Due to the vital role this could play in their conservation, the
Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust and S.A.F.E. (Save Animals From
Extinction) International, its sister organisation, gave the programme their
backing and have worked closely with the Nichols so that captive populations
can be established both in Texas and Jersey. Initially the J.W.P.T. are
concentrating on the St. Lucia and St. Vincent species and thus repre-
senting the J.W.P.T. the author spent from April to July 1975 in the
Antilles, principally on St. Lucia, assisting with field studies and securing
specimens for the captive phase of the programme.
The St. Lucia, one of the largest Amazon parrots, measures about 43 cm.
in length and is approximately the same size as the St. Vincent A. guildingii
although rather slimmer in build. As in the St. Vincent, there is considerable
variation in the plumage. The forehead, lores and cheeks are cobalt blue,
blending to light green on the crown, extending to green throughout the
nape, mantle, rump, tail- and wing-coverts. The feathers of the nape are
heavily edged with black, the rest more lightly. Four secondaries have a
vermilion outer web, which form a bright speculum when the wings are
extended. On the upper side the primaries are royal blue on the outer web
and black on the inner; underneath the wings is pale blue-grey.
On the underparts the greatest variation occurs: some specimens have an
extensive scarlet throat patch, in others there are just a few red feathers or
none at all. The breast, abdomen and thighs are pale green thinly edged with
black. Those of the breast and abdomen, in most birds, are blotched with
dull pinkish maroon, sometimes almost obliterating the green. Under tail-
coverts are pale green with a tinge of turquoise around the vent. The tail
feathers are black at the base on the underside and pale green towards the
tip; on the upper side royal blue extends for the greater part of the length
giving way to a pale green tip. The lateral tail feathers have a patch of red
on the inner web at the base; the bill is largely grey, the iris orange, the
periophthalmic ring is pale grey and the legs and cere dark grey.

The Jacquot, as it is known locally, is endemic only to St. Lucia, an
island 238 square miles in area, and is restricted to the rain forest of the
mountainous interior. It inhabits a region of some 25 square miles which is
dominated by Mome Gimie (900 m), the highest peak in St. Lucia, with
many lesser peaks and ridges which slope steeply down to bolder strewn
ravines. The population is in the region of 125 specimens and its present
range extends from Millet and Mt. La Combe in the north to Grand
Magazine in the south, as far as Mt. Houlemon in the west and Mt.
Beucop and Calforc in the east.
The forest is most beautiful, many trees are bedecked with a mass of
epiphytes. It is moist and often dripping with the frequent rain showers.
Little sunlight penetrates the dense canopy, the floor having only scanty
growth. The parrots spend most of their time up in the canopy; conse-
quently they are difficult to see from the ground. The dense foliage has few
gaps and those 'windows' that exist only give restricted vision; even from
the tops of the ridges and peaks it is not possible to see much. Thus the
very nature of their forest home hampers any detailed study of this rare
bird considerably.
Most of the forest is a reserve, set aside largely as a catchment area to
conserve the island's water resources. Some inroads are still being made
however, with clearance for shifting cultivation continuing, illegal plots are
found well into the forest; some lumbering takes place as well.
The avifauna is relatively poor in regard to the number of species that
occur; although the parrot is perhaps the most beautiful of the forest
birds, a number of interesting species are to be found. Few of these are
known to aviculture to any great extent. The bold humming birds are
particularly numerous and endlessly fascinating. The Trembler is a
curious species, sombre brown with an elongated downcurved bill, its
wings are frequently draped and trembled, hence its name. The dainty
little Bridled and Ruddy Quail Doves are delightful birds, occasionally
encountered foraging among the debris on the forest floor, but more often
their plaintive soft cooing is the only sign of their presence.
Our search for the parrot began in the northern part of the forest, using
the agricultural rest huts at Millet as our base. A parrot was seen on our
first day out in the area; a memorable experience to encounter such a rare
species in the wild. Our searches of the forest in the north revealed few
parrots. Nowhere were they abundant, except early one morning when a
flock of twenty was observed flying over the Dame de Traversay ridge. In
the south we were based at the Quilesse forestry hut, isolated in the heart of
the forest and accessible only on foot along a narrow muddy path. The
parrots were markedly more abundant in this region and consequently
most of our work was carried out here. We were able to locate two nests in
these parts and although the breeding season, which coincides with the
dry season, was well advanced when we discovered them, some new and
interesting data were obtained. This aspect is an important part of the
programme, for the knowledge gained from field studies is useful to create 1

improved conditions so as to maintain the species successfully in captivity
and of use in constructive conservation in the wild.
One nest was at a height of 18 m. in a Gommier tree Dacryodes excelsa.
When first examined on June 6th it contained a well developed chick,
which we removed the next day before it had a chance to fledge. The second
nest was in a Bois Pain Marron Talauma dodecapetala 21 m. up where a
bough had broken off and a cavity had rotted out. A single chick was also
found in this nest, less developed than the other. We left this in the parents'
care for a while longer but examined it regularly, collecting data on its
development and making observation on behaviour at the nest. The parents
were easily distinguishable, one a very colourful specimen, the other
practically green, usually visited the nest about three or four times during
an eight hour observation period. Arriving together flying silently into the
branches near the nest, one would enter the cavity while the other perched
quietly nearby before they changed over or it joined the other in the nest.
They stayed for 20-30 minutes before calling loudly as they flew off to-
gether. While a parent bird was in the nest, the chick could clearly be heard
vocalising and this often continued for a while after the adults had flown.
Tragedy struck, however: the chick succumbed to some unknown cause,
possibly due to a species of opposum, one of St. Lucia's few mammals.
This was a great setback as it left us with a single youngster, far short of
the eight or so we had hoped to acquire.
This bird did very well. It was fed on a mixture of Weetabix, Farex baby
food, golden syrup, brown bread, mango pulp or mashed banana and
powdered milk mixed into a porridge with warm boiled water plus one or
two drops of vitamins. At first it was a little reluctant to feed, but it soon
accepted the mixture being pushed from the end of a finger into its beak. It
was fed four times a day, the first feed at 06.00 and the last at about 18.30.
To begin with it was kept in a small wooden box but was later transferred
to a cage constructed specially for it.
There is a clear pattern of daily activity; flying and calling as they dis-
perse from roosts to feed soon after first light. Around mid-day they are
extremely quiet and inconspicuous. Activity starts up again in the late
afternoon and towards evening as they return to roost. During rain little
activity is noticeable. A definite outward movement in the morning and
return to the centre of the forest towards dusk is apparent but how widely
they travel throughout the range during the day is difficult to tell. Usually
they are seen flying singly, or occasionally in pairs or threes. One group of
four was seen, containing at least one young recently fledged.
Food appears abundant, the birds eating the fruits of several of the
forest trees and palms, even venturing into secondary growth to feed on
some plants: our list of species fed upon is far from complete.
The author flew to St. Vincent for a week in May to meet Government
officials who had kindly given permission for four St. Vincent parrots,
already in captivity, to come to Jersey; there are extremely tight restric-
tions on the export of parrots from the island. Some time was also spent

observing the species in the wild; it is somewhat more plentiful than the St.
Lucia Parrot and tends to stray into open land a little more, but is likewise
restricted to what remains of the rain forest. The author returned to St.
Vincent for the last few days in the West Indies to crate and settle the four
parrots ready for the journey before boarding the banana boat. This boat
docked in Port Castries the next day where the young St. Lucia Parrot was
picked up. The birds travelled extremely well and it was not until on the
voyage home that the St. Lucia Parrot began to feed for itself.
All five birds were quickly at home at the Jersey Zoo and have come
through their first winter with no trouble, staying out under close observa-
tion during all weathers. A second St. Lucia Parrot, sent on breeding loan
from the Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo, has been a welcome addi-
tion to the programme.
The greatest threat to the St. Lucia parrot's survival almost certainly
lies in continued hunting. Slaughtered mainly for the pot, the few pet
birds around the island are mostly those who recovered from injuries when
shot, deliberate efforts sometimes being made to obtain a pet parrot in this
fashion. Therefore no real moves were made to obtain any of the pets for
fear of encouraging this practice. Such birds are often damaged in some
way and so perhaps are not ideal for breeding. Laws exist prohibiting the
hunting of parrots and also the keeping of pet ones. These laws are hard to
enforce and are no real deterrent at present.
Adult parrots have few, if any, natural enemies. There are several
predators on the island that may take eggs and young but there is no proof
they do so. At one nest a Pearly-eyed Thrasher was seen to fly to the
entrance and it is known on other islands that these birds take eggs and
young and even compete for nest sites.
The parrot's future also rests on the rain forest. Much has already been
lost, and continues to go, due to lumbering and clearance for shifting
cultivation. St. Lucia must carefully protect its forest; it is vital for its
water supply and of course, for the parrot. Those areas remaining must
provide adequate habitat, particularly in regard to nesting sites, so that a
healthy population can be sustained. Areas should be set completely
aside for the parrots and a wildlife division should be formed with properly
trained wardens who are given sufficient powers to clamp down on hunting,
coupled with a proper forest management policy, to aid its conservation.
Uncertainty must hang over the future of the St. Lucia Parrot. Thus if a
reserve of captive bred specimens could be built up, its survival would be
safeguarded. Now is the time to start a captive breeding programme before
the species becomes almost inevitably rarer. It is hoped that removing a
limited number of specimens over the next few years, ideally as feathered
nestlings, will have a minimal effect on the wild population.
It can only be hoped that present trends can be reversed and the parrot
will once again flourish; however in the event of extinction it will not be
lost for ever if a reservoir of captive-bred specimens remains.

By Bernard C. Sayers (Chelmsford, Essex)
I, like Dr. Harrison in his list of breeding records (crows to touracos),
do not claim that the breedings cited are necessarily "firsts". I have dis-
counted accounts where vague terms such as "have bred" or "have nested"
are employed, as in many instances authors seem to have used these
phrases when describing nesting attempts involving eggs being laid and
perhaps hatched, but no chicks being reared to maturity. I have concen-
trated on locating records that leave little doubt that chicks were in fact
reared to maturity: however it is quite possible that some of the earlier
records that I have discarded were completely successful. It is probable
that I have failed to trace a number of published accounts of successful
breedings of birds of prey and I would therefore be grateful if Society
members would notify me of any omissions in my list. Records so far
published in the Magazine have followed the sequence Passeriformes to
Struthioniformes and have been in numbered parts. This part is not
numbered because it is sequentially out of place.

At the end of August, 1975, we received a pair of the Bornean Rhinoceros
Hombill Buceros rhinoceros borneoensis, a large black bird with white tail,
ivory-white bill surmounted by a massive red and yellow casque. In the
male the casque has two "horns" and in the female one, but this is not the
only difference to be seen in the sexes, for the irides of the male are red and
of the female white. This bird inhabits the sub-montane forests, living
singly or in pairs in the tops of trees 150-200 feet from the ground, feeding
mainly on fruits. These newcomers make eight species of hornbill now
exhibited in the Bird House.
Every year in December the number and species of the animals kept in
the Berlin Zoo are checked. This time, the stock was as follows: On
December 31st, 1975,1,177 mammals of 260 species and 2,834 birds of 711
species in addition to 4,788 invertebrates of 257 species, 2,543 fish *f 685
species, 555 amphibians of 99 species and 634 reptiles of 303 species.
Altogether 12,531 animals of 2,315 species were living here at the end of
1975 and this collection was seen by 2.4 million visitors.

In 1962 when the new Bird House was completed, the Berlin Zoo
received four Keas Nestor notabilis. They were put into an aviary measuring
about 3x3m. with a hollow tree trunk and branches lying on the ground
and with a small pool where fresh water is always running. During all the
years the birds never made any attempt to nest, but in March 1975 when

the number was reduced to a pair, another hollow trunk was fixed upright
in the ground and soon after this the male, identifiable by a yellowish cere
and yellow circle around the eyes, and his mate became very interested in
this trunk and entered it through a hole about 50 cm. above the base.
After eight days three white eggs had been laid and the female brooded
them for 12 days and then lost interest in them. Two of the eggs were
infertile and the third contained a dead embryo.
This year the first egg was laid on March 24th and as we did not disturb
the birds and as the male became very aggressive, we did not inspect the
nest to see when the rest of the clutch was laid, but after 27 days, on April
20t h, a chick was hatched. When it was 78 days old it left the nest for the
first time.
Normally the food consists of a mixture of seeds, nuts, cooked rice,
potatoes, maize, carrots and other vegetables, fruit, beef and horse meat.
Vita Kalk and a multi-vitamin. Additionally we now give hard-boiled egg,
rusk, minced beef and freshly cut grass. This is the first breeding success
with Keas in our Zoo, and naturally we hope that it will not be the only one.

KEEPING A PARROT IN THE FAMILY. By Rex A. Harper. Published

Basically purchasers of imported birds can be divided into two cate-
gories ; pet owners and those who keep birds for breeding and/or exhibi-
tion purposes. Those in the latter category, often having had a long interest
in birds, usually have a fair idea of how to care for their acquisitions, but
pets are frequently bought on impulse by well meaning but totally ignorant
individuals.
Of the commonly imported birds, it is undoubtedly the members of the
parrot family and to a lesser extent mynahs, that prove most popular with
pet owners, presumably because of their powers of mimicry. I have often
wondered how many imported parrots are lost during their first few months
in this country, but I suspect that it is a very significant proportion. This
can probably be attributed to two main causes; the very delicate nature of
freshly imported parrots and ignorance on the part of some owners. To a
certain extent the new quarantine regulations, if properly applied, will
mean that parrots offered for sale will be less likely to be diseased, which
leaves the problem of ignorance for which the best remedy is education.
Unfortunately many of the books published on parrots are aimed
principally at the collector and in the main consist of myriads of detailed
descriptions of the numerous species; also, being bulky books, they are
unavoidably expensive and unlikely to appeal to a pet owner. However the
book under review is exactly what is required, for the text is lucid but
simple and concise, the content is sound and the price reasonable.

Mr. Harper is obviously a sympathetic parrot keeper with considerable
practical knowledge of the species commonly kept as pets. The disadvan-
tages of keeping parrots in the home are as cogently explained as the
advantages; also the unsuitability of some proprietary cages is discussed. I
was particularly pleased to note that a varied diet is advocated and ex-
plained in detail. "Seed-eater" is a misleading term, as very few birds live
solely on seed and certainly the species of parrots kept as pets both need
and enjoy a wide variety of fruit, vegetable, salad, meat etc.
In conclusion, I would recommend this book without reservation to
owners or would-be purchasers of pet parrots. If all pet parrots were
treated exactly as suggested by Mr. Harper, I feel certain that in general
they would be happier and longer lived than is at present the case.

The Curator of Birds at East Berlin Zoo, Dr. Wolfgang Grummt,
reports that some 30 forms of owl are now represented in the collection,
including ten forms of eagle owl and four races of Barn Owl Tyto alba .
Avicultural rarities such as the Bay Wood Owl Phodilus badius , Malaysian
Eagle Owl Bubo sumatrana , Great Grey Owl Strix nebulosa and Hawk Owl
Surnia ulula are exhibited. Several species have bred successfully including
Boobook Owl Ninox novaeseelandiae and the Rusty Barred Owl Strix
hylophila } the latter believed to be the first captive breeding.
Barham Zoo has an unusual Kestrel Falco tinnunculus , for it has the
colouring of a male, but has proved its sex by regularly laying eggs. It has
the typical grey head and grey tail with black and white terminal bands,
though the tail is faintly cross-barred. Although a tiercel is housed with
this bird, none of the eggs have been fertile.

R. E. Comhill reports that his female Sparrow Hawk laid three eggs from
the perch during the spring of 1975 and then laid a further four in the nest
built by the male. The female died suddenly after two weeks of incubation
and all the eggs contained partially formed embryos. Examination revealed
that she died from aspergillosis and a calcium deficiency was thought to
have been a possible contributory cause of the bird contracting the
aspergillosis.

two chicks when the captive bred bird was only 11 months old and in
November 1975 the female laid seven eggs, but as she was having difficulty

Mr. P. S. M. Smith's pair of Turkmenian Eagle Owls excelled them-
selves in 1975, laying in February and having chicks about half-grown when
a severe blizzard came. As the nest was on the ground and unprotected
from the snow, the chicks were removed to save them from being buried
and were hand-reared. The parents started again and produced a second
clutch, all chicks being reared. This gave a total of nine chicks from the one
pair which has produced 14 young in three years.

Writing in British birds (1976, vol. 69, no. 4) Mr. Robert Hudson
reviews the history, biology and status of the North American Ruddy Duck
Oxyurajamaicensis as a feral bird in Britain, for this species was admitted to
the British and Irish list in 1971. The first of these feral birds flew off from
the Wildfowl Trust's collection at Slimbridge in about 1952-3 and the first
breeding occurred in i960. Apart from a setback in the severe winter of
1962-63 the wild birds have increased to an estimated 50-60 pairs in
different parts of the country and at the end of that (1975) summer to an
estimated total of 300-350 birds. The feral Ruddy Ducks in winter tend to
congregate on large reservoirs, particularly those in Avon and Staffordshire;
otherwise they frequent suitably deep meres and pools where there are
sufficient areas of emergent vegetation. Ruddy Ducks in 1975 were nesting
in eight or nine counties.

Mr. Malcolm Ellis writes :-
In February, I received a letter from a fellow member Mrs. Barbara
Glover, who with her husband Michael, has Birdland at Malindi, Kenya.
The letter contained the news that at the third attempt, a pair of Crowned
Hombills Tockus alboterminatus have successfully bred. The female broke
out of the rather unusual nest (in a gourd) on 22.1.76, and two young on
11.2.76. Five days later, when the letter was written, the parents were
continuing to feed the young who had made no attempt to feed themselves.
They were getting paw-paw, banana, meat and biscuit meal mixed with
boiled egg. The two young were only very slightly smaller than the parents,
with their bills a paler colour and their eyes almost cream, instead of yellow.
Barbara Glover comments, "It was very interesting, that during the
whole period the male was feeding the female and then the young in the
nest, he never ate one of the grasshoppers, given each afternoon, himself.
Also, the female did not feed the young for the first day-and-a-half she was
out of the nest".
The letter added that there were two broods of Allen's Gallinule
Forphyrula alleni chicks in the "Walk in" aviary. Birdland, which is on the
coast of Kenya has a fairly large collection of mainly East African birds
which I wrote about in the Magazine, Vol. 80, No. 6, November-December

Dr. Jean-Marc Lernould, a Veterinary Surgeon, writes from Nieul-le-
Dolent, France, that he has bred a considerable number of Hartlaub's
Ducks. He obtained the parents from Gabon in 1972 and the female laid
two clutches, each of 10 eggs, in September and October 1975. These were
artificially incubated and 18 ducklings hatched, 16 of which were success-
fully reared and are thriving.

British birds (1976, vol. 69, no. 4) contains a paper by Dr. H. Mikkola of
the University of Finland which summarises the published records of
European owls killing and sometimes eating or being eaten by other
species of owl or by diurnal birds of prey. The Long-eared Owl is the most
numerous prey of Great Eagle Owl and of Goshawk. The paper does not
consider the records of diurnal birds of prey killing each other, but the
tables include the killing of Goshawk, Buzzard and Kestrel by Great
Eagle Owl.

Hand-list of the Anseriformes
Mr. Holyoak invites comment on his hand-list of the Anseriformes (A.M.
1975, pp 221-228). It seems to me that the ideal common name is one that
is descriptive of the bird - its plumage or voice, habits, habitat, distribution
and so on. Naturally some consideration should be given to the most com-
monly used name in the bird's native place, but the Australian name for
Tadorna radjah - Burdekin Duck - has little to commend it, for Burdekin is
a river in Queensland, so the name is inappropriate for a species that
ranges into New Guinea, the Moluccas and other islands to the northward
of Australia as well as far beyond the Burdekin River in Australia itself.
Grass Whistling Duck is scarcely an improvement on the existing Eyton's
or Plumed Whistling Duck, particularly as 'tree duck' is the most commonly
used group name.
There is a good deal to be said for self-indexing, though it could some-
times mean separating closely related species - for instance Biziura lobata y
the Musk Duck, is away from the other Oxyurini and so is Thalassornis
leuconotus , the White-backed Duck, though in this latter case I feel that,
after having read Johnsgard on the species and talked to friends, this is an
aberrant whistling duck and not a stifftail.
If Polysticta stelleri really is an eider, it is placed far from the typical
ones - rightly, I think, as it happens, for it seems not much like them and a
friend of mine who reared some from Alaskan eggs found them very un-
eider like and in behaviour more like ducklings of Harlequin H. histrionica.
Steller's Duck would be a more fitting name.

I was interested to read Mrs. Eileen Yates' notes on a White-eared
Barbet (A.M. 1975, p.197) in which she says that there is no record of
captive breeding of this species. I bought two of these barbets in 1971 and
kept them at first in a mixed collection of small insectivorous and seed-
eating birds, together with two species of coly and two of hanging parrots;
also two Crested Mynahs, Thick-billed or Grosbeak Weavers Amblyospiza 1
albifrons and six Pied Barbets Tricholaema leucomelan.
In 1973 I built 12 long narrow indoor flights and one larger flight and into
one of the smaller compartments I put the White-eared. They were supplied
with rotten branches and trunks and in 1974 they excavated two holes, but

did not nest, so I was still not sure that they were a pair. In May 1975 I
found an eggshell on the floor and at once supplied a lot of mealworms, but
there was no evidence of living young. In July more eggshells were found
and this time more mealworms were being taken. This continued through
July and early in August a young barbet came out from the nest, but,
since it was unable to fly, I put it back inside that evening. Three weeks
later, as it did not re-appear, I sawed through the branch and could see the
chick in the nest, but found that it had a broken leg which I splinted and
bound up, but the bird died four days later. The young one was exactly
like the parents. The nest was about 30 cm. deep; there was only one
entrance and the parents did not open a second hole at nest level as
described in the Magazine (1975,121-130) in the case of the Red-headed
Barbet.
The sexes of the White-eared Barbet are so alike in appearance that if I
had to distinguish between these two, I should have to judge by the pubic
bones which are apart in the case of the female in my aviary and close
together in the male. My pair do not utter a sound except as I enter the
aviary when they make a loud scream; when they had the chick, they made
a dove-like cooing, but only when they saw me. Their food consists of an
insectile mixture, various fruits and mealworms. They sometimes during
the winter, are given some of the meat mixture that I give to woodpeckers,
starlings and laughing thrushes and they like it; also a variety of insects
whenever obtainable in the summer. The Pied Barbets, which roosted
together in a hole they made in a branch, later nested and had eggs, but,
due to some infection, all died as well as my colies. Of my other birds

the forested parts of south-eastern Asia is, in my opinion, one of the most
beautiful of all the small members of the Phasianidae. In the autumn of
1973 I obtained a fully acclimatised pair and in the spring of 1974 their
behaviour, especially that of the male, changed from shyness to compara-
tive boldness and I saw him carrying small twigs to a corner of the aviary
where, within about three days, he built a domed nest, lining it with
bamboo leaves. The finishing of the interior was done by the female who
shaped it so that it fitted her body, only her head being visible at the
entrance, and a few days later she began to lay her glossy whitish eggs,
about 3 cm. in length, laying every second day until a clutch of six was

completed. She did all the incubation and after two weeks I tested the
eggs, finding five of them fertile, and on the 23rd day they hatched. The
chicks grew well, but during the third week two died, an examination
showing a navel infection, probably contracted at hatching time and taking
about 20 days to run its course. A second clutch of only three eggs, all
infertile, was laid and from a third of twelve eggs, eight chicks hatched
after 22 days of incubation. At the end of the season I had five young males
and three females, and by making exchanges through the kindness of
M. Delacour and of Winged World I was able to start the 1975 season with
five unrelated pairs and during that season 31 chicks were reared from the
three pairs that bred.
My Roulroul Partridges are fed on chopped apple, pear and soaked
raisins, these fruits being mixed with a meal composed of 50 per cent
poultry meal, 25 per cent meat meal, 20 per cent fish meal and 5 per cent
bone meal. In addition, the birds receive mealworms, locusts, ant cocoons
and cleaned maggots.

There appears to some evidence that ''talking" parrots incorporate
their repertoire into the mating/aggression/territorial display and that the
imitation of human sounds is accompanied by at least some of the com-
ponents of the display; e.g. Amazon parrots who contract the pupils, thus
flashing the orange of the iris, while "talking".
The subject has aroused my curiosity as possibly throwing light onto the
behavioural reasons for the imitation of sounds (not necessarily human) by
parrots and I wondered if members could help me by sending me observa-
tions on their own birds.
I would like to know:

Rare Australian Parrots
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9967076875" page_id="56381732"  page_num="117" year="" vol="">
In my opinion Mr. Barnicoat's letter does nothing to enhance the good
name of aviculture, for though he does stress some safeguards and that rare
or unsuitable species should not be collected, he is arguing that the Golden-
shouldered and Hooded Parrots should be protected from the depredations
of selfish and irresponsible aviculturists by having them kept in captivity by
just those people who are responsible for depleting their numbers in the
wild - and that it should be done officially.
I do not understand how anyone interested in nature can consider that
species whose natural habitat is under no particular threat, as in the case of
these birds, and which have no serious natural predators should be kept in
captivity at all if the avicultural demand for the birds reduces their numbers
in the wild state. To argue otherwise is a reflection on the mentality of
those who keep these birds or sympathise with those who do and who, in so
doing, bring aviculture into disrepute. The idea that people who keep such
birds in captivity are acting from the highest principles in order to preserve
threatened species from extinction is sanctimonious nonsense, for the
number of cases where a species of mammal or bird may be helped or pre-
served by being kept in captivity is very small - the Fere David's Deer and
possibly the Nene (Hawaiian Goose) are about the only examples I can
think of. Claims of extreme rarity in aviculture are often coupled, in my
opinion, with an understandable desire to keep prices high and from my
observations, which go back more than 40 years, I have no doubt that
people and zoos who keep genuinely rare animals in captivity are primarily
motivated by personal aggrandisement - the desire to possess something
rare and costly which others do not have, and if it involves cruelty or the
destruction of wild life in the process, that is not their business: it is the
responsibility of someone else.
I believe that the Society should be doing more than just produce a
pleasant and interesting publication. It should surely take steps to list
species which should not be kept in captivity and this should be incorpor-
ated in the Rules of the Society - that anyone keeping such species should
be disqualified from membership. The Golden-shouldered and Hooded

The letter from Mr. Bamicoat in the October-December 1975 number
of the Magazine made interesting reading and his suggestion that the
Australian Government follow the example of the Transvaal Provincial
Administration in allowing a small number of birds to be caught and held
at an approved station until established and then to allow a limited number
to be exported to aviculturists would be a sincere gesture of conservation.
Somehow I do not think that the Australian authorities would agree, and
what to my mind is their failing is that they allow birds to be exported to
approved zoos. I ask who have been the more successful in breeding
Australian birds, zoos or aviculturists? I submit aviculturists, and if any
birds are to be exported, it should be to them.

By Joseph Bell and Donald Bruning (Department of Ornithology)
With a total of more than 230 species, antbirds (Formicariidae) comprise
one of the largest avian families in the New World. In view of this fact it
may seem strange that so few of these birds have ever reached the collec-
tions of zoos or private aviculturists, but their general appearance, habits
and habitat preferences have all served to protect them from would-be
collectors.
Living alone or sometimes in pairs, antbirds are found in the lower part
of the forest or in thick scrub. While ants are not the principal food of all
the species, many follow ant columns, feeding on other insect life disturbed
by the ants in their march. Some forms are crested or strikingly patterned,
but most are clad in sombre tones of grey, russet-brown or black. The sum
total of all these characteristics has made antbirds difficult to find and cap-
ture and even more difficult to hold, once taken.
In reviewing bird department records here, it came as something of a
surprise to the authors to learn that since the first antbird arrived at the
Bronx in 1942,29 specimens (13 species of 7 genera) have been represented
in the New York Zoological Society's aviaries. Less surprising is the fact
that with the exception of the bird reared here, every one of these speci-
mens came to us through the efforts of Charles Cordier, a bird collector
without peer.
Notwithstanding Cordier's skill at trapping these birds and establishing
them on a captive diet, our success as a whole in maintaining them has been
poor: most survived only months, a few for several years and a single
Chestnut-crowned Ant-pitta Grallaria r. ruficapilla lived for nearly five
years. The problem seemed to be chiefly one of space and adequate cover.
The small, shallow displays in our old bird house offered little or no
seclusion for even a single specimen of these highly strung secretive birds
and, as the record shows, only a few ever managed to become well
established.
The situation was still much the same in the fall of 1968 when Cordier
forwarded the first Rufous-faced Ant-pittas G. erythrotis. There is no
visually evident sexual dimorphism in these chunky, long-legged brown birds

and although three more specimens were added during 1970 and 1971,
attempts to establish possible pairs in the cramped quarters of the 1905
bird house were unsuccessful and several of the birds were lost.
It was only after the entire small bird collection was moved to the World
of Birds that we began to have renewed hopes of establishing a pair of
ant-pittas, for the large, heavily planted exhibits in the new facility offered
the space and seclusion that seemed to be needed. In the spring of 1972,
several combinations of the remaining three ant-pittas were tried in a
circular display, with a 10 metre diameter, that featured small tanagers,
manakins, honey-creepers and pigmy kingfishers, but it was not until a
third try was made during the summer that favourable results were achieved
with two of these birds showing no aggression towards each other and even
calling back and forth as they foraged in the thick plantings near the
exhibit's floor.
Real nest-building activity began in the early fall when, after several false
starts, a rather ragged structure of small twigs, assorted leaves, moss and
other plant parts was finally completed in October. Attached to, and partially
hidden by tropical foliage, the nest was situated two metres above the
exhibit floor and measured 20 centimetres wide and 30 high with a cup a
full 14 cm. deep.
On November 1st, the nest was found to contain two pale bluish-green
subelliptical eggs that measured 28 mm. in length and 23 mm. at the
widest point: one weighed 8.8 grams and the other 9.4 grams. Unfortun-
ately, the eggs of this clutch and another discovered on December 9th all
proved to be infertile, but one of a third clutch, laid later in the same
month, contained an embryo that died during the first week of incubation.
Our hopes ran high at this turn of events but three successive clutches of
eggs laid during 1973 were all either infertile or broken, and the behaviour
of the pair was also cause for some concern: periodically one of the birds
(suspected, and later proven to be the male) would harass the other relent-
lessly. This pattern of intermittent aggression continued into 1974, when
two early sets of eggs were also broken.
When a third clutch was laid early in April, observers were posted to
keep the nest and pair under constant surveillance during the daylight
hours. For several days the situation was peaceful and incubation appeared
to be normal but then the male began to drive again with such ferocity that
the female had to be removed--she died subsequently from wounds
received in this encounter and the eggs were taken for artificial incubation.
Placed in an automatic, forced-draft incubator (Humidaire) set at a
temperature of 97.5 *F, with a relative humidity of 60-65 per cent, one
chick starred its shell on April 18th and hatched at 3.00 p.m. the following
day. The embryo in the second egg died prior to hatching.
The newly hatched ant-pitta chick was placed in a small woven nest in a
Lyons glass hatcher where the temperature was maintained at 97*F, and
the humidity at nearly 90 per cent. The chick weighed 5.7 grams and began

During the next week, the young bird was fed regularly seven or eight
times each day between 6.00 a.m. and 7.00 p.m. (see chart). Feathers began
to show on the sixth day and the eyes started to open on the seventh. The
temperature in the hatcher was lowered one or two degrees each day during
the second week as the chick's need for warmth decreased.
Small portions of water-soaked Gaines Meal (a commercial pet ration)
were added to the diet on the fourth day and, with the pieces of baby
mouse, formed the total diet during the rearing period; amount and size of
the portions were adjusted as the young bird grew.
At fifteen days of age, the chick had become very active, began leaving
the nest and hopping around the floor of the incubator. It was moved to a
large brooder and began eating on its own at three weeks of age. At four
weeks old, it was fully independent.
To the authors' knowledge, this represents the first antbird of any kind
ever to be raised in captivity.

THE 1976 BREEDING SEASON
By Rosemary Low (Barnet, Herts)
The disappointments of last year's breeding season, which outnumbered
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.9991746" page_id="56381745"  page_num="122" year="" vol="">
the successes, were described in the Jan-Mar 1976 issue of the Magazine.
This year's results with the same birds except the Edwards's Lorikeets and
plus a pair of Yellow-streaked Lories Cholcopsitta sintillata were more
encouraging. The latter did not attempt to nest, neither did the Grey and
the Purple-bellied Parrots which nested last year. Only one pair (Red-
capped Parrots) nested for the first time but three species were reared for
the first time. These included Meyer's and Iris Lorikeets, the hand-rearing
of which is described separately, and the breeding of a Bronze-winged
Parrot, also recounted separately.
The pair of Eclectus Parrots which reared one youngster last year went
to nest at the beginning of January. There was snow or below-minus
temperatures every day of the week during which the chick hatched, on the
29th or 30th. It died on the 31st--the only chick which the pair has failed
to rear to date. The most disappointing aspect of this hatching was that, on
post-mortem , the chick proved to be a female: it was to be followed by four
males!
On February 25th there was one egg in the Eclectus' nest. This hatched
on March 23rd and, when the nest was inspected on the 27th, there were
two chicks. As usual, corn-on-the-cob was the principal rearing food. It was
of interest to observe the different growth rates, the elder being one third

larger during most of the period the chicks spent in the nest. On fledging it
was only slightly larger--longer in the body than the male, in fact.
One of the youngsters was seen to look out of the nest on May 22nd; the
younger fledged and left the nest on June nth and the elder on the
following day. Neither was at all nervous, in direct contrast to the first
youngster reared by this pair in 1974. They were removed from the aviary
on July 10th, when the male--who shoulders most of the hard work of
feeding--was definitely tiring of their presence. A normally gentle bird, he
would occasionally jab at them, but without causing any harm.
On July 17th the female had one egg in the nest; once again, both eggs
hatched (August 14th and 16th). By August 21st one chick was one third
larger than the other, but as they developed, there was less discrepancy in
their sizes than in the chicks from the first nest. On September 8th the first
chick could be sexed and on the 12th those first green feathers on the
upperparts indicated that yet again we had two males! However, we were
delighted that the pair should rear four youngsters in one year when the sum
of their first two years together was only two young. In contrast, a second
pair, the female of which had been laying and incubating continuously for a
year, has still to hatch her first chick.
The Dusky Lories Pseudeos fuscata , which reared one youngster last
year, hatched a chick on or before May 22nd. It fledged on August 4th after
at least 75 days in the nest, compared with about 67 days for the 1975
youngster.
The pair of Fairy Lorikeets Charmosyna pulchella rothschildi , which
hatched a chick last year, had two clutches of two eggs, one in their winter
quarters in an indoor birdroom and the other in their summer aviary, but
unfortunately, neither clutch hatched. In this delightful little lorikeet, the
male shares incubation duties: unfortunately, this male has been ailing in
health for some months and because of this, his incubation duties were
somewhat erratic.
Our original pair of Iris Lorikeets, received in 1972, were at last success-
ful in rearing a youngster. The nest box was not at any time inspected, but
the chick was first heard on June 26th and left the nest on August 21st. It
was considerably smaller than the adults and had been plucked on the nape
of the neck. It had a most feminine appearance and lacked the violet
colouring on the crown present in the hand-reared youngster from another
pair, which is a male.
Its parents are extremely tame and, like most tame birds, will eat almost
any food offered. I feel that this is why this pair reared their youngster
while the second pair, which eat only sunflower seed, panicum millet,
apple and nectar, do not rear theirs. The successful pair also eat corn-on-
the-cob, carrot, celery, niger and canary seed, lettuce and a variety of
fruits.
The hen of our pair of Red-capped Parrots Pionopsitta pileata laid for the
first time at the end of May. The male had fed chicks on two previous

occasions with a different female, but these died at an early age. On June
27th a chick was heard, possibly hatched three or four days previously.
The nest was inspected on one occasion when the chick was about one
week old; there was one egg inside and another on the aviary floor.
Unfortunately, the chick died on July 14th; on autopsy it was found to be
badly bruised on one side of the body but there was no sign of disease. It
was a slight consolation to know that the bird was a male, for females of
this species are extremely hard to come by.

BREEDING OF THE CHINESE (LIGHT-VENTED) BULBUL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9843936" page_id="56381747"  page_num="124" year="" vol="">
Pycnonotus sinensis sinensis
By R. E. Oxley (Hornchurch, Essex)
Writing in the October 1899 issue of the avicultural magazine,
Dr. A. G. Butler said of the Chinese Bulbul--"This is a rather pretty bird,
mostly ashy and olive-yellowish above; brownish yellow and white below;
the head and neck may be roughly described as black and brown with
conspicuous white patches on crown, sides of head and throat; the wings
and tail feathers dark brown edged with yellow." This 7J inch bulbul is
apparently a common resident in and around the gardens of Hong Kong
but winters in N.E. Tonkin. Another race (Pycnonotus sinensis hainanus)
which lacks the white patch on the crown is found in S. China, Hainan and
Taiwan; and is a common resident at low elevations in North and central
Annam and Tonkin.
Since Butler described this bulbul, a few specimens were apparently
kept and exhibited successfully prior to the last World War but very few
have been available since. During the last 3/4 years, however, a limited
number of these birds have become available in the U.K. appearing on
dealers lists as, White-capped, White-crowned and Harter's Bulbuls.
It was from one of the trade stands at the 1973 National Exhibition of
Cage and Aviary Birds, that I purchased my first Chinese Bulbul. After
the initial period of settling in and acclimatization this bird was released in
a small outside aviary which contains our breeding colony of Lineolated
(Barred) Parrakeets, as at that time all our other aviaries contained various
other potential breeding pairs of softbills. The bulbul remained in this
flight during the summer and autumn and it soon reached peak condition
and began to sing--it was obviously a male.
In November 1974, a friend offered us another of these bulbuls which
was the survivor of a pair which he had bought the previous year; we lost no
time in purchasing this bird. It was obvious on placing the two birds to-
gether that the new arrival was a hen, as the original bird immediately

displayed and began to chase it about the aviary. The display was exactly as
that described by Dr. Russ in the article written by Butler in 1899. He said
that *&apos;'when chasing its mate, it hops round her either on branches or on the
ground with highly erected crest and nape feathers, drooping wings and
fan-like tail, it indeed appears to be white-headed; but then it puffs out its
entire plumage, so that it seems considerably larger than it actually is."
Both bulbuls remained in the aviary with the parrakeets until the begin-
ning of May, 1975, when they were transferred to one of our planted
flights which is approximately 9 feet x 5 feet x 6 feet high and which they
shared with two Diuca Finches and a pair of Chinese Painted Quail.
Feeding was carried out via a feeding hatch at the front of the aviary and the
food provided was the diet upon which they had been fed since their arrival;
our home-made softbill food, diced fruit (grapes, apple, pear etc.), a nectar
mixture and madeira cake soaked in the nectar. Seed was, of course,
provided for the finches and the quail.
The aviary contains an assortment of small shrubs which gave ample
protection at ground level to the quail and the finches, which spent much
of their time on the ground. Very soon, however, the whole of the front and
top of the aviary became completely covered with bindweed and Russian
vine (Polygonum) which was allowed to grow rampant so as to afford
privacy to the inmates. Plenty of nest sites in the form of boxes, baskets,
etc. and nesting material had been provided in the hope that the birds
would decide to breed. Apparently, bulbuls build cup shaped nests in the
wild and, shortly after being released in this aviary, a cup nest--built from
dried grass--appeared in the densest part of the vine. Little or no interest
was taken in this nest after its completion, although by now observation of
the interior of the aviary had become increasingly difficult owing to the
density of the foliage.
On July 22nd, whilst feeding the birds, one of the bulbuls was seen to be
unmercifully chasing one of the Diuca Finches around the aviary and the
other finch lay dead by the seed containers. This chasing continued and,
fearing for this finch's life also, I decided to remove it to safer quarters. The
capture of this bird proved to be a rather difficult operation owing to the
dense growth which made the netting of it, although successful, difficult.
Meanwhile the bulbuls screamed continuously while I was in the aviary
and, as I had disturbed them, decided to look in the various nesting
receptacles out of curiosity. Imagine my surprise and delight when looking
in a nest box which hung on the back of the aviary two small heads, on
equally small bodies, shot up from the depths of the box and began to
gape for food. Until this time I had no idea that any serious nesting attempt
had been made, let alone having any chicks, which I estimated to be
approximately 2/3 days old, so I quickly left the aviary and the shrieking
adults, taking the Diuca Finch with me.
The nest which contained these two chicks was made solely from dried
grass and was constructed in a half open wooden box 9 inches long x 5 inches

x 5 inches which was, as previously stated, fixed to the back of the aviary
about 4 feet from the ground. No live food had been provided for these
bulbuls since we received them, although we use gallons of maggots and
plenty of mealworms, grasshoppers, etc. for feeding to our other softbills
during the year. This was rectified, however, and very soon maggots,
mealworms and chrysalids were seen to be taken to the nest and fed to the
young. Observation of this nest was comparatively easy as the box which
contained it was situated away from the densest end of the flight and could
be viewed easily through the vine on the front of the aviary.
The weather had been, and was at this time, extremely hot and dry and
consequently many small insects must have been caught by the adults for
their young prior to our providing any additional live food. In addition to
the items of food already mentioned, bread and milk was offered to the
parent birds who were seen to feed small quantities to the babies. The
parents were devoted to their two young which rapidly feathered and on the
morning of July 28th, were both seen sitting upright on the edge of the
nest. That same afternoon both babies left the nest and one was seen sitting
on top of the nest box while the other perched on some vine a foot or two
away. Both birds were extremely tiny as one would expect, as they could at
the most have only been 9/10 days old. The plumage of these two youngs-
ters was grey on the head and back, darker on the wings with whiter under-
parts and a half-inch grey tail. During the following week or so the parents
continued to feed the youngsters and both were successfully reared, soon
becoming as large as the adults, moulting into full adult plumage at about
eight weeks of age. Unfortunately one young bird suffered badly from
rickets, its legs and feet being terribly deformed, in spite of taking the pre-
cauting of dusting the maggots and mealworms with powdered Vionate
during the rearing period; its nest mate was, however, perfect in every
detail.
All four bulbuls remained in the aviary until the middle of November,
when they were transferred to an inside flight in the birdroom for the
winter. I never found any trace of eggshells and so am unable to describe
them although they are said to be purple-white in colour.
According to Butler, "Dr. Russ's pair went to nest in 1893, but the first
nest was destroyed through the interference of a Porto Rico Pigeon
Columba squamosa; indeed he says he lost two broods from this cause.
Eventually the hen pigeon died and he took out the cock, so now he says he
hopes to have satisfactory results". I have, however, been unable to trace
whether Russ was successful in breeding this species, but rather doubt it.
I understand that a Mr and Mrs Peck of Cheltenham also bred the
Chinese Bulbul during 1975, rearing two young. It does appear that these
are the first two successes in this country.

BREEDING THE LITTLE RINGED PLOVER

Charadrius dubius
By L. J. Prior (Snetterton, Norfolk)
In an aviary measuring 25 feet x 10 and about eight feet high, a pair of
Little Ringed Plovers were put at the beginning of March this year. The
birds had this aviary to themselves; it had the floor covered with concrete
to exclude vermin and on this was put gravel to a depth of three to four
inches on one side of a stream which ran lengthwise through the aviary and
on the other side was put soil to a depth of about six inches in which
nettles and other weeds grew. By the end of March the male was displaying
and making nest scrapes in the gravel and when I entered the aviary he
would fly at me making a piping noise.
The birds were fed on the diet that I give to my small insectivorous
birds--an insectile mixture to which is added scrambled egg, minced raw
and steamed ox heart, grated cheese, minced green food, currants and
sultanas and a vitamin compound powder.
The first egg was laid on April 28th, but after a few days it became
apparent that the hen was not going to complete the clutch or incubate the
one egg. The male then became very aggressive towards her, chasing her
away from the nesting area, so I removed the egg and the birds settled
down. The male then lined one of the scrapes with tiny white stones and on
May 15th another egg was laid, after which one was laid every other day
until the 23rd when four had been laid and the birds started to incubate
them, both sharing the incubation and the nest would only be left if I
entered the aviary, but incubation was resumed as soon as I left. The first
chick hatched on June 16th and a second on the 17th: for a day or two the
father brooded and cared for these while the mother continued to sit on the
remaining eggs. After this time I took the eggs and found them to be
infertile.
Food for the young was a problem at first, but I scattered scrambled egg
and other food on the gravel and put into the aviary a heap of well rotted
chicken carcasses which attracted numerous small flies and other insects;
I also threw small maggots and mealworms to the birds. The young ones
thrived on this diet and by the beginning of July were as big as the parents
--in fact I removed them on July 12th whilst they could still be distinguish-
ed from the adults.
As described, the Little Ringed Plover Charadrius dubius has been bred
by Mr. L. J. Prior and this may be the first success in this country. Anyone
knowing of a previous breeding of this species in Great Britain or Northern
Ireland is asked to inform the Hon. Secretary.

Ninox novaeseelandiae boobook
By Bernard C. Sayers (Chelmsford, Essex)
The genus Ninox comprises a group of hawk owls that occupy the
Oriental, Malagasy, Australasian and eastern Palaearctic regions and the 18
species included in this genus vary in size from the Philippine Hawk Owl
Ninox philippensis at 150-200 mm. to the Australian Powerful Owl, which
at 630-650 mm. occupies the ecological niche associated with eagle owls in
other parts of the world. The species novaeseelandiae is sub-divided into
numerous races; Peters (1940) lists 15 and Mees (1964) lists 16. All these
races inhabit Australia, New Guinea, New Zealand, and adjacent islands
and many are isolated island forms.

ORNITHOLOGY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988778230769231" page_id="56381752"  page_num="129" year="" vol="">
Said to be common throughout most of the wooded and settled districts
of New Zealand, although numbers have apparently decreased in areas
where the introduced Little Owl Athene noctua has become established.
Diet in the wild seems to consist mainly of moths, beetles, spiders etc.;
although some pellets examined have shown that lizards, small birds,
particularly House Sparrows Passer domesticus , rats and mice are also taken.
A hollow tree is usually chosen as nest site; more rarely it is situated in the
fork of a tree or on a platform such as that provided by a bird's old nest.
Breeding takes place between October and November and the clutch
consists of two or occasionally three eggs.
The vernacular name of Morepork is an onomatopoeic derivation from
the call which is most commonly heard. Some observers state that "quor-
coo" is a more accurate likeness to this call. A more prolonged "more-pork-
pork-pork" and a scream which is mostly heard during hunting forays are
also mentioned. During the breeding season a vibrating "cree-cree" is
uttered. The Maori name for the Morepork is Ruru.
Mathews and Iredale sub-divided the New Zealand population of
Moreporks into two subspecies; a light form from North Island being
identified as Ninox novaeseelandiae venatica and the darker birds from
South Island remained as the nominate form. However, more recently,
researchers (Fleming et al. 1953 and Oliver 1955 p 433) have stated that as
no constant and significant difference separates the North and South
Island populations, this sub-division is unwarranted.

The first success that I can trace is that of David Fleay who bred them in
his aviaries in Ballarat, Victoria in 1925. Mr. Fleay had five of these owls,
three males and two females, in the same aviary and one pair mated and
reared two chicks. Apparently no friction between the breeding pair and
the unmated birds occurred; indeed the latter are said to have assisted in the
rearing of the chicks. In 1934 the Melbourne Zoo recorded the rearing of
four young Boobook Owls in their collection and in 1941 this species was
bred at the Sir Colin Mackenzie Sanctuary, Healesville, Victoria, although
it is not stated if the chicks were reared to independence. Melbourne Zoo
reported a further three Boobook Owls reared in the collection in 1966
followed by two more in 1967.
In 1970 West Berlin Zoo imported two Boobook Owls from Australia
and these were housed in an outdoor aviary measuring 4x2 metres.
Their diet consisted of mice, sparrows and minced meat mixed with egg
yolk. In February 1972 these owls were observed displaying and eggs were
laid in mid-April. Between io-i5th of May two chicks were hatched and
these left the nest box on June 14th. One of these young owls was subse-
quently lost, but our member Prof. Dr. Heinz Georg Klos, the zoo's
Scientific Director, very kindly offered me the survivor. Although Boobook
Owls are not uncommon in the wild, they are rarely exhibited in European
collections, so I am extremely grateful to Prof. Klos for entrusting such
uncommon birds to a small private collection.
I received the initial Boobook Owl in early 1973, the transfer being
delayed for a long period while my application for an import licence was
being considered by the Home Office. This bird was installed in an indoor
flight cage 3 x 1.5 x .75 metres and I was immediately impressed by its
tame and confiding manner. It was fed on the standard diet that I provide
to all my medium sized owls i.e. day-old chicks and captive-bred mice. No
other food or supplements have ever been offered to the Boobook Owls.
In 1973 West Berlin Zoo were again successful in breeding a single
Boobook Owl and this bird was sent to me when independent. On the
arrival of the second bird I was fairly confident that I had got a true pair.
The new bird was far less phlegmatic than the original and over the last few
years I have noticed that female owls tend to be far more unsteady than the
males. The new bird was appreciably larger then the original, although, as
can be seen from the foregoing tables of comparative wing measurements,
this factor is by no means conclusive, and the shape of the head differed

markedly from that of the original bird. The head of the presumed male
was narrow, flat across the top and the feathering above the eyes formed
heavy brows which made the eyes appear recessed, whereas the other
bird's head was much broader, well rounded and lacked the heavy brows.
In fact the latter appeared to wear a permanent look of "wide-eyed
amazement".
The two birds settled down well together, but although a plywood nest
box .30 x .30 x .40 metre high was installed in early January, no attempt to
breed was made during 1974. the early part of March of the following
year the female's temperament changed dramatically. Her normally shy and
slightly nervous response when I entered the birdroom became one of
aggression. Whenever I approached the Boobook Owls' flight, the female
would crouch low on the perch, spread her wings and snap her beak
angrily. By the end of March the female spent most of each day in the
nest box, but in the evening she was usually with the male in the flight. In
early April she appeared to be permanently in the nest and I assumed
that she had laid, although as I am a firm believer in disturbing breeding
birds as little as possible, I did not open the box to confirm this.
As there was no evidence of any chicks having hatched, I opened the box
on May 10th, as I assumed that the eggs were infertile and should be
removed; however, I found that the two eggs were fertile and close to the
point of hatching. The eggs looked uniform in size, were well rounded and
the one that I removed for examination measured 41 x 36 mm. Like all
owl eggs that I have examined, they were off-white in colour.
On the evening of May 14th a chick was calling when I serviced the
owls' cage and by the rather weak volume of this call I assumed that the
chick was only a few hours old. As Boobook Owls are said to incubate for
30-31 days, it is evident that the female sat for several days prior to laying
the first egg. Two days later two chicks were heard calling simultaneously,
one call being much stronger than the other.
The rearing of the chicks progressed uneventfully: the female brooded
them very closely and although the male always appeared aloof and rather
disinterested in his family when I was in the birdroom, by looking through
a window I could see that he quickly took the day-old chicks and mice that I
left and offered them to the female. By the time the young ones were three
weeks old, they were frequently seen looking out of the nest, although the
female immediately ushered them to the back of the box when she realised
that I was present. The chicks left the nest when they were five weeks old,
although they frequently returned to it if startled. At this stage they were
much smaller than the adults and they were predominantly downy in
appearance; however both could fly strongly from the first day that they
left the nest.
I separated the chicks from their parents in early August, by which time
it was difficult to distinguish them from the adults.

Bubo b. bengalensis
By Kim Simmons (Linton Zoo, Cambridge)
The Bengal Eagle Owl is a small, pale coloured form found in India from
Kashmir through the lower Himalayas to Assam, south to Sind, the
Nilgiris, the region south of Madras and Arakan. It is generally accepted to
be one of the many subspecies of Bubo bubo , although some authorities
argue that in spite of the fact that this race is possibly sympatric with
other races of Bubo bubo , no evidence of intergradation exists, which
might suggest that the status of a full species is warranted.
Our first Bengal Eagle Owl was purchased in 1972, but as this bird's
arrival coincided with a programme of extensive rebuilding and land-
scaping activities within the zoo, no immediate attempt to locate a second
bird was made. However, quite by chance a second was offered to us in
June 1973 and although the sex of both birds was uncertain, this offer was
accepted, the new owl was installed in the aviary already occupied by the
original specimen and it settled in comparatively quickly.
The aviary was not particularly elaborate, consisting of 2 inch wire-
netting stretched over a rustic framework and it measured 20 feet x 16 feet x
6 feet. high. In fact this structure was only provided as temporary accom-
modation until a more permanent, planted enclosure could be erected.
Although a number of branches and logs were provided for perching, both
birds seemed to prefer to spend most of their time on the ground amongst
the thick undergrowth. The public are only admitted to the front of this
aviary, as one side is bounded by a large paddock the other side is protected
by another aviary housing Tawny Owls Strix aluco . The aviary backs on to
an overgrown hillock created from the spoil from an adjacent disused
chalk quarry.
The diet consists of day-old poultry chicks, young rabbits and guinea
pigs, adult mice and gerbils. Both birds show a marked preference for day-
old chicks and we feed every day apart from Sundays when all the birds of
prey fast for 24 hours. The birds' consumption varies, but 6-8 chicks are
provided for each bird and this seems to be in excess of their normal
requirement.
On September 20th. 1973 we noticed the more recently acquired owl

casually dusting itself in the far left-hand corner of the aviary, in a manner
of a chicken dust-bathing and on September 21st, whilst giving out the
food, I noticed that the dusting area had a neatly prepared concave scooped
out. It was only at this stage that we thought that the owls were in fact a
true pair and that they were preparing to nest, so from that time we kept a
close watch on the activities. When the aviary was approached, the suppos-
ed female would crouch low into the nesting hollow, while the other bird
would show obvious signs of agitation by turning the head from side to
side and snapping its beak.
On October 14th 1973 the female laid the first egg and commenced
incubation. The nest, which consisted simply of a hollow in the earth, was
situated completely in the open, but yet the female persistently incubated
through a variety of weathers while the male stood alongside, warning of
the approach of any intruders.
The incubation period for most eagle owls is 35 days, so five weeks after
the first egg was laid we maintained careful observation. On November 19th
I noticed that the day-old chicks had been arranged around the nesting
hollow, so we increased the amount of food. On the evening of November
26th. I crept along the side of the paddock to observe the female. She was
sitting very tightly but the head of a chick was clearly visible poking out
from under her wing, then as she turned to one side, the downy body of
another chick was visible. At this stage the chicks were covered with yellow-
ish-grey down and the eyes were still closed.
On December 7th four chicks were observed: then on December 8th we
experienced a torrential rain storm during the night and the nest was
flooded. In spite of this the female continued devotedly to brood the
chicks, although it seemed unlikely that they could possibly survive under
such wet, muddy conditions. As a result, we decided that the only solution
was to hand-rear any survivors. When my father inspected the nest, he
found it part full of muddy water and one of the chicks already dead, but
the remaining three, although cold and wet, were still alive. I rushed them
to our kitchen where we had already prepared a box with a lining of hay and
towelling. We then placed them in their makeshift nest alongside the
cooker to warm and dry them. When they were warm and thoroughly dry
we removed them to a quiet corner of the kitchen and covered them over
with a cotton sheet. They were then left undisturbed for about four hours.
Initially it was difficult to get the young owls to feed and it proved
necessary to force feed them with pieces of day-old chick; however, they
soon gained confidence and called for food whenever anybody approached
their box. On their first day in the kitchen they consumed three chicks
between them. By this time their body size had almost trebled since I first
saw them; their eyes, which appeared greenish, were open and the down
seemed darker. The young owls were weighed regularly and a chart was
compiled giving details of their weight, food consumption, development and
response. The weight increase in ounces was as follows

At first the chicks were entirely dependent on us: they appeared to be
unable to stand, but could use their claws to grip. They seemed to respond
mainly to sounds, although their vision was obviously developing. The
food consumption increased daily and we encouraged them to be diurnal by
feeding them during the day. The first feed was at 7.30 am and the last
was at 12.30 am. The strength in their legs gradually increased until, on
December 18th, when they were still less than a month old, they had
sufficient balance to perch quite confidently on my knee.
By December 25th they were becoming more independent and were
attempting to tear up small pieces of the chicks. Their vision appeared
exceptionally good and their iris colour had turned to orange-brown. The
down-covered eyelids now had well developed eyelashes and one of the
chicks sported downy ear tufts that were held permanently erect.
By December 30th they had feathers on wings and tails, but the re-
mainder of the body was still clad in brown down. They spent much of
their time playing on the kitchen floor and would make clumsy attacks on
spiders and inseas after sitting and studying them for some time, although
they never seemed to retrieve their viaims. They also delighted in playing
with the seed from an avocado pear, in fact their behaviour rather reminded
one of a group of domestic kittens. The young owls were capable of flying
short distances by January 30th and were almost fully feathered. It was
then found necessary to transfer them to an aviary in an outbuilding. On
February 21st feathered ear tufts were discernible, although they were still ,
small and really only visible when the birds were alert. By February 28th.
they were fully feathered and closely resembled the adults, it was particu-
larly obvious that they were appreciably larger than their parents. On j
January 28th 1974 the mother was seen to be incubating two eggs and on
March 5th two more young ones were observed in the nest scrape: on
March 28th these left the nest. On December 5th the female was incubating
yet again and to date we have successfully reared twelve Bengal Eagle
Owls and all have been transferred to other zoos or private colleaions for
breeding purposes. Two of these birds, which were each mated to imported
specimens, themselves reared young in the aviaries of our members,
Philip Dugmore and Peter Smith, when they were only twelve months old.

By Y. A. Greichus, A. Greichus and D. J. Call
(South Dakota State University, Brookings, South Dakota)
Concern has developed in recent years regarding the effects of organo-
chlorine insecticide and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) residues upon the
biology of fish-eating birds. A study on the physiological effects of PCB's
or a combination of DDT, DDD and DDE in juvenile White Pelicans
Pelecanus erythrorhynchos was conducted at South Dakota State University
(SDSU) during the summer of 1972 (Greichus et al 1975). The present
article describes the care and feeding of these captive birds.
Pelican nestlings were collected on June 19th and July 7th, 1972 at
LaCreek National Wildlife Refuge, Bennett County, South Dakota. On
June 19th, the young at the rookery ranged in age from newly hatched to
approximately three weeks. On July 7th, the young ranged in age from
approximately two to six weeks. The birds collected were estimated to
average two and five weeks old, respectively, on the two collection dates
(Hall, personal communication).
The nestlings were transported to the Wildlife Research Area at SDSU,
and housed in cages which have been described in detail (DeLaRonde and
Greichus, 1972). Heat lamps were used for the first few days for added
warmth during the night. On July 15th, 27 pelicans for the experiment were
randomly placed into nine cages, three birds per cage. They were housed in
this manner until the end of the study in mid-October. The cages were
cleaned daily and fresh water was supplied to their swimming tanks as
needed.
The captive birds were fed black bullheads Ictalurus melas, carp Cyprinus
carpio , bigmouth buffalo Ictiobus cyprinellus and white suckers Catasomus
commersoni. The fish were supplied by a local commercial fishery and
frozen until needed. Some fish flesh is low in thiamine content (U.S.D.A.,
1963) and contains a thiaminase enzyme (Melnick et al . 3 1945; Cantarow
and Schepartz, 1962). Therefore, as a precautionary measure, a supple-
ment of B vitamins (A-H Robins Co., Richmond, Va.) was administered to
all birds starting on July 27th. This daily supplement contained 7.2 mg of
thiamine mononitrate. Chura and Stewart (1967) supplemented the fish
diet of captive Bald Eagles with multiple vitamins to prevent possible
vitamin deficiencies in these birds. Whole, not eviscerated, fish were fed to
the pelicans.
Early in the study it was noted that the skin of the young pelicans was
very pale. Consequently, blood was drawn from six birds and an average red
blood cell count of .76million/cu mm of whole blood, a haemoglobin of
3.5 gm per cent, and a haematocrit of 12.7 per cent was found. Three wild
nestling pelicans of the same age and from the same rookery had an average
red blood cell count of 1.98 million/cu mm, a haemoglobin of 7.9 gm per

cent, and a haematocrit of 26 per cent. To prevent further anaemia from
occurring, approximately 15 mg. of iron supplement was administered
orally daily in the form of ferrous sulfate (Mead Johnson Laboratories,
Evansville, Ind.) or ferrous gluconate (Winthrop Laboratories, New York,
N.Y.). After six weeks the treatments were stopped. The average red
blood cell count of the treated birds had increased to 3.04 million/cu mm.
The average haemoglobin and haematocrit values had also increased to
15.2 gm per cent and 43.3 per cent, respectively.
It has been observed by the authors that wild pelicans consume sala-
manders and frogs in addition to fish. This may account for their haemo-
globins being higher than in the penned birds.
Food regimens used in the pesticide study and subsequent growth
curves are shown in Figure 1. The pelican growth curves were similar to

those of captive Double-crested Cormorants (DeLaRonde and Greichus,
1972), Growth peaks for the pelicans occurred at five to six weeks while
cormorants attained maximum weights at six to seven weeks. When first
placed in the pens the birds were force-fed, but after a few days they readily
accepted the fish. The daily food intake of each pelican was 1,400 g. for
the first six weeks of captivity. After this time the birds did not consume
all the food that was offered and the daily food intake dropped to approxi-
mately 600 g. Consequently, the two per day feedings were reduced to one
per day. The average body weight of the male pelicans was higher than that
of the females throughout the study.
The fungal disease, aspergillosis, has been reported to be common in

young Double-crested Cormorants and White Pelicans (Bicknell et al. s
1971; DeLaRonde and Greichus, 1972; Greichus and Greichus, 1973).
Preventive measures against aspergillosis and secondary bacterial compli-
cations were taken by periodically fogging the birds with amphotericin B
(Squibb Co., New York, N.Y.) and Terramycin (Pfizer Co., New York,
N.Y) solution. The solution consisted of 0.1 mg/ml amphotericin B plus
1.2 mg/ml terramycin, and was sprayed as a fine mist into a sealed cage with
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.983164148148148" page_id="56381766"  page_num="141" year="" vol="">
an atomizer (Root-Lowell Corp., Lowell, Mich.). All birds received seven
30-minute treatments over a period of seven weeks. Two birds, observed to
emit rasping respiratory sounds, received an additional treatment. Upon
necropsy, Aspergillus fumigatus lesions and/or granulomas were observed in
the lungs and air sacs of three of the 27 pelicans.
Gular pouch haematomas were caused by heavy infestations of the
pouch louse Fiagetiella peralis. These haematomas gradually disappeared
from all birds after the lice were removed with forceps and the infected
areas disinfected with 80 per cent ethanol. Two species of intestinal round-
worms, Contracaecum spiculigerum and Skrjahinocara squamatum , were
identified from these pelicans and from Double-crested Cormorants in an
earlier study (Greichus et al. } 1974). Two birds that died before the start of
the experiment were heavily infested with roundworms. All birds were
treated for roundworms with 100 mg/kg body weight with piperazine
worming medicine (Miller Chemical Co., Omaha, Neb.). This represented
the dosage recommended for turkeys. Roundworms were present in the
captive pelicans at the end of the experiment.
The removal of the ectoparasites from the birds was necessary for another
aspect of this project (Greichus et al. , 1974). This necessitated washing the
birds in a mild detergent solution. To perform this the birds were sedated
prior to immersion in the detergent bath. Several compounds were tested
for their sedative qualities including Thorazine (chlorpromazine) and
Vetame, a derivative of phenothiazine. No pronounced sedative effects were
observed after administration of these drugs. Ketamine hydrochloride
(Parke-Davis Co., Detroit, Mich.) at a dosage of seven mg/kg was found
to be a very effective sedative. Following an intramuscular injection in the
thigh they could be readily handled and washed about 10 minutes later.

After the washing process was completed the birds were dried and placed
under heat lamps to recover, as body temperatures were lowered during
anaesthesia. Recovery to a standing position required about 40 minutes,
and to a state of normal co-ordination and mobility in about two hours.
Some regurgitation and loss of appetite occurred, but normal appetite was
restored within one day.
Two birds developed relatively deep flesh wounds during the study.
The wounds were sprayed with an antiseptic and each bird received an
intramuscular injection of two ml of an aqueous suspension of penicillin
and dihydrostreptomycin (Pfizer Co., New York, N.Y.). Both wounds
healed cleanly and the birds exhibited no ill effects from the treatments.
Superficial wounds were treated with methylene blue or iodine sprays.
In one case, treatment for foot swelling was initiated. The swelling was
found to be the staphylococcus-caused chronic suppurative pododermatitis,
or "bumblefoot." The infected bird was isolated in a carpeted cage and
treated with two weekly 0.05 per cent copper sulfate foot baths (Meinecke,
personal communication). The swelling diminished and the bird was later
returned to its original cage.

The Hawk-headed Parrot Deroptyus accipitrinus
The Hawk-headed Parrot was formerly very scarce in British collections
(Greene 1883-875 Prestwich 19685 Low 1972). Perhaps they are less un-
common at present: I can think of 35 individuals during the past five
years. Some of these have since died and, as I could not have possibly
known all the birds, the present U.K. population might be somewhere
around 25.1 strongly doubt it to be higher than 30, of which only three are
English-bred and most of which were imported by Mr M. Clifford of West
Bromwich as nestlings in 197O5 71, 72. Very few have arrived since these
dates although I obtained a further pair, from Brazil, in March 1976.
Description
Good illustrations are so readily available (see references) that it may
suffice to say that the Hawkhead is physically about as large as a Rock
Pigeon Columba livia and the shape of the tail approximates to that of the
Wood Pigeon C. palumbus, reminding me, as they did Miss Low (1972), of
Pyrrhura conures.The back, wings and tail are holly-green; the head brown
with a lighter, greyish front and the brown feathers of the cheeks are
lightly shaft-streaked. The bill, skin around the eye and feet are dull black
and the outer rim of the iris dirty yellow. By far the most distinctive
feature is the broad blue edge to the maroon feathers of the chest, belly and
neck. Like the similarly coloured feathers of the Vinaceous Amazon
Parrot Amazona vinacea, those of the occiput are raised when the birds are
frightened, or when they are threatening others, and form a wide halo.
Despite the thick blue edging of these maroon-coloured feathers being so
particularly obvious, the bird recently has sometimes been pathetically
called the Red-fan Parrot. Is the fan of this whimsy the ruff of occipital
feathers? The three healthy birds weighed were two females at 265 and
260 grams and a male at 260 grams.
Sexual differences
I have carefully examined eight individuals of KNOWN sex, including
four dead ones, and it is my opinion that it is quite impossible to determine
the gender of a Hawkhead by its colour, but the size of the head and bill
might be some guide. Behavioural differences are seen; males are more
aggressive and more vociferous, but I would not like to hazard a guess
without directly comparing the behaviour of an unknown with known
sexed birds.
Hawkheads are very variable in colouring: the edging to the maroon

feathers can be any shade between cerulean, dull grey-blue or, in some
cases about the neck, green. The outer ring of the iris varies from almost
white to a dirty yellow, although the inner ring is invariably a slate grey.
The whiteness to the front of the head might increase with maturity: I have
not found that this, nor the proportion of red in the lateral tail feathers is
related to the sex of the bird.

Had they the choice, I am certain that my Hawkheads would live almost
entirely on fruit and bread soaked in milk. Seeds that are eaten include
peanuts, pine nuts, sunflower, hemp and canary seed. From August until
they become unavailable in December, or January, these parrots delight in
the fruits of the hawthorn Crataegus monogyna. Despite their partiality
for other fruits, the flesh of the haw is discarded as they quickly extract the
stone. This stone is extremely hard and very small and to stop it rotating in
the beak, the Hawkheads usually have to press the stone against an aviary
wire or against the edge of an uplifted toe. The favourite green foods are
dandelion seed heads and peas in the pod; otherwise they ignore most green
food.
Voice
With the exception of the cooing of pigeons I find it quite impossible to
convert the sounds that birds are said to make into the noises that they
actually produce. Yet, as the Hawkhead is so noisy, it is impossible to
describe the bird without making some attempt. There are very noticeable
dialects between different Hawkheads but after some months of contact they
come to sound the same. The voice does not have the horrible grating
harshness of many South American parrots: it is extremely powerful and I
can hear it half a mile away; fortunately distant neighbours, who might also
hear it over this range, might not identify it as coming from parrots.
Shortly after dawn, as I lie in bed, I always hear the contact call from the
other side of the house. It is a ringing yak yak yak . . . and after several
repeats, it usually finishes with a more piping, still powerful, wa wa wa ...
weo. So difficult is it to interpret sounds into words that to McLoughlin
(1976) the phrase is tak-heeya-heeya and, in truth, from a distance it might
sound something like this. When they are frightened, the laughing, slightly
maniacal quality of the contact call changes to the shriller and faster
produced disyllabic alarm and flocking call of eea eea. In extreme panic
they squawk, but pairs communicate between each other, especially when
they are feeding, with a very low yak yak.
Following a fight between two hens, the beaten one was heard plaintively
uttering a most pathetic sounding eeezsz sign of her submission. Threat-
ening males growl and both sexes will hiss as they flick the head in anger
or intimidation.

General behaviour
They frequently walk on the ground and if disturbed they do not fly
upwards as most terrestrial parrots would do: I therefore assume that they
are primarily arboreal. The similar size and shape to the body and tail
does suggest that they might share the same preferred habitat as the
Australian King Parrot Alisterus scapularis.
When I first had my two back from the Granthams, who had looked
after them for two years or so, they were essentially wild, panicking and
overwhelming me with their incredibly loud noises whenever I approached
their aviary. I think that it was the nervous tension that caused one of
the two hens to strip herself of feathers. In three days she was almost bald
and, very reluctantly (because of the din) I took her into the house. She
never plucked another feather and soon became perfectly tame. When her
feathers had part regrown she was restored to her companion where she
soon taught it to become equally confiding. Almost a year later I found her
with a bloody wound on her back: as she was very much the boss, her
injury must have been self-administered. She was brought into the house
and carefully examined for parasites, using first a bag containing chloro-
form around the body--as is done to collect parasites in the wild--and then
by dusting with pyrethrum, but none were found. After ten days inside the
house, which she enjoyed because of the continual flow of tit-bits, she seem-
ed as good as new. Alas on the very morning that I was to have put her
outside she was found dead of a haemorrhage where she had severely muti-
ated her own back. She was a huge personality, being completely without
fear, and despite extensive search I still remain puzzled as to what gave
her that mortal itch.
Hawkheads are very observant; nothing that moves escapes their eye.
The black skin around the eye is bare and as the eye bulges slightly from its
orbit it gives a Hawkhead an uninterrupted field of view. It is probable that,
like the similar "pop-eyed" rabbit, it can see backward, upward, downward,
sideward and forward with the head held in the normal upright position.
A threatening Hawkhead is so very attractive a spectacle that it would be
nice if one could summon up this display at will when showing people
around the aviaries, but as the most spectacular show is only done when the
Hawkhead itself is somewhat frightened, it is difficult to get tame birds to
oblige unless one can show them a strange bird, as by holding a caged bird
up to the wire. The wild garden birds are frequently threatened when they
settle on, or near to, the aviary. As far as I have yet seen, the wild birds take
not a bit of notice and it is ludicrous to see a tiny Blue or Cole Tit uncon-
cernedly stealing food and seeds from inside the aviary whilst a relatively
huge Hawkhead looms only an inch or two away threat displaying. The
curiosity is that while the garden birds do not care, those South American
parrots I have tried, including two very tame Spectacled Amazon Parrots
Amazona albifrons are greatly impressed by what is, after all, so much bluff,
and frantically try to get away.

When the Hawkhead is rather nervous, the nape feathers rise and the
head resembles a Red Indian chief in his head-dress of eagle feathers. If
really excited, the body feathers are sleeked, the tail is wide-spread and the
wings held away from the body as the bird writhes a little, blazes the eyes
and suddenly starts and hisses at the same time. In all essentials this threat
is the same as that of frightened Sun Conures Aratinga solstitialis (in a
cage), caiques Pionites , Amazon parrots or those other New World parrots
known to me.
The male threatens me as he does known rival Hawkheads. He lowers
the head and raises the feathers of the chin, cheek and body slightly but not
the ruff, and the head is raised and lowered once or twice. The wings are
held off the body not quite fully extended, somewhat in the position of the
wings of a stooping falcon. The wing nearer to me is usually held further
from the body, in which case, by moving my position, I can get the male to
extend first one wing and then the other while his eyes fairly blaze. Such a
display is eerily silent, although he sometimes growls a kwow kzvozv.
He steadily walks towards me in the very purposeful and absolutely charac-
teristic way of threatening American parrots, with the head so low that the
bill only just skims the surface of the perch. Or he may twist the head to
one side and advance with one eye pointing skywards and the other to the
earth and yet, because of wide field of vision, still looking straight at me.
After one of his slow charges the male usually walks back along his perch to
re-position himself for a repeat. When he walks back it is strange to some-
times see him looking back at me even though his head is facing the direc-
tion in which he is moving. During the threatening walk up and especially
if he is none too certain of himself, he stops occasionally, sleeks his plumage
tight and flicks his head. This sudden flicking, interrupting the very slow
pace of the walk, is strangely startling even when it is expected. As he
reaches the wire separating us, he takes hold of a strand and bites it in such
a way that his lower jaw keeps slipping from the wire to make a popping
sound. Hardy (1963) took "beak popping" to be part of the courtship display
of the Orange-fronted Conure A. canicular is. With the greatest of respect I
feel that he may have been mistaken. I believe "popping" to be an antagon-
sitic gesture: a rattling of arms, for male Black-headed Caiques P.
melanocephala , when thwarted by the wires of the cage from directly i
attacking a rival, similarly beak-pop on the wire or may do this from the
top of vertical twigs. In both Hawkheads and Caiques the popping is seem-
ingly directed not to the female but always towards the rival. From the
description and circumstance of Hardy's colonies, I think that this might
have applied for his Orange-fronted Conures.
Breeding
Initially I had two hens; the one that killed herself often spent long
periods chewing away at the inside of her nest box. Twice she so heavily
persecuted the second hen that I had to take her away for several days. The

second bird, because of her quiet demeanour, was correctly taken to be a
female. Males might well be, as male caiques certainly are, the more noisy
sex. It was especially kind of Peter Paris to lend me a Hawkhead in March
1974. After worming, this was directly put with the other (not without
some qualms). After an hour or two of careful and mutual reconnoitreing
and head flicking they began preening each other. In April and early May I
heard them pairing several times a day. (Like Bronze-winged Parrots
Pionus chalcopterus during the whole protracted sequence of treading, both
sexes growl a quite harsh kaaaa .... A noise distinctive and loud enough to
attract attention from myself, the first time that I heard it, from fifty
yards off). The active bird, for sometimes the female may take the male
role, and in this case both were hens, raising and lowering its head yet only
putting one foot on the back of the other bird, the other foot retaining its
grip on the perch.
The first egg, of a three egg clutch, was laid on May 15th 1974. The first
few days of incubation were desultory but after that she sat well, but came
off the nest several times a day to feed. I never once saw the other bird feed
the incubating hen, which confirmed my suspicions about its sex. By May
25th the borrowed Hawkhead proved my guess as to its correct sex, for it
began to share the brooding and on June 2nd I removed the infertile eggs.
Egg measurements were: 35.5 x 26, 34 x 26 and 33.2 x 26.8 mm.; average
weight 13.8 grams when the air space was filled with water.
On August 20th she began her second clutch, this time of two eggs.
Four days following these the second hen laid her first egg of a clutch of
three. Eggs are laid at 2\ or 3 day intervals.
Peter Paris kindly sent me a male and the first borrowed bird was paired
up in the next aviary with a two year-old English-bred bird (by Mrs
Howard) lent to me by the Granthams. The Grantham bird also proved to
be female and would flirt with the male through the separating wires and
angrily display at his wife: she also spent long periods chewing away inside
her nest box.
The pair laid on February 5th 1975 a clutch of three which failed to
hatch with "dead-in-shell", a common failing with winter-laid eggs. The
second nest of that year was another clutch of three begun on October 4th:
these eggs were smashed by the birds, through no fault of their own, and
the nest box was rebuilt to make it smaller and more cosy. Pairs of Hawk-
heads use the nest as a dormitory throughout the year and nest chewing is
performed by both sexes, but usually only one bird works away at a time.
In 1976 the first egg (of a clutch of four) appeared on March 21st. It was
dangerous examining the nest, for the male was fearless and ferocious; if
the hen was out of the box then the two would attack together. The only
defence against such angry birds (my fear is of inadvertently injuring them
in self-defence,) is to show them a catching net, but in the case of Hawk-
heads this was a frail defence, for the cock would wrench this out of my
hand while my attention was being given to the box; and a Hawkhead

rapidly pulling tuft after tuft of hair from my head always made me
escape as fast as I could.
During the incubation I whistled to the male (something I'd not done
before) and he immediately whistled back and now continues to do this
imitation whenever he gets close to me. This is the only "foreign" noise
in his repertoire.
On April 16th, using someone to divert the birds' attention, I managed
to get a prolonged look into the box. Unfortunately this aviary is exception-
al because I have to get inside with the birds to see into the nest. To my
surprise I found that a definite nest, that is a shaped cup made of strips of
wood arranged with the long axis of each around the circumference, had
been made to contain the clutch. The eggs started to hatch after 26 days
of incubation. The chicks soon disappeared and the part-mutilated chick
that I rescued from a pipping egg died despite my attempt to hand-rear it.
The next clutch, this time of three eggs, was started on May 20th. Again
after 26 days of incubation the eggs began to hatch. Because the first chick
was missing on the second day, I took away the pipping egg and the other
fertile egg was dented removing it. The chick which hatched I successfully
hand-reared in that it has no 'hunger-traces' in the feathers, but by October
20th, that is at 18 weeks old, it still will not eat for itself. Not that it could
not: for weeks now it has been able to crack open pine nuts, sunflower seeds
and apple pips, yet it discards the kernels. I take it that this 'laziness' is a
combination of a lack of parental example and my inability to "starve it into
better ways". The parents are nesting again: the first egg was laid on
September 29th and, because it will soon be winter, I shall take the eggs
away and see if I can hand-rear these chicks.
One live chick from thirteen fertile eggs demonstrates the inefficiency of
my Hawkhead breeding and why I have now decided to hand-rear the
next few clutches.
From the widespread dates of laying--February, March, April, May, 1
August and September it may be that Hawkheads, like many tropical
parrots, are able to breed at any time of the year.
General observations
McLoughlin &amp; Burton (1976) raise the question as to how the Hawkhead 1
relates to other American parrots. The more my acquaintance with the
parrots of this continent the less I believe that there are any great differ- 1
ences between the several genera: they differ in size, colour, length of tail 1
but share, or overlap, in their general behaviour. Nevertheless I feel that the
Hawkhead has far more behavioural similarity to the 'conures' and
caiques than, say, the Amazon parrots.
The chick of the Hawkhead is like that of other American parrots. It has
a sealed earhole for the first weeks of life. The down is thin, white and
rather long and the upper mandible has a huge bulbous swelling at either i
side which finally disappears some months after weaning. The lower bill is

shorter than the upper one when adult but in the juvenile it is wider and
longer with thickened rims. This huge "sugar scoop" makes hand-rearing
so easy because the food can be almost poured directly into the mouth. The
toes are zygodactyl on hatching and the very young chick moves about on
all four limbs. Indeed it has to, for the legs are so very tiny and the wings
much larger and better developed.
spix's macaw Cyanopsitta spixii
Digression
It is rather unusual for any bird to be coloured almost entirely blue;
however it is well known in parrots for a simple mutation to arise that pre-
vents the bird being able to synthesise yellow and red pigments, and this
mutation converts what would otherwise have been a green parrot into a
blue one. Blue mutations have been found in more than 30 species-- in-
cluding the Budgerigar, the Indian Ringneck, the Blue and Yellow Macaw
and the curious case of the Kakapo Strigops habroptilus.
However there are eight, or possibly nine, species of naturally blue
parrots. The three that occur in the Old World may well have been founded
upon such a simple blue mutation: the Ultramarine Vini ultramarina and
Tahitian Lory V. peruviana on first occupying their isolated islands were
probably green like the, say. Blue-crowned Lory V. australis of the next
island group; yet at some point a recessive blue mutation arose and, be-
cause of the inevitable high degree of inbreeding of small island forms, soon
produced blue examples. The strangeness is why the blue form was at a
selective advantage compared with the, originally, more numerous green
(?) examples. Whatever the advantage of the blue over the green, it also
seems to have applied on Rodrigues, in the Indian Ocean, where Newton&apos;s
Farrakeet Fsittacula exsul seems very much like a blue mutation of the
Ring-necked Farrakeet P. krameri.
The five blue parrots of the New World, being larger in size and main-
land species in direct competition with other species of parrot, do not seem
to be simple blue mutations. For the Hyacinthine Anodorhynchus hyacin-
thinus , Glaucous A. glauca and Lear&apos;s Macaw A. learii have yellow skin on
the face, near to the beak and around the eyes, that it seems they can still
produce yellow pigments. The Blue and Yellow Macaw and the Caninde
Macaw A. canindae (a most dubious species) have a yellow chest and belly:
the blue mutation of the Blue and Yellow Macaw is white in these areas.
Spix&apos;s Macaw has no yellow colour, save in the iris; but I have read some-
where in a back copy of the avicultural magazine that immature
Spix&apos;s are speckled with green feathers.
Spix&apos;s Macaw is very rare nowadays in captivity. My own bird came
from Portugal in February and has long been a captive. Apart from her (?),
I know of a pair in Naples Zoo, one of which has laid eggs; the other bird
was the property of Mr Alfredo Marques. It is said that President Tito of

Yugoslavia also has a pair. Unfortunately my bird was once tethered by its
leg and the resulting fracture, from such a wicked practice, has left it a
cripple. It shuffles along, using both legs and can hold food freely in a foot
to eat. As my chances of obtaining another are nil I shall try to hybridise it
with another species of small macaw.
Description
Spix's Macaw in body is about as large as a Hawk-headed Parrot. I
have not weighed it but would guess it to be not more than 200 grams. The
wings are very long and seem too large for the body; the tail is also very
long. The overall colour is greyish-blue with a more bluish head and blue
wings and tail. The bill, facial skin, feet and legs are black. The bill is not
very large for a macaw, nor is the voice, for, although an extremely noisy
bird, it does not produce harsh screams but crow-like caa caas and its
contact call is an ugh ugh squah squah , which latter it does incessantly, blaz-
ing its eyes with each squah.

By Robin L. Restall (Caracas, Venezuela)
The genus Tiaris is well known in aviculture, thanks to two species. These
are the Cuban Finch T. canora and the Olive Finch T. olivacea. Of these,
the Cuban Finch is mainly a bird of memory and although it is well served
in the literature, virtually the only source of supply of the species since the
coming to power of Fidel Castro in Cuba during 1959 has been aviary-bred
birds. It is the most colourful member of the genus, is comparatively easy
to breed in confinement and was always in demand. In contrast, the Olive
Finch appeared to be the dull cousin: dealers frequently advertised it as the
Cuban Olive Finch, presumably in an effort to stimulate a demand among a
clientele that was well read, but not too well read. This species never
attracted the attention of the fancy very much and is consequently poorly
served in the literature.
There are several other species of Tiaris distributed in what might be
called broadly the Caribbean area, but the attention given to them by
avicultural writers seems to be in direct relation to their colourfulness.
Following this criterion, one would therefore expect the Black-faced
Grassquit to be very poorly dealt with indeed, since it is one of the dullest of
the genus, and this is, in fact, the case. My library is not the greatest in the
world, neither is my memory, but I can find only two references to the
species ever. The first of these is in aviculture where it is mentioned by A.
Decoux. I would like to repeat what that eminent French aviculturist wrote
in full:-
"The last example of this genus--the Dusky Finch (Phonipara bicolor )--
differs from the others by the absence of the black on the mask and
throat. It is found in the Antilles, Venezuela and Colombia. There is a
sub-species found in Jamaica, but many writers refuse to differentiate
them from the type. This last is less handsome than the Cuba or Olive
Finch; in an aviary their behaviour is the same."
The characteristic specifically mentioned by Decoux as distinguishing the
species from the others makes one wonder whether the bird(s) that he had
were either all females or examples of another Tiaris. In fact, the only male
Tiaris which would fit his description is T. obscura . The only other mentions
in the literature are my own (1968, 1975). Since coming to live in
Venezuela in 1974,I have had a fair amount of experience with the Black-
faced Grassquit and the following notes are an effort to put an adequate
comment on record for the benefit of any aviculturist fortunate to add the
species to his collection.

Distribution and nomenclature
According to James Bond (1968), there are seven races of the species
recognised; however, the only one which is widely distributed is T.b.
omissa. This race has a range extending from Florida, where it is a rare
vagrant, through the Bahamas and the Antilles to northern South America
where is occurs in northern Venezuela and northern Colombia. The other
races, assuming that they are still recognized as valid, are found each on
outlying small islands, ( e.g. T.b. tortugensis is restricted to the Venezuelan
offshore island of La Tortuga).
Black-faced Grassquit is a perfectly satisfactory and adequate name, but
Bond records the Bahama Black-faced Grassquit T.b. bicolor (1968) and the
following for the West Indies (1974):- Parson Bird, Parson Sparrow, Sin

travelling to the islands that local bird names, especially for the less
distinguishable birds, are usually non-specific and may be applied more or
less indiscriminately by the local populace. An example of this in Venezuela
is that the names given to T. bicolor are also used equally for the Blue-black
Grassquit Volatinia jacarini.
Habitat
It is naturally a bird of grassy scrub, but seems to be particularly fond of
areas surrounding human settlements. The mixed growth of grass, weeds
and shrubby open woodland and scrub that surrounds most human
habitation in this part of the world suits this grassquit very well, and it is a
common bird along roadsides and in gardens. Whenever well-wishing bird
lovers establish regular feeding stations in their gardens, it quickly be-
comes the commonest bird in the vicinity apparently adapting (reducing)
its territorial requirement to accommodate the food supply.
For several months from Easter 1975 onwards, then again for one month
over Easter 1976, I systematically caught and ringed this bird in my
garden. I estimated the local population at any given time to be around 25
birds in an area half the size of a football pitch (in the middle of which was
a large apartment block). Birds of the year wander a great deal (unless
stabilised by a bird feeder) showing a distinct preference for grassy areas.
Description (T.b. omissa)
Length 4.5. inches (10.8 cm.). Adult male: front of head, sides of neck,
underparts from chin to flanks and belly jet black; ventral region greyish-
olive; under tail-coverts black, edged cream; all upperparts olive green.

There is no sheen or gloss to the plumage at all. The bill is black, irides
sepia, legs and feet flesh coloured. Adult female: Entire upperparts dull
olive green, usually slightly browner above but may be slightly more
greyish than in the male; face and breast paler greyish-olive; remaining
underparts paler, fading to buff&quot; on under tail-coverts. Juvenile birds
resemble the female closely, but tend to be paler, slightly browner above
and greyer below. The easiest way to separate immatures from adult females
in my experience is by the condition of the plumage, for the old birds
invariably show signs of wear, usually the tips of the tertiaries, the upper
tail-coverts and around the lores.
At about three months, young males begin to show black feathering
about the face and my illustration shows a typical male at about six months.
The bill of both adult females and immatures is variable from horn to
dark horn, blackish on the upper mandible, especially the culmen, and on
the tip of the lower mandible. Bill colour cannot be relied upon as a sexing
diagnostic, but in adult females it tends to be darker; also with young males
showing black feathering. Very young birds invariably have the bill horn-
coloured.
Nesting
Breeding in the Bahamas "begins in March and continues well into the
summer". In Tobago, it seems to occur "from August to November and
January". In Caracas and along the littoral of northern Venezuela, terri-
torial activities and singing begin in earnest in March. By April most breed-
ing territories are established and breeding begins in May. The height of
the breeding season seems to be October-November, falling off rapidly in
December. The males are not singing from December through to February.
I once saw an immature being fed by an adult in April.
The nests that I have found have been oval in shape, about 8 to 10 inches
long, with the entrance at one end forming a 3-inch long funnel; the height
was about 6 inches. The outer structure has invariably been composed of
straws and heavy coarse grass, with a few weed stalks: the inner chamber was
lined with finer grasses. Bond (1968) records nests up to 20 feet above the
ground, and ffrench mentions up to 45 feet high. Normally, however, the
nest is placed in the centre of a bush just a few feet above the ground.
Bond (1968) gives the clutch size from 2 to 5, with sets of 3 or 4 being
most common. He gives the clutch size of 7 *. olivacea as "usually 3", and
T. canora as 2 to 3 in his guide to West Indian birds (1974), but does not
give a clutch size for T. bicolor: ffrench gives 2 or 3.
The few nests with eggs or young that I have found have had three. The
eggs are whitish, speckled with brown, more heavily marked at the thick
end. I do not have a record of incubation time, nor an accurate time for the
nestling period. Tropical finches are notoriously precocious, however, and
undoubtedly fledge in a shorter period than their European equivalents.
One brood of T. bicolor that I studied fledged in 11 days; another was

disturbed by me and the nestlings left the nest, to survive, when they were
probably 9 days.
Both sexes co-operate in the entire breeding cycle, building the nest,
brooding and feeding the young.
Voice
The new fledgling utters a sibilant "zeet", very fine and difficult to locate.
The adult, when aware of a danger to the fledglings, such as a cat or a
clumsy bird watcher, will keep up a regular and persistent buzzing " bzit "
during which time the fledglings remain utterly still and totally silent. In
the absence of the parents' warning note, the fledgling will continue to call
even though the intruder is present, unless unsettled by its close proximity,
in my case about 4 feet. The call note is a weak &quot;tsit". The song is variously
described as " tik-seeee , tik-tik-zeeee" or " dik-zee zee zee". To get a better
idea of the timing of these syllables, I prefer to write it as "dit, di-diddle
didee-didee". The Caracas birds at least do not buzz their song but whistle
it, and I am not alone in being able to do a passable imitation.
Young males frequently utter a contracted version of the song, more of a
"dit, didee" or the "tik-zee ee" of Bond. This shorter song is more warning-
like in its function and may be uttered by males of all ages when approach-
ing a truce territory such as a bird table. The full sweet song is normally
uttered by a male advertising territorial rights.
When chasing away an intruder at full intensity, the song is repeated
rapidly and acquires a more buzz-like quality; however, when a resident
male is approaching a visitor with some uncertainty the song is clear, sweet
and complete.
Behaviour
Black-faced Grassquits are somewhat gregarious, although the only flocks
that I have seen have been few, small, and of immatures. They may usually
be seen in pairs during most of the year. The flight is normally short and
direct. During the breeding season, the male will exhibit variations on a
display flight. In territorial display it will fly slowly with shallow wing-
beats, wings fully extended and fluttering rapidly; the plumage will be
slightly puffed, head down, tail fanned and held slightly down, the bird
singing repeatedly. When confronted with the female of the pair the male
will alight on a branch above its mate, and pursue it. Occasionally this
develops into a chase but, as often as not, the male's attention may be liken-
ed to that of a male pigeon. On occasion, I have seen a parachute-like
descent by the male ending with it landing almost on top of the female and
attempting to copulate immediately.
When confronted with an encroaching male from an adjoining territory,
the display posture changes in emphasis. The head is directed straight at
the opponent, or slightly raised; the bill is wide open, displaying a bright
reddish-pink interior; the plumage is puffed more and the tail raised. The

full ritualized treatment is given to known neighbours; a low intensity
version may be accorded to visiting females. Wandering young males are
given short shrift and are seen off by a direct frontal assault accompanied
by some song, but rarely full display.
I once watched a female Large-billed Seedfinch Oryziborus angolensis
feeding on the lawn in front of the building when a male T. bicolor flew
down upon it in the fluttering parachute descent. It sang at high intensity
upon landing, then chased the other bird away. This is the only time that I
have ever seen aggression to another species.
Food
Like other Tiaris species and most neo-tropical finches, this little
bunting is primarily a seed-eater and when the grasses are in ripe seeding
condition, there is no doubt that they form a major part of the diet. Black-
faced Grassquits will climb up seeding grass stalks, pull another stalk
within reach and hold it with the foot while the seed is eaten: they also feed
a lot on the ground. However, it would be a mistake to regard these birds as
being as dependent on seeds as most Sporophila species. I have often seen
them working across the scrubby hillside only yards from my bedroom
window, searching diligently beneath leaves, apparently for insects.
Whilst I am sure that they do feed newly-hatched chicks with some insect
food, there is no doubt that nestlings are given large quantities of vegetable
matter. These grassquits will readily come to cut oranges that are placed
out on a bird feeder, but will rarely sample banana. The day before writing
this article I saw a pair feeding in a Cuji tree, Calliandra sp. The male
deliberately and carefully ate the centre parts of a flower; the female bit off*
a whole small leaf and, just like any saltator, ate all of it.
Treatment in aviculture
During the past two years, I have kept about 30 individual Black-faced
Grassquits in cages for observations on diet preferences, behaviour, and for
painting. It is certain that, as a species, this bird is a typical Tiaris which
adapts very quickly and satisfactorily to conditions normally found in
aviculture. I have kept individual birds in very small cages and groups of
birds in medium and large cages. I have controlled their diet to the strictest
regimens and given them wide varieties: in every case, they have responded
well. Towards the end of the breeding season, they have shown a preference
for plain canary seed but, just before the start of the breeding season, I
found a marginal preference for small millets. On balance, I would recom-
mend a mixture of 50 per cent traditional European canary mixture with
50 per cent mixed millets. Lettuce and orange are both appreciated very
much, as is fresh seeding grass and seeding weeds; however, other fruits
are not readily taken and I have never had a bird who would even sample
soft food. Observations on bird feeders, however, have shown that they will
readily eat broken rice and will sample bread and milk. Black-faced

Grassquits enjoy bathing and should be given a bowl of fresh water every
day for this purpose.
I have placed freshly caught, fully adult males in individual cages in the
birdroom and on the wall on the outside of the building. These birds have
resumed singing and challenging other males that they hear within a day.
On a couple of occasions, individual males have sung within a matter of
hours. In contrast, when these birds have been placed in the large flight
cage with other members of their own species, or in a mixed collection,
they appear to be simply members of the group and the odd male who has
been singing has done so only after a few weeks of settling down, and then
sung only sporadically.
I have never seen any aggression by any individual under any circum-
stances in my cages, but I have no doubt that, were a pair breeding, or in
facilities suitable for breeding and they begin a breeding cycle, the male
would definitely be aggressive towards other male Tiaris. I can only sup-
pose, and this is hunch rather than knowledge, that the aggressiveness of a
male T. bicolor when breeding in confinement would be more like that of
T. olivacea than T. canora, which is at times exceptionally aggressive.
Paul Schwarz kept a modest collection of mixed Tiaris and Sporophila
species in a large flight cage at the Biological Research Station up in the
hills, including both T. bicolor and T. obscura (this latter appears in de
Schauensee as Sporophila obscura). This was at about 6,000 feet and he
found that the Sporophila did not do very well at that height whereas the
Tiaris appeared to cope, showing no discomfort. When all his birds were
moved down to sea-level, they all thrived equally well.

PESQUET'S PARROT Psittriehas fulgidus: SOME OBSERVATIONS
By S. F. De Jager (Bloemfontein, South Africa)

Pesquet's is a strange looking parrot and does not seem to fit into any of
the five groups of New Guinea's 45 species of parrot. My first impression
was that they were very similar in their movements to the Chattering Lory
Lorius garrula, for they twitch the body and flick the tail upwards while the
head is thrown downwards and forwards. Also, like lories, the cock will take
an extra hold of the perch with his bill and then turn himself upside down.
The hen can then walk over his toes, along the perch, and once she has
passed over him he will pull himself back to now stand on the other side of
the hen. But as Goffin's Cockatoo Cacatua sanguinea goffini also has a most
lory-like way of progressing, the similar movements of lories and Pesquet's
Parrot may be coincidental.
If Pesquet's Parrot cannot be included with the 21 species of New
Guinea lories (because it has a pig-like, smooth, pink tongue and not a
brush-tipped one) it fits even more incongruously with the four pygmy
parrots, the five fig parrots and the two cockatoos. It might have more
affinity with the diverse 12 species of what von Boetticher calls the "coral-
billed" parrots: the Eclectus, King, Crimson-wing, hanging parrot
complex.

In August 1974 I imported two pairs of Pesquet's or Vulturine Parrot:
they came out of quarantine on September 2nd. One hen died shortly after
this but the three prospered. Through the winter of 1975-76 they agreed
well together. On most nights there was frost and twice the temperature
fell to minus 8*C but rose well above zero by 9 a.m. and these winter days
were always pleasantly warm.
When first obtained, the birds were fed like lorikeets: a mixture of
"Farex", boiled rice, condensed milk and honey mixed with water to a thin
consistency and given twice daily together with banana and apple. As
Farex is not readily obtainable in South Africa, the diet was gradually
changed to a mixture of J pint of "Pronutro", one dessertspoonful of honey
and the same of condensed milk mixed up in one and a half pints of water.
They are also given two bananas and a large apple each afternoon. Once a
week a teaspoonful of multivitamins is added to the mixture and paw-paw
(papaya) given when in season: as yet they eat no green food.
Since an attempted breeding, I have started adding dog food to the
mixture as an extra source of protein, and this new recipe is taken very
readily.
The aviary is 30 x 6 x 6 feet with an open-fronted shelter at each narrow
end. Six feet of the centre of the aviary is covered and in the shade of this

the opposite side adjoins other aviaries and a passage. The Pesquet's
Parrots love to bathe in a spray of water falling from a sprinkler in the top of

Three nest boxes were given: one was open topped and of wood,
measuring 2x2x2 feet. The second was also of wood but had a large
entrance hole near the top and a welded ladder inside: this was a foot taller.
The one in which the parrots nested was a three foot long spindle-shaped
"log" cut from an American aloe with a centre bulge about 20 inches in
diameter while the ends were about nine inches: one of the ends was
closed. The nesting chamber was cleaned out by the mother; the male did
nothing to help, and the eggs lay on about two inches of litter chewed from
the inside. The wooden nest boxes were badly damaged by chewing.
Initially both cocks would sometimes feed the hen: however by August
it was obvious that a pair had been formed for the odd bird always kept his
distance. There appeared to be no fighting as the males got on well to-
gether. The pair sat close but not often close enough to physically touch.
Sometimes they would playfully fondle each other's beak; far less
frequently each lightly preened the back of the other's neck. The cock was
seen to stretch his neck and wave it underneath the body of the hen: the
hen did this also but far less frequently.
The hen asked the cock to feed her by crouching on the perch with her
head moving backwards and forwards while she gave soft begging calls,
and the cock gave the same sounds as he approached to feed her. After
courtship feeding, both sexes would clean their bills on the perch. On
September 9th I first saw them pairing and this took place every day until
the hen laid. Mating sometimes followed courtship feeding: the hen would
solicit for mating by crouching low on the perch, as if she were begging to
be fed, I cannot recollect her making a noise; her wings were also lifted
away from the body. The male would make a soft noise as he mounted the
hen to mate: sometimes he would change from one side to another and
might dismount from the opposite side. However on the few times that he
did change over and make a second attempt I am led to believe he changed
his position because of an incorrect stance on the hen. Copulation did not take
as long as with Australian broadtails, and when mounted, the male stretch-
ed his neck and held it alongside the hen's neck while he swayed his tail
from side to side. When the tail dropped for pairing his neck arched and the
head was held at the base of her neck: he did not move the head up and
down rhythmically. They were very docile and peaceful with each other and
neither sex was dominant. It was seen, however, that when the spare cock
was put back into the aviary after the chick had died that the hen became so
aggressive towards him that he had to be taken away within an hour; the
cock of the pair was always perfectly amicable with the second male.

Between the time of first mating until September 21st, when the first egg
was laid, food consumption dropped to about half of what it was previously.
On this date the hen disappeared into her aloe-log nest in the late afternoon
and stayed there until the late afternoon of the second day when I found
that she had laid her first egg: she later returned to the nest, but did not
brood overnight. The next morning she went back and then used to come
out morning and evening to be fed by her mate. Neither bird roosted in the
log at night except when the hen began brooding. The male never, at any
point in the breeding cycle, took to sleeping inside the log with the hen;
indeed he was noticeably reluctant to go into the nest to feed her, and
usually he would call her to the entrance or pursuade her to come out of the
log. When he did enter it was always to reappear very quickly. While the
hen was preparing the nest, prior to her laying, the cock sat on top of che
aloe log making soft sounds and peeping into the nest hole.
The second egg, to complete the clutch, was laid on September 26th--
four days later. The eggs measured 44.4 x 36.4 mm. and 44 x 34.6 mm.
After 40 days of incubation the hen deserted and I found one egg to be
infertile while the other contained a dead chick: the eggs went to the
National Museum in Bloemfontein. On the morning of December 6th I
found that the hen had laid again and, as before, the second followed four |
days later. This time incubation started with the first egg and one, it was
not known which, hatched on January 6th. The other egg, which was
infertile, went to the British Museum (Natural History), at Tring. After j
hatching, the mother sat closely and was aggressive: the chick was first
seen when two days old; it had a yellowish-white down.
A chick hatched from a pair in Chester Zoo and that died at a day old,
was examined by Mr. G. A. Smith of Peterborough, and he told me that
Mr. Timmis, the curator, observed that the yellow of the down was com-
pletely lost once the chick was dipped in formalin preservative. The down
was long but sparse, except at the base of the head. The down of the head
was extremely wide so that if it had been clipped short it would have re-
sembled the "bristly" down of Eclectus and Ring-necked Parrakeet chicks. \
The head, and particularly the bill, closely resembled that of a lory: the
preserved chick is now at Tring.
At 13 days old the skin of the chick was darker and the yellowish down
was gradually replaced by black down covering the entire body except that
the head now grew pale yellow, bristle-like feathers that stood erect. The
chick grew rapidly and was fed by both parents: when it was 25 days old
the mother stopped brooding it by day, but continued to do so at night. At
40 days old the first few black feathers could be seen on the back and breast
and feeding became less regular. By 60 days the front and the back were
well covered with feathers but the chick was bare on the rump and vent.The 1
colour pattern of red and black was like that of the adult: the red spot
behind the eye showed it to be a male. It was very strong and could easily
climb the 45 0 incline of the log to peer out of the entrance. By now, at 70

days, a red frontal band could be made out joining the two red spots of the
head: this band is not seen in adult birds. At this age the hen had stopped
brooding it at night. The weather remained warm and although the parents
appeared to feed it only in the morning and evening, the chick always
looked well fed. On April 2nd, when the chick was 87 days old, it was found
thin and hungry on the floor of the aviary: it was artificially fed with Pro-
nutro and placed on the top of the nest, but at 4 p.m. it was dead,
possibly because something was lacking in the diet.

For well over two years a pair of Luzon Bleeding Heart Doves Gallico -
lumba luzonica has been at home in a small, planted aviary, which it occupies
all to itself. During this time, the female has laid approximately one set of
eggs per month, most of which proved infertile. She would incubate the
eggs for three or four days, then abandon them, with the cock taking no
part whatever in the brooding.
Since I was very desirous of raising some young from this attractive,
lively pair of doves, I resorted to using a pair of Ringneck Doves to serve as
foster-parents. I am happy to report that, following many failures owing to
infertility, a setting of the Bleeding Heart eggs proved fertile. Four weeks
ago (I am writing these lines in the middle of August), the young squabs,
tiny creatures, hatched to my great satisfaction, for it is many a year since
I have had the good fortune to breed these beautiful and rare doves
successfully. Since the Ringneck Doves were quite tame, I have had--and
have now---ample opportunity to observe at very close range the growth
and development of the young Bleeding Hearts. When first hatched, they
were dark-brown in colour, almost black, both being about the same size. I
gave their foster-parents generous amounts of hard-boiled egg, diced
cheese, and protein-rich puppy biscuits finely ground, in addition to the
usual seed mixture which all my foreign doves get and relish. The Ring-
necks preferred the hard-boiled egg and the dog biscuits, and they do so to
this day.
As I was determined to raise these precious squabs, if need be by hand, I
checked on their being well cared for and well fed every single day, the
tame Ringnecks being not at all disturbed by this frequent interference in
their family affairs. The youngsters grew very rapidly, their usually well-
filled crops no doubt contributing definitely to their general well-being and
their remarkable development. At the age of ten days--I happened to be in
their aviary at the moment--I saw one of the young doves fluttering from
the nest box, which hangs four feet off the aviary floor, to a perch two feet
above the floor on which one of its foster-parents was sitting, and landing

there safely. Its nest-mate did not venture from the nest until the following
morning, when it dropped rather clumsily to the aviary floor. At this time
the plumage of the youngsters was a deep reddish-brown, their wing bars
already showing in somewhat lighter brown.
Since Bleeding Hearts are classified as ground dwellers, and since
Ringneck Doves are not accustomed to feeding their offspring on the
ground, I was fearful that if the little squabs would stay on the aviary
floor most of the time, perhaps hiding in the available bushy shrubbery, ]
their foster elders would not seek them out to feed them. However, my
fears proved unfounded! From the very beginning, the baby Bleeding !
Hearts showed themselves to be rather adept, though still somewhat :
clumsy, flyers. They did not remain on the aviary floor at all, but perched
well above it, usually beside one or the other foster-parent. Not having seen
me before, they were shy and flew vigorously against the quarter-inch
aviary netting whenever I came into their abode. They did this, even when
sitting beside their foster-parents, which, being thoroughly tame, toler- :
ated my presence quietly and did not leave their perch. A few days later, on i
my going into the aviary again and finding the young again sitting close be- I
side a foster-parent, they stayed with it, as if having "learned" meanwhile
that my presence presented no danger to them.
I have been delighted to see the young Bleeding Hearts grow larger
and stronger with almost every day of their young life. At two weeks of age
they were eating the soft food which their foster-parents like so much. !
With keen anticipation I have been watching the gradual change-over from j
the juvenal to the adult plumage, which today, when the youngsters are
four weeks old, is still very much proceeding, though very gradually. The I
principal change in plumage coloration is developing on the light-brown
breast of the young pair, where a narrow strip of grey is both widening and
whitening, now covering three-fourths of this area, having begun in the
middle of the breast. And now the first faint signs of the "bleeding heart"
are visible--a small, pinkish round spot in the midst of greyish-white
feathers: the abdomen is a brownish-grey and the feathers of the nape are a
shimmering green.
In other respects these young doves, being now independent and living j
in an aviary of their own, are more than half the size of their parents, and \
that at only four weeks of age! Their instinctive shyness reasserts itself i
when I approach them in their aviary, but I hope that in time they will i
adjust more and more quietly to my presence when I attend to their
wants--and hopefully become dependable breeders. I shall report again !
when their first breeding activities begin, thus continuing my fairly close
scrutiny of their behaviour.

THE PROBLEMS OF BREEDING SMALL
NECTAR-FEEDING BIRDS

By Richard Mark Martin (Padstow, Cornwall)
The breeding of even large softbills in difficult enough, but it seems that
the smaller they become, the greater are the problems. This may not be a
particularly clever remark but the difficulties were brought home to me in no
uncertain manner on the occasion of a brief return visit to the Tropical
Bird Gardens at Padstow in 1976. At the time I was involved in three
successive breeding attempts of a pair of Tacazze Sunbirds Nectarinia
tacazze --which have survived in fine condition in the tropical house
(see avicultural magazine 79 13, 89-93) since their arrival from Kenya in
1972.
In many ways these sunbirds have behaved predictably. After a seemingly
statutory settling-in period of three years, they began to show interest in
nest-building, and in 1975 actually built (eventually abandoning) a huge
formless structure which was suspended by strands of Ipomaea (morning
glory) some seven feet above a small waterfall.
Then in the spring of 1976, they began to court and to build again in the
same position. This time they seemed to know exactly what to do, having
perhaps learnt from the earlier failure but possibly also due to a wider
selection of building materials. We placed in the flight many kinds of
grasses, moss, coconut fibre, wood straw, shredded paper, sheep's wool
etc. The strongest and most pliable materials were selected, together with a
liberal amount of hairs from our dog, and a perfectly formed nest was
quickly built. The female did most of the work with the male looking on in
apparent bewilderment.
It was very noticeable that the sound or presence of running water ini-
tially stimulated the birds, and I venture to suggest that its provision might
prove to be an extremely important element in the procreative management
of some species at least. The pump which activates the water flow through
the pools and down the falls is little used during the winter months,
mainly for reasons of economy, but with it switched on every day from
early spring the sunbirds showed great excitement. Assuming that breeding
in the wild occurs following the rainy season when the rivers are in flux, it
is highly likely that, with the nest built to resemble flood debris, and achiev-
ing added protection and humidity from being directly above water, the
birds are conditioned to associating breeding with water movement.
Once the nest had been completed, by the end of March, it was lined
with a prodigious amount of feathers which the female sought for herself
(doves are extremely useful and generous in this respect) but which we
added to whenever the supply seemed to be running short. Again the male
took only minimal interest in anything other than the female.
The following extracts taken from our log-book (with additional com-

Incubation pattern seems to be alternating periods of about ten
minutes on and off the nest. Female seen to thoroughly bathe, male
bathing a lot. (As a precaution, one of us remained in the house
all day).
23 rd: For the first time the female stayed on the nest throughout cleaning
(in the morning). Not seen off all morning and only twice in the
afternoon. (Cleaning of the Tropical House takes about an
hour; invariably on my entry the female would be on the nest,
her head protruding from the entrance in her favourite attitude.
She soon left the nest but had always returned by the time I had
finished).
24 th: Spiders put in (in a steep-sided dish)-- inspected--one bashed
and taken up to nest. (This type of sunbird rearing food was
introduced so as to familiarise the adults with it).

Found half the eggshell which had been deposited some distance
from the nest. Female catching fruit-flies from wing and perch.
Male chivvying, Still ignoring spiders. (The coloration of the
egg was of dark brown blotches on a dull blue ground merging
at the larger end [as is usual] to overall shades of grey/brown).
28 th: Found other half of eggshell when looking for faecal sac which
the female was seen to lean in and take from nest after having fed
young from outside. Carried to and dropped at same place as earlier
eggshell find.
Took c$o spiders (fed ad lib.).
29 th: Took c$$ spiders (fed ad lib.).

visited nest but did not feed. Both bathed--male stimulating
female to do so--both preened, female then visited nest and
settled down. 1400 hrs Eating and visiting nest less.
1535 hrs Nest empty; female taking up feathers again. (The
whole episode had lasted a month).
May 10 th: Back on nest. Sitting much of the day. (First egg of second
clutch laid today).
nth: Observed mating (for the very first time), more like rape! Female
flew down to the ground with the male on top of her, consumated at
ground level with the female shrieking constantly. Female on nest
thirty minutes later after inspection had revealed one egg.

mately half as much Farlene, a tiny amount of Virol and
diluted honey or invert sugar. Amounts and even ingredients
are varied occasionally so that the diet never becomes boring,
and, of course, in a well planted tropical house the birds have
access to a wide variety of natural nectar and pollen).
27 th: Early morning found nest to have swivelled due to rotten support-
ing strand of morning glory. Re-hung with wire , adults scolded ,
heard chicks inside , inspection revealed two. Female not put off by
activity.
29 th: Nest found to be empty again in early morning , Day 4, as last
time. In afternoon female again took feathers up. (NB. No spiders
were offered on this occasion).
June 6 th: On nest again--one egg.
21 st: Hatched , one eggshell found in pool.
24 th: Young vanished again. Adults seen mating.
25 th: Back on nest again.
After considering various possibilities, we are now beginning to think
that the male sunbird is the most likely culprit, although we have never
found one of the chicks. A Woodland Kingfisher Halcyon senegalensis was
once suspected but has now been cleared as there is no way in which it could
remove the chicks from the nest without wrecking the whole frail structure:
also whenever it ventures too close, the sunbirds scold loudly and have even
been seen to chase it off. Of course it is possible that this kingfisher con-
sumed any chick, living or dead, thrown from the nest by the parents.
Such are the problems, then, of prospective breeders of this kind of bird,
and such are the problems which have to be solved if we are to go on keeping
them with a clear conscience.

PREDATORY BEHAVIOUR OF APLOMADO FALCONS
IN CAPTIVITY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995493175" page_id="56381794"  page_num="169" year="" vol="">
By John C. Snelling (Oklahoma City Zoo) and
Beth E. Leuck (University of Oklahoma)
Very little is known about the Aplomado Falcon Falco femoralis aside
from mostly anecdotal information (Bent 1938, Brown and Amadon 1968,
Johnson 1965). Basically a Neotropical species, this small raptor ranges into
the south-western United States, but is now extremely rare there. Some
information on the predatory behaviour of captive Aplomado Falcons is
presented here, in the hope that it will increase our knowledge of a little
known species. Since 1972 the Oklahoma City Zoo has displayed three
Aplomado Falcons. Two birds (one female, one sex unknown) were obtain-
ed from an animal dealer in Oklahoma in February 1972; they were
probably of South American origin. A male was obtained on breeding loan
from the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum in April 1974, having come
originally from an animal dealer in Florida; it too is likely to be a South
American bird. In September 1974 one of the original birds apparently
escaped from the cage.
The falcons occupy a large outdoor flight cage, designed to exhibit
fauna and flora of the Patagonian region of South America. The cage,
through which visitors may walk, occupies about 0.26 ha. and is 61.0 by
43.0 m. varying from 8.5 to 21.0 m. high. The superstructure consists of
metal support poles, steel cable, and 5.0 by 5.0 cm. welded wire mesh. The
outside of a building forms part of the south-west wall, and a gunite (sprayed
concrete) artificial mountain extends along half the length of the exhibit.
The entire area is heavily planted, and there are numerous pools, streams
and waterfalls throughout.
The species composition and number of animals in the exhibit vary
seasonally, but usually about 75 specimens are in residence. Rodents are
the chief mammals, and birds of ten orders are represented. In the summer
iguanid lizards and land tortoises are also in evidence. Because of easy
access and abundance of food, Norway Rats Rattus norvegicus and House
Mice Mus musculus are common pests: in addition, wild birds such as
House Sparrows Passer domesticus , Starlings Sturnus vulgaris , Cardinals
Cardinalis cardinalis and Blue Jays Cyanocitta cristata also frequent the
area at will.
The diet supplied to raptors in the exhibit consists of day-old cockerels
(killed and frozen), a commercial birds of prey diet and chicken parts
(mostly necks) fed once daily. The Aplomado Falcons seem to prefer the
day-old chicks.
From December 1972 to January 1975 the falcons were observed on 12
occasions eating avian prey that they had probably captured alive. Three

Starlings were eaten by the male, four Starlings and one House Sparrow by
a female, and three Starlings and a House Sparrow were eaten by the falcon
of undetermined sex. We are confident that a large proportion of these
observations followed actual predation, for on two occasions a female
Aplomado Falcon was observed catching and killing Starlings. In both
instances the prey was perched on the wire mesh in the north-west
quarter of the exhibit when the falcon grabbed and pulled it inside. At the
point of capture the mesh was vertical, and the area shaded by trees.
Starlings rest momentarily in this area when entering or leaving the cage,
using the horizontal wire strands for perches. The falcon seemed to dive
onto the wire, and in one instance she killed the Starling before separating it
from the wire mesh. On both occasions, she took the prey elsewhere be-
fore starting her meal.
Because of their size in relation to the area of the exhibit, the Aplomado
Falcons are able to fly around the area almost without interruption; flights
of five minutes' duration or more are not uncommon. The birds often
cling to the wire, especially at the upper corners. In light of the observed
prey captures, this active behaviour would seem to be a part of hunting
rather than escape; apparently the falcons have learned that Starlings
perched on the wire mesh are vulnerable. On one occasion unsuccessful
attempted predation of a Starling followed the same pattern as the success-
ful kills. Once, while perched in a dead tree, the male initiated pursuit of a
Starling as it flew past. Arriving at the wire mesh about 0.5 m. before the
falcon, the Starling made good its escape. In four instances, the female
falcon was seen chasing a Starling in flight through the exhibit, the prey
emitting alarm calls. Once, while perched, the female was observed intently
watching House Sparrows in the bush beneath her; she dived into the
bush, but failed to make a kill. This hunting method may correspond with
two instances when the male was seen on the ground, underneath bushes,
with a freshly killed Starling.
Ten of the wild kills occurred in the period November through February.
This is the time when cold winter weather might stimulate a caged predator,
fed only once a day, to hunt on its own; furthermore, the deciduous
vegetation of the exhibit is leafless during these months, rendering prey
more vulnerable. A wooden ledge about half way up the south-east wall of
the exhibit was littered with Starling remains in December and apparently
the Aplomado Falcons use this area as a food cache.
Bent (1938), and Brown and Amadon (1968) state that the Aplomado
Falcon takes a wide range of prey in the wild, including insects, reptiles,
birds and mammals. A summary of their remarks follows. Like many
insectivorous birds, it utilizes grass fires as hunting sites. It hovers, on
occasion, like the American Kestrel Falco sparverius . Pairs have been seen
hunting co-operatively, especially for avian prey. Also while hunting
birds, stealthy tactics like those of the accipiters and direct pursuit like that
of other bird-oriented falcons (Falco columbarius , F. peregrinus , and F.

mexicanus) have been seen in the wild; both of these hunting methods are
described here for the zoo environment.
Of apparent differences in hunting behaviour, D. Amadon (pers.
comm.) reports "Two in immature plumage that I saw in Mexico were
rather languidly making sallies from the top of a dead tree after insects.
On the other hand, we saw three ripping down a dry wash in Argentina at a
tremendous clip."
In the wild, prey the size of Rock Doves Columba livia (Brown and
Amadon 1968) and tinamous (Johnson 1965) has been recorded, under-
scoring the Aplomado Falcon's ability to kill relatively large birds; Rock
Doves outweigh even the largest female Aplomado Falcons. Our observa-
tions indicate that neither sex has difficulty in handling Starlings. A male
falcon of 235 g. (Brown and Amadon 1968) which carries an 84 g. Starling
(Roberts 1955) up to a perch from the ground, lifts 35 per cent of its body
weight.
Our 12 observations do not show sexual differences in prey selectivity
as seen in some raptors (Storer 1966). The male caught Starlings ex-
clusively, and the female took Starlings with the exception of a single
House Sparrow. However, we cannot be certain that some prey items
were not presented to the female in courtship feeding; small bits of a day-
old chick were transferred this way on January yth 1975, a good indication
that the birds are indeed a pair. This was the only courtship behaviour
seen, and there have been no nesting activities recorded.
Many caged creatures are somewhat less than in harmony with their
environment because of a number of sub-optimum factors, namely, lack
of adequate space, appropriate food, and potential mates. The trend toward
large, often mixed species exhibits, and enlightened husbandry practices
has made it possible for zoo animals to be more comfortable in confinement,
and perhaps to show more significant behaviour patterns. We believe that
the Aplomado Falcons described here exhibit a unique compatibility with
cage life, rarely described before.

BOTULISM IN CAPTIVE BIRDS
By George A Smith (Peterborough)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999702853658536" page_id="56381797"  page_num="172" year="" vol="">
Before 1974, botulism was infrequently reported as killing wild, or
captive, birds in Britain. The exceptionally dry and hot summers of the
past two years changed this situation and botulism which, I suppose, is best
described as a "food poisoning" has now become a very serious problem in
European aviculture. In consequence the Editor has asked me to contribute
this short article.
Many of the 'saprophytes', that is the fungi and bacteria which feed upon
dead animals and plants and cause them to decay, secrete powerful toxins
which serve to prevent other saprophytes from growing and competing
with them for food. Not surprisingly some of these 'toxins', when isolated,
have proved to be of quite exceptional importance in medicine; for when
they are given to an animal (people are animals) suffering from some bac-
terial or fungal disease, they can kill off, or weaken, the organisms produc-
ing the disease. Well known examples of such useful saprophytic 'toxins'
are the drugs penicillin and streptomycin; and such 'useful' phytotoxins
are universally referred to as 'antibiotics'.
But there are other bacteria which secrete toxins that are extraordinarily
poisonous to most other higher forms of life. For example; a small number
of tetanus bacteria growing in an otherwise insignificant, although dirt-
containing, wound can easily produce sufficient toxin to kill the host with
"lock jaw". And, before the days of antibiotics and vaccination, a colony of
other bacterial species growing within the throat used annually to kill
hundreds of people with diphtheria and scarlet fever.
In 1896 a bacteriologist proved that the several people who had died of a
rapid paralysis, following a village festival, were the victims of a toxin
produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum which had contaminated
a ham. Botulism, because the organism requires special circumstances in
which to grow, has never been a particularly common disease. In parts of
South Africa cattle which graze pasture that is deficient in the minerals
necessary to form bone, actively search out and eat the bones of dead
animals, and if the carcass has been polluted with Cl. botulinum the cattle
die of botulism. Dead tortoises are responsible in parts of Africa for
botulism in sheep on mineral-deficient pastures.
The 'type C' botulism, which affects birds, is well known in waterfowl.
Outbreaks usually happen in warm weather, either after a persistent
drought has severely reduced the surface areas of ponds and lakes or when
flooding has submerged land vegetation. In such warm conditions the
amount of oxygen dissolved in the water is minimal and Cl. botulinum is said
to grow in the decaying vegetation. However, as warm water with very
little oxygen dissolved in it kills fish and most other forms of water life, it
may be that the botulinum bacteria flourish in the dead water animals. If

this is so, then the waterfowl become poisoned by consuming the inverte-
brates, such as blow-fly maggots, that have grown on this putrescent
flesh. Certain experimental evidence, from the field, appears to support
this hypothesis.
Cases of botulism in broiler chicks are often very difficult to explain
(Roberts et ah 1973), unless it is that the birds have acquired their fatal
dosages from eating the floor litter. My constant finding of fly-maggots in
the similarly nitrogen-rich litter of damp nest boxes, when the weather is
warm, causes me to query whether similar maggots might be bred in the
litter of broiler sheds and that these are eaten by the birds and so cause the
botulism?
Maggots are very important as a source of botulism in pheasants and
caged birds and two recent cases emphasise this. On the Norfolk Broads
summer botulism has occurred in wild birds almost annually since 1969
with particularly serious outbreaks in 1975 and 1976. Botulism had not
been previously diagnosed in reared pheasants in this country: which is
surprising, as it frequently kills pheasants in the United States. However,
on a game farm but a few miles from the broads, there was a most severe
outbreak in July of 1976 in which 1,050 (that is 84 per cent) of 1,250 eight
and nine week-old poults died in a single fortnight. The veterinary investi-
gator, Edith Borland (1976) suggested that the main factor precipitating
this catastrophe was the persistent hot dry weather that started in early
June. And any dead animal, or bird, in the pheasant release pens, would
have soon become fly-blown, then maggotty, and pheasants are avid eaters
of maggots. Mrs Borland remarked that pheasants show a tendency to
cannibalise dead or ailing birds and that this also might have aided the
spread of botulism and explain the rather explosive nature of this outbreak.
Most losses with aviculturists have been caused by feeding maggots
contaminated with the botulinus toxin and, very likely, the responsible
bacterium. It is generally held that the preformed toxin is the sole source of
the intoxication and that no further toxin is elaborated after ingestion.
In the nature of things many cases have never been reported: certainly in
1975 and 1976 I had several people telephone to ask what might have so
suddenly killed a large part of their collections. No material has been
received, but circumstantial evidence strongly supports my belief that
many of these losses were due to botulism. Diagnosis cannot be done on a
post-mortem examination as there are no post-mortem changes attributable
to botulism; however bacterial culture and the use of mice or guinea pigs,
which are very sensitive to botulinus toxin, will confirm.
Maggots delivered on the afternoon of Friday, December 20th, 1974,
from a commercial breeder, were fed to about 250 birds that evening in
the collection of the Zoological Society of London (Smith et ah 1975).
Several birds were ill the following morning and during the course of the
day 14 died. Maggot feeding was immediately stopped but on the 22nd
seven further birds died and the loss continued for a further four days until

GEORGE A. SMITH--BOTULISM IN BIRDS

<bodyText confidence="0.999590153846154" page_id="56381799"  page_num="174" year="" vol="">
the final death toll was 37. The majority of the affected birds were pas-
serines, but turacos, a toucan, a pigeon and a hombill were included. The
dealer had supplied three further bird collections from the same batch of
maggots, and these also had a high loss, but reptiles and amphibia were
unaffected. It was thought that the most likely origin of the toxin was
poultry offal upon which the maggots were raised.
Diagnosis can only be confirmed by laboratory tests. Edith Borland
(loc. cit.) said of the affected pheasants that they sat around with the
wings drooping and in a hunched position. Some showed an intermittent
flaccid paralysis of the head and neck. When approached, most affected
birds could rise and run away a few feet before collapsing, but this exertion
exacerbated the paralysis. Ailing pheasants that were still able to get up and
run away became completely paralysed and died within half an hour of
being seen.
In the London Zoo outbreak, the affected birds showed a characteristic
statuesque behaviour. Some individuals stood motionless for over an ,
hour despite the activity of the other birds, and the hospital staff, around
them. All affected birds refused to eat for at least 24 hours: the iris was
paralysed and the limbs to varying extents ranging from a single dropped
wing to a complete paralysis of both legs. Death in these cases, as is typical,
probably came because of an obvious difficulty in breathing, due to a
paralysis of the respiratory muscles. In waterfowl the neck becomes
paralysed as one of the most obvious of the effects of the toxin-hence the
alternative name of "limberneck".
Prevention, for unless the birds are not fatally intoxicated all treatments
seem ineffective, is the only means of keeping this disease away from
one's collection. Primarily all dead animals and birds should be removed
before they have had time to become fly-blown or eaten by the other birds.
The pond water for ducks and geese ought to be aereated by recycling
through a pump, if a through-flow from a natural stream is not possible.
Anyone who feeds maggots risks the possibility of botulism. Maggots are
best 'cleaned' before being fed by allowing them to burrow into bran,
sawdust or, if one wants 'extras', in Farex or other vitamin/mineral/cereal
mixtures. This may remove much of the botulinus toxin. If possible it
might be wise to adopt the practice of ancient Kings and first feed some of
each batch to a 'less valuable' individual before giving them to the general
collection. The only treatment is force-feeding, but whether it is advisable
to handle birds in such a precarious state of nervous paralysis is debatable,
unless the birds are very tame.

BREEDING OF ANDEAN FLAMINGOS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99661592" page_id="56381801"  page_num="176" year="" vol="">
In 1974 our group of Andean Flamingos Phoenicoparrus andinus, living
with six James's Flamingos Phoenicoparrus jamesi, built three mud nests,
and one egg was laid in June, but it was infertile. Even so the fact that the
birds had started nesting raised our hopes for breeding success in the
following year. In June 1975 two eggs were laid, one of them fertile and
after 31 days, on July 16th a chick hatched. It had a pink beak and legs,
unlike the known chicks of other species, but this colour changed to
black after ten days. During the first fortnight the chick did not leave
the nest but after that it followed its parents. Although this chick grew
quickly during the first weeks, it suddenly became weak and refused food,
so it was artificially fed, but without success and on September 4th it died
from a degeneration of the liver.
Despite this failure, this partial success was important because the
chick was only the fourth to have been hatched in captivity, three having
been hatched at the Wildfowl Trust, Slimbridge, in 1962 and 1969, two of
them being successfully reared.
In 1976 the Andean Flamingos laid three eggs on June 5th, 15th and 16th.
The last one was broken and after 29 days, on July 4th and 14th, two
chicks hatched. The younger one died from pneumonia on August 3rd; the
other is still alive (mid-October) and in excellent condition. The main
factor in this breeding success is the special diet given to the birds, both
Andean and James's Flamingos. It consists of a mixture of special poultry
meal, corn meal, pulverised lucerne and algae, wheat meal, coarsely ground
shrimps, cornflakes, soaked white bread, red "pepper" powder, a gruel
made from oatmeal and rice flour, vitamins, Vitakalk and milk powder.

etc. All these species are still breeding there, but their habitat is threatened
by cultivation and therefore the W.W.F. tries to buy these areas. The
Berlin Zoo is contributing to most of these projects and has already given
DM 85000 during recent years to save the threatened regions.
A very interesting project supported by the Berlin Zoo is the breeding of
Peregrine Falcons in captivity. The first to start such a project was the
ornithological staff at Cornell, Ithaca, New York, where since 1973, 68
birds have been reared and 16 of them set free in eastern parts of the
United States where the species had become extinct and where now 12 of
the released birds are reported as settled.
A similar project was started in West Germany where the wild popula-
tion of Peregrine Falcons is only a matter of dozens and in West Berlin an
institution is already very successful in breeding them. With the financial
support of our Zoo visitors, new aviaries can be built so that this project can
be accelerated. Soon the first of the captive bred falcons can be set free.

MYNAH BIRDS. By Rosemary Low. 1976. Published by John
Bartholomew &amp; Sons, Ltd. Edinburgh and Bromley. Cloth-backed or
reinforced paper covers. No price on review copy.
Rosemary Low, well-known for her success in keeping, breeding and
writing about various parrots, here turns her attention to some of the
starlings, Sturnidae. Rather over half the book deals with the keeping of
the Hill Myna (or Mynah, as she or her publishers prefer to spell it)
Gracula religiosa (formerly Eulahes religiosa), the "Talking Myna" par
excellence. The rest deals, slightly less fully, with some of the starlings (or
mynas) in the genera Sturms , Acridotheres , Leucopsar and Ampeliceps .
The Rose-coloured Starling or Rosy Pastor Sturnus roseus and our own
beautiful if ubiquitious Sturnus vulgaris are not included among the
Sturnus species described, presumably because they are not called "mynas"
in avicultural circles.
Each species described is illustrated by a coloured drawing. These vary
in quality but at their best are most lively and pleasing. I particularly liked
the Pagoda Starling (sorry, myna!) on p. 73. Even at their worst these
pictures are, in my opinion, far better than much of the costly and preten-
tious rubbish that, in recent years, has been foisted onto a gullible and
undiscriminating public as, allegedly, superb bird art.
Not only are the birds illustrated in colour, but also the various foods,
cages and equipment recommended, so those readers in any doubt about
the basic differences between a cockroach and a grasshopper, the shape of a
pear or which end of a banana to peel open first, will need to look no
further.
The reviewer has no experience of keeping these birds himself, but even
so doubts the implication in the (literally true) statement (p.66) that the
mainly ground-feeding species in the genera Sturnus and Acridotheres
"require exactly the same care in feeding and housing" as the arboreal
Hill Myna. Under the specific headings the authoress has, however, given
full information (when available in the literature) on the care and feeding of
each species by those who have successfully bred it in captivity.
Rosemary Low's love of and consideration for birds shines through all
her writing. She rightly insists that any myna kept in the wretchedly
small commercially produced myna cages should at least be allowed
frequent liberty in the room. She also wisely stresses the drawbacks involv-
ed in myna keeping. All in all a literally handy little work that can be
warmly recommended.

Nesting of the Long-tailed Sylph Hummingbird
I have, for some two and a half years, kept hummingbirds in an outside
aviary which is heated in winter and which measures 8x6x6 feet high.
The aviary has a wooden sheltered part and is planted with a variety of
climbing plants and shrubs such as honeysuckle, passion flower, rhodo-
dendron, etc. and in it is a pool with a fountain.
In addition to a pair of Long-tailed Sylphs Aglaiocercus kingi there were
three sugar birds, a sunbird and five other hummingbirds in this aviary.
On December 13th 1975 when I was taking down some nesting boxes of
the type provided for Zebra Finches, the female sylph flew out and I dis-
covered a nest in one of these boxes containing two eggs on which she sat
for 21 days, but the eggs were infertile. She laid again in the same nest
around January 24th 1976 and these eggs were also infertile. On July 4th
and 6th two more eggs were laid and after 16 days two chicks hatched. I
had to go away at about this time, but before going I put all the other birds
into another aviary, leaving the pair of sylphs alone, but when I returned I
found only one chick surviving and it lived until it was 21 days old, but I
do not know the cause of death.
The nest was composed of sheep's wool and fibre glass of the kind used
for roof insulation: the birds are fed on fruit flies and a nectar mixture
consisting of a teaspoon of natural pollen, one of Super Hydramin, 3 J ozs
sugar and a very small quantity of Bovril, all mixed with one pint of hot
water; the mixture when cooled is kept in a refrigerator. Mr M. F. Draper
who saw the nest and chicks very kindly gave me advice and so did Mr. and
Mrs. Scamell.

Luscinia svecica
By Robin L. Restall (Caracas, Venezuela)
The Bluethroat is a widespread species ranging and breeding over much
of Europe, from Scandinavia to Spain, and eastward right across Asia to as
far as Alaska. In this enormous range, with varying migration patterns,
some eight subspecies are recognised, two of which are known to British
aviculturists.
The first is the nominate race, normally known as the Red-spotted
Bluethroat because of the red spot at the centre of the blue gorget. This
bird is the most widespread race, being known in Scandinavia, Germany,
France and farther to the east, and some individuals from Sweden and
Norway pass through Britain on passage to and from northern Africa: there
is a record of a nesting of the Bluethroat in Scotland (Inverness) in 1968.
The second is the White-spotted Bluethroat L. s. cyanecula which ranges
from south-western Russia south-westwards in a broad sweep until its
distribution peters out in central Spain. The bird is about 5J inches long
and the adults readily sexable, but some females, particularly older birds,
may show the occasional blue and/or chestnut feather on the throat and may
be taken for immature males that are moulting from the juvenile plumage.
Juveniles very closely resemble juvenile Robins Erithacus rubecula , but
may be immediately distinguished by the rufous patches at the base of the
outer tail feathers.
The natural habitat of the Bluethroat is heavy vegetation, preferably in
damp or marshy areas and, every time that I have found the white-
spotted form it has been in this situation. In an aviary they have a skulking
habit which will make them disappointing species for the aviculturist who
likes to have his birds well displayed, but this is a small price to pay for
keeping them in optimum condition.
The natural diet is insects characteristic of the habitat, but in fact

Bluethroats are not particularly choosy and will take small earthworms,
small snails, beetles, grasshoppers and all manner of insect life. They
naturally take berries and other succulent vegetable matter particularly in
the autumn and winter, and in this way they are characteristic of many
thrushes. They are well able to adapt to the kind of diet offered by most
aviculturists, but are much easier to establish in confinement in the autumn
than in spring when their metabolism is more geared to insects. I have j
found them easy to "meat off" within a week by offering a variety of soft
foods and the generous use of mealworms. Details of the diet given to j
captive birds can be found in the Magazine (1975, no. 4) in articles by Mr.
M. Barber and myself.
The Bluethroat is a fine songbird, displaying many of the characteristics j
of the Nightingale Luscinia megarhynchus but, if anything, it has a finer j
power of mimicry. It has some of the liquid notes of the Robin and will
willingly and repeatedly sing during the night. The Red-spotted Blue- !
throat is naturally single brooded, but the White-spotted is more often
double brooded, as is so often the case with the more southerly races of j
wide ranging northern hemisphere species. It was, of course, this form j
that Mr. Barber bred in 1975 and it characteristically nested twice during :
the season. I

Alisterus a. amboinensis
By John Burgess (Plymouth, Devon)
Introduction
The late E.N.T. Vane had an example of a Salawatti Island King
Parrakeet A.a.dorsalis 3 a bird previously owned by the 13th Duke of
Bedford. Since then, except for a single importation in 1969 by John
Wilson, of Norwich, the island king parrakeets were not available to the i
trade until 1972/73: since that time somewhere between two and three j
hundred might have been brought into the country. Many of these were ill 1
on arrival and others refused to be weaned from their staple diet of boiled i
maize and paddy rice and they gradually faded into death. Altogether I |
doubt if there are more than 70 still alive in the U.K. j
The most commonly imported race was the Amboina, often advertised l
as "Red-billed Kings", with smaller numbers of the Buru Island King 1
Parrakeet A.a.buruensis, incorrectly designated "Salawatti's" or "Black-
billed Kings" and one or two of the Sula Island A.a.suluensis. This year,
1976, the very beautiful Halmahera King A. a . hypophonius has been in the

Indonesian dealers' lists; but the very high price asked (#1,000 or more, a
pair), the knowledge that many (must) would die before they were acclima-
tised and the stringent importation restrictions make it most unlikely that
any will enter the U.K., although they are now represented in Continental
collections.
The island kings differ from the Australian King Parrakeet A.scapularis
by having a very much longer and broader tail and in having the hen the
same colour as the cock. They also lift their scratching foot over the wing
to the head; the Australian King moves it under the wing. They are also
more arboreal and readily enter dark or confined spaces. At night, some-
times when it is too dark to see them, they will fly about. This is done as
part of their natural behaviour and is not panic, for my aviaries are in a
walled garden, the walls topped with an electric fence to keep cats away.
Breeding
Like the very closely related Green-winged King Parrakeet A.chloropterus
of central and eastern New Guinea, they appear to take several years be-
fore they reach a breeding maturity and once they start, they appear ready
enough to lay annually. My three pairs of Amboina Kings were bought in
1973: each pair is housed in 7-foot high aviaries with a floor area of 20 x 3
feet, surfaced with stone chippings. A small shelter 4 feet high x 3 feet
wide and 3 J feet deep is attached to each flight.
The nest boxes of 2 cm. thick exterior grade plywood are of the grand-
father clock type, 10 inches square inside and 6 feet high with a 4-inch
diameter entrance hole. These are rammed, 15 inches deep, with a mixture
of peat and earth, and then capped with two inches of crumbled rotten
wood.
I believe that hens may be separated from cocks because of their
smaller heads making the eye nearer to the cere. Last year one hen laid
eggs but her mate died of an accident: fortunately I easily acquired another
male. When I put in the nest boxes on February 8th, this hen, and the
cock, entered the same day: that both sexes go into the box is rather curious.
Within four days courtship began in earnest. Both sexes, but particularly
the cock, "eye blaze" with such intensity that the red/yellow iris could be
easily seen almost as a glow, 30 yards away. The persistent chatter is not
unlike that of courting Crimson-wings Aprosmictus erythropterus. The
male would jump up and down as he paraded alongside the hen when on
the ground, often with a twig held in the bill; he would also hold his head
high and, like a cock Princess of Wales' Polytelis alexandrae , blaze his eyes
and sway his head from side to side. Before regurgitatory feeding of the
hen, the cock would sometimes swing his head in a circle; again like a cock
Princess of Wales.
An egg was laid on February 16th; it was very cold at the time and she
deserted after five days. However, a fortnight later she laid her normal
clutch of two eggs and immediately began to incubate: again we had a cold

spell and she deserted a week after. Her next dutch was laid on April 5th
and 7th. On the 27th a freshly hatched chick was found with a bloody
scratch on its back. The hen had no further interest in the nest so the cold,
second, egg was tested in warm water to see if the contained chick was still
alive. As it did not react I started to carefully open the top of the egg
when, to my horror, it began to bleed and I could see the chick moving
inside. The egg was promptly put under a Mealy Rosella Flatycercus
adscitus which, by good fortune, had just hatched a chick of her own. To
my delight I found both chicks alive and full of food the next day. The
Amboina cock started to fight his hen so I took her away for two days.
Quite a difference was found between the two chicks: the King stood up-
right calling for food whilst the Mealy had a crouched position. Mr. G. A.
Smith tells me that Ringneck Psittacula krameri, Eclectus Eclectus roratus
and Princess of Wales 9 , indeed all red-billed parrots, similarly stand up-
right. The chicks were brought inside after a fortnight because I felt that
the parents were neglecting them. First they were fed on "Farex"---a baby
cereal food--mixed with water and given at blood-heat. Subsequently
various items were added to this mix including strained apple, vitamin
drops and honey. The feeds were given at four-hourly intervals so that.
with the first being given on awaking and the last before retiring they had 1
five a day. When 17 days old the eyes were nearly fully open and at 18 days
the red-tipped tail feathers could be made out as could the primary
feathers at 20 days. Now crushed carrot, shelled sunflower seeds and
grated spinach were added to the diet. At 22 days blue and green feathers
were visible on the wings and the red and blue ones of the tail. Growth was
very fast so that by 38 days old the chick was fully feathered and it and its ;
companion Mealy were put into a large flight cage. From then on soaked
and shelled seed, seeding grasses and spinach were supplied daily. At 48
days old the Amboina chick was perching and preening itself easily and j
also picking up the seeds--in play. By June 30th the chick only needed |
feeding twice a day and I released the two into a small flight on the 6th
July: the Amboina chick was then the size of the parents.
Astonishingly the parents went to nest for a fourth time; the first egg
arrived on July 13th and the second two days later. Five days afterwards
the cock was seen driving the hen so I took him away and put him into an
adjacent aviary. These eggs hatched after 19 days: as the hen seemed to be
doing such a good job and the weather continued very warm, so there was no .
fear that the chicks might chill, I did not return the cock. She reared the
two chicks entirely on her own, feeding them mainly on hemp seed and
bread and milk of which she was eventually eating two slices a day. The
chicks fledged at nine weeks old when the hen went back to eating mainly
sunflower seed. The young differ from their parents in that the peri-
orbital skin is white, not black, and the eye is very dark, almost black. The
tips of the tail feathers are red: they are black in the adults. A beautiful and
rather surprising feature of these chicks is that the red of their chests and

heads is so much more pure and deep in hue than that of their parents.
The chicks at three weeks could well have fed themselves although the hen
still fed them a little.
As described, the Amboina Island King Parrakeet Alisterus amboinensis

captive breeding successes achieved and one, among those known to
aviculturists, is quite definitely notable for the lack of successes. The Pionus
are smallish parrots, measuring between 9 and 11 in (23 and 28 cm),
readily distinguished by the red under tail-coverts. Only the Blue-headed
P. menstruus is well known in captivity; it has been bred on a few occasions
but breeding successes with the other members of the genus are rare--
non-existent in some species. One reason is, of course, the small number of
birds from which breeding has been attempted. When preparing the
parrots of south America (in 1971) I could obtain no information at all on
breeding Pionus . At that time I had three species in my possession--a
single female White-crowned P. senilis which I eventually lent to someone
with a male, a pair of Massena's P. seniloides and two Bronze-winged
Parrots. To my great regret, the female Massena's was killed by the male
and, after three years, I discovered that the Bronze-wings were two
females!
In 1970 I had obtained one which, I was reasonably certain, was a male:
later in the year I bought another and judged by its smaller build, especially
about the head, and its quieter demeanour, that it was a hen. The two birds
showed not the slightest interest in each other; however, subsequent events
were to prove that even true pairs seem to lack the affectionate disposition
displayed by almost all South American parrots and are rarely seen to
preen each other.
I persisted in thinking that I probably had a true pair, but in April 1973 I
was offered a Bronze-wing from the collection of the late Mrs. N. Howard. I
bought it and introduced it into the aviary containing both birds, as I felt
that this would provide a better indication of their sex. The reaction of my
believed male was immediate: he displayed in typical Pionus fashion, fan-

ning his tail and walking along the perch with exaggerated gait. He began
to behave aggressively towards his former companion which now became a
rival; however, the latter bird showed no interest in the newcomer and
after about two weeks I removed the unwanted one for its own protection,
leaving my "male" and the newcomer.
The two birds got on well together and the "male" was seen shivering its
wings and uttering a rasping noise which I had observed many times in the
past. On May 6th I thought the birds were mating but could not be certain,
as they moved apart on seeing me. I was reluctant to believe the evidence
of my own eyes, but it appeared that they were "the wrong way round" and
this was established without doubt some days later. The "male" was a
female, and the newcomer, a bird with a small head and generally feminine
appearance, was a male!
The hen spent long periods in the nest box, enticing the male inside on
occasions, until eventually he was feeding her inside the nest. On June 9th
two things happened: the hen laid her first egg and the male died suddenly.
So often in aviculture, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand: the male
looked unwell in the morning, moving only when the hen left the box. I felt
it was essential to catch him up so that he could have the benefit of an
infra-red lamp: this was done but, regretfully, he deteriorated very rapidly
and died within minutes. There is a strange parallel here with the only
other breeding attempt I know of which had occurred in Britain at that
time: in this instance the cock also died while the hen was incubating. After
the male's death, the hen gave me some cause for concern for I feared she
might not leave the nest to feed. She did not feed at all on the day following
the male's death so I placed a millet spray in the nest box and this was
eaten, so feeding her in this way became a daily ritual. Fortunately, the hen
was quite fearless and did not object to nest inspection: she sat very closely
and I could not see how many eggs she was incubating. When placing the
millet spray in the nest box on the morning of July 8th I saw two halves of
an eggshell. The following morning there were shells from two hatched
eggs in the box and later in the day I heard chicks cheeping. No more egg-
shells appeared. On one occasion I provoked the hen into moving slightly
(a liberty I would take with no other bird) and saw one pink-skinned chick
covered with fluff and this was to be my only glimpse of her offspring.
The squeaking of chicks was heard every day until July 17th. On the
morning of the 18th the body of one of the chicks was seen in the nest and
the next had died by the 20th. The hen refused to leave the nest box and I
had to remove the lid to cause her to desert. I then discovered that the
clutch had consisted of three eggs and removed the third; it contained a
fully formed chick. The presence of the third egg meant that the incubation
period is 27, possibly 29, days.
The death of the chicks was probably due to the fact that, without a
male to feed her, the hen was not leaving the nest frequently enough (as far
as I could tell, she fed only twice daily) and the chicks were not receiving

<bodyText confidence="0.999166822222222" page_id="56381818"  page_num="187" year="" vol="">
enough food. Perhaps the real cause, however, was that they were not receiv-
ing the correct diet. I offered corn-on-the-cob, greenfoods, various fruits
and even bread-and-butter pudding. However, the hen would eat nothing
but peanuts, a small amount of apple and sunflower seed. When the chicks
were three or four days old she refused to eat millet spray, soaked or dry.
In November of that year I obtained two more Bronze-winged Parrots
which were believed to be a true pair. The following year the proved hen
j was paired with the believed male but no nesting attempt occurred. That
winter the hen appeared to be ailing and was therefore housed in my indoor
: birdroom. Unfortunately, she died some months later, and the autopsy
revealed that her death was due to lymphatic leucosis (leukaemia) which,
apparently, rarely occurs in birds.
I w r as thus left with three Bronze-wings and I reunited the pair bought in
: November 1973. This pair nested in 1975 (see account in avicultural
magazine Jan-March 1976 p. 19). Briefly, three eggs were laid, two of
which hatched. One chick died when a few days old and the other was
i killed, almost certainly by the male, when 31 days old.
During January 1976 1 was surprised to see the male Bronze-wing coming
out of the nest box early one morning, for I had never previously seen him
; go inside. A less pleasant surprise was in store: he had attacked the hen
j whose head was bleeding; however, there was no permanent damage. I
; immediately removed the male to another aviary, and returned him after
five or six weeks. That incident strengthened my belief that it was the
: male who killed the youngster. The temperament of male Pionus in
i breeding condition can be treacherous, as I had discovered several years
previously with the Massena's.
The pair was reunited on February 15th and no further trouble
occurred. They are, unfortunately, housed in a very small aviary, originally
meant as temporary accommodation only, yet it apparently suits them.
They are rather nervous birds and the situation of the aviary, on the main
path, has steadied them to a slight degree.
In 1976 the Bronze-wings nested in May and on the 18th I noted in my
diary that the first egg might have been laid that day, as the hen was miss-
ing. Thirty one days later, on June 17th, a chick was heard but could, of
course, have hatched several days previously. Bronze-wing chicks have a
peculiar quavering cry, quite unlike any other parrot chick I have heard.
As was the case in the previous year, the hen was not seen in the flight until
more than four weeks after the chick was heard, i.e. I had not seen her for
two months, although towards the end of this period she was occasionally
seen to look out of the nest hole and the male would feed her from the
nest box perch.
When, on July 18th, she was seen sitting unconcernedly in the flight, we
feared the worst and my husband entered the aviary with the intention of
taking the nest box down. If the chick or chicks had again been mutilated,
inspection could do no harm and might be the means of saving them;

however, when my husband touched the nest box, the loud and angry
cries of a chick within assured us that all was well. We would certainly
have removed the young for hand-rearing if we had ever been able to
surprise the hen off the nest; this seemed to be impossible and we certainly
had no intention of tipping her out to remove the young. By the time she
came out of her own free will, the chicks were too old for hand-rearing so
we had no choice but to hope for the best. We were not too optimistic
because our new next-door neighbours' young children had a piece of
climbing apparatus a few feet from, and overlooking the Bronze-wings*
aviary, so the birds had every justification to destroy or mutilate their
chicks.
After July 18th the female spent increasingly long periods in the flight
and the male was occasionally seen to enter the nest. On August 5th a
young bird was seen at the entrance hole; thereafter it often looked out, at
first withdrawing its head on seeing us, but it soon became more confident.
Unfortunately, its head was almost bare of feathers; evidently one or both
of the parents were plucking it. At 7 pm on August 18th it left the nest; at
first it clung to the wire but it quickly learned to perch. Its underparts
were plucked bare but the plumage which remained was different from
that of the adults, the most noticeable feature being the green wings with a
few brown feathers on the wing coverts. The naked skin around the eye
was yellowish, that of the adults being red. When the underparts feathered,
they were navy blue, as in the adults.
On the following day I saw the female enter the nest and heard, to my
surprise, the sounds of another chick being fed. It was not seen to look out
of the nest until August 24th; it, too, had the head plucked naked and
when it fledged on August 26th we were dismayed to find that it was
badly crippled with rickets. It was quite unable to perch and spent its time
on the concrete floor of the aviary or climbing on the wire, using its beak
for support. The joints of its feet were badly swollen, and its parents seemed
as concerned at its condition as we were. Even its nest-mate would occasion-
ally fly down to it. Although the male and female continued to feed it, it
quickly learned to feed itself from food placed on the floor.
On the night of September 10th the weeks of drought ended with a
vengeance and although the entire aviary had been covered over, the
crippled youngster was found in a very wet condition the following
morning. It was taken indoors and placed near an infra-red lamp and
seemed to make good progress, being independent by then; however, it
died on September 17th and on autopsy it was found to be a female.
The elder youngster was first seen to feed itself on August 30th, although
it called for food occasionally for several weeks after that date. At the time
of writing (October 5th), its underparts have feathered but not the head;
possibly it is still being plucked. It is perfect in every other respect and less
timid than its parents. Following its example, the adults now eat corn-on-
the-cob, which they refused during the rearing period.

ROSEMARY LOW-BREEDING THE BRONZE-WINGED PARROT 1 89
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999079255813953" page_id="56381820"  page_num="189" year="" vol="">
A wide variety of foods were offered, the most favoured being celery,
carrot, Cheddar cheese, tomato and spray millet. The usual items of the
diet, apple, sunflower and canary seed, pine nuts and peanuts were also
eaten. Greenfood was seldom available, but lettuce was occasionally offered.
Because of an invasion of ants in the area of their aviary, sponge cake and
nectar, to which vitamins are normally added, were withheld.
I believe that this is the first occasion on which Bronze-winged Parrots
have successfully reared their young in the U.K. In 1973 one youngster
was bred by J. Stoodley of Hampshire: it was partly hand-reared and
partly reared by rosellas, after being attacked by one of its parents when
about 17 days old.
I am told that this species has also been bred in a European zoo--and
would greatly appreciate receiving details of this breeding.
As described, the Bronze-winged Parrot Pionus chalcopterus has been
bred by Mrs. Rosemary Grantham and this is believed to be the first
success in this country, but anyone knowing of a previous breeding of this
species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is asked to inform the Hon.
Secretary.
Mr. George Smith writes: The Swaenepoels had three pairs of Bronze-
winged Parrots housed together and one pair nested unsuccessfully in 1972.
Two of these, which were hoped to be the breeding pair, were kindly given
to me the following year. The others were also disposed of and it was a
pair of these which have since nested successfully in Belgium. In 1974 two
clutches were laid by my birds and incubation started; but, as the laying
bird always dives straight back into her nesting hole if I am lucky enough to
see her off feeding, and she is very ferocious in defence of her eggs, they
were never examined closely. That year I managed to weigh a fresh-laid
egg at 22 grams (it measured 32.6 x 37 mm) and this year another at 23
grams. The hen weighs 220 grams so these are quite huge eggs for a parrot
of this size. The interval between successive eggs has been three days and
the clutch was always three.
The only occasion when I have caught the birds on the ground is just
before egg-laying when the hen is searching for, what I take to be, old
faeces and soil for extra vitamins and minerals. The first egg that I weighed
was, in fact, found on the ground in the area where she had been seen so
often eating something. The birds only appear interested in the nest box
in the summer, although the hen may sometimes roost inside the box over
some winter nights.
Both sexes take an interest in the nest box although I believe that the hen
does most of the chewing. Even long before the eggs are laid the hen
shoots back if she catches sight of anyone approaching: the male, in
contrast, always forsakes the box when he hears someone. Even during the
incubation the male sleeps outside the box, but frequently enters it during

the day where he ultimately chewed the hen's head as bald as that of a
vulture. Judging from the noise of the freshly hatched chicks being fed, the
incubation period is 26 days. Unfortunately the male eats them within a
day of hatching: my one glimpse of a chick showed it to have long white
down, a bulbous bill and a sealed ear-hole.
The dark blue of the feathers is a wonderful camouflage. Very often
when looking directly into their small aviary it has taken some moments of
careful search before the Bronze-wings can be made out. The feather
colours so exactly match that of strong shadow that it makes them invisible
even in a near-bare aviary. The outermost ring of the iris is reddish-gold
and the inner light brown. The naked peri-orbital skin of my hen becomes
quite glaring red when she is breeding: that of the male is only slightly
more flushed than when not breeding. I cannot see any difference, other
than this (and the overgroomed head of the hen) between the two sexes.
Most of each head feather is white: this is not usually apparent because
of their grey-black tips. This is even more noticeable in the lovely puce of
the Plum-headed Parrot P. tumultuosus and (a subspecies?) the Hoary-
headed Parrot P. seniloides. In my experience Pionus parrots are not much
given to mutual preening except when breeding. They do sit close together
during the day although mine invariably roost separate. The head-preening,
once it starts, is rather vigorous, for it breaks off the dark grey tips to the
head feathers to leave huge white patches. It may be that this permanent
revelation of the underlying white serves to signal to the preening bird that it
is becoming too aggressive. If so these white bases to the feathers may serve
to inhibit aggression as does the hidden white nape-patch of broadtailed
parrots (England, M.D. 1945. avicultural magazine (5)4:63-64).

Lybius bidentatus
By M. D. England (Neatishead, Norfolk)
I imported my Double-toothed Barbets privately in May 1974, and they
quickly proved amenable by readily entering their shelter to feed and by
roosting indoors in the hollow log provided. I know no species of barbet
which, in the wild, does not roost in a hole, and I regard the provision of a
suitable roosting place--even if it be no more than a nest box--as an
important factor in keeping members of this family in contented good
health.
They proved to be somewhat tricky feeders in that, even more than
most other species of barbet, they have marked preference phases, for
some weeks eating little but grapes, then perhaps a period on diced apple
and tomato, followed by sultanas only. Mealworms seem to be their only
constant choice, even locusts being ignored at times. Just before and during
breeding they become more than ever insectivorous, on some days taking no
fruit at all. This particular pair sometimes gave cause for alarm by fasting
almost completely for more than a day at a time--nearly always in the
worst possible weather.
It was several months before I was certain that I had a true pair, although
they always agreed well together, because the only sound they made was
their rather hoarse sharp "chock" and they contented themselves with the
hole which I had provided without boring even a roosting hole, which so
often in the case of barbets is later used for breeding. They were difficult to
watch in their rather densely planted aviary and extraordinarily secretive
in their ways, disliking even to feed if they were aware of an onlooker.
When eventually they did rear families, I had to resort to sitting in a car at
the other side of the garden to watch their nesting behaviour with
binoculars.
I felt they must be a pair when I saw one feeding the other, but even
then they did not clearly show which was which because the food was often
passed back and forth between them before finally being swallowed.
However, one began to utter a rolling guttural low-pitched sound reminis-
cent of a person gargling for a sore throat, and I took this to be the male.
They bored a hole near the top (about 7 ft. from the ground) of an alder
log which would have been too tough for smaller species and this was
evidently deep--perhaps 20 inches or more--because one could hear a
considerable amount of scrabbling upwards when a sitting bird was re-
lieved by its mate or disturbed. The entrance hole made by a Double-
toothed Barbet is quite unlike the usual barbets' beautifully neat and
symmetrical circle, being ragged and of no particular shape (three borings
observed).

M. D. ENGLAND--BREEDING THE DOUBLE-TOOTHED BARBET
Their secretive ways, the depth of the hole and the fact that most barbets
spend a lot of time in the "nest" before egg-laying made it impossible to be
certain of either the incubation or fledging periods, although the former
was probably about 20 days and the young spent at least four weeks in the
hole. Both parents took their share of incubation and feeding, the latter
being done by what one might call "semi-regurgitation"; that is to say the
food was not visible in the bill when carried to the nest but was taken there
soon enough after being picked up by the parent (and apparently swallowed)
for there to have been little time for any digestive process to have taken
place.
I spent long periods in the car watching feeding operations and during the
period September 2nd to 4th, food was taken into the hole at intervals of an
average of 19 minutes at mid-morning and late afternoon. At many of these
feeds both parents arrived at once, one waiting outside the hole until the
other emerged after feeding; the figure of 19 minutes therefore gives only a
rough guide as to the frequency of feeding. For the last few days before
leaving the nest the youngster appeared at the entrance hole, often spend-
ing a long time there waiting and watching. Curiously enough, it was
seldom seen to be fed at the entrance, the parents appearing to prefer to
choose periods when the hole was clear and they could go right in.
Fledglings only differ from their parents in plumage by having the breast
and belly dark in colour, the bright red appearing gradually and still not
being so extensive nor so bright as an adult's at six months old. Like most
young barbets, they are very strong on the wing within a day or two of
leaving the nest. The only call which I heard them make was a weak,
rasping form of the adult "chock." Although very quickly able to feed
themselves, they seem to rely on their parents, at least to some extent, for
several weeks after fledging. They have the confusing habit of returning to
the nest (and appearing at the hole to be fed) for several days after first
leaving it. Since incubation begins with the first egg, chicks are of different
ages and this, coupled with a rather densely planted aviary and their habit
of returning to the nest, made it extraordinarily difficult to be sure how
many young there were. In the case of one of their three broods this was
the cause of my failing to spot the fact that a fledged youngster was being
neglected by the parents, who were concentrating on rearing an older,
stronger chick, and this one, unfortunately, now resides in the British
Museum (Natural History) at Tring.
In 1975 the only chick to survive the initial hazards was found drowned
after a thunderstorm, despite the fact that it was not unfamiliar with the
shelter and there was also plenty of growing cover in the flight. I had
previously lost an adult male Gaudy Barbet Megalaima mystacophanes in
the same way, and had found this mystifying since birds, which must be
used to tropical rain in their natural habitat, must also have found a way to
survive it. I was interested to watch, in April 1976 in Tobago, a Blue-
crowned Motmot behaving in a way which gave a probable solution. This

bird was coming to a kitchen window to take pieces of cheese from my
fingers when a very violent rainstorm started. Instead of remaining under
cover, the bird flew out to a completely open branch and deliberately
allowed itself to become so soaked that it could not fly. As so often happens
in the tropics (except at the height of the rainy season), after a few moments
scorching sun replaced the rain. The motmot spread its wings and tail,
turning slowly this way and that until it was dry enough to begin preening,
staying on the one perch in the sun for a considerable time and allowing me
to take many photographs. No doubt my barbets had tried to adopt the
same procedure but without the help of sunshine and probably in continu-
ing rain, until cold and still waterlogged, they fell to the ground.
By the beginning of April 1976 the parent Double-toothed Barbets were
hard at it again but, because of the long and drawn-out incubation and
fledging periods it was not until June 10th that a youngster was seen at the
hole, and it did not leave it for the first time until 16th. Even then it
returned for most of 17th, was out again all day on 18th and was returning
only to roost by the next day. Meanwhile a second chick was appearing at
the hole and it became difficult to tell, without searching the bushes, just
which of the two was where.
In the event only one youngster out of the three reared in 1975 and 1976
still survives, and it has now been given an unrelated mate.
As recorded above, the Double-toothed Barbet Lybius bidentatus has been
bred by Mr. M. D. England and this is believed to be the first success in this
country. Anyone knowing of a previous breeding in Great Britain or
Northern Ireland is asked to inform the Hon. Secretary.

By Jonathan Smith (Slimbridge, Glos.)
This story begins in mid-June 1975 when I received a four weeks-old
Tawny Owl Strix aluco from the local postman, who had picked it up at the
side of the road. Unable to find its nest hole in the vicinity, I decided to try
and rear the owl myself.
For two months Strix, as I named him, had the complete run of my
room, conveniently sleeping during the day while I was working, but
becoming very active in the evenings and at dawn. He had a habit of
waking me at four every morning by sitting on my head and squeaking in my
ear to be fed! Feeding him, however, proved to be no problem. He took
very quickly to training and soon learned to go through the motions of
making his own 'kills'. This was achieved by attaching a piece of string to
the leg of a freshly killed mouse or vole, and dragging it enticingly across the
floor. Strix would bob excitedly from side to side, shuffling into position on
his perch as he seemed to calculate the distance, and then quite suddenly he
would swoop down on silent wings and, with a loud thud, pin the mouse to
the ground. On average he consumed about three mice a day.
Strix soon settled into his large aviary which measured 18 feet x 9 feet x
8 feet and, fortunately, lost most of his tameness. From his small size, I
was convinced that he was a male, since females, as in the case of most
other raptors, tend to be the larger sex. In late March 1976 ,1 obtained a
five-year-old female from a wildlife park in Bristol, where she had lived in a
large, but overcrowded, aviary. She was completely different from Strix in
character and colour and was of the grey phase, Strix being of the more
usual tawny or rufous-coloured phase.
I had put up a nest box (chimney type) in the corner of the aviary 'just in
case', but really believed that nothing would happen, at least until the
following year. However, the female soon took to roosting in the nest box
during the day and when she failed to come out one evening, I put my
hand underneath her and, to my great surprise, felt an egg! A second egg
appeared three days later, on May 1st. From then on, the female was seen
only rarely outside the box, whilst Strix indicated he was indeed her true
mate by showing new and aggressive tendencies towards me, pouncing
occasionally on my head when I entered the aviary. He had never done
that before! He would also take the first vole he was given to the sitting
female and would join her in the nest box--a very cosy situation as the
bottom of the box was only 8 inches x 8.
On May 9th I 'candled' the eggs by holding them against a shaded light
bulb and saw that both were fertile and developing well. Thus it showed
Strix was an able, mature male at under one year old. I weighed and meas-
ured the two eggs and found that they were very similar to the average for
100 eggs measured in the wild--46.69 x 39.06 mm. (Witherby etal 1940)

one measuring 48.7 x 38.6 mm. and the other 49.75 x 39.2 mm.
By May 28th, I found that the first egg had hatched; however, it is pos-
sible that it had done so a few days earlier, since the interval between the
actual laying of the eggs can be from 48 hours to a week (Witherby loc. cit.),
and so the gap between the hatchings might also be spaced, as the female,
like most owls, starts to incubate the eggs as soon as they are laid. For this
reason there can be great differences in size and development between the
youngest and the eldest owlet. The next day, May 29th, the other egg had
hatched.
Observation of the owlets 9 development was made through a small
side door about five inches from the bottom of the nest box. At first the
young were hardly recognisable as owls, and were remarkably helpless.
They had at this stage a thin covering of white down beneath which their
pink skin was clearly visible. Their eyes were closed (and remained so for at
least another six days) but their head, bill and feet seemed abnormally
large compared to the rest of their bodies. The small white 'chipping 9
tooth was discernible on the tip of the top mandible. It was obvious initi-
ally that one of the owlets was larger than the other, but a plentiful supply
of food enabled the smaller to 'catch up 9 , until at 16 days there appeared to
be little difference between them.
At this age the parent female spent much less time in the nest box and
during this period I often observed some unusual and intimate behaviour
between the adults. When I put some voles on the aviary floor, Strix
having efficiently picked one up, would fly to the female and would offer
the vole to her by passing it from bill to bill. This was often followed by
Strix nibbling ardently at the female's breast and neck feathers. However,
more often than not, the female seemed uninspired by his attentions and
would soon leave him to flop down in the bottom of the box to feed the
young.
At 24 days old, June 20th, the owlets were able to stand up on their feet
instead of sitting back on their haunches. Together they filled the bottom
of the nest box, especially when they puffed out their feathers and con-
tinuously snapped their bills loudly in an attempt to frighten me away.
At 30 days the larger of the two young had made the big ascent to the top
of the nest box and could be seen at the entrance observing the outside
world for the first time. There was already a notable difference between the
two youngsters in the colour of the plumage developing below the thick
covering of buff-coloured down. The slightly larger owlet was becoming
like the female--a grey phase--while the smaller was tawny-brown like
Strix. Even the shape of their heads indicated the difference in their
parents. Strix's head is very round and slightly flat-topped, while the
female's has a definite rounded point. These characteristics can also be
seen in the young.
By feeding the owls late in the evening, I could observe the parents going
about their business, taking mice to feed the young who would continu-

ously utter rasping squeaks to let the adults know exactly what they
needed! The female did not hesitate to take the first two mice to her young.
Occasionally she would decapitate the larger voles first and then pass the
rest to an owlet, who, with a few hard gulps swallowed the remainder with
relative ease. Sometimes, just the tail of a mouse continued for a moment to
protrude from the owlet's bill, until that also slipped out of sight. By June
29th, when the young were 33 days old, both had made some successful
attempts at flying and from then on they could be seen on any of the perches
in the aviary.
I would not have believed that the saving of a young downy owl from
almost certain death under the wheels of a car could have resulted, a year
later, in the rearing of another two balls of down from that same small bird.

By A. J. Mobbs (Walsall, West Midlands)
The Purple-throated Carib can be found throughout most of, but is
virtually restricted to, the Lesser Antilles (Bond 1971). It is a large hum-
mingbird with an overall length of approximately 5 inches. Overall body
colour is black (purple-black in certain lights), with a large patch from
chin to lower throat iridescent purple-red. Tail and upper and under tail-
coverts are iridescent bluish-green. The wings (including the primaries)
are iridescent green. Sexes are similar, but females are slightly smaller than
males (males average 9-9g; females 7.9g (Wolf 1975)); also females are
more round-bodied than males and their beaks are longer and more de-
curved. Females do not appear to be so brightly coloured as the males, this
being especially noticeable on the wings, tail and upper and under
tail-coverts.
It will be noticed I have described the iridescent areas as such and not as
"glittering". This is because the iridescent plumage of this species is unlike
any other I have come across. Special mention must be made of the iri-
descent primaries; only one other hummingbird species having this
peculiarity, namely the Great Sapphirewing Pterophanes cyanopterus.
The Purple-throated Carib has not been brought into Europe commer-
cially and but for the generosity of the late Guy Detry (Wavre, Belgium), I
would be unable to write on the species from personal experience. M.
Detry while on holiday in the West Indies during the autumn of 1972,
trapped, under licence, a number of caribs of both sexes. A month after his

return, he kindly presented me with a female. The following year, he again
trapped Eulampis and upon returning home, presented me with an
outstanding male.
When I received the female, she was in rather poor feather due to being
; taken with bird-lime; she also had crossed mandibles and an abscess on the
&apos; upper mandible. It is relatively simple to rectify crossed mandibles in a
hummingbird which requires the beak trimming periodically. However,
Eulampis does not come under this category and because of this it was
some months before the mandibles grew in correctly even though I pared
away a certain amount of the crossed portion every week or so. Since the
bill has regained its correct shape, it has not required trimming and the
j beak of the male has never required trimming.
The abscess on the female&apos;s upper mandible was caused through pressure
being applied when the bird fed from a feeder with a narrow spout. All of
my feeding tubes have short and fairly wide spouts and because of this, the
pressure ceased and the abscess sloughed off very quickly: however, it was
some months before the scar finally disappeared.
It has always been my policy to provide hummingbirds with bathing
facilities and to rarely, if ever, spray them. By the time the female carib
came to me, she had learnt to expect to be sprayed regularly each day,
rather than bathe from a receptacle and try as I may I have been unable to
persuade her to bathe even though she is housed with ten other humming-
birds which all use regularly the saucers of water provided. Because of the
female carib&apos;s complete refusal to even attempt to bathe, I have to spray her
daily. She has learnt that when the bathing receptacles are taken from the
light for washing and refilling, she will receive her daily spray shortly
afterwards. At such times she becomes most excited and will, if the oppor-
tunity arises, leave the flight and follow either my wife or I around the
birdroom until one of us reaches for the hand-spray, when she will
immediately return to the flight, alight on her favourite perch and fluff the
\0x25A0 body feathers and hold the wings out ready to catch the droplets of water.
Of all the hummingbirds I have owned over the years, the female carib is
the first which has completely refused to even attempt to bathe from a
saucer of water. Ruby-topaz, Chrysolampis mosquitus, are notorious for their
: aversion to water, yet even these can usually be persuaded to at least alight
on a bathing receptacle and dip the head and breast into the water.
The male carib was caged soon after capture and because of this, learnt to
I bathe in a saucer of water from the very beginning.
Other than the harsh rasping call used during acts of aggression (see
&apos; later), the female carib was not heard to make a sound during the first 13
months she was with me, yet within seconds of the male being brought into
my birdroom, the two birds were calling incessantly to each other. The
male had been brought over from the Continent by a mutual friend of the
late Guy Derry and I. Because of the stress experienced, I thought it
preferable to cage the male carib for a couple of days. On the third day, the

bird was released into my communal hummingbird flight. Immediately
the female saw the male, she went into display (a) (see later).
After completing its second moult in captivity (16 months after coming
into my possession), the male carib became extremely aggressive not only
to the female, but to other hummingbirds with which it was housed.
Because of this, I was forced to remove the male from the flight and cage it
permanently. I have attempted to re-introduce the male into the flight on
several occasions, but after only a matter of hours, the carib has once
again become extremely aggressive. It is sometimes possible, during the
annual moult, to re-introduce an aggressive species into a communal flight
of hummingbirds. Not so the male carib, as even when in very heavy
moult, it began to show extreme aggression within a couple of days of
being released into the flight.
Although caged, the male has continued to display; however, stages
(a) and (b) have been the only procedures used; stage (c) not being used for
obvious reasons (see later). When in full breeding condition, the bird has
been heard to sing; however, it has become less vocal since being caged.

Mating display

The mating display observed by me in Eulampis can be divided into certain
stages. Although Wolf (1975) states that this behaviour is usually performed
sequentially, I have not found this to be so with captive birds. The display
procedures most often used are as follows:
a) (performed by both sexes) The plumage is held tightly against the body,
the wings although unopened, are held away from the body at an angle of
45 degrees. The bird then moves the body rapidly from side to side.
During these movements, the head and body may be held in a horizontal
position or at any angle up to 72 degrees, according to where the display is
being directed; i.e. should a bird to which the display is being directed be
perched higher than the carib, then the head and body will be held almost
erect; should the perched bird be at the same height or less, then the carib
holds the body in a horizontal position.
When a displaying Eulampis holds the head and body at an angle of 72
degrees, the colour of the throat patch can be readily seen. However, should
the bird be viewed from beneath, the colour cannot be seen and the carib
appears all-black. It appears therefore that the described stance is not
taken up solely to display coloration.
b) (performed by male only) The carib, using exaggerated wing movements,
flies from perch to perch; i.e. the wings are moved more slowly than in
normal flight and a cracking sound like that of a whip can be heard. The
body feathers are fluffed out and the bird holds itself erect throughout.
After moving from perch to perch a number of times (average 4), the
carib, while perched, will go through the actions of mating. During this
procedure the bird leans backwards bringing the vent area and the tail
well under the perch; the head is held slightly backward and to one side.

During the described procedure, the wings are held open and moved so as
to enable the bird to maintain its balance. I can only presume that these
actions are for a (false) ventral mating (see Wolf 1975). Throughout the
described procedure, the bird can be heard to utter a low churring note,
c) (performed by both sexes) The bird hovers either directly in front or
slightly below a perched Eulampis. The tail is fanned and depressed and the
head is raised slightly thus highlighting the iridescent throat feathers.
; Should the hovering bird be male, the female may ignore him, when he will
) then either attack her, forcing her to leave the perch, or cease to display and
1 alight nearby and commence displacement preening. On rare occasions the
\ female will leave the perch and, taking up the same stance as the displaying
male, hover directly in front of him. This combined aerial display may last
for 30 seconds, rarely longer, after which the birds alight on a perch and
I commence to preen.
Should the hovering bird be female, the perched male will usually carry
out the actions described in stage (a), after which he will leave the perch
and either chase the female, or carry out the aerial display already described.
During the aerial display both birds utter loud call-notes.
At certain times of the year when only the female is in breeding condition,
she will perform in front of the perched male. However, this display is
always totally ignored by the male and after a few moments the female
returns to a perch and commences to preen.
None of the display stages described are performed to anything other

than another Eulampis. I have, on occasions seen the male begin stage (a)
when a hummingbird has alighted nearby, but the former has ceased to
display after a second or so (certainly no longer),

Aggressive behaviour

<bodyText confidence="0.981473470588235" page_id="56381834"  page_num="199" year="" vol="">
Unlike other species of hummingbirds which I have studied, I have not
found the aggressive behaviour of Eulampis to revert to mating display if a
willing partner has been found. Although Wolf and Wolf (1971) suggest
that the 'arcing 5 flight described by them (see later) could with a further
deepening of the 'arc 5 become similar to the dive display of the Anna
Hummingbird Calypte anna; they do not go so far as to suggest the display
could become sexual rather than aggressive.
The aggressive behaviour I have witnessed is as follows:
a) The carib (either sex) moves back and forth either in front or slightly
above the bird to which aggression is being directed. At such times the
tail feathers may be fanned and usually the carib utters a harsh rasping
call-note. Should it be the female carib which is displaying and should she
fail to rout the bird to which aggression is being shown, she usually ceases
to show aggression, alights on a nearby perch and commences to preen.
However, should it be the male carib showing aggression, he does not give
up so easily and more often than not succeeds in routing the bird to which
aggression is being directed.

It is interesting to note (see earlier) that other than uttering the harsh
rasping note used by both sexes when showing aggression, the female
carib was silent up until the time when the male was brought into my bird-
room. At first the male was housed in a cage; even so within a matter of
seconds of it beginning to call, it was being answered by the female. This
calling was kept up almost incessantly until the male was released into my
communal hummingbird flight, whereupon the female went immediately
into display sequence (a).
I have mentioned earlier the harsh rasping call given by Eulampis
when showing aggression; also the soft calls made by the male when going
through the actions of mating. Although I can find no record of male
Eulampis being attributed with a song, I am certain that the series of notes
which on occasions are uttered by the male in my collection, can be classed
as such. These vocalisations are little more than single notes run together;
nevertheless a distinct pattern can be determined. This song appears to be
used only at certain times of the year, mainly just after the moulting period
when the bird is at its fittest (sexually). Females do not appear to have a
song.

From observations made on the pair of Eulampis in my collection, and
from the exchange of correspondence with other enthusiasts who also own
this species, it appears that Eulampis is one of the few hummingbird
species (in fact maybe the only one?) which perform the mating display
solely to one of their own kind. All other hummingbird species I have
studied have, if a member of the same species has not been available,
directed their mating display to other hummingbirds with which they were
housed. Admittedly such displays have usually been directed towards a
species similar to the displaying bird; however, this has not always been the
case.
There are a number of records of hybrids being taken in the wild, perhaps
one of the most notable being the progeny from a mating between Lesbia
victoriae (Black-tailed Trainbearer) and Ramphomicron microrhynchum
(Purple-backed Thornbill) (de Schauensee 1966) (see also Mannering
1964, plate 21). However, as unusual as such a mating may appear, if one
has seen the display of the species concerned (see Mobbs 1970 and 1971),
and noted that females of both species are superficially alike, such a mating
need not seem as unusual as it would first appear.
It is possible that, as the sexes in Eulampis are very much alike and as
there is no other species remotely like it, the mating display in this species
can be triggered off only by another Eulampis.
As mentioned earlier, the male carib has on occasions, performed part of
the mating display when another hummingbird has alighted nearby.
However, for this to occur, the latter has to be a dark coloured species;

otherwise there is no reaction from the carib.
Wolf (1975) describes in detail, a form of soliciting by a female Eulampis
in the wild. It appears to obtain food from a male's territory; a female was
seen to encourage the former to mate with her (out of the breeding season),
solely to enable her to sip nectar from flowers in its territory. Due to the
abundance of food always available, captive female Eulampis have no reason
to solicit; nevertheless, as can be seen from my observations, females will
1 display to a male, even when the need for food is not the stimulant.
Although further study is required before definite conclusions can be
: reached, I feel there is a possibility that with certain hummingbird species
; in which the sexes are monomorphic in colour, both male and female per-
form mating displays and, what is perhaps more important, females can
instigate the display.
The Purple-throated Carib is without doubt one of the most robust of
the Trochilidae I have owned. Being extremely beautiful, easily cared for
: and suited to life in a cage, aviary or indoor flight, the species would no
doubt be a most popular one with aviculturists were it available commer-
: dally. It appears that the species is also extremely long-lived in captivity,
the New York Zoological Park having kept a female alive for 10 years,
8 months and 6 days (Schuchmann 1972; see also Conway 1962).
Although my pair have come into full breeding condition each year, the
female has never attempted to go to nest. I find this somewhat surprising as
most female hummingbirds (even those of the more delicate species) once
established, at least attempt to go to nest. Were I not so limited for room
(living in a flat does limit one's birdkeeping activities), I would give the
caribs a flight to themselves. I feel certain such birds would prove suitable
for housing in an aviary all the year round if a heated shelter were provided
during the colder months.

Amazona leucocephala hesterna
By Ramon Noegel (Seffner, Florida, U.S.A.)
About 150 miles south to south-west of central Cuba, in the clear waters
of the Caribbean, there are two mountain tops that rise just above sea-
level. These tiny islands are Little Cayman and Cayman Brae and the sea
about them drops off to a depth of three to four thousand metres. As the
waters receded or the floor of the ocean rose, these two mountain tops
became dry enough for vegetation to form on them and today they are
rather unusual as Caribbean islands go---not at all what one would picture in
a tourist guide: they have often been referred to as the islands time passed
by.
It has only been in the last decade that any tourism has come to these
two lesser of the three islands that comprise the Caymans. Grand Cayman,
the largest of the three, is located approximately 90 miles south-west of the
lesser two. Since the advent of an airfield on Grand Cayman in 1954, this
island has become a Mecca for divers and sportsmen who wish to try their
luck with the many fishes that abound in these waters. To the diver the
visibility and beauty of the coral reefs are enough to warrant a trip half-way
around the world and many do go that far: others go to enjoy the beautiful
beaches. Now, however, changes are taking place and soon these isles will
be so tourist orientated that one might just as well visit Miami Beach or the
Bahamas.
My interest was not in the emerald waters and excellent climate, but
rather in the rare Cayman Brae Amazon Parrot. This subspecies inhabits
the smallest land mass of any of the Amazons, for Cayman Brae covers less
than 20 square miles. There are no parrots on Little Cayman which is
separated from Cayman Brae by only seven miles of sea. After chartering a
small plane from Cayman Brae and landing on a field used as an air strip,
Patsy and Clarke Carraway and I spent some of the hottest and most un-
comfortable days imaginable there, and we can say with authority there
are no specimens of A. 1 . hesterna on Little Cayman.
None of its 18 inhabitants could ever remember seeing any parrots there.
In the early part of this century there was phosphate mining on Little
Cayman and as a result the centre of the island has been lowered to the
extent that the greater part of it is now a salt marsh. Only along the coast-
line are there suitable trees for parrots to nest in or from which to obtain
food and there just are not enough of such trees to support a colony of the
parrots: also the island, being so low, has often in recent times been covered
by the sea during hurricanes. A 1932 storm even swept away the last
crocodile which was found a few days later at Spot Bay on the east end of
Cayman Brae. The local people found it near a fishing hole near the beach
and killed it. These islands derived their name from the Caribe Indian

word Caymanas, meaning crocodile, but there are none left on Little
Cayman. Cayman Brae, being ten miles long and two wide differs from
Little Cayman in having a rock bluff roughly 150 feet high at the eastern
end and gradually slopes to sea-level at the western end. Though Little
Cayman has a low bluff about 20 feet in height, it is confined for the most
part to the coastal area. Most of the 1200 inhabitants of Cayman Brae live in
the coastal area of the northern side, for the south side is bleak, dry and
suffers the worst of the southern winds; also there are no wells on the
south side due to the area not being high enough and far enough from the
sea to make fresh water wells possible.
The top of the bluff is relatively flat, though rough and jagged with
rocks: here there is a thick growth of trees, cacti and orchids. The only
entrance is by footpaths difficult for the uninitiated to traverse, for it is
easy to slip into one of the many fissures in the rock and thus sustain
injury. This rugged area is the habitat of the Cayman Brae Amazon, but
these parrots may often leave the bluff to visit the local people's gardens and
fruit trees, but always return to the safety of the bluff to roost. The local
people clear small areas atop the bluff in order to grow papayas, bananas,
cassava, sweet potatoes, mangos and beans, and it is in these small clearings,
reached only by a steep climb and the footpaths that one might see the
parrots in any numbers, for here they feast on the fruit of the gardeners'
labour. It was in such a plantation that we were able to see 28 of these
lovely birds busily working over papaya fruit and alighting on the ground to
feed off some seed-bearing plants. Hanging by the stems of the papaya
leaves, these parrots cut a hole in the ripened fruit just large enough to
admit the head and by this opening completely clean out the black seeds and
most of the flesh of the fruit. At this time the white crowns and red cheeks
and throats are so covered with the stain from the fruit that the birds in no
way resemble their usual selves. They have no aversion to eating into the
green fruits if no ripe ones are present and when the mangos begin to
ripen in April, the same performance is repeated, but green fruits are
often partly eaten and dropped in a most wasteful manner, so that a whole
tree of mangos may be stripped in two days by a dozen of the parrots.
Fortunately for them the people do not seem to care and take it all in their
stride as they do most other matters and their attitude toward the parrots is
one of indifference.
The nesting season begins in April and thereby coincides with that of
the Grand Cayman subspecies A.l.caymanensis as well as that of the Cuban
race. Usually a "cedar" tree is selected, though not a true cedar as we know
it, but the wood has the aroma of the true cedar. The opening in such trees
is often high up, but the actual hollow may extend down into the trunk
from a branch so that the nest itself may be almost at ground level. It was
from such a tree that Mr Kendall Ryan took two chicks in 1972 and I
purchased them from him in December 1974. He told me that he was
drawn to the tree by the noise made by the young birds and he cut his way

from the uppermost branch where the entrance was only to discover that
the nest was near the ground and it was so small a cavity that he could only
extricate the two chicks by means of a stick. Other trees used by the parrots
for nesting are the mahogany and the "birch 55 whenever a suitable hollow
can be found in them. The "cedar 55 , however, appears to have a natural
tendency to be hollow even in its branches and it thereby provides better
nesting accommodation for these parrots.
Judging from the four trips I have made to Cayman Brae and the three
months spent there by Patsy and Clarke Carraway, who I sent there to
study these Amazons, there seems to be one large flock of them, numbering
about 30 to 40 that forage from one end of the island to the other. We con-
cluded that this movement takes about three to four weeks to complete and
then they begin working their way back in the opposite direction. As a
result of this constant movement, one may never see a large flock unless
informed of their whereabouts. Since no one on the island pays any atten-
tion to them, it was by sheer accident that we stumbled on this occurrence.
Once observed, we could predict where the flock would be: thereby we
would simply follow their movements on a daily basis which necessitated
rising before dawn (about 4.30 a.m.) and scaling the bluff to the next
plantation in their pathway and we were usually rewarded.
If we failed to intercept them we knew that tomorrow they would prob-
ably be there: however, we almost always managed to see a pair or two that
had left the flock and were preparing to nest on their own. As well as I
could tell, this large flock seems to have been mostly of young of three
years old and under. On several occasions we noticed an adult pair with
two or three young still with them from last year's nest. Our time of
observation covered from the end of December 1974 t0 May x 975 *
Only after the first year do the young make their drastic change in
colour from a drab green body, dull red cheeks and a dirty grey forehead to
the striking vivid colours of the adults. The transformation is the most
pronounced I recall seeing among any Amazons I have had as juveniles
passing their first year. Even the four Grand Cayman Amazons we hatched
here and hand-raised in 1974 feathered out in almost adult plumage and
even though they have increased in vividness since their first year, it was
nothing to compare with the young one I purchased on Cayman Brae in
December of 1974, which would have made it about eight months old at
the time.
Since previous descriptions of hesterna have been rather misleading and
were no doubt based on skins rather than live birds of various ages, I
think it wise to give a comparison between it and A. 1 . leucocephala of
Cuba, the latter being familiar to many of the older generation of avicul-
turists.
The Cayman Brae Amazon is smaller than the Cuban and considerably
smaller than its stockier relative the Grand Cayman subspecies, thus
making it the smallest of this species group. There are several differences

that set it apart, although they may appear slight to the casual observer. The
head is narrow in proportion to the broad head of the Cuban, and this is
especially true in the hens whose overall size is smaller than the cocks'; also,
the white of the head is generally confined to the forehead, making them
easy to sight-sex in the wild. The culmen is large in proportion to the
bird's body and extends from the head in a manner so as to resemble the
beak of the Canary-winged Parrakeet. The two mandibles seem never to
completely close so that one gets the impression that the lower mandible
needs trimming. In the cocks the larger head and beak give the bird a
slightly top heavy appearance: the tail is short.
The basic colour of this parrot is almost that of the nominate race with
these exceptions: the vinaceous on the belly is more of a mauve which, in
most specimens, extends up onto the breast and is "solid", thereby giving
an apron appearance. These feathers are heavily accented with black
edging which sets them off even more. In all the Cubans I have seen to
date there has been a wedge shape of green feathers extending from the
breast into the vinaceous, causing a jagged displacement of this colouring.
Where this parrot gains in its belly colouring it loses with regard to the
extent of the pink or scarlet on its head which in most specimens, especially
the hens, is confined to the cheeks extending back to the black ear-coverts
and with just a touch on the chin right under the beak. Those specimens
that have any of this colouring on their throats usually have it modified by a
cut in of green feathers which remains in adulthood, whereas in the Cuban
this collar gradually disappears with age.
While I have seen, in the wild, specimens with as much red on them as
any Cuban, they are indeed rare and so pronounced that they were readily
distinguishable from the flock they were in. The two oldest specimens we
have, both taken from the same nest, have extensive red on the throat and
cheeks with a cut in of green feathers that separates the chin and throat
with the exception of a line of red running down directly under the beak.
These are exceptions and some of the Brae people, when seeing these ex-
ceptions, have thought they were strays from Cuba, but I assured them they
were not, it being next to impossible for any parrot not borne by a storm
to have flown the distance between Cuba and the Brae. The small size of
these individuals would also preclude them being Cuban specimens, but
these exceptions would seem to indicate a stronger link with the nominate
race than in the case of A. L caymanensis that seems to differ the most from
it.
The eye ring is white or bluish and, while it is small, it is more pro-
nounced than in the Grand Cayman Parrot and, like the Cuban, has an
accompaniment of white feather edging around it. The green or basic
colour is light to dark, depending on the specimen, with heavy black
edging. The hens in general have, due to the smaller size of the head and
neck feathers, a proportionately heavier edging of this black, thus giving
them a darker appearance than most cocks. As a result the hens appear to

have a black mantilla (head covering) that follows the white on the crown
and extends down over the ear-coverts, causing the head and back of the
neck to be dark in contrast to the lighter appearance of the green back and
tail. The primaries have the outer webs coloured with a beautiful shade of
blue, the inner webs being black. The rectrices have the same shades of
red, orange and yellow splashes on them, concealed by the tail-coverts, as
the Cubans have and the two outer tail feathers have only a faint bluish
tinge on the outer webs, whereas in the Cuban it is pronounced.
It is interesting to note the change that comes to these parrots after their
first year is completed. The one I purchased on the island in December
1974 was 80 drab I was doubtful whether it was a native specimen. It had
a dirty grey forehead, no more than a line above the culmen, dark maroon
cheeks and a dull green overall colour, with only a trace of dull red on its
belly. By the fall of 1975, however, it had turned into as beautifully coloured
a specimen as any adult we saw and the mauve has completely covered the
belly and lower portion of the breast.
The general changing of colours in the adult birds no doubt accounts for
so many varied descriptions on record, for in the spring the cheeks are a
bright scarlet; as summer approaches this may fade to almost orange and
finally in the fall to rosy pink. This shade of pink is more discernible in the
hens, the cocks tending toward a bright crimson. The forehead and crown
are pure white, as the Cuban, with an occasional few pink, yellow or orange
feathers among the white but in general specimens exhibit pure white
crowns and foreheads.
The personality of this parrot differs considerably from others of the
genus and from its near relatives in that even adults captured in the wild
will readily tame. The close proximity with which they have been associated
with people no doubt accounts for this. Those we saw that frequented
fruit trees seemed totally to ignore the people who were often right under
such trees.
Some of the island lore with regard to hesterna. might be of interest. The
islanders believe that only parrots with black tongues make good talkers
and that the Grand Cayman Parrot is a better talker than the Brae Amazon.
If you wish to get close enough to noose a parrot in a tree you have to re-
move all your clothing, as the bird fears the clothing and not the man.
Patsy and Clarke Carraway disproved this last belief and were only rewar-
ded with numerous mosquito bites. To my surprise some of the Brae people
were not even aware that a native parrot was on their island although all
these folk had been born and reared on the Brae: this again shows the lack
of interest in the natural fauna.
Due to the islanders' belief in the talking ability of the Grand Cayman
subspecies, there were about eight of these parrots kept as pets by different
people, and I might say often kept at liberty which makes their escape and
interbreeding with the local Amazon a possibility. Other parrots kept as
pets there were, as I recall, one Yellow-billed Amazon, three Yellow-

naped Amazons, two Scarlet Macaws, six conures and about five of the
Brae Amazon. The people, being extremely friendly and willing not only to
talk about parrots but often to take you to a friend's house in order to see
their bird, it was easy to locate the pet parrots on the island.
While we were there a giant project was in progress; that of putting the
first real road across the bluff in the centre of the island to connect the
south side with the north: at present it can be reached only by going to the
west end and then along a dirt road on the south coast. The intention after
this project was to run a road in the centre of the bluff from this cross
road, thereby opening up the bluff for homes to be built. Such an invasion
of the parrots' habitat will, I fear, be disastrous. There is a threat of the
Brae becoming more of a tourist attraction; also future plans to put an oil
refinery on Little Cayman which will bring many outsiders to the Brae.
I had the New Age Assembly Church sponsor Patsy and Clarke Carraway
to spend three months on the island to learn as much as they could about
the habits, nesting and foods of this Amazon and to bring home two pairs of
them in addition to the brother-sister pair I already had. All these birds
would be kept here in Central Florida at the Church-owned New Age
Ranch in the hope of captive breeding, which we have been successful in
doing with the Grand Cayman subspecies.
Having already obtained one young Brae Amazon, we set out to trap
three more. All efforts proved futile, for regardless of this Amazon's tame-
ness we could neither trap nor noose any. Unexpected aid came from an
article printed in "The Bluff", a monthly news letter, which was entitled
"The Parrot People". This article explained the reason for Patsy and
Clarke's quest of parrots and the reason we wished to obtain them. With
this added help we soon were able to purchase three young specimens from
the local children who knocked them out of trees with rocks. Fortunately,
none was seriously hurt, apparently being stunned or shocked, rather than
injured. Few were ever taken from nests, as in Grand Cayman.
With this added publicity some of the more influential citizenry, some of
whom live in the States as well as having homes on the island, came for-
ward and offered assistance because they shared with us the concern for
the plight of the island's wildlife. Without their influence we would no
doubt have not been allowed to bring the parrots back, for more and more
often the officials at Grand Cayman Airport are taking parrots from those
wishing to leave with them, for fear they would be confiscated on arrival in
the U.S. and put to death. A wise decision, but without a captive breeding
programme it is almost certain that both subspecies will disappear from the
local scene as civilisation encroaches on their already limited habitat.
It is my belief that we may have the only Cayman Brae specimens out-
side their habitat. None of the local people could give me any information
regarding others coming to their island in recent times with any interest in
parrots. It is hoped that our quest will not stir up any such interest or every
child on the island will be stoning parrots in an attempt to catch them for

sale. Also, adults wishing to catch a parrot told me they used a gun which
sometimes proved fatal. We told them we would not pay for any specimen
so obtained and thereby put a stop to these birds being shot while we were
there.
In January 1975 when I returned to Grand Cayman from Cayman
Brae, I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Alexander Wetmore and showing
him the first specimens of A. 1 . hesterna he had ever seen. Dr. Wetmore had
just returned from hacking his way through the mangrove swamp with his
famous large knife which has travelled with him for so many years, in
order to see some of the many birds that winter on Grand Cayman. Dr.
Wetmore, at 89 years, is still very much involved with the Smithsonian
Institute and in his travels and writings. His writings, from the early
twenties to the present time, have given us so much of our present know-
ledge on birds of the Caribbean, Central and South America.
We have three pairs of the Cayman Brae Amazon and since our first
brother-sister pair are four years old, we hope for a first breeding from
them. They showed much interest in their nest box this spring past and
have steadily become more aggressive as breeding pairs tend to do.
Placing these specimens beside our five adult Cubans and twelve Grand
Cayman Amazons one is better able to get a true picture of the difference
that exists between these three parrots, as well as seeing the noticeable simi-
larity. There is as much difference between the nominate race and that of
Grand Cayman (A. 1 . caymanensis) as there is between a Blue-fronted
Amazon A. aestiva and the Orange-winged Amazon A. amazonica.
It has always fascinated me how the early ancestors of these Amazons
must have "island hopped", possibly borne by hurricanes, to span so
wide a range from the Caymans, Isle of Pines, Cuba and the Bahamas.
Consider the close relationship of the San Domingo Amazon (A. ventralis)
of Hispaniola and Gonave Island and the Yellow-billed Amazon (A.
collaria) of Jamaica, all of which must have had, due to the similarity, a
common ancestor. Many believe A. albifrons to have shared this common
ancestor. However, recent studies on St. Vincent and Dominica seem to
indicate that some of the island Amazons may be older than those on the
mainland. This would throw an entirely different complexion on the
situation, for one might speculate whether the original birds came from
Central and South America and worked their way north-eastward or
whether they originated from some bygone larger land mass in the Atlantic
and worked their way south-westward. We know that bones of A. 1 .
bahamensis found in caves date back three thousand years, showing the
early Amer-Indians used them for food and possibly kept them for pets.
While these few years are but a drop in the ocean of time who knows what
might yet be uncovered if we persist with an open mind?
On Cayman Brae there are an estimated 200 caves, and many on the
bluff that have yet to be discovered. The floor of Great Cave on the south-
east end of the island is littered with fossilized bones of a long extinct

rodent as well as bird and bat bones washed down into the cave from the
bluff top above. It would prove interesting to have this carbon-dated but
unfortunately little work of this kind had been done on the Brae. Many
speculate that these islands were never visited by any Amer-Indians, but this
seems unlikely and merely means that there might not have been a per-
manent settlement on them due to their lack of fresh water, though wells
can be dug and water often collects in deep holes on the bluff. At any rate,
as well travelled as these first Americans were, it is doubtful that they were
not aware of the Cayman Islands and landed on them. What telltale marks
they left in caves could have easily been destroyed by early pirates and
early settlers. During any future visit to Cayman Brae I intend to spend
more time in the caves in the hope of finding some indication of such
visitations or of the Brae Amazon.
The last four Cayman Brae specimens obtained from the wild have
proved fussy feeders and have taken longer to adjust to seeds, preferring
fruits and vegetables; however, once accustomed to this new diet, they
have all but refused other foods in preference to seeds. The two hand-
raised by Mr. Kendall Ryan make no such distinction but readily eat
anything offered them. I must here remark that among the parrot's
favourite foods on the island is the West Indian almond. The pulp sur-
rounding the nut is eaten when green or when it ripens to a rich orange or
red. The islanders all vouch for the parrots' love of this fruit and give it to
their pets as a supplement to seeds. Interestingly enough, the kernel of the
nut is seldom eaten.
These are indeed delightful Amazons, being active to the point of
nervousness. Add to this their vivid colouring and you have an adorable
bird. Let us hope that captive breeding proves successful so we can place
the offspring with other breeders to help ensure this beautiful Amazon for
posterity.

Restrictions on the import of birds into Britain have altered dramatically
in the past year. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora was signed in Washington, USA in 1973.
It was implemented by the UK Government on January 1st 1976 (under
the Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act 1939) and ratified
on August 2nd 1976. The earlier Wild Birds Importation Order (1970)
which had already restricted the import of birds of prey and owls was
incorporated, and the full implementation of the Washington Convention
was completed by the passage through Parliament of the Endangered
Species (Import and Export) Act 1976. At the same time, the Ministry of
Agriculture has imposed new import restrictions on all captive birds.

and licences to import or export any of these species have to be obtained
from the Department of the Environment. Appendix 1 (Endangered)
contains animals that were considered, by delegates at the original Conven-
tion, to be threatened by extinction and which are or may be threatened by
trade. Appendix 11 (Vulnerable) contains those that, although not at the
moment threatened with extinction, might become so unless trade is
subject to regulation. Appendix 11 also contains the so-called "look-alike"
species, those not threatened themselves but are so similar to a threatened
species that they are included to aid enforcement.

The British legislation follows the Convention closely with certain
variations and, to avoid confusion, the appendices are called List A and
List B. Licences for birds on List A are issued by the DOE only on the
advice of a Scientific Authority and they will not be issued for primarily
commercial purposes. All birds of prey and owls have been treated as
List A species. Permits are also required by contracting states to export
List A birds. Licences for the import of species on List B will normally be
issued readily on presentation of a permit to export from the country of
origin. Here the aim is merely to keep a check on what is being brought in
and out, and the DOE will publish statements of its findings at intervals.
Licences are required for listed species, whether the individual concerned
was taken from the wild or hatched in captivity: however, a licence to
import or export a List A bird is obviously more likely to be granted if it
can be shown to have been captive-bred.

Washington Convention were ill thought out and required modification.
To take some waterfowl examples--the Comb Duck, which is widespread
and locally a pest in Africa, S.E. Asia and India, is listed, apparently at the
request of a South American country where another race of the species also
occurs; Jankowski's Swan, the postulated eastern race, but barely dis-
tinguishable from the much rarer western Bewick's Swan, is listed, while
the Bewick's is not; Anas oustaleti from the Marianas Islands which,
according to most authorities, is not even a species but a hybrid, is listed.
The Chilean Flamingo, of which there are thought to be approximately
500,000 in the wild, is listed, while the much more sought-after Caribbean
Flamingo, with only 60,000 individuals, is not. At the moment, not even
all the IUCN Red Data Book species are included. Some of these discre-
pancies were to have been sorted out at an international meeting of the
parties to the original Convention held in Berne, Switzerland, in November
1976. However, time was too short, and the bird lists are still in a state of
some confusion. In general, it is likely that species will be added to the
lists rather than removed.
ic Import and Export by Air.
Incidentally, Washington Convention animals shipped by air must now
travel in crates that conform to I AT A regulations, and this is specified on
the licence.
2. An additional restriction that has affected UK aviculturists is the
Importation of Captive Birds Order (1976) which came into operation on
March 1st 1976, primarily to limit the spread of Newcastle disease. It
extends the Live Poultry and Hatching Eggs (Importation) Order (1972),
which had already subjected fowls, turkeys, geese, ducks, guineafowl,
pheasants, partridges and quail to control. The conditions for import of
these exotic poultry (for example, all wildfowl except swans, screamers and
flamingos) are now tightened so as to be similar to the conditions for the
import of parrots. Exotic poultry and parrots are thought to be more likely
to introduce Newcastle disease to the UK's domestic poultry flocks than
other bird groups. The new order prohibits, except under licence from the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the importation of all
captive birds or hatching eggs, and these normally have to be retained in
quarantine or isolation, for 35 days at premises approved by MAFF.

At the moment, a "non-psittacine concession" (which, remember, does
not apply to exotic poultry) is in operation until importers are able to
establish their own quarantine premises, and this concession is to be con-
tinued indefinitely. There is also a concession under which up to 12 parrots
or exotic poultry (or eggs) can be imported from a country of low disease
risk (currently Western Europe, North America, Iceland, South Africa,
Australia and New Zealand). But these birds, or the females laying the

certificate from a veterinary officer.
2b Isolation.
Such "concessionary" birds need only be "isolated" for 35 days and
visited by a local Veterinary Inspector. Isolation premises can be within
the owner's home or establishment, and must be approved by a Veterinary
Officer at a normal cost of #35. In the case of isolated imports, staff may
tend both imported and resident birds, but are advised to take hygienic
precautions.
2c Quarantine.
Full quarantine, on the other hand, is required for shipments of more

<bodyText confidence="0.943694055555556" page_id="56381847"  page_num="212" year="" vol="">
than 12 parrots or exotic poultry (or eggs), or for any number from a high
risk area (currently including the Near and Far East and most of Africa and
South America), or for any birds or their eggs that have not been in cap-
tivity for 28 days. Quarantine premises have to be J mile from the nearest
concentration of birds, including domestic poultry. "Control" birds, un-
vaccinated domestic chicks between four and eight weeks old, must be held
in the same air space as the imported ones. The controls will be tested for
Newcastle disease at the beginning and end of the quarantine period.
Even with "isolated" imported birds, the Ministry retains the option to
require controls. Any birds that die while in quarantine or isolation will be
examined post mortem by MAFF.
Quarantine or isolation extends for 35 days from the date of the last
import, or when the last imported egg hatches, and the minimum interval
between quarantines or isolations is seven days. Staff tending birds in full
quarantine must not be involved in the care of other resident birds. To
ensure responsible supervision, owners or managers may visit imports in
quarantine after undergoing strict disinfection procedures and under-
taking that they will not have contact with other birds for the next 12 hours.

The Government has now subjected the majority of bird species to
licence. List A in the British Endangered Species Act 1976 is still equivalent
to Appendix 1 of the Washington Convention, but most other species are
now on list B. There are one or two exceptions; in the case of waterfowl
for instance, domestic forms of the Mallard, Muscovy Duck, Greylag and
Chinese Goose are excepted kinds.
The Notice to Importers and Exporters dated January 17th 1977 should
be obtained from the Department of the Environment.

By J. Delacour (Cleres, Seine Maritime)
During a recent visit to Orlando, Florida, on the occasion of the annual
meeting of the International Wild Waterfowl Association, I had the pleasure
of visiting the fine collection of birds that Dr. and Mrs. Michael Dam main-
tain in the neighbourhood with the enthusiastic assistance of their two
young daughters. The grounds are extensive, with large ponds: the
almost tropical climate is excellent for birds from warm countries and very
wisely, none from the colder areas are tried there. There are several
hundreds of birds ranging from Ostriches, rheas and Emus to waterfowl
and game birds housed in roomy, well built and well planted aviaries, and
the breeding results are highly satisfactory. The pheasantry contains such
rare species as Bulwer's and all the different firebacks, Argus and peacock
pheasants, Horsfield's and Edwards's, the last named in some numbers.
There are many swans, particularly Black Swans which live and breed in a
large colony: they are literally resting in a thick bed of duckweed, which
covers the waters. These most useful and nourishing floating plants grow so
fast there that the birds cannot eat them all as they do in less favourable
places. Great success is met with Radjah Shelducks, of which I saw well
over a hundred-Orinoco and Maned Geese, and a number of tropical and
subtropical ducks: tame Sandhill Cranes roam the grounds.
There is in the vicinity of Orlando an excellent replica of the Sea
World of San Diego, and it also displays a beautiful collection of waterfowl,
flamingos and penguins under the supervision of Mr. Frank Todd and the
care of Mr. E. Asper. Many species breed there and the grounds are
beautifully landscaped, planted and kept.
The very large Disneyland, also in the area, includes a vast freshwater
lake with, in the middle of it, a "Treasure Island", most cleverly landscaped
and planted, which is a dream of a tropical jungle. There are several big,
well camouflaged flights, with macaws and other parrots, birds of prey,
waterfowl, game birds and, particularly, a huge one which visitors enter
and cross on a long rustic, winding bridge--Scarlet and Sacred Ibises,
Argus, Palawan Peacock Pheasants, hornbills, toucans. Crowned Pigeons,
whistling ducks and a few other suitable species are discovered here and
there, just as they would be in their natural habitats, and it is a most
successful exhibit. A flamingo lagoon follows before you reach the sandy
beach and board a boat to leave that enchanted island.

suddenly became intolerant towards the others which, therefore, had to be
removed and at the end of June the pair had built a large nest of branches,
leaves, and grass and on July 3rd and 5th two eggs were laid. As this
species had never before bred in our zoo, we took the eggs away and put
them into an incubator. On July 9th and 12th the third and fourth eggs
were laid which we also took to the incubator, and in exchange we put a
goose egg into the nest: after three days the cranes stopped brooding. On

July 29th and 31st she laid the fifth and sixth eggs. While the last four eggs
were infertile, two chicks hatched on August 4th and 5th after an incuba-
tion period of 30 and 31 days. The nestlings were tawny and pale chestnut,
darkest on the crowns of their heads and down the centre of their backs.
They were hand-reared successfully by the head keeper of our bird section
and fed a special diet consisting of insects, young mice, etc. Since then the
young birds have changed their appearance very much. Now they have the
top of their heads buff and black and a short crest: their cheeks are covered
in buff-coloured down and their mantles and scapulars are tipped with
dark tawny. This year the breeding pair will occupy the same enclosure in
the hope that nesting will again be successful.

By J. Delacour
Once again freak weather played havoc with the birds in 1976: we had a
very hard frost at the end of May, when many waterfowl were ready to nest,
and it just stopped them. Many species simply did not lay, not even usually
reliable breeders such as Black Brant and Ross's Geese; we had no eggs
from Red-breasted and very few young from Emperor, Greenland
White-fronted, Bar-headed and Swan Geese. Unfortunate hybrids
cropped up in the broods, Emperor x Bar-headed, Barnacle x Emperor,
Barnacle x Bar-headed and Black Brant x Cackling. It is inadvisable to rear
together chicks of different species, as they may become imprinted to each
other and pair badly.
Sarus, Demoiselle and Crowned Cranes never nested at all, but a pair of
Wattled Cranes laid seven eggs, all of them infertile. A fair number of
ducks were reared, none particularly rare. Among the young pheasants
were seven Edwards's, four being females. Our collection has been much
improved thanks to the generosity of Mr. C. Sivelle, Mr. K. Howman and
Major I. Grahame, who sent us pairs of Bornean and Malay Firebacks,
Ijima's Copper, Cheer and other pheasants; also Germain's Peacock
Pheasants. We also acquired Bronze-tailed Peacock Pheasants, a species
recorded breeding in captivity for the first time at Cleres before the war.
A number of doves were reared, particularly Mountain Witch and
Bleeding Heart. It was a good year for touracous and we raised four
Senegal, three Knysna and one White-cheeked; the latter was produced by
a pair living at Cleres for more than 20 years. They had never nested
successfully before and they are of such a murderous disposition that they
have to be kept strictly by themselves in a separate aviary, as they attack
even large pheasants.
The flamingos settled down to breed on the southern bank of the lake in
May, building their own nests without any help, the Caribbean seven,

Writing from Ljungbyhed, Sweden, Mats Tell says, "It seems that my
birds enjoyed the drought and heat during the 1976 summer, but the
breeding results were poor. I bred five Virginian Cardinals, five Green
Avadavats, four Silver-eared Mesias, five Sun Conures, and one Bourke's
Parrakeet. My two pairs of Eclectus (vosmaeri) had eggs, but these did not
hatch; the Lesser Patagonian Conures did not go to nest and there were no
young Aymara Parrakeets. The old hen hatched some chicks, but did not
feed them and the young pair had infertile eggs".

A pair of Sharp-tailed Conures Aratinga acuticauda belonging to Mr. K.
Bastien bred three young in 1971, possibly a first British breeding of this
species. Mr. Bastien, now curator of the Tropical Bird Park at St Lawrence,
near Ventnor, Isle of Wight has informed us that the pair has reared young
each year since then, three or four being raised on each occasion except for
1976 when only two were reared. To date every chick hatched has left the
nest and nine of the young birds have been retained to fly in a large aviary
with other conures. Some have been sold as pets and have compared
favourably with macaws, becoming tame and affectionate and learning to
talk a little. The young birds which fly together have not attempted to
breed, probably, as Mr. Bastien points out, because they will not nest in the
company of others. When the young birds were left with the original pair,
the adults made no attempt to breed, but the hen would be inside the nest
within three or four days of their removal.
A few of the young birds have very brightly coloured red spots on the
shoulder or leading edge of the wing, a feature which is not present in the
adults.

The notes on the Blakistcn's Fish Owl published in the April-June
edition of the Magazine prompted Mats Tell to send details of another
example of this rarely exhibited species. Mr. Sten Bergman, writing in his
book djur (Animals), states that in 1930 he encountered a hand-reared
Blakiston's Fish Owl being kept as a pet by a Japanese gentleman named
Hirose who lived in the town of Nemuro on the island of Jesso. This owl
had been captured, as a baby, the previous year on the island of Kunashiri
and was reportedly reared on an unlikely diet of condensed milk and
when older, it was fed entirely on fish. This bird was subsequently given to

by Dr. Bergman who attempted to pair it to a Great Eagle Owl Bubo b. bubo

The White-tailed Sea Eagle Haliaetus albicilla also enjoyed quite a
successful breeding season in Sweden last year with about 15 young safely
reared. Swedish conservationists think that this improved result may partly
be attributable to the fact that food is now laid out for resident pairs during
the difficult months of winter. It is believed that, in winter, the Swedish
population of White-tailed Sea Eagles obtained much of their food by
scavenging wolf kills and now that wolves are almost extinct this source of
food is no longer available. It is therefore reasoned that this factor might
account for the decline of this species in inland areas and as a result the
feeding programme was instigated.
The December edition of the bulletin of the b.o.c. contains what is
believed to be the first written description of the nest and egg of the
Fischer's Turaco Tauraco fischeri. P. L. and H. A. Britton report that a
nest was located at a height of 25 ft. in the canopy of a msambarau Syzygium
cumini tree at Mombasa, Kenya. The nest was inspected after it had been
deserted and was found to consist of an unlined, loosely constructed
platform of twigs. The single egg that it contained was greyish-white and
almost spherical, measuring 36.1 x 34.6 mm and weighed 22.6 g (about
8-11 per cent of body weight).

The R.S.P.B. has released a new report entitled airborne birds. This
booklet gives an account of the birds imported into Britain during 1975/
1976 together with details of packing, mortality etc. It is reported that
about 371,000 birds were imported into Britain during 1975. In addition,
about 323,500 birds passed through Heathrow Airport en route to other
countries. The mortality rate of birds passing through the R.S.P.C.A. hostel
at Heathrow during 1975 is shown to be 3.9 per cent in the case of imported
birds and 2.2 per cent in the case of birds in transit.

Mating Display in the Stripe-Breasted Starthroat Hummingbird
As far as I am aware, the brief description by R. J. Elgar (A.M. 1976 pp
83-84) of the display in the Stripe-breasted Starthroat Heliomaster
squamosus , is the first time anything has been written (in English) on the
subject. I would therefore like to enlarge a little on the actual display.
Many species of hummingbirds, even when from a different genus,
perform displays which are similar; however, of the species I have studied,
none has a display remotely like that of the Heliomaster . As Mr. Elgar states,
when displaying the Stripe-breasted (usually) hovers in front and a little
below the bird to which the display is being directed. I have found, how-
ever, that should the starthroat display to a bird which is perched near to
the ground, it will hover above the latter, with the head and beak directed
downwards. The movements described by Elgar as "jerky" are in fact
caused through the bird folding the wings against the body, thus causing it
to drop approximately 4 or 5 inches, when it will open the wings and rise
again to its original position. The opening and closing of the wings causes
the bird to rise and fall extremely rapidly, each position being held for only
a matter of a second. During the performance, the wing-beats are so rapid,
they make a "zumming" sound and throughout the display one can hear an
intermittent "zum - zum - zum" etc. The tail feathers are fanned during the
downward movement and closed during the upward.
Elgar describes the song as "chr chr chr tss". I always find great difficulty
in putting bird-song down on paper; however, I consider the advertising

song of the Stripe-breasted Starthroat to be much more drawn out than
Elgar's description would suggest, with the "chr" note lasting approxi-
mately ij seconds. There appear to be two forms of "chr-ing" notes, one
slightly higher pitched than the other, the former being used as the bird
inhales and the latter as the bird exhales.
The Stripe-breasted Starthroat in Mr. Elgar's collection was in fact
acquired for him by me and during the few days it spent in my birdroom
awaiting collection, I was able to compare its song with that of my bird.
Although basically much alike, there is a recognisable difference between
the two songs; that of Elgar's bird having the more usual drawn-out notes,
whereas my bird has a stuttering-type song. There is also difference in
plumage coloration, my bird being lighter than Elgar's. Differences in song
patterns from the same hummingbird species have been recorded when the
birds in question have been taken from different areas: however, I have not
heard of differences in plumage coloration when the species concerned has
no known races.
The taking hold of a bird's throat or breast feathers by a displaying
Stripe-breasted is, in my opinion, a form of "vent-pecking". I believe this
to be so as my Stripe-breasted can be seen to take hold of a bird's vent
feathers rather than those of the throat or breast. I described this activity
in the Andean Emerald Hummingbird Amazilia franciae (A.M. 1972
PP 1 73-176). Little appears to be known with regard to this activity in
hummingbirds. Skead (1967) in Sunbirds of Southern Africa; (also
Sugarbirds, White-Eyes and the Spotted Creeper), describes it as
"common to all sunbirds" and as having "a place in the courtship display"
and believes it to be a form of copulatory stimulation practised by the male.
As "vent-pecking" in the Trochilidae appears to be used only during or
immediately after mating display, it is possible the same applies to this
family.

There are certainly many species which, for one reason or another,
aviculturists should not attempt to maintain in captivity. However, Alastair
Morrison's suggestion (avicultural magazine, April---June 1976,
page 117) that the Avicultural Society should draw up a list of such
species is impractical and his opinion that Hooded and Golden-shouldered
Parrots should be prominent on the list is preposterous. No one will deny
that aviculture has an important part to play in the conservation of species
which are in danger of extinction, and the establishment of strains of

species which adapt themselves particularly well to conditions in captivity
is an equally fascinating and important aspect of aviculture.
It is reassuring to learn that the status in the wild of Hooded and Golden-
shouldered Parrots is not threatened despite the fact that their geographical
distribution is so limited: however, the inaccessibility of the parts of
Australia which they inhabit is so great that few ornithologists will ever be
lucky enough to enjoy the excitement and privilege of seeing them in the
field. I have not been fortunate enough to possess the Golden-shouldered,
but I have had Hooded Parrots which, with their charm and incredible
beauty, were the most delightful birds I have ever kept. I have visited many
aviaries in Europe and Australia where the two are kept and bred success-
fully and their owners are unanimous about their many attributes. Many
more would probably be bred in Europe if it were not for their tendency to
moult in the summer but, in this respect, they represent a challenge to the
aviculturist and provide opportunity for the scientific study of unusual
breeding behaviour.
The fact that some European aviculturists are willing to pay very high
prices for them is only a reflection of their desirability. They are valuable
because they do well in captivity and are likely to breed and give their
owners some return for their money. Considerably more rare species
unlikely to become domesticated will never become so valuable.
It is a tragedy that large numbers of Hooded and Golden-shouldered
have perished as a result of the deplorable activities of parrot smugglers;
however, aviary-bred birds were probably more readily obtainable for
illegal export than wild-caught specimens. On the other hand, smuggling
activities have resulted in a regrettable reduction in the aviary population.
If only the Australian authorities would permit the licensed export of
limited numbers of Hooded and Golden-shouldered Parrots, a domesti-
cated strain of both would surely be developed rapidly in Europe, as has
been done in Australia, for the delight of us all. There can be few species
more suitable for aviculture.

J. R. Hodges
With reference to Mr. Morrison's letter in the April/June issue of the
Magazine. I feel that certain basic inaccuracies cannot be allowed to pass
unchallenged, as the above letter considerably underestimates the role of
aviculture in conservation.
I have no quarrel with Mr. Morrison's views on the two rare parrakeets
mentioned, as I have had few dealings with this group of birds. Possibly
these are too small in number to warrant the taking of individuals to add to
a captive population. However, it must be advantageous for any species to
have a captive self-sustaining population in addition to the natural one.

With a common species this provides research material without unduly
disturbing the wild population; the more that is known about a species, the
better it can be conserved in the light of such knowledge. Where endanger-
ed species are concerned, in addition to the above research facility, a
captive stock provides an insurance against the species becoming extinct
altogether. This is especially the case with island species such as the
Laysan Teal; disease or introduced predators could wipe out the wild popu-
lation of this duck with ease. However, the island could be swiftly re-
stocked with captive-bred birds once the cause of extinction had gone.
It is perhaps as well to remember that certain species ---notably Imperial
Lophura imperialis and Edwards's L. edwardsi Pheasants will certainly owe
their long-term survival, if any, to captive propagation. Mr. Morrison's
sweeping condemnation of all those possessing rare animals is ill advised.
Had M. Jean Delacour not collected the original pair of Imperial Pheasants
and taken them to Normandy in 1923, the species would almost certainly
not exist today.
